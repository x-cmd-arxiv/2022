generally regarded as the ""final frontiers"" at which space-time ends and
general relativity breaks down. We review the status of such space-like
singularities from three increasingly more general perspectives. They are
provided by (i) A reformulation of classical general relativity motivated by
the Belinskii, Khalatnikov, Lifshitz conjecture on the behavior of the
gravitational field near space-like singularities; (ii) The use of test quantum
fields to probe the nature of these singularities; and, (iii) An analysis of
the fate of these singularities in loop quantum gravity due to quantum geometry
effects. At all three levels singularities turn out to be less menacing than
one might a priori expect from classical general relativity. Our goal is to
present an overview of the emerging conceptual picture and suggest lines for
further work. In line with the \emph{Introduction to Current Research} theme,
we have made an attempt to make it easily accessible to all researchers in
gravitational physics.

this paper, we take steps towards addressing these issues. By exploiting the
explicit relationship between point clouds and image pixels, a dataset
annotation pipeline is designed to automatically generate high-quality 3D lane

an extrinsic-free, anchor-free method, called SALAD, regressing the 3D

bird's-eye view (BEV). To facilitate future research on 3D lane detection, we
benchmark the dataset and provide a novel evaluation metric, performing
extensive experiments of both existing approaches and our proposed method. The

of synthesizing information from multi-modal resources to address the complex
tasks raised from real-life applications. Recently, many large multi-modal
datasets have been collected, on which researchers actively explore different
methods of fusing multi-modal information. However, little attention has been
paid to quantifying the contribution of different modalities within the
proposed models. In this paper, we propose the {\bf SH}apley v{\bf A}lue-based
{\bf PE}rceptual (SHAPE) scores that measure the marginal contribution of
individual modalities and the degree of cooperation across modalities. Using
these scores, we systematically evaluate different fusion methods on different
multi-modal datasets for different tasks. Our experiments suggest that for some
tasks where different modalities are complementary, the multi-modal models
still tend to use the dominant modality alone and ignore the cooperation across
modalities. On the other hand, models learn to exploit cross-modal cooperation
when different modalities are indispensable for the task. In this case, the
scores indicate it is better to fuse different modalities at relatively early
stages. We hope our scores can help improve the understanding of how the
present multi-modal models operate on different modalities and encourage more
sophisticated methods of integrating multiple modalities.

designed graphic layout data, previous work suggests masking design elements

alignment module (DAM) to narrow this gap. For training, we built a large-scale
layout dataset which consists of 60,548 advertising posters with annotated

approach using reinforcement learning, without recourse to motion capture data.
The method first takes advantage of a strong character model, which facilitates
the discovery of solution modes. A second stage then learns to adapt the
control policy to work with progressively weaker versions of the character.
Finally, a third stage learns control policies that can reproduce the weaker
get-up motions at much slower speeds. We show that across multiple runs, the
method can discover a diverse variety of get-up strategies, and execute them at
a variety of speeds. The results usually produce policies that use a final
stand-up strategy that is common to the recovery motions seen from all initial
states. However, we also find policies for which different strategies are seen
for prone and supine initial fallen states. The learned get-up control
strategies often have significant static stability, i.e., they can be paused at
a variety of points during the get-up motion. We further test our method on
novel constrained scenarios, such as having a leg and an arm in a cast.

response of a fault under large coseismic slip. We investigate the role of the
seismic slip velocity, mixture compressibility, characteristic grain size and
viscosity parameter in the frictional response of the coupled
thermo-hydro-mechanical problem, taking into account the fault's
microstructure. Starting from the mass, energy and momentum balance for
Cosserat continua we derive the equations of our model. We complete the
mathematical description using perfect plasticity and Perzyna viscoplasticity
in the material constitutive behavior. We investigate both the rate independent
as well as the rate dependent frictional response and compare with existing
models found in literature, namely the rate and state friction law (Dieterich

rate hardening and velocity softening without the assumption of a state

oscillations in the fault's frictional response, like in the case of Portevin
Le Chatelier (PLC) effect. This behavior is not captured by existing numerical
analyses presented in Rattez et al. (2018c,b,a) and go beyond the established
models of uniform shear (Lachenbruch (1980)) and shear on a mathematical plane

bounded fault gouge under largecoseismic slip. We did so by taking into account
the evolution of the Principal Slip Zone (PSZ) thickness using a Cosserat
micromorphic continuum model for the description of the fault's mechanical
response. The numerical results obtained differ significantly from those
predicted by the established model of thermal pressurization during slip on a
mathematical plane (see Mase and Smith (1987); Rice (2006a); Platt et al.
(2014a) among others). These differences prompt us to reconsider the basic
assumptions of a stationary strain localization on an unbounded domain present
in the original model. We depart from these assumptions, extending the model to
incorporate different strain localization modes, temperature and pore fluid
pressure boundary conditions. The new model allows us to gain significant
understanding of the detailed numerical results of Part I. We investigate the
influence of a traveling strain localization inside the fault gouge considering
isothermal, drained boundary conditions for the bounded and unbounded domain
respectively. Our results establish that when a stationary strain localization
profile is applied on a bounded domain, the boundary conditions lead to a
steady state, where total strength regain is achieved. In the case of a
traveling instability such a steady state is not possible and the fault only
regains part of its frictional strength, depending on the seismic slip velocity
and the traveling velocity of the shear band. In this case frictional
oscillations increasing the frequency content of the earthquake are also
developed. Our results indicate a reappraisal of the role of thermal
pressurization as a frictional weakening mechanism.

large city. This effect is characterized by higher air temperatures in cities
than in the neighboring countryside at night. However, to date, there has been
no systematic study on the Fortaleza case, the Brazil's 5th largest city. By
the comparison between screen-level air temperature measured by two automatic
weather stations, one located in the city and the other in the neighboring
region, this work shows the occurrence of the UHI in Fortaleza, even during the
rainy season. In an attempt to find some effect of the UHI on precipitation
(and vice-versa), historical series of air temperature and precipitation were
analyzed from 1966 to 2020. Besides the considerable increase in air
temperature over the years, a slight downward trend was observed in UHI and
even more in accumulated precipitation between the hours of 15:00 and 21:00

change at large scale rather than an urban scale.

models that can act as effective feature extractors on a variety of downstream
tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we study the efficacy of pre-trained
vision models as a foundation for downstream continual learning (CL) scenarios.
Our goal is twofold. First, we want to understand the compute-accuracy
trade-off between CL in the raw-data space and in the latent space of
pre-trained encoders. Second, we investigate how the characteristics of the
encoder, the pre-training algorithm and data, as well as of the resulting
latent space affect CL performance. For this, we compare the efficacy of
various pre-trained models in large-scale benchmarking scenarios with a vanilla
replay setting applied in the latent and in the raw-data space. Notably, this
study shows how transfer, forgetting, task similarity and learning are
dependent on the input data characteristics and not necessarily on the CL
algorithms. First, we show that under some circumstances reasonable CL
performance can readily be achieved with a non-parametric classifier at
negligible compute. We then show how models pre-trained on broader data result
in better performance for various replay sizes. We explain this with
representational similarity and transfer properties of these representations.
Finally, we show the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training for
downstream domains that are out-of-distribution as compared to the pre-training
domain. We point out and validate several research directions that can further
increase the efficacy of latent CL including representation ensembling. The
diverse set of datasets used in this study can serve as a compute-efficient
playground for further CL research. The codebase is available under

alternative to two-level qubits for quantum computation and communication. So
far, photon loss has been the dominant source of errors in bosonic qubits, but
the significant reduction of photon loss in recent bosonic qubit experiments
suggests that dephasing errors should also be considered. However, a detailed
understanding of the combined photon loss and dephasing channel is lacking.
Here, we show that, unlike its constituent parts, the combined loss-dephasing
channel is non-degradable, pointing towards a richer structure of this channel.
We provide bounds for the capacity of the loss-dephasing channel and use
numerical optimization to find optimal single-mode codes for a wide range of
error rates.

multivariate polynomial, given as a coefficient vector, simultaneously at
multiple evaluation points. In this work, we show that there exists a
deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over any finite
field $\mathbb{F}$ that outputs the evaluations of an $m$-variate polynomial of
degree less than $d$ in each variable at $N$ points in time \[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot\poly(m,d,\log|\mathbb{F}|) \] for all $m\in\N$ and all
sufficiently large $d\in\mathbb{N}$.
  A previous work of Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008, SICOMP 2011) achieved the
same time complexity when the number of variables $m$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ and
had left the problem of removing this condition as an open problem. A recent
work of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra (STOC 2022) answered this question
when the underlying field is not \emph{too} large and has characteristic less
than $d^{o(1)}$. In this work, we remove this constraint on the number of
variables over all finite fields, thereby answering the question of Kedlaya and
Umans over all finite fields.
  Our algorithm relies on a non-trivial combination of ideas from three
seemingly different previously known algorithms for multivariate multipoint
evaluation, namely the algorithms of Kedlaya and Umans, that of Bj\""orklund,
Kaski and Williams (IPEC 2017, Algorithmica 2019), and that of Bhargava, Ghosh,
Kumar and Mohapatra, together with a result of Bombieri and Vinogradov from
analytic number theory about the distribution of primes in an arithmetic
progression.
  We also present a second algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation
that is completely elementary and in particular, avoids the use of the
Bombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. However, it requires a mild assumption that the
field size is bounded by an exponential-tower in $d$ of bounded
\textit{height}.

research in all fields of science and engineering. Among its central topics
stands the problem of modeling and propagating distributional uncertainty,
i.e., the uncertainty about probability distributions. In this paper, we employ
tools from Optimal Transport to capture distributional uncertainty via Optimal
Transport ambiguity sets, which we show to be very natural and expressive, and
to enjoy powerful topological, geometrical, computational, and statistical
features and guarantees. We show that these ambiguity sets propagate nicely and
intuitively through nonlinear, possibly corrupted by noise, transformations,
and that in many cases the result of the propagation is again an Optimal
Transport ambiguity set. Moreover, whenever this is not the case, we show that
the result of the propagation can be tightly upper bounded by another Optimal
Transport ambiguity set. Importantly, our methodology allows us to capture
exactly how complex systems shape distributional uncertainty. To conclude, we
exemplify our findings in three fundamental applications in forward
propagation, inverse problems, and distributionally robust optimization.

devise ways to adapt related data sources for this task to provide more
explicit supervision for incorporating the opponent's preferences and offers,
as a proxy to relying on granular utterance-level annotations. We show the

  Workshop @CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Image compositing is one of the most fundamental steps in creative workflows.
It involves taking objects/parts of several images to create a new image,
called a composite. Currently, this process is done manually by creating
accurate masks of objects to be inserted and carefully blending them with the
target scene or images, usually with the help of tools such as Photoshop or
GIMP. While there have been several works on automatic selection of objects for
creating masks, the problem of object placement within an image with the
correct position, scale, and harmony remains a difficult problem with limited
exploration. Automatic object insertion in images or designs is a difficult
problem as it requires understanding of the scene geometry and the color
harmony between objects. We propose LayoutBERT for the object insertion task.
It uses a novel self-supervised masked language model objective and
bidirectional multi-head self-attention. It outperforms previous layout-based
likelihood models and shows favorable properties in terms of model capacity. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for object insertion in the image
compositing setting and other settings like documents and design templates. We
further demonstrate the usefulness of the learned representations for
layout-based retrieval tasks. We provide both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on datasets from diverse domains like COCO, PublayNet, and two new
datasets which we call Image Layouts and Template Layouts. Image Layouts which
consists of 5.8 million images with layout annotations is the largest image
layout dataset to our knowledge. We also share ablation study results on the

CoLN is capable of combining several distributed neural networks of the same

companion planting -- growing different species of plants in close proximity so
they can mutually benefit each other. However, the determination of companion
plants requires meticulous monitoring of plant growth. The technique of ocular
monitoring is often laborious and error prone. The availability of image
processing techniques can be used to address the challenge of plant growth
monitoring and provide robust solutions that assist plant scientists to
identify companion plants. This paper presents a new image processing algorithm
to determine the amount of vegetation cover present in a given area, called
fractional vegetation cover. The proposed technique draws inspiration from the
trusted Daubenmire method for vegetation cover estimation and expands upon it.
Briefly, the idea is to estimate vegetation cover from images containing
multiple rows of plant species growing in close proximity separated by a
multi-segment PVC frame of known size. The proposed algorithm applies a Hough
Transform and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) to estimate the amount
of vegetation cover within each segment of the PVC frame. The analysis when
repeated over images captured at regular intervals of time provides crucial
insights into plant growth. As a means of comparison, the proposed algorithm is
compared with SamplePoint and Canopeo, two trusted applications used for
vegetation cover estimation. The comparison shows a 99% similarity with both
SamplePoint and Canopeo demonstrating the accuracy and feasibility of the

in pico- and nanosecond time domain was developed on the basis on the quantum

particular, the model provided a new insight into the nature of the Decay
Associated Spectra (DAS) phenomenon. The analysis of the role of pico- and
nanosecond quenching in NADH suggested that the picosecond decay in methanol
and ethanol likely does not occur through electron transfer in the stacking
configuration of the nicotinamide and adenine moieties, but through other
mechanisms. However in propylene glycol the picosecond quenching in NADH
depended strongly on propylene glycol concentration and sharp increase of the
measured quantum yield was associated with the contribution of both picosecond

to depend significantly on the any alcohol concentration suggesting that it
gives a profound contribution to the rise of the measured quantum yield with

solution. This paper proposes using a modified particle swarm optimization

to perform the global search and find a reasonable search space. The algorithm
modifies the search space of each particle based on its fitness function value

better accuracy and convergence rate. We prove the efficiency of the MPSO
algorithm by comparing it with the standard PSO and six other well-known
metaheuristic algorithms when optimizing the adaptive fuzzy logic controller of
the 3-DOF helicopter. The proposed method's effectiveness is shown through
computer simulations while the system is subject to uncertainties and

whether any construction methods are economically superior to others. Some
proposed methods require large amounts of mass transported from the Earth,
others require high energy consumption on the lunar surface, and others have a
long construction time. Each of these factors contributes direct and indirect
costs to lunar activities. The most important economic variables turn out to be
the transportation cost to the lunar surface and the magnitude of the program
delay cost imposed by a construction method. The cost of a landing pad depends
sensitively on the optimization of the mass and speed of the construction
equipment, so a minimum-cost set of equipment exists for each construction
method within a specified economic scenario. Several scenarios have been
analyzed across a range of transportation costs with both high and low program
delay costs. It is found that microwave sintering is currently the most
favorable method to build the inner, high temperature zone of a lunar landing
pad, although other methods are within the range of uncertainty. The most
favorable method to build the outer, low temperature zone of the landing pad is
also sintering when transportation costs are high, but it switches to polymer
infusion when transportation costs drop below about \$110K/kg to the lunar
surface. It is estimated that the Artemis Basecamp could build a landing pad
with a budgeted line-item cost of \$229M assuming that transportation costs
will be reduced modestly from the current rate \$1M/kg to the lunar surface to
\$300K/kg. A landing pad drops to \$130M when the transportation cost drops
further to \$100K/kg, or to \$47M if transportation costs fall below \$10K/kg.
Ultimately, landing pads can be built around the Moon at very low cost, due to
economies of scale.

easily submerged in unrelated information. Instead, the facial landmark is a
low-dimensional and compact modality, which achieves lower computational cost
and potentially concentrates on ME-related movement features. However, the
discriminability of facial landmarks for MER is unclear. Thus, this paper
explores the contribution of facial landmarks and proposes a novel framework to
efficiently recognize MEs. Firstly, a geometric two-stream graph network is
constructed to aggregate the low-order and high-order geometric movement
information from facial landmarks to obtain discriminative ME representation.
Secondly, a self-learning fashion is introduced to automatically model the
dynamic relationship between nodes even long-distance nodes. Furthermore, an
adaptive action unit loss is proposed to reasonably build the strong
correlation between landmarks, facial action units and MEs. Notably, this work
provides a novel idea with much higher efficiency to promote MER, only
utilizing graph-based geometric features. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves competitive performance with a significantly
reduced computational cost. Furthermore, facial landmarks significantly
contribute to MER and are worth further study for high-efficient ME analysis.

strain, a combination of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and X-ray

of ferroelastic twin domains upon increasing the PbCl2 content, indicating an
increase in crystal strain. The XRD spectra support this observation with
strong crystal twinning features that appear in the spectra. This behaviour is
caused by a strain gradient during the crystallization due to different
evaporation rates of methylammonium acetate and methylammonium chloride as
revealed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) and
grazing incidince x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. Additional
time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) show an increased carrier lifetime in
the MAPbI3 films prepared with higher PbCl2 content, suggesting a decreased
trap density in films with larger twin domain structures. The results
demonstrate the potential of chemical strain engineering as an easy method for
controlling strain-related effects in lead halide perovskites.

the issue of annotation scarcity and class imbalance by leveraging on the
effectiveness of transfer learning. Apart from event extraction, we place
special emphasis on event properties (Polarity, Modality, and Intensity)
classification to determine the factual certainty of each event. We build
baseline models first by supervised learning and then exploit Transfer Learning
methods to boost event extraction model performance despite the limited amount
of annotated data and severe class imbalance. This is done via methods within
the transfer learning framework such as Domain Adaptive Pre-training,
Multi-task Learning and Sequential Transfer Learning. Based on experiment
results, we are able to improve all event extraction sub-task models both in F1

is very useful for downstream tasks such as understanding event chains and

in topological materials, which is promising for potential applications on

that correlates the LPMR with the Berry curvature, based on a ferromagnetic
Weyl semimetal CoS2 that bears the largest LPMR of over 500% at 2 Kelvin and 9
Tesla, among known magnetic topological semimetals. In this system, masses of
Weyl nodes existing near the Fermi level, revealed by theoretical calculations,
serve as Berry-curvature monopoles and low-effective-mass carriers. Based on
the Weyl picture, we propose a relation \[\text{MR}=\frac{e}{\hbar }B{{\Omega

introduce temperature factor to both MR/B slope (MR per unit field) and
anomalous Hall conductivity, which establishes the connection between the model

Internet of Things (IoT). Trust helps to resolve choices into a decision.
However, the trust calculation depends on the amount of uncertainty present in
data sources. Trust in an IoT network is proportional to the amount of
uncertainty generated by such sources as hardware malfunctions, network
stability, adversarial issues, and the nature of data exchanged between the
entities. The relationship between trust and uncertainty warrants approaches
designed to maximize the former quality whilst minimizing the latter.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on an approach to ensure the
trustworthiness of IoT networks, in particular, addressing the uncertainty
issues in a fine-grained way. This paper aims to explore a generalized
framework designed to manage trust in IoT networks of varying scales. In the
proposed framework, several sources of uncertainty are expressed as quantities,
trust ratings are calculated for individual entities in an IoT network, and a
network model capable of effectively distributing workloads to trustworthy
nodes is proposed. We consider a practical use case of smart vehicular
networks. By realizing this paper, a standardized approach to building
trustworthy IoT networks can be established, which can further guide subsequent
works in the field of trust management under uncertainty.

  Distance-Awareness","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2006.10108",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurate uncertainty quantification is a major challenge in deep learning, as
neural networks can make overconfident errors and assign high confidence
predictions to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. The most popular approaches to
estimate predictive uncertainty in deep learning are methods that combine
predictions from multiple neural networks, such as Bayesian neural networks
(BNNs) and deep ensembles. However their practicality in real-time,
industrial-scale applications are limited due to the high memory and
computational cost. Furthermore, ensembles and BNNs do not necessarily fix all
the issues with the underlying member networks. In this work, we study
principled approaches to improve uncertainty property of a single network,
based on a single, deterministic representation. By formalizing the uncertainty
quantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify distance
awareness, i.e., the model's ability to quantify the distance of a testing
example from the training data, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve
high-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose
Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that
improves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs with two simple changes:
(1) applying spectral normalization to hidden weights to enforce bi-Lipschitz
smoothness in representations and (2) replacing the last output layer with a
Gaussian process layer. On a suite of vision and language understanding
benchmarks, SNGP outperforms other single-model approaches in prediction,
calibration and out-of-domain detection. Furthermore, SNGP provides
complementary benefits to popular techniques such as deep ensembles and data
augmentation, making it a simple and scalable building block for probabilistic
deep learning. Code is open-sourced at

of robotic harvesting in natural orchard environments. Solid-state LiDAR (SSL),
a recently introduced LiDAR technique, can perceive high-resolution geometric
information of the scenes, which can be potential utilised to receive accurate
depth information. Meanwhile, the fusion of the sensory information from LiDAR
and camera can significantly enhance the sensing ability of the harvesting
robots. This work introduces a LiDAR-camera fusion-based visual sensing and
perception strategy to perform accurate fruit localisation for a harvesting
robot in the apple orchards. Two SOTA extrinsic calibration methods,
target-based and targetless-based, are applied and evaluated to obtain the
accurate extrinsic matrix between the LiDAR and camera. With the extrinsic
calibration, the point clouds and color images are fused to perform fruit
localisation using a one-stage instance segmentation network. Experimental
shows that LiDAR-camera achieves better quality on visual sensing in the
natural environments. Meanwhile, introducing the LiDAR-camera fusion largely
improves the accuracy and robustness of the fruit localisation. Specifically,
the standard deviations of fruit localisation by using LiDAR-camera at 0.5 m,
1.2 m, and 1.8 m are 0.245, 0.227, and 0.275 cm respectively. These measurement
error is only one one fifth of that from Realsense D455. Lastly, we have
attached our visualised point cloud to demonstrate the highly accurate sensing
method.

(MUD) are appealing for solving the random access problem in massive
machine-type communications (mMTC) with sporadic device activity. Such
protocols would greatly benefit from a prior deterministic knowledge of the
sparsity level, i.e., instantaneous number of simultaneously active devices
$K$. Aiming at this, herein we introduce a framework relying on coordinated
pilot transmissions (CPT) over a short phase at the beginning of the
transmission block for detecting $K$ in mMTC scenarios under Rayleigh fading.
CPT can be implemented either as: i) U-CPT, which exploits only uplink
transmissions, or A-CPT, which includes also downlink transmissions for channel
state information (CSI) acquisition that resolve fading uncertainty. We discuss
two specific implementations of A-CPT: ii) A-CPT-F, which implements CSI-based
phase corrections while leveraging the same statistical inverse power control
used by U-CPT, and iii) A-CPT-D, which implements a dynamic CSI-based inverse
power control, although it requires some active devices to remain in silence if
their corresponding channels are too faded. We derive a signal sparsity level
detector for each CPT mechanism by relaxing the original integer
detection/classification problem to an estimation problem in the continuous
real domain followed by a rounding operation. We show that the variance of the
relaxed estimator increases with $K^2$ and $K$ when operating with U-CPT and
A-CPT mechanisms, respectively. The distribution of the estimators under U-CPT,
A-CPT-F and A-CPT-D is found to follow an exponential, Gaussian, and Student's
$t-$like distribution, respectively. Analyses evince the superiority of
A-CPT-D, which is also corroborated via numerical results. We reveal several
interesting trade-offs and highlight potential research directions.

rates of LISA and the joint network. The joint network expands LISA's horizon
towards lower mass end, where the event rate is high, so we have better chance

be sensitive to interfacial coupling, where a hybridization at the

charge reservoir for weakly doping the ${\alpha}$-RuCl${_3}$ upper-layers. It
demonstrated that the weak doping effect causes a considerable decrease in the
Mott-gap within the upper-layers, suggesting that an unconventional
Mott-transition is occurring in these layers. The results show that the

  Distributed Averaging-Based Integral Approach",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frequency control plays a pivotal role in reliable power system operations.
It is conventionally performed in a hierarchical way that first rapidly
stabilizes the frequency deviations and then slowly recovers the nominal
frequency. However, as the generation mix shifts from synchronous generators to
renewable resources, power systems experience larger and faster frequency
fluctuations due to the loss of inertia, which adversely impacts the frequency
stability. This has motivated active research in algorithms that jointly
address frequency degradation and economic efficiency in a fast timescale,
among which the distributed averaging-based integral (DAI) control is a notable
one that sets controllable power injections directly proportional to the
integrals of frequency deviation and economic inefficiency signals.
Nevertheless, DAI do not typically consider the transient performance of the
system following power disturbances and has been restricted to quadratic
operational cost functions. This manuscript aims to leverage nonlinear optimal
controllers to simultaneously achieve optimal transient frequency control and
find the most economic power dispatch for frequency restoration. To this end,
we integrate reinforcement learning (RL) to the classic DAI, which results in
RL-DAI. Specifically, we use RL to learn a neural network-based control policy
mapping from the integral variables of DAI to the controllable power injections
which provides optimal transient frequency control, while DAI inherently
ensures the frequency restoration and optimal economic dispatch. Compared to
existing methods, we provide provable guarantees on the stability of the
learned controllers and extend allowable cost functions to a much larger class.
Simulations on the 39-bus New England system illustrate our results.

The
origin is a non-trivial problem to explore. We focus on the (3+1)d $\phi^4$
theory to tackle the problem due to its simplicity. The absence of other
matters helps clarify the central origin of the non-trivial vacuum. For the
analysis to remain valid in the strong-coupling regime, we adopt the method of
adaptive perturbation, which has shown accurate results for strongly coupled
quantum mechanics. We generalize this method to the scalar field theory. The
unperturbed Hamiltonian does not commute with the usual number operator.
However, the quantized scalar field admits a plane-wave expansion when acting
on the vacuum. The Lorentz symmetry is not manifest in this approach. We
propose an elegant resummation of Feynman diagrams to restore this symmetry.
The one-, two- and four-point results match numerical solutions with coupling
constant $\lambda = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16$. Finally, we find evidence for quantum
triviality, where self-consistency of the theory in the UV requires $\lambda =

raises a new concern of whether we are modeling the dataset creator's

that, indeed, instruction bias can lead to overestimation of model performance,
and that models struggle to generalize beyond biases originating in the
crowdsourcing instructions. We further analyze the influence of instruction
bias in terms of pattern frequency and model size, and derive concrete

dialog history and image content. Existing methods either consider answer
ranking and generating individually or only weakly capture the relation across

framework that jointly learns to rank and generate answers in a single model is
seldom explored. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning-based
framework UTC to unify and facilitate both discriminative and generative tasks
in visual dialog with a single model. Specifically, considering the inherent
limitation of the previous learning paradigm, we devise two inter-task
contrastive losses i.e., context contrastive loss and answer contrastive loss
to make the discriminative and generative tasks mutually reinforce each other.
These two complementary contrastive losses exploit dialog context and target
answer as anchor points to provide representation learning signals from
different perspectives. We evaluate our proposed UTC on the VisDial v1.0
dataset, where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on both
discriminative and generative tasks and surpasses previous state-of-the-art
generative methods by more than 2 absolute points on Recall@1.

laying a foundation for various tasks related to source code comprehension, and
has a very wide range of applications in the field of software engineering,
such as code clone detection, code smell classification, defects
classification, etc. The cross-language program classification can realize code
transfer in different programming languages, and can also promote
cross-language code reuse, thereby helping developers to write code quickly and
reduce the development time of code transfer. Most of the existing studies
focus on the semantic learning of the code, whilst few studies are devoted to
cross-language tasks. The main challenge of cross-language program
classification is how to extract semantic features of different programming
languages. In order to cope with this difficulty, we propose a Unified Abstract
Syntax Tree (namely UAST in this paper) neural network. In detail, the core
idea of UAST consists of two unified mechanisms. First, UAST learns an AST
representation by unifying the AST traversal sequence and graph-like AST
structure for capturing semantic code features. Second, we construct a
mechanism called unified vocabulary, which can reduce the feature gap between
different programming languages, so it can achieve the role of cross-language
program classification. Besides, we collect a dataset containing 20,000 files
of five programming languages, which can be used as a benchmark dataset for the
cross-language program classification task. We have done experiments on two
datasets, and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four evaluation metrics (Precision,
Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy).

All these are encoded explicitly in the fundamental frequencies of the orbits,

constructs a super-graph to associate a rich set of candidate features with a
group of light-weighted network blocks. Then, to diminish the model's resource

entropy-minimized objective function. This enables TinyLight to work on a
standalone microcontroller with merely 2KB RAM and 32KB ROM. We evaluate
TinyLight on multiple road networks with real-world traffic demands.

analyzing various diffractive networks designed to image through random
diffusers with different correlation lengths, a trade-off between the image
reconstruction fidelity and distortion reduction capability of the diffractive
network was observed. During its training, random diffusers with a range of
correlation lengths were used to improve the diffractive network's
generalization performance. Increasing the number of random diffusers used in
each epoch reduced the overfitting of the diffractive network's imaging
performance to known diffusers. We also demonstrated that the use of additional
diffractive layers improved the generalization capability to see through new,
random diffusers. Finally, we introduced deliberate misalignments in training
to 'vaccinate' the network against random layer-to-layer shifts that might
arise due to the imperfect assembly of the diffractive networks. These analyses
provide a comprehensive guide in designing diffractive networks to see through

which uses the differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm to
guarantee the privacy of each time series sample in the learning stage. On the

complexity, and study them through the lens of dynamic data structures. That
is, instead of asking for a static algorithm that solves the given instance

a solution, or reports a lack thereof, upon updates in the instance.
  We first consider the Closest String problem, for which we design randomized
dynamic data structures with amortized update times $d^{\mathcal{O}(d)}$ and
$|\Sigma|^{\mathcal{O}(d)}$, respectively, where $\Sigma$ is the alphabet and
$d$ is the assumed bound on the maximum distance. These are obtained by
combining known static approaches to Closest String with color-coding.
  Next, we note that from a result of Frandsen et al.~[J. ACM'97] one can
easily infer a meta-theorem that provides dynamic data structures for
parameterized string problems with worst-case update time of the form
$\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$, where $k$ is the parameter in question and $n$ is

either invest in a public project or decide not to invest. Based on the
decisions of all the players, each player receives a reward as per his/her
utility function. However, classical models of BNPG game do not consider
altruism, which players often exhibit and can significantly affect equilibrium
behavior. Yu et al. [24] extended the classical BNPG game to capture the
altruistic aspect of the players. We, in this paper, first study the problem of
deciding the existence of a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (PSNE) in a BNPG
game with altruism. This problem is already known to be NP-complete. We
complement this hardness result by showing that the problem admits efficient
algorithms when the input network is either a tree or a complete graph. We
further study the Altruistic Network Modification problem, where the task is to
compute if a target strategy profile can be made a PSNE by adding or deleting a
few edges. This problem is also known to be NP-complete. We strengthen this
hardness result by exhibiting intractability results even for trees. A perhaps
surprising finding of our work is that the above problem remains NP-hard even
for bounded degree graphs when the altruism network is undirected, but becomes
polynomial-time solvable when the altruism network is directed. We also show
some results on computing an MSNE and some parameterized complexity results. In
summary, our results show that it is much easier to predict how the players in
a BNPG game will behave compared to how the players in a BNPG game can be made
to behave in a desirable way.

given subsignatures, preserving all logical consequences that do not mention
the removed symbols; the weaker property of (Craig) interpolation allows the
projected formula -- the interpolant -- to be different for each logical
consequence of the original formula. These properties are of importance, e.g.,
in the modularization of logical theories. We study interpolation in the
context of coalgebraic modal logics, i.e. modal logics axiomatized in rank 1,
restricting for clarity to the case with finitely many modalities. Examples of
such logics include the modal logics K and KD, neighbourhood logic and its
monotone variant, finite-monoid-weighted logics, and coalition logic. We
introduce a notion of one-step (uniform) interpolation, which refers only to a
restricted logic without nesting of modalities, and show that a coalgebraic
modal logic has uniform interpolation if it has one-step interpolation.
Moreover, we identify preservation of finite surjective weak pullbacks as a
sufficient, and in the monotone case necessary, condition for one-step
interpolation. We thus prove or reprove uniform interpolation for most of the
examples listed above.

complementary information about the properties of our Universe. Unlike dense
regions, voids are avoided by matter and are less contaminated by baryonic
processes. The first step to understanding the properties of cosmic voids is to
correctly infer their mass profiles. In the literature, various techniques have
been implemented. In this paper, we review them and implement a new technique
that is based on Doppler lensing. We use a relativistic $N$-body code,
\textsc{Gevolution}, to generate cosmological mass perturbations and implement
a three-dimensional ray-tracing technique, which follows the evolution of a
ray-bundles. We focus on the various properties of cosmic voids (e.g. void size
function, 2-point correlation function, and the density profile of voids), and
compare the results with their universal trends. We show that when weak-lensing
is combined with the Doppler lensing we obtain even tighter constraints than
weak-lensing alone. We also obtain better agreement between density profiles
within central parts of voids inferred from lensing and density profiles
inferred from halo tracers. The implication of the result relevant to the
ongoing and prospective low-redshift spectroscopic surveys is briefly

implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, it is a challenge to efficiently
train SNNs due to their non-differentiability. Most existing methods either
suffer from high latency (i.e., long simulation time steps), or cannot achieve
as high performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this paper, we
propose the Differentiation on Spike Representation (DSR) method, which could
achieve high performance that is competitive to ANNs yet with low latency.
First, we encode the spike trains into spike representation using (weighted)
firing rate coding. Based on the spike representation, we systematically derive
that the spiking dynamics with common neural models can be represented as some
sub-differentiable mapping. With this viewpoint, our proposed DSR method trains
SNNs through gradients of the mapping and avoids the common
non-differentiability problem in SNN training. Then we analyze the error when
representing the specific mapping with the forward computation of the SNN. To
reduce such error, we propose to train the spike threshold in each layer, and
to introduce a new hyperparameter for the neural models. With these components,
the DSR method can achieve state-of-the-art SNN performance with low latency on
both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet,

Jerzak and Richard Johansson","Conceptualizing Treatment Leakage in Text-based Causal Inference",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Causal inference methods that control for text-based confounders are becoming
increasingly important in the social sciences and other disciplines where text
is readily available. However, these methods rely on a critical assumption that
there is no treatment leakage: that is, the text only contains information
about the confounder and no information about treatment assignment. When this
assumption does not hold, methods that control for text to adjust for
confounders face the problem of post-treatment (collider) bias. However, the
assumption that there is no treatment leakage may be unrealistic in real-world
situations involving text, as human language is rich and flexible. Language
appearing in a public policy document or health records may refer to the future
and the past simultaneously, and thereby reveal information about the treatment
assignment.
  In this article, we define the treatment-leakage problem, and discuss the
identification as well as the estimation challenges it raises. Second, we
delineate the conditions under which leakage can be addressed by removing the
treatment-related signal from the text in a pre-processing step we define as
text distillation. Lastly, using simulation, we show how treatment leakage
introduces a bias in estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) and how
text distillation can mitigate this bias.

well-defined categorical semantics as morphisms in a dagger-compact category.
Our chosen setting is suitable for infinite-dimensional diagrammatic reasoning,
generalising the ZX calculus and other algebraic gadgets familiar to the
categorical quantum theory community.
  The Feynman diagrams we define look very similar to their traditional
counterparts, but are more general: instead of depicting scattering amplitude,
they embody the linear maps from which the amplitudes themselves are computed,
for any given initial and final particle states. This shift in perspective
reflects into a formal transition from the syntactic, graph-theoretic
compositionality of traditional Feynman diagrams to a semantic,
categorical-diagrammatic compositionality.
  Because we work in a concrete categorical setting -- powered by non-standard
analysis -- we are able to take direct advantage of complex additive structure
in our description. This makes it possible to derive a particularly compelling
characterisation for the sequential composition of categorical Feynman
diagrams, which automatically results in the superposition of all possible
graph-theoretic combinations of the individual diagrams themselves.

Researchers
have resorted to soft bodies to investigate Artificial Life (ALife)-related
questions; similarly, a new era of soft-bodied robots has just begun.
Nevertheless, because of their infinite degrees of freedom, soft bodies pose
unique challenges in terms of simulation, control, and optimization. Here we
propose a novel soft-bodied agents formalism, namely Pressure-based Soft Agents
(PSAs): they are bodies of gas enveloped by a chain of springs and masses, with
pressure pushing on the masses from inside the body. Pressure endows the agents
with structure, while springs and masses simulate softness and allow the agents
to assume a large gamut of shapes. Actuation takes place by changing the length
of springs or modulating global pressure. We optimize the controller of PSAs
for a locomotion task on hilly terrain and an escape task from a cage; the
latter is particularly suitable for soft-bodied agents, as it requires the
agent to contort itself to squeeze through a small aperture. Our results
suggest that PSAs are indeed effective at those tasks and that controlling
pressure is fundamental for shape-changing. Looking forward, we envision PSAs
to play a role in the modeling of soft-bodied agents, including soft robots and
biological cells. Videos of evolved agents are available at

that the non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis of the net-proton number

the Guaran\'i peoples of the Province of Paraquaria (Province of Paraguay) has
only been recently considered, with the existing studies focusing primarily on
the orientation of their churches. The paper presented here, which is the first
archaeoastronomical study of the Jesuit missions of Chiquitos in eastern
Bolivia, is an attempt to continue and complement the previous
archaeoastronomical studies of the region. The methodologies employed involved
the analysis of the Jesuit churches that currently exist in this region,
namely, the on-site measurements of the orientations of eight churches
currently standing and the ruins of a ninth church of which only a
free-standing bell tower and parts of the side walls remain preserved. The
orientation measurements of a tenth church, which we were unable to visit, were
determined via the use of satellite maps. The landscape surrounding these
churches was then examined in detail and furthermore, a detailed cultural and
historical study of the characteristics of the villages where the churches are
located was carried out. Our results show that, unlike the churches of the
Province of Paraquaria where meridian orientations in the north-south direction
stand out, half of the studied churches have shown potential canonical
orientations that seem to be aligned to solar phenomena, with three exhibiting
precise equinoctial orientation. We propose reasons for these orientations,
including the possible relevance of illumination effects on significant
internal elements within the churches - effects that were generally sought in
Baroque church architecture.

cause unfairness against specific subgroups, which is an undesired phenomenon
for trustworthy ML models. In this research, we address the question to which
extent bias occurs in medical FL and how to prevent excessive bias through
reward systems. We first evaluate how to measure the contributions of
institutions toward predictive performance and bias in cross-silo medical FL
with a Shapley value approximation method. In a second step, we design
different reward systems incentivizing contributions toward high predictive
performance or low bias. We then propose a combined reward system that
incentivizes contributions toward both. We evaluate our work using multiple
medical chest X-ray datasets focusing on patient subgroups defined by patient
sex and age. Our results show that we can successfully measure contributions
toward bias, and an integrated reward system successfully incentivizes
contributions toward a well-performing model with low bias. While the
partitioning of scans only slightly influences the overall bias, institutions
with data predominantly from one subgroup introduce a favorable bias for this
subgroup. Our results indicate that reward systems, which focus on predictive
performance only, can transfer model bias against patients to an institutional
level. Our work helps researchers and practitioners design reward systems for

two-phase compressible flow model, coupled with the phase transition procedure,
is used to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of wave structures and
cavitation behaviours, including the inception, growth and collapse of
cavitation. The ray analysis method is appended to the interaction, and the
evolution of wave structures are characterized by the motion of a series of
rays, whose emission angle is correlated to a dimensionless wave speed, the
ratio of the transmitted shock velocity and incident shock velocity. Under the
influence of cylindrical droplet curvature, those rays focus inside the
droplet. The present study theoretically predicts the focusing position for the
first time, determined by the dimensionless wave speed, and the theoretical
analysis is well consistent with numerical results. Due to the significant
difference in the properties between the upper and lower branches of the second
reflected wave, a high-transient pressure region is observed and its position
is clarified. Numerical results show that if the incident shock wave intensity
is high enough, the focusing zone of the reflected expansion wave can be
identified as a cavity inside the droplet. Furthermore, the cavitation zone is
enlarged, and the stronger collapsing waves are induced by increasing the

relating to a problem similar to consecutive ones proven to be hard in the

from which many important results follow. On the other hand, we show that the
classical Debord-McGarvey theorem can still be proven two-crossing, implying
that any weighted majority tournament is inducible by a two-crossing election.
This shows that many voting rules are NP-hard under two-crossing elections,
including Kemeny and Slater. This is in contrast to the single-crossing case
and outlines an important complexity boundary between single- and two-crossing.
Subsequently, we show that for two-crossing elections the Young scores of all
candidates can be computed in polynomial time, by formulating a totally
unimodular linear program. Finally, we consider the Chamberlin-Courant rule

entities expressed across multiple sentences, which can be viewed as a
multi-label classification problem. In a typical document, most entity pairs do
not express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as ""none"" or ""no

such none class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined classes
(relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the probability of
pre-defined relations independently without considering the probability of ""no

between the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal
predictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that
encourages large margins of label confidence scores between each pre-defined
class and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and
context-dependent thresholding for label prediction. To gain further robustness
against positive-negative imbalance and mislabeled data that could appear in
real-world RE datasets, we propose a margin regularization and a margin
shifting technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing multi-label losses for document-level RE and
works well in other multi-label tasks such as emotion classification when none

biproducts (of abelian groups) and to semidirect products (of groups) for
exploring a wide class of monoid extensions. More generally, abstract
semibiproducts exist in any concrete category over sets in which map addition
is meaningful thus reinterpreting Mac Lane's relative biproducts. In the
pointed case they give rise to a special class of extensions called
semibiproduct extensions. Not all monoid extensions are semibiproduct
extensions but all group extensions are. A categorical equivalence is
established between the category of pointed semibiproducts of monoids and the
category of pointed monoid action systems, a new category of actions that
emerges from the equivalence. The main difference to classical extension theory
is that semibiproduct extensions are treated in the same way as split
extensions, even though the section map may fail to be a homomorphism. A list
with all the 14 semibiproduct extensions of 2-element monoids is provided.

distribution for a metasurface aperture needed to form a desired radiation
pattern. A metasurface aperture consists of an array of subwavelength
metamaterial elements, each of which can be conceptualized as a radiating,
polarizable dipole. An ideal polarizability distribution can be determined by
using a holographic approach to first obtain the necessary aperture fields,
which can then be converted to a polarizability distribution using equivalence
principles. To achieve this ideal distribution, the polarizability of each
element would need to have unconstrained magnitude and phase; however, for a
single, passive, metamaterial resonator the magnitude and phase of the
effective polarizability are inextricably linked through the properties of the
Lorentzian resonance, with the range of phase values restricted to a span of at
most 180 degrees. Here, we introduce a family of mappings from the ideal to the
available polarizability distributions, easily visualized by plotting both
polarizabilities in the complex plane. Using one of these mappings it is
possible to achieve highly optimized beam patterns from a metasurface antenna,
despite the inherent resonator limitations. We introduce the mapping technique
and provide several specific examples, with numerical simulations used to
confirm the design approach.

(EHR) from the National COVID Cohort Collaborate (N3C). Materials and Methods:
The EHR are normalized by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)
Clinical Data Model (CDM). EHR phenotyping resulted in 270,897 pregnant women
(2018-06-01 to 2021-05-31). We developed a rule-based algorithm and performed a
multi-level evaluation to test content validity and clinical validity of the
algorithm; and extreme value analysis for individuals with <150 or >300 days of
gestation. Results: The algorithm identified 296,194 pregnancies (16,659
COVID-19 174 and 744 without COVID-19 peri-pandemic) in 270,897 pregnant women.
For inferring gestational age, 95% cases (n=40) have moderate-high accuracy
(Cohen Kappa = 0.62); 100% cases (n=40) have moderate-high granularity of
temporal information (Cohen Kappa = 1). For inferring delivery dates, the
accuracy is 100% (Cohen Kappa = 1). Accuracy of gestational age detection for
extreme length of gestation is 93.3% (Cohen Kappa = 1). Mothers with COVID-19
showed higher prevalence in obesity (35.1% vs. 29.5%), diabetes (17.8% vs.
17.0%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (0.2% vs. 0.1%),
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1.8% vs. 0.2%). Discussion: We explored
the characteristics of pregnant women by different timing of COVID-19 with our
algorithm: the first to infer temporal information from complete antenatal care
and detect the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection for pregnant women using N3C.
Conclusion: The algorithm shows excellent validity in inferring gestational age

greatest benefit to humankind in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Economics,
Literature, and Peace, and is considered by many to be the most prestigious
recognition for one's body of work. Receiving a Nobel prize confers a sense of
financial independence and significant prestige, vaulting its recipients to
global prominence. Apart from the prize money (approximately US$1,145,000), a
Nobel laureate can expect to benefit in a number of ways, including increased
success in securing grants, wider adoption and promulgation of one's theories
and ideas, increased professional and academic opportunities, and, in some
cases, a measure of celebrity. A Nobel laureate's affiliated institution, by
extension, also greatly benefits. Because of this, many institutions seek to
employ Nobel Prize winners or individuals who have a high likelihood of winning
one in the future. Many of the recent discoveries and innovations recognized
with a Nobel Prize were made possible only because of advanced computing
capabilities. Understanding the ways in which advanced research computing
facilities and services are essential in enabling new and important discoveries
cannot be overlooked in examining the value of a Nobel Prize. This paper
explores an institution's benefits of having a Nobel Prize winner among its
ranks.

comprehensive treatment of their mergence in the context of dagger categories
and their generalizations. Our key insight is to approach associativity as a
confluence property of hypergraph rewrite systems. This approach allows us to
define a notion of ternary category and heapoid, where morphisms bind three
objects simultaneously, and suggests a systematic study of higher arity forms
of associativity.

tasks, deep artificial neural networks are sensitive to input noises,
particularly adversarial perturbations. On the contrary, human and animal
brains are much less vulnerable. In contrast to the one-shot inference
performed by most deep neural networks, the brain often solves decision-making
with an evidence accumulation mechanism that may trade time for accuracy when
facing noisy inputs. The mechanism is well described by the Drift-Diffusion
Model (DDM). In the DDM, decision-making is modeled as a process in which noisy
evidence is accumulated toward a threshold. Drawing inspiration from the DDM,
we propose the Dropout-based Drift-Diffusion Model (DDDM) that combines
test-phase dropout and the DDM for improving the robustness for arbitrary
neural networks. The dropouts create temporally uncorrelated noises in the
network that counter perturbations, while the evidence accumulation mechanism
guarantees a reasonable decision accuracy. Neural networks enhanced with the
DDDM tested in image, speech, and text classification tasks all significantly
outperform their native counterparts, demonstrating the DDDM as a task-agnostic
defense against adversarial attacks.

  in Harsh Urban Environments","Submitted to AIJ Special Issue on Risk-Aware Autonomous Systems:
  Theory and Practice",,,,"cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Risk-aware urban localization with the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) remains an unsolved problem with frequent misdetection of the user's
street or side of the street. Significant advances in 3D map-aided GNSS use
grid-based GNSS shadow matching alongside AI-driven line-of-sight (LOS)
classifiers and server-based processing to improve localization accuracy,
especially in the cross-street direction. Our prior work introduces a new
paradigm for shadow matching that proposes set-valued localization with
computationally efficient zonotope set representations. While existing
literature improved accuracy and efficiency, the current state of shadow
matching theory does not address the needs of risk-aware autonomous systems. We
extend our prior work to propose Mosaic Zonotope Shadow Matching (MZSM) that
employs a classifier-agnostic polytope mosaic architecture to provide
risk-awareness and certifiable guarantees on urban positioning. We formulate a
recursively expanding binary tree that refines an initial location estimate
with set operations into smaller polytopes. Together, the smaller polytopes
form a mosaic. We weight the tree branches with the probability that the user
is in line of sight of the satellite and expand the tree with each new
satellite observation. Our method yields an exact shadow matching distribution
from which we guarantee uncertainty bounds on the user localization. We perform
high-fidelity simulations using a 3D building map of San Francisco to validate
our algorithm's risk-aware improvements. We demonstrate that MZSM provides
certifiable guarantees across varied data-driven LOS classifier accuracies and
yields a more precise understanding of the uncertainty over existing methods.
We validate that our tree-based construction is efficient and tractable,
computing a mosaic from 14 satellites in 0.63 seconds and growing quadratically
in the satellite number.
