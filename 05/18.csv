required. Consent management can be implemented using speaker recognition.
Users that do not give consent enrol their voice and all their further
recordings are discarded. Building speaker recognition-based consent management
is challenging as dynamic registration, removal, and re-registration of
speakers must be efficiently handled. This work proposes a consent management
system addressing the aforementioned challenges. A contrastive based training
is applied to learn the underlying speaker equivariance inductive bias. The
contrastive features for buckets of speakers are trained a few steps into each
iteration and act as replay buffers. These features are progressively selected
using a multi-strided random sampler for classification. Moreover, new methods
for dynamic registration using a portion of old utterances, removal, and
re-registration of speakers are proposed. The results verify memory efficiency
and dynamic capabilities of the proposed methods and outperform the existing
approach from the literature.

model to describe the nonlinear dynamics of actively Q-switched lasers and
random perturbations due to amplified spontaneous emission. This model will
serve as a basis for the design of (nonlinear) control and estimation
strategies and thus a high value is set on its computational efficiency.
Therefore, a common traveling-wave model is chosen as a starting point and a
number of model-order reduction steps are performed. As a result, a set of
nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the dynamic behavior of the laser
during a switching cycle is obtained. A semi-analytic solution of these
differential equations yields expressions for the population inversion after a
switching cycle and for the output energy, which are then used to formulate a
nonlinear discrete-time model for the pulse-to-pulse dynamics. Simulation
studies including models with different levels of complexity and first
experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in medical applications. Typical B-mode
US images have limited resolution and contrast and weak physical
interpretation. Inverse US methods were developed to reconstruct the media's
speed-of-sound (SoS) based on a linear acoustic model. However, the wave
propagation in medical US is governed by nonlinear acoustics, which introduces
more complex behaviors neglected in the linear model. In this work we propose a
nonlinear waveform inversion (NWI) approach for quantitative US, that considers
a nonlinear acoustics model to simultaneously reconstruct multiple material
properties, including the medium's SoS, density, attenuation, and nonlinearity
parameter. We thus broaden current inverse US approaches, such as the full
waveform inversion (FWI) algorithm, by considering nonlinear media, and
additional physical parameters. We represent the nonlinear acoustic model by
means of a recurrent neural network, which enables us to apply advanced
optimization algorithms borrowed from the deep learning toolbox and achieve
more efficient reconstructions compared to the FWI method. We evaluate the
performance of our approach on in-silico data and show that neglecting
nonlinear effects may result in substantial degradation in the reconstruction,
paving the way of NWI into clinical applications.

vehicles (EVs) has grown exponentially. An EV has two major components, which
make it different from traditional vehicles, first is its environment friendly
nature because of being electric, and second is the interconnection ability of
these vehicles because of modern information and communication technologies
(ICTs). Both of these features are playing a key role in the development of
EVs, and both academia and industry personals are working towards development
of modern protocols for EV networks. All these interactions, whether from
energy perspective or from communication perspective, both are generating a
tremendous amount of data every day. In order to get most out of this data
collected from EVs, research works have highlighted the use of machine/deep
learning techniques for various EV applications. This interaction is quite
fruitful, but it also comes with a critical concern of privacy leakage during
collection, storage, and training of vehicular data. Therefore, alongside
developing machine/deep learning techniques for EVs, it is also critical to
ensure that they are resilient to private information leakage and attacks. In
this paper, we begin with the discussion about essential background on EVs and
privacy preservation techniques, followed by a brief overview of privacy
preservation in EVs using machine learning techniques. Particularly, we also
focus on an in-depth review of the integration of privacy techniques in EVs and
highlighted different application scenarios in EVs. Alongside this, we provide
a a very detailed survey of current works on privacy preserving machine/deep
learning techniques used for modern EVs. Finally, we present the certain
research issues, critical challenges, and future directions of research for
researchers working in privacy preservation in EVs.

quantum systems, resulting from fluctuations of its density in space, may
induce a quantum collapse mechanism \cite{Penrose-1996}, but he did not propose
a precise dynamics for this process. We use the GBC (Gravitational Bohmian
Collapse) model \cite{GBC}, which provides such a dynamics. The effects of
collapse in dilute quantum systems are investigated, both in ordinary 3D space
and in configuration space.
  We first discuss how a single result appears during a quantum measurement.
The GBC model predicts a continuous but very fast evolution of the state vector
that, at the end of the measurement, reproduces the von Neumann projection
postulate. This ensures that the model remains compatible with the relativistic
nosignaling constraint. In the absence of any measurement, we study the
spontaneous effects of the GBC process, which depend on the quantum correlation
function of observables with the spatial density operator. If the selected
observable is the local current of the density fluid, we show that the collapse
term leads to modifications of the Newton force, in a scalar or tensor form.

on the mean squared (projected) Bellman error. However, squared errors are
known to be sensitive to outliers, both skewing the solution of the objective
and resulting in high-magnitude and high-variance gradients. To control these
high-magnitude updates, typical strategies in RL involve clipping gradients,
clipping rewards, rescaling rewards, or clipping errors. While these strategies
appear to be related to robust losses -- like the Huber loss -- they are built
on semi-gradient update rules which do not minimize a known loss. In this work,
we build on recent insights reformulating squared Bellman errors as a
saddlepoint optimization problem and propose a saddlepoint reformulation for a
Huber Bellman error and Absolute Bellman error. We start from a formalization
of robust losses, then derive sound gradient-based approaches to minimize these
losses in both the online off-policy prediction and control settings. We
characterize the solutions of the robust losses, providing insight into the
problem settings where the robust losses define notably better solutions than
the mean squared Bellman error. Finally, we show that the resulting
gradient-based algorithms are more stable, for both prediction and control,
with less sensitivity to meta-parameters.

entangled states - a type of resources that have a limited lifetime and need to
be regenerated after consumption. In a nutshell, quantum routing algorithms
have to use these resources efficiently, while optimizing some objectives such
as the total waiting time. Current routing algorithms tend to keep a routing
request waiting until all of the resources on its path are available. In this
paper, we introduce a new way of managing entanglement resources in an
opportunistic fashion: a request can move forward along its path as soon as
possible (even if some resources on its path are not ready). We show that this
opportunistic approach is fundamentally better than conventional approaches. In
particular, our results indicate that this new approach achieves a 30-50%
improvement in the average total waiting time and average link waiting time
compared with several state-of-the-art routing algorithms. As a by-product of
this work, we develop a new simulator for quantum routing, which can be used to
evaluate various design choices under different scenarios.

and goals in a single search space. They are designed to do so efficiently by
reusing information across planning queries. This information may be computed
before or during the search and often includes knowledge of valid paths. Using
known valid paths to solve an individual planning query takes less
computational effort than finding a completely new solution. This allows
multiquery algorithms, such as PRM*, to outperform single-query algorithms,
such as RRT*, on many problems but their relative performance depends on how
much information is reused. Despite this, few multiquery planners explicitly
seek to maximize path reuse and, as a result, many do not consistently
outperform single-query alternatives. This paper presents Effort Informed
Roadmaps (EIRM*), an almost-surely asymptotically optimal multiquery planning
algorithm that explicitly prioritizes reusing computational effort. EIRM* uses
an asymmetric bidirectional search to identify existing paths that may help
solve an individual planning query and then uses this information to order its
search and reduce computational effort. This allows it to find initial
solutions up to an order-of-magnitude faster than state-of-the-art planning
algorithms on the tested abstract and robotic multiquery planning problems.

waveguides made of low-autofluorescing SiN with intrinsic quantum emitters and
demonstrate the single-photon emission coupling into the waveguide mode. The
observed emission coupling from these emitters is found to be in line with
numerical simulations. The coupling of the single-photon emission to a
waveguide mode is confirmed by second-order autocorrelation measurements of
light outcoupled off the photonic chip by grating couplers. Fitting the
second-order autocorrelation histogram yields $g^{(2)}(0)=0.35\pm0.12$ without
spectral filtering or background correction with an outcoupled photon rate of
$10^4$ counts per second. This demonstrates the first successful coupling of
photons from intrinsic single-photon emitters in SiN to monolithically

the distribution form of $W(L,t)$ approaches to TW-GSE, and when $\rho > 0.20$,
the distribution becomes more asymmetric, leptokurtic, and fat-tailed, and
tends to an unknown form, which is similar to Gumbel distribution.

modeled as a gas of hard spheres with inelastic collisions. At moderate
densities, a fundamental basis for the determination of the granular
hydrodynamics is provided by the Enskog kinetic equation conveniently adapted
to account for inelastic collisions. A surprising result (compared to its
molecular gas counterpart) for granular mixtures is the failure of the energy
equipartition, even in homogeneous states. This means that the partial
temperatures $T_i$ (measuring the mean kinetic energy of each species) are
different to the (total) granular temperature $T$. The goal of this paper is to
provide an overview on the effect of different partial temperatures on the
transport properties of the mixture. Our analysis addresses first the impact of
energy nonequipartition on transport which is only due to the inelastic
character of collisions. This effect (which is absent for elastic collisions)
is shown to be significant in important problems in granular mixtures such as
thermal diffusion segregation. Then, an independent source of energy
nonequipartition due to the existence of a divergence of the flow velocity is
studied. This effect (which was already analyzed in several pioneering works on
dense hard-sphere molecular mixtures) affects to the bulk viscosity
coefficient. Analytical (approximate) results are compared against Monte Carlo
and molecular dynamics simulations, showing the reliability of kinetic theory
for describing granular flows.

demonstrating current-induced magnetization reversal showing a significant

sequences with bounded entries. These structured instances of
Min-Plus-Convolution can be solved in time $O(n^{1.5})$ [Chi,Duan,Xie,Zhang

We also
know that the different jet sources may be binary in nature, which may lead to
a regular, periodic motion of the jet nozzle, an orbital motion or precession.
Here, we present the results of 2D (M)HD simulations in order to investigate
how a precessing or orbiting jet nozzle affects the propagation of a high-speed
jet. We have performed a parameter study of systems with different precession
angles, orbital periods or separations, and different magnetic field strengths.
We find that these kinds of nozzles lead to curved jet propagation which is
determined by the main parameters that define the jet nozzle. We find C-shaped
jets from orbiting nozzles and S-shaped jets from precessing nozzles. Over long
time and long distances, the initially curved jet motion bores a broad channel
into the ambient gas that is filled with high-speed jet material which lateral
motion is damped, however. A strong (longitudinal) magnetic field can damp the
jet curvature that is enforced by either precession of orbital motion of the
jet sources. We have investigated the force balance across the jet and ambient
medium and found that the lateral magnetic pressure and gas pressure gradients
are almost balanced, but that a lack of gas pressure on the concave side of the
curvature is leading to the lateral motion. Magnetic tension does not play a
significant role. Our results are obtained in code units, but we provide
scaling relations such that our results may be applied to young stars,
micro-quasars, symbiotic stars or AGN.

prominence as candidates for both near and long-term applications. These
devices are particularly well suited to solve independent set problems, as the
combinatorial constraints can be naturally encoded in the low-energy Hilbert
space due to the Rydberg blockade mechanism. Here, we approach this connection
with a focus on a particular device architecture and explore the ubiquity and
utility of independent set problems by providing examples of real-world
applications. After a pedagogical introduction of basic graph theory concepts
of relevance, we briefly discuss how to encode independent set problems in
Rydberg Hamiltonians. We then outline the major classes of independent set
problems and include associated example applications with industry and social
relevance. We determine a wide range of sectors that could benefit from
efficient solutions of independent set problems -- from telecommunications and
logistics to finance and strategic planning -- and display some general
strategies for efficient problem encoding and implementation on neutral-atom
platforms.

and commercial endeavors ranging from edge computing and sensing to large-scale
signal processing in data centers. The most efficient and well-entrenched
method to train such networks is backpropagation, or reverse-mode automatic
differentiation. To counter an exponentially increasing energy budget in the
artificial intelligence sector, there has been recent interest in analog
implementations of neural networks, specifically nanophotonic neural networks
for which no analog backpropagation demonstration exists. We design
mass-manufacturable silicon photonic neural networks that alternately cascade
our custom designed ""photonic mesh"" accelerator with digitally implemented
nonlinearities. These reconfigurable photonic meshes program computationally
intensive arbitrary matrix multiplication by setting physical voltages that
tune the interference of optically encoded input data propagating through
integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks. Here, using our packaged
photonic chip, we demonstrate in situ backpropagation for the first time to
solve classification tasks and evaluate a new protocol to keep the entire
gradient measurement and update of physical device voltages in the analog
domain, improving on past theoretical proposals. Our method is made possible by
introducing three changes to typical photonic meshes: (1) measurements at
optical ""grating tap"" monitors, (2) bidirectional optical signal propagation
automated by fiber switch, and (3) universal generation and readout of optical
amplitude and phase. After training, our classification achieves accuracies
similar to digital equivalents even in presence of systematic error. Our
findings suggest a new training paradigm for photonics-accelerated artificial
intelligence based entirely on a physical analog of the popular backpropagation
technique.

a data gathering system, where IEC-61850 messages are transmitted from and
between different elements in a microgrid system, such as IED, publishers, and

standard IEC-61850 defines many protocols, such as SV, GOOSE, and MMS, each of
them with a variety of requirements and sharing similar transport communication
protocols, such as TCP and UDP. Hence, a testing framework is used in the test

connectivity, while enabling fast dissemination of information, also enables
fast dissipation of adversarial inputs.

functions that promise similar security guarantees as Bitcoin are susceptible
to systematic error, so multiple devices may not reach a consensus on

more general family of robust discrete analog cryptographic hash functions,

photonic mesh networks of interferometers. The difficulty of LightHash can be
adjusted to be sufficiently tolerant to systematic error (calibration error,
loss error, coupling error, and phase error) and preserve inherent security
guarantees present in the Bitcoin protocol. Finally, going beyond our
proof-of-concept, we define a ``photonic advantage'' criterion and justify how
recent developments in CMOS optoelectronics (including analog-digital

method FILM for federated learning of language models (LMs). For the first
time, we show the feasibility of recovering text from large batch sizes of up

from gradients and then directly reconstructs sentences based on beam search
and a prior-based reordering strategy. We conduct the FILM attack on several
large-scale datasets and show that it can successfully reconstruct single
sentences with high fidelity for large batch sizes and even multiple sentences
if applied iteratively. We evaluate three defense methods: gradient pruning,
DPSGD, and a simple approach to freeze word embeddings that we propose. We show
that both gradient pruning and DPSGD lead to a significant drop in utility.
However, if we fine-tune a public pre-trained LM on private text without
updating word embeddings, it can effectively defend the attack with minimal
data utility loss. Together, we hope that our results can encourage the
community to rethink the privacy concerns of LM training and its standard
practices in the future.

on EMRIs. We model the inspiral as taking place in the field of a Schwarzschild
black hole perturbed by the gravitational field of a far axisymmetric
distribution of mass enclosing the system. We take into account the redshift,
frame-dragging, and quadrupolar tide caused by the enclosing matter, thus
incorporating all effects to inverse third order of the characteristic distance
of the enclosing mass. Then, we use canonical perturbation theory to obtain the
action-angle coordinates and Hamiltonian for mildly eccentric precessing
test-particle orbits in this background. Finally, we use this to efficiently
compute mildly eccentric inspirals in this field and document their properties.

Problem of Lattice QCD. Due to the difficulty in calculating the higher order
Taylor coefficients, various alternative expansion schemes as well as
resummation techniques have been suggested to extend the Taylor series to
larger values of $\mu_B$. Recently, a way to resum the contribution of the

correlation functions are calculated stochastically, the exponential factor
contains a bias which can be significant for large $N$ and $\mu_B$. In this
paper, we present a new method to calculate the QCD equation of state based on
the well-known cumulant expansion from statistics. By truncating the expansion
at a maximum order $M$, we end up with only finite products of the correlation
functions which can be evaluated in an unbiased manner. Although our formalism
is also applicable for $\mu_B\ne0$, here we present it for the simpler case of
a finite isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$ for which there is no Sign Problem.
We present and compare results for the pressure and the isospin density
obtained using Taylor expansion, exponential resummation and cumulant
expansion, and provide evidence that the absence of bias in the latter actually

contending with packet loss. Streaming codes are a class of codes best suited
for this setting. A key challenge for streaming codes is that they operate in
an ""online"" setting in which the amount of data to be transmitted varies over
time and is not known in advance. Mitigating the adverse effects of variability
requires spreading the data that arrives at a time slot over multiple future
packets, and the optimal strategy for spreading depends on the arrival pattern.
Algebraic coding techniques alone are therefore insufficient for designing
rate-optimal codes. We combine algebraic coding techniques with a
learning-augmented algorithm for spreading to design the first approximately
rate-optimal streaming codes for a range of parameter regimes that are
important for practical applications.

enigmatic hydrogen emission lines from T Tauri stars. This work compares
optical and near-IR spectroscopy of 29 T Tauri stars with our grid of synthetic
line profiles. The archival spectra, obtained with VLT's X-Shooter, provide
simultaneous coverage of many optical and infrared hydrogen lines. The
observations exhibit similar morphologies of line profiles seen in other
studies. We used the radiative transfer code TORUS to create synthetic
H$\alpha$, Pa$\beta$, Pa$\gamma$, and Br$\gamma$ emission lines for a fiducial
T Tauri model that included axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion and a polar
stellar wind. The distribution of Reipurth types and line widths for the
synthetic H$\alpha$ lines is similar to the observed results. However, the
modelled infrared lines are narrower than the observations by $\approx 80{~\rm
kms}^{-1}$, and our models predict a significantly higher proportion ($\approx
90$ per cent) of inverse P-Cygni profiles. Furthermore, our radiative transfer
models suggest that the frequency of P-Cygni profiles depends on the ratio of
the mass loss to mass accretion rates and blue-shifted sub-continuum absorption
was predicted for mass loss rates as low as $10^{-12}~M_{\odot}{\rm~ yr}^{-1}$.
We explore the effect of rotation, turbulence, and the contributions from
red-shifted absorption in an attempt to explain the discrepancy in widths. Our
findings show that, singularly, none of these effects is sufficient to explain
the observed disparity. However, a combination of rotation, turbulence, and
non-axisymmetric accretion may improve the fit of the models to the observed

Constraints are written (typically manually) to bias random tests towards

progresses, most constrained random tests yield little to no effect on
functional coverage. If stimuli generation consumes significantly less
resources than simulation, then a better approach involves randomly generating
a large number of tests, selecting the most effective subset, and only
simulating that subset. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for
automatic constraint extraction and test selection. This method, which we call
coverage-directed test selection, is based on supervised learning from coverage
feedback. Our method biases selection towards tests that have a high
probability of increasing functional coverage, and prioritises them for
simulation. We show how coverage-directed test selection can reduce manual

present Flash Freezing Flash Boys (F3B), a blockchain architecture that
addresses front-running attacks by using threshold cryptography. In F3B, a user
generates a symmetric key to encrypt their transaction, and once the underlying
consensus layer has committed the transaction, a decentralized
secret-management committee reveals this key. F3B mitigates front-running
attacks because, before the consensus group commits it, an adversary can no
longer read the content of a transaction, thus preventing the adversary from
benefiting from advanced knowledge of pending transactions. Unlike other
threshold-based approaches, where users encrypt their transactions with a key
derived from a future block, F3B enables users to generate a unique key for
each transaction. This feature ensures that all uncommitted transactions remain
private, even if they are delayed. Furthermore, F3B addresses front-running at
the execution layer; thus, our solution is agnostic to the underlying consensus
algorithm and compatible with existing smart contracts. We evaluated F3B based
on Ethereum, demonstrating a 0.05% transaction latency overhead with a
secret-management committee of 128 members, thus indicating our solution is

However, for Implanted devices, EM fields incur high amount of absorption in
the tissue, while alternative modes of transmission including ultrasound,
optical and magneto-electric methods result in large amount of transduction
losses due to conversion of one form of energy to another, thereby increasing
the overall end-to-end energy loss. To solve the challenge of powering and
communication in a brain implant with low end-end channel loss, we present
Bi-Phasic Quasistatic Brain Communication (BP-QBC), achieving < 60dB worst-case
end-to-end channel loss at a channel length of 55mm, by avoiding the
transduction losses during field-modality conversion. BP-QBC utilizes dipole
coupling based signal transmission within the brain tissue using differential
excitation in the transmitter and differential signal pick-up at the receiver,
and offers 41X lower power w.r.t. traditional Galvanic Human Body Communication
at a carrier frequency of 1MHz, by blocking any DC current paths through the
brain tissue. Since the electrical signal transfer through the human tissue is
electro-quasistatic up to several 10's of MHz range, BP-QBC allows a scalable
(bps-10Mbps) duty-cycled uplink from the implant to an external wearable. The
power consumption in the BP-QBC TX is only 0.52uW at 1Mbps (with 1% duty
cycling), which is within the range of harvested body-coupled power in the
downlink from an external wearable to the brain implant. Furthermore, BP-QBC
eliminates the need for sub-cranial repeaters, as it utilizes quasi-static
electrical signals, thereby avoiding any transduction losses. Such low
end-to-end channel loss with high data rates would find applications in
neuroscience, brain-machine interfaces, electroceuticals and connected
healthcare.

relevant timescales from only local two-body interactions and one-body terms in
two spatial dimensions. The scheme enables the experimental study of a variety
of models, including $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories coupled to
different types of dynamical matter and quantum dimer models on the honeycomb
lattice, for which we derive effective Hamiltonians. We discuss ground-state
phase diagrams of the experimentally most relevant effective $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theories with dynamical matter featuring various confined and
deconfined, quantum spin liquid phases. Further, we present selected probes
with immediate experimental relevance, including signatures of disorder-free
localization and a thermal deconfinement transition of two charges.

we study the evolution of gradients in galaxy assembly over a wide range in
redshift ($0.5<z<1.7$). Our $z\sim0.5$ measurements come from deep Hubble Space
Telescope WFC3 G102 grism spectroscopy obtained as part of the CANDELS
Lyman-alpha Emission at Reionization (CLEAR) Experiment. For star-forming
galaxies with Log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})\geqslant8.96$, the mean H-alpha
effective radius is $1.2\pm0.1$ times larger than that of the stellar
continuum, implying inside-out growth via star formation. This measurement
agrees within $1\sigma$ with those measured at $z\sim1$ and $z\sim1.7$ from the
3D-HST and KMOS-3D surveys respectively, implying no redshift evolution.
However, we observe redshift evolution in the stellar mass surface density
within 1 kiloparsec ($\Sigma_\mathrm{1kpc}$). Star-forming galaxies at
$z\sim0.5$ with a stellar mass of Log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})=9.5$ have a
ratio of $\Sigma_\mathrm{1kpc}$ in H-alpha relative to their stellar continuum
that is lower by $(19\pm2)\%$ compared to $z\sim1$ galaxies.
$\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$/$\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,Cont}}$ decreases
towards higher stellar masses. The majority of the redshift evolution in
$\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,H}\alpha}$/$\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,Cont}}$ versus stellar
mass stems from the fact that Log($\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$) declines
twice as much as Log($\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, Cont}}$) from $z\sim 1$ to 0.5 (at
a fixed stellar mass of Log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})=9.5$). By comparing our
results to the TNG50 cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation, we rule
out dust as the driver of this evolution. Our results are consistent with
inside-out quenching following in the wake of inside-out growth, the former of
which drives the significant drop in $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$ from
$z\sim1$ to $z\sim0.5$.

waves has uncovered unexpected features in the intrinsic properties of black
holes in the universe. One particularly surprising and exciting result is the
possible existence of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap,
$\sim50-120~M_\odot$. Dense stellar environments can populate this region of
mass space through hierarchical mergers, with the retention efficiency of black
hole merger products strongly dependent on the escape velocity of the host

potentially incompatible with the empirical mass spectrum from the current

algorithm has access to the signal before the hotword, which is referred to as
the noise context. First is the Context Aware Beamformer which uses the noise
context and detected hotword to determine how to target the desired speaker.
The second is an adaptive noise cancellation algorithm called Speech Cleaner
which trains a filter using the noise context. It is demonstrated that the two
algorithms are complementary in the signal-to-noise ratio conditions under

cut on FUV-NUV>-0.53, yielding 74 hot-WD candidates. We analysed their spectral
energy distribution (SED) by developing a fitting program for single- and
two-body SED using an MCMC algorithm; 41 are probably binary systems (a binary
fraction of ~55% was estimated). Additionally, we classified the WD star
candidates using different infrared (IR) colours available for our sample
obtaining similar results as in the SED analysis for the single and binary
systems. This supports the strength of the fitting method and the advantages of
the combination of GALEX UV with optical photometry. Ground-based time-series
photometry and spectra are required in order to confirm the nature of the WD
star candidates.

observed that the occultation depth of this Super-Earth, with a mass of
8$M_{\bigoplus}$ and radius of 2$R_{\bigoplus}$, changes significantly over
time at mid-infrared wavelengths. Observations with Spitzer measured a change
in its day-side brightness temperature of 1200 K, possibly driven by volcanic

detrend the data and fit a transit and occultation model for each sector in a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine. In a later stage we use the Leave-One-Out
Cross-Validation statistic to compare with a model of constant occultation for
the complete set and a model with no occultation. We report an occultation
depth of 8$\pm$2.5 ppm for the complete set of TESS observations. In
particular, we measured a depth of 15$\pm$4 ppm for sector 21, while for sector
44 we detect no occultation. In sector 46 we measure a weak occultation of
8$\pm$5 ppm. The occultation depth varies from one sector to the next between
1.6 and 3.4 $\sigma$ significance. We derive the possible contribution on
reflected light and thermal emission, setting an upper limit on the geometric
albedo. Based on our model comparison the presence of an occultation is
favoured considerably over no occultation, where the model with varying
occultation across sectors takes most of the statistical weight. Our analysis
confirms a detection of the occultation in TESS. Moreover, our results weakly

Practical sources of entangled qubits are imperfect, producing mixed quantum

goal is to enhance the fidelity of entangled qubits through local operations
and classical communication (LOCC). Existing distillation protocols assume the

study the case in which communication takes place over noisy binary symmetric

including non-abelian anyon excitations, heat-carrying edge states, and
topological nodes in the Bogoliubov spectra. Nonetheless, and despite major
experimental efforts, we are still lacking unambiguous signatures of such
exotic phenomena. In this context, the recent discovery of coexisting
superconductivity and ferroelectricity in lightly doped and ultra clean
SrTiO$_3$ opens new opportunities. Indeed, a promising route to engineer
topological superconductivity is the combination of strong spin-orbit coupling
and inversion-symmetry breaking. Here we study a three-dimensional parabolic
band minimum with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, whose axis is aligned by the
direction of a ferroelectric moment. We show that all of the aforementioned
phenomena naturally emerge in this model when a magnetic field is applied.
Above a critical Zeeman field, Majorana-Weyl cones emerge regardless of the
electronic density. These cones manifest themselves as Majorana arcs states
appearing on surfaces and tetragonal domain walls. Rotating the magnetic field
with respect to the direction of the ferroelectric moment tilts the
Majorana-Weyl cones, eventually driving them into the type-II state with
Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We then consider the consequences of the orbital
magnetic field. First, the single vortex is found to be surrounded by a
topological halo, and is characterized by two Majorana zero modes: One
localized in the vortex core and the other on the boundary of the topological
halo. Based on a semiclassical argument we show that upon increasing the field
above a critical value the halos overlap and eventually percolate through the
system, causing a bulk topological transition that always precedes the normal
state. Finally, we propose concrete experiments to test our predictions.

discovery of an optical-infrared kilonova and a quasi-periodic oscillation
during a gamma-ray precursor points to a compact object binary merger origin.
The complete understanding of this nearby ($\sim$ 1 billion light-years) burst
will significantly impact our knowledge of GRB progenitors and the physical
processes that lead to electromagnetic emission in compact binary mergers.
Here, we report the discovery of a significant ($\rm >5 \sigma$) transient-like
emission in the high-energy $\rm \gamma$-rays (HE; E$>0.1$ GeV) observed by
Fermi/LAT starting at $10^3$ s after the burst. After an initial phase with a
roughly constant flux ($\rm \sim 5\times 10^{-10}\ erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}$)
lasting $\sim 2\times 10^4$ s, the flux started decreasing and soon went
undetected. The multi-wavelength afterglow emission observed at such late times
is usually in good agreement with synchrotron emission from a relativistic
shock wave that arises as the GRB jet decelerates in the interstellar medium.
However, our detailed modelling of a rich dataset comprising public and
dedicated multi-wavelength observations demonstrates that GeV emission from GRB
211211A is in excess with respect to the expectation of this scenario. We
explore the possibility that the GeV excess is inverse Compton emission due to
the interaction of a long-lived, low-power jet with an external source of

photons for GeV emission in binary neutron star mergers.

compliance checking is tedious and error-prone, and amending flaws discovered
only at construction time causes huge additional costs and delays. Several
tools can check BIM models for conformance with rules/guidelines. For example,
Singapore's CORENET e-Submission System checks fire safety. But since the
current BIM exchange format only contains basic information of building
objects, a separate, ad-hoc model pre-processing is required to determine,
e.g., evacuation routes. Moreover, they face difficulties in adapting existing
built-in rules and/or adding new ones (to cater for building regulations, that
can vary not only among countries but also among parts of the same city), if at
all possible. We propose the use of logic-based executable formalisms (CLP and

reasoning capabilities. Previous experience shows that such formalisms can be
used to uniformly capture and reason with knowledge (including ambiguity) in a
large variety of domains. Additionally, incorporating checking within design

This also prevents erroneous designs from having to be (partially) redone,
which is also costly and burdensome. To validate our proposal, we implemented a

employing a variety of complementary methods to measure the distribution of

it must contain $\lesssim 60\%$ of binaries. Additionally, we find evidence for
significant spin-orbit misalignment among the binary black hole population,

facilitate more robust representation learning on heterogeneous data and
effective knowledge transfer to downstream models. Extensive empirical results
on simulated and real-world medical imaging non-IID federated datasets show
that masked image modeling with Transformers significantly improves the
robustness of models against various degrees of data heterogeneity. Notably,
under severe data heterogeneity, our method, without relying on any additional
pre-training data, achieves an improvement of 5.06%, 1.53% and 4.58% in test

direction to enable a three-dimensional (3D) communication paradigm. However,
designing flying mobile stations involves addressing a daunting number of
challenges, such as an excessive on-board control overhead, variable battery
drain and advanced antenna design. To this end, the newly-born Smart Surfaces

flexibly installed on-board to control the terrestrial propagation environment
from an elevated viewpoint by involving low-complex and battery-limited

the Higgs boson decays to a pair of long-lived dark photons Z$_\mathrm{D}$, and
of a simplified model, in which long-lived particles are produced in decays of
an exotic heavy neutral scalar boson. For the hidden Abelian Higgs model with
$m_\mathrm{Z_D}$ greater than 20 GeV and less than half the mass of the Higgs

  optimal subsampling",,,,,"math.ST cs.IT math.IT stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Faced with massive data, subsampling is a commonly used technique to improve
computational efficiency, and using nonuniform subsampling probabilities is an
effective approach to improve estimation efficiency. For computational
efficiency, subsampling is often implemented with replacement or through
Poisson subsampling. However, no rigorous investigation has been performed to
study the difference between the two subsampling procedures such as their
estimation efficiency and computational convenience. This paper performs a
comparative study on these two different sampling procedures. In the context of
maximizing a general target function, we first derive asymptotic distributions
for estimators obtained from the two sampling procedures. The results show that
the Poisson subsampling may have a higher estimation efficiency. Based on the
asymptotic distributions for both subsampling with replacement and Poisson
subsampling, we derive optimal subsampling probabilities that minimize the
variance functions of the subsampling estimators. These subsampling
probabilities further reveal the similarities and differences between
subsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling. The theoretical
characterizations and comparisons on the two subsampling procedures provide
guidance to select a more appropriate subsampling approach in practice.
Furthermore, practically implementable algorithms are proposed based on the
optimal structural results, which are evaluated through both theoretical and
empirical analyses.

(DL) has raised increasing concerns regarding its dependability. In particular,
DL has a notorious problem of lacking robustness. Despite recent efforts made
in detecting Adversarial Examples (AEs) via state-of-the-art attacking and
testing methods, they are normally input distribution agnostic and/or disregard
the perception quality of AEs. Consequently, the detected AEs are irrelevant
inputs in the application context or unnatural/unrealistic that can be easily
noticed by humans. This may lead to a limited effect on improving the DL
model's dependability, as the testing budget is likely to be wasted on
detecting AEs that are encountered very rarely in its real-life operations. In
this paper, we propose a new robustness testing approach for detecting AEs that
considers both the input distribution and the perceptual quality of inputs. The
two considerations are encoded by a novel hierarchical mechanism. First, at the
feature level, the input data distribution is extracted and approximated by
data compression techniques and probability density estimators. Such quantified
feature level distribution, together with indicators that are highly correlated
with local robustness, are considered in selecting test seeds. Given a test
seed, we then develop a two-step genetic algorithm for local test case
generation at the pixel level, in which two fitness functions work
alternatively to control the quality of detected AEs. Finally, extensive
experiments confirm that our holistic approach considering hierarchical
distributions at feature and pixel levels is superior to state-of-the-arts that
either disregard any input distribution or only consider a single
(non-hierarchical) distribution, in terms of not only the quality of detected
AEs but also improving the overall robustness of the DL model under testing.

from the KZ length by a logarithmic correction. Additional slowing down of the

suppresses the anomalous correlator. The quadratic correlators enter Pfaffians
that yield experimentally relevant kink correlation functions, the probability
distribution of ferromagnetic domain sizes, and, closely related, emptiness
formation probability. The latter takes the form of a Pfaffian of a block
Toeplitz matrix that allows for some analytic asymptotes. Finally, we obtain
further insight into the structure of the state at the end of the ramp by
interpreting it as a paired state of fermionic kinks characterized by its pair

($\mathrm{Pm} \sim 50$). At higher Pm, they transition to a new regime
consistent with a plateau independent of Pm for $\rm Pm \gtrsim 100$. This
trend is independent of the Reynolds number, which may suggest an asymptotic
regime where the energy injection and dissipation are independent of the
diffusive processes. Interestingly, large values of Pm not only lead to intense
small-scale magnetic fields but also to a more efficient dynamo at the largest
scales of the box.

transfers, in a cross-lingual fashion, to low-resource language pairs with

a large-scale parallel multilingual corpus (OPUS-100), this model achieves the
state-of-the-art result on the Tateoba dataset, outperforming an equally-sized
previous model by 8.0 points in accuracy while using less than 0.6% of their

English-centered or not, our model is able to match the performance of the ones
finetuned on all language pairs under the same data budget with less than 2.0
points decrease in accuracy. Furthermore, with the same setup, scaling up the
number of rich-resource language pairs monotonically improves the performance,
reaching a minimum of 0.4 points discrepancy in accuracy, making it less
mandatory to collect any low-resource parallel data. Finally, we conclude
through empirical results and analyses that the performance of the sentence

brain functions and starts many years before its clinical manifestations. A
biomarker that provides a quantitative measure of changes in the brain due to
AD in the early stages would be useful for early diagnosis of AD, but this
would involve dealing with large numbers of people because up to 50% of
dementia sufferers do not receive a formal diagnosis. Thus, there is a need for
accurate, low-cost, and easy-to-use biomarkers that could be used to detect AD
in its early stages. Potentially, electroencephalogram (EEG) based biomarkers
can play a vital role in early diagnosis of AD as they can fulfill these needs.
This is a cross-sectional study that aims to demonstrate the usefulness of EEG
complexity measures in early AD diagnosis. We have focused on the three
complexity methods which have shown the greatest promise in the detection of
AD, Tsallis entropy (TsEn), Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), and Lempel-Ziv
complexity (LZC) methods. Unlike previous approaches, in this study, the
complexity measures are derived from EEG frequency bands (instead of the entire
EEG) as EEG activities have significant association with AD and this has led to
enhanced performance. The results show that AD patients have significantly
lower TsEn, HFD, and LZC values for specific EEG frequency bands and for
specific EEG channels and that this information can be used to detect AD with a
sensitivity and specificity of more than 90%.

photometry. We find the average size of spot features on KOI-340's primary is
$\sim$10% the radius of the star, i.e. two times larger than the mean size of
Solar-maximum sunspots. The spots on KOI-340 are present at every longitude and
show possible signs of differential rotation. The minimum fractional spotted
area of KOI-340's primary is $2\substack{+12\\ -2} \%$ while the spotted area
of the Sun is at most 0.2%. One transit of KOI-340 shows a signal in the
transit consistent with a plage; this plage occurs right before a dark spot
indicating the plage and spot might be co-located on the surface of the star.

  The Optimal Pre-trained Language For English-isiZulu Machine Translation","Accepted at NAACL 2022 Workshop MIA",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stemming from the limited availability of datasets and textual resources for
low-resource languages such as isiZulu, there is a significant need to be able
to harness knowledge from pre-trained models to improve low resource machine
translation. Moreover, a lack of techniques to handle the complexities of
morphologically rich languages has compounded the unequal development of
translation models, with many widely spoken African languages being left
behind. This study explores the potential benefits of transfer learning in an
English-isiZulu translation framework. The results indicate the value of
transfer learning from closely related languages to enhance the performance of
low-resource translation models, thus providing a key strategy for low-resource
translation going forward. We gathered results from 8 different language
corpora, including one multi-lingual corpus, and saw that isiXhosa-isiZulu
outperformed all languages, with a BLEU score of 8.56 on the test set which was
better from the multi-lingual corpora pre-trained model by 2.73. We also
derived a new coefficient, Nasir's Geographical Distance Coefficient (NGDC)
which provides an easy selection of languages for the pre-trained models. NGDC
also indicated that isiXhosa should be selected as the language for the
pre-trained model.

  hybrid minimum principle",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collisions are common in many dynamical systems with real applications. They
can be formulated as hybrid dynamical systems with discontinuities
automatically triggered when states transverse certain manifolds. We present an
algorithm for the optimal control problem of such hybrid dynamical systems
based on solving the equations derived from the hybrid minimum principle (HMP).
The algorithm is an iterative scheme following the spirit of the method of
successive approximations (MSA), and it is robust to undesired collisions
observed in the initial guesses. We analyze the discontinuities in the system
and propose a stable collision condition, which is crucial for the convergence
of iterative algorithms in systems experiencing collisions. Subsequently, we
establish a convergence theorem demonstrating linear convergence for the MSA
algorithm when collisions are present. We also address several numerical
challenges introduced by the discontinuities. The algorithm is tested on disc
collision problems whose optimal solutions exhibit one or multiple collisions.
Linear convergence in terms of iteration steps and asymptotic first-order
accuracy in terms of time discretization are observed when the algorithm is
implemented with the forward-Euler scheme. The numerical results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm has better accuracy and convergence than direct
methods based on gradient descent. Furthermore, the algorithm is also simpler,
more accurate, and more stable than a deep reinforcement learning method.

using a 20kt liquid-scintillator detector. Its key feature is an excellent
energy resolution of at least 3 % at 1 MeV, for which its instruments need to
meet a certain quality and thus have to be fully characterized. More than

testing program which began in 2017 and elapsed for about four years. Based on
this mass characterization and a set of specific requirements, a good quality
of all accepted PMTs could be ascertained. This paper presents the performed
testing procedure with the designed testing systems as well as the statistical
characteristics of all 20-inch PMTs intended to be used in the JUNO experiment,
covering more than fifteen performance parameters including the photocathode
uniformity. This constitutes the largest sample of 20-inch PMTs ever produced
and studied in detail to date, i.e. 15,000 of the newly developed 20-inch
MCP-PMTs from Northern Night Vision Technology Co. (NNVT) and 5,000 of dynode

variable instantiation with the highest probability given some evidence. Since
a Bayesian network can be encoded as a literal-weighted CNF formula $\varphi$,
we study Boolean MPE, a more general problem that requests a model $\tau$ of
$\varphi$ with the highest weight, where the weight of $\tau$ is the product of
weights of literals satisfied by $\tau$. It is known that Boolean MPE can be
solved via reduction to (weighted partial) MaxSAT. Recent work proposed DPMC, a
dynamic-programming model counter that leverages graph-decomposition techniques
to construct project-join trees. A project-join tree is an execution plan that
specifies how to conjoin clauses and project out variables. We build on DPMC
and introduce DPO, a dynamic-programming optimizer that exactly solves Boolean
MPE. By using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to represent pseudo-Boolean
(PB) functions, DPO is able to handle disjunctive clauses as well as XOR
clauses. (Cardinality constraints and PB constraints may also be compactly
represented by ADDs, so one can further extend DPO's support for hybrid
inputs.) To test the competitiveness of DPO, we generate random XOR-CNF
formulas. On these hybrid benchmarks, DPO significantly outperforms MaxHS,

classification risk depends only on the direction of the regressor, and we take
advantage of this scale invariance to improve existing guarantees for how
classification risk is bounded by the risk in the intermediate regression
problem. Building on these guarantees, our analysis makes it possible to
compare algorithms more accurately against each other and suggests viewing

ability to efficiently solve constrained optimization problems in machine
learning and high-dimensional statistics. As such, there is much interest in
establishing when the algorithm may possess a ""linear"" $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
dimension-free iteration complexity comparable to projected gradient descent.
  In this paper, we provide a general technique for establishing domain
specific and easy-to-estimate lower bounds for Frank-Wolfe and its variants
using the metric entropy of the domain. Most notably, we show that a
dimension-free linear upper bound must fail not only in the worst case, but in
the \emph{average case}: for a Gaussian or spherical random polytope in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\mathrm{poly}(d)$ vertices, Frank-Wolfe requires up to
$\tilde\Omega(d)$ iterations to achieve a $O(1/d)$ error bound, with high
probability. We also establish this phenomenon for the nuclear norm ball.
  The link with metric entropy also has interesting positive implications for
conditional gradient algorithms in statistics, such as gradient boosting and
matching pursuit. In particular, we show that it is possible to extract
fast-decaying upper bounds on the excess risk directly from an analysis of the
underlying optimization procedure.

internally driven active fluids that generate flows spontaneously? By using
numerical simulations and stability analysis we explore how surface anchoring
of active agents at the boundaries and substrate drag can be used to rectify
coherent flow of an active polar fluid in a 2D channel. Upon increasing
activity, a succession of dynamical states is obtained, from laminar flow to
vortex arrays to eventual turbulence, that are controlled by the interplay
between the hydrodynamic screening length and the extrapolation length
quantifying the anchoring strength of the orientational order parameter. We
highlight the key role of symmetry in both flow and order and show that
coherent laminar flow with net throughput is only possible for weak anchoring

the kilonovae of neutron star mergers. Gravitational wave detectors are
expected to provide locations to not better than 10 square degrees over the

However, NC-enabled systems need to address security challenges specific to NC,

This paper proposes a blockchain-assisted key distribution protocol tailored
for MAC-based integrity schemes, which combined with an uplink reference signal

analysis of the protocol during handover scenarios indicates its suitability
for ensuring high level of security against pollution attacks in dense small

proposed scheme achieves lower bandwidth and signaling overhead during handover
compared to legacy schemes and the signaling cost reduces significantly as the

a multiple-access channel, where the number of devices $n\geq 2$ is unknown. It
is well-known that for polynomial-time randomized leader election algorithms
with success probability $1-1/poly(n)$, the optimal energy complexity is
$\Theta(\log\log^*n)$ if receivers can detect collisions, and $\Theta(\log^*n)$
otherwise.
  Without collision detection, all existing randomized leader election
algorithms using $o(\log\log n)$ energy are Monte Carlo in that they may fail
with some small probability, and they may consume unbounded energy and never
halt when they fail. Though the optimal energy complexity of leader election
appears to be settled, it is still an open question to attain the optimal
$O(\log^*n)$ energy complexity by an efficient Las Vegas algorithm that never
fails. In this paper we address this fundamental question.
  $\textbf{Separation between Monte Carlo and Las Vegas:}$ Without collision
detection, we prove that any Las Vegas leader election algorithm with finite
expected time complexity must use $\Omega(\log\log n)$ energy, establishing a
large separation between Monte Carlo and Las Vegas algorithms.
  $\textbf{Exponential improvement with sender collision detection:}$ In the
setting where senders can detect collisions, we design a new leader election
algorithm that finishes in $O(\log^{1+\epsilon}n)$ time and uses
$O(\epsilon^{-1}\log\log\log n)$ energy in expectation, showing that sender
collision detection helps improve the energy complexity exponentially.
  $\textbf{Optimal deterministic leader election algorithm:}$ As a side result,
via derandomization, we show a new deterministic algorithm that takes
$O(n\log(N/n))$ time and $O(\log(N/n))$ energy to elect a leader from $n$

the ""parallel trends"" assumption. To increase the plausibility of this
assumption, a natural idea is to match treated and control units prior to a DiD
analysis. In this paper, we characterize the bias of matching prior to a DiD
analysis under a linear structural model. Our framework allows for both
observed and unobserved confounders that have time varying effects. Given this
framework, we find that matching on baseline covariates reduces the bias
associated with these covariates, when compared to the original DiD estimator.
We further find that additionally matching on the pre-treatment outcomes has
both cost and benefit. First, it mitigates the bias associated with unobserved
confounders, since matching on pre-treatment outcomes partially balances these
unobserved confounders. This reduction is proportional to the reliability of
the outcome, a measure of how coupled the outcomes are with these latent
covariates. On the other hand, we find that matching on the pre-treatment
outcome undermines the second ""difference"" in a DiD estimate by forcing the
treated and control group's pre-treatment outcomes to be equal. This injects
bias into the final estimate, analogous to the case when parallel trends holds.
We extend our bias results to multivariate confounders with multiple
pre-treatment periods and find similar results. Finally, we provide heuristic
guidelines to practitioners on whether to match prior to their DiD analysis,
along with a method for roughly estimating the reduction in bias. We illustrate
our guidelines by reanalyzing a recent empirical study that used matching prior
to a DiD analysis to explore the impact of principal turnover on student
achievement. We find that the authors' decision to match on the pre-treatment
outcomes was crucial in making the estimated treatment effect more credible.

aimed at maintaining conditions compatible with life. Typical artificial
systems are not equipped with comparable regulatory features. Here, we
introduce an artificial neural network that incorporates homeostatic features.
Its own computing substrate is placed in a needful and vulnerable relation to
the very objects over which it computes. For example, artificial neurons
performing classification of MNIST digits or Fashion-MNIST articles of clothing
may receive excitatory or inhibitory effects, which alter their own learning
rate as a direct result of perceiving and classifying the digits. In this
scenario, accurate recognition is desirable to the agent itself because it
guides decisions to regulate its vulnerable internal states and functionality.
Counterintuitively, the addition of vulnerability to a learner does not
necessarily impair its performance. On the contrary, self-regulation in
response to vulnerability confers benefits under certain conditions. We show
that homeostatic design confers increased adaptability under concept shift, in
which the relationships between labels and data change over time, and that the
greatest advantages are obtained under the highest rates of shift. This
necessitates the rapid un-learning of past associations and the re-learning of
new ones. We also demonstrate the superior abilities of homeostatic learners in
environments with dynamically changing rates of concept shift. Our homeostatic
design exposes the artificial neural network's thinking machinery to the

the corresponding cotopological localization of its ordinary geometric sheaf

characterized by a limit preservation property that is generally not captured

critical discussion on applying the Kutta condition in unsteady flows, and
introduces an improved method of doing so in unsteady thin-aerofoil theory.
Specifically, the shed wake at any discrete time step is represented by a
continuous distribution of vorticity derived from the exact Wagner solution
rather than by a point vortex or regularized vortex blob. Results in the

type N and vacuum type D solutions, the finding explicitly shows that the
single and zeroth copies fulfill conformally invariant field equations in
conformally flat spacetime. In addition, irrespective of the presence of a
cosmological constant, we demonstrate that the zeroth copy connects Dirac-Weyl
fields with the degenerate electromagnetic fields in the curved spacetime in
addition to connecting gravity fields with the single copy in conformally flat
spacetime. Moreover, the study also demonstrates the critical significance the
zeroth copy plays in time-dependent radiation solutions. In particular, for
Robinson-Trautman ($\Lambda$) gravitational waves, unlike the single copy, we
find that the zeroth copy carries additional information to specify whether the
sources of associated gravitational waves are time-like, null, or space-like,
at least in the weak field limit.

It is demonstrated that the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) and helicity of each

two-dimensional mappings of probability amplitude can be rotated in the
polarization plane with changing the CEP of the driving pulse (or two

collaborate helping each other. For these collaborations to be effective and
safe, robots need to model, predict and exploit human's intents for responsive
decision making processes.
  Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is an analysis-by-synthesis approach
to perform probabilistic predictions upon uncertain quantities. ABC includes
priors conveniently, leverages sampling algorithms for inference and is
flexible to benefit from complex models, e.g. via simulators. However, ABC is
known to be computationally too intensive to run at interactive frame rates
required for effective human-robot collaboration tasks.
  In this paper, we formulate human reaching intent prediction as an ABC
problem and describe two key performance innovations which allow computations
at interactive rates. Our real-world experiments with a collaborative robot
set-up, demonstrate the viability of our proposed approach. Experimental
evaluations convey the advantages and value of human intent prediction for
packing cooperative tasks. Qualitative results show how anticipating human's
reaching intent improves human-robot collaboration without compromising safety.
Quantitative task fluency metrics confirm the qualitative claims.

generic domain of control parameters, in particular in the subcritical regime.
Contrary to previous models, here the coordination of opinions and actions and
the associated global macroscopic order do not require the fine-tuning close to
a critical point. This is illustrated in the context of financial markets
theoretically, numerically via agent-based simulations and empirically through
the analysis of so-called meme stocks. It is shown that the size of the bubble
is directly controlled through the Kreiss constant which measures the degree of
non-normality in the network. This mapping improves conceptually and
operationally on existing methods aimed at anticipating critical phase
transitions, which do not take into consideration the ubiquitous non-normality
of complex system dynamics. Our mechanism thus provides a general alternative
to the previous understanding of instabilities in a large class of complex

set of degrees of freedom. Here, going beyond slow- and fast-driving
approximations employed in previous studies, we obtain exact finite-time
optimal protocols for this unexplored limited-control setting. By working with
deterministic Fokker-Planck probability density time evolution, we can frame
the work-minimizing protocol problem in the standard form of an optimal control
theory problem. We demonstrate that finding the exact optimal protocol is
equivalent to solving a system of Hamiltonian partial differential equations,
which in many cases admit efficiently calculatable numerical solutions. Within
this framework, we reproduce analytical results for the optimal control of
harmonic potentials, and numerically devise novel optimal protocols for two
anharmonic examples: varying the stiffness of a quartic potential, and linearly
biasing a double-well potential. We confirm that these optimal protocols
outperform other protocols produced through previous methods, in some cases by
a substantial amount. We find that for the linearly biased double-well problem,
the mean position under the optimal protocol travels at a near-constant
velocity. Surprisingly, for a certain timescale and barrier height regime, the
optimal protocol is also non-monotonic in time.

occur in correspondence of current sheets with a thickness of the order of the

algorithm which provides self-supervised segmentation of a 4-band image
(RGB-NIR) for a $k$ number of classes. An example of its application on high
resolution Planet satellite imagery is given. Our algorithm shows that discrete
search is feasible using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and gradient
descent. The model detects $k$ hard clustering classes represented in the model
as $k$ discrete binary masks and their associated $k$ independently generated
textures, that combined are a simulation of the original image. The similarity
loss is the mean squared error between the features of the original and the
simulated image, both extracted from the penultimate convolutional block of
Keras 'imagenet' pretrained VGG-16 model and a custom feature extractor made
with Planet data. The main advances of the k-textures model are: first, the $k$
discrete binary masks are obtained inside the model using gradient descent. The
model allows for the generation of discrete binary masks using a novel method
using a hard sigmoid activation function. Second, it provides hard clustering
classes -- each pixels has only one class. Finally, in comparison to k-means,
where each pixel is considered independently, here, contextual information is
also considered and each class is not associated only to similar values in the
color channels but also to a texture. Our approach is designed to ease the
production of training samples for satellite image segmentation and the

energy-saving strategy on EV by optimizing the energy cost of the PnG operation
using Intelligent Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (IGPSO).
This paper builds up a simulation model of an EV with regenerative braking and
ACCS based on which the performance of PGACCS and regenerative braking is
evaluated; the PnG energy performance is optimized and the effect of
regenerative braking on PnG energy performance is evaluated. As a result of PnG
optimization, the PnG operation in the PGACCS could cut down 28.3% energy cost
of the EV compared to the CC operation in the traditional ACCS which verifies
that PnG is an effective energy-saving strategy for EV and PGACCS is a
promising option for EV.

Energy localization or hotspots arise during shock interaction with the

artificially incorporating such on-site interactions for localized electrons in
the model form. The layered antiferromagnet NaMnCl$_3$ reveals quite a
different story: while the Coulomb $U$ on the Mn sites controls the strength of
antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions, an equally important parameter is
the Stoner coupling ${\cal I}_{\rm Cl}$ on the ligand sites. The latter is

interactions, which in NaMnCl$_3$ nearly cancel the effect of the superexchange
interactions. Although such behavior is anticipated from the phenomenological
Goodenough-Kamanori-Anderson rules, the quantitative description of the

improved to 104(43) GeV, 650(167) GeV and 480(137) GeV respectively, assuming
the diffusion coefficient $D_0 \le 10^{26}(10^{27})$ cm$^2$/s. These

of the gamma-ray excess and anti-proton excess seen in our Galaxy. Generally
speaking, the conservative lower limits obtained for non-leptophilic
annihilation channels are much more stringent than that obtained by gamma-ray
analysis of nearby dwarf galaxies. We anticipate that this would open a new
window for constraining annihilating dark matter.

hyperparameter optimization is essential in developing deep learning

highly demand rapid hyperparameter optimization algorithms. In order to keep
pace with the needs of faster hyperparameter optimization algorithms,
researchers are focusing on improving the speed of hyperparameter optimization
algorithm. However, the huge time consumption of hyperparameter optimization
due to the high computational cost of the deep learning model itself has not
been dealt with in-depth. Like using surrogate model in Bayesian optimization,
to solve this problem, it is necessary to consider proxy model for a neural
network (N_B) to be used for hyperparameter optimization. Inspired by the main
goal of neural network pruning, i.e., high computational cost reduction and
performance preservation, we presumed that the neural network (N_P) obtained
through neural network pruning would be a good proxy model of N_B. In order to
verify our idea, we performed extensive experiments by using CIFAR10, CFIAR100,

to skewed distributions, and their offline training fashion is vulnerable to
unforeseen changes in future load patterns. Therefore, we propose an optimal PI
estimation approach, which is online and adaptive to different data
distributions by adaptively determining symmetric or asymmetric probability
proportion pairs for quantiles. It relies on the online learning ability of
reinforcement learning to integrate the two online tasks, i.e., the adaptive
selection of probability proportion pairs and quantile predictions, both of
which are modeled by neural networks. As such, the quality of quantiles-formed
PI can guide the selection process of optimal probability proportion pairs,
which forms a closed loop to improve the quality of PIs. Furthermore, to
improve the learning efficiency of quantile forecasts, a prioritized experience
replay strategy is proposed for online quantile regression processes. Case
studies on both load and net load demonstrate that the proposed method can
better adapt to data distribution compared with online central PIs method.
Compared with offline-trained methods, it obtains PIs with better quality and
is more robust against concept drift.

learning, but these two aspects are often incompatible with each other so that
enhancing one aspect may sacrifice the other inevitably with side effects of

accurate fairness, to align individual fairness with accuracy. Informally, it
requires the treatments of an individual and the individual's similar
counterparts to conform to a uniform target, i.e., the ground truth of the
individual. We prove that accurate fairness also implies typical group fairness
criteria over a union of similar sub-populations. We then present a Siamese
fairness in-processing approach to minimize the accuracy and fairness losses of
a machine learning model under the accurate fairness constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time that a Siamese approach is adapted for
bias mitigation. We also propose fairness confusion matrix-based metrics,
fair-precision, fair-recall, and fair-F1 score, to quantify a trade-off between
accuracy and individual fairness. Comparative case studies with popular
fairness datasets show that our Siamese fairness approach can achieve on
average 1.02%-8.78% higher individual fairness (in terms of fairness through

available. In this work, we propose SemiCurv, a semi-supervised learning (SSL)
framework for curvilinear structure segmentation that is able to utilize such

challenges in formulating curvilinear segmentation in a semi-supervised manner.
First, to fully exploit the power of consistency based SSL, we introduce a
geometric transformation as strong data augmentation and then align
segmentation predictions via a differentiable inverse transformation to enable
the computation of pixel-wise consistency. Second, the traditional mean square
error (MSE) on unlabelled data is prone to collapsed predictions and this issue
exacerbates with severe class imbalance (significantly more background pixels).
We propose a N-pair consistency loss to avoid trivial predictions on unlabelled

removing hand-crafted processes such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). However,

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to train an end-to-end multi-object

regularization term. In doing so, the multi-object detection problem is treated
as density estimation of the ground truth bounding boxes utilizing a
regularized mixture density model. The proposed \textit{end-to-end multi-object
Detection with a Regularized Mixture Model} (D-RMM) is trained by minimizing
the NLL with the proposed regularization term, maximum component maximization

infected host mortality, population diffusion rate and reducing reproduction
ability of infected hosts on population activities in different degrees.
Theoretically, we give the general conditions for the stability of the model
under non-diffusion and considering the Turing instability caused by diffusion.
Our results indicate how fear affects the distribution of the uninfected and
infected hosts in the habitat and quantify the influence of the fear factor on
the spatiotemporal pattern of the population. In addition, we analyze the
influence of natural death rate, reproduction ability of infected hosts, and
diffusion level of uninfected (infected) hosts on the spatiotemporal pattern,
respectively. The results present that the growth of pattern induced by
intensified fear effect follows the certain rule: cold spots $\rightarrow$ cold
spots-stripes $\rightarrow$ cold stripes $\rightarrow$ hot stripes
$\rightarrow$ hot spots-stripes $\rightarrow$ hot spots. Interestingly, the
natural mortality and fear effect take the opposite effect on the growth order

to massless scalar field in the Minkowski vacuum. It has been shown that for an
inertial detector moving with a constant velocity, its quantum Fisher
information is completely unaffected by the velocity, however, it still decays
over time due to the decoherence caused by the interaction between the atom and
the field. In addition, for a uniformly accelerated detector ($w=0$) moving
along spatially straight line, the accelerated motion will reduce the quantum
Fisher information in the estimation of state parameters. However, when the
detector trajectory is generated by a combination of the linear accelerated
motion and a component of the four-velocity $w=dy/d\tau$, we find quite unlike
the previous results that, for the non-relativistic case $(w\ll1)$, the
acceleration could degrade the quantum Fisher information, while the
four-velocity component will suppress the degradation of the quantum Fisher
information, and thus could enhance the precision of parameters estimation.
Furthermore, in the case for ultra-relativistic velocities
$(w\rightarrow\infty)$, although the detector still interacts with the
environment, it behaves as if it were a closed system as a consequence of
relativity correction associated to the velocity, and the quantum Fisher
information in this case can be shield from the effect of the external
environment, and thus from the relativistic motion.

with the variability of their central engine. We study both fast and slowly
rotating black holes and address our simulations to active galaxy (AGN) centers
and gamma ray burst (GRB) engines. The structured jets are postulated to
account for emission properties of high energy sources across the mass scale,
launched from stellar mass black holes in GRBs and from supermassive black
holes in AGNs. Their active cores contain magnetized accretion disks and
rotation of the Kerr black hole provides a mechanism for jet launching. This
process works most effectively if the mode of accretion is magnetically
arrested (MAD). In this mode, the modulation of jets launched from the engine
is related to internal instabilities in the accretion flow that operate on
smallest time and spatial scales. As these scales are related to the
light-crossing time and the black hole gravitational radius, the universal
model of jet-disk connection is expected to scale with the black hole mass. We
investigate the jet-disk connection by means of 3D GR MHD simulations of the
MAD accretion in Kerr metric. We quantify the variability of the disk by means
of a Fourier analysis. We found that the evolution is governed by the physical
parameters of the engine such as the black hole spin and disk size as well as
its magnetization, and we applied our scenarios to typical types of sources in
AGN and GRB classes. We found that the MAD scenario is applicable to AGN
engines and supports persistent jet emission. It can also be applied to GRBs,
as it gives the variability pattern roughly consistent with observations.
However, in some cases, strong magnetic fields may lead to jet quenching, and
this effect is found to be important mainly for GRB jets. We speculate that it
may be related to the strength of magnetically driven winds from the GRB
engines.

$\mathrm{97.2\%}$. We then use the above model for classifying $\mathrm{1,354}$
new spirals from the SDSS. Out of these, $\mathrm{721}$ were identified as {\it
Flocculents}, and the rest as {\it Grand-designs}. We find the median
asymptotic rotational velocities of our newly classified {\it Grand-designs}
and {\it Flocculents} are $218 \pm 86$ and $145 \pm 67$ respectively,
indicating that the {\it Grand-designs} are mostly the high-mass and the {\it
Flocculents} the intermediate-mass spirals. This is further corroborated by the
observation that the median morphological indices of the {\it Grand-designs}
and {\it Flocculents} are $2.6 \pm 1.8$ and $4.7 \pm 1.9$ respectively,
implying that the {\it Flocculents} primarily consist of a late-type galaxy
population in contrast to the {\it Grand-designs}. Finally, an almost equal
fraction of of bars $\sim$ 0.3 in both the classes of spiral galaxies reveals
that the presence of a bar component does not regulate the type of spiral arm
hosted by a galaxy. Our results may have important implications for formation
and evolution of spiral arms in galaxies.

  electrokinetic instability",,,"10.1063/5.0099481",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When two fluids of different electrical conductivities are transported side
by side in a microfluidic device under the influence of an electric field, an
electrokinetic instability (EKI) is often generated after some critical values
of the applied electric field strength and conductivity ratio. Many prior
experimental and numerical studies show that this phenomenon results in a
chaotic flow field inside a microdevice, thereby facilitating the mixing of two
fluids if they are Newtonian in behaviour. However, the present numerical study
shows that this chaotic convection arising due to the electrokinetic
instability can be suppressed if the fluids are viscoelastic instead of
Newtonian ones. In particular, we observe that as the Weissenberg number (ratio
of the elastic to that of the viscous forces) gradually increases and the
polymer viscosity ratio (ratio of the solvent viscosity to that of the
zero-shear rate viscosity of the polymeric solution) gradually decreases, the
chaotic fluctuation inside a T microfluidic junction decreases within the
present range of conditions encompassed in this study. We demonstrate that this
suppression of the chaotic motion occurs due to the formation of a strand of
high elastic stresses at the interface of the two fluids. We further show that
this suppression of the chaotic fluctuation (particularly the span-wise one)
inhibits the mixing of two viscoelastic fluids. Therefore, one needs to be
cautious when the EKI phenomenon is planned to use to mix such viscoelastic
fluids. Our observations are in line with that seen in limited experimental
studies conducted for these kinds of viscoelastic fluids.

Unfortunately, those keV emitters from electron microscopes or dielectric laser

strong coupling between the electron and the guided wave in a structure with
distributed feedback, a single 50-keV electron generates 1.5-um laser-like

cooling an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power module. The thermal
behavior of the heat sink is originally estimated using a high-fidelity
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, which renders numerical
optimization too computationally demanding. To enable optimization studies, we
substitute the CFD simulation model with an inexpensive polynomial surrogate
model that approximates the relation between the device's design features and a
relevant thermal quantity of interest. The surrogate model of choice is a
data-driven polynomial chaos expansion (DD-PCE), which learns the
aforementioned relation by means of polynomial regression. Advantages of the
DD-PCE include its applicability in small-data regimes and its easily adaptable
model structure. To address the issue of model-form uncertainty and model
robustness in view of limited training and test data, ensembles of DD-PCEs are
generated based on data re-shuffling. Then, using the full ensemble of
surrogate models, the surrogate-based predictions are accompanied by
uncertainty metrics such as mean value and variance. Once trained and tested in
terms of accuracy and robustness, the ensemble of DD-PCE surrogates replaces
the high-fidelity simulation model in optimization algorithms aiming to
identify heat sink designs that optimize the thermal behavior of the IGBT under
geometrical and operational constraints. Optimized heat sink designs are
obtained for a computational cost much smaller than utilizing the original
model in the optimization procedure. Due to ensemble modeling, the optimization
results can also be assessed in terms of uncertainty and robustness.
Comparisons against alternative surrogate modeling techniques illustrate why
the DD-PCE should be preferred in the considered setting.

work in 1D. These PDEs approximate dynamics of the complex roots for random
polynomials of sufficiently high degree n. The unit of the time t corresponds
to n differentiations, and the increment $\Delta$t corresponds to 1 n. The
general situation in 2D, in particular for complex roots of real polynomials,

in that direction. We assume that the roots are distributed according to a
regular distribution with a local homogeneity property (defined in the text),
and that this property is maintained under differentiation. This allows us to
derive a system of two coupled equations to model the motion. Our system could

three-dimensional refractive index fields which usually change in space and in

three-dimensional flow, which is from a direct numerical simulation of
single-phase turbulent mixing of two fluids. Given the data of the numerical
simulation as reference, the ray tracing simulation is used to quantify the
measurement errors of the flow velocity and flow acceleration for tracer-based
velocimetry, i.e. particle tracking velocimetry in this study. The errors of
both flow velocity and flow acceleration are attributed to the spatial and the

closely inherited from flow characteristics. While the dominant type of error
depends on the studied flow, the main measurement error for the considered

relative random measurement error is about 1 % in velocity and about 200 % in

every $\varphi$ is uniquely determined (up to a constant phase factor) by the
phaseless data $(|T_j\varphi|)_{j\in J}$. This problem arises in various fields
of applied sciences where usually the operators obey further restrictions. Of
particular interest here are so-called {\em coded diffraction paterns} where
the operators are of the form $T_j\varphi=\mathcal{F}m_j\varphi$, $\mathcal{F}$
the Fourier transform and $m_j\in L^\infty(R)$ are ""masks"". Here we explicitely
construct three real-valued masks $m_1,m_2,m_3\in L^\infty(R)$ so that the
associated coded diffraction patterns do phase retrieval. This implies that the
three self-adjoint operators
$T_j\varphi=\mathcal{F}[m_j\mathcal{F}^{-1}\varphi]$ also do phase retrieval.
The proof uses complex analysis.We then show that some natural analogues of
these operators in the finite dimensional setting do not always lead to the
same uniqueness result due to an undersampling effect.

  Networks and Point-weighting Method",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a deep learning framework
for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and have been
widely used in a variety of PDE problems. However, there still remain some
challenges in the application of PINNs: 1) the mechanism of PINNs is unsuitable
(at least cannot be directly applied) to exploiting a small size of (usually
very few) extra informative samples to refine the networks; and 2) the
efficiency of training PINNs often becomes low for some complicated PDEs. In
this paper, we propose the generative adversarial physics-informed neural
network (GA-PINN), which integrates the generative adversarial (GA) mechanism
with the structure of PINNs, to improve the performance of PINNs by exploiting
only a small size of exact solutions to the PDEs. Inspired from the weighting
strategy of the Adaboost method, we then introduce a point-weighting (PW)
method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs, where the weight of each
sample point is adaptively updated at each training iteration. The numerical
experiments show that GA-PINNs outperform PINNs in many well-known PDEs and the
PW method also improves the efficiency of training PINNs and GA-PINNs.

local gas temperatures provided by ALMA with the temperature diagnostics
provided by non-LTE inversions using STIC. In performing these inversions, we
find that using column mass as the reference height scale, rather than optical
depth, provides more reliable atmospheric profiles above the temperature
minimum and that the treatment of non- LTE hydrogen ionization brings the
inferred chromospheric temperatures into better agreement with the ALMA
measurements. The Band 3 brightness temperatures are higher but well correlated
with the inversion-derived temperatures at the height of formation of the Ca
8542 line core. The Band 6 temperatures instead do not show good correlations
with the temperatures at any specific layer in the inverted atmospheres. We
then performed inversions that included the millimeter continuum intensities as
an additional constraint. Incorporating Band 3 generally resulted in
atmospheres showing a strong temperature rise in the upper atmosphere, while
including Band 6 led to significant regions of anomalously low temperatures at
chromospheric heights. This is consistent with the idea that the Band 6
emission can come from a range of heights. The poor constraints on the
chromospheric electron density with existing inversion codes introduces
difficulties in determining the height(s) of formation of the millimeter

physics-inspired model to explain this oscillation and use a high-resolution

of the liquid determine the decay rate and frequency of the oscillation. We
then train a Gaussian Process Regression model on a small amount of the real
data to estimate the liquid properties. Experiments show that our model can
classify three different liquids with 100% accuracy. The model can estimate
volume with high precision and even estimate the concentration of sugar-water
solution. It is data-efficient and can easily generalize to other liquids and
bottles. Our work posed a physically-inspired understanding of the correlation
between dynamic tactile signals and the dynamic performance of the liquid. Our
approach creates a good balance between simplicity, accuracy, and generality.
It will help robots to better perceive liquids in different environments such

given a graph, for every edge independently, we delete the edge with
probability $1-p$. Bond percolation is motivated by problems in mathematical
physics and it is studied in parallel computing and network science to
understand the resilience of distributed systems to random link failure and the
spread of information in networks through unreliable links.
  Full-bond percolation is also equivalent to the \emph{Reed-Frost process}, a
network version of \emph{SIR} epidemic spreading, in which the graph represents
contacts among people and $p$ corresponds to the probability that a contact
between an infected person and a susceptible one causes a transmission of the
infection.
  We consider \emph{one-dimensional power-law small-world graphs} with
parameter $\alpha$ obtained as the union of a cycle with additional long-range
random edges: each pair of nodes $(u,v)$ at distance $L$ on the cycle is
connected by a long-range edge $(u,v)$, with probability proportional to
$1/L^\alpha$. Our analysis determines three phases for the percolation subgraph
$G_p$ of the small-world graph, depending on the value of $\alpha$.
  1) If $\alpha < 1$, there is a $p<1$ such that, with high probability, there
are $\Omega(n)$ nodes that are reachable in $G_p$ from one another in $O(\log
n)$ hops;
  2) If $1 < \alpha < 2$, there is a $p<1$ such that, with high probability,
there are $\Omega(n)$ nodes that are reachable in $G_p$ from one another in
$\log^{O(1)}(n)$ hops;
  3) If $\alpha > 2$, for every $p<1$, with high probability all connected
components of $G_p$ have size $O(\log n)$.
  The setting of full-bond percolation in finite graphs studied in this paper,
which is the one that corresponds to the network SIR model of epidemic
spreading, had not been analyzed before.

increase the efficiency of thermal apparatus. Heat manipulators control and
manipulate heat flow. A key to the effective performance of these heat
manipulators is their thermal design. Such designs can be achieved by a
periodic assembly of unit cells (known as metamaterials or meta-structure),
whose geometry and material properties can be optimized for a specific
objective. In this work, we focus on thermal metamaterial-based heat
manipulators such as thermal concentrator (which concentrates the heat flux in
a specified region of the domain). The main scope of the current work is to
optimize the shape of the heat manipulators using Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) method. The geometry is defined using NURBS basis functions due to the
higher smoothness and continuity and the thermal boundary value problem is
solved using Isogeometric Analysis (IGA). Often, nodes as design variables (as
in Lagrange finite element method) generate the serrate shapes of boundaries
which need to be smoothened later. For the NURBS-based boundary with the
control points as design variables, the required smoothness can be predefined
through knot vectors and smoothening in the post-processing can be avoided. The
optimized shape generated by PSO is compared with the other shape exploited in
the literature. The effects of the number of design variables, the thermal
conductivity of the materials used, as well as some of the geometry parameters
on the optimum shapes are also demonstrated.

  Features",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In existing biometric authentication methods, the user must perform an
authentication operation such as placing a finger in a scanner or facing a
camera. With ear acoustic authentication, acoustic characteristics of the ear
canal are used as biometric information. Therefore, a person wearing earphones
does not need to perform any authentication operation. In biometric
authentication, it is necessary to minimize the false acceptance rate (FAR) so
that no unauthorized user is misidentified as an authorized user. However, if
the FAR is set low, it increases the false rejection rate (FRR), the rate at
which authorized users are falsely recognized as unauthorized users. It has
been reported that when FAR is 0.1%, the FRR in ear acoustic authentication
reaches as much as 22%. In this study, we propose a method that reduces FRR and
enhances authentication accuracy; it generates new ear canal acoustic
characteristics called between-class (BC) features, which combine the ear canal
acoustic characteristics of authorized and unauthorized users features. The
proposed method uses a support vector machine to learn the BC features as the
data of authorized users, then generates a hyperplane in an area close to that
data. We hypothesize that this would decrease the possibility of misidentifying
an unauthorized user as an authorized user and decrease the FRR when the FAR is
0.1%. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, BC features were
applied to ear acoustic authentication, and FAR and FRR were calculated. The
FRR with FAR = 0.1% was 7.95% lower than with the previous method, and the
equal error rate -- the error rate when FAR and FRR are equivalent -- decreased
by 0.15%. These results confirmed that the proposed method can make ear
acoustic authentication more convenient while maintaining a high level of
security.

studies showed that in binary systems the majority of the accreted mass falls
onto the lighter star, thus evolving to mass equalisation. However, young
stellar systems often comprise more than two stars, which are expected to be in
hierarchical configurations. Despite its astrophysical relevance, differential
accretion in hierarchical systems remains to be understood. In this work, we
investigate whether the accretion trends expected in binaries are valid for
higher order multiples. We performed a set of 3D Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics simulations of binaries and of hierarchical triples (HTs)
embedded in an accretion disc, with the code Phantom. We identify for the first
time accretion trends in HTs and their deviations compared to binaries. These
deviations, due to the interaction of the small binary with the infalling
material from the circum-triple disc, can be described with a semi-analytical
prescription. Generally, the smaller binary of a HT accretes more mass than a
single star of the same mass as the smaller binary. We found that in a HT, if
the small binary is heavier than the third body, the standard differential
accretion scenario (whereby the secondary accretes more of the mass) is
hampered. Reciprocally, if the small binary is lighter than the third body, the
standard differential accretion scenario is enhanced. The peculiar differential
accretion mechanism we find in HTs is expected to affect their mass ratio
distribution.

solutions mainly focus on limited context information generally processed on
centralized architectures, potentially exposing users' personal data to privacy
leakage, and missing personalization features. For these reasons on-device
context modeling and recognition represent the current research trend in this
area. Among the different information characterizing the user's context in
mobile environments, social interactions and visited locations remarkably
contribute to the characterization of daily life scenarios. In this paper we
propose a novel, unsupervised and lightweight approach to model the user's
social context and her locations based on ego networks directly on the user
mobile device. Relying on this model, the system is able to extract high-level
and semantic-rich context features from smartphone-embedded sensors data.
Specifically, for the social context it exploits data related to both physical

context is concerned, we assume that it is more relevant to model the
familiarity degree of a specific location for the user's context than the raw
location data, both in terms of GPS coordinates and proximity devices. By using
5 real-world datasets, we assess the structure of the social and location ego
networks, we provide a semantic evaluation of the proposed models and a
complexity evaluation in terms of mobile computing performance. Finally, we
demonstrate the relevance of the extracted features by showing the performance
of 3 machine learning algorithms to recognize daily-life situations, obtaining
an improvement of 3% of AUROC, 9% of Precision, and 5% in terms of Recall with
respect to use only features related to physical context.

identifying logical reasoning phenomena in massive text corpus via detection

statements. Inspired by the facilitation effect of reflective thinking in human
learning, we analogically simulate the learning-thinking process with an
adversarial Generator-Verifier architecture to assist logic learning. LogiGAN
implements a novel sequential GAN approach that (a) circumvents the
non-differentiable challenge of the sequential GAN by leveraging the Generator
as a sentence-level generative likelihood scorer with a learning objective of
reaching scoring consensus with the Verifier; (b) is computationally feasible
for large-scale pre-training with arbitrary target length. Both base and large
size language models pre-trained with LogiGAN demonstrate obvious performance
improvement on 12 datasets requiring general reasoning abilities, revealing the
fundamental role of logic in broad reasoning, as well as the effectiveness of
LogiGAN. Ablation studies on LogiGAN components reveal the relative
orthogonality between linguistic and logic abilities and suggest that
reflective thinking's facilitation effect might also generalize to machine
learning.

learning algorithms that provide a framework for modelling the governing
equations of a system from data. In contrast with other machine learning
algorithms, the solutions of SRM methods are simple and depend on a relatively
small set of adjustable parameters. We collect data from 35,459 galaxies from
the EAGLE simulation using 19 redshift slices between $z=0$ and $z=4$ to
parameterize the mass evolution of the host halos. Using an appropriate
formulation of input parameters, our methodology can model satellite and
central halos using a single predictive model that achieves the same accuracy
as when predicted separately. This allows us to remove the somewhat arbitrary
distinction between those two galaxy types and model them based only on their
halo growth history. Our models can accurately reproduce the total galaxy
stellar mass function and the stellar mass-dependent galaxy correlation
functions ($\xi(r)$) of EAGLE. We show that our SRM model predictions of

  This paper presents a performance evaluation where we assess the feasibility

  To evaluate transparency, we run in the Cloud four unmodified applications:
Uber Research's Evolution Strategies, Baselines-AI's Proximal Policy

running over disaggregated resources using our library, with the single-machine
Python multiprocessing libraries in a large VM. For equal resources,
applications efficiently using message-passing abstractions achieve comparable
results despite the significant overheads of remote communication. Other
shared-memory intensive applications do not perform due to high remote memory
latency.
  The results show that Python's multiprocessing library design is an enabler
towards transparency: legacy applications using efficient disaggregated

behavior varies in time, from social interactions to biological systems. Often,
however, real-world data are prohibitively expensive to collect or unshareable
due to privacy concerns. A promising solution is `surrogate networks',
synthetic graphs with the properties of real-world networks. Until now, the
generation of realistic surrogate temporal networks has remained an open
problem, due to the difficulty of capturing both the temporal and topological
properties of the input network, as well as their correlations, in a scalable
model. Here, we propose a novel and simple method for generating surrogate
temporal networks. By decomposing graphs into temporal neighborhoods
surrounding each node, we can generate new networks using neighborhoods as
building blocks. Our model vastly outperforms current methods across multiple
examples of temporal networks in terms of both topological and dynamical
similarity. We further show that beyond generating realistic interaction
patterns, our method is able to capture intrinsic temporal periodicity of
temporal networks, all with an execution time lower than competing methods by
multiple orders of magnitude.

property inference attacks (PIAs), a privacy attack against machine learning
models. Given a trained machine learning model, PIAs aim to extract statistical
properties of its underlying training data, e.g., reveal the ratio of men and

membership inference, a lot of research on defense mechanisms has been
published, this is the first work focusing on defending against PIAs. With the
primary goal of developing a generic mitigation strategy against white-box
PIAs, we propose the novel approach property unlearning. Extensive experiments
with property unlearning show that while it is very effective when defending
target models against specific adversaries, property unlearning is not able to
generalize, i.e., protect against a whole class of PIAs. To investigate the
reasons behind this limitation, we present the results of experiments with the
explainable AI tool LIME. They show how state-of-the-art property inference
adversaries with the same objective focus on different parts of the target
model. We further elaborate on this with a follow-up experiment, in which we
use the visualization technique t-SNE to exhibit how severely statistical
training data properties are manifested in machine learning models. Based on
this, we develop the conjecture that post-training techniques like property
unlearning might not suffice to provide the desirable generic protection
against PIAs. As an alternative, we investigate the effects of simpler training
data preprocessing methods like adding Gaussian noise to images of a training

knowledge that is sufficient for a general agent that needs to solve multiple
tasks in a given world. In this work we propose world value functions (WVFs),
which are a type of general value function with mastery of the world - they
represent not only how to solve a given task, but also how to solve any other
goal-reaching task. To achieve this, we equip the agent with an internal goal
space defined as all the world states where it experiences a terminal
transition - a task outcome. The agent can then modify task rewards to define
its own reward function, which provably drives it to learn how to achieve all
achievable internal goals, and the value of doing so in the current task. We
demonstrate a number of benefits of WVFs. When the agent's internal goal space
is the entire state space, we demonstrate that the transition function can be
inferred from the learned WVF, which allows the agent to plan using learned
value functions. Additionally, we show that for tasks in the same world, a
pretrained agent that has learned any WVF can then infer the policy and value
function for any new task directly from its rewards. Finally, an important
property for long-lived agents is the ability to reuse existing knowledge to
solve new tasks. Using WVFs as the knowledge representation for learned tasks,
we show that an agent is able to solve their logical combination zero-shot,
resulting in a combinatorially increasing number of skills throughout their
lifetime.

singularities in the density of states, can considerably affect various types
of orderings in quantum materials. Regular topological transitions (of neck
formation or collapse) lead to a logarithmic divergence of the electronic
density of states (DOS) as a function of energy in two-dimensions. In addition
to the regular van-Hove singularities, there are higher order van Hove
singularities that have a power-law divergences. By employing renormalization
group techniques, we study the fate of density wave phases (spin-density and
charge-density waves) formed by the nesting of parts of the Fermi surface when
a higher order van Hove singularity (HOVHS) appears in parallel. We find that
the phase formation can be boosted by the presence of the singularity depending
on the strength of certain interactions, with the critical temperature
increasing by orders of magnitude. We discuss applications of our findings to

In particular, the motion on the faces $F_{ct}$ is analysed by means of a
transformation which reduces it to a three-directions planar random motion.
This permits us to obtain an integral representation on $F_{ct}$ in terms of
integral of products of first order Bessel functions. The investigation of the
distribution of the position $p=p(t,x,y,z)$ inside $S_{ct}$ implied the
derivation of a sixth-order partial differential equation governing $p$

the position reached by each coordinates as the motion devolpes. The analysis
is carried out when the incoming direction is orthogonal to the ongoing one and

background (DSNB) at the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO),
using the inverse-beta-decay (IBD) detection channel on free protons. We employ
the latest information on the DSNB flux predictions, and investigate in detail
the background and its reduction for the DSNB search at JUNO. The atmospheric
neutrino induced neutral current (NC) background turns out to be the most
critical background, whose uncertainty is carefully evaluated from both the
spread of model predictions and an envisaged \textit{in situ} measurement. We
also make a careful study on the background suppression with the pulse shape
discrimination (PSD) and triple coincidence (TC) cuts. With latest DSNB signal
predictions, more realistic background evaluation and PSD efficiency
optimization, and additional TC cut, JUNO can reach the significance of
3$\sigma$ for 3 years of data taking, and achieve better than 5$\sigma$ after
10 years for a reference DSNB model. In the pessimistic scenario of
non-observation, JUNO would strongly improve the limits and exclude a
significant region of the model parameter space.

After recalling the necessary and sufficient conditions obtained in [28] that
allow for the matching of two spacetimes with null embedded hypersurfaces as
boundaries, we will address the problem of matching across Killing horizons of
zero order in the case when the symmetry generators are to be identified. The
results are substantially different depending on whether the boundaries are
non-degenerate or degenerate, and contain or not fixed points (in particular,
in the former case the shells have zero pressure but non-vanishing energy
density and energy flux in general). We will present the explicit form of the
so-called step function in each situation. We will then concentrate on the case
of actual Killing horizons admitting a bifurcation surface, where a complete
description of the shell and its energy-momentum tensor can be obtained. We
will conclude particularizing to the matching of two spacetimes with spherical,
plane or hyperbolic symmetry without imposing this symmetry on the shell
itself.

community where a significant part of the user base are self-reported
supporters of QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of
elites controls global politics. QAnon is considered to have had an influential
role in the public discourse during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
However, little is known about QAnon supporters on Parler and what sets them
aside from other users. Building up on social identity theory, we aim at
profiling the characteristics of QAnon supporters on Parler. We analyze a
large-scale dataset with more than 600,000 profiles of English-speaking users
on Parler. Based on users' profiles, posts, and comments, we then extract a
comprehensive set of user features, linguistic features, network features, and
content features. This allows us to perform user profiling and understand to
what extent these features discriminate between QAnon and non-QAnon supporters
on Parler. Our analysis is three-fold: (1) We quantify the number of QAnon
supporters on Parler, finding that 34,913 users (5.5% of all users) openly
report to support the conspiracy. (2) We examine differences between QAnon vs.
non-QAnon supporters. We find that QAnon supporters differ statistically
significantly from non-QAnon supporters across multiple dimensions. For
example, they have, on average, a larger number of followers, followees, and
posts, and thus have a large impact on the Parler network. (3) We use machine
learning to identify which user characteristics discriminate QAnon from
non-QAnon supporters. We find that user features, linguistic features, network
features, and content features, can - to a large extent - discriminate QAnon
vs. non-QAnon supporters on Parler. In particular, we find that user features
are highly discriminatory, followed by content features and linguistic
features.

machine learning models amplifies biases contained in the data, leading to
unfair predictions and decision supports. Recently, multi-objective
hyperparameter optimization has been proposed to search for machine learning
models which offer equally Pareto-efficient trade-offs between accuracy and
fairness. Although these approaches proved to be more versatile than
fairness-aware machine learning algorithms -- which optimize accuracy
constrained to some threshold on fairness -- they could drastically increase
the energy consumption in the case of large datasets. In this paper we propose
FanG-HPO, a Fair and Green Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) approach based on
both multi-objective and multiple information source Bayesian optimization.
FanG-HPO uses subsets of the large dataset (aka information sources) to obtain
cheap approximations of both accuracy and fairness, and multi-objective
Bayesian Optimization to efficiently identify Pareto-efficient machine learning
models. Experiments consider two benchmark (fairness) datasets and two machine
learning algorithms (XGBoost and Multi-Layer Perceptron), and provide an
assessment of FanG-HPO against both fairness-aware machine learning algorithms
and hyperparameter optimization via a multi-objective single-source
optimization algorithm in BoTorch, a state-of-the-art platform for Bayesian

hyperspectral images (HSIs) to observe, detect and identify objects with subtle
spectral discrepancy. However, the captured HSIs may not represent true
distribution of ground objects and the received reflectance at imaging
instruments may be degraded, owing to environmental disturbances, atmospheric
effects and sensors' hardware limitations. These degradations include but are
not limited to: complex noise (i.e., Gaussian noise, impulse noise, sparse
stripes, and their mixtures), heavy stripes, deadlines, cloud and shadow
occlusion, blurring and spatial-resolution degradation and spectral absorption,
etc. These degradations dramatically reduce the quality and usefulness of HSIs.
Low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) is such an emerging technique, having
gained much attention in HSI restoration community, with ever-growing
theoretical foundation and pivotal technological innovation. Compared to
low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA), LRTA is capable of characterizing more
complex intrinsic structure of high-order data and owns more efficient learning
abilities, being established to address convex and non-convex inverse
optimization problems induced by HSI restoration. This survey mainly attempts
to present a sophisticated, cutting-edge, and comprehensive technical survey of
LRTA toward HSI restoration, specifically focusing on the following six topics:
Denoising, Destriping, Inpainting, Deblurring, Super--resolution and Fusion.
The theoretical development and variants of LRTA techniques are also
elaborated. For each topic, the state-of-the-art restoration methods are
compared by assessing their performance both quantitatively and visually. Open
issues and challenges are also presented, including model formulation,
algorithm design, prior exploration and application concerning the
interpretation requirements.

Mathematics is one such set of techniques for mental computation. However,
there is a lack of technical tools which tackle mental arithmetic concepts and
provide aid in the teaching of these topics to school students. Therefore, we
propose VedicViz, a web portal that provides dynamic visualization of
mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication and square root
calculation, based on techniques in Vedic Mathematics. The web portal also
provides visualization that enables learners to compare and contrast the mental
mathematics based approach with the traditional methods for various inputs and

the solar corona. In the limit of strongly magnetized plasma, it is typically
modeled by Spitzer's expression where the heat flux is aligned with the
magnetic field. This paper describes the implementation of the heat conduction
into the code MANCHA3D with an aim of extending single-fluid MHD simulations
from the upper convection zone into the solar corona. Two different schemes to
model heat conduction are implemented: (1) a standard scheme where a parabolic
term is added to the energy equation, and (2) a scheme where the hyperbolic
heat flux equation is solved. The first scheme limits the time step due to the
explicit integration of a parabolic term, which makes the simulations
computationally expensive. The second scheme solves the limitations on the time
step by artificially limiting the heat conduction speed to computationally
manageable values. The validation of both schemes is carried out with standard
tests in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we implement the
model for heat flux derived by Braginskii (1965) in its most general form, when
the expression for the heat flux depends on the ratio of the collisional to
cyclotron frequencies of the plasma, and, therefore on the magnetic field
strength. Additionally, our implementation takes into account the heat
conduction in parallel, perpendicular, and transverse directions, and provides
the contributions from ions and electrons separately. The model also
transitions smoothly between field-aligned conductivity and isotropic
conductivity for regions with a low or null magnetic field. Finally, we present
a two-dimensional test for heat conduction using realistic values of the solar
atmosphere where we prove the robustness of the two schemes implemented.

Without field, large-enough low-energy target shapes exhibit an optimal

optimal way to set an external field to minimize the time to reach the target,
leading to a gain of time that grows when increasing cluster size or decreasing

structures of a scene from monocular videos in a fully self-supervised fashion.
One of the most challenging aspects of this task is handling the independently
moving objects as they break the rigid-scene assumption. For the first time, we
show that pixel positional information can be exploited to learn SVDE (Single
View Depth Estimation) from videos. Our proposed moving object (MO) masks,
which are induced by shifted positional information (SPI) and referred to as
`SPIMO' masks, are very robust and consistently remove the independently moving
objects in the scenes, allowing for better learning of SVDE from videos.
Additionally, we introduce a new adaptive quantization scheme that assigns the
best per-pixel quantization curve for our depth discretization. Finally, we
employ existing boosting techniques in a new way to further self-supervise the
depth of the moving objects. With these features, our pipeline is robust
against moving objects and generalizes well to high-resolution images, even
when trained with small patches, yielding state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with
almost 8.5x fewer parameters than the previous works that learn from videos. We
present extensive experiments on KITTI and CityScapes that show the

Gupta and Sandhu proposed Activity-Centric Access Control (ACAC) and discussed
the notion of activity as a prime abstraction for access control in

considers activity decision factors such as authorizations, obligations,

a step forward and presents the core components of an ACAC model and compares
with other security models differentiating novel properties of ACAC. We
highlight how existing models do not (or in limited scope) support `active'

a hierarchical structure for a family of ACAC models by gradually adding the
properties related to notion of activity and discuss states of an activity. We

low-complexity node-based successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding has
received considerable attention for use in 5G communications systems. By
identifying special constituent codes in the decoding tree and immediately
decoding these, node-based SCL decoding provides a significant reduction in
decoding latency compared to conventional SCL decoding. However, while there
exists many types of nodes, the current node-based SCL decoders are limited by
the lack of a more generalized node that can efficiently decode a larger number
of different constituent codes to further reduce the decoding time. In this
paper, we extend a recent generalized node, the sequence repetition (SR) node
to SCL decoding and we describe the first implementation of an SR-List decoder.

  $k$-Randomized Response",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Most differentially private (DP) algorithms assume a central model in which a
reliable third party inserts noise to queries made on datasets, or a local
model where the users locally perturb their data. However, the central model is
vulnerable via a single point of failure, and in the local model, the utility
of the data deteriorates significantly. The recently proposed shuffle model is
an intermediate framework between the central and the local paradigms where the
users send their locally privatized data to a server where messages are
shuffled, effacing the link between a privatized message and the corresponding
user, giving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than the local
model, as its privacy gets amplified without adding more noise. In this paper,
we theoretically derive the strictest known bound for DP guarantee for the
shuffle models with $k$-Randomized Response local randomizers. There on, we
focus on the utility of the shuffle model for histogram queries. Leveraging on
the matrix inversion method, which is used to approximate the original
distribution from the empirical one produced by the $k$-RR mechanism, we
de-noise the histogram produced by the shuffle model to evaluate the total
variation distance of the resulting histogram from the true one, which we
regard as the measure of utility of the privacy mechanism. We perform
experiments on both synthetic and real data to compare the privacy-utility
trade-off of the shuffle model with that of the central one privatized by
adding the state-of-the-art Gaussian noise to each bin. Although the
experimental results stay consistent with the literature that favour the
central model, we see that, the difference in statistical utilities between the
central and the shuffle models is very small, showing that they are almost
comparable under the same level of DP.

which arise from magnetic fluxes ($\hbar\phi_{L} /e,~\hbar\phi_{R} /e$) through
two loops in the system. We show that when $\phi_L=\phi_R$, the probability
current is conserved. We find that the transmission across the QD can be
perfect in the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-unbroken phase (corresponding to real

an insight into this feature through a four-site toy model. We extend the model

the new vacuum imbedded in dust grains very similar to the grains present in
interstellar and intergalactic space anyway, although the presence of the
bubble with a very large homolumo gap in its single electron spectrum
influences the dust grain material so as to become denser and harder. We have
earlier explained how our dark matter particles get stopped in the shielding,
so that normally expected nucleonic collisions are not observable. The signal
of the dark matter in the underground experiments rather becomes decays of
excited particles actually with the energy of the homolumo gap, which is also
equal to the photon energy of the X-ray line presumably observed astronomically
from galaxy clusters etc. A new calculation here is a fitting of the velocity
dependence of the dark matter self-interaction as estimated by Correa [15],
using deviations from the only gravitationally interacting dark matter in dwarf
galaxies. Let us stress that apart from the speculated new vacuum we have no
new physics, and if the couplings in the Standard Model were adjusted to make
degenerate vacua as speculated according to our Multiple Point Principle (MPP)
we would only need the Standard Model, so dark matter would not require new

for real-time implementation.
  In our previous work, we considered the MU-MISO case and effectively replaced
such operations by resorting to a first-order method. Here, we consider the
more general and challenging MU-MIMO case. Our earlier approach does not
generalize to this scenario and cannot be applied to replace all the
hard-to-parallelize operations that appear in the MU-MIMO case. Thus, we
propose to leverage a reformulation of the auxiliary WMMSE function given by Hu

first variant of the WMMSE algorithm applicable to the MU-MIMO case that is
free from matrix inverses and other serial operations and hence amenable to
both real-time implementation and deep unfolding. From a theoretical viewpoint,
we establish its convergence to a stationary point of the WSR maximization
problem. From a practical viewpoint, we show that in a deep-unfolding-based
implementation, the matrix-inverse-free WMMSE algorithm attains, within a fixed

segmentation algorithm alleviates the problem of medical image annotation that
it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As a subset of weakly supervised
learning, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been proven to be effective in
segmentation. However, there is a lack of related information between instances
in MIL, which limits the further improvement of segmentation performance. In
this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised method for pixel-level
segmentation in histopathology images, which introduces Transformer into the
MIL framework to capture global or long-range dependencies. The multi-head
self-attention in the Transformer establishes the relationship between
instances, which solves the shortcoming that instances are independent of each
other in MIL. In addition, deep supervision is introduced to overcome the
limitation of annotations in weakly supervised methods and make the better
utilization of hierarchical information. The state-of-the-art results on the
colon cancer dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
compared with other weakly supervised methods. It is worth believing that there
is a potential of our approach for various applications in medical images.

SWIFT code. We launch these jets into a constant-density ICM, as well as ones
with a power-law density profile. We also vary the jet power, velocity, opening
angle and numerical resolution. In all cases we find broad agreement between
our jets and theoretical predictions for the lengths of the jets and the lobes
they inflate, as well as the radii of the lobes. The jets first evolve
ballistically, and then transition to a self-similar phase, during which the
lobes expand in a self-similar fashion (keeping a constant shape). In this
phase the kinetic and thermal energies in the lobes and in the shocked ICM are
constant fractions of the total injected energy. In our standard simulation,
two thirds of the initially injected energy is transferred to the ICM by the
time the jets are turned off, mainly through a bow shock. Of that, $70\%$ is in
kinetic form, indicating that the bow shock does not fully and efficiently
thermalise while the jet is active. At resolutions typical of large
cosmological simulations ($m_\mathrm{gas}\approx10^7$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), the
shape of the lobes is close to self-similar predictions to an accuracy of
$15\%$. This indicates that the basic physics of jet-inflated lobes can be
correctly simulated even at such resolutions ($\approx500$ particles per jet).

architecture includes a novel point transformation generator that learns to
project randomly generated point co-ordinates into meaningful synthetic
co-ordinates that capture both microscopic (e.g., junctions, squares) and
macroscopic (e.g., parks, lakes) geographic features. We provide our privacy
guarantees through label local differential privacy, which is more practical
than traditional local differential privacy. We seamlessly integrate this level
of privacy into GeoPointGAN by augmenting the discriminator to the point level
and implementing a randomized response-based mechanism that flips the labels
associated with the 'real' and 'fake' points used in training. Extensive
experiments show that GeoPointGAN significantly outperforms recent solutions,
improving by up to 10 times compared to the most competitive baseline. We also
evaluate GeoPointGAN using range, hotspot, and facility location queries, which
confirm the practical effectiveness of GeoPointGAN for privacy-preserving

Classification of Diseases (ICD) to identify patients with diseases from
Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, due to the lack of detail and

ICD codes often cannot characterise patients accurately for specific diseases
in real clinical practice, and as a result, using them to find patients for
studies or trials can result in high failure rates and missing out on uncoded
patients. Manual inspection of all patients at scale is not feasible as it is
highly costly and slow.
  This paper proposes a scalable workflow which leverages both structured data
and unstructured textual notes from EHRs with techniques including NLP, AutoML
and Clinician-in-the-Loop mechanism to build machine learning classifiers to
identify patients at scale with given diseases, especially those who might
currently be miscoded or missed by ICD codes.

the ultrafast dynamics of exciton-polaritons based on strongly-coupled (6,5)

how to exploit the IRS to approach such a performance upper bound. To answer
this question, we aim to maximize the total harvested energy of a multiuser WET

historical information, uses Fourier projection to remove noise, and adds a
low-rank approximation to speed up computation. Our empirical studies show that
the proposed FiLM significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art
models in multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting by

between the magnetized stellar wind with a planetary atmospheric outflow for
ambient stellar wind conditions and Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) conditions. We
also calculate synthetic Ly$\alpha$ absorption due to neutral hydrogen in the
ambient and the escaping planetary atmosphere affected by this interaction. We
find that the Ly$\alpha$ absorption is highly variable due to the
highly-varying stellar wind conditions. A strong Doppler blue-shift component
is observed in the Ly$\alpha$ profile, in contradiction to the actual escape
velocity observed in the simulations themselves. This result suggest that the
strong Doppler blue-shift is likely attributed to the stellar wind, not the
escaping neutral atmosphere, either through its advection of neutral planetary
gas, or through the creation of a fast neutral flow via charge exchange between
the stellar wind ions and the planetary neutrals. Indeed, our CME simulations
indicate a strong stripping of magnetospheric material from the planet,
including some of the neutral escaping atmosphere. Our simulations show that
the pressure around close-in exoplanets is not much lower, and may be even
higher, than the pressure at the top of the planetary atmosphere. Thus, the
neutral atmosphere is hydrodynamically escaping with a very small velocity
($<15~km~s^{-1}$). Moreover, our simulations show that an MHD treatment is
essential in order to properly capture the coupled magnetized stellar wind and
the escaping atmosphere, despite of the atmosphere being neutral. This coupling
should be considered when interpreting Ly$\alpha$observations in the context of
exoplanets atmospheric escape.

phase-space) of Milky Way stars. Where available, spectroscopic radial velocity
(RV) measurements provide full 6D phase-space information, however there are
now and will remain many stars without RV measurements. Without an RV it is not
possible to directly calculate 3D stellar velocities, however one can infer 3D
stellar velocities by marginalizing over the missing RV dimension. In this
paper, we infer the 3D velocities of stars in the Kepler field in Cartesian
Galactocentric coordinates (vx, vy, vz). We directly calculate velocities for
around a quarter of all Kepler targets, using RV measurements available from
the Gaia, LAMOST and APOGEE spectroscopic surveys. Using the velocity
distributions of these stars as our prior, we infer velocities for the
remaining three-quarters of the sample by marginalizing over the RV dimension.
The median uncertainties on our inferred vx, vy, and vz velocities are around
4, 18, and 4 km/s, respectively. We provide 3D velocities for a total of
148,590 stars in the Kepler field. These 3D velocities could enable kinematic
age-dating, Milky Way stellar population studies, and other scientific studies
using the benchmark sample of well-studied Kepler stars. Although the
methodology used here is broadly applicable to targets across the sky, our
prior is specifically constructed from and for the Kepler field. Care should be
taken to use a suitable prior when extending this method to other parts of the
Galaxy.

based on non-spatial descriptions in which space is homogenised and parasite

epidemic transmission is conditioned by the spatial distribution of hosts and
the parasites mobility patterns, calling for a explicit description of space.
In this work we develop a spatially-explicit individual-based model to study
disease transmission by waterborne parasites in sessile marine populations. We
investigate the impact of spatial disease transmission through extensive
numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Specifically, the effects of
parasite mobility into the epidemic threshold and the temporal progression of
the epidemic are assessed. We show that larger values of pathogen mobility
imply more severe epidemics, as the number of infections increases, and shorter
time-scales to extinction. An analytical expression for the basic reproduction
number of the spatial model is derived as function of the non-spatial

clusters are formed, the feedback of which disperses and unbinds the dense gas
through expanding HII regions and supernova (SN) explosions. For galaxies with
properties similar to the modelled ones, we find that the [CII] emission
remains optically thin throughout the merging process. We identify the Warm
Neutral Medium ($3<\log T_{\rm gas}<4$ with $\chi_{\rm HI}>2\chi_{\rm H2}$) to
be the primary source of [CII] emission ($\sim58\%$ contribution), although at
stages when the HII regions are young and dense (during star cluster formation
or SNe in the form of ionized bubbles) they can contribute $\gtrsim50\%$ to the
total [CII] emission. We find that the [CII]/FIR ratio decreases due to thermal
saturation of the [CII] emission caused by strong FUV radiation fields emitted
by the massive star clusters, leading to a [CII]-deficit medium. We investigate
the [CII]-SFR relation and find an approximately linear correlation which
agrees well with observations, particularly those from the Dwarf Galaxy Survey.
Our simulation reproduces the observed trends of [CII]/FIR versus $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm FIR}$, and it agrees well with the Kennicutt relation of
SFR-FIR luminosity. We propose that local peaks of [CII] in resolved
observations may provide evidence for ongoing massive cluster formation.

scene visualization, human-computer interaction, and various downstream
applications. Despite the recent advances in computer graphics and
photogrammetry technology, generating novel views is still challenging
particularly for remote sensing images due to its high complexity, view
sparsity and limited view-perspective variations. In this paper, we propose a
novel remote sensing view synthesis method by leveraging the recent advances in
implicit neural representations. Considering the overhead and far depth imaging
of remote sensing images, we represent the 3D space by combining implicit
multiplane images (MPI) representation and deep neural networks. The 3D scene
is reconstructed under a self-supervised optimization paradigm through a
differentiable multiplane renderer with multi-view input constraints. Images
from any novel views thus can be freely rendered on the basis of the
reconstructed model. As a by-product, the depth maps corresponding to the given
viewpoint can be generated along with the rendering output. We refer to our
method as Implicit Multiplane Images (ImMPI). To further improve the view
synthesis under sparse-view inputs, we explore the learning-based
initialization of remote sensing 3D scenes and proposed a neural network based
Prior extractor to accelerate the optimization process. In addition, we propose
a new dataset for remote sensing novel view synthesis with multi-view
real-world google earth images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the ImMPI over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of
reconstruction accuracy, visual fidelity, and time efficiency. Ablation
experiments also suggest the effectiveness of our methodology design. Our

for markets with myopic, risk-averse traders who repeatedly interact with the
market maker. We show that the resulting limiting wealth distribution lies on
the Pareto efficient frontier defined by all market participants' utilities.
With the help of this result, we establish both analytical and numerical
results for the limiting price for different market models. We show that the
limiting price converges to the geometric mean of agents' beliefs for
exponential utility-based markets. For risk measure-based markets, we construct
a risk measure family that meets the convergence requirements and show that the
limiting price can converge to a weighted power mean of agent beliefs. For
markets based on hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utilities, we show
that the limiting price is also a risk-adjusted weighted power mean of agent
beliefs, even though the trading order will affect the aggregation weights. We
further propose an approximation scheme for the limiting price under the HARA
utility family. We show through numerical experiments that our approximation
scheme works well in predicting the convergent prices.

we study monoidal width in a category of matrices, and in an extension to a
different monoidal category of open graphs, where the connectivity information
is handled with matrix algebra and graphs are composed along edges instead of
vertices. We show that here monoidal width captures rank width: a measure of
graph complexity that has received much attention in recent years.

this equivalence, the simple $A$-modules correspond exactly to the

the shape of the shadow becomes more deformed. In particular, by comparing with
the shadow of Bardeen black hole and Hayward black hole with the same values of

logic may hang on the choice of proof formalism, on the shape of the logical

underlying notion of consequence, and even on the expressiveness of its
linguistic resources and on the logical framework into which it is embedded.
Standard (one-dimensional) logics determined by (non-deterministic) logical
matrices are known to be axiomatizable by analytic and possibly finite proof
systems as soon as they turn out to satisfy a certain constraint of sufficient
expressiveness. In this paper we introduce a recipe for cooking up a
two-dimensional logical matrix (or B-matrix) by the combination of two
(possibly partial) non-deterministic logical matrices. We will show that such a
combination may result in B-matrices satisfying the property of sufficient
expressiveness, even when the input matrices are not sufficiently expressive in
isolation, and we will use this result to show that one-dimensional logics that
are not finitely axiomatizable may inhabit finitely axiomatizable
two-dimensional logics, becoming, thus, finitely axiomatizable by the addition
of an extra dimension. We will illustrate the said construction using a
well-known logic of formal inconsistency called mCi. We will first prove that
this logic is not finitely axiomatizable by a one-dimensional (generalized)
Hilbert-style system. Then, taking advantage of a known 5-valued
non-deterministic logical matrix for this logic, we will combine it with
another one, conveniently chosen so as to give rise to a B-matrix that is
axiomatized by a two-dimensional Hilbert-style system that is both finite and
analytic.

models are often created that characterize different aspects of that system.
Often, a model at one level will produce a prediction which is contradictory at

than aiming to build a single unified model of a complex system, the modeller
acknowledges the infinity of ways of capturing the system of interest, while
offering their own specific insight. We refer to this pragmatic applied
approach to complex systems -- one which acknowledges that they are
incompressible, dynamic, nonlinear, historical, contextual, and value-laden --
as Open Machine Learning (Open ML). In this paper we define Open ML and
contrast it with some of the grand narratives of ML of two forms: 1) Closed ML,
ML which emphasizes learning with minimal human input (e.g. Google's AlphaZero)
and 2) Partially Open ML, ML which is used to parameterize existing models. To
achieve this, we use theories of critical complexity to both evaluate these
grand narratives and contrast them with the Open ML approach. Specifically, we
deconstruct grand ML `theories' by identifying thirteen 'games' played in the
ML community. These games lend false legitimacy to models, contribute to
over-promise and hype about the capabilities of artificial intelligence, reduce
wider participation in the subject, lead to models that exacerbate inequality
and cause discrimination and ultimately stifle creativity in research. We argue
that best practice in ML should be more consistent with critical complexity
perspectives than with rationalist, grand narratives.

In

swimming in search for females, and approaching them for mating once they are

approaching for encounter supports attraction. Thus, we ask whether these
competing mechanisms of diffusion and attraction can support aggregation and
lead to the formation of mating clusters. To answer our question we formulate a
model in which particles performing random walks can briefly make contact with
other particles if they are found within a particular distance from each other.
Our analysis shows that this model supports clustering in a way analogous to
the process of colloid aggregation. Following that, we analyze a dataset of 3D
trajectories of swimming copepods and show that the results compare well with
our model. These results support the hypothesis that pair-interactions promote
mating aggregates in zooplankton and are sufficient to overcome the diffusive
nature of their mate searching behavior. Our results are useful for
understanding small-scale clustering of zooplankton, which is crucial for
predicting encounter rates and reproduction rates in the ocean.

absorbing media has recently been developed in terms of an encounter-based
approach. The latter computes the joint probability density (generalized
propagator) for particle position $\X_t$ and a Brownian functional ${\mathcal
U}_t$ that specifies the amount of time the particle is in contact with a
reactive component $\calM$. Absorption occurs as soon as $\calU_t$ crosses a
randomly distributed threshold (stopping time). Laplace transforming the
propagator with respect to $\calU_t$ leads to a classical boundary value
problem (BVP) in which the reactive component has a constant rate of absorption
$z$, where $z$ is the corresponding Laplace variable. Hence, a crucial step in
the encounter-based approach is finding the inverse Laplace transform. In the
case of a reactive boundary $\partial \calM$, this can be achieved by solving a
classical Robin BVP in terms of the spectral decomposition of a
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. In this paper we develop the analogous
construction in the case of a reactive substrate $\calM$. In particular, we
show that the Laplace transformed propagator can be computed in terms of the
spectral decomposition of a pair of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. However,
inverting the Laplace transform with respect to $z$ is more involved. We
illustrate the theory by considering a 1D example where the

framework for studying diffusion-mediated surface reactions. The basic idea of
the probabilistic approach is to consider the joint probability density or
generalized propagator for particle position and the so-called boundary local
time. The latter characterizes the amount of time that a Brownian particle
spends in the neighborhood of a totally reflecting boundary; the effects of
surface reactions are then incorporated via an appropriate stopping condition
for the local time. The propagator is determined by solving a Robin boundary
value problem, in which the constant rate of reactivity is identified as the
Laplace variable $z$ conjugate to the local time, and then inverting the
solution with respect to $z$. Here we reinterpret the propagator as a particle
concentration in which surface absorption is counterbalanced by particle source
terms. We investigate conditions under which there exists a non-trivial steady
state solution, and analyze the relaxation to steady state by calculating the
corresponding accumulation time. In particular, we show that the first two
moments of the stopping local time density have to be finite.

(SDDP), approximate the value function by adding linear subgradient cuts at

nonlinear problems may suffer from the increasing size of each subproblem as
the iteration proceeds. On the other hand, VFGL has a fixed number of

iteration. Furthermore, VFGL can learn the parameters by means of stochastic
gradient descent, which means that it can be easily parallelized and does not

of the unique (up to scaling) radial positive solution $U_{\lambda,\alpha}$ to
the weighted fourth-order Hardy (for $\alpha>0$) or H\'{e}non (for $\alpha<0$)

  \end{equation*} %Furthermore, we characterize all the solutions to the
linearized problem related to above equation at $U_{1,\alpha}$. For $\alpha\neq
0$, it is known the solutions of above equation are invariant for dilations
$\lambda^{\frac{N-4+\alpha}{2}}u(\lambda x)$ but not for translations. However
we show that if $\alpha$ is an even integer, there exist new solutions to the
linearized problem, which related to above equation at $U_{1,\alpha}$, that
""replace"" the ones due to the translations invariance. This interesting
phenomenon was first shown by Gladiali, Grossi and Neves [Adv. Math. 249, 2013,
1-36] for the second-order H\'{e}non problem. Finally, as applications, we
investigate the reminder term of above inequality and also the existence of
solutions to some related perturbed equations.

usually requires 3f + 1 nodes to tolerate f faulty replicas. Due to their high
throughput and finality property BFT algorithms build the core of recent
permissioned blockchains. As a complex and resource-demanding infrastructure,
multiple cloud providers have started offering Blockchain-as-a-Service. This
eases the deployment of permissioned blockchains but places the cloud provider
in a central controlling position, thereby questioning blockchains' fault
tolerance and decentralization properties and their underlying BFT algorithm.
This paper presents SplitBFT, a new way to utilize trusted execution technology
(TEEs), such as Intel SGX, to harden the safety and confidentiality guarantees
of BFT systems thereby strengthening the trust in could-based deployments of
permissioned blockchains. Deviating from standard assumptions, SplitBFT
acknowledges that code protected by trusted execution may fail. We address this
by splitting and isolating the core logic of BFT protocols into multiple
compartments resulting in a more resilient architecture. We apply SplitBFT to
the traditional practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT) and
evaluate it using SGX. Our results show that SplitBFT adds only a reasonable
overhead compared to the non-compartmentalized variant.

two research questions more specifically. First, is a metaphorically-perceived
discourse more abstract and more emotional in comparison to a
literally-perceived discourse? Second, is a metaphorical expression preceded by
a more metaphorical/abstract/emotional context than a synonymous literal
alternative? We used a dataset of 1,000 corpus-extracted discourses for which
crowdsourced annotators (1) provided judgements on whether they perceived the
discourses as more metaphorical or more literal, and (2) systematically listed
lexical terms which triggered their decisions in (1). Our results indicate that
metaphorical discourses are more emotional and to a certain extent more
abstract than literal discourses. However, neither the metaphoricity nor the
abstractness and emotionality of the preceding discourse seem to play a role in
triggering the choice between synonymous metaphorical vs. literal expressions.

extremely large-scale calculations on massively parallel platforms,
implementing both exact and linear scaling solvers for the ground state. It
uses local basis sets (both pseudo-atomic orbitals, PAOs, and systematically
convergent B-splines) and sparse matrix storage and operations to ensure
locality in all aspects of the calculation. Using exact diagonalisation
approaches and a full PAO basis set, systems of up to 1,000 atoms can be
modelled with relatively modest resources (200-500 cores), while use of
multi-site support functions (MSSF) enable calculations of up to 10,000 atoms
with similar resources. With linear scaling, the code demonstrates essentially
perfect weak scaling (fixed atoms per process), and has been applied to over
1,000,000 atoms, scaling to nearly 200,000 cores; it has been run on both the K
computer and Fugaku, among other computers. CONQUEST calculates the total
energy, forces and stresses exactly, and allows structural optimisation of both
ions and simulation cell. Molecular dynamics calculations within the NVE, NVT
and NPT ensembles are possible with both exact diagonalisation and linear
scaling[6]. The code interfaces with LibXC to implement LDA and GGA
functionals, with metaGGA and hybrid functionals under development. Dispersion
interactions can be included using semi-empirical methods (DFT-D2/3, TS) and
vdW-DF. The polarisation can be calculated using Resta's approach.

the difficulty in obtaining the large sets of labelled data to train ML

(SsL) methods, which combine small labelled datasets with large amounts of
unlabelled data.
  This paper is aimed at systematization of existing work on SsL for CTD and,
in particular, on understanding the utility of unlabelled data in such systems.
To this end, we analyze the cost of labelling in various CTD tasks and develop
a formal cost model for SsL in this context. Building on this foundation, we
formalize a set of requirements for evaluation of SsL methods, which elucidates
the contribution of unlabelled data. We review the state-of-the-art and observe
that no previous work meets such requirements. To address this problem, we
propose a framework for assessing the benefits of unlabelled data in SsL. We
showcase an application of this framework by performing the first benchmark
evaluation that highlights the tradeoffs of 9 existing SsL methods on 9 public

small, but statistically significant, performance gain. This paper highlights
that SsL in CTD has a lot of room for improvement, which should stimulate

switch a grasp type (six total) for a prosthetic hand by gazing at a

individual module, into the i-MYO system. In the i-MYO system, the myoelectric
signal was used to control hand opening /closing proportionally. The operation
of the i-MYO was tested on nine healthy subjects who wore HIT-V hand on the
forearm and manipulated objects in a reach-and-grasp task. It was also tested
on one patient who had an inferior myoelectric signal and was required to
control the HIT-V hand to grasp objects. Results showed that in 91.6% of the
trials, inexperienced healthy subjects accomplished the task within 5.9 s, and
most failed trials were caused by a lack of experience in fine grasping. In
addition, in about 1.5% of trials, the subjects also successfully transferred
the objects but with a non-optimal grasp type. In 97.0% of the trials, the
subjects spent ~1.3 s switching the optimal grasp types. A higher success rate
in grasp type (99.1%) for the untrained patient has been observed thanks to
more trials conducted. In 98.7 % of trials, the patient only needed another 2 s
to control the hand to grasp the object after switching to the optimal grasp
type. The tests demonstrate the control capability of the new system in
multi-DOF prosthetics, and all inexperienced subjects were able to master the

foregrounds and backgrounds in optical remote sensing images (RSIs), the
salient object detection (SOD) for optical RSIs becomes a huge challenge.
However, different from natural scene images (NSIs), the discussion on the
optical RSI SOD task still remains scarce. In this paper, we propose a
multi-scale context network, namely MSCNet, for SOD in optical RSIs.
Specifically, a multi-scale context extraction module is adopted to address the
scale variation of salient objects by effectively learning multi-scale
contextual information. Meanwhile, in order to accurately detect complete
salient objects in complex backgrounds, we design an attention-based pyramid
feature aggregation mechanism for gradually aggregating and refining the
salient regions from the multi-scale context extraction module. Extensive
experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that MSCNet achieves competitive
performance with only 3.26M parameters. The code will be available at
https://github.com/NuaaYH/MSCNet.

  ""International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC), Bamberg,
  2022""",,,,"eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A popular approach for 3D source localization using multiple microphones is
the steered-response power method, where the source position is directly
estimated by maximizing a function of three continuous position variables.
Instead of directly estimating the source position, in this paper we propose an
indirect, distance-based method for 3D source localization. Based on properties
of Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs), we reformulate the 3D source
localization problem as the minimization of a cost function of a single
variable, namely the distance between the source and the reference microphone.
Using the known microphone geometry and estimated time-differences of arrival
(TDOAs) between the microphones, we show how the 3D source position can be
computed based on this variable. In addition, instead of using a single TDOA
estimate per microphone pair, we propose an extension that enables to select
the most appropriate estimate from a set of candidate TDOA estimates, which is
especially relevant in reverberant environments with strong early reflections.
Experimental results for different source and microphone constellations show
that the proposed EDM-based method consistently outperforms the
steered-response power method, especially when the source is close to the
microphones.

sustaining the job of modelling physical systems through inference. In order to
solve the inference problem, the data should satisfy certain conditions that
depend also upon the particular questions addressed in a research. Here we
focus on the characterization of systems in terms of a distance from
equilibrium, typically the entropy production (time-reversal asymmetry) or the
violation of the Kubo fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show how general,
counter-intuitive and negative for inference, is the problem of the
impossibility to estimate the distance from equilibrium using a series of
scalar data which have a Gaussian statistics. This impossibility occurs also
when the data are correlated in time, and that is the most interesting case
because it usually stems from a multi-dimensional linear Markovian system where
there are many time-scales associated to different variables and, possibly,
thermal baths. Observing a single variable (or a linear combination of
variables) results in a one-dimensional process which is always
indistinguishable from an equilibrium one (unless a perturbation-response
experiment is available). In a setting where only data analysis (and not new
experiments) is allowed, we propose - as a way out - the combined use of
different series of data acquired with different parameters. This strategy
works when there is a sufficient knowledge of the connection between
experimental parameters and model parameters. We also briefly discuss how such
results emerge, similarly, in the context of Markov chains within certain
coarse-graining schemes. Our conclusion is that the distance from equilibrium
is related to quite a fine knowledge of the full phase space, and therefore
typically hard to approximate in real experiments.

methods and AI, and combined modelling of systems with data has gained
increasing importance in applications such as business process management. In
addition, process mining techniques are nowadays used to automatically mine
process models from event data, often without correctness guarantees. Thus
verification techniques for linear and branching time properties are needed to
ensure desired behavior. Here we consider data-aware dynamic systems with
arithmetic (DDSAs), which constitute a concise but expressive formalism of
transition systems with linear arithmetic guards. We present a CTL* model
checking procedure for DDSAs that relies on a finite-state abstraction by means
of a set of formulas that capture variable configurations. Linear-time
verification was shown to be decidable in specific classes of DDSAs where the
constraint language or the control flow are suitably confined. We investigate
several of these restrictions for the case of CTL*, with both positive and
negative results: CTL* verification is proven decidable for monotonicity and
integer periodicity constraint systems, but undecidable for feedback free and
bounded lookback systems. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we
implemented it in the SMT-based prototype ada, showing that many practical
business process models can be effectively analyzed.

and multilayer feedforward neural networks. The high-dimensional sparse

methods have a rather obvious problem, that is, the features directly input are
treated as independent individuals, and in fact there are internal correlations
between features and features, and even different features have different
importance in the recommendation. In this regard, this paper adopts a
self-attentive mechanism to mine the internal correlations between features as
well as their relative importance. In recent years, as a special form of
attention mechanism, self-attention mechanism is favored by many researchers.
The self-attentive mechanism captures the internal correlation of data or

Therefore, this paper adopts a multi-headed self-attentive mechanism to mine
the internal correlations between features and thus learn the internal
representation of features. At the same time, considering the rich information
often hidden between features, the new feature representation obtained by
crossover between the two is likely to imply the new description of the user

is a problem of limited expression of feature combinations. Therefore, this

binaural noise reduction algorithms for head-mounted assistive listening
devices are of crucial importance. Several binaural noise reduction algorithms
such as the well-known binaural minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)
beamformer have been proposed, which exploit spatial correlations of both the
target speech and the noise components. Furthermore, for single-microphone
scenarios, multi-frame algorithms such as the multi-frame MVDR (MFMVDR) filter
have been proposed, which exploit temporal instead of spatial correlations. In
this contribution, we propose a binaural extension of the MFMVDR filter, which
exploits both spatial and temporal correlations. The binaural MFMVDR filters
are embedded in an end-to-end deep learning framework, where the required
parameters, i.e., the speech spatio-temporal correlation vectors as well as the
(inverse) noise spatio-temporal covariance matrix, are estimated by temporal
convolutional networks (TCNs) that are trained by minimizing the mean spectral
absolute error loss function. Simulation results comprising measured binaural
room impulses and diverse noise sources at signal-to-noise ratios from -5 dB to
20 dB demonstrate the advantage of utilizing the binaural MFMVDR filter
structure over directly estimating the binaural multi-frame filter coefficients
with TCNs.

hinder radiation pressure and currently observed time-averaged forces. This
constitutes a novel paradigm of the mechanical efficiency of light on matter,
and completes the landscape of the electromagnetic force in classical
electrodynamics; widening our understanding in the design of both illumination
and particles in optical manipulation without the need of increasing the
illuminating power, and thus lowering dissipation and heating. We show that
this may be accomplished through the minimization of what we establish as the
reactive strength of canonical (i.e. orbital) momentum, which plays against the
optical force a role analogous to that of the reactive power versus the
radiation efficiency of an antenna. This long time overlooked quantity,
important for current progress of optical manipulation, and that stems from the
complex Maxwell theorem of conservation of complex momentum that we put
forward, as well as its alternating flow associated to the imaginary part of
the complex Maxwell stress tensor, conform the imaginary Lorentz force that we
introduce in this work, and that like the reactive strength of orbital
momentum, is antagonic to the well-known time-averaged force; thus making this
reactive Lorentz force indirectly observable near wavelengths at which the

high-frequency information -- through the encoding of coordinate positions as
an array of Fourier features. Hitherto, the rationale for the effectiveness of
these positional encodings has been mainly studied through a Fourier lens. In
this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing that alternative
non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for positional encoding.
Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely determined by a trade-off
between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and the distance preservation
between embedded coordinates. We further establish that the now ubiquitous
Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case that fulfills these
conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory to analyze
positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. In addition, we argue
that employing a more complex positional encoding -- that scales exponentially
with the number of modes -- requires only a linear (rather than deep)
coordinate function to achieve comparable performance. Counter-intuitively, we
demonstrate that trading positional embedding complexity for network deepness
is orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art; despite the
additional embedding complexity. To this end, we develop the necessary
theoretical formulae and empirically verify that our theoretical claims hold in
practice.

tomography with generalised measurements is both more general and simpler than
the traditional formulation with randomisation of unitaries. In particular,
this formulation allows us to analyse theoretical aspects of shadow tomography
in detail. For example, we provide a detailed study of the implication of

orbital coupling and splitting of valence and conduction band edges. Therefore,
the WS2/SiO2 heterostructure has a Type I energy-band alignment. The band
offsets obtained experimentally and theoretically are consistent except the
narrower theoretical bandgap of SiO2. The theoretical calculations further
reveal a binding energy of 75 meV per S atom and the totally separated partial

sample variance of $B$-modes produced at later times by gravitational lensing.
Constraints can be improved by `delensing': using some proxy of the matter
distribution to partially remove the lensing-induced $B$-modes. Current and
soon-upcoming experiments will infer a matter map -- at least in part -- from
the temperature anisotropies of the CMB. These reconstructions are contaminated
by extragalactic foregrounds: radio-emitting galaxies, the cosmic infrared
background, or the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effects. Using the Websky simulations,
we show that the foregrounds add spurious power to the angular auto-spectrum of
delensed $B$-modes via non-Gaussian higher-point functions, biasing constraints
on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. We consider an idealized experiment similar
to the Simons Observatory, with no Galactic or atmospheric foregrounds. After
removing point sources detectable at 143 GHz and reconstructing lensing from
CMB temperature modes $l<3500$ using a Hu-Okamoto quadratic estimator (QE), we
infer a value of $r$ that is $1.5\,\sigma$ higher than the true $r=0$.
Reconstructing instead from a minimum-variance ILC map only exacerbates the
problem, bringing the bias above $3\,\sigma$. When the $TT$ estimator is
co-added with other QEs or with external matter tracers, new couplings ensue
which partially cancel the diluted bias from $TT$. We provide a simple and
effective prescription to model these effects. In addition, we demonstrate that
the point-source-hardened or shear-only QEs can not only mitigate the biases to
acceptable levels, but also lead to lower power than the Hu-Okamoto QE after
delensing. Thus, temperature-based reconstructions remain powerful tools in the
quest to measure $r$.

characteristics, and whose spatial distribution is crucial to understand
inequalities in life expectancy or education level. Traditional studies on
spatial segregation indicators focus often on first-neighbour correlations but
fail to capture complex multi-scale patterns. In this work, we aim at
characterizing the spatial distribution heterogeneity of socioeconomic features
through diffusion and synchronization dynamics. In particular, we use the time
needed to reach the synchronization as a proxy for the spatial heterogeneity of
a socioeconomic feature, as for example, the income. Our analysis for 16~income
categories in cities from the United States reveals that the spatial
distribution of the most deprived and affluent citizens leads to higher
diffusion and synchronization times. By measuring the time needed for a
neighborhood to reach the global phase we are able to detect those that suffer
from a steeper segregation. Overall, the present manuscript exemplifies how
diffusion and synchronization dynamics can be used to assess the heterogeneity
in the presence of node information.

assuming that only the mean of the value distribution and an upper bound on the
bidder values are known. We seek the mechanism that maximizes revenue over the
worst-case distribution compatible with the known parameters. Such a mechanism
arises as an equilibrium of a zero-sum game between the seller and an adversary
who chooses the distribution, and so can be referred to as the max-min
mechanism.
  Carrasco et al. [2018] derive the max-min pricing when the seller faces a
single bidder for the item. We go from max-min pricing to max-min auctions by
studying the canonical setting of two i.i.d. bidders, and show the max-min
mechanism is the second-price auction with a randomized reserve. We derive a
closed-form solution for the distribution over reserve prices, as well as the
worst-case value distribution, for which there is simple economic intuition. In
fact we derive a closed-form solution for the reserve price distribution for
any number of bidders.
  Our technique for solving the zero-sum game is quite different than that of
Carrasco et al.- it involves analyzing a discretized version of the setting,
then refining the discretization grid and deriving a closed-form solution for
the non-discretized, original setting. Our results establish a difference
between the case of two bidders and that of $n \ge 3$ bidders.

Entanglement (GIE) experiments, surveyed here. The hypothesized outcomes of the

ultimately arguing that the positive claim of witness is equivocal. Despite
various sweeping arguments to the contrary in the vicinity of quantum

claim to witness the quantum nature of the gravitational field in these
experiments decisively depends on which out of two legitimate modelling
paradigms one finds oneself in. However, by situating GIE experiments in a
tradition of existing experiments aimed at making gravity interestingly quantum

there are powerful reasons to perform the experiments, and that their
successful undertaking would indeed be a major advance in physics.

The choice of $R_{a}, R_{b}$ renders four different quantum mechanical systems.
In hydrogenic atom, they are termed as (a) free hydrogen atom (FHA) (b)

incidental degeneracy concept is further explored and analyzed in certain
well-known \emph{plasma} (Debye and exponential cosine screened) systems.

  Proof-of-Work Consensus",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Many existing timed-release encryption schemes uses time-lock puzzles to
avoid relying on a trusted timeserver or a key holder which could be a weak
spot in data security. However, it is unavoidable to consume massive computing
power for solving time-lock puzzles and it is difficult for encryptors to
predict the amount of time to solve a puzzle by decryptors. In this study, an
efficient dual-purpose proof-of-work consensus allows users to release a
time-locked content, which is encrypted by an asymmetric key encryption scheme
on a blockchain, without trust in any third-party agents. The release time is
predictable as the block time in a proof-of-work blockchain is adaptively
controlled. The mining work is reproposed so that once a new block was mined on
the blockchain network, time-lock puzzles were also solved immediately. No
additional work is required to reveal the time-locked contents and the
encryption is secured by monetary incentive mechanisms since it would be very
costly to arrange an attack attempt, which must overtake the total hash rate of
the whole blockchain network.

method in classification of intents when detection of out-of-scope (OOS) inputs

improvements in OOS detection when the intent classes are represented as
dense-vectors based on domain specific knowledge, we argue in this paper that
such gains are more likely due to advantages of dense-vector to one-hot
encoding methods in representing the complexity of the OOS space. We start by
showing how dense-vector encodings can create OOS spaces with much richer
topologies than one-hot encoding methods. We then demonstrate empirically,
using four standard intent classification datasets, that knowledge-free,
randomly generated dense-vector encodings of intent classes can yield massive,
over 20% gains over one-hot encodings, and also outperform the previous, domain
knowledge-based, SOTA of one of the datasets. We finish by describing a novel
algorithm to search for good dense-vector encodings and present initial but
promising experimental results of its use.

exploiting the adjugate matrix of the characteristic equation of a related
eigenvalue problem to obtain the manifold of the space of a quaternion
eigenvector. We argue that quaternions parameterized by their corresponding
rotation matrices cannot be expressed, for example, in machine learning tasks,
as single-valued functions: the quaternion solution must instead be treated as
a manifold, with different algebraic solutions for each of several
single-valued sectors represented by the adjugate matrix. We conclude with
novel constructions exploiting the quaternion adjugate variables to revisit
several classic pose estimation applications: 2D point-cloud matching, 2D
point-cloud-to-projection matching, 3D point-cloud matching, 3D orthographic

Mixup Experience Replay (NMER), a geometrically-grounded replay buffer that
interpolates transitions with their closest neighbors in state-action space.
NMER preserves a locally linear approximation of the transition manifold by
only applying Mixup between transitions with vicinal state-action features.
Under NMER, a given transition's set of state action neighbors is dynamic and
episode agnostic, in turn encouraging greater policy generalizability via
inter-episode interpolation. We combine our approach with recent off-policy
deep reinforcement learning algorithms and evaluate on continuous control
environments. We observe that NMER improves sample efficiency by an average 94%

effectively recombine previous experiences and learn from limited data.

applications because they significantly reduce the consumption of both memory

computationally efficient as they require only one bit per weight and
activation and can be computed using Boolean logic and bit count operations.
QNNs with ternary weights and activations and binary weights and ternary
activations aim to improve recognition quality compared to BNNs while
preserving low bit-width. However, their efficient implementation is usually
considered on ASICs and FPGAs, limiting their applicability in real-life tasks.
At the same time, one of the areas where efficient recognition is most in
demand is recognition on mobile devices using their CPUs. However, there are no
known fast implementations of TBNs and TNN, only the daBNN library for BNNs
inference. In this paper, we propose novel fast algorithms of ternary,
ternary-binary, and binary matrix multiplication for mobile devices with ARM
architecture. In our algorithms, ternary weights are represented using 2-bit
encoding and binary - using one bit. It allows us to replace matrix
multiplication with Boolean logic operations that can be computed on 128-bits
simultaneously, using ARM NEON SIMD extension. The matrix multiplication
results are accumulated in 16-bit integer registers. We also use special
reordering of values in left and right matrices. All that allows us to
efficiently compute a matrix product while minimizing the number of loads and
stores compared to the algorithm from daBNN. Our algorithms can be used to
implement inference of convolutional and fully connected layers of TNNs, TBNs,
and BNNs. We evaluate them experimentally on ARM Cortex-A73 CPU and compare
their inference speed to efficient implementations of full-precision, 8-bit,

partially trained models, the distributed roadside units (a) perform downlink
multicast beamforming to minimize global model distribution delay and (b)
allocate optimal uplink radio resources to minimize local model offloading
delay, and the vehicle agents conduct heterogeneous local model training. Using
real-world vehicle trace datasets, we validate our FL solutions. Simulation

satisfy all constraints and deliver near ground truth multi-horizon velocity

robustness of the review framework for knowledge distillation introduced in the
CVPR '21 paper 'Distilling Knowledge via Knowledge Review' by Chen et al.
Previous works in knowledge distillation only studied connections paths between
the same levels of the student and the teacher, and cross-level connection
paths had not been considered. Chen et al. propose a new residual learning
framework to train a single student layer using multiple teacher layers. They
also design a novel fusion module to condense feature maps across levels and a
loss function to compare feature information stored across different levels to
improve performance. In this work, we consistently verify the improvements in
test accuracy across student models as reported in the original paper and study
the effectiveness of the novel modules introduced by conducting ablation
studies and new experiments.

recommender systems, simple methods such as matrix factorization with quadratic
loss are still used in industry for several reasons. These models can be
trained with alternating least squares, which makes them easy to implement in a
massively parallel manner, thus making it possible to utilize billions of
events from real-world datasets. Large-scale recommender systems need to
account for severe popularity skew in the distributions of users and items, so
a lot of research is focused on implementing sparse, mixed dimension or shared
embeddings to reduce both the number of parameters and overfitting on rare
users and items. In this paper we propose two matrix factorization models with
mixed dimension embeddings, which can be optimized in a massively parallel
fashion using the alternating least squares approach.

Unfortunately, the current collections of publicly available research articles
are either small or heterogeneous and unstructured. In this work, we perform
topic segmentation of a paper data collection that we crawled and produce a
multitopic dataset of roughly seven million paper data records. We construct a
taxonomy of topics extracted from the data records and then annotate each
document with its corresponding topic from that taxonomy. As a result, it is
possible to use this newly proposed dataset in two modalities: as a
heterogeneous collection of documents from various disciplines or as a set of
homogeneous collections, each from a single research topic.

black hole using inputs from the dual boundary field theory. Here, we have
varied the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the Newton's gravitational
constant $G$ along with the Born-Infeld parameter $b$ in the bulk. A novel
universal critical behaviour of the central charge (occurring in the boundary
conformal field theory) in extended black hole thermodynamics for charged black
holes has been recently observed \cite{mann1}, and we have extended this study
to Born-Infeld $AdS$ black holes. The Born-Infeld parameter has the dimension
of inverse length, therefore, when considered in the first law of
thermodynamics of the bulk in the mixed form which includes the central charge
of the boundary conformal field theory, it modifies the thermodynamic volume
and the chemical potential (which are conjugate to pressure and central charge
respectively). We observe that due to this inclusion of the Born-Infeld
non-linearity in this analysis, the universal nature of the critical value of
the central charge observed in \cite{mann1} breaks down. We also observe an
interesting behaviour of the free energy of the black hole with Hawking
temperature due to the variations in both the central charge and the
Born-Infeld parameter. It is also observed in our analysis that for a
sufficiently small value of the Born-Infeld parameter (small value of this
parameter has more prominent non-linear effects), there exists a critical value
of the temperature below which no black hole can exist.

their macroscopic PDE limit, in the non-mean-field regime; that is, we consider
the case in which each particle/agent in the system interacts only with a
prescribed subset of the particles in the system (for example, those within a
certain distance). In this non-mean-field regime the influence between agents
(i.e. the interaction term) can be normalised either by the total number of
agents in the system (\textit{global scaling}) or by the number of agents with
which the particle is effectively interacting (\textit{local scaling}). We
compare the behaviour of the globally scaled and the locally scaled systems in
many respects, considering for each scaling both the PDE and the corresponding
particle model. In particular we observe that both the locally and globally
scaled particle system exhibit pattern formation (i.e. formation of
travelling-wave-like solutions) within certain parameter regimes, and generally
display similar dynamics. The same is not true of the corresponding PDE models.
Indeed, while both PDE models have multiple stationary states, for the globally
scaled PDE such (space-homogeneous) equilibria are unstable for certain
parameter regimes, with the instability leading to travelling wave solutions,
while they are always stable for the locally scaled one, which never produces
travelling waves. This observation is based on a careful numerical study of the
model, supported by further analysis.

price lag vs. information. We conclude with open questions on general $n$-ary
option markets. As a by-product of the analysis, we show that these markets are
equivalent to a simple recurrent neural network, helping to explain some of the
predictive power associated with prediction markets, which are usually designed
as $n$-ary option markets.

interpolation methods especially when a chaotic signal is involved. The logic
behind the formulation of an iterated function system for the construction of
fractal interpolation functions is to divide the entire interpolating domain
into subdomains and define functions on each subdomain piecewisely. The
objective of this paper is to explore the significance of the end point
conditions on the graphical representation of the resultant functions and their
numerical integration. The central problem in the formulation of the IFS, the
continuity of the fractal interpolation functions, is addressed with an
explanation on the techniques implemented to resolve the problem. Instead of an
analytical expression, the fractal interpolation functions are always
represented in terms of recursive relations. This paper further presents the
derivation of these recursive relations and proposes a straightforward method
to find the approximating function, involved in these relations.

spreading information to a multitude of users through posts called 'tweets'.
Users can easily re-share these posts to other users through 'retweets', which
allow information to cascade to many more users, increasing its outreach.
Clearly, being able to know the extent to which a post can be retweeted has
great value in advertising, influencing and other such campaigns. In this paper
we propose ViralBERT, which can be used to predict the virality of tweets using
content- and user-based features. We employ a method of concatenating numerical
features such as hashtags and follower numbers to tweet text, and utilise two
BERT modules: one for semantic representation of the combined text and
numerical features, and another module purely for sentiment analysis of text,
as both the information within text and it's ability to elicit an emotional
response play a part in retweet proneness. We collect a dataset of 330k tweets
to train ViralBERT and validate the efficacy of our model using baselines from
current studies in this field. Our experiments show that our approach
outperforms these baselines, with a 13% increase in both F1 Score and Accuracy
compared to the best performing baseline method. We then undergo an ablation
study to investigate the importance of chosen features, finding that text
sentiment and follower counts, and to a lesser extent mentions and following
counts, are the strongest features for the model, and that hashtag counts are
detrimental to the model.
