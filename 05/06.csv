despite being an important element of polite and figurative language.
Euphemisms prove to be a difficult topic, not only because they are subject to
language change, but also because humans may not agree on what is a euphemism
and what is not. Nevertheless, the first step to tackling the issue is to
collect and analyze examples of euphemisms. We present a corpus of potentially
euphemistic terms (PETs) along with example texts from the GloWbE corpus.
Additionally, we present a subcorpus of texts where these PETs are not being
used euphemistically, which may be useful for future applications. We also
discuss the results of multiple analyses run on the corpus. Firstly, we find
that sentiment analysis on the euphemistic texts supports that PETs generally
decrease negative and offensive sentiment. Secondly, we observe cases of
disagreement in an annotation task, where humans are asked to label PETs as
euphemistic or not in a subset of our corpus text examples. We attribute the
disagreement to a variety of potential reasons, including if the PET was a
commonly accepted term (CAT).

around a Sun-like star member of the Hyades open cluster. So far, no other
substellar companions have been unambiguously confirmed via direct imaging
around main-sequence stars in Hyades. The star HIP 21152 is an accelerating
star as identified by the astrometry from the Gaia and Hipparcos satellites. We
have detected the companion, HIP 21152 B, in multi-epoch using the
high-contrast imaging from SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2. We have also obtained
the stellar radial-velocity data from the Okayama 188cm telescope. The CHARIS
spectroscopy reveals that HIP 21152 B's spectrum is consistent with the L/T
transition, best fit by an early T dwarf. Our orbit modeling determines the
semi-major axis and the dynamical mass of HIP 21152 B to be
17.5$^{+7.2}_{-3.8}$ au and 27.8$^{+8.4}_{-5.4}$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$, respectively.
The mass ratio of HIP 21152 B relative to its host is $\approx$2\%, near the
planet/brown dwarf boundary suggested from recent surveys. Mass estimates
inferred from luminosity evolution models are slightly higher (33--42
$M_{\rm{Jup}}$). With a dynamical mass and a well-constrained age due to the
system's Hyades membership, HIP 21152 B will become a critical benchmark in
understanding the formation, evolution, and atmosphere of a substellar object
as a function of mass and age. Our discovery is yet another key
proof-of-concept for using precision astrometry to select direct imaging
targets.

on the Player Vectors using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Another NMF
process was run on the player vectors to extract different types of playing
styles. The resulting player vectors discovered 18 different playing styles in
the CSL. Six performance indicators of each style were investigated to observe
their contributions. In general, the playing styles of forwards and midfielders
are in line with football performance evolution trends, while the styles of
defenders should be reconsidered. Multifunctional playing styles were also
found in high rated CSL players.

who can publicly signal about an uncertain infectious risk parameter.
Signalling leads to an updated public belief over the parameter, and agents
then make equilibrium choices on whether to work remotely or in-person. The
planner maintains a set of desirable outcomes for each realization of the
uncertain parameter and seeks to maximize the probability that agents choose an
acceptable outcome for the true parameter. We distinguish between stateless and
stateful objectives. In the former, the set of desirable outcomes does not
change as a function of the risk parameter, whereas in the latter it does. For
stateless objectives, we reduce the problem to maximizing the probability of
inducing mean beliefs that lie in intervals computable from the set of
desirable outcomes. We derive the optimal signalling mechanism and show that it
partitions the parameter domain into at most two intervals with the signals
generated according to an interval-specific distribution. For the stateful
case, we consider a practically relevant situation in which the planner can
enforce in-person work capacity limits that progressively get more stringent as
the risk parameter increases. We show that the optimal signalling mechanism for
this case can be obtained by solving a linear program. We numerically verify
the improvement in achieving desirable outcomes using our information design

dynamically solved Bethe-Salpeter wave functions. The vector meson TMDs are
then studied with the light front overlap representation at leading Fock-state.
All the obtained TMDs are non-vanishing and evolve with current quark mass, in
particular the tensor polarized TMDs $f_{1LT}$ and $f_{1TT}$ which undergo a
sign flip. The $\rho$ TMDs are compared with other model studies and agreement
is found, aside from $f_{1LT}$ and $f_{1TT}$. Finally, the collinear PDFs of
vector mesons are studied. The $\rho$'s valence PDFs $f_{1,v}(x)$ and
$g_{1L,v}(x)$ are evolved to the scale of 2.4 GeV, with their first three
moments compared to lattice QCD prediction. The qualitative behavior of tensor
polarized PDF $f_{1LL}(x)$ in $\rho$ at large $x$ is also discussed.

instrumental for the design of a state-feedback control which linearises and
makes the dynamics deterministic. We observe that this control is idealistic,
i.e. it is not practically implementable because it employs a feedback of the
Brownian motion (which is never available) to cancel the noise. Using the
idealistic control as a starting point, we introduce a hybrid control
architecture which achieves \emph{practical} path-wise control. This hybrid
controller uses measurements of the state to perform periodic compensations for
the noise contribution to the dynamics. We prove that the hybrid controller
retrieves the idealistic performances in the limit as the compensating period

it in the idealistic and in the practical framework. We finally validate the

the need for time-resolved measurements on grounds of similarity of flow
regions in different snapshots. The main hypothesis is that, with a
sufficiently large ensemble of statistically-independent snapshots, the
identification of flow structures that are morphologically similar but
occurring at different time instants is feasible. Measured individual vectors
from different snapshots with similar flow organisation can thus be merged,
resulting in an artificially increased particle concentration. This allows to
refine the interrogation region and, consequently, increase the spatial
resolution. The measurement domain is split in subdomains. The similarity is
enforced only on a local scale, i.e. morphologically-similar regions are sought
only among subdomains corresponding to the same flow region. The identification
of locally-similar snapshots is based on unsupervised K-nearest neighbours
search in a space of significant flow features. Such features are defined in
terms of a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, performed in subdomains on the
original low-resolution data, obtained either with standard cross-correlation
or with binning of Particle Tracking Velocimetry data with a relatively large
bin size. A refined bin size is then selected according to the number of
""sufficiently close"" snapshots identified. The statistical dispersion of the
velocity vectors within the bin is then used to estimate the uncertainty and to
select the optimal K which minimises it. The method is tested and validated
against datasets with a progressively increasing level of complexity: two
virtual experiments based on direct simulations of the wake of a fluidic
pinball and a channel flow and the experimental data collected in a turbulent

analytic outcome. However, the granularity and quality of the estimates

the appearance and evolution of life can take place on gigayear timescales,

over a multidimensional parameter space. Relative habitability quantifies the
integrated habitability probability compared to a system containing only a
single Earth-like planet. We find trends with mass, eccentricity, location,
spacing, inclination, and alignment of the giant planets, including
configurations where the system is more habitable due to the giant planets. As
long as the system remains stable, a moderate eccentricity excitation of the
terrestrial planet can be beneficial by increasing the outer boundary of the
habitable zone through higher mean irradiance. In our simulations, the median

pair within a crystal - is routinely used to interpret and model a wealth of
excited-state phenomena in semiconductors. Beside originating sub-band gap
signatures in optical spectra, optical excitons have also been predicted to
condensate, diffuse, recombine, relax. However, all these phenomena are rooted
on a theoretical definition of the excitonic state based on the following
simple picture: ""excitons"" are actual particles that both appear as peaks in
the linear absorption spectrum and also behave as well-defined quasiparticles.
In this paper we show, instead, that the electron-phonon interaction decomposes
the initial optical excitons into \textit{elemental} excitons, the latter being
a different kind of bound electron-hole pairs lacking the effect caused by the
induced, classical, electric field. This is demonstrated within a many-body
perturbation theory approach starting from the interacting electronic
Hamiltonian including both electron-phonon and electron-hole interactions. We
then apply the results on two realistic systems, monolayer MoS$_2$ (where the
lowest-bound exciton is optically inactive) and monolayer MoSe$_2$ (where it is
optically active), using first-principles methods to compute the exciton-phonon
coupling matrix elements. Among the consequences of optical-elemental
decomposition, we point to a homogeneous broadening of absorption peaks
occurring even for the lowest-bound optical exciton, we demonstrate this by
computing exciton-phonon transition rates. More generally, our findings suggest
that the optical excitons gradually lose their initial structure and evolve as
elemental excitons. These states can be regarded as the real intrinsic
excitations of the interacting system, the ones that survive when the external
perturbation and the induced electric fields have vanished.

be flattened by the tuning of a small number of parameters. We devise a
criterion that, given a symmetry group, allows for the calculation of the
number of parameters required to make the Dirac velocity vanish. This criterion
is employed to study band flattening in twisted bilayer graphene and in surface
states of 3D topological insulators. Following this discussion, we identify the
symmetries under which the vanishing of the Dirac velocity implies the
emergence of perfectly-flat bands. Our analysis allows us to construct
additional model Hamiltonians that display perfectly-flat bands at certain
points in the space of parameters: the first is a toy model of two coupled 3D
TI surfaces, and the second is a quasi-crystalline generalization of the chiral
model of TBG.

first-principles methods to predict these interaction variations and reveal

to the teaching dimension with respect to any other collusion-free teaching

we characterize the maximum concept classes of NC-teaching dimension $1$ as
classes which are induced by tournaments (= complete oriented graphs) in a very
natural way. Second, we show that there exists a family $(\cC_n)_{n\ge1}$ of
concept classes such that the well known recursive teaching dimension (= RTD)
of $\cC_n$ grows logarithmically in $n = |\cC_n|$ while, for every $n\ge1$, the
NC-teaching dimension of $\cC_n$ equals $1$. Since the recursive teaching
dimension of a finite concept class $\cC$ is generally bounded $\log|\cC|$, the
family $(\cC_n)_{n\ge1}$ separates RTD from NCTD in the most striking way. The
proof of existence of the family $(\cC_n)_{n\ge1}$ makes use of the
probabilistic method and random tournaments. Third, we improve the
afore-mentioned upper bound $2^d\binom{n}{d}$ by a factor of order $\sqrt{d}$.
The verification of the superior bound makes use of Johnson graphs and maximum

expect from telemedicine apps, independent of their past experience. Finally,
we explore how to address the issues we discovered and how telemedicine may be

external gravitational torques depends strongly on their internal structure. In
particular, the existence of the mode known as the Free Core Nutation in the
fluid core, is known to amplify the forced nutations in the near-diurnal
retrograde frequency band (as measured in the planetary frame of reference).
Due to their proximity in shape and frequency, this mode is sometimes equated
with the so-called Spin-Over Mode which denotes the free oscillation of a
steadily rotating ellipsoidal fluid core. Through a careful study of the freely
rotating two-layer planetary model with a rigid mantle and an inviscid fluid
core, we show that the Spin-Over Mode frequency corresponds to that where the
sum of the external and internal torques on the mantle are balanced, causing it
to rotate steadily. The presence of dissipation at the Core-Mantle Boundary
causes the Free Core Nutation to become damped and slightly offset its
resonance frequency. We show that this offset, which is $\approx-1$ day for the
Earth, can be interpreted as the result of the proximity of the Free Core
Nutation frequency to that of the Spin-Over Mode, which now corresponds to a
minimum in the magnitude of the transfer function for nutations. We also show
how this proximity leads to a slightly lower Quality factor for the resonance
than that compute from the usual formula. We conclude by discussing possible
implications of this mechanism for Mars, the Moon, and the long-term evolution
of the Earth.

ranks of individuals change over time. Therefore, in certain circumstances
mobility measures may not describe the feasibility of the typical individual to
change their wealth ranking. To address this issue, we introduce mixing, a
concept from statistical physics, as a relevant phenomenon for quantifying the
ability of individuals to move across the whole wealth distribution. We display
the relationship between mixing and mobility by studying the relaxation time, a
statistical measure for the degree of mixing, in reallocating geometric
Brownian motion (RGBM). RGBM is an established model of wealth in a growing and
reallocating economy that distinguishes between a mixing and a non-mixing
wealth dynamics regime. We show that measures of mixing are inherently
connected to the concept of economic mobility: while certain individuals can
move across the distribution when wealth is a non-mixing observable, only in
the mixing case every individual is able to move across the whole wealth
distribution. Then, there is also a direct equivalence between measures of
mixing and the magnitude of the standard measures of economic mobility. On the
other hand, the opposite is not true. Wealth dynamics, are however, best
modeled as non-mixing. Hence, measuring mobility using standard measures in a
non-mixing system may lead to misleading conclusions about the extent of
mobility across the whole distribution.

argue that the first effect can be seen as the saturation of the medium in

atomically sharp layers at both hetero-interfaces, which in turn promotes
proximity-induced superconductivity that originates in the gallium film. A
lithography-free, van der Waals tunnel junction is developed to perform
transport tunneling spectroscopy. We find a robust, proximity-induced
superconducting gap formed in the Dirac surface states in 5-10 quintuple-layer
(Bi,Sb)2Te3/graphene/gallium heterostructures. The presence of a single
Abrikosov vortex, where the Majorana zero modes are expected to reside,

of finding the input to a hidden function that extremizes the function output,
without having direct access to the hidden function, given only partial
input-output (training) data. The algorithm, called quantum extremal learning
(QEL), consists of a parametric quantum circuit that is variationally trained
to model data input-output relationships and where a trainable quantum feature
map, that encodes the input data, is analytically differentiated in order to
find the coordinate that extremizes the model. This enables the combination of
established quantum machine learning modelling with established quantum
optimization, on a single circuit/quantum computer. We have tested our
algorithm on a range of classical datasets based on either discrete or
continuous input variables, both of which are compatible with the algorithm. In
case of discrete variables, we test our algorithm on synthetic problems
formulated based on Max-Cut problem generators and also considering higher
order correlations in the input-output relationships. In case of the continuous
variables, we test our algorithm on synthetic datasets in 1D and simple
ordinary differential functions. We find that the algorithm is able to
successfully find the extremal value of such problems, even when the training
dataset is sparse or a small fraction of the input configuration space. We
additionally show how the algorithm can be used for much more general cases of
higher dimensionality, complex differential equations, and with full
flexibility in the choice of both modeling and optimization ansatz. We envision
that due to its general framework and simple construction, the QEL algorithm
will be able to solve a wide variety of applications in different fields,
opening up areas of further research.

the flux was higher. Using the gamma-ray spectrum and four models of the

on the redshift of the source was found to be z<=0.31. Unlike the gamma-ray and
X-ray bands, the optical flux did not increase significantly during the studied

optical to X-ray bands suggests that the synchrotron peak of the spectral
energy distribution (SED) may become broader during flaring states, which can
be adequately described with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model varying
the high-energy end of the underlying particle spectrum. The synchrotron peak
frequency of the SED, as well as the radio morphology of the jet from the

such as cell division and motility, which often involve dynamic changes of cell
shape. These changes in cell shape may in turn affect the dynamics of
pattern-forming proteins, hence leading to an intricate feedback loop between
cell shape and chemical dynamics. While several computational studies have
examined the resulting rich dynamics, the underlying mechanisms are not yet
fully understood. To elucidate some of these mechanisms, we explore a
conceptual model for cell polarity on a dynamic one-dimensional manifold. Using
concepts from differential geometry, we derive the equations governing
mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems on time-evolving manifolds.
Analyzing these equations mathematically, we show that dynamic shape changes of
the membrane can induce pattern-forming instabilities in parts of the membrane,
which we refer to as regional instabilities. Deformations of the local membrane
geometry can also (regionally) suppress pattern formation and spatially shift
already existing patterns. We explain our findings by applying and generalizing
the local equilibria theory of mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems. This
allows us to determine a simple onset criterion for geometry-induced
pattern-forming instabilities, which is linked to the phase-space structure of
the reaction-diffusion system. The feedback loop between membrane shape
deformations and reaction-diffusion dynamics then leads to a surprisingly rich
phenomenology of patterns, including oscillations, traveling waves, and
standing waves that do not occur in systems with a fixed membrane shape. Our
work reveals that the local conformation of the membrane geometry acts as an
important dynamical control parameter for pattern formation in mass-conserving

correlators from lattice QCD and find them to lie within $\sim10\%$ of each

Motivated by these studies, for frequencies $\omega\lesssim2.5\,$GeV we use fit
ans\""atze to the spectral functions that perform well when applied to mock data
generated from the NLO QCD or from the strongly-coupled SYM spectral functions,

of a 3D shape with an adaptive feature volume organized by an octree and
applies a compact multilayer perceptron network for mapping the features to the
field value at each 3D position. An encoder-decoder network is designed to
learn the adaptive feature volume based on the graph convolutions over the dual

operator defined over a regular grid of features fused from irregular
neighboring octree nodes at different levels, which not only reduces the
computational and memory cost of the convolutions over irregular neighboring
octree nodes, but also improves the performance of feature learning. Our method
effectively encodes shape details, enables fast 3D shape reconstruction, and
exhibits good generality for modeling 3D shapes out of training categories. We

gets stuck when the initial contact points of the end effectors are sub-optimal
or when performing multi-stage tasks that require contact point switching,
which often leads to local minima. To address this challenge, we propose a
contact point discovery approach (CPDeform) that guides the stand-alone
differentiable physics solver to deform various soft-body plasticines. The key
idea of our approach is to integrate optimal transport-based contact points
discovery into the differentiable physics solver to overcome the local minima

the effectiveness of our method, we introduce PlasticineLab-M that extends the
existing differentiable physics benchmark PlasticineLab to seven new
challenging multi-stage soft-body manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental
results suggest that: 1) on multi-stage tasks that are infeasible for the
vanilla differentiable physics solver, our approach discovers contact points
that efficiently guide the solver to completion; 2) on tasks where the vanilla

approach to identifying, ranking and profiling traffic accident high

studies on traffic accident hot spots have mostly adopted spatial statistics
and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) where spatial point patterns are
discovered based only on spatial dependence with no recognition of the temporal
dependence of the events. A limitation arises from the fact that the results
are either under or over-estimated because of the temporal aggregation of the
events to an absolute time point. Furthermore, the existing methods apart from
the Network Kernel Density Estimation (NETKDE), consider traffic accident
events as events randomly on a 2-D geographic space. However, traffic accident
events are network constrained events that happens majorly on the road network
space. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt the connectivity of graph on a
network space approach that identifies accident high risk-locations based on
space-time-varying connectivity between traffic accident events and the road
network geometry. A simple but extensible traffic accident space time-varying

accident high risk-locations are identified and ranked in space and time using
time-dependent degree centrality and PageRank centrality graph metrics

corrections which strongly constrains the D3 tadpole. The minimally required
tadpole ranges from $\mathcal{O}(500)$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ or more and
depends strongly on other data, in particular on the Euler number of the
Calabi-Yau 3-fold, the triple-self-intersection and Euler numbers of the small
divisor and the coefficient $a_s$ appearing in the non-perturbative
superpotential. We give arguments suggesting that satisfying these constraints
is very challenging and perhaps impossible.

is characterized by correlation functions $\langle \mathcal{E}(\vec n_1)\cdots

There has been significant recent progress in studying energy flux, including
the calculation of multi-point correlation functions and their direct
measurement inside high-energy jets at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this
paper, we build on these advances by defining a notion of ""celestial
non-gaussianity"" as a ratio of the three-point function to a product of
two-point functions. We show that this celestial non-gaussianity is under
perturbative control within jets at the LHC, allowing us to cleanly access the
non-gaussian interactions of quarks and gluons. We find good agreement between
perturbative calculations of the non-gaussianity and a charged-particle-based
analysis using CMS Open Data, and we observe a strong non-gaussianity peaked in
the ""flattened triangle"" regime. The ability to robustly study three-point
correlations is a significant step in advancing our understanding of jet
substructure at the LHC. We anticipate that the celestial non-gaussianity, and
its generalizations, will play an important role in the development of
higher-order parton showers simulations and in the hunt for ever more subtle
signals of potential new physics within jets.

disc models, calibrated with results of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Our focus
lies on non-self-gravitating discs, but we also discuss to what degree our
prescription could be applied when the discs are self-gravitating.
  We study migration using torque densities. Our model for the torque density
is based on existing fitting formulas, which we subsequently modify to prevent
premature gap-opening. At higher planetary masses, we also apply torque
densities from hydrodynamic simulations directly to our 1D model. These torque
densities allow modelling the orbital evolution of an initially low-mass planet
that undergoes runaway-accretion to become a massive planet. The two-way
exchange of angular momentum between disc and planet is included. This leads to
a self-consistent treatment of gap formation that only relies on directly
accessible disc parameters. We present a formula for Bondi- and Hill- gas
accretion in the disc-limited regime. This formula is self-consistent in the
sense that mass is removed from the disc in the location from where it is
accreted.
  We find that the resulting evolution in mass and semi-major axis in the 1D
framework is in good agreement with those from 3D hydrodynamical simulations
for a range of parameters.
  Our prescription is valuable for simultaneously modelling migration and
accretion in 1D-models. We conclude that it is appropriate and beneficial to
apply torque densities from hydrodynamic simulations in 1D models, at least in
the parameter space we study here. More work is needed to in order to determine
whether our approach is also applicable in an even wider parameter space and in
situations with more complex disc thermodynamics, or when the disc is
self-gravitating.

chain. The ABF diamond chain possesses three dispersionless flat bands with all
the eigenstates compactly localized on two unit cells in the zero disorder
limit. The fate of the compact localized states in the presence of the disorder
depends on the symmetry of the applied potential. We consider two cases here: a
symmetric one, where the same disorder is applied to the top and bottom sites
of a unit cell and an antisymmetric one, where the disorder applied to the top
and bottom sites are of equal magnitude but with opposite signs. Remarkably,
the symmetrically perturbed lattice preserves compact localization, although
the degeneracy is lifted. When the lattice is perturbed antisymmetrically, not
only is the degeneracy is lifted but compact localization is also destroyed.
Fascinatingly, all eigenstates exhibit a multifractal nature below a critical
strength of the applied potential. A central band of eigenstates continue to
display an extended yet non-ergodic behaviour for arbitrarily large strengths
of the potential. All other eigenstates exhibit the familiar Anderson
localization above the critical potential strength. We show how the
antisymmetric disordered model can be mapped to a $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rotated
square lattice with nearest and selective next-nearest neighbour hopping and a
staggered magnetic field - such models have been shown to exhibit
multifractality. Surprisingly, the antisymmetric disorder (with an even number
of unit cells) preserves chiral symmetry - we show this by explicitly writing
down the chiral operator.

Using Gaia proper motions, we show that the orbital pole alignment is much more

two such systems. The first, SDSS J084617.11+245344.1, was observed by the
Kepler spacecraft for 80 days during Campaign 16 of the K2 mission, and we
identify it as a new asynchronous polar with a likely 4.64 h orbital period.
This is significantly longer than any other asynchronous polar, as well as all

other to produce a conspicuous 6.77 d beat period, across which the system's
accretion geometry gradually changes. The second system in this study, Paloma,

Until now, there had been an ambiguity in its spin period, but the TESS power
spectrum pinpoints a spin period of 2.27 h. During the resulting 0.7 d

the airless nightside -- this partial atmosphere is critical to the
interpretation of lava planet observations, but transports negligible heat
towards the nightside. As a result, the surface temperature of the magma ocean
may range from 3000~K near the sub-stellar point down to 1500~K near the

geochemistry of partial melt to predict the physical and chemical properties of
the magma ocean as a function of the distance from the sub-stellar point. Our
two principal findings are that 1) the dayside magma ocean is much deeper than
previously thought, probably extending down to the core-mantle boundary in some

providing the backbone of a new generation of neural systems that outperform
traditional methods on a variety of tasks. However, it is still unclear to what
extent such approaches generalize in zero-shot conditions. The recent BEIR
benchmark provides partial answers to this question by comparing models on
datasets and tasks that differ from the training conditions. We aim to address
the same question by comparing models under more explicit distribution shifts.
To this end, we build three query-based distribution shifts within MS MARCO
(query-semantic, query-intent, query-length), which are used to evaluate the
three main families of neural retrievers based on BERT: sparse, dense, and
late-interaction -- as well as a monoBERT re-ranker. We further analyse the
performance drops between the train and test query distributions. In
particular, we experiment with two generalization indicators: the first one
based on train/test query vocabulary overlap, and the second based on
representations of a trained bi-encoder. Intuitively, those indicators verify
that the further away the test set is from the train one, the worse the drop in
performance. We also show that models respond differently to the shifts --
dense approaches being the most impacted. Overall, our study demonstrates that
it is possible to design more controllable distribution shifts as a tool to
better understand generalization of IR models. Finally, we release the MS MARCO
query subsets, which provide an additional resource to benchmark zero-shot
transfer in Information Retrieval.

  A&A","A&A 666, A200 (2022)","10.1051/0004-6361/202243950",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  (Abridged) The Euclid mission is expected to discover thousands of z>6
galaxies in three Deep Fields, which together will cover a ~40 deg2 area.
However, the limited number of Euclid bands and availability of ancillary data
could make the identification of z>6 galaxies challenging. In this work, we
assess the degree of contamination by intermediate-redshift galaxies (z=1-5.8)
expected for z>6 galaxies within the Euclid Deep Survey. This study is based on
~176,000 real galaxies at z=1-8 in a ~0.7 deg2 area selected from the
UltraVISTA ultra-deep survey, and ~96,000 mock galaxies with 25.3$\leq$H<27.0,
which altogether cover the range of magnitudes to be probed in the Euclid Deep
Survey. We simulate Euclid and ancillary photometry from the fiducial, 28-band
photometry, and fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to various
combinations of these simulated data. Our study demonstrates that identifying
z>6 with Euclid data alone will be very effective, with a z>6 recovery of
91(88)% for bright (faint) galaxies. For the UltraVISTA-like bright sample, the
percentage of z=1-5.8 contaminants amongst apparent z>6 galaxies as observed
with Euclid alone is 18%, which is reduced to 4(13)% by including ultra-deep
Rubin (Spitzer) photometry. Conversely, for the faint mock sample, the
contamination fraction with Euclid alone is considerably higher at 39%, and
minimized to 7% when including ultra-deep Rubin data. For UltraVISTA-like
bright galaxies, we find that Euclid (I-Y)>2.8 and (Y-J)<1.4 colour criteria
can separate contaminants from true z>6 galaxies, although these are applicable
to only 54% of the contaminants, as many have unconstrained (I-Y) colours. In
the most optimistic scenario, these cuts reduce the contamination fraction to
1% whilst preserving 81% of the fiducial z>6 sample. For the faint mock sample,
colour cuts are infeasible.

electrons or muons in association with jets, in proton-proton collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data were recorded by the CMS
Collaboration at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The
differential cross sections are measured as a function of the transverse
momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) of the Z boson and the transverse momentum and
rapidities of the five jets with largest $p_\mathrm{T}$. The jet multiplicity
distribution is measured for up to eight jets. The hadronic activity in the
events is estimated using the scalar sum of the $p_\mathrm{T}$ of all the jets.
All measurements are unfolded to the stable particle-level and compared with
predictions from various Monte Carlo event generators, as well as with
expectations at leading and next-to-leading orders in perturbative quantum
chromodynamics.

unintegrated parton densities (UPDFs) have been discussed by several groups. In
the first part of this manuscript, we remind the issues encountered with these
definitions and discuss the proposed solutions. In our opinion, none of these
solutions is fully satisfactory. We observe that these issues seem to be
related to the normalization condition where the UPDFs are related to the
collinear PDFs by an integration over transverse momentum cut off by the
factorization scale. Then, we build a modified version of the angular-ordering
KMRW UPDFs, obeying the normalization condition with the transverse momentum
integrated up to infinity and show that the usual issues are absent.

seasonal contrast, which has a number of cascading consequences for life. How
moderately high obliquity (obliquities greater than Earth's current obliquity

various planetary obliquities, bioessential nutrient inventories, and
biospheric structure. We find that the net rate of photosynthesis increased by
35$\%$ and sea-to-air flux of biogenic oxygen doubled between the 0$^{\circ}$
and 45$^{\circ}$ obliquity scenarios, which is an equivalent response to
doubling bioessential nutrients. Our results suggest that moderately
high-obliquity planets have higher potential for biospheric oxygenation than
their low-obliquity counterparts and that life on moderately high-obliquity
habitable planets may be easier to detect with next generation telescopes.
These moderately high-obliquity habitable planets may also be more conducive to
the evolution of complex life.

taken together with the alterations they induce in surrounding condensed
matter. Strong-coupling polarons form when electronic charge carriers become
self-trapped: bound within potential wells stabilized by carriers presence.
Distinctively, exciting these bound carriers generates broad absorption bands.
Strong-coupling polarons are slow and massive since moving them requires atomic
motion. Their transport differs qualitatively from that of conventional
electronic charge carriers. Large (strong-coupling) polarons move coherently
with mobilities that fall with rising temperature. These massive quasiparticles
very weak scatterings by phonons produce much lower room-temperature mobilities
than those permitted of conventional electronic charge carriers. Moreover, the
long scattering times associated with large polarons weak scattering relegates
their principal ac (Drude) transport to below phonon frequencies. Small
(strong-coupling) polarons move incoherently with even lower thermally assisted
mobilities. Strikingly, a magnetic field often deflects small polarons in the
opposite sense than it does conventional charge carriers, thereby producing
anomalously signed Hall Effects. In exceptional circumstances charge carriers
self-trap in pairs thereby forming large and small bipolarons. Some transport
features distinguish them from polarons. Interference between carrier-induced
atomic displacement patterns produce attractive interactions between
like-charged polarons and short-range repulsive interactions between oppositely
charged polarons.

problem. Within computer vision, a common approach to a lack of data is data
augmentation. Data augmentation is the process of creating additional training
examples by modifying existing ones. However, because the types of tasks and
data differ, the methods used in computer vision cannot be easily adapted to

manipulation. We argue that augmentations should be valid, relevant, and
diverse. We use these principles to formalize augmentation as an optimization
problem, with the objective function derived from physics and knowledge of the
manipulation domain. This method applies rigid body transformations to
trajectories of geometric state and action data. We test our method in two
scenarios: 1) learning the dynamics of planar pushing of rigid cylinders, and
2) learning a constraint checker for rope manipulation. These two scenarios
have different data and label types, yet in both scenarios, training on our
augmented data significantly improves performance on downstream tasks. We also

the noise robustness of quantum nonlocality with respect to unital and

noise is present we find numerical evidence suggesting that maximally entangled
state preparations yield maximal nonlocality. When nonunital noise is present
we find that nonmaximally entangled states can yield maximal nonlocality. Thus,
we show that variational quantum optimization is a practical design tool for

$j$ are defined as trajectories in which the subnetwork that consists of the
nodes and edges along the trajectory is a tree network. Moreover, the shortest
path between $i$ and $j$ on this subnetwork is the same as in the whole
network. The SPATH scenario is probable mainly when the length $\ell_{ij}$ of
the shortest path between the initial node $i$ and the target node $j$ is
small. The analytical results are found to be in very good agreement with the
results obtained from computer simulations.

adopted and deployed by analysts without formal training in NLP or machine

details and appropriate use is tailored primarily to individuals with ML or NLP
expertise. To address this gap, we conduct a design inquiry into interactive
model cards, which augment traditionally static model cards with affordances
for exploring model documentation and interacting with the models themselves.
Our investigation consists of an initial conceptual study with experts in ML,
NLP, and AI Ethics, followed by a separate evaluative study with non-expert
analysts who use ML models in their work. Using a semi-structured interview
format coupled with a think-aloud protocol, we collected feedback from a total
of 30 participants who engaged with different versions of standard and
interactive model cards. Through a thematic analysis of the collected data, we
identified several conceptual dimensions that summarize the strengths and
limitations of standard and interactive model cards, including: stakeholders;
design; guidance; understandability & interpretability; sensemaking &
skepticism; and trust & safety. Our findings demonstrate the importance of
carefully considered design and interactivity for orienting and supporting
non-expert analysts using deep learning models, along with a need for
consideration of broader sociotechnical contexts and organizational dynamics.
We have also identified design elements, such as language, visual cues, and
warnings, among others, that support interactivity and make non-interactive
content accessible. We summarize our findings as design guidelines and discuss
their implications for a human-centered approach towards AI/ML documentation.

operational costs and will soon have a considerable impact on the environment.
A possible countermeasure is equipping IT infrastructure directly with on-site
renewable energy sources. Yet, particularly smaller data centers may not be
able to use all generated power directly at all times, while feeding it into
the public grid or energy storage is often not an option. To maximize the usage
of renewable excess energy, we propose Cucumber, an admission control policy
that accepts delay-tolerant workloads only if they can be computed within their
deadlines without the use of grid energy. Using probabilistic forecasting of
computational load, energy consumption, and energy production, Cucumber can be
configured towards more optimistic or conservative admission. We evaluate our
approach on two scenarios using real solar production forecasts for Berlin,
Mexico City, and Cape Town in a simulation environment. For scenarios where
excess energy was actually available, our results show that Cucumber's default
configuration achieves acceptance rates close to the optimal case and causes
97.0% of accepted workloads to be powered using excess energy, while more
conservative admission results in 18.5% reduced acceptance at almost zero grid
power usage.

(SN) 2009ip taken almost a decade after explosion. The optical source has
continued to fade steadily since the SN-like event in 2012. In the F606W
filter, which was also used to detect its luminous blue variable (LBV)
progenitor 13~yr before the SN, the source at the position of SN2009ip is now
1.2mag fainter than that quiescent progenitor. It is 6-7mag fainter than the
pre-SN outbursts in 2009--2011. This definitively rules out a prediction that
the source would return to its previous state after surviving the 2012 event.
Instead, the late-time fading matches expectations for a terminal explosion.
The source fades at a similar rate in all visual-wavelength filters without
significant color changes, therefore also ruling out the hypothesis of a
luminous dust-obscured survivor or transition to a hotter post-LBV survivor.
The late-time continuum with steady color and strong H$\alpha$ emission
detected in a narrow F657N filter are, however, entirely expected for ongoing
shock interaction with circumstellar material in a decade-old core-collapse SN.
Interestingly, the ultraviolet flux has stayed nearly constant since 2015,
supporting previous conjectures that the F275W light traces main-sequence OB
stars in an underlying young star cluster. We expect that the visual-wavelength
continuum will eventually level off, tracing this cluster light. Without any
additional outbursts, it seems prudent to consider the 2012 event as a terminal
SN explosion, and we discuss plausible scenarios.

utilize symplectic and presymplectic geometry to investigate the properties of
adjoint systems associated with ordinary differential equations and
differential-algebraic equations, respectively. We show that the adjoint
variational quadratic conservation laws, which are key to adjoint sensitivity
analysis, arise from (pre)symplecticity of such adjoint systems. We discuss
various additional geometric properties of adjoint systems, such as symmetries
and variational characterizations. For adjoint systems associated with a

Gotay et al. [18]. As an application of this geometric framework, we discuss
how the adjoint variational quadratic conservation laws can be used to compute
sensitivities of terminal or running cost functions. Furthermore, we develop
structure-preserving numerical methods for such systems using Galerkin
Hamiltonian variational integrators (Leok and Zhang [23]) which admit discrete
analogues of these quadratic conservation laws. We additionally show that such

utilize this naturality to derive a variational error analysis result for the

this realization, we describe the mechanism underlying the training schemes

solves for the state variables on the characteristics, and the second branch
solves for the low-dimensional characteristics curves. The proposed

already distinct in its symmetric phase, before the electroweak breaking. This
picture is consistent as we understand that such couplings evolve independently
with the energy scale, meeting a common point together with the strong

implies that each independent coupling should be associated to independent
cocycles defined on a cohomological basis. The problem is that, before the GUT
symmetry breaking, the BRST operator associated to this symmetric phase
predicts a single Yang-Mills coupling. This sets the question of what should be

for robots to perform complex industrial and household interaction tasks (e.g.,

high degree of freedom of elasto-plastic objects, significant challenges exist
in virtually every aspect of the robotic manipulation pipeline, e.g.,
representing the states, modeling the dynamics, and synthesizing the control
signals. We propose to tackle these challenges by employing a particle-based
representation for elasto-plastic objects in a model-based planning framework.
Our system, RoboCraft, only assumes access to raw RGBD visual observations. It
transforms the sensing data into particles and learns a particle-based dynamics
model using graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the structure of the
underlying system. The learned model can then be coupled with model-predictive
control (MPC) algorithms to plan the robot's behavior. We show through
experiments that with just 10 minutes of real-world robotic interaction data,
our robot can learn a dynamics model that can be used to synthesize control
signals to deform elasto-plastic objects into various target shapes, including
shapes that the robot has never encountered before. We perform systematic
evaluations in both simulation and the real world to demonstrate the robot's
manipulation capabilities and ability to generalize to a more complex action
space, different tool shapes, and a mixture of motion modes. We also conduct
comparisons between RoboCraft and untrained human subjects controlling the
gripper to manipulate deformable objects in both simulation and the real world.
Our learned model-based planning framework is comparable to and sometimes
better than human subjects on the tested tasks.

in the space of probability density functions. A main result shows that along
the gradient flow induced by a distribution-dependent ordinary differential
equation (ODE), the unknown data distribution emerges as the long-time limit.
That is, one can uncover the data distribution by simulating the
distribution-dependent ODE. Intriguingly, the simulation of the ODE is shown
equivalent to the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs). This
equivalence provides a new ""cooperative"" view of GANs and, more importantly,
sheds new light on the divergence of GANs. In particular, it reveals that the
GAN algorithm implicitly minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between two
sets of samples, and this MSE fitting alone can cause GANs to diverge. To
construct a solution to the distribution-dependent ODE, we first show that the
associated nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation has a unique weak solution, by the
Crandall-Liggett theorem for differential equations in Banach spaces. Based on
this solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, we construct a unique solution to
the ODE, using Trevisan's superposition principle. The convergence of the

simulate traffic scenarios that rely on interactions with other vehicles.
Although many languages for high-level scenario modelling have been proposed,
they lack the features to precisely and reliably control the required
micro-simulation, while also supporting behavior reuse and test reproducibility
for a wide range of interactive scenarios. To fill this gap between scenario
design and execution, we propose the Simulated Driver-Vehicle Model (SDV) to
represent and simulate vehicles as dynamic entities with their behavior being
constrained by scenario design and goals set by testers. The model combines
driver and vehicle as a single entity. It is based on human-like driving and
the mechanical limitations of real vehicles for realistic simulation. The
layered architecture of the model leverages behavior trees to express
high-level behaviors in terms of lower-level maneuvers, affording multiple
driving styles and reuse. Further, optimization-based maneuver planner guides
the simulated vehicles towards the desired behavior. Our extensive evaluation
shows the model's design effectiveness using NHTSA pre-crash scenarios, its
motion realism in comparison to naturalistic urban traffic, and its scalability
with traffic density. Finally, we show the applicability of SDV model to test a
real ADS and to identify crash scenarios, which are impractical to represent
using predefined vehicle trajectories. The SDV model instances can be injected
into existing simulation environments via co-simulation.

thermal plasma in a stellarator. The magnetic field of a quasisymmetric
stellarator at high plasma pressure is significantly affected by the bootstrap
current, but the computational cost of accurate stellarator bootstrap
calculations has precluded use inside optimization. Here, a new efficient
method is demonstrated for optimization of quasisymmetric stellarator
configurations such that the bootstrap current profile is consistent with the
geometry. The approach is based on the fact that all neoclassical phenomena in
quasisymmetry are isomorphic to those in axisymmetry. Therefore accurate
formulae for the bootstrap current in tokamaks, which can be evaluated rapidly,
can be applied also in stellarators. The deviation between this predicted
parallel current and the actual parallel current in the magnetohydrodynamic
equilibrium is penalized in the objective function, and the current profile of
the equilibrium is included in the parameter space. Quasisymmetric
configurations with significant pressure are thereby obtained with
self-consistent bootstrap current and excellent confinement. In a comparison of
fusion-produced alpha particle confinement across many stellarators, the new
configurations have significantly lower alpha energy losses than many previous

chemically-active colloids can harness the energy from their environment

that leads to the self-propulsion of chemically active colloids. The coupling
between chemical reactions and momentum transport is a consequence of the
Onsager reciprocal relations. They state that the velocity and the surface
reaction rate are related to the mechanical and chemical affinities through a
symmetric matrix. A consequence of the Onsager reciprocal relations is that, if
a chemical reaction drives the motion of the colloid, then an external force
generates a reaction rate. Here, we investigate the Onsager reciprocal
relations for a spherical active colloid that catalyzes a reversible surface
chemical reaction between two species. We solve the relevant transport
equations using a perturbation expansion and numerical simulations to
demonstrate the validity of the reciprocal relations around the equilibrium.
Our results are consistent with previous studies and highlight the key role of
solute advection in preserving the symmetry of the Onsager matrix. Finally, we
show that the Onsager reciprocal relations break down around a nonequilibrium

(LVI) and fatigue progressive damage behaviours of a full-scale composite
helicopter tail structure under multipoint coordinated loading spectrum. First,
a fatigue progressive damage model (PDM) incorporating multiaxial fatigue
residual strength degradation rule, fatigue failure criteria based on fatigue
residual strength concept and sudden stiffness degradation rule was proposed.
Then, an LVI progressive damage model for plain-weave (PW) and unidirectional
(UD) composites was developed. Moreover, a full-process analysis algorithm with
a reasonable damage transfer strategy for pre-fatigue, LVI and fatigue
progressive damage analysis was proposed. Finally, a highly computational
efficient and accurate full-scale global-local finite element (FE) model of
helicopter tail structure was built to predict strain distribution under two
flight working conditions, to predict LVI damage under impact loading, and to
assess fatigue damage behaviours under multipoint coordinated loading spectrum.
The numerical predictions agree well with test results from this work and
literature data, indicating that the developed pre-fatigue, LVI, fatigue PDMs
and algorithms, as well as the global-local FE modelling based on
shell-to-solid coupling, can effectively analyse the impact damage tolerance of
full-scale aircraft structures.

which industries are related or how this empirical regularity can help inform
local industrial policy. We perform a structured search over tens of thousands
of specifications to identify robust -- in terms of out-of-sample predictions

To do so, we use data that allow us to derive relatedness from observing which
industries co-occur in the portfolios of establishments, firms, cities and
countries. Different portfolios yield different relatedness matrices, each of
which help predict the size and growth of local industries. However, our
specification search not only identifies ways to improve the performance of
such predictions, but also reveals new facts about the principle of relatedness
and important trade-offs between predictive performance and interpretability of
relatedness patterns. We use these insights to deepen our theoretical
understanding of what underlies path-dependent development in cities and expand

using spatial autocorrelation analysis, including other accuracy metrics
employed. In the general accuracy assessment, the DEM yielded root mean square

the bare lands were the most accurately represented on the DEM while heights
over built-up areas are the least accurate at both locations. Despite this, the
SPOT DEM accuracies in the varying land cover types surpassed its stated global

applications, where sensitive datasets from distributed clients are needed for
collaboratively training a global model. FL allows the clients to participate
in the training phase, governed by a central server, without sharing their
local data. One of the main challenges of FL is the communication overhead,
where the model updates of the participating clients are sent to the central
server at each global training round. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has
been recently proposed to alleviate the communication bottleneck where the
model updates are sent simultaneously over the multiple-access channel.
However, simple averaging of the model updates via AirComp makes the learning
process vulnerable to random or intended modifications of the local model
updates of some Byzantine clients. In this paper, we propose a transmission and
aggregation framework to reduce the effect of such attacks while preserving the
benefits of AirComp for FL. For the proposed robust approach, the central
server divides the participating clients randomly into groups and allocates a
transmission time slot for each group. The updates of the different groups are
then aggregated using a robust aggregation technique. We extend our approach to
handle the case of non-i.i.d. local data, where a resampling step is added
before robust aggregation. We analyze the convergence of the proposed approach
for both cases of i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data and demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm converges at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution.
Experiments on real datasets are provided to confirm the robustness of the
proposed approach.

which are invariant to an appropriate group action, and which separate orbits.
The motivation for this study comes from the usefulness of separating
invariants in proving universality of equivariant neural network architectures.
  We observe that in several cases the cardinality of separating invariants
proposed in the machine learning literature is much larger than the dimension
$D$. As a result, the theoretical universal constructions based on these
separating invariants is unrealistically large. Our goal in this paper is to
resolve this issue.
  We show that when a continuous family of semi-algebraic separating invariants
is available, separation can be obtained by randomly selecting 2D+1 of these
invariants. We apply this methodology to obtain an efficient scheme for
computing separating invariants for several classical group actions which have
been studied in the invariant learning literature. Examples include matrix
multiplication actions on point clouds by permutations, rotations, and various
other linear groups.
  Often the requirement of invariant separation is relaxed and only generic
separation is required. In this case, we show that only D+1 invariants are
required. More importantly, generic invariants are often significantly easier
to compute, as we illustrate by discussing generic and full separation for
weighted graphs. Finally we outline an approach for proving that separating
invariants can be constructed also when the random parameters have finite
precision.

which is to complete an image by generating semantically practical content.
Different from most existing image outpainting works, we approach the above
task by understanding and completing image semantics at the scene graph level.
In particular, we propose a novel network of Scene Graph Transformer (SGT),
which is designed to take node and edge features as inputs for modeling the
associated structural information. To better understand and process graph-based
inputs, our SGT uniquely performs feature attention at both node and edge
levels. While the former views edges as relationship regularization, the latter
observes the co-occurrence of nodes for guiding the attention process. We
demonstrate that, given a partial input image with its layout and scene graph,
our SGT can be applied for scene graph expansion and its conversion to a
complete layout. Following state-of-the-art layout-to-image conversions works,
the task of image outpainting can be completed with sufficient and practical
semantics introduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on the datasets of
MS-COCO and Visual Genome, which quantitatively and qualitatively confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed SGT and outpainting frameworks.

It behaves as classical waves in our Galaxy due to its large number density.
There have been various methods proposed to search for the wave-like DM, such
as methods utilizing interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.
Understanding the characteristics of DM signals is crucial to extract the
properties of DM from data. While the DM signal is nearly monochromatic with
the angular frequency of its mass, the amplitude and phase are gradually
changing due to the velocity dispersion of DMs in our Galaxy halo. The
stochastic amplitude and phase should be properly taken into account to
accurately constrain the coupling constant of DM from data. Previous works
formulated a method to obtain the upper bound on the coupling constant
incorporating the stochastic effects. One of these works compared the upper
bound with and without the stochastic effect in a measurement time that is much
shorter than the variation time scale of the amplitude and phase. In this
paper, we extend their formulation to arbitrary measurement time and evaluate
the stochastic effects. Moreover, we investigate the velocity-dependent signal
for dark photon DM including an uncertainly of the velocity. We demonstrate
that our method accurately estimates the upper bound on the coupling constant
with numerical simulations. We also estimate the expected upper bound of the
coupling constant of axion DM and dark photon DM from future experiments in a
semi-analytic way. The stochasticity especially affects constraints on a small
mass region. Our formulation offers a generic treatment of the ultralight

almost convex components, whose convex hulls can then be used to represent the
input shape. It thus enables efficient geometry processing algorithms
specifically designed for convex shapes and has been widely used in game
engines, physics simulations, and animation. While prior works can capture the
global structure of input shapes, they may fail to preserve fine-grained
details (e.g., filling a toaster's slots), which are critical for retaining the
functionality of objects in interactive environments. In this paper, we propose
a novel method that addresses the limitations of existing approaches from three
perspectives: (a) We introduce a novel collision-aware concavity metric that
examines the distance between a shape and its convex hull from both the
boundary and the interior. The proposed concavity preserves collision
conditions and is more robust to detect various approximation errors. (b) We
decompose shapes by directly cutting meshes with 3D planes. It ensures
generated convex hulls are intersection-free and avoids voxelization errors.
(c) Instead of using a one-step greedy strategy, we propose employing a
multi-step tree search to determine the cutting planes, which leads to a
globally better solution and avoids unnecessary cuttings. Through extensive
evaluation on a large-scale articulated object dataset, we show that our method
generates decompositions closer to the original shape with fewer components. It
thus supports delicate and efficient object interaction in downstream
applications. We will release our implementation to facilitate future research.

sensed data from external adversaries while assuming that the sensing device
itself is secure. Meanwhile, both the scale and frequency of IoT-focused

achieve this, sensed data must be protected from its genesis, i.e., from the

and becomes accessible to software. We refer to this property as PfB:
Privacy-from-Birth.
  In this work, we formalize PfB and design Verified Remote Sensing

guaranteeing that only correct execution of expected and explicitly authorized
software can access and manipulate sensing interfaces, specifically, General
Purpose Input/Output (GPIO), which is the usual boundary between analog and

that malware can neither gain access to sensed data on the GPIO-mapped memory

suspension. Separate shadowgraphy and OH* chemiluminescence measurements are
performed at 4000 Hz to study the droplet and flame dynamics, respectively. The
results show that both the droplet diameter squared and the flame
chemiluminescence feature intermittent oscillations. The droplet diameter
squared oscillations RMS is positively related to the number and intensity of
the atomization events and the graphene oxide doping concentration. The
probability density function of the inverse of the time separation between two
consecutive atomization events and the power spectrum density of the droplet
diameter squared oscillations feature dominant large probabilities and powers
at about 25 Hz prior to the occurrence of the first intense atomization event.
After the occurrence of the first intense atomization event, this frequency
decreases to about 5 Hz for both. Although the intense atomization triggers the
large amplitude oscillations at 5 Hz, it was argued that the retracting motion
of the igniter induces the oscillations at 25 Hz. Our findings suggest that the

Here, we investigate the Casimir interaction between two ultrathin films from
the perspective of the force distribution over real frequencies for the first

confined and nearly dispersion-free epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) modes that only
exist in ultrathin films. These contributions are found to persistently occur
around the ENZ frequency of the film and are irrespective of the inter-film

dependence in the averaged force density for conductive thin films, a metric
signifying a thin-film's acceleration due to Casimir effect. Our results shed
light on the role of the unique vacuum fluctuation modes existing in ultrathin
ENZ materials, which may offer significant potential for engineering the motion

specific, we create a mixture likelihood ratio (MLR) based policy gradient
optimization that can leverage the information from historical state-action
transitions generated under different behavioral policies. The proposed
variance reduction experience replay (VRER) approach can intelligently select
and reuse most relevant transition observations, improve the policy gradient
estimation, and accelerate the learning of optimal policy. Our empirical study
demonstrates that it can improve optimization convergence and enhance the
performance of state-of-the-art policy optimization approaches such as
actor-critic method and proximal policy optimizations.

getting popular recently as one representative gait parameter for health care

few labeled data problem. To solve above problems, this paper proposes a single
convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict stride length of running
and walking and classify the running or walking type per stride. The model
trains its pretext task with self-supervised learning on a large unlabeled
dataset for feature learning, and its downstream task on the stride length
estimation and classification tasks with supervised learning with a small
labeled dataset. The proposed model can achieve better average percent error,
4.78\%, on running and walking stride length regression and 99.83\% accuracy on
running and walking classification, when compared to the previous approach,
7.44\% on the stride length estimation.

learn effective representations that can be shared across tasks (Standley et

characteristics. Nevertheless, there are some samples that challenge such a

characteristics. Furthermore, GRBs are generally considered to be an event with
no periodic or repetitive behavior, since the progenitors usually undergo

In this work, we investigated Fermi data for possible quasiperiodic

report a special event GRB 201104A, which is a long-duration burst with the

that such a situation may arise from lensed SGRBs and attempt to verify it by
Bayesian inference. In addition, we extend the spectral analysis to Bayesian
inference. In spite of the existence of at least two distinct time periods with
a nearly identical spectrum, there is no strong evidence that they result from
a lensing GRB. Taking the gravitational-lensing scenario out of consideration,
a long burst would resemble a short burst in its repetitive behavior, which
presents a challenge for the current classification scheme.

Various theoretical proposals
have been presented, initially based on Penrose's Weyl Curvature Hypothesis,

(CET) considered a novel approach by defining such entropy from a Gibbs
equation constructed from an effective stress-energy tensor that emerges from
the 'square root' algebraic decomposition of the Bel-Robinson tensor, the
simplest divergence-less tensor related to the Weyl tensor. Since, so far all
gravitational entropy proposals have been applied to highly restrictive and
symmetric spacetimes, we probe in this paper the CET proposal for a class of
much less idealized spactimes (the Szekeres class I models) capable of
describing the joint evolution of arrays of arbitrary number of structures:
overdensities and voids, all placed on selected spatial locations in an
asymptotic $\Lambda$CDM backgound. By using suitable covariant variables and
their fluctuations, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a
positive CET entropy production to be a negative sign of the product of the
density and Hubble expansion fluctuations. To examine the viability of this
theoretical result we examine numerically the CET entropy production for two
elongated over dense regions surrounding a central spheroidal void, all
evolving jointly from initial linear perturbations at the last scattering era
into present day Mpc-size CDM structures. We show that CET entropy production
is positive for all times after last scattering at the precise spatial
locations where structure growth occurs and where the exact density growing
mode is dominant. The present paper provides the least idealized (and most
physically robust) probe of a gravitational entropy proposal in the context of

rate-optimal (up to a log factor) for a large family of RKHSs with regular
kernel eigenvalues. Interestingly, KRR does not require full knowledge of
likelihood ratios apart from an upper bound on them. In striking contrast to
the standard statistical setting without covariate shift, we also demonstrate
that a naive estimator, which minimizes the empirical risk over the function
class, is strictly sub-optimal under covariate shift as compared to KRR. We
then address the larger class of covariate shift problems where the likelihood
ratio is possibly unbounded yet has a finite second moment. Here, we propose a
reweighted KRR estimator that weights samples based on a careful truncation of
the likelihood ratios. Again, we are able to show that this estimator is
minimax rate-optimal, up to logarithmic factors.

mechanism for effective and efficient problem solving. The modeling of
multi-view point cloud registration as multi-task optimization are twofold. By
simultaneously considering the local accuracy of two point clouds as well as
the global consistency posed by all the point clouds involved, a fitness

co-evolutionary search process is defined for the concurrent optimization of
multiple fitness functions belonging to related tasks. To enhance solution
quality and convergence speed, the proposed bi-channel knowledge sharing
mechanism plays its role. The intra-task knowledge sharing introduces aiding
tasks that are much simpler to solve, and useful information is shared across
aiding tasks and the original tasks, accelerating the search process. The
inter-task knowledge sharing explores commonalities buried among the original
tasks, aiming to prevent tasks from getting stuck to local optima.

exploiting large unlabeled data through pseudolabeling. However, in the
extremely low-label regime, pseudo labels could be incorrect, a.k.a. the
confirmation bias, and the pseudo labels will in turn harm the network
training. Recent studies combined finetuning (FT) from pretrained weights with
SSL to mitigate the challenges and claimed superior results in the low-label
regime. In this work, we first show that the better pretrained weights brought
in by FT account for the state-of-the-art performance, and importantly that
they are universally helpful to off-the-shelf semi-supervised learners. We
further argue that direct finetuning from pretrained weights is suboptimal due
to covariate shift and propose a contrastive target pretraining step to adapt
model weights towards target dataset. We carried out extensive experiments on
both classification and segmentation tasks by doing target pretraining then
followed by semi-supervised finetuning. The promising results validate the
efficacy of target pretraining for SSL, in particular in the low-label regime.

are described by a non linear extension of the full Israel-Stewart model. We
allow the interchange of energy in the dark sector by means of the interaction
term, namely $Q$. We establish the dynamical system corresponding to Friedmann

stability of its critical points. From the dynamical system, we show the
appearance of a critical point characterizing a de Sitter universe within the
non interacting and interacting dark sector. We focus our study to analyse the
stability of this fixed point in a large region of parameter space and derive
linearized solutions around it. These approximate and analytical solutions are
potentially able to describe the expansion of the universe since they are close
to a de Sitter stationary solution. Within this regime with $Q \neq 0$, we
realize the existence of regions in the space of parameters where this critical
point is stable and describes the behavior of dark energy as quintessence,
cosmological constant and phantom like fluids. We perform a comparison between
numerical and linearized solutions nearby the critical points within the full
non linear regimes and also contrast them against $\Lambda$CDM model. We find
that fully non linear regime is favored by observations and closer to the
concordance model due to the non-zero value of the parameter $j$, which
controls the non linear effects. In fact, at low redshift values, the expansion
rate associated to the full non linear regime is practically indistinguishable

model paradigm for learning probabilities on infinite-dimensional function
spaces. The natural sciences and engineering are known to have many types of
data that are sampled from infinite-dimensional function spaces, where
classical finite-dimensional deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) may
not be directly applicable. GANO generalizes the GAN framework and allows for
the sampling of functions by learning push-forward operator maps in
infinite-dimensional spaces. GANO consists of two main components, a generator
neural operator and a discriminator neural functional. The inputs to the
generator are samples of functions from a user-specified probability measure,
e.g., Gaussian random field (GRF), and the generator outputs are synthetic data
functions. The input to the discriminator is either a real or synthetic data
function. In this work, we instantiate GANO using the Wasserstein criterion and
show how the Wasserstein loss can be computed in infinite-dimensional spaces.
We empirically study GANO in controlled cases where both input and output
functions are samples from GRFs and compare its performance to the
finite-dimensional counterpart GAN. We empirically study the efficacy of GANO
on real-world function data of volcanic activities and show its superior
performance over GAN.

Previous multiwavelength observation campaigns have indicated that its multiple
absorbers are highly variable and complex. A previous study applied a two-zone
partial covering model with different covering fractions to explain the complex
X-ray spectral variation and reported a correlation between one of the covering
fractions and the photon index of the power-law continuum. However, it is not
straightforward to physically understand such a correlation. In this paper, we
propose a model to avoid this unphysical situation; the central X-ray emission
region is partially covered by clumpy absorbers composed of double layers.
These ""double partial coverings"" have precisely the same covering fraction.
Based on our model, we have conducted an extensive spectral study using the
data taken by XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and NuSTAR in the range of 0.3-78 keV for 16
years. Consequently, we have found that the X-ray spectral variations are
mainly explained by independent changes of the following three components; (1)
the soft excess spectral component below ~1 keV, (2) the cut-off power-law
normalization, and (3) the partial covering fraction of the clumpy absorbers.
In particular, spectral variations above ~1 keV are mostly explained only by
the changes of the partial covering fraction and the power-law normalization.
In contrast, the photon index and all the other spectral parameters are not
significantly variable.

study accretion under extreme gravity and magnetic field conditions, but also
to probe still highly debated properties of massive star winds. These includes
the so-called clumps, originated from the inherent instability of line driven
winds, and larger structures. In this paper, we report on the results of the
last (and not yet published) monitoring campaigns that our group has been
carrying out since 2007 with both XMM-Newton and the Swift Neil Gehrels
observatory. Data collected with the EPIC cameras on-board XMM-Newton allow us
to carry out a detailed hardness ratio-resolved spectral analysis that can be
used as an efficient way to detect spectral variations associated to the
presence of clumps. Long-term observations with the XRT on-board Swift, evenly
sampling the X-ray emission of supergiant X-ray binaries over many different
orbital cycles, are exploited to look for the presence of large scale
structures in the medium surrounding the compact objects. The results reported
in this paper represent the outcomes of the concluded observational campaigns
we carried out on the supergiant X-ray binaries 4U 1907+09, IGR J16393-4643,
IGR J19140+0951, and XTE J1855-026, as well as the supergiant fast X-ray

are discussed in the context of wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries and shall
ideally serve to optimally shape the next observational campaigns aimed at

the asymptotic properties of the transition probabilities of the so-called

both dialect information and its internal representation, which results in a
highly adaptive AM for handling multiple dialects simultaneously. We also

anatomical structures and actively avoid potential complications while
achieving the main task at hand. Such surgical activity has been shown to

whose mechanics remain unknown for the majority of surgical procedures, we
hypothesize that the core elements of surgery must first be quantified in a
reliable, objective, and scalable manner. We believe this is a prerequisite for
the provision of surgical feedback and modulation of surgeon performance in
pursuit of improved patient outcomes. To holistically quantify surgeries, we
propose a unified deep learning framework, entitled Roboformer, which operates
exclusively on videos recorded during surgery to independently achieve multiple
tasks: surgical phase recognition (the what of surgery), gesture classification
and skills assessment (the how of surgery). We validated our framework on four
video-based datasets of two commonly-encountered types of steps (dissection and
suturing) within minimally-invasive robotic surgeries. We demonstrated that our
framework can generalize well to unseen videos, surgeons, medical centres, and
surgical procedures. We also found that our framework, which naturally lends
itself to explainable findings, identified relevant information when achieving

confidence in our framework's behaviour, increasing the likelihood of clinical
adoption, and thus paving the way for more targeted surgical feedback.

multivariate observational time-series. Such data may be represented by graphs,
where nodes represent time-series, and edges directed causal influence scores
between them. If the number of nodes exceeds the number of temporal
observations, conventional methods, such as standard Granger causality, are of
limited value, because estimating free parameters of time-series predictors
lead to underdetermined problems. A typical example for this situation is
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), where the number of nodal
observations is large, usually ranging from $10^2$ to $10^5$ time-series, while
the number of temporal observations is low, usually less than $10^3$. Hence,
innovative approaches are required to address the challenges arising from such
data sets. Recently, we have proposed the large-scale Extended Granger
Causality (lsXGC) algorithm, which is based on augmenting a
dimensionality-reduced representation of the system's state-space by
supplementing data from the conditional source time-series taken from the
original input space. Here, we apply lsXGC on synthetic fMRI data with known

leveraging the benefits of information-theoretic approaches. Our results
suggest that the proposed lsXGC method significantly outperforms existing

variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). However, the accuracy and trainability
of the current VQE algorithm are significantly influenced due to the barren
plateau (BP), the non-negligible gate error and limited coherence time in NISQ
devices. To tackle these issues, a gradient-sensitive alternate framework with
variable ansatz is proposed in this paper to enhance the performance of the
VQE. We first propose a theoretical framework for VA-VQE via alternately
solving a multi-objective optimization problem and the original VQE, where the
multi-objective optimization problem is defined with respect to cost function
values and gradient magnitudes. Then, we propose a novel implementation method
based on the double $\epsilon$-greedy strategy with the candidate tree and

avoided both in ansatz and parameter perspectives, and the stability of output
ansatz is enhanced. The experimental results indicate that our framework shows
considerably improvement of the error of the found solution by up to 87.9%
compared with the hardware-efficient ansatz. Furthermore, compared with the
full-randomized VA-VQE implementation, our framework is able to obtain the
improvement of the error and the stability by up to 36.0% and 58.7%,

few studies have considered a malicious server that deviates from the protocol,
they ignore the verification of model accuracy (where the malicious server uses
a low-quality model) meanwhile preserving the privacy of both the server's

\textit{Fusion}, where the client mixes the public samples (which have known
query results) with their own samples to be queried as the inputs of
multi-party computation to jointly perform the secure inference. Since a server
that uses a low-quality model or deviates from the protocol can only produce

method based on convergence guarantees of quantum imaginary time evolution. To
investigate the performance of our algorithm and its potential advantages, we
tackle a challenging real-world optimization problem: feature selection. This
refers to the problem of selecting a subset of relevant features to use for
constructing a predictive model such as fraud detection. Optimal feature
selection -- when formulated in terms of a generic loss function -- offers
little structure on which to build classical heuristics, thus resulting
primarily in 'greedy methods'. This leaves room for (near-term) quantum
algorithms to be competitive to classical state-of-the-art approaches. We apply
our quantum-optimization-based feature selection algorithm, termed VarQFS, to
build a predictive model for a credit risk data set with 20 and 59 input

tensor-network-based numerical simulations, respectively. We show that the

results indicate that Ba$_2$NiIrO$_6$ has the Ni$^{2+}$

contradicts the experimental antiferromagnetic (AF) order in Ba$_2$NiIrO$_6$.
We find that the strong 2NN AF couplings are frustrated in the fcc sublattices,

prove that the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 3/2 and $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 states induced by

robot model, circle formation on infinite grid has also been studied. In this
paper, we are solving $\mathcal{APF}$ on infinite grid with asynchronous opaque
robots with lights. The robots do not share any global co-ordinate system. The
main challenge in this problem is to elect a leader to agree upon a global
co-ordinate where the vision of the robots are obstructed by other robots.
Since the robots are on a grid, their movements are also restricted to avoid
collisions. In this paper, the aforementioned hardness are overcome to produce
an algorithm that solves the problem.

waveguide array in which the lengths of the waveguides are designed for both
wavelength separation and beam focusing. The facet of the chip is diced open so
that the outputs of the array form a near-field emitter. The far field are

determine which experience is available and useful, a prototypical task

of infinite-state systems whose configurations can be represented as finite
words over a suitable alphabet. It applies to systems whose set of initial
configurations is regular, and whose transition relation is captured by a
length-preserving transducer. To verify safety properties, regular model
checking iteratively computes automata recognizing increasingly larger regular
sets of reachable configurations, and checks if they contain unsafe
configurations. Since this procedure often does not terminate, acceleration,
abstraction, and widening techniques have been developed to compute a regular
superset of the set of reachable configurations.
  In this paper we develop a complementary approach. Instead of approaching the
set of reachable configurations from below, we start with the set of all
configurations and compute increasingly smaller regular supersets of it. We use
that the set of reachable configurations is equal to the intersection of all
inductive invariants of the system. Since the intersection is in general
non-regular, we introduce $b$-bounded invariants, defined as those
representable by CNF-formulas with at most $b$ clauses. We prove that, for
every $b \geq 0$, the intersection of all $b$-bounded inductive invariants is
regular, and show how to construct an automaton recognizing it. We study the
complexity of deciding if this automaton accepts some unsafe configuration. We
show that the problem is in \textsc{EXPSPACE} for every $b \geq 0$, and
\textsc{PSPACE}-complete for $b=1$. Finally, we study how large must $b$ be to
prove safety properties of a number of benchmarks.

investigate the evolution of merger-free star-forming systems. These models are
fitted directly to galaxies' absorption-line spectra, while their emission
lines are used to constrain current gas phase metallicity and star formation
rate. We apply this method to spiral galaxies selected from the SDSS-IV MaNGA
survey. By fitting the co-added absorption-line spectra for each galaxy, and
using the emission-line constraints on present-day metallicity and star
formation, we reconstruct both the SFHs and the ChEHs for all objects in the
sample. We can use these reconstructions to obtain archaeological measures of
derived correlations such as the mass--metallicity relation at any redshift,
which compare favourably with direct observations. We find that both the SFHs
and ChEHs have strong mass dependence: massive galaxies accumulate their
stellar masses and become enriched earlier. This mass dependence causes the
observed flattening of the mass--metallicity relation at lower redshifts. The
model also reproduces the observed gas-to-stellar mass ratio and its mass
dependence. Moreover, we are able to determine that more massive galaxies have
earlier gas infall times and shorter infall time-scales, and that the early
chemical enrichment of low-mass galaxies is suppressed by strong outflows,
while outflows are not very significant in massive galaxies.

Simultaneously, rich semantics from the external knowledge base (KB) and the

conquer the COVID-19 disease is now competing with the emergence of
increasingly contagious mutations, repeatedly supplanting earlier strains.
Following the near-absence of historical examples of the long-time evolution of
infectious diseases under similar circumstances, models are crucial to
exemplify possible scenarios. Accordingly, in the present work we
systematically generalize the popular susceptible-infected-recovered model to
account for mutations leading to repeatedly occurring new strains, which we
coarse grain based on tools from statistical mechanics to derive a model
predicting the most likely outcomes. The model predicts that mutations can
induce a super-exponential growth of infection numbers at early times, which
self-amplify to giant infection waves which are caused by a positive feedback
loop between infection numbers and mutations and lead to a simultaneous
infection of the majority of the population. At later stage -- if vaccination
progresses too slowly -- mutations can interrupt an ongoing decrease of
infection numbers and can cause infection revivals which occur as single waves
or even as whole wave trains featuring alternative periods of decreasing and
increasing infection numbers. This panorama of possible mutation-induced
scenarios should be tested in more detailed models to explore their concrete
significance for specific infectious diseases. Further, our results might be
useful for discussions regarding the importance of a release of vaccine-patents
to reduce the risk of mutation-induced infection revivals but also to
coordinate the release of measures following a downwards trend of infection
numbers.

includes an evolving microstructure. Such type of problems model, for example,
mineral dissolution and precipitation in a porous medium. Hence, we are dealing
with a multi-scale problem with free boundaries on the pore scale. In the
initial state the microscopic geometry is given by a periodically perforated
domain, including spherical solid grains. The radius of each grain is of order
$\epsilon$ and depends on the unknown (the solute concentration) at its
surface. Therefore the radii of the grains change in time, leading to a
nonlinear, free boundary problem. In a first step, we transform the evolving
micro domain to a fixed, periodically domain. Using the Rothe-method we prove
the existence of a weak solution and obtain a priori estimates that are uniform
with respect to $\epsilon$. Finally, letting $\epsilon \to 0$, we derive a
macroscopic model, the solution of which approximates the micro-scale solution.
For this, we use the method of two-scale convergence, and obtain strong
compactness results enabling to pass to the limit in the nonlinear terms.

vector that is made up of either a quantity of interest (unsupervised case) or
the couple of the quantity of interest and a control parameter (supervised
case). A training set of independent realizations of this random vector is
assumed to be given and to be generated with a prior probability measure that
is unknown. A target set of realizations of the QoI is available for the two
considered cases. The framework is the one of non-Gaussian problems in high
dimension. A functional approach is developed on the basis of a weak
formulation of the Fourier transform of probability measures (characteristic
functions). The construction makes it possible to take into account the target
set of realizations of the QoI in the Kullback-Leibler minimum principle. The
proposed approach allows for estimating the posterior probability measure of

has been developed rapidly. Task offloading is a key part of edge computing
that can provide computing resources for resource-constrained devices to run
computing-intensive applications, accelerate computing speed and save energy.
An efficient and feasible task offloading scheme can not only greatly improve
the quality of experience (QoE) but also provide strong support and assistance
for 5G/B5G networks, the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), computing
networks and so on. To achieve these goals, this paper proposes an adaptive
edge task offloading scheme assisted by service deployment (SD-AETO) focusing
on the optimization of the energy utilization ratio (EUR) and the processing
latency. In the pre-implementation stage of the SD-AETO scheme, a service
deployment scheme is invoked to assist with task offloading considering each
service's popularity. The optimal service deployment scheme is obtained by
using the approximate deployment graph (AD-graph). Furthermore, a task
scheduling and queue offloading design procedure is proposed to complete the
SD-AETO scheme based on the task priority. The task priority is generated by
the corresponding service popularity and task offloading direction. Finally, we
analyze our SD-AETO scheme and compare it with related approaches, and the
results show that our scheme has a higher edge offloading rate and lower
resource consumption for massive task scenarios in the edge network.

fading, which is one of the most challenging problems in wireless
communications due to the randomness of the wireless channel. However, existing
diversity techniques are resource-inefficient due to orthogonal resource usage,
or they have high-power consumption due to multiple antennas and RF-chains
which present an insurmountable constraint for small devices. To address this,
this letter proposes a novel resource-efficient diversity technique called
power-time channel diversity (PTCD). In PTCD, interleaved copies of the
baseband symbols are transmitted simultaneously with weighted power
coefficients. The PTCD provides a diversity order of the number of copies by
implementing successive interference canceler at the receiver. To achieve this
diversity, no additional resources are needed; hence, spectral efficient
communication is guaranteed. Additionally, the power consumption at the
transceivers is limited since the PTCD requires only one RF-chain. We provide
an information-theoretic proof that the PTCD could have any diversity order.
Based on extensive simulations, we reveal that PTCD can also outperform
benchmarks without any additional cost.

economic framework with a large number of agents into a field-formalism model.
This type of formalism allows the analytical treatment of economic models with
an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions and
microeconomic features of the individual level.We apply this methodology to
model the interactions between financial markets and the real economy,
described in a classical framework of a large number of heterogeneous agents,
investors and firms. Firms are spread among sectors but may shift between
sectors to improve their returns. They compete by producing differentiated
goods and reward their investors by paying dividends and through their stocks'
valuation. Investors invest in firms and move along sectors based on firms'
expected long-run returns.The field-formalism model derived from this framework
allows for collective states to emerge. We show that the number of firms in
each sector depends on the aggregate financial capital invested in the sector
and its firms' expected long-term returns. Capital accumulation in each sector
depends both on short-term returns and expected long-term returns relative to
neighbouring sectors.For each sector, three patterns of accumulation emerge. In
the first pattern, the dividend component of short-term returns is determinant
for sectors with small number of firms and low capital. In the second pattern,
both short and long-term returns in the sector drive intermediate-to-high
capital. In the third pattern, higher expectations of long-term returns drive
massive inputs of capital.Instability in capital accumulation may arise among
and within sectors. We therefore widen our approach and study the dynamics of
the collective configurations, in particular interactions between average
capital and expected long-term returns, and show that overall stability
crucially depends on the expectations' formation process.Expectations that are
highly reactive to capital variations stabilize high capital configurations,
and drive low-to-moderate capital sectors towards zero or a higher level of
capital, depending on their initial capital. Inversely, low-to moderate capital
configurations are stabilized by expectations moderately reactive to capital
variations, and drive high capital sectors towards more moderate level of
capital equilibria.Eventually, the combination of expectations both highly
sensitive to exogenous conditions and highly reactive to variations in capital
imply that large fluctuations of capital in the system, at the possible expense
of the real economy.

limit, called strong gravitomagnetism, which has corrections in c of the same
order as the Newtonian terms. We show that these two limits of the general
class of solution can account for the observed flat velocity profile, contrary
to what happens using Newtonian models, where a dark matter contribution is
required. Hence, we suggest a geometrical origin for a certain amount of dark
matter effects.

more and more applications and services in our daily life. This has led to
growing concerns over user privacy, since human interaction data typically

ML models on edge devices using sensitive user data and is seen as a way to
mitigate concerns over data privacy. However, since ML models are most commonly
trained with label supervision, we need a way to extract labels on edge to make
FL viable. In this work, we propose a strategy for training FL models using
positive and negative user feedback. We also design a novel framework to study
different noise patterns in user feedback, and explore how well standard
noise-robust objectives can help mitigate this noise when training models in a
federated setting. We evaluate our proposed training setup through detailed
experiments on two text classification datasets and analyze the effects of
varying levels of user reliability and feedback noise on model performance. We
show that our method improves substantially over a self-training baseline,
achieving performance closer to models trained with full supervision.

making use of the rescaling approach as a main tool for dealing with the
multiple noise, where we need to take advantage of a slight modification of the
deterministic Strichartz estimate to fit into requirements under the setting of
$H^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The other difficulty lies on the discussion on smoothness
of functions in the nonlinear term, where the proof of time local
well-posedness for the case of $H^2$-solutions does not go similarly as in the
cases of $L^2$-solutions or $H^1$-solutions, because of the complexity in the
computation of the nonlinear term with lower exponent $\alpha$. The techniques
of Kato [18,19] work well on this difficulty even for the stochastic equations.
We use the stochastic Strichartz estimate [4,16,17] as well to deal with white
noise which did not appear in the proof for $L^2$-solutions or $H^1$-solutions.

underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. In this paper, we present 2D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of two current-carrying magnetic flux
ropes with an out-of-plane magnetic field undergoing oscillatory reconnection
in which the two flux ropes merge into a single flux rope. We find that
oscillatory reconnection can occur intrinsically without an external
oscillatory driver during flux rope coalescence, which may occur both during
large-scale coronal loop interactions and the merging of plasmoids in
fragmented current sheets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that radially
propagating non-linear waves are produced in the aftermath of flux rope
coalescence, due to the post-reconnection oscillations of the merged flux rope.
The behaviour of these waves is found to be almost independent of the initial
out-of-plane magnetic field. It is estimated that the waves emitted through
merging coronal loops and merging plasmoids in loop-top current sheets would
have a typical phase speed of 90 km/s and 900 km/s respectively. It is possible
that the properties of the waves emitted during flux rope coalescence could be

to a known event from the literature, detected on the young dMe star V374 Peg.
This event manifests itself in extra emission on the blue side of the Balmer

  Galactic plane sources","Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac704f",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cosmic rays are mostly composed of protons accelerated to relativistic
speeds. When those protons encounter interstellar material, they produce
neutral pions which in turn decay into gamma rays. This offers a compelling way
to identify the acceleration sites of protons. A characteristic hadronic
spectrum, with a low-energy break around 200 MeV, was detected in the gamma-ray
spectra of four Supernova Remnants (SNRs), IC 443, W44, W49B and W51C, with the
Fermi Large Area Telescope. This detection provided direct evidence that
cosmic-ray protons are (re-)accelerated in SNRs. Here, we present a
comprehensive search for low-energy spectral breaks among 311 4FGL catalog
sources located within 5 degrees from the Galactic plane. Using 8 years of data
from the Fermi Large Area Telescope between 50 MeV and 1 GeV, we find and
present the spectral characteristics of 56 sources with a spectral break
confirmed by a thorough study of systematic uncertainty. Our population of
sources includes 13 SNRs for which the proton-proton interaction is enhanced by
the dense target material; the high-mass gamma-ray binary LS~I +61 303; the
colliding wind binary eta Carinae; and the Cygnus star-forming region. This
analysis better constrains the origin of the gamma-ray emission and enlarges
our view to potential new cosmic-ray acceleration sites.

intelligence (EI), the explosive growth of data on the edge of the network has
promoted the rapid development of 6G and ubiquitous intelligence (UbiI). This
article aims to explore a new method for modeling latency guarantees for UbiI
in 6G given 6G's extremely stochastic nature in terahertz (THz) environments,
THz channel tail behavior, and delay distribution tail characteristics
generated by the UBiI random component, and to find the optimal solution that
minimizes the end-to-end (E2E) delay of UbiI. In this article, the arrival
curve and service curve of network calculus can well characterize the
stochastic nature of wireless channels, the tail behavior of wireless systems
and the E2E service curve of network calculus can model the tail characteristic
of the delay distribution in UbiI. Specifically, we first propose demands and
challenges facing 6G, edge computing (EC), edge deep learning (DL), and UbiI.
Then, we propose the hierarchical architecture, the network model, and the
service delay model of the UbiI system based on network calculus. In addition,
two case studies demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the network

and mortality. Fitness is directly measured as maximal oxygen consumption
(VO$_{2}max$), or indirectly assessed using heart rate responses to standard
exercise tests. However, such testing is costly and burdensome because it
requires specialized equipment such as treadmills and oxygen masks, limiting
its utility. Modern wearables capture dynamic real-world data which could
improve fitness prediction. In this work, we design algorithms and models that
convert raw wearable sensor data into cardiorespiratory fitness estimates. We
validate these estimates' ability to capture fitness profiles in free-living
conditions using the Fenland Study (N=11,059), along with its longitudinal
cohort (N=2,675), and a third external cohort using the UK Biobank Validation
Study (N=181) who underwent maximal VO$_{2}max$ testing, the gold standard
measurement of fitness. Our results show that the combination of wearables and
other biomarkers as inputs to neural networks yields a strong correlation to
ground truth in a holdout sample (r = 0.82, 95CI 0.80-0.83), outperforming
other approaches and models and detects fitness change over time (e.g., after 7
years). We also show how the model's latent space can be used for fitness-aware
patient subtyping paving the way to scalable interventions and personalized
trial recruitment. These results demonstrate the value of wearables for fitness

where the optimal operating behavior is periodic. In such a setting, the
performance of a standard economic MPC scheme without terminal conditions can
generally be far from optimal even with arbitrarily long prediction horizons.
Whereas there are modified economic MPC schemes that guarantee optimal
performance, all of them are based on prior knowledge of the optimal period
length or of the optimal periodic orbit itself. In contrast to these
approaches, we propose to achieve optimality by multiplying the stage cost by a
linear discount factor. This modification is not only easy to implement but
also independent of any system- or cost-specific properties, making the scheme
robust against online changes therein. Under standard dissipativity and
controllability assumptions, we can prove that the resulting linearly
discounted economic MPC without terminal conditions achieves optimal asymptotic
average performance up to an error that vanishes with growing prediction
horizons. Moreover, we can guarantee practical asymptotic stability of the
optimal periodic orbit under the additional technical assumption that
dissipativity holds with a continuous storage function. We complement these
qualitative guarantees with a quantitative analysis of the transient and
asymptotic average performance of the linearly discounted MPC scheme in a
numerical simulation study.

camera information, temporal information and spatial information. By analyzing
the style bias of cameras, the characteristics of pedestrians' motion
trajectories and the positions of camera network, this paper designs three
modules: Time-Overlapping Constraint (TOC), Spatio-Temporal Similarity (STS)
and Same-Camera Penalty (SCP) to exploit the auxiliary information. Auxiliary
information can improve the model performance and inference accuracy by
constructing association constraints or fusing with visual features. In
addition, this paper proposes three effective training tricks, including
Restricted Label Smoothing Cross Entropy Loss (RLSCE), Weight Adaptive Triplet
Loss (WATL) and Dynamic Training Iterations (DTI). The tricks achieve mAP of

auxiliary information exploiting modules, our methods achieve mAP of 89.9% on
DukeMTMC, where TOC, STS and SCP all contributed considerable performance
improvements. The method proposed by this paper outperforms most existing

improved training efficiency and better generalization over previously unseen

generalization error of a learning algorithm can be upper bounded by
information measures. In most of the relevant works, the convergence rate of
the expected generalization error is in the form of O(sqrt{lambda/n}) where
lambda is some information-theoretic quantities such as the mutual information
between the data sample and the learned hypothesis. However, such a learning
rate is typically considered to be ""slow"", compared to a ""fast rate"" of O(1/n)
in many learning scenarios. In this work, we first show that the square root
does not necessarily imply a slow rate, and a fast rate (O(1/n)) result can
still be obtained using this bound under appropriate assumptions. Furthermore,
we identify the key conditions needed for the fast rate generalization error,
which we call the (eta,c)-central condition. Under this condition, we give
information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error and excess risk, with
a convergence rate of O(\lambda/{n}) for specific learning algorithms such as
empirical risk minimization. Finally, analytical examples are given to show the
effectiveness of the bounds.

matching plays an indispensable role in 3D shape recovery, AR, VR, and
navigation tasks. Although numerous Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches are
proposed, the conventional prior-free approaches are still popular in the
industry because of the lack of open-source annotated data set and the
limitation of the task-specific pre-trained DNNs. Among the prior-free stereo
matching algorithms, there is no successful real-time algorithm in none GPU
environment for MIS. This paper proposes the first CPU-level real-time
prior-free stereo matching algorithm for general MIS tasks. We achieve an
average 17 Hz on 640*480 images with a single-core CPU (i5-9400) for surgical
images. Meanwhile, it achieves slightly better accuracy than the popular ELAS.
The patch-based fast disparity searching algorithm is adopted for the rectified
stereo images. A coarse-to-fine Bayesian probability and a spatial Gaussian
mixed model were proposed to evaluate the patch probability at different
scales. An optional probability density function estimation algorithm was
adopted to quantify the prediction variance. Extensive experiments demonstrated
the proposed method's capability to handle ambiguities introduced by the
textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency from the non-Lambertian
reflectance and dark illumination. The estimated probability managed to balance
the confidences of the patches for stereo images at different scales. It has
similar or higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline ELAS in MIS,
while it is 4-5 times faster. The code and the synthetic data sets are
available at https://github.com/JingweiSong/BDIS-v2.

a multi-prototype classifier, each prototype serves as the classifier weights

weights, we propose two constraints respectively for updating the prototypes
w.r.t. all point features and for encouraging the learning of diverse

validate the efficacy of proposed method in particular at low-label regime. Our

Adopting certain hyperfluid models, with non-vanishing hypermomentum that can
source spacetime non-metricity, we add a matter component into the action and
derive the field equations, along with the conservation laws. Applying our
formulae to cosmology, we generalize the Friedmann and the Raychaudhuri

equation of state. For instance, specific types of hypermomentum are found to
act as an effective stiff fluid, thus opening the possibility that
non-metricity could have played a significant role in the early stages of the

universal dynamics at late times. In either case, the equilibrium moment
depends on the initial conditions and it is determined by a simple relation
between the matter component and the hyperfluid.

in intelligent human-computer interaction system. Although VQA in computer
vision has been widely researched, VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA) is still
in its infancy. There are two characteristics that need to be specially

datasets, which makes it difficult for models to exploit informative region
representation; 2) There are questions with clearly different difficulty levels
for each image in the RSVQA task. Directly training a model with questions in a
random order may confuse the model and limit the performance. To address these
two problems, in this paper, a multi-level visual feature learning method is
proposed to jointly extract language-guided holistic and regional image
features. Besides, a self-paced curriculum learning (SPCL)-based VQA model is
developed to train networks with samples in an easy-to-hard way. To be more

Strict causality is ensured as circuit wires coincide with the lightlike

construction replays the logic that leads to the QED Lagrangian. Namely, it
starts from the Dirac quantum walk, well-known to converge towards free
relativistic fermions. It then extends the quantum walk into a multi-particle
sector quantum cellular automata in a way which respects the fermionic
anti-commutation relations and the discrete gauge invariance symmetry. Both

towards the realization of energy-efficient spintronics devices and

micro-patterned electrodes in solid-state devices adds the possibility to
modify magnetic properties locally, in a non-volatile and reversible way.
Tuning magnetic anisotropy, magnetization and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
allows modifying at will the dynamics of non trivial magnetic textures such as
skyrmions and chiral domain walls in magnetic race tracks. In this work, we
illustrate efficient magneto-ionic effects in a ferrimagnetic Pt/Co/Tb stack
using a ZrO2 thin layer as a solid state ionic conductor. When a thin layer of
terbium is deposited on top of cobalt, it acquires a magnetic moment that
aligns antiparallel to that of cobalt, reducing the effective magnetization.
Below the micro-patterned electrodes, the voltage-driven migration of oxygen
ions in a ZrO2 towards the ferrimagnetic stack partially oxidizes the Tb layer,
leading to the local variation not only of the spontaneous magnetization, but
also of the effective magnetic anisotropy and of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction. This leads to a huge increase of the domain wall velocity, which
varies from 10 m/s in the pristine state to 250 m/s after gating. This
non-volatile and reversible tuning of the domain wall dynamics may lead to
applications to reprogrammable magnetic memories or other spintronic devices.

to guarantee low latency and high availability. It is widely accepted that
programming over eventually consistent data stores is challenging, since
arbitrary divergence among replicas is allowed. Moreover, pragmatic protocols
actually achieve consistency guarantees stronger than eventual consistency,
which can be and need to be utilized to facilitate the reasoning of and
programming over replicated data types. Toward the challenges above, we propose
the ViSearch framework for precise measurement of eventual consistency
semantics. ViSearch employs the visibility-arbitration specification
methodology in concurrent programming, which extends the linearizability-based
specification methodology with a dynamic visibility relation among operations,
in addition to the standard dynamic happen-before and linearization relations.
The consistency measurement using ViSearch is NP-hard in general. To enable
practical and efficient consistency measurement in replicated data type stores,
the ViSearch framework refactors the existing brute-force checking algorithm to
a generic algorithm skeleton, which further enables efficient pruning of the
search space and effective parallelization. We employ the ViSearch framework
for consistency measurement in two replicated data type stores Riak and
CRDT-Redis. The experimental evaluation shows the usefulness and
cost-effectiveness of consistency measurement based on the ViSearch framework

backtracking - beside often being desirable - can actually be enabled by the
archive. Through low-dimensional/analytical examples, we show that a key effect
of the archive is that it counterbalances the exploration biases that result,
among other factors, from the use of inadequate behavior metrics and the

attributing a more active role to the archive in sampling can be beneficial.

were proposed to be due to the time-varying component of the stellar
gravitational quadrupole moment. This is suggested to be produced by changes in
the stellar structure due to an internal redistribution of angular momentum and
the effect of the centrifugal force. We examined this hypothesis and present 3D
simulations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) performed with the {\sc
Pencil Code}. We modeled the stellar dynamo for a solar-mass star with angular
velocities of 20 and 30 times solar. We included and varied the strength of the
centrifugal force and compared the results with reference simulations without
the centrifugal force and with a simulation in which its effect is enhanced.
The centrifugal force causes perturbations in the evolution of the numerical
model, so that the outcome in the details becomes different as a result of
nonlinear evolution. While the average density profile is unaffected by the
centrifugal force, a relative change in the density difference between high
latitudes and the equator of $\sim10^{-4}$ is found. The power spectrum of the
convective velocity is found to be more sensitive to the angular velocity than
to the strength of the centrifugal force. The quadrupole moment of the stars
includes a fluctuating and a time-independent component, which vary with the
rotation rate. As very similar behavior is produced in absence of the
centrifugal force, we conclude that it is not the main ingredient for producing
the time-averaged and fluctuating quadrupole moment of the star. In a real
physical system, we thus expect contributions from both components, that is,
from the time-dependent gravitational force from the variation in the
quadrupole term and from the spin-orbit coupling that is due to the persistent
part of the quadrupole.

bandgap than its bulk counterpart, an unusual trend in LMs. We also
systematically study the basic properties of ultrathin phlogopite and
demonstrate that natural phlogopite presents iron impurities in its crystal
lattice, which decreases its bandgap from about 7 eV to 3.6 eV. Finally, we
combine phlogopite crystals with 1L-WS2 in ultrathin van der Waals

enhancement on the 1L-WS2 optical quality (i.e., higher recombination
efficiency through neutral excitons) similarly to that obtained on 1L-WS2/hBN

federated learning for chest X-ray classification as a defense against data
privacy attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to directly
compare the impact of differentially private training on two different neural
network architectures, DenseNet121 and ResNet50. Extending the federated
learning environments previously analyzed in terms of privacy, we simulated a
heterogeneous and imbalanced federated setting by distributing images from the
public CheXpert and Mendeley chest X-ray datasets unevenly among 36 clients.
Both non-private baseline models achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) of $0.94$ on the binary classification task of
detecting the presence of a medical finding. We demonstrate that both model
architectures are vulnerable to privacy violation by applying image
reconstruction attacks to local model updates from individual clients. The
attack was particularly successful during later training stages. To mitigate
the risk of privacy breach, we integrated R\'enyi differential privacy with a
Gaussian noise mechanism into local model training. We evaluate model
performance and attack vulnerability for privacy budgets $\epsilon \in$ {1, 3,
6, 10}. The DenseNet121 achieved the best utility-privacy trade-off with an AUC
of $0.94$ for $\epsilon$ = 6. Model performance deteriorated slightly for
individual clients compared to the non-private baseline. The ResNet50 only
reached an AUC of $0.76$ in the same privacy setting. Its performance was
inferior to that of the DenseNet121 for all considered privacy constraints,
suggesting that the DenseNet121 architecture is more robust to differentially
private training.

secret events in a given system, concealability holds if the occurrence of all
secret events remains hidden to a curious observer (an eavesdropper). A secret
event is said to be (at least under some executions) unconcealable (inferable)
if its occurrence can be indirectly determined with certainty after a finite
number of observations. When concealability of a system does not hold (i.e.,
one or more secret events are unconcealable), we analyze how a defender, placed
at the interface of the system with the eavesdropper, can be used to enforce
concealability. The defender takes as input each observed event of the system
and outputs a carefully modified event sequence (seen by the eavesdropper)
using event deletion, insertion, or replacement. The defender is said to be
C-enforceable if, following the occurrence of the secret events and regardless

to manipulate observations and conceal the events perpetually. We discuss

in the outer penumbra, approaching 0.5 km/s. This speed is also typical of an
expansion of the penumbra-granulation border during periods that typically last
one hour and are followed by a fast contraction. The majority of the G-band
bright points moves away from the sunspot, with a typical speed of 0.6 km/s.
High outward speeds, 3.6 km/s on average, are observed in dark bodies of
penumbral filaments. According to the model of penumbral filaments, it is
suggested that the speeds detected in the dark bodies of filaments are
associated with the Evershed flow and that the opposite directions of PG
motions in the inner and outer penumbrae may be explained by the interaction of
rising plasma in filament heads with a surrounding, differently inclined
magnetic field.

performed only on the links. Due to this, some new authentication and key

(MNOPs) for key exchange to mitigate the risk of an attack on a trusted node.
The scope of the article is to perform a security analysis of this scheme for
the case of both uncorrelated attacks and correlated attacks with finite

Overlapping Paths (MOPs). We prove that introducing overlapping paths allows
one to increase the security of the protocol, compared to the non-overlapping

application in optimising architectures of large-scale (hybrid) quantum

Rayleigh number quantifying the strength of internal heating and $c = 216$.
Then, $\overline{\langle wT \rangle} = 0$ corresponds to vertical heat
transport by conduction alone, while $\overline{\langle wT \rangle} > 0$
represents the enhancement of vertical heat transport upwards due to convective
motion. If, instead, the lower boundary is a thermal insulator, then we obtain
$\overline{\langle wT \rangle} \leq \frac12 - c R^{-4}$, with $c\approx
0.0107$. This result implies that the Nusselt number $Nu$, defined as the ratio

bounds are obtained by combining the background method with a minimum principle
for the fluid's temperature and with Hardy--Rellich inequalities to exploit the

valid at both infinite and finite Prandtl numbers, approach the uniform bound

frequency, peak power density and polarization direction. While spin-orbit
coupling is found to result in only a small time-dependent reduction of
magnetization (less than 10%), we find a marked anisotropy in the response to
in-plane and out-of-plane polarized light, which changes its character
qualitatively depending on the excitation energy: the Fe-layer is efficiently
addressed at low frequencies by in-plane polarized light, whereas for
frequencies higher than the MgO band gap, we find a particularly strong
response of the central MgO-layer for cross-plane polarized light. For laser
excitations between the charge transfer gap and the MgO band gap, the interface
plays the most important role, as it mediates concerted transitions from the
valence band of MgO into the $3d$ states of Fe closely above the Fermi level
and from the Fe-states below the Fermi level into the conduction band of MgO.
As these transitions can occur simultaneously altering charge balance of the
layers, they could potentially lead to an efficient transfer of excited
carriers into the MgO bulk, where the corresponding electron and hole states
can be separated by an energy which is significantly larger than the photon

In the backdoor attack scenario, attackers usually implant the backdoor into
the target model by manipulating the training dataset or training process.
Then, the compromised model behaves normally for benign input yet makes
mistakes when the pre-defined trigger appears. In this paper, we analyze the
drawbacks of existing attack approaches and propose a novel imperceptible
backdoor attack. We treat the trigger pattern as a special kind of noise
following a multinomial distribution. A U-net-based network is employed to
generate concrete parameters of multinomial distribution for each benign input.
This elaborated trigger ensures that our approach is invisible to both humans
and statistical detection. Besides the design of the trigger, we also consider
the robustness of our approach against model diagnose-based defences. We force
the feature representation of malicious input stamped with the trigger to be
entangled with the benign one. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness

we removed constraints related to the communication protocol of the robots and
simplified the control mechanisms regulating the transitions between states of
the probabilistic controller. The results show that the performances obtained
with the previous, more complex, controller can be replicated with our
simplified approach which offers clear advantages in terms of portability to
the physical robots and in terms of flexibility. That is, our simplified
approach can generate self-organized aggregation responses in a larger set of
operating conditions than what can be achieved with the complex controller.

However, existing LfD methods are typically insufficient, yielding policies
that frequently collide or drive off the road. To address this problem, we
propose Symphony, which greatly improves realism by combining conventional
policies with a parallel beam search. The beam search refines these policies on
the fly by pruning branches that are unfavourably evaluated by a discriminator.
However, it can also harm diversity, i.e., how well the agents cover the entire
distribution of realistic behaviour, as pruning can encourage mode collapse.
Symphony addresses this issue with a hierarchical approach, factoring agent
behaviour into goal generation and goal conditioning. The use of such goals
ensures that agent diversity neither disappears during adversarial training nor
is pruned away by the beam search. Experiments on both proprietary and open
Waymo datasets confirm that Symphony agents learn more realistic and diverse

and optimal high-order methods for solving smooth and monotone variational
inequalities (VIs). A VI involves finding $x^\star \in \mathcal{X}$ such that
$\langle F(x), x - x^\star\rangle \geq 0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and we
consider the setting in which $F: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}^d$ is smooth
with up to $(p-1)^{th}$-order derivatives. For $p = 2$, the cubic regularized
Newton's method has been extended to VIs with a global rate of
$O(\epsilon^{-1})$. An improved rate of
$O(\epsilon^{-2/3}\log\log(1/\epsilon))$ can be obtained via an alternative
second-order method, but this method requires a nontrivial line-search
procedure as an inner loop. Similarly, high-order methods based on similar
line-search procedures have been shown to achieve a rate of
$O(\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)}\log\log(1/\epsilon))$, but the inner loop requires
fine-tuning of parameters and can be computationally complex. As highlighted by
Nesterov, it would be desirable to develop a simple high-order VI method that
retains the optimality of the more complex methods. We propose a $p^{th}$-order
method that does \textit{not} require any search procedure and provably
converges to a weak solution at a rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)})$. We prove
that our $p^{th}$-order method is optimal in the monotone setting by
establishing a lower bound of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)})$ under a linear span
assumption. A version with restarting attains a global linear and local
superlinear convergence rate for smooth and strongly monotone VIs. Furthermore,
our method achieves a global rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2/p})$ for solving smooth
and nonmonotone VIs satisfying the Minty condition. The restarted version again
attains a global linear and local superlinear convergence rate if the strong
Minty condition is satisfied.

supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the final coalescence phase. It is
probably the first SMBHB coalescence event observable in human history. Radio
observations of J1430+2303 before and after coalescence will provide a unique
diagnosis of the energetics and environment of the SMBHB.
  Aims. We explore the radio emission from the galactic nucleus region that is
closely related to the current X-ray and optical activities and helps to
understand the state of black hole accretion and outflow before coalescence.
  Methods. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging is the only method
that offers milli-arcsecond-level high resolution that can exclude the
contamination by diffuse emission on galactic scales. We observed J1430+2303
with the European VLBI Network at 1.7 GHz and with the Very Long Baseline Array
at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz in late February and early March 2022.
  Results. A compact component is detected in all three VLBI images. It has a
brightness temperature of > 10^8 K, an unresolved morphology with a size < 0.8
pc, and a flat radio spectrum. These observational features are inconsistent
with large opening-angle outflows or winds, but indicate that this compact
component might be a jet or a corona. Nearly 60% of the emission is resolved by
VLBI and may come from remnant lobes of previous radio activities, the outer
layers of a structured jet, or shocks formed by the disc winds in the narrow
line region.
  Conclusions. Current VLBI images do not yet show signs of radio outbursts.
Our observations provide pre-coalescence radio data that are an important
reference for future comparative studies with the post-merger. In particular,
further resolving the jet will pave the way for probing the dynamical features
associated with inspiralling binary black holes.

alpharesolvable designs are obtained using matrix approaches which belong to
the above classes. In every construction we obtain a matrix N whose blocks are
square (0,1) matrices such that N becomes the incidence matrix of a rectangular
design. The method is the reverse of the well known tactical decomposition of
the incidence matrix of a known design. Authors have already obtained some
series of Group Divisible and Latin square designs using this method. Tactical
decomposable designs are of great interest because of their connections with
automorphisms of designs, see Bekar et al. (1982). The rectangular designs
constructed here are of statistical as well as combinatorial interest.

occupancy predictions. Compared to the current SOTA, our approach predicts
occupancy for a longer horizon of 3 seconds and in a relatively complex

the transient dynamics of microgrids in the presence of disturbances. As a
scalable data-driven approach, M-KBF divides the identification and prediction
of the high-dimensional nonlinear system into the individual study of
subsystems; and thus, alleviating the difficulty of intensively handling high
volume data and overcoming the curse of dimensionality. For each subsystem,
Koopman bilinear form is applied to efficiently identify its model by
developing eigenfunctions via the extended dynamic mode decomposition method
with an eigenvalue-based order truncation. Extensive tests show that M-KBF can
provide accurate transient dynamics prediction for the nonlinear microgrids and
verify the plug-and-play modeling and prediction function, which offers a
potent tool for identifying high-dimensional systems. The modularity feature of
M-KBF enables the provision of fast and precise prediction for the microgrid

process. The power-law density exponent describes the steepness of density
profiles, and it has been used to characterize the density structures of the
clouds yet its usage is usually limited to spherically symmetric systems.
Importing the Level-Set Method, we develop a new formalism that generates
robust maps of a generalized density exponent $k_{\rho}$ at every location for
complex density distributions. By applying it to high fidelity, high dynamical
range map of the Perseus molecular cloud constructed using data from the
Herschel and Planck satellites, we find that the density exponent exhibits a
surprisingly wide range of variation ($-3.5 \lesssim k_{\rho} \lesssim -0.5$).
Regions at later stages of gravitational collapse are associated with steeper
density profiles. Inside a region, gas located in the vicinities of dense
structures has very steep density profiles with $k_{\rho} \approx -3$, which
forms because of depletion. This density exponent analysis reveals diverse
density structures, forming a coherent picture that gravitational collapse
leads to a continued steepening of the density profile. We expect our method to
be effective in studying other power-law-like density structures, including
granular materials and the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe.

until the source passed behind the Sun at the start of November, 86 days later.
Observations then restarted on day 197, once RS Oph emerged from the Sun

nova ejecta and red giant wind are similar following the last two eruptions. In
contrast, the early super-soft source (SSS) in 2021 was both less variable and
significantly fainter than in 2006. However, 0.3-1 keV light-curves from 2021
reveal a 35 s quasi-periodic oscillation consistent in frequency with the 2006
data. The Swift X-ray spectra from 2021 are featureless, with the soft emission
typically being well parametrized by a simple blackbody, while the 2006 spectra
showed much stronger evidence for superimposed ionized absorption edges.
Considering the data after day 60 following each eruption, during the supersoft
phase the 2021 spectra are hotter, with smaller effective radii and lower wind
absorption, leading to an apparently reduced bolometric luminosity. We explore
possible explanations for the gross differences in observed SSS behaviour

effects, where interloper galaxies along the line-of-sight to a cluster are
mistaken as genuine members of the cluster. In the previous study (Sunayama et
al. 2020), we found that the projection effects cause the boost on the
amplitudes of clustering and lensing on large scale compared to the expected
amplitudes in the absence of any projection effects. These boosts are caused by
preferential selections of filamentary structure aligned to the line-of-sight
due to distance uncertainties in photometric surveys. We model the projection
effects with two simple assumptions and develop a novel method to quantify the
size of the boost using cluster-galaxy cross-correlation functions. We validate
our method using mock cluster catalogs built from cosmological N-body
simulations and find that we can obtain unbiased constraints on the boost
parameter with our model. We then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer
clusters and find that the size of the boost is roughly 20% for all the
richness bins except the cluster sample with the richness bin $\lambda \in

learning (RL) for controlling MDPs, deterministic Rabin automata were used in

to repair them by using good-for-MDPs (GFM) B\""uchi automata instead. These are
nondeterministic B\""uchi automata with a restricted type of nondeterminism,
albeit not as restricted as in good-for-games automata. Indeed, deterministic
Rabin automata have a pretty straightforward translation to such GFM automata,
which is bi-linear in the number of states and pairs. Interestingly, the same
cannot be said for deterministic Streett automata: a translation to
nondeterministic Rabin or B\""uchi automata comes at an exponential cost, even
without requiring the target automaton to be good-for-MDPs. Do we have to pay
more than that to obtain a good-for-MDP automaton? The surprising answer is
that we have to pay significantly less when we instead expand the good-for-MDP
property to alternating automata: like the nondeterministic GFM automata
obtained from deterministic Rabin automata, the alternating good-for-MDP

development in the general theoretical framework for studying symmetry in
dynamics. This development, called resource theory of asymmetry, is expected to
have a wide range of applications, from accurate time measurements to black
hole physics. Despite its importance, the foundation of resource theory of
asymmetry still has room for expansion. An important problem is in quantifying
the amount of resource. When the symmetry prescribed U(1), i.e., with a single
conserved quantity, the quantum Fisher information is known as a resource
measure that has suitable properties and a clear physical meaning related to
quantum fluctuation of the conserved quantity. However, it is not clear what is
the resource measure with such suitable properties when a general symmetry
prevails for which there are multiple conserved quantities. The purpose of this
paper is to fill this gap. Specifically, we show that the quantum Fisher
information matrix is a resource measure whenever a connected linear Lie group
describes the symmetry. We also consider the physical meaning of this matrix
and see which properties that the quantum Fisher information has when the
symmetry is described by $U(1)$ can be inherited by the quantum Fisher
information matrix.

mixture models, where we observe the output of a randomly selected model, here
the observed model depends on the outputs themselves, and is determined by some
known selection criterion. For example, we might observe the highest output,
the smallest output, or the median output of the $k$ models. In known-index
self-selection, the identity of the observed model output is observable; in
unknown-index self-selection, it is not. Self-selection has a long history in
Econometrics and applications in various theoretical and applied fields,

We derive explicitly the Coulomb drag current in terms of the solid's

liquid-graphene interface. Furthermore, we show that the current generation

Both produce draws that can be used to compute consistent estimates, confidence

cell cultures is cost- and time-consuming and often performed rather
empirically. Efficient optimization of multiple-objectives like process time,
viable cell density, number of operating steps & cultivation scales, required
medium, amount of product as well as product quality depicts a promising
approach. This contribution presents a workflow which couples uncertainty-based
upstream simulation and Bayes optimization using Gaussian processes. Its
application is demonstrated in a simulation case study for a relevant
industrial task in process development, the design of a robust cell culture
expansion process (seed train), meaning that despite uncertainties and
variabilities concerning cell growth, low variations of viable cell density
during the seed train are obtained. Compared to a non-optimized reference seed
train, the optimized process showed much lower deviation rates regarding viable
cell densities (<~10% instead of 41.7%) using 5 or 4 shake flask scales and
seed train duration could be reduced by 56 h from 576 h to 520 h. Overall, it
is shown that applying Bayes optimization allows for optimization of a
multi-objective optimization function with several optimizable input variables
and under a considerable amount of constraints with a low computational effort.
This approach provides the potential to be used in form of a decision tool,

event-driven and timing-aware programs. Traditionally, such programs are
written in low-level machine-oriented programming languages like C or Assembly.
We present an alternative by introducing Synchron, an API that offers
high-level abstractions to the programmer while supporting the low-level
infrastructure in an associated runtime system and one-time-effort drivers.
Embedded systems applications exhibit the general characteristics of being (i)
concurrent, (ii) I/O-bound and (iii) timing-aware. To address each of these
concerns, the Synchron API consists of three components: (1) a Concurrent ML
(CML) inspired message-passing concurrency model, (2) a message-passing--based
I/O interface that translates between low-level interrupt based and
memory-mapped peripherals, and (3) a timing operator, $syncT$, that marries
CML's $sync$ operator with timing windows inspired from the TinyTimber kernel.
We implement the Synchron API as the bytecode instructions of a virtual machine
called SynchronVM. SynchronVM hosts a Caml-inspired functional language as its
frontend language, and the backend of the VM supports the STM32F4 and NRF52
microcontrollers, with RAM in the order of hundreds of kilobytes. We illustrate
the expressiveness of the Synchron API by showing examples of expressing state
machines commonly found in embedded systems. The timing functionality is
demonstrated through a music programming exercise. Finally, we provide
benchmarks on the response time, jitter rates, memory, and power usage of the
SynchronVM.

Millimeter-Wave ( mmWave) devices is the time-frequency analysis of the
small-scale Doppler effect (termed micro-Doppler) of the different body parts,
which requires a regularly spaced and dense sampling of the Channel Impulse
Response ( CIR). This is currently done in the literature either using
special-purpose radar sensors, or interrupting communications to transmit
dedicated sensing waveforms, entailing high overhead and channel utilization.
In this work we present SPARCS, an integrated human sensing and communication
solution for mmWave systems. SPARCS is the first method that reconstructs high
quality signatures of human movement from irregular and sparse CIR samples,
such as the ones obtained during communication traffic patterns. To accomplish
this, we formulate the micro-Doppler extraction as a sparse recovery problem,
which is critical to enable a smooth integration between communication and
sensing. Moreover, if needed, our system can seamlessly inject short CIR
estimation fields into the channel whenever communication traffic is absent or
insufficient for the micro-Doppler extraction. SPARCS effectively leverages the
intrinsic sparsity of the mmWave channel, thus drastically reducing the sensing
overhead with respect to available approaches. We implemented SPARCS on an IEEE
802.11ay Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform working in the 60 GHz band,
collecting standard-compliant CIR traces matching the traffic patterns of real
WiFi access points. Our results show that the micro-Doppler signatures obtained
by SPARCS enable a typical downstream application such as human activity
recognition with more than 7 times lower overhead with respect to existing
methods, while achieving better recognition performance.

of the cloud into small gas-rich subclusters, which can then subsequently

simulate collisions between these subclusters, using coupled smooth particle
hydrodynamics for the gas and N-body dynamics for the stars. We are guided by
previous radiation hydrodynamics simulations of molecular cloud collapse which
provide the global properties of the colliding clusters, such as their stellar
and gas masses, and their initial positions and velocities. The subclusters in
the original simulation were treated as sink particles which immediately merged
into a single entity after the collision. We show that the more detailed
treatment provides a more complex picture. At collisional velocities above ~ 10
km/s, the stellar components of the cluster do not form a monolithic cluster
within 3 Myr, although the gas may do so. At lower velocities, the clusters do
eventually merge but over timescales that may be longer than the time for a
subsequent collision. The structure of the resultant cluster is not well-fit by
any standard density distribution, and the clusters are not in equilibrium but
continue to expand over our simulation time. We conclude that the simple sink
particle treatment of subcluster mergers in large-scale giant molecular cloud
simulations provides an upper limit on the final cluster properties.

receiver arrays is constructed. In this paper, we propose two strategies to
address the extremely high complexity caused by eigenvalue decomposition of the
received signal covariance matrix. Firstly, a rapid power-iterative rotational
invariance (RPI-RI) method is proposed, which adopts the signal subspace
generated by power iteration to gets the final direction estimation through
rotational invariance between subarrays. RPI-RI makes a significant complexity
reduction at the cost of a substantial performance loss. In order to further
reduce the complexity and provide a good directional measurement result, a
rapid power-iterative Polynomial rooting (RPI-PR) method is proposed, which
utilizes the noise subspace combined with polynomial solution method to get the
optimal direction estimation. In addition, the influence of initial vector
selection on convergence in the power iteration is analyzed, especially when
the initial vector is orthogonal to the incident wave. Simulation results show
that the two proposed methods outperform the conventional DOA estimation
methods in terms of computational complexity. In particular, the RPIPR method
achieves more than two orders of magnitude lower complexity than conventional
methods and achieves performance close to CRLB. Moreover, it is verified that
the initial vector and the relative error have a significant impact on the
performance of the computational complexity.

  Uncertainty Estimation","5 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  mmWave radars have recently gathered significant attention as a means to
track human movement within indoor environments. Widely adopted Kalman filter
tracking methods experience performance degradation when the underlying
movement is highly non-linear or presents long-term temporal dependencies. As a
solution, in this article we design a convolutional-recurrent Neural Network
(NN) that learns to accurately estimate the position and the velocity of the
monitored subjects from high dimensional radar data. The NN is trained as a
probabilistic model, utilizing a Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss
function, obtaining explicit uncertainty estimates at its output, in the form
of time-varying error covariance matrices. A thorough experimental assessment
is conducted using a 77 GHz FMCW radar. The proposed architecture, besides
allowing one to gauge the uncertainty in the tracking process, also leads to
greatly improved performance against the best approaches from the literature,
i.e., Kalman filtering, lowering the average error against the ground truth
from 32.8 to 7.59 cm and from 56.8 to 14 cm/s in terms of position and velocity
tracking, respectively.

  Systems",,"2022 TRO",,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurate and reliable sensor calibration is essential to fuse LiDAR and
inertial measurements, which are usually available in robotic applications. In
this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-IMU calibration method within the
continuous-time batch-optimization framework, where the intrinsics of both
sensors and the spatial-temporal extrinsics between sensors are calibrated
without using calibration infrastructure such as fiducial tags. Compared to
discrete-time approaches, the continuous-time formulation has natural
advantages for fusing high rate measurements from LiDAR and IMU sensors. To
improve efficiency and address degenerate motions, two observability-aware
modules are leveraged: (i) The information-theoretic data selection policy
selects only the most informative segments for calibration during data
collection, which significantly improves the calibration efficiency by
processing only the selected informative segments. (ii) The observability-aware
state update mechanism in nonlinear least-squares optimization updates only the
identifiable directions in the state space with truncated singular value
decomposition (TSVD), which enables accurate calibration results even under
degenerate cases where informative data segments are not available. The
proposed LiDAR-IMU calibration approach has been validated extensively in both
simulated and real-world experiments with different robot platforms,
demonstrating its high accuracy and repeatability in commonly-seen human-made

  redMaPPer clusters","21 pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The clustering of dark matter halos depends on the assembly history of halos
at fixed halo mass; a phenomenon referred to as \textit{halo assembly bias}.
Halo assembly bias is readily observed in cosmological simulations of dark
matter. However, it is difficult to detect it in observations. The
identification of galaxy or cluster properties correlated with the formation
time of the halo at fixed halo mass and the ability to select galaxy clusters
free from projection effects are the two most significant hurdles in the
observational detection of halo assembly bias. The latter, in particular, can
cause a misleading detection of halo assembly bias by boosting the amplitude of
lensing and clustering on large scales. This study uses twelve different
properties of central galaxies of SDSS redMaPPer clusters derived from
spectroscopy to divide the clusters into sub-samples. We test the dependence of
the clustering amplitude on these properties at fixed richness. We first infer
halo mass and bias using weak lensing signals around the clusters using shapes
of galaxies from the SDSS survey. We validate the bias difference between the
two subsamples using cluster-galaxy cross-correlations. This methodology allows
us to decouple the contamination due to the projection effects from the halo
assembly bias signals. We do not find any significant evidence of a difference
in the clustering amplitudes correlated with any of our explored properties.
Our results indicate that central galaxy properties may not correlate
significantly with the halo assembly histories at fixed richness.

chemical potential is balanced between sites, in a region where a macrodroplet
is extended over several lattice sites. Further, we observe a transition to a

interactions$-$marked by the disappearance of the interference pattern in the

one-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii theory, including quantum

(radiatively-pumped) have been studied in great detail in our Galaxy in a
variety of astrophysical environments such as shocks and star-forming regions
and are helpful to analyze the properties of the dense interstellar medium.
However, the study of methanol masers in external galaxies is still in its
infancy. Aims: Our main goal is to search for methanol masers in the central
molecular zone (CMZ; inner 500 pc) of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253.
Methods: Covering a frequency range between 84 and 373 GHz ($\lambda$ = 3.6 to
0.8 mm) at high angular (1.6""$\sim$27 pc) and spectral ($\sim$8--9 km s$^{-1}$)
resolution with the ALMA large program ALCHEMI, we have probed different
regions across the CMZ of NGC 253. In order to look for methanol maser
candidates, we employed the rotation diagram method and a set of radiative
transfer models. Results: We detect for the first time masers above 84 GHz in
NGC 253, covering an ample portion of the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$
line series (at 84, 132, 229, and 278 GHz) and the $J_{0}\rightarrow(J-$
1)$_{1}-A$ series (at 95, 146, and 198 GHz). This confirms the presence of the
Class I maser line at 84 GHz, already reported but now being detected in more
than one location. For the $J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series, we
observe a lack of Class I maser candidates in the central star-forming disk.
Conclusions: The physical conditions for maser excitation in the
$J_{-1}\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series can be weak shocks and
cloud-cloud collisions as suggested by shock tracers (SiO and HNCO) in
bi-symmetric shock/active regions located in the outskirts of the CMZ. On the
other hand, the presence of photodissociation regions due to a high
star-formation rate would be needed to explain the lack of Class I masers in
the very central regions.

We furthermore seek particular configurations of the environments in which the

applied to a sample of well-studied photodissociation regions (PDRs) with
well-determined physical conditions (the radiation field strength, $G_{0}$,
electron density $n_{e}$, and the gas temperature, $T_{\rm gas}$).
Specifically, we modelled the emission of five PAHs ranging in size from 18 to
96 carbon atoms, over a range of physical conditions characterized by the
ionization parameter $\gamma = G_{0}\times T_{\rm gas}^{1/2}/n_{e}$. The anions
emerge as the dominant charge carriers in low $\gamma $ ($< 2\times 10^{2}$)
environments, neutrals in the intermediate $\gamma$ ($10^{3} - 10^{4}$)
environments, and cations in the high $\gamma$ ($ > 10^{5}$) environments.
Furthermore, the PAH anions and cations exhibit similar spectral
characteristics. The similarity in the cationic and anionic spectra translates
into the interpretation of the 6.2/(11.0+11.2) band ratio, with high values of
this ratio associated with large contributions from either cations or anions.
The model's predicted values of 6.2/(11.0+11.2) and 3.3/6.2 compared well to
the observations in the PDRs NGC 7023, NGC 2023, the horsehead nebula, the

can account for the variations in the observed PAH emission. We also reassess
the diagnostic potential of the 6.2/(11.0+11.2) vs 3.3/(11.0+11.2) ratios and
show that without any prior knowledge about $\gamma$, the 3.3/(11.0+11.2) can
predict the PAH size, but the 6.2/(11.0+11.2) cannot predict the $\gamma$ of
the astrophysical environment.

Unfortunately, while the full phase space of simulated regions is available,

from 2D data alone are reliable and representative of clusters real parameters
and the impact of line-of-sight orientation. In this paper we derive parameters
for a simulated cluster formed from a cloud-cloud collision with the full 6D
phase space, and compare them with those derived from three different 2D
line-of-sight orientations for the cluster. We show the same qualitative
conclusions can be reached when viewing clusters in 2D versus 3D, but that
drawing quantitative conclusions when viewing in 2D is likely to be inaccurate.
The greatest divergence occurs in the perceived kinematics of the cluster,
which in some orientations appears to be expanding when the cluster is actually
contracting. Increases in the cluster density compounds pre-existing
perspective issues, reducing the relative accuracy and consistency of
properties derived from different orientations. This is particularly
problematic for determination of the number, and membership, of subclusters
present in the cluster. We find the fraction of subclusters correctly
identified in 2D decreases as the cluster evolves, reaching less than 3.4% at
the evolutionary end point for our cluster.

continuously learning with the new incoming domain data in real-world scenarios

when handling multiple domains: (1) the models will achieve limited performance
(even drop dramatically) among old domains after training images from new
domains due to the discrepancies of intrinsic data distributions from various
domains, which is called catastrophic forgetting; (2) the well-trained model in
a specific domain achieves imperfect performance among other unseen domains
because of the domain shift; and (3) it leads to linearly increasing storage
overhead, either mixing all the data for training or simply training dozens of
separate models for different domains when new ones are available. To overcome
these issues, we investigated a new crowd counting task in the incremental
domains training setting called Lifelong Crowd Counting. Its goal is to
alleviate the catastrophic forgetting and improve the generalization ability
using a single model updated by the incremental domains. Specifically, we
propose a self-distillation learning framework as a benchmark (Forget Less,
Count Better, or FLCB) for lifelong crowd counting, which helps the model
sustainably leverage previous meaningful knowledge for better crowd counting to
mitigate the forgetting when the new data arrive. In addition, a new
quantitative metric, normalized backward transfer (nBwT), is developed to
evaluate the forgetting degree of the model in the lifelong learning process.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
benchmark in achieving a low catastrophic forgetting degree and strong
generalization ability.

fundamental paradigm in quantum physics. The nonlinearity provided by the atom
means that the light-matter interaction depends strongly on the number of
photons interacting with the two-level system within its emission lifetime.
This nonlinearity results in the unveiling of strongly correlated
quasi-particles known as photon bound states, giving rise to key physical
processes such as stimulated emission and soliton propagation. While signatures
consistent with the existence of photon bound states have been measured in
strongly interacting Rydberg gases, their hallmark excitation-number-dependent
dispersion and propagation velocity have not yet been observed. Here, we report
the direct observation of a photon-number-dependent time delay in the
scattering off a single semiconductor quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity.
By scattering a weak coherent pulse off the cavity-QED system and measuring the
time-dependent output power and correlation functions, we show that single
photons, and two- and three-photon bound states incur different time delays of
144.02\,ps, 66.45\,ps and 45.51\,ps respectively. The reduced time delay of the
two-photon bound state is a fingerprint of the celebrated example of stimulated
emission, where the arrival of two photons within the lifetime of an emitter
causes one photon to stimulate the emission of the other from the atom.

models to analyze critical infrastructure system resilience. For realistic
applications, these ML models consider the component-level characteristics that
influence the network response during emergencies. However, such an approach
could result in a large number of features and cause ML models to suffer from
the `curse of dimensionality'. We present a clustering-based method that
simultaneously minimizes the problem of high-dimensionality and improves the
prediction accuracy of ML models developed for resilience analysis in
large-scale interdependent infrastructure networks. The methodology has three
parts: (a) generation of simulation dataset, (b) network component clustering,
and (c) dimensionality reduction and development of prediction models. First,
an interdependent infrastructure simulation model simulates the network-wide
consequences of various disruptive events. The component-level features are
extracted from the simulated data. Next, clustering algorithms are used to
derive the cluster-level features by grouping component-level features based on
their topological and functional characteristics. Finally, ML algorithms are
used to develop models that predict the network-wide impacts of disruptive
events using the cluster-level features. The applicability of the method is
demonstrated using an interdependent power-water-transport testbed. The
proposed method can be used to develop decision-support tools for post-disaster
recovery of infrastructure networks.

indicates a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that may be produced by outbursts
from the progenitor star. Wave-driven mass loss is a possible mechanism to
produce these signatures, with previous work suggesting this mechanism is most
effective for low mass ($ \sim \! 11 \, M_\odot$) SN progenitors. Using
one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with MESA, we study the effects of
this wave heating in SN progenitors of masses $M_{\rm ZAMS} = 10-13\,
M_{\odot}$. This range encompasses stars that experience semi-degenerate,
central neon burning and more degenerate, off-center neon ignition. We find
that central Ne ignition at $M_{\rm ZAMS} = 11\, M_{\odot}$ produces a burst of
intense wave heating that transmits $\sim10^{47}$ erg of energy at $10$ years
before core collapse, whereas other masses experience smaller levels of wave
heating. Wave heating does not hydrodynamically drive mass loss in any of our
models and is unlikely to produce a very massive CSM on its own. However, wave
heating can cause large radial expansion (by more than an order of magnitude),
photospheric cooling, and luminosity brightening by up to $\sim 10^6\,
L_{\odot}$ in hydrogen-poor stripped star models. Some type Ib/c progenitors
could drastically change their appearance in the final years of their lives,
with brightness in visual bands increasing by nearly 3 mags. Moreover,
interaction with a close binary companion could drive intense mass loss, with
implications for type Ibn and other interaction-powered SNe.

performance (compared to non-learning methods) and important scalability
(compared to existing learning architectures) for the stated class of MRTA

Mechanism or CapAM acts as the policy network, and includes three main
components: 1) an encoder: a Capsule Network based node embedding model to
represent each task as a learnable feature vector; 2) a decoder: an
attention-based model to facilitate a sequential output; and 3) context: that
encodes the states of the mission and the robots. To train the CapAM model, the
policy-gradient method based on REINFORCE is used. When evaluated over unseen
scenarios, CapAM demonstrates better task completion performance and $>$10
times faster decision-making compared to standard non-learning based online
MRTA methods. CapAM's advantage in generalizability, and scalability to test
problems of size larger than those used in training, are also successfully

problem through weakly-supervised semantic segmentation models using
image-level labels as supervision since it can significantly reduce human
annotation efforts. Most of the advanced solutions exploit class activation
mapping (CAM). However, the original CAMs rarely capture the precise boundaries

potential of CAR-T cell therapy for blood diseases, reliable cell morphological
identification is crucial. Nevertheless, the identification of CAR-T cells is a
big challenge posed by their phenotypic similarity with other blood cells. To
address this substantial clinical challenge, herein we first construct a CAR-T

create a novel integrated model called RCMNet (ResNet18 with CBAM and MHSA)

is decisive for the dissipation of energy in condensed matter we performed
time-resolved broadband femtosecond transient reflectivity measurements on
$7-197 \mathrm{nm}$ thick Bi(111) films epitaxially grown on Si(111). We
monitored the behavior of the Fourier amplitude and the central frequency of
the coherent $A_\mathrm{1g}$ phonon mode as function of the incident fluence,
film thickness, and probe wavelength in the range of $580 -700 \mathrm{nm}$.
The frequency redshift that follows photoexcitation was used as a robust
quantity to determine the effective distribution of excited carriers that
governs the displacive excitation mechanism of coherent $A_\mathrm{1g}$ phonons
in Bi. For Bi films up to $50 \mathrm{nm}$ thickness a homogeneous excitation
due to the ultrafast transport of hot charge carriers is observed, limited by a
carrier penetration depth of $60 \mathrm{nm}$ independent of the totally
deposited laser energy.

an interdisciplinary understanding of the possibilities and limits of hegemonic
computational approaches to ML fairness for producing just outcomes for
society's most marginalized. The article is organized according to nine major
themes of critique wherein these different fields intersect: 1) how ""fairness""
in AI fairness research gets defined; 2) how problems for AI systems to address
get formulated; 3) the impacts of abstraction on how AI tools function and its
propensity to lead to technological solutionism; 4) how racial classification
operates within AI fairness research; 5) the use of AI fairness measures to
avoid regulation and engage in ethics washing; 6) an absence of participatory
design and democratic deliberation in AI fairness considerations; 7) data
collection practices that entrench ""bias,"" are non-consensual, and lack
transparency; 8) the predatory inclusion of marginalized groups into AI
systems; and 9) a lack of engagement with AI's long-term social and ethical
outcomes. Drawing from these critiques, the article concludes by imagining
future ML fairness research directions that actively disrupt entrenched power
dynamics and structural injustices in society.

shift away from car-centric city planning. For this, traffic planners often
rely on simulation tools such as SUMO which allow them to study the effects of

road users, here cyclists, also use such models to assess the performance of
communication-based road traffic safety systems. The cyclist model in SUMO,
however, is very imprecise as SUMO cyclists behave either like slow cars or
fast pedestrians, thus, casting doubt on simulation results for bicycle

We use the results to derive an improved cyclist model and implement it in

low-income neighbourhoods to alleviate socio-spatial inequalities and increase
quality of life. However, transportation planners often overlook transit
investments in neighbourhoods with ""transit-captive"" populations because they
are assumed to result in less mode-shifting, congestion relief, and
environmental benefits, compared to investments that aim to attract choice
riders in wealthier communities. In North American cities, while many
low-income households are already transit users, some also own and use private
vehicles. It suggests that transit improvements in low-income communities could
indeed result in more transit use and less car use. Accordingly, the main
objective of this article is to explore the statistical relationship between
transit use and transit accessibility as well as how this varies by household
income and vehicle ownership in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA).
Using stratified regression models, we find that low-income households with one
or more cars per adult have the most elastic relationship between transit
accessibility and transit use; they are more likely to be transit riders if
transit improves. However, we confirm that in auto-centric areas with poor
transit, the transit use of low-income households drops off sharply as car
ownership increases. On the other hand, a sensitivity analysis suggests more
opportunities for increasing transit ridership among car-deficit households
when transit is improved. These findings indicate that improving transit in
low-income inner suburbs, where most low-income car-owning households are
living, would align social with environmental planning goals.

simultaneous absolute measurements of several flow parameters with low

optical frequency output of the lasers. We perform DCS measurements across a
6800-7200 cm-1 bandwidth covering hundreds of H2O absorption features resolved
with a spectral point spacing of 0.0067 cm-1 and point spacing precision of
1.68 x 10-10 cm-1. We demonstrate 2D profiles of velocity, temperature,

beams offer sufficient spatial resolution to resolve properties across an
oblique shock train in the isolator and the thermal throat of the combustor. We
determine that the total measurement uncertainties for the various parameters
range from 1% for temperature to 9% for water vapor mole fraction, with the

contributing the most uncertainty (leaving the door open for even lower
uncertainty in the future). CFD at the various measurement locations show good
agreement, largely falling within the DCS measurement uncertainty for most

growing challenge in modern supervised learning scenarios. This incentivizes
developing domain adaptation methods that leverage the knowledge in known
domains (source) and adapt to new domains (target) with a different probability
distribution. This becomes more challenging when the source and target domains
are in heterogeneous feature spaces, known as heterogeneous domain adaptation
(HDA). While most HDA methods utilize mathematical optimization to map source
and target data to a common space, they suffer from low transferability. Neural
representations have proven to be more transferable; however, they are mainly
designed for homogeneous environments. Drawing on the theory of domain
adaptation, we propose a novel framework, Heterogeneous Adversarial Neural
Domain Adaptation (HANDA), to effectively maximize the transferability in
heterogeneous environments. HANDA conducts feature and distribution alignment
in a unified neural network architecture and achieves domain invariance through
adversarial kernel learning. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the
performance against the state-of-the-art HDA methods on major image and text
e-commerce benchmarks. HANDA shows statistically significant improvement in
predictive performance. The practical utility of HANDA was shown in real-world
dark web online markets. HANDA is an important step towards successful domain

functional and structural interactions and connections among brain regions, and
factors that affect them, such as brain development and disease. Graph mining
on brain networks may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for clinical
phenotypes and neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain networks derived from
functional and structural MRI describe the brain topology from different
perspectives, exploring a representation that combines these cross-modality
brain networks is non-trivial. Most current studies aim to extract a fused
representation of the two types of brain network by projecting the structural
network to the functional counterpart. Since the functional network is dynamic
and the structural network is static, mapping a static object to a dynamic
object is suboptimal. However, mapping in the opposite direction is not
feasible due to the non-negativity requirement of current graph learning
techniques. Here, we propose a novel graph learning framework, known as Deep
Signed Brain Networks (DSBN), with a signed graph encoder that, from an
opposite perspective, learns the cross-modality representations by projecting
the functional network to the structural counterpart. We validate our framework
on clinical phenotype and neurodegenerative disease prediction tasks using two
independent, publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental
results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several

gradient descent algorithm executed on a communication-based network. For
convenience, we refer to it as a network gradient descent (NGD) method. In the
NGD method, only statistics (e.g., parameter estimates) need to be
communicated, minimizing the risk of privacy. Meanwhile, different clients
communicate with each other directly according to a carefully designed network
structure without a central master. This greatly enhances the reliability of
the entire algorithm. Those nice properties inspire us to carefully study the
NGD method both theoretically and numerically. Theoretically, we start with a
classical linear regression model. We find that both the learning rate and the
network structure play significant roles in determining the NGD estimator's
statistical efficiency. The resulting NGD estimator can be statistically as
efficient as the global estimator, if the learning rate is sufficiently small
and the network structure is well balanced, even if the data are distributed
heterogeneously. Those interesting findings are then extended to general models
and loss functions. Extensive numerical studies are presented to corroborate
our theoretical findings. Classical deep learning models are also presented for
