competing electronic and magnetic order are of strong interest for studying
fundamental interactions and excitations, such as Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids
and topological orders and defects with properties completely different from
the quasiparticles expected in their higher-dimensional counterparts. However,
clean 1D electronic systems are difficult to realize experimentally,
particularly magnetically ordered systems. Here, we show that the van der Waals
layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr behaves like a quasi-1D material embedded
in a magnetically ordered environment. The strong 1D electronic character
originates from the Cr-S chains and the combination of weak interlayer
hybridization and anisotropy in effective mass and dielectric screening with an
effective electron mass ratio of $m^e_X/m^e_Y \sim 50$. This extreme anisotropy
experimentally manifests in strong electron-phonon and exciton-phonon
interactions, a Peierls-like structural instability and a Fano resonance from a
van Hove singularity of similar strength of metallic carbon nanotubes.
Moreover, due to the reduced dimensionality and interlayer coupling, CrSBr
hosts spectrally narrow (1 meV) excitons of high binding energy and oscillator
strength that inherit the 1D character. Overall, CrSBr is best understood as a
stack of weakly hybridized monolayers and appears to be an experimentally
attractive candidate for the study of exotic exciton and 1D correlated
many-body physics in the presence of magnetic order.

propose a taxonomy of issues that highlights significant gaps in TSG quality.
To alleviate these gaps, we investigate the automation of TSGs and propose
AutoTSG -- a novel framework for automation of TSGs to executable workflows by
combining machine learning and program synthesis. Our evaluation of AutoTSG on
50 TSGs shows the effectiveness in both identifying TSG statements (accuracy

field $T$ in a curved Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe both in the presence

show that the tachyon field exhibits a non-trivial dynamics. In a flat

of interaction. This implies $\omega_D=-1$ for the equation-of-state parameter,
which in turn can be used for modeling the cosmological constant behavior. On
the other hand, for a non-flat Universe and various values of Barrow parameter,
we find that $\dot T^2$ decreases monotonically for increasing $\cos(R_h/a)$

Sign-Magnetic Laplacian ($L^{\sigma}$), a new Laplacian matrix that we
introduce ex novo in this work. $L^{\sigma}$ allows us to bridge a gap in the
current literature by extending the theory of spectral GCNs to (directed)

by the weight magnitude. $L^{\sigma}$ is also completely parameter-free, which
is not the case of other Laplacian operators such as, e.g., the Magnetic

  ""Persuading with Anecdotes"" as an NBER working paper",,,,"econ.TH cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study a communication game between a sender and receiver where the sender
has access to a set of informative signals about a state of the world. The
sender chooses one of her signals, called an ``anecdote'' and communicates it
to the receiver. The receiver takes an action, yielding a utility for both
players. Sender and receiver both care about the state of the world but are
also influenced by a personal preference so that their ideal actions differ. We
characterize perfect Bayesian equilibria when the sender cannot commit to a
particular communication scheme. In this setting the sender faces ``persuasion
temptation'': she is tempted to select a more biased anecdote to influence the
receiver's action. Anecdotes are still informative to the receiver but
persuasion comes at the cost of precision. This gives rise to ``informational
homophily'' where the receiver prefers to listen to like-minded senders because
they provide higher-precision signals. In particular, we show that a sender
with access to many anecdotes will essentially send the minimum or maximum
anecdote even though with high probability she has access to an anecdote close
to the state of the world that would almost perfectly reveal it to the
receiver. In contrast to the classic Crawford-Sobel model, full revelation is a
knife-edge equilibrium and even small differences in personal preferences will
induce highly polarized communication and a loss in utility for any
equilibrium. We show that for fat-tailed anecdote distributions the receiver
might even prefer to talk to poorly informed senders with aligned preferences
rather than a knowledgeable expert whose preferences may differ from her own.
We also show that under commitment differences in personal preferences no
longer affect communication and the sender will generally report the most
representative anecdote closest to the posterior mean for common distributions.

a scheme is currently constrained by slow and unstable convergence due to the

under-explored phenomena of biased local learning that may explain these
challenges caused by local updates in supervised FL. As a remedy, we propose
FedBR, a novel unified algorithm that reduces the local learning bias on
features and classifiers to tackle these challenges. FedBR has two components.
The first component helps to reduce bias in local classifiers by balancing the
output of the models. The second component helps to learn local features that
are similar to global features, but different from those learned from other
data sources. We conducted several experiments to test \algopt and found that
it consistently outperforms other SOTA FL methods. Both of its components also

large-scale multi-phase morphology. The ring configuration is motivated by the
observation that massive young star clusters are often distributed in a ring at
the host galaxy's inner Lindblad resonance, where larger-scale spiral arm
structure terminates. We present parameterized three-dimensional radiative
hydrodynamical simulations that follow the emergence and dynamics of
energy-driven hot winds from starburst rings. In this Letter, we show that the
flow shocks on itself within the inner ring hole, maintaining high $10^7$\,K
temperatures, whilst flows that emerge from the wind-driving ring unobstructed
can undergo rapid bulk cooling down to $10^4\,$K, producing a fast hot
bi-conical outflow enclosed by a sheath of cooler nearly co-moving material
without ram-pressure acceleration. The hot flow is collimated along the ring
axis, even in the absence of pressure confinement from a galactic disk or
magnetic fields. In the early stages of expansion, the emerging wind forms a
bubble-like shape reminiscent of the Milky Way's eROSITA and Fermi bubbles and
can reach velocities usually associated with AGN-driven winds. We discuss the
physics of the ring configuration, the conditions for radiative bulk cooling,

super-Poissonian fluctuations are clearly related to relaxation oscillations in

analysis in the domain of computer vision. However, video analysis has
considerably high computational costs with traditional artificial neural
networks (ANNs). Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are third generation
biologically plausible models that process the information in the form of
spikes. Unsupervised learning with SNNs using the spike timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) rule has the potential to overcome some bottlenecks of
regular artificial neural networks, but STDP-based SNNs are still immature and
their performance is far behind that of ANNs. In this work, we study the
performance of SNNs when challenged with the task of human action recognition,
because this task has many real-time applications in computer vision, such as
video surveillance. In this paper we introduce a multi-layered 3D convolutional
SNN model trained with unsupervised STDP. We compare the performance of this
model to those of a 2D STDP-based SNN when challenged with the KTH and Weizmann
datasets. We also compare single-layer and multi-layer versions of these models
in order to get an accurate assessment of their performance. We show that
STDP-based convolutional SNNs can learn motion patterns using 3D kernels, thus
enabling motion-based recognition from videos. Finally, we give evidence that
3D convolution is superior to 2D convolution with STDP-based SNNs, especially
when dealing with long video sequences.

  with Provable Sample Efficiency",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning in partially observed Markov decision processes
(POMDPs) faces two challenges. (i) It often takes the full history to predict
the future, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with
the horizon. (ii) The observation and state spaces are often continuous, which
induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the extrinsic
dimension. Addressing such challenges requires learning a minimal but
sufficient representation of the observation and state histories by exploiting
the structure of the POMDP.
  To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm named Embed to
Control (ETC), which learns the representation at two levels while optimizing
the policy.~(i) For each step, ETC learns to represent the state with a
low-dimensional feature, which factorizes the transition kernel. (ii) Across
multiple steps, ETC learns to represent the full history with a low-dimensional
embedding, which assembles the per-step feature. We integrate (i) and (ii) in a
unified framework that allows a variety of estimators (including maximum
likelihood estimators and generative adversarial networks). For a class of
POMDPs with a low-rank structure in the transition kernel, ETC attains an
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon
and the intrinsic dimension (that is, the rank). Here $\epsilon$ is the
optimality gap. To our best knowledge, ETC is the first sample-efficient
algorithm that bridges representation learning and policy optimization in
POMDPs with infinite observation and state spaces.

unmagnetized plasmas and enlarges the laser-plasma interaction (LPI) landscape.
In this paper, we use particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to investigate
strongly magnetized LPI in one dimension under conditions relevant for
magneto-inertial fusion experiments, focusing on a regime where the
electron-cyclotron frequency is greater than the plasma frequency and the
magnetic field is at an oblique angle with respect to the wave vectors. We show
that when electron-cyclotron-like hybrid wave frequency is about half the laser
frequency, the laser light resonantly decays to magnetized plasma waves via
primary and secondary instabilities with large growth rates. These distinct
magnetic-field-controlled instabilities, which we collectively call two-magnon
decays, are analogous to two-plasmon decays in unmagnetized plasmas. Since
additional phase mixing mechanisms are introduced by the oblique magnetic
field, collisionless damping of large-amplitude magnetized waves substantially
broadens the electron distribution function, especially along the direction of
the magnetic field. During this process, energy is transferred efficiently from
the laser to plasma waves and then to electrons, leading to a large overall
absorptivity when strong resonances are present. The enhanced laser energy
absorption may explain hotter-than-expected temperatures observed in magnetized
laser implosion experiments and may also be exploited to develop more efficient
laser-driven x-ray sources.

dynamic) graph is an effective representational framework that allows for
developing models for time series analysis. In fact, discrete sequences of
graphs can be processed by autoregressive graph neural networks to recursively
learn representations at each discrete point in time and space. Spatiotemporal
graphs are often highly sparse, with time series characterized by multiple,
concurrent, and long sequences of missing data, e.g., due to the unreliable
underlying sensor network. In this context, autoregressive models can be
brittle and exhibit unstable learning dynamics. The objective of this paper is,
then, to tackle the problem of learning effective models to reconstruct, i.e.,
impute, missing data points by conditioning the reconstruction only on the
available observations. In particular, we propose a novel class of
attention-based architectures that, given a set of highly sparse discrete
observations, learn a representation for points in time and space by exploiting
a spatiotemporal propagation architecture aligned with the imputation task.
Representations are trained end-to-end to reconstruct observations w.r.t. the
corresponding sensor and its neighboring nodes. Compared to the state of the
art, our model handles sparse data without propagating prediction errors or
requiring a bidirectional model to encode forward and backward time
dependencies. Empirical results on representative benchmarks show the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

unobserved? Modeling the unobserved neurons with large pools of hidden spiking
neurons leads to severely underconstrained problems that are hard to tackle
with maximum likelihood estimation. In this work, we use coarse-graining and
mean-field approximations to derive a bottom-up, neuronally-grounded latent
variable model (neuLVM), where the activity of the unobserved neurons is
reduced to a low-dimensional mesoscopic description. In contrast to previous
latent variable models, neuLVM can be explicitly mapped to a recurrent,
multi-population SNN, giving it a transparent biological interpretation. We
show, on synthetic spike trains, that a few observed neurons are sufficient for
neuLVM to perform efficient model inversion of large SNNs, in the sense that it
can recover connectivity parameters, infer single-trial latent population
activity, reproduce ongoing metastable dynamics, and generalize when subjected
to perturbations mimicking photo-stimulation.

contribution is a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimises a grid of

this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution
to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence.
However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in
an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and
using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some
ordering information, the nature of the \emph{permutation-invariant}
self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To
validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer
linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine
real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing
sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large
margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the
impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation
extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research
directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of

their enhancement via Feshbach resonances in ultracold systems has been limited

spectroscopically measure elastic p-wave interaction energies of strongly

observe elastic unitary p-wave interactions for the first time. We take the
first steps towards coherent temporal control via Rabi oscillations between
free-atom and interacting-pair states. All experimental observations are

  Journal",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The temperature structure of protoplanetary disks provides an important
constraint on where in the disks rocky planets like our own form. Recent
nonideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations have shown that the internal
Joule heating associated with magnetically driven disk accretion is inefficient
at heating the disk midplane. A disk temperature model based on the MHD
simulations predicts that in a disk around a solar-mass young star, the water
snow line can move inside the current Earth's orbit within 1 Myr after disk
formation. However, the efficiency of the internal Joule heating depends on the
disk's ionization and opacity structures, both of which are governed by dust
grains. In this study, we investigate these effects by combing the previous
temperature model for magnetically accreting disks with a parameterized model
for the grain size and vertical distribution. Grain growth enhances the gas
ionization fraction and thereby allows Joule heating to occur closer to the
midplane. However, growth beyond 10 $\rm \mu m$ causes a decrease in the disk
opacity, leading to a lower midplane temperature. The combination of these two
effects results in the midplane temperature being maximized when the grain size
is in the range 10-100 $\rm \mu m$. Grain growth to millimeter sizes can also
delay the snow line's migration to the 1 au orbit by up to a few Myr. We
conclude that accounting for dust growth is essential for accurately modeling
the snow line evolution and terrestrial planet formation in magnetically
accreting protoplanetary disks.

controlling the nuclear spin precession dynamics via an external magnetic field

behavior of the electron spin, showing a transition between classicality and
nonclassicality. We propose an explanation of the classicality-nonclassicality

hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to
discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach
consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group
Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate
the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches,
group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each
local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked
self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve
the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the
overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for
the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works
seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result,
MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and
efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin
Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\times$ faster and reduce the GPU
memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet
classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection
benchmarks. Code and pre-trained models have been made publicly available at

obtain a model, where zero isolation becomes equivalent to universal
coverability of orthant vector addition systems (OVAS), a new model in the VAS
family interesting on its own. In standard VAS runs are considered only in the
positive orthant, while in OVAS every orthant has its own set of vectors that
can be applied in that orthant. Assuming Schanuel's conjecture is true, we

models collaboratively without exposing their personal, potentially sensitive
data, making it a promising solution for data privacy in collaborative
training. The distributed nature of FL and unvetted data, however, makes it
inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks: In this scenario, an adversary
injects backdoor functionality into the centralized model during training,
which can be triggered to cause the desired misclassification for a specific
adversary-chosen input. A range of prior work establishes successful backdoor
injection in an FL system; however, these backdoors are not demonstrated to be
long-lasting. The backdoor functionality does not remain in the system if the
adversary is removed from the training process since the centralized model
parameters continuously mutate during successive FL training rounds. Therefore,
in this work, we propose PerDoor, a persistent-by-construction backdoor
injection technique for FL, driven by adversarial perturbation and targeting
parameters of the centralized model that deviate less in successive FL rounds
and contribute the least to the main task accuracy. An exhaustive evaluation
considering an image classification scenario portrays on average $10.5\times$
persistence over multiple FL rounds compared to traditional backdoor attacks.
Through experiments, we further exhibit the potency of PerDoor in the presence
of state-of-the-art backdoor prevention techniques in an FL system.
Additionally, the operation of adversarial perturbation also assists PerDoor in
developing non-uniform trigger patterns for backdoor inputs compared to uniform
triggers (with fixed patterns and locations) of existing backdoor techniques,
which are prone to be easily mitigated.

approach for interpage dependency extraction, inspired by the dependency
parsing literature. We further design a multi-task training approach to jointly
optimize for page embeddings to be used in segmentation, classification, and
parsing of the page dependencies using textual and visual features extracted
from the pages. Moreover, we also combine the features from two modalities to
obtain multimodal page embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to extract rich semantic interpage relations from multi-page
documents. Our experimental results show that the proposed method increased LAS

structure and stability is frequently assessed using metrics including the
virial parameter and Larson (1981) scaling relationships between cloud radius,
velocity dispersion, and surface density. Departures from the typical Galactic
relationships between these quantities have been observed in low-metallicity
environments. The amount of H$_2$ gas in cloud envelopes without corresponding
CO emission is expected to be high under these conditions; therefore, this
""CO-dark"" gas could plausibly be responsible for the observed variations in
cloud properties. We derive simple corrections that can be applied to empirical
clump properties (mass, radius, velocity dispersion, surface density, and
virial parameter) to account for CO-dark gas in clumps following power-law and
Plummer mass density profiles. We find that CO-dark gas is not likely to be the
cause of departures from Larson's relationships in low-metallicity regions, but
that virial parameters may be systematically overestimated. We demonstrate that
correcting for CO-dark gas is critical for accurately comparing the dynamical

recognition tasks. The adaptation is challenging because of heavy computation
and memory storage. Each model needs an independent and complete finetuning
process to adapt to different tasks, which limits its transferability to
different visual domains. To address this challenge, we propose an effective
adaptation approach for Transformer, namely AdaptFormer, which can adapt the
pre-trained ViTs into many different image and video tasks efficiently. It
possesses several benefits more appealing than prior arts. Firstly, AdaptFormer
introduces lightweight modules that only add less than 2% extra parameters to a
ViT, while it is able to increase the ViT's transferability without updating
its original pre-trained parameters, significantly outperforming the existing
100\% fully fine-tuned models on action recognition benchmarks. Secondly, it
can be plug-and-play in different Transformers and scalable to many visual
tasks. Thirdly, extensive experiments on five image and video datasets show
that AdaptFormer largely improves ViTs in the target domains. For example, when
updating just 1.5% extra parameters, it achieves about 10% and 19% relative
improvement compared to the fully fine-tuned models on Something-Something~v2

robotics problem, in which a robot, usually controlled by a DRL agent, needs to
efficiently and safely navigate through an unknown arena towards a target. We
demonstrate how modern verification engines can be used for effective model
selection, i.e., selecting the best available policy for the robot in question
from a pool of candidate policies. Specifically, we use verification to detect
and rule out policies that may demonstrate suboptimal behavior, such as
collisions and infinite loops. We also apply verification to identify models
with overly conservative behavior, thus allowing users to choose superior
policies, which might be better at finding shorter paths to a target. To
validate our work, we conducted extensive experiments on an actual robot, and
confirmed that the suboptimal policies detected by our method were indeed

multiple access channels (MACs) obtained from nonlocal games. For any MAC in
this family, we obtain an upper bound on the sum rate that depends only on the
properties of the game when allowing assistance from an arbitrary set of

separations between sum capacities when the senders are allowed to share
different sets of correlations, such as classical, quantum or no-signalling

approach of bounding the sum capacity by relaxing the nonconvex optimization
can give arbitrarily loose bounds. Towards a potential solution to this
problem, we first prove a Lipschitz-like property for the mutual information.
Using a modification of existing algorithms for optimizing Lipschitz-continuous
functions, we then show that it is possible to compute the sum capacity of an
arbitrary two-sender MAC to a fixed additive precision in quasi-polynomial

that tidally resonant neutron star ocean waves may serve as a never-before

star-black hole and binary neutron star mergers. If accompanied by
electromagnetic flares, tidally resonant neutron star ocean waves, whose energy

tidal waves will coincide with neutron star parabolic encounters. Depending on

numerous vision downstream tasks, but how and where MIM works remain unclear.
In this paper, we compare MIM with the long-dominant supervised pre-trained

uncover their key representational differences. From the visualizations, we
find that MIM brings locality inductive bias to all layers of the trained
models, but supervised models tend to focus locally at lower layers but more
globally at higher layers. That may be the reason why MIM helps Vision
Transformers that have a very large receptive field to optimize. Using MIM, the
model can maintain a large diversity on attention heads in all layers. But for
supervised models, the diversity on attention heads almost disappears from the
last three layers and less diversity harms the fine-tuning performance. From
the experiments, we find that MIM models can perform significantly better on
geometric and motion tasks with weak semantics or fine-grained classification
tasks, than their supervised counterparts. Without bells and whistles, a

Using the CosmoBit module of the global fitting framework GAMBIT, we combine
state-of-the-art calculations of the irreducible ALP freeze-in abundance,
primordial element abundances (including photodisintegration through ALP
decays), CMB spectral distortions and anisotropies, and constraints from
supernovae and stellar cooling. This approach makes it possible for the first
time to perform a global analysis of the ALP parameter space while varying the
parameters of $\Lambda$CDM as well as several nuisance parameters. We find a
lower bound on the ALP mass of around $m_a > 300\,\text{keV}$, which can only
be evaded if ALPs are stable on cosmological timescales. Future observations of
CMB spectral distortions with a PIXIE-like mission are expected to improve this

the presence of new physics in such transitions, as suggested by the

currently debated are a proton-proton collider at 100 TeV (FCC-hh) and a

L_\tau}$, the scalar leptoquark $S_3$, and the vector leptoquark $U_1$. We find
that a 3 TeV MuC has a sensitivity reach comparable to the one of the FCC-hh.
However, for a heavy enough mediator, the new physics effects at a 3 TeV MuC
are only observed indirectly via deviations in the highest energy bin, while
the FCC-hh has a greater potential for the discovery of a resonance. Finally,

TNG-Dark counterparts and those which do not, and develop models for the radial
positions of each. We find the satellites with TNG-Dark counterparts are
displaced towards the halo centre in the full-physics simulations, and this
difference has a power-law behaviour with radius. For the `orphan' galaxies

established under mild regularity conditions. In addition, this method can be
extended to approximate the variants of GW distance, including the entropic GW

such work has broad practical applications in a variety of situations, ranging
from drug and material design to telecommunications. The large decision space
of possible reconfigurations, however, makes this problem computationally
intensive. In this paper, we cast the problem of network rewiring for
optimizing a specified structural property as a Markov Decision Process (MDP),
in which a decision-maker is given a budget of modifications that are performed
sequentially. We then propose a general approach based on the Deep Q-Network
(DQN) algorithm and graph neural networks (GNNs) that can efficiently learn

map of the system they plan to penetrate; if the network is effectively
""scrambled"", they would not be able to navigate it since their prior knowledge
would become obsolete. This can be viewed as an entropy maximization problem,
in which the goal is to increase the surprise of the network. Indeed, entropy
acts as a proxy measurement of the difficulty of navigating the network
topology. We demonstrate the general ability of the proposed method to obtain
better entropy gains than random rewiring on synthetic and real-world graphs
while being computationally inexpensive, as well as being able to generalize to
larger graphs than those seen during training. Simulations of attack scenarios

such wavelets due to their compact time-frequency signature. As a further test,
we investigate the robustness of this analysis against waveform systematics

of the esophagus associated with elevated esophageal eosinophils. Second only
to gastroesophageal reflux disease, EoE is one of the leading causes of chronic
refractory dysphagia in adults and children. EoE diagnosis requires enumerating
the density of esophageal eosinophils in esophageal biopsies, a somewhat
subjective task that is time-consuming, thus reducing the ability to process
the complex tissue structure. Previous artificial intelligence (AI) approaches
that aimed to improve histology-based diagnosis focused on recapitulating
identification and quantification of the area of maximal eosinophil density.
However, this metric does not account for the distribution of eosinophils or
other histological features, over the whole slide image. Here, we developed an
artificial intelligence platform that infers local and spatial biomarkers based
on semantic segmentation of intact eosinophils and basal zone distributions.
Besides the maximal density of eosinophils (referred to as Peak Eosinophil
Count [PEC]) and a maximal basal zone fraction, we identify two additional
metrics that reflect the distribution of eosinophils and basal zone fractions.
This approach enables a decision support system that predicts EoE activity and
classifies the histological severity of EoE patients. We utilized a cohort that
includes 1066 biopsy slides from 400 subjects to validate the system's
performance and achieved a histological severity classification accuracy of
86.70%, sensitivity of 84.50%, and specificity of 90.09%. Our approach
highlights the importance of systematically analyzing the distribution of
biopsy features over the entire slide and paves the way towards a personalized
decision support system that will assist not only in counting cells but can
also potentially improve diagnosis and provide treatment prediction.

supervised training procedure for RSNNs, where a second network is introduced

activity of each layer to its target. The proposed full-FORCE training
procedure reduces the amount of modifications needed to keep the error between
the output and target close to zero. These modifications control the feedback

exploiting the use of application specific hardware for solving optimisation
problems. Examples of solvers that use specialised hardware are IBM's Quantum
System One and D-wave's Quantum Annealer (QA) and Fujitsu's Digital Annealer
(DA). These solvers have been developed to optimise problems faster than
traditional meta-heuristics implemented on general purpose machines. Previous
research has shown that these solvers (can optimise many problems much quicker
than exact solvers such as GUROBI and CPLEX. Such conclusions have not been
made when comparing hardware solvers with classical evolutionary algorithms.
  Making a fair comparison between traditional evolutionary algorithms, such as
Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the DA (or other similar solvers) is challenging
because the later benefits from the use of application specific hardware while
evolutionary algorithms are often implemented on general-purpose machines.
Moreover, quantum or quantum-inspired solvers are limited to solving problems
in a specific format. A common formulation used is Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimisation (QUBO). Many optimisation problems are however constrained
and have natural representations that are non-binary. Converting such problems
to QUBO can lead to more problem difficulty and/or larger search space.
  The question addressed in this paper is whether quantum or quantum-inspired
solvers can optimise QUBO transformations of combinatorial optimisation
problems faster than classical evolutionary algorithms applied to the same
problems in their natural representations. We show that the DA often present
better average objective function values than GA on Travelling Salesman,
Quadratic Assignment and Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem instances.

analyze three cases: static network, randomly changing network, and
homophily-based dynamic network. Whereas the former two assume network
structure is independent of beliefs, the latter assumes that people tend to
communicate with those who have similar beliefs. We prove under general
conditions that both static and randomly changing networks converge to a single
set of beliefs among all individuals along with the rate of convergence. We
prove that homophily-based network structures do not in general converge to a
single set of beliefs shared by all and prove lower bounds on the number of
different limiting beliefs as a function of initial beliefs. We conclude by
discussing implications for prior theories and directions for future work.

  To each Riemann function we associate a related function $W\colon{\mathbb
Z}^n\to{\mathbb Z}$ via M\""obius inversion that we call the {\em weight} of the
Riemann function. We give evidence that the weight seems to organize the
structure of a Riemann function in a simpler way: first, a Riemann function $f$
satisfies a Riemann-Roch formula iff its weight satisfies a simpler symmetry
condition. Second, we will calculate the weight of the Baker-Norine rank for
certain graphs and show that the weight function is quite simple to describe;
we do this for graphs on two vertices and for the complete graph.
  For the complete graph, we build on the work of Cori and Le Borgne who gave a
linear time method to compute the Baker-Norine rank of the complete graph. The
associated weight function has a simple formula and is extremely sparse (i.e.,
mostly zero). Our computation of the weight function leads to another linear
time algorithm to compute the Baker-Norine rank, via a formula likely related
to one of Cori and Le Borgne, but seemingly simpler, namely $$ r_{{\rm

various tasks, most prominent example being Shor's algorithm for efficient
prime factorization on a quantum computer. It is clear that one of the reasons
for the speedup is the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, which
allows a quantum processor to be in a superposition of different states at the
same time. While such superposition can lead to entanglement across different
qubits of the processors, there also exists quantum algorithms which outperform
classical ones using superpositions of individual qubits without entangling
them. As an example, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm allows one to determine a
bit string encoded into an oracle. While the classical version of the algorithm
requires multiple calls of the oracle to learn the bit string, a single query
of the oracle is enough in the quantum case. In this Letter, we analyze in
detail the quantum resources in the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. For this, we
introduce and study its probabilistic version, where the goal is to guess the
bit string after a single call of the oracle. We show that in the absence of
entanglement, the performance of the algorithm is directly related to the
amount of quantum coherence in the initial state. We further demonstrate that a
large amount of entanglement in the initial state prevents the algorithm from
achieving optimal performance. We also apply our methods to quantum computation
with mixed states, proving that pseudopure states achieve optimal performance
for a given purity in the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. We further investigate
quantum resources in the one clean qubit model, showing that the model can
exhibit speedup over any known classical algorithm even with arbitrary little

poisoning attacks. An adversary can embed a hidden backdoor into a model to
manipulate its predictions by only modifying a few training data, without
controlling the training process. Currently, a tangible signature has been
widely observed across a diverse set of backdoor poisoning attacks -- models
trained on a poisoned dataset tend to learn separable latent representations
for poison and clean samples. This latent separation is so pervasive that a
family of backdoor defenses directly take it as a default assumption (dubbed
latent separability assumption), based on which to identify poison samples via
cluster analysis in the latent space. An intriguing question consequently
follows: is the latent separation unavoidable for backdoor poisoning attacks?
This question is central to understanding whether the assumption of latent
separability provides a reliable foundation for defending against backdoor
poisoning attacks. In this paper, we design adaptive backdoor poisoning attacks
to present counter-examples against this assumption. Our methods include two
key components: (1) a set of trigger-planted samples correctly labeled to their
semantic classes (other than the target class) that can regularize backdoor
learning; (2) asymmetric trigger planting strategies that help to boost attack
success rate (ASR) as well as to diversify latent representations of poison
samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness
of our adaptive attacks in bypassing existing latent separation based backdoor
defenses. Moreover, our attacks still maintain a high attack success rate with
negligible clean accuracy drop. Our studies call for defense designers to take
caution when leveraging latent separation as an assumption in their defenses.

backdoor poison samples into training datasets. In this work, we investigate
how to detect such poison samples to mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks.
First, we uncover a post-hoc workflow underlying most prior work, where
defenders passively allow the attack to proceed and then leverage the
characteristics of the post-attacked model to uncover poison samples. We reveal
that this workflow does not fully exploit defenders' capabilities, and defense
pipelines built on it are prone to failure or performance degradation in many
scenarios. Second, we suggest a paradigm shift by promoting a proactive mindset
in which defenders engage proactively with the entire model training and poison
detection pipeline, directly enforcing and magnifying distinctive
characteristics of the post-attacked model to facilitate poison detection.
Based on this, we formulate a unified framework and provide practical insights
on designing detection pipelines that are more robust and generalizable. Third,
we introduce the technique of Confusion Training (CT) as a concrete
instantiation of our framework. CT applies an additional poisoning attack to
the already poisoned dataset, actively decoupling benign correlation while
exposing backdoor patterns to detection. Empirical evaluations on 4 datasets

into a chosen set of redshift bins. This is achieved by combining simulated
annealing, an optimisation algorithm inspired by solid-state physics, with an
unsupervised machine learning method, a self-organising map (SOM) of the
observed colours of galaxies. Starting with a sample of galaxies that is
divided into redshift bins based on a photometric redshift point estimate, the
simulated annealing algorithm repeatedly reassigns SOM-selected subsamples of
galaxies, which are close in colour, to alternative redshift bins. We optimise
the clustering cross-correlation signal between photometric galaxies and a
reference sample of galaxies with well-calibrated redshifts. Depending on the
effect on the clustering signal, the reassignment is either accepted or
rejected. By dynamically increasing the resolution of the SOM, the algorithm
eventually converges to a solution that minimises the number of mismatched
galaxies in each tomographic redshift bin and thus improves the compactness of
their corresponding redshift distribution. This method is demonstrated on the
synthetic LSST cosmoDC2 catalogue. We find a significant decrease in the
fraction of catastrophic outliers in the redshift distribution in all
tomographic bins, most notably in the highest redshift bin with a decrease in
the outlier fraction from 57 per cent to 16 per cent.

lost sensory function or augment human capabilities. However, sensations
elicited by current devices often appear artificial and distorted. Although
current models can predict the neural or perceptual response to an electrical
stimulus, an optimal stimulation strategy solves the inverse problem: what is
the required stimulus to produce a desired response? Here, we frame this as an
end-to-end optimization problem, where a deep neural network stimulus encoder
is trained to invert a known and fixed forward model that approximates the
underlying biological system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of this Hybrid Neural Autoencoder (HNA) in visual
neuroprostheses. We find that HNA produces high-fidelity patient-specific
stimuli representing handwritten digits and segmented images of everyday
objects, and significantly outperforms conventional encoding strategies across
all simulated patients. Overall this is an important step towards the
long-standing challenge of restoring high-quality vision to people living with
incurable blindness and may prove a promising solution for a variety of
neuroprosthetic technologies.

  overlap with arXiv:1901.04945",,,,"q-fin.ST q-fin.RM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In an earlier study, we showed that Tsallis relative entropy (TRE), which is
the generalization of Kullback-Leibler relative entropy (KLRE) to non-extensive
systems, can be used as a possible risk measure in constructing risk optimal
portfolios whose returns beat market returns. Over a long term (> 10 years),
the risk-return profiles from TRE as the risk measure show a more consistent
behavior than those from the commonly used risk measure 'beta' of the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In these investigations, the model distributions
derived from TRE are symmetric. However, observations show that distributions
of the returns of financial markets and equities are in general asymmetric in
positive and negative returns. In this work, we generalize TRE for the
asymmetric case (ATRE) by considering the data distribution as a linear
combination of two independent normalized distributions - one for negative
returns and one for positive returns. Each of these two independent
distributions are half q-Gaussians with different non-extensivity parameter q
and temperature parameter b. The risk-return (in excess of market returns)
patterns are investigated using ATRE as the risk measure. The results are
compared with those from two other risk measures: TRE and the Tsallis relative
entropy S- derived from the negative returns only. Tests on data, which include
the dot-com bubble, the 2008 crash, and COVID periods, for both long (20 years)
and shorter terms (10 years), show that a linear fit can be obtained for the
risk-excess return profiles of all three risk measures. However, the fits for
portfolios created during the chaotic market conditions (crashes) using S- as
the risk show a much higher slope pointing to higher returns for a given risk
value. Further, in this case, the excess returns of even short-term portfolios
remain positive irrespective of the market behavior.

includes an analysis at the panel level where the selection process takes
place, and this enables to study bias more in-depth at the process level. The
findings are: (i) After controlling for merit, a consistent pattern of gender
bias was found in the scores: women receive significant lower grades than men
do. (ii) The scores are an input into the two-step decision-making process, and
this study shows bias against women in the first selection decision where 75%
of the applications are rejected, and bias in favor of women in the second
(final) selection decision. (iii) At the level of individual panels, the
analysis shows a mixed pattern of bias: in some panels the odds for women to
receive a grant are lower than for men, whereas in other panels we find the
opposite, next to panels with gender-neutral decision making. (iv) In the case
under study, at an aggregated level the allocation of grants seems balanced.
(v) The mixed pattern at panel level seems to relate characteristics such as
the panel composition, and the level of gender stereotyping.

to predict the precursor functions that evolve into the universal Isgur-Wise

other sources where such are available. The study also exposes effects on the

understanding brain regularity and variability. Despite numerous efforts, it is
still difficult to infer reliable anatomical correspondence at finer scale,
given the tremendous individual variability in cortical folding patterns. It is
even more challenging to disentangle common and individual patterns when
comparing brains at different neuro-developmental stages. In this work, we
developed a novel learning-based few-shot embedding framework to encode the
cortical folding patterns into a latent space represented by a group of
anatomically meaningful embedding vectors. Specifically, we adopted 3-hinge
(3HG) network as the substrate and designed an autoencoder-based embedding
framework to learn a common embedding vector for each 3HG's multi-hop feature:
each 3HG can be represented as a combination of these feature embeddings via a
set of individual specific coefficients to characterize individualized
anatomical information. That is, the regularity of folding patterns is encoded
into the embeddings, while the individual variations are preserved by the
multi=hop combination coefficients. To effectively learn the embeddings for the
population with very limited samples, few-shot learning was adopted. We applied
our method on adult HCP and pediatric datasets with 1,000+ brains (from 34
gestational weeks to young adult). Our experimental results show that: 1) the
learned embedding vectors can quantitatively encode the commonality and
individuality of cortical folding patterns; 2) with the embeddings we can
robustly infer the complicated many-to-many anatomical correspondences among
different brains and 3) our model can be successfully transferred to new
populations with very limited training samples.

from turbulence in Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics (AO) can only partially
compensate for these effects. Neither multi-frame blind deconvolution (MFBD)
nor speckle techniques restore AO-compensated images to the correct power
spectrum and contrast. MFBD can only compensate for a finite number of
low-order aberrations, leaving a tail of uncorrected high-order modes. Speckle
restoration of AO-corrected data depends on calibrations of the AO corrections
and assumptions regarding the height distribution of atmospheric turbulence. We
seek to develop an improvement to MFBD that combines speckle's usage of
turbulence statistics to account for high-order modes with the ability of MFBD
to sense low-order modes that can be partially corrected by AO and/or include
fixed or slowly changing instrumental aberrations. We modify the
image-formation model, supplementing the fitted low-order wavefront aberrations
with tails of random high-order aberrations. These tails follow Kolmogorov
statistics scaled to estimated or measured values of Fried's parameter, r0,
that characterize the strength of the seeing at the moment of data collection.
We refer to this as statistical diversity (SD). We test MFBD with SD with
noise-free synthetic data, simulating many different r0 and numbers of
AO-corrected modes. SD improves the contrasts and power spectra of restored
images, both in accuracy and in consistency with varying r0, without penalty in
processing time. With focus diversity (FD), the results are almost perfect. SD
also reduces errors in the fitted wavefront parameters. MFBD with SD and FD
seems resistant to several percents of error in r0. Adding SD to MFBD shows
great promise for improving contrasts and power spectra in restored images.
Further studies with real data are merited.

to themselves, known as homophily, is one of the most robust sociological
principles. Since this phenomenon can lead to patterns of interactions that
segregate people along different demographic dimensions, it can also lead to
inequalities in access to information, resources, and opportunities. As we
consider potential interventions that might alleviate the effects of
segregation, we face the challenge that homophily constitutes a pervasive and
organic force that is difficult to push back against. Designing effective
interventions can therefore benefit from identifying counterbalancing social
processes that might be harnessed to work in opposition to segregation.
  In this work, we show that triadic closure -- another common phenomenon that
posits that individuals with a mutual connection are more likely to be
connected to one another -- can be one such process. In doing so, we challenge
a long-held belief that triadic closure and homophily work in tandem. By
analyzing several fundamental network models using popular integration
measures, we demonstrate the desegregating potential of triadic closure. We
further empirically investigate this effect on real-world dynamic networks,
surfacing observations that mirror our theoretical findings. We leverage these
insights to discuss simple interventions that can help reduce segregation in
settings that exhibit an interplay between triadic closure and homophily. We
conclude with a discussion on qualitative implications for the design of
interventions in settings where individuals arrive in an online fashion, and
the designer can influence the initial set of connections.

characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging and the
observed nanopore geometries were analyzed through a pore-edge detection

the permeation properties at both individual pore and membrane-wide scales. As
an example, membranes featuring angstrom-scale pores were investigated in terms
of their emerging water and ion flow properties through extensive all-atom

ionised outflows in $\sim$15 per cent of our entire sample. Outflows are much
rarer in star-forming galaxies compared to AGN, and outflow incidence and
velocity increase with [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosity. Outflow incidence is
significantly elevated in the optical+mid-infrared selected AGN compared to
purely optical AGN; over 60 per cent show outflows at the highest luminosities

suggesting mid-infrared AGN selection favours galaxies with powerful outflows,
at least for higher [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosities. However, we find no
statistically significant difference in outflow incidence, velocity, and
luminosity in mergers compared to isolated galaxies, and there is no dependence
on merger stage. Therefore, while interactions are predicted to drive gas
inflows and subsequently trigger nuclear star formation and accretion activity,
when the power source of the outflow is controlled for, the merging environment
has no further impact on the large-scale ionised outflows as traced by [OIII]

within the single-degenerate scenario suggest that the non-degenerate

nearby supernova remnants. However, observational efforts show less promising
evidence on the existence of surviving companions from the standard
single-degenerate channels. The spin-up/spin-down models are possible
mechanisms to explain the non-detection of surviving companions. In these
models, the spin-up phase could increase the critical mass for explosion,
leading to a super-Chandrasekhar mass explosion, and the spin-down phase could
lead to extra mass loss and angular momentum redistribution. Since the
spin-down timescale for the delayed explosion of a rotating white dwarf is
unclear, in this paper, we explore a vast parameter space of main-sequence-like
surviving companions via two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of supernova
impact and the subsequent stellar evolution of surviving companions. Tight
universal relations to describe the mass stripping effect, supernova kick, and
depth of supernova heating are provided. Our results suggest that the not-yet
detected surviving companions from observations of nearby Type Ia supernova
remnants might favor low mass companions, short binary separation, or stronger
supernova explosion energies than the standard singe-degenerate channels.

this purpose, we employ a dataset of community-created fact-checks from
Twitter's Birdwatch pilot and map them to resharing cascades on Twitter.
Different from earlier studies analyzing the spread of misinformation listed on
third-party fact-checking websites (e.g., Snopes), we find that community
fact-checked misinformation is less viral. Specifically, misleading posts are
estimated to receive 36.62% fewer retweets than not misleading posts. A partial
explanation may lie in differences in the fact-checking targets: community
fact-checkers tend to fact-check posts from influential user accounts with many
followers, while expert fact-checks tend to target posts that are shared by
less influential users. We further find that there are significant differences
in virality across different sub-types of misinformation (e.g., factual errors,
missing context, manipulated media). Moreover, we conduct a user study to
assess the perceived reliability of (real-world) community-created fact-checks.
Here, we find that users, to a large extent, agree with community-created
fact-checks. Altogether, our findings offer insights into how misleading vs.

to ensure the correct execution of the program. This creates an optimization
problem with a vast and sparse search space for which finding a mapping
manually is impractical because it requires expertise and knowledge of the SE

used to model sequential operation placement. We show results on how certain

Such decomposed kernels have the potential to be very fast, and do not depend

lead to high dimensionality, and variable selection becomes paramount. This
paper reports a new method of forward variable selection, enabled by the
ordered nature of the basis functions in the KL expansion of the Bayesian
Smoothing Spline ANOVA kernel (BSS-ANOVA), coupled with fast Gibbs sampling in
a fully Bayesian approach. It quickly and effectively limits the number of

times for tabular datasets of low feature set dimensionality. The inference
speed and accuracy makes the method especially useful for dynamic systems
identification, by modeling the dynamics in the tangent space as a static
problem, then integrating the learned dynamics using a high-order scheme. The
methods are demonstrated on two dynamic datasets: a `Susceptible, Infected,

function, along with the experimental `Cascaded Tanks' benchmark dataset.
Comparisons on the static prediction of time derivatives are made with a random

intensity moments. We develop a model for probabilistic passing that accounts
for the order of arrival to a desired location and potential interceptions
along the way. This model is based on a player-specific motion model and a puck
motion model that determines how far each player can reach in the time it takes
the puck to get to a target. In addition, we model the rink control for each
team and the scoring probability of the offensive team. These models are then
combined into novel metrics for quantifying where a pass should be made such
that it would result in a high scoring opportunity or result in a high chance
of maintaining possession. Finally, we use various metrics to evaluate passes
made throughout the available power plays and compare them to the optimal
options at that time. This can be used to identify players' risk-reward
tendencies and can be used by coaches when selecting which players are best
suited for a power play given the circumstances of the game.

easily-matched pairs as new seeds to percolate and match other nodes. We
evaluate SeedGNN on both synthetic and real graphs, and demonstrate significant

leveraging the diversity among client data distributions via local updates. We
formally establish the iteration complexity required by the clients for proving

mode, preserving the nature of surface wrinkling in tubular structures, can be
induced under a plane-strain setup, and a smaller size of the unit cell is
attained compared to the counterpart of traditional buckled profile in soft
porous elastomers. In particular, this buckling pattern is able to produce
several bandgaps in different frequency ranges as the macroscopic mean strain
increases. We further introduce a metallic core as local resonator, and the
updated metamaterial allows a low-frequency bandgap, the bandgap width of which
can be estimated by a simplified theoretical model. As more free parameters are
involved in the structure, we perform a detailed parametric study to elucidate
the influences of the modulus ratio between coating and matrix, the porosity,
the core radius, and the macroscopic mean strain on the buckling initiation and
the evolution of bandgap. Remarkably, a stiffer surface coating is prone to
enhance the stability of the structure, which is contrary to existing results

inherent variance in observations - suffer less from active learning bias.
Finally, we demonstrate empirically that insights from the linear model can

diffusion into a nonlinear diffusion process is investigated by very few works.
The nonlinearity effect has been hardly understood, but intuitively, there
would be promising diffusion patterns to efficiently train the generative
distribution towards the data distribution. This paper introduces a
data-adaptive nonlinear diffusion process for score-based diffusion models. The
proposed Implicit Nonlinear Diffusion Model (INDM) learns by combining a
normalizing flow and a diffusion process. Specifically, INDM implicitly
constructs a nonlinear diffusion on the \textit{data space} by leveraging a
linear diffusion on the \textit{latent space} through a flow network. This flow
network is key to forming a nonlinear diffusion, as the nonlinearity depends on
the flow network. This flexible nonlinearity improves the learning curve of
INDM to nearly Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) against the non-MLE curve of
DDPM++, which turns out to be an inflexible version of INDM with the flow fixed
as an identity mapping. Also, the discretization of INDM shows the sampling
robustness. In experiments, INDM achieves the state-of-the-art FID of 1.75 on
CelebA. We release our code at https://github.com/byeonghu-na/INDM.

  Splitting",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved enormous success in tackling
analytical problems on graph data. Most GNNs interpret nearly all the node
connections as inductive bias with feature smoothness, and implicitly assume
strong homophily on the observed graph. However, real-world networks are not
always homophilic, but sometimes exhibit heterophilic patterns where adjacent
nodes share dissimilar attributes and distinct labels. Therefore,GNNs smoothing
the node proximity holistically may aggregate inconsistent information arising
from both task-relevant and irrelevant connections. In this paper, we propose a
novel edge splitting GNN (ES-GNN) framework, which generalizes GNNs beyond
homophily by jointly partitioning network topology and disentangling node
features. Specifically, the proposed framework employs an interpretable
operation to adaptively split the set of edges of the original graph into two
exclusive sets indicating respectively the task-relevant and irrelevant
relations among nodes. The node features are then aggregated separately on
these two partial edge sets to produce disentangled representations, based on
which a more accurate edge splitting can be attained later. Theoretically, we
show that our ES-GNN can be regarded as a solution to a graph denoising problem
with a disentangled smoothness assumption, which further illustrates our
motivations and interprets the improved generalization. Extensive experiments
over 8 benchmark and 1 synthetic datasets demonstrate that ES-GNN not only
outperforms the state-of-the-arts (including 8 GNN baselines), but also can be
more robust to adversarial graphs and alleviate the over-smoothing problem.

can be leveraged as the primary source of pessimism for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). We begin by identifying a critical flaw in a popular algorithmic
choice used by many ensemble-based RL algorithms, namely the use of shared
pessimistic target values when computing each ensemble member's Bellman error.
Through theoretical analyses and construction of examples in toy MDPs, we
demonstrate that shared pessimistic targets can paradoxically lead to value
estimates that are effectively optimistic. Given this result, we propose MSG, a
practical offline RL algorithm that trains an ensemble of $Q$-functions with
independently computed targets based on completely separate networks, and
optimizes a policy with respect to the lower confidence bound of predicted
action values. Our experiments on the popular D4RL and RL Unplugged offline RL
benchmarks demonstrate that on challenging domains such as antmazes, MSG with
deep ensembles surpasses highly well-tuned state-of-the-art methods by a wide
margin. Additionally, through ablations on benchmarks domains, we verify the
critical significance of using independently trained $Q$-functions, and study
the role of ensemble size. Finally, as using separate networks per ensemble
member can become computationally costly with larger neural network
architectures, we investigate whether efficient ensemble approximations
developed for supervised learning can be similarly effective, and demonstrate
that they do not match the performance and robustness of MSG with separate
networks, highlighting the need for new efforts into efficient uncertainty
estimation directed at RL.

health status. We demonstrate how communication in the brain can be estimated
from recorded neural activity using concepts from graph signal processing. The
communication is modeled as a flow signals on the edges of a graph and
naturally arises from a graph diffusion process. We apply the diffusion model
to local field potential (LFP) measurements of brain activity of two non-human
primates to estimate the communication flow during a stimulation experiment.
Comparisons with a baseline model demonstrate that adding the neural flow can
improve LFP predictions. Finally, we demonstrate how the neural flow can be
decomposed into a gradient and rotational component and show that the gradient
component depends on the location of stimulation.

aim to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) with neural networks, since
solving RPM puzzles is highly correlated with human intelligence. Unlike
previous methods that use auxiliary annotations or assume hidden rules to
produce appropriate feature representation, we only use the ground truth answer
of each question for model learning, aiming for an intelligent agent to have a
strong learning capability with a small amount of supervision. Based on the RPM
problem formulation, the correct answer filled into the missing entry of the
third row/column has to best satisfy the same rules shared between the first
two rows/columns. Thus we design a simple yet effective Dual-Contrast Network
(DCNet) to exploit the inherent structure of RPM puzzles. Specifically, a rule
contrast module is designed to compare the latent rules between the filled
row/column and the first two rows/columns; a choice contrast module is designed
to increase the relative differences between candidate choices. Experimental
results on the RAVEN and PGM datasets show that DCNet outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of 5.77%. Further experiments on few
training samples and model generalization also show the effectiveness of DCNet.

personal tasks. Because the personal context required to make accurate
predictions is often sensitive, we require systems that protect privacy. A gold
standard privacy-preserving system will satisfy perfect secrecy, meaning that
interactions with the system provably reveal no private information. However,
privacy and quality appear to be in tension in existing systems for personal
tasks. Neural models typically require copious amounts of training to perform
well, while individual users typically hold a limited scale of data, so
federated learning (FL) systems propose to learn from the aggregate data of
multiple users. FL does not provide perfect secrecy, but rather practitioners
apply statistical notions of privacy -- i.e., the probability of learning
private information about a user should be reasonably low. The strength of the
privacy guarantee is governed by privacy parameters. Numerous privacy attacks
have been demonstrated on FL systems and it can be challenging to reason about
the appropriate privacy parameters for a privacy-sensitive use case. Therefore
our work proposes a simple baseline for FL, which both provides the stronger
perfect secrecy guarantee and does not require setting any privacy parameters.
We initiate the study of when and where an emerging tool in ML -- the
in-context learning abilities of recent pretrained models -- can be an
effective baseline alongside FL. We find in-context learning is competitive
with strong FL baselines on 6 of 7 popular benchmarks from the privacy
literature and a real-world case study, which is disjoint from the pretraining
data. We release our code here: https://github.com/simran-arora/focus

  Medical Images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Test-time adaptation (TTA) has increasingly been an important topic to
efficiently tackle the cross-domain distribution shift at test time for medical
images from different institutions. Previous TTA methods have a common
limitation of using a fixed learning rate for all the test samples. Such a
practice would be sub-optimal for TTA, because test data may arrive
sequentially therefore the scale of distribution shift would change frequently.
To address this problem, we propose a novel dynamic learning rate adjustment
method for test-time adaptation, called DLTTA, which dynamically modulates the
amount of weights update for each test image to account for the differences in
their distribution shift. Specifically, our DLTTA is equipped with a memory
bank based estimation scheme to effectively measure the discrepancy of a given
test sample. Based on this estimated discrepancy, a dynamic learning rate
adjustment strategy is then developed to achieve a suitable degree of
adaptation for each test sample. The effectiveness and general applicability of
our DLTTA is extensively demonstrated on three tasks including retinal optical
coherence tomography (OCT) segmentation, histopathological image
classification, and prostate 3D MRI segmentation. Our method achieves effective
and fast test-time adaptation with consistent performance improvement over
current state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods. Code is available at:

are generated by simple processes. We focus on the model of locally samplable
sources, where each bit in the source depends on a small number of (hidden)
uniformly random input bits. Also known as local sources, this model was
introduced by De and Watson (TOCT 2012) and Viola (SICOMP 2014), and is closely
related to sources generated by $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits and bounded-width
branching programs. In particular, extractors for local sources also work for
sources generated by these classical computational models.
  Despite being introduced a decade ago, little progress has been made on
improving the entropy requirement for extracting from local sources. The
current best explicit extractors require entropy $n^{1/2}$, and follow via a
reduction to affine extractors. To start, we prove a barrier showing that one
cannot hope to improve this entropy requirement via a black-box reduction of
this form. In particular, new techniques are needed.
  In our main result, we seek to answer whether low-degree polynomials (over
$\mathbb{F}_2$) hold potential for breaking this barrier. We answer this
question in the positive, and fully characterize the power of low-degree
polynomials as extractors for local sources. More precisely, we show that a
random degree $r$ polynomial is a low-error extractor for $n$-bit local sources
with min-entropy $\Omega(r(n\log n)^{1/r})$, and we show that this is tight.
  Our result leverages several new ingredients, which may be of independent
interest. Our existential result relies on a new reduction from local sources
to a more structured family, known as local non-oblivious bit-fixing sources.
To show its tightness, we prove a ""local version"" of a structural result by
Cohen and Tal (RANDOM 2015), which relies on a new ""low-weight""
Chevalley-Warning theorem.

Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) model.
  Our approach is based on the observation that each IPC optimization step used
to minimize the elasticity, contact, and friction potentials leads to linear
trajectories even in the presence of nonlinear meshes or nonlinear FE bases. It
is thus possible to retain the strong non-penetration guarantees and large time
steps of the original formulation while benefiting from the high-order bases

unlike humans, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) lacks high-order intelligence
(e.g., logic deduction and reuse), thus it behaves ineffectively than humans
regarding learning and generalization in complex problems. Previous works
attempt to directly synthesize a white-box logic program as the DRL policy,
manifesting logic-driven behaviors. However, most synthesis methods are built
on imperative or declarative programming, and each has a distinct limitation,
respectively. The former ignores the cause-effect logic during synthesis,
resulting in low generalizability across tasks. The latter is strictly
proof-based, thus failing to synthesize programs with complex hierarchical
logic. In this paper, we combine the above two paradigms together and propose a
novel Generalizable Logic Synthesis (GALOIS) framework to synthesize
hierarchical and strict cause-effect logic programs. GALOIS leverages the
program sketch and defines a new sketch-based hybrid program language for
guiding the synthesis. Based on that, GALOIS proposes a sketch-based program
synthesis method to automatically generate white-box programs with
generalizable and interpretable cause-effect logic. Extensive evaluations on
various decision-making tasks with complex logic demonstrate the superiority of
GALOIS over mainstream baselines regarding the asymptotic performance,
generalizability, and great knowledge reusability across different
environments.

of matrices with entries in the complex-valued functions of a topological space
(matrices over spaces). Specifically, we here consider the question of unitary
equivalence for pairs of normal matrices over a space that share a common
characteristic polynomial that can be globally factored into distinct linear
factors. We show that such a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if the first
Chern classes of its eigenbundles all vanish and derive as an application that
all such matrices over $\mathbb{C}P^m$ are diagonalizable for $m > 1$. Next,
given a CW complex $X$ and a polynomial $\mu$ in $C(X)[\lambda]$ that globally
splits into distinct linear factors, we prove that the number of unitary
equivalence classes of matrices with $\mu$ as a characteristic polynomial
depends only on the space $X$ and the degree of $\mu$, and we give some
estimates on how many unitary equivalence classes there can be. In the case
that $X$ is a CW complex of dimension at most three, we demonstrate a bijection
between the unitary equivalence classes of $n \times n$ normal matrices with
characteristic polynomial $\mu$ and elements of the group $(H^2(X))^{n-1}$.
Finally, when $X$ is a smooth manifold and we restrict to matrices with smooth

attention and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based structure-aware attention. With
top-$k$ sparse attention, the most crucial attention relation can be obtained
with a lower computational cost. As the code structure represents the logic of

and standard processing methods based on hyperbolic fitting are applied to the
hyperbolae reflection patterns of tree roots for detection purposes. When the
surface of the land is undulating (not flat), these typical hyperbolic fitting
methods becomes inaccurate. This is because, the reflection patterns change
with the uneven ground surfaces. When the soil surface is not flat, it is
inaccurate to use the peak point of an asymmetric reflection pattern to
identify the depth and horizontal position of the underground target. The
reflection patterns of the complex shapes due to extreme surface variations
results in analysis difficulties. Furthermore, when multiple objects are buried
under an undulating ground, it is hard to judge their relative positions based
on a B-scan that assumes a flat ground. In this paper, a roots fitting method
based on electromagnetic waves (EM) travel time analysis is proposed to take
into consideration the realistic undulating ground surface. A wheel-based (WB)

received increasing attention over recent years. Instance-level GNN explanation
aims to discover critical input elements, like nodes or edges, that the target
GNN relies upon for making predictions. Though various algorithms are proposed,
most of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph which can
preserve original predictions. However, an inductive bias is deep-rooted in
this framework: several subgraphs can result in the same or similar outputs as
the original graphs. Consequently, they have the danger of providing spurious
explanations and fail to provide consistent explanations. Applying them to
explain weakly-performed GNNs would further amplify these issues. To address
this problem, we theoretically examine the predictions of GNNs from the
causality perspective. Two typical reasons of spurious explanations are
identified: confounding effect of latent variables like distribution shift, and
causal factors distinct from the original input. Observing that both
confounding effects and diverse causal rationales are encoded in internal
representations, we propose a simple yet effective countermeasure by aligning
embeddings. Concretely, concerning potential shifts in the high-dimensional
space, we design a distribution-aware alignment algorithm based on anchors.
This new objective is easy to compute and can be incorporated into existing
techniques with no or little effort. Theoretical analysis shows that it is in

autoregression in handling time series data, its coefficient tensor already has
the order of six. This paper revises a newly proposed tensor train (TT)
decomposition and then applies it to tensor regression such that a nice

match the data with hierarchical structures, and it even can lead to a better
interpretation for the data with factorial structures, which are supposed to be
better fitted by models with Tucker decomposition. More importantly, the new
tensor regression can be easily applied to the case with higher order tensors
since TT decomposition can compress the coefficient tensors much more
efficiently. The methodology is also extended to tensor autoregression for time
series data, and nonasymptotic properties are derived for the ordinary least

creases introduce geometric discontinuity and often have complex mechanical
responses due to the local material damage. In this work, we propose a
continuous description of the sharp geometry of creases and apply it to the
study of \emph{creased annuli}, made by introducing radial creases to annular
strips with the creases annealed to behave elastically. We find creased annuli
have generic bistability and can be folded into various compact shapes,
depending on the crease pattern and the overcurvature of the flat annulus. We
use a regularized Dirac delta function (RDDF) to describe the geometry of a
crease, with the finite spike of the RDDF capturing the localized curvature.
Together with anisotropic rod theory, we solve the nonlinear mechanics of
creased annuli, with its stability determined by the standard conjugate point
test. We find excellent agreement between precision tabletop models, numerical
predictions from our analytical framework, and modeling results from finite
element simulations. We further show that by varying the rest curvature of the
thin strip, dynamic switches between different states of creased annuli can be
achieved, which could inspire the design of novel deployable and morphable

mixed multi-layer attention (MBMFN), which realizes the multiple utilization of
features and the multistage fusion of different levels of features. To further
improve the networks performance, we propose a lightweight enhanced residual
channel attention (LERCA), which can not only effectively avoid the loss of
channel information but also make the network pay more attention to the key
channel information and benefit from it. Finally, the attention mechanism is
introduced into the reconstruction process to strengthen the restoration of
edge texture and other details. A large number of experiments on several
benchmark sets show that, compared with other advanced reconstruction
algorithms, our algorithm produces highly competitive objective indicators and
restores more image detail texture information.

boundary $\partial \Sigma=\Gamma$ at infinity, whose principal curvatures
$\kappa=(\kappa_1,\ldots,\kappa_n)$ lie in a general cone $K$ and satisfy
$f(\kappa)=\sigma$ at each point of $\Sigma$. Previously, the problem has been
studied by Guan-Spruck in [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 12 (2010), no. 3,

where $\sigma_0>0$. A major ingredient of our proof is a refined curvature
estimate of theirs that is applicable when the curvature function $f(\kappa)$
has controllable (not necessarily bounded) partial derivatives, but it is
adequate for our purpose; specifically, we solve the problem for
$f=H_{k}/H_{k-1}$ in the $k$-th Garding cone where $H_k$ is the normalized

an ideal solution for how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, and
how to develop polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design.
In this work, we tackle these problems through the development of our periodic

comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts for the
periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN)
that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn
chemically-relevant polymer descriptors. Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer

representation leads to a considerable improvement in the accuracy and

critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human
variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in
viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of
protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most
successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these
methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and
diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited
by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large
language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences
from diverse families address these problems and show potential to eventually
bridge the performance gap. We introduce Tranception, a novel transformer
architecture leveraging autoregressive predictions and retrieval of homologous
sequences at inference to achieve state-of-the-art fitness prediction
performance. Given its markedly higher performance on multiple mutants,
robustness to shallow alignments and ability to score indels, our approach
offers significant gain of scope over existing approaches. To enable more
rigorous model testing across a broader range of protein families, we develop
ProteinGym -- an extensive set of multiplexed assays of variant effects,
substantially increasing both the number and diversity of assays compared to
existing benchmarks.

high-quality $\gamma$ radiation source. It is easier achieved in experiment by
employing a pulse based on laser wakefield accelerator. The driving laser is
backward reflected when wakefield acceleration stage is over and thus it
naturally collides with energetic electrons. To increase reflected pulse
intensity, parabolic focusing plasma mirror instead of flat reflecting target
is usually adopted. But concave focusing mirror also deteriorates the emitted
photon beam monochromaticity and collimation. We propose using stepped focusing
plasma mirror to reflect the driving pulse to conquer these issues. The
longitudinal length of reflected pulse by stepped target is larger and
intensity is relatively small. It leads emitted photon beam to have better
monochromaticity and collimation except for having larger emitted energy and
higher laser utilization efficiency. We affirm the robustness of stepped
focusing mirror reflecting regime through various kinds of numerical
simulations.

detector for LiDAR point clouds of autonomous driving scenes, termed
FCOS-LiDAR. Unlike the dominant methods that use the bird-eye view (BEV), our
proposed detector detects objects from the range view (RV, a.k.a. range image)
of the LiDAR points. Due to the range view's compactness and compatibility with
the LiDAR sensors' sampling process on self-driving cars, the range view-based
object detector can be realized by solely exploiting the vanilla 2D
convolutions, departing from the BEV-based methods which often involve
complicated voxelization operations and sparse convolutions.
  For the first time, we show that an RV-based 3D detector with standard 2D
convolutions alone can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art
BEV-based detectors while being significantly faster and simpler. More
importantly, almost all previous range view-based detectors only focus on
single-frame point clouds, since it is challenging to fuse multi-frame point
clouds into a single range view. In this work, we tackle this challenging issue
with a novel range view projection mechanism, and for the first time
demonstrate the benefits of fusing multi-frame point clouds for a range-view
based detector. Extensive experiments on nuScenes show the superiority of our
proposed method and we believe that our work can be strong evidence that an
RV-based 3D detector can compare favourably with the current mainstream
BEV-based detectors.

It is necessary for computation of an OT problem to solve linear programming

application to large-scale problems. To address this issue, loosening such

algorithm. This approach has demonstrated its effectiveness for applications.
However, it remains slow. As a superior alternative, we propose a fast
block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) algorithm for a convex semi-relaxed OT.
Specifically, we prove their upper bounds of the worst convergence iterations,

depends on the magnetization direction in the crystal and is independent of the
current orientation. First-principles calculations reveal that the fourfold AMR
arises from the relaxation time anisotropy due to the variation of the density
of states near the Fermi energy under rotation of the magnetization. This
relaxation time anisotropy is a universal property in ferromagnetic metals and
determines other anisotropic physical properties that are observable in

submicron-sized grains is essential to unveiling how planetesimals formed in

dust particles strongly depends on the strength of viscous dissipation force;
however, impacts of viscous dissipation on the collisional behavior of dust
aggregates have not been studied in detail, especially for the cases of oblique
collisions. Here we investigated the impacts of viscous dissipation on the
collisional behavior of dust aggregates. We performed numerical simulations of
collisions between two equal-mass dust aggregates with various collision
velocities and impact parameters. We also changed the strength of viscous
dissipation force systematically. We found that the threshold collision
velocity for the fragmentation of dust aggregates barely depends on the
strength of viscous dissipation force when we consider oblique collisions. In
contrast, the size distribution of fragments changes significantly when the
viscous dissipation force is considered. We obtained the empirical fitting
formulae for the size distribution of fragments for the case of strong
dissipation, which would be useful to study the evolution of size and spatial
distributions of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks.

Unfortunately, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect and annotate
bitemporal samples containing desired changes. Transfer learning from
pre-trained models is effective to alleviate label insufficiency in remote
sensing (RS) change detection (CD). We explore the use of semantic information
during pre-training. Different from traditional supervised pre-training that
learns the mapping from image to label, we incorporate semantic supervision
into the self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Typically, multiple objects
of interest (e.g., buildings) are distributed in various locations in an
uncurated RS image. Instead of manipulating image-level representations via
global pooling, we introduce point-level supervision on per-pixel embeddings to
learn spatially-sensitive features, thus benefiting downstream dense CD. To
achieve this, we obtain multiple points via class-balanced sampling on the
overlapped area between views using the semantic mask. We learn an embedding
space where background and foreground points are pushed apart, and spatially
aligned points across views are pulled together. Our intuition is the resulting
semantically discriminative representations invariant to irrelevant changes
(illumination and unconcerned land covers) may help change recognition. We
collect large-scale image-mask pairs freely available in the RS community for
pre-training. Extensive experiments on three CD datasets verify the
effectiveness of our method. Ours significantly outperforms ImageNet
pre-training, in-domain supervision, and several SSL methods. Empirical results
indicate our pre-training improves the generalization and data efficiency of
the CD model. Notably, we achieve competitive results using 20% training data
than baseline (random initialization) using 100% data. Our code is available.

CPU frequency, computation model size, and image offloading frequency based on
user preferences, camera sampling rates, and available radio resources. Our
proposed dynamic MAR configuration adaptations can minimize the per frame
energy consumption of multiple MAR clients without degrading their preferred
MAR performance metrics, such as latency and detection accuracy. To thoroughly
analyze the interactions among MAR configurations, user preferences, camera
sampling rate, and energy consumption, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first comprehensive analytical energy model for MAR devices.
Based on the proposed analytical model, we design a LEAF optimization algorithm
to guide the MAR configuration adaptation and server radio resource allocation.
An image offloading frequency orchestrator, coordinating with the LEAF, is
developed to adaptively regulate the edge-based object detection invocations
and to further improve the energy efficiency of MAR devices. Extensive
evaluations are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed
analytical model and algorithms.

intelligence (AI) approaches combined with biomedical science play a
significant role in reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and
physicians. The rapid increment in cases of COVID-19 has led to an increase in
demand for hospital beds and other medical equipment. However, since medical
facilities are limited, it is recommended to diagnose patients as per the
severity of the infection. Keeping this in mind, we share our research in
detecting COVID-19 as well as assessing its severity using chest-CT scans and
Deep Learning pre-trained models. Dataset: We have collected a total of 1966 CT
Scan images for three different class labels, namely, Non-COVID, Severe COVID,
and Non-Severe COVID, out of which 714 CT images belong to the Non-COVID
category, 713 CT images are for Non-Severe COVID category and 539 CT images are
of Severe COVID category. Methods: All of the images are initially
pre-processed using the Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
approach. The pre-processed images are then fed into the VGG-16 network for
extracting features. Finally, the retrieved characteristics are categorized and
the accuracy is evaluated using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold
cross-validation (CV). Result and Conclusion: In our study, we have combined
well-known strategies for pre-processing, feature extraction, and
classification which brings us to a remarkable success rate of disease and its
severity recognition with an accuracy of 96.05% (97.7% for Non-Severe COVID-19
images and 93% for Severe COVID-19 images). Our model can therefore help
radiologists detect COVID-19 and the extent of its severity.

prevalence of power law in nature. In this case, the performance of deep
learning models is often dominated by the head classes while the learning of
the tail classes is severely underdeveloped. In order to learn adequately for
all classes, many researchers have studied and preliminarily addressed the
long-tailed problem. In this survey, we focus on the problems caused by
long-tailed data distribution, sort out the representative long-tailed visual
recognition datasets and summarize some mainstream long-tailed studies.
Specifically, we summarize these studies into ten categories from the

limitations of each category. Besides, we have studied four quantitative
metrics for evaluating the imbalance, and suggest using the Gini coefficient to
evaluate the long-tailedness of a dataset. Based on the Gini coefficient, we
quantitatively study 20 widely-used and large-scale visual datasets proposed in

disagreement with the locally measured value. This inconsistency is called the
Hubble tension and is vastly studied in recent years. Early Dark Energy (EDE)
gives a few percent contribution to the total energy density of the universe
only at an epoch before the recombination, and it is considered as a promising
solution to the tension. A simple realization of EDE is given by dynamics of a
scalar field, called the EDE scalar, and models including the EDE scalar are
extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we present a novel EDE
scenario based on higher-dimensional gauge theories. An extra component of
gauge fields associated with a compact extra dimension behaves as the EDE
scalar at low-energy and has a periodic potential, which has a similar form as
potentials for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons (PNGB). In a five-dimensional U(1)
gauge theory, we show that a scalar field that originates from the gauge field
can give EDE through its dynamics in a PNGB type potential with a suitable
choice of parameters in the theory. We focus on the scenario where EDE is
explained by the scalar field and clarify constraints on the fundamental
parameters of the gauge theory, such as the gauge coupling, the
compactification scale, and the mass parameters for matter fields. We also find
that a sufficient dilution of EDE requires non-trivial relations among U(1)
charges of matter fields. With specific matter contents, we numerically solve
the time evolution of the scalar field and confirm that its energy density
behaves as an EDE. In our scenario, the parameters of the gauge theory and
predicted properties of EDE are related to each other. Thus, the cosmological
restrictions on the EDE properties provide insights into higher-dimensional
gauge theories.

outputs when they are present in a document. In this paper, we present the
first theoretical analysis of Anchors, considering that the search for the best
anchor is exhaustive. After formalizing the algorithm for text classification,
we present explicit results on different classes of models when the
vectorization step is TF-IDF, and words are replaced by a fixed
out-of-dictionary token when removed. Our inquiry covers models such as
elementary if-then rules and linear classifiers. We then leverage this analysis
to gain insights on the behavior of Anchors for any differentiable classifiers.
For neural networks, we empirically show that the words corresponding to the
highest partial derivatives of the model with respect to the input, reweighted
by the inverse document frequencies, are selected by Anchors.

the following three points of item cold-start: 1) How to conduct cold-start

compatibility on various backbones, no extra requirements for data, utilization
of both historical data and recent emerging interactions. CVAR uses latent
variables to learn a distribution over item side information and generates
desirable item ID embeddings using a conditional decoder. The proposed method
is evaluated by extensive offline experiments on public datasets and online A/B

optimization methods has attracted significant attention recently in learning
theory. However, most existing trajectory-based analyses require either
restrictive assumptions on the learning rate (e.g., fast decreasing learning
rate), or continuous injected noise (such as the Gaussian noise in Langevin
dynamics). In this paper, we introduce a new discrete data-dependent prior to
the PAC-Bayesian framework, and prove a high probability generalization bound
of order $O(\frac{1}{n}\cdot
\sum_{t=1}^T(\gamma_t/\varepsilon_t)^2\left\|{\mathbf{g}_t}\right\|^2)$ for
Floored GD (i.e. a version of gradient descent with precision level
$\varepsilon_t$), where $n$ is the number of training samples, $\gamma_t$ is
the learning rate at step $t$, $\mathbf{g}_t$ is roughly the difference of the
gradient computed using all samples and that using only prior samples.
$\left\|{\mathbf{g}_t}\right\|$ is upper bounded by and and typical much
smaller than the gradient norm $\left\|{\nabla f(W_t)}\right\|$. We remark that
our bound holds for nonconvex and nonsmooth scenarios. Moreover, our
theoretical results provide numerically favorable upper bounds of testing
errors (e.g., $0.037$ on MNIST). Using a similar technique, we can also obtain
new generalization bounds for certain variants of SGD. Furthermore, we study
the generalization bounds for gradient Langevin Dynamics (GLD). Using the same
framework with a carefully constructed continuous prior, we show a new high
probability generalization bound of order $O(\frac{1}{n} +
\frac{L^2}{n^2}\sum_{t=1}^T(\gamma_t/\sigma_t)^2)$ for GLD. The new $1/n^2$

required energy for breaking hydrogen bonds between Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)

volume phase transition temperature (VPTT=$$32^\circ C$$). Ultrasonic waves
propagate through the solution and their energy will be absorbed due to the
liquid viscosity. The absorbed energy partially leads to the generation of a
streaming flow and the rest will be spent to break the hydrogen bonds.
Therefore, the microgels collapse and become insoluble in the water and
agglomerate, resulting in turbidity. We used turbidity to quantify the
ultrasound energy absorption and showed that the acousto-response of PNIPAM
microgels is a temporal phenomenon that depends on the duration of the
actuation. Increasing the solution concentration leads to a faster hydrogen
bond breakage and turbidity evolution. Furthermore, the frequency of imposed
waves is important and affects the stimulation kinetics of PNIPAM microgels.
Increasing the frequency of actuation increases the speed of hydrogen bond
breakage and thus turbidity evolution. This is due to the increase in
ultrasound energy absorption by liquids at higher frequencies.

in terms of location privacy and tracking threats, to name a few. Indeed, by
simply eavesdropping on the wireless channel, an adversary could know the
precise location of the UAV and track it, as well as obtaining sensitive
information on path source and destination of the UAV. In this paper, we
investigate the trade-off between location privacy and data utility that can be
provided to UAVs when obfuscating the broadcasted location through differential
privacy techniques. Leveraging the concept of Geo-Indistinguishability
(Geo-Ind), already adopted in the context of Location-Based Services (LBS), we
show that it is possible to enhance the privacy of the UAVs without preventing
CI operators to timely detect unauthorized invasions. In particular, our
experiments showed that when the location of an UAV is obfuscated with an
average distance of 1.959 km, a carefully designed UAV detection system can
detect 97.9% of invasions, with an average detection delay of 303.97 msec. The
UAVs have to trade-off such enhanced location privacy with a non-negligible
probability of false positives, i.e., being detected as invading while not
really invading the no-fly zone. UAVs and CI operators can solve such ambiguous
situations later on through the help of the FAA, being this latter the only one
that can unveil the actual location of the UAV.

applications in engineering and science. With the deepening of Thermodynamic
Non-Equilibrium (TNE), higher-order non-conserved kinetic moments of the
distribution function are needed to capture the main feature of the flow state
and evolution process. Based on the ellipsoidal statistical
Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model, Discrete Boltzmann Models (DBMs) that consider
various orders (from the first up to the sixth order) of TNE effects are
developed to study flows in various depths of TNE. Specifically, at first, two
types of one-dimensional Riemann problems and a Couette flow are used to show
the model's capability to capture large flow structures with zero-order and
first-order TNE effects, respectively. Then, a shock wave structure given by
Direct simulation Monte Carlo is used to verify the model's capability to
capture fine structures at the level of mean free path of molecules. Further,
we focus on the TNE degree of two colliding fluids. A five-component vector
$\mathbf{S}_{TNE} = (\tau, \Delta \mathbf{u}, \Delta T,
\bm{\Delta_{2}^{*}},\bm{\Delta_{3,1}^{*}})$ is introduced to roughly
characterize the TNE degree. It is found that the TNE strengths obtained from
various perspectives are different. These findings demonstrate that the
inadequacy of focusing only on the few kinetic moments appearing in
Navier-Stokes increases with the degree of discreteness and deviation from
thermodynamic equilibrium. Finally, a two-dimensional free jet is simulated to
indicate that, to obtain satisfying hydrodynamic quantities, the DBM should
include at least up to the third-order TNE effects.

histories (SFHs). From the 5D {\it Gaia} EDR3 dataset, we extracted local
samples of stars dominated by the Helmi streams, the Galactic (thick and thin)
disc, and the local retrograde halo. We did this by identifying regions in a
pseudo-Cartesian velocity space (obtained by setting line-of-sight velocities
to zero), where stars belonging to these components, as identified in samples
with 6D phase-space information, are predominantly found. We made use of an
updated absolute colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting methodology to contrast
the SFHs of these samples to unveil distinct signatures of the past evolution
of a disrupted accreted system: the Helmi streams. To this end, special
attention was given to the correct characterisation of {\it Gaia} completeness
effects and observational errors on the CMD. We further investigated
alternative sample selections to improve the purity of our 5D Helmi stream
catalogues. We find that the progenitor of the Helmi streams experienced an
early star formation that was sustained for longer (until 7--9~Gyr ago) than
for the Milky Way halo (10--11~Gyr ago). As a consequence, half of its stellar
mass was in place $\sim$~0.7~Gyr later. The quenching of star formation in the
Helmi stream progenitor $\sim$~8~Gyr ago suggests it was accreted by the Milky
Way around this time, in concert with previous estimates based on the dynamics
of the streams.

nonlinear optical (NLO) interactions. The NLO phase shift in materials
exhibiting an ENZ condition is extremely large, however, direct experimental
measurements of the magnitude and time dynamics of this phenomenon,
particularly nondegenerate NLO phase shifts, have so far been lacking. Here, we
directly measure the NLO phase shift of an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) thin film
using three different techniques. By characterizing the excitation-induced,
time resolved Beam Deflection (BD) of a probe beam, we measure the
nondegenerate NLO effects, allowing a separate determination of the effects of
excitation and probe wavelengths on the NLO phase shift as they are varied
across the ENZ region. These experiments reveal that having the probe pulse
centered at ENZ greatly contributes to this enhancement; however, the NLO phase
shift is less sensitive to the excitation wavelength, which only slightly
enhances the nonlinearity for obliquely incident TM-polarized light. We also
find that the spectral shift of the probe pulse induced by the excitation
follows both the magnitude and time dynamics of the NLO phase shift measured
via the BD experiments. We observe large, ultrafast cross-phase modulation in
agreement with a redistribution of carriers in the conduction band. Finally
using the Z-Scan method, we measure the degenerate nonlinear refraction at ENZ
near normal incidence. The results of all three measurements agree, revealing a
gigantic sub-picosecond NLO phase shift in ITO. At its largest, we consistently
measure an effective induced index change that is greater than the linear
index.

excellent models for its functional analogue in the brain, the ventral stream
in visual cortex. This has prompted questions on what, if any, are the common
principles underlying the reformatting of visual information as it flows
through a CNN or the ventral stream. Here we consider some prominent
statistical patterns that are known to exist in the internal representations of
either CNNs or the visual cortex and look for them in the other system. We show
that intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of object representations along the rat
homologue of the ventral stream presents two distinct expansion-contraction
phases, as previously shown for CNNs. Conversely, in CNNs, we show that
training results in both distillation and active pruning (mirroring the
increase in ID) of low- to middle-level image information in single units, as
representations gain the ability to support invariant discrimination, in
agreement with previous observations in rat visual cortex. Taken together, our
findings suggest that CNNs and visual cortex share a similarly tight
relationship between dimensionality expansion/reduction of object
representations and reformatting of image information.

systems. However, in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, there
commonly exists noncontrollable dynamics independent of the action signals,
making it difficult to learn effective world models. To tackle this problem, we
present a novel reinforcement learning approach named Iso-Dream, which improves
the Dream-to-Control framework in two aspects. First, by optimizing the inverse
dynamics, we encourage the world model to learn controllable and
noncontrollable sources of spatiotemporal changes on isolated state transition
branches. Second, we optimize the behavior of the agent on the decoupled latent
imaginations of the world model. Specifically, to estimate state values, we
roll-out the noncontrollable states into the future and associate them with the
current controllable state. In this way, the isolation of dynamics sources can
greatly benefit long-horizon decision-making of the agent, such as a
self-driving car that can avoid potential risks by anticipating the movement of
other vehicles. Experiments show that Iso-Dream is effective in decoupling the
mixed dynamics and remarkably outperforms existing approaches in a wide range
of visual control and prediction domains.

EXchange (EPEX) spot markets in a distinct hourly pattern. This work proposes a

considering the four 15 min intervals in each day-ahead price interval as a
four-dimensional joint probability distribution. The resulting nontrivial,
multivariate price difference distribution is learned using a normalizing flow,
i.e., a deep generative model that combines conditional multivariate density
estimation and probabilistic regression. Furthermore, this work discusses the
influence of different external impact factors based on literature insights and
impact analysis using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The
normalizing flow is compared to an informed selection of historical data and
probabilistic forecasts using a Gaussian copula and a Gaussian regression
model. Among the different models, the normalizing flow identifies the trends
with the highest accuracy and has the narrowest prediction intervals. Both the
XAI analysis and the empirical experiments highlight that the immediate history

|\alpha_k^*x_0|^2+\eta_k$, or noisy generalized phase retrieval (NGPR)
formulated as $y_k = x_0^*A_kx_0 + \eta_k$, where $x_0\in\mathbb{K}^d$ is the
desired signal, $n$ is the sample size, $\eta= (\eta_1,...,\eta_n)^\top$ is the
noise vector. We establish new error bounds under different noise patterns, and
our proofs are valid for both $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ and
$\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$. In NPR under arbitrary noise vector $\eta$, we derive
a new error bound $O\big(\|\eta\|_\infty\sqrt{\frac{d}{n}} +
\frac{|\mathbf{1}^\top\eta|}{n}\big)$, which is tighter than the currently
known one $O\big(\frac{\|\eta\|}{\sqrt{n}}\big)$ in many cases. In NGPR, we
show $O\big(\|\eta\|\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n}\big)$ for arbitrary $\eta$. In both
problems, the bounds for arbitrary noise immediately give rise to
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{d}{n}})$ for sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential random
noise, with some conventional but inessential assumptions (e.g., independent or
zero-mean condition) removed or weakened. In addition, we make a first attempt
to ERM under heavy-tailed random noise assumed to have bounded $l$-th moment.
To achieve a trade-off between bias and variance, we truncate the responses and
propose a corresponding robust ERM estimator, which is shown to possess the
guarantee $\tilde{O}\big(\big[\sqrt{\frac{d}{n}}\big]^{1-1/l}\big)$ in both
NPR, NGPR. All the error bounds straightforwardly extend to the more general
problems of rank-$r$ matrix recovery, and these results deliver a conclusion
that the full-rank frame $\{A_k\}_{k=1}^n$ in NGPR is more robust to biased
noise than the rank-1 frame $\{\alpha_k\alpha_k^*\}_{k=1}^n$ in NPR. Extensive
experimental results are presented to illustrate our theoretical findings.

has several benefits over the existing centralised strategies. For that, a new
structure for the control is proposed in terms of an inner and outer loops for
each generator. The individual generators of a particular zone participate in
the secondary voltage control by aligning their reactive powers with respect to
the pilot point voltage reference. The decentralised nature of the proposed
control strategy enables plug and play operation: run with different numbers of
generators without any need of regulators reconfiguration, resilience in case
of generator failure. This allows one to use such control to integrate
renewable generators to existing secondary regulations alongside with the
classic generators. The proposed control strategy is implemented using a
model-free control scheme that does not require a higher order complex model of
the power grid. The deployment of a discrete-time intelligent proportional
controller simplifies the tuning of the controller gains. The proposed strategy
is validated on a four generator power system model in MATLAB/
Simulink/Simelectrical environment. Simulation results are presented to show
the effectiveness of the proposed strategy along with different case studies
such as load perturbation, transmission line perturbation, generator
disconnection and delay in pilot point voltage measurement to highlight its
robustness.

decision processes (POMDP). Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are used to empower
self-improving agents, which are capable of tackling the challenges of a highly
non-stationary environment. To compare algorithms between each other, the
accuracy between bid and trick count is monitored, which strongly correlates
with the actual rewards and provides a well-defined upper and lower performance
bound. The trained DQN agents achieve accuracies between 66% and 87% in
self-play, leaving behind both a random baseline and a rule-based heuristic.
The conducted analysis also reveals a strong information asymmetry concerning
player positions during bidding. To overcome the missing Markov property of
imperfect-information games, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is
implemented to integrate historic information into the decision-making process.
Additionally, a forward-directed tree search is conducted by sampling a state
of the environment and thereby turning the game into a perfect information
setting. To our surprise, both approaches do not surpass the performance of the
basic DQN agent.

spatio-temporal fetal US feature extraction and standard plane detection
algorithm (called FUVAI) and evaluated the method on 50 freehand fetal US video
scans. We compared FUVAI fetal biometric measurements with measurements made by
five experienced sonographers at two time points separated by at least two
weeks. Intra- and inter-observer variabilities were estimated. Main results. We
found that automated fetal biometric measurements obtained by FUVAI were
comparable to the measurements performed by experienced sonographers The
observed differences in measurement values were within the range of inter- and
intra-observer variability. Moreover, analysis has shown that these differences
were not statistically significant when comparing any individual medical expert
to our model. Significance. We argue that FUVAI has the potential to assist
sonographers who perform fetal biometric measurements in clinical settings by
providing them with suggestions regarding the best measuring frames, along with
automated measurements. Moreover, FUVAI is able perform these tasks in just a
few seconds, which is a huge difference compared to the average of six minutes
taken by sonographers. This is significant, given the shortage of medical
experts capable of interpreting fetal ultrasound images in numerous countries.

potential in multi-intersections traffic signal control, where multiple agents,
one for each intersection, must cooperate together to optimize traffic flow. To
encourage global cooperation, previous work partitions the traffic network into
several regions and learns policies for agents in a feudal structure. However,
static network partition fails to adapt to dynamic traffic flow, which will
changes frequently over time. To address this, we propose a novel feudal MARL
approach with adaptive network partition. Specifically, we first partition the
network into several regions according to the traffic flow. To do this, we
propose two approaches: one is directly to use graph neural network (GNN) to
generate the network partition, and the other is to use Monte-Carlo tree search
(MCTS) to find the best partition with criteria computed by GNN. Then, we
design a variant of Qmix using GNN to handle various dimensions of input, given
by the dynamic network partition. Finally, we use a feudal hierarchy to manage
agents in each partition and promote global cooperation. By doing so, agents
are able to adapt to the traffic flow as required in practice. We empirically
evaluate our method both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic
networks of three cities, widely used in the literature. Our experimental
results confirm that our method can achieve better performance, in terms of
average travel time and queue length, than several leading methods for traffic
signal control.

embedded devices, due to their hardware friendly operation and high accuracy on
practically relevant tasks. The accuracy of a RF often increases with the
number of internal weak learners (decision trees), but at the cost of a
proportional increase in inference latency and energy consumption. Such costs
can be mitigated considering that, in most applications, inputs are not all
equally difficult to classify. Therefore, a large RF is often necessary only
for (few) hard inputs, and wasteful for easier ones. In this work, we propose
an early-stopping mechanism for RFs, which terminates the inference as soon as
a high-enough classification confidence is reached, reducing the number of weak
learners executed for easy inputs. The early-stopping confidence threshold can
be controlled at runtime, in order to favor either energy saving or accuracy.
We apply our method to three different embedded classification tasks, on a

single-component network-forming liquids (e.g., water, silica, silicon) has
elicited considerable scientific interest. The challenge, both for experiments
and simulations, is that the liquid-liquid phase transition occurs under deeply
supercooled conditions, where crystallization occurs very rapidly. Thus, early
evidence from numerical equation of state studies was challenged, with the
argument that slow spontaneous crystallization had been misinterpreted as
evidence of a second liquid state. Rigorous free energy calculations have
subsequently confirmed the existence of a liquid-liquid phase transition in
some models of water, and exciting new experimental evidence has since
supported these computational results. Similar results have so far not been
found for silicon. Here, we present results from free energy calculations

approaches by fixing some of their known problems, including hypersphere

algorithm for the semi-relaxed optimal transport (SROT) problem, which relaxes
one marginal constraint of the standard OT problem. For evaluation of how the
constraint relaxation affects the algorithm behavior and solution, it is
vitally necessary to present the theoretical convergence analysis in terms not
only of the functional value gap, but also of the marginal constraint gap as
well as the OT distance gap. However, no existing work has addressed all
analyses simultaneously. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive
convergence analysis for SR-Sinkhorn. After presenting the
$\epsilon$-approximation of the functional value gap based on a new proof
strategy and exploiting this proof strategy, we give the upper bound of the
marginal constraint gap. We also provide its convergence to the
$\epsilon$-approximation when two distributions are in the probability simplex.
Furthermore, the convergence analysis of the OT distance gap to the
$\epsilon$-approximation is given as assisted by the obtained marginal
constraint gap. The latter two theoretical results are the first results
presented in the literature related to the SROT problem.

However, it is challenging to fairly estimate the performance of various SR

quality. Existing metrics concentrate on the specific kind of degradation
without distinguishing the visual sensitive areas, which have no ability to
describe the diverse SR degeneration situations in both low-level textural and
high-level perceptual information. In this paper, we focus on the textural and
perceptual degradation of SR images, and design a dual stream network to
jointly explore the textural and perceptual information for quality assessment,
dubbed TPNet. By mimicking the human vision system (HVS) that pays more
attention to the significant image areas, we develop the spatial attention to
make the visual sensitive information more distinguishable and utilize feature
normalization (F-Norm) to boost the network representation. Experimental
results show the TPNet predicts the visual quality score more accurate than
other methods and demonstrates better consistency with the human's perspective.

variations of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$. Astrophysical tests of the

Here we use ESPRESSO and other contemporary measurements of $\alpha$, together

Bekenstein models and quintessence-type dark energy models, both of which are
parametric extensions of the canonical $\Lambda$CDM model. In both cases,
previously reported constraints are improved by more than a factor of ten. This

dark matter experiment based on arrays of radio-pure NaI(Tl) crystals. The
experiment aims at achieving an ultra-low background rate and its primary goal
is to confirm or refute the results from the DAMA/LIBRA experiment. The SABRE
Proof-of-Principle phase was carried out in 2020-2021 at the Gran Sasso
National Laboratory (LNGS), in Italy. The next phase consists of two full-scale
experiments: SABRE South at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, in
Australia, and SABRE North at LNGS. This paper focuses on SABRE South and
presents a detailed simulation of the detector, which is used to characterise
the background for dark matter searches including DAMA/LIBRA-like modulation.
We estimate an overall background of 0.72 cpd/kg/keV$_{ee}$ in the energy range
1$-$6 keV$_{ee}$ primarily due to radioactive contamination in the crystals.
Given this level of background and considering that the SABRE South has a
target mass of 50 kg, we expect to exclude (confirm) DAMA/LIBRA modulation at
$4~(5)\sigma$ within 2.5 years of data taking.

energy-resolved geometric emittance, source size and spectrum were
simultaneously measured for electrons and positrons generated from a
laser-wakefield accelerated electron beam impacting on a thin high-Z converter.
More than $10^5$ positrons were observed within 5\% of 600 MeV, with a source
size smaller than 100 $\mu$m and sub-micron geometric emittance, in agreement
with numerical modelling. We conclude that the positron emittance was dominated
by the transverse size of the primary electron beam at the converter.
Minimising the drift distance between the electron source and the converter
would allow for the generation of GeV-scale positron beams with micron-scale
source size and normalised emittance of a few microns, using a 150 TW laser
system. It is proposed that beams with these characteristics are suited for
experimental studies of positron acceleration in a plasma wakefield.

precise quantitative modelling. Microtubule and actin filaments are well
characterized, and the associated proteins are often known, as well as their
abundance and the interactions between these elements. Thus, computer
simulations can be used to investigate the collective behavior of the system
precisely, in a way that is complementary to experiments. Cytosim is an Open
Source cytoskeleton simulation suite designed to handle large systems of
flexible filaments with associated proteins such as molecular motors. It also
offers the possibility to simulate passive crosslinkers, diffusible
crosslinkers, nucleators, cutters and discrete versions of the motors that only
step on unoccupied lattice sites on a filament. Other objects complement the
filaments by offering spherical or more complicated geometry that can be used
to represent chromosomes, nucleus or vesicles in the cell. Cytosim offers
simple command-line tools for running a simulation and displaying its results,
that are versatile and do not require programming skills. In this workflow,
step-by-step instructions are given to: i) install the necessary environment on
a new computer, ii) configure Cytosim to simulate the contraction of a 2D
actomyosin network, iii) produce a visual representation of the system. Next,
the system is probed by systematically varying a key parameter: the number of
crosslinkers. Finally, the visual representation of the system is complemented
by a numerical quantification of contractility to view, in a graph, how
contractility depends on the composition of the system. Overall, these
different steps constitute a typical workflow that can be applied with few
modifications, to tackle many other problems in the cytoskeletal field.

the bulk topological properties of the Hamiltonian that describes the coherent

the exchange interactions, we find weakening of the bulk-boundary

and mass gap of the edge states encountered as we vary the lattice constant and
offset between the chains. Most interestingly, we analytically identify
parameter regimes where edge states arise which are fully localized to the
boundaries of the chain, independently of the system size. These edge states
are shown to be not only robust against positional disorder of the atoms in the
chain, but also subradiant, i.e., dynamically stable even in the presence of
inevitable dissipation processes, establishing the capacity of waveguide QED

  Expressive Power","25 pages; to appear in NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well-known that modern neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial
examples. To mitigate this problem, a series of robust learning algorithms have
been proposed. However, although the robust training error can be near zero via
some methods, all existing algorithms lead to a high robust generalization
error. In this paper, we provide a theoretical understanding of this puzzling
phenomenon from the perspective of expressive power for deep neural networks.
Specifically, for binary classification problems with well-separated data, we
show that, for ReLU networks, while mild over-parameterization is sufficient
for high robust training accuracy, there exists a constant robust
generalization gap unless the size of the neural network is exponential in the
data dimension $d$. This result holds even if the data is linear separable
(which means achieving standard generalization is easy), and more generally for
any parameterized function classes as long as their VC dimension is at most
polynomial in the number of parameters. Moreover, we establish an improved
upper bound of $\exp({\mathcal{O}}(k))$ for the network size to achieve low
robust generalization error when the data lies on a manifold with intrinsic
dimension $k$ ($k \ll d$). Nonetheless, we also have a lower bound that grows
exponentially with respect to $k$ -- the curse of dimensionality is inevitable.
By demonstrating an exponential separation between the network size for
achieving low robust training and generalization error, our results reveal that
the hardness of robust generalization may stem from the expressive power of
practical models.

only few for biaxial strain where there is often a trade-off between maximum

observational data is complete. However, the missing data problem is pervasive
in many practical scenarios such as clinical trials, economics, and biology.
One straightforward way to address the missing data problem is first to impute
the data using off-the-shelf imputation methods and then apply existing causal
discovery methods. However, such a two-step method may suffer from
suboptimality, as the imputation algorithm may introduce bias for modeling the
underlying data distribution. In this paper, we develop a general method, which
we call MissDAG, to perform causal discovery from data with incomplete
observations. Focusing mainly on the assumptions of ignorable missingness and
the identifiable additive noise models (ANMs), MissDAG maximizes the expected
likelihood of the visible part of observations under the
expectation-maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, in cases where
computing the posterior distributions of parameters in closed-form is not
feasible, Monte Carlo EM is leveraged to approximate the likelihood. In the
M-step, MissDAG leverages the density transformation to model the noise
distributions with simpler and specific formulations by virtue of the ANMs and
uses a likelihood-based causal discovery algorithm with directed acyclic graph
constraint. We demonstrate the flexibility of MissDAG for incorporating various
causal discovery algorithms and its efficacy through extensive simulations and
real data experiments.

robots are operating on a two-dimensional infinite grid. Robots are initially
positioned on distinct grid points forming an asymmetric configuration (no two
robots have the same snapshot). They operate under a fully asynchronous
scheduler and do not have any access to a global coordinate system, but they
will align the axes of their local coordinate systems along the grid lines. The
previous work dealing with \textsc{Apf} problem solved it in
$O(\mathcal{D}^2k)$ robot movements under similar conditions, where
$\mathcal{D}$ is the side of the smallest square that can contain both initial

This remarkably radio-pure crystal already showed a low background in the SABRE
Proof-of-Principle (PoP) detector, in the low energy region of interest (1-6
keV) for the search of dark matter interaction via the annual modulation
signature. As the vetoable background components, such as $^{40}$K, are here
sub-dominant, we reassembled the PoP setup with a fully passive shielding. We
upgraded the selection of events based on a Boosted Decision Tree algorithm
that rejects most of the PMT-induced noise while retaining scintillation
signals with > 90% effciency in 1-6 keV. We find an average background of 1.39
$\pm$ 0.02 cpd/kg/keV in the region of interest and a spectrum consistent with
data previously acquired in the PoP setup, where the external veto background
suppression was in place. Our background model indicates that the dominant
background component is due to decays of $^{210}$Pb, only partly residing in
the crystal itself. The other location of $^{210}$Pb is the reflector foil that
wraps the crystal. We now proceed to design the experimental setup for the

Surprisingly enough, nondegeneracy of normalized Nash equilibrium does not

shown tremendous promise in the domain of mental health. Prominently, the CAs
have been used to provide informational or therapeutic services to patients.
However, the utility of CAs to assist in mental health triaging has not been
explored in the existing work as it requires a controlled generation of
follow-up questions (FQs), which are often initiated and guided by the mental
health professionals (MHPs) in clinical settings. In the context of depression,
our experiments show that DLMs coupled with process knowledge in a mental
health questionnaire generate 12.54% and 9.37% better FQs based on similarity
and longest common subsequence matches to questions in the PHQ-9 dataset
respectively, when compared with DLMs without process knowledge support.
Despite coupling with process knowledge, we find that DLMs are still prone to
hallucination, i.e., generating redundant, irrelevant, and unsafe FQs. We
demonstrate the challenge of using existing datasets to train a DLM for
generating FQs that adhere to clinical process knowledge. To address this
limitation, we prepared an extended PHQ-9 based dataset, PRIMATE, in
collaboration with MHPs. PRIMATE contains annotations regarding whether a
particular question in the PHQ-9 dataset has already been answered in the
user's initial description of the mental health condition. We used PRIMATE to
train a DLM in a supervised setting to identify which of the PHQ-9 questions
can be answered directly from the user's post and which ones would require more
information from the user. Using performance analysis based on MCC scores, we
show that PRIMATE is appropriate for identifying questions in PHQ-9 that could
guide generative DLMs towards controlled FQ generation suitable for aiding
triaging. Dataset created as a part of this research:

flagged from the previous study. Apparently, these channels are less likely to
be set as ""madeForKids"" than those sharing suitable content. In addition,
channels posting disturbing videos utilize their channel features such as
keywords, description, topics, posts, etc., to appeal to kids (e.g., using
game-related keywords). Finally, we use a collection of such channel and
content features to train ML classifiers able to detect, at channel creation
time, when a channel will be related to disturbing content uploads. These
classifiers can help YouTube moderators reduce such incidences, pointing to

ignoring odd-hop neighbors improves the robustness of GNNs. We conduct

effectiveness of EvenNet. Notably, EvenNet outperforms existing defense models
against structural attacks without introducing additional computational costs
and maintains competitiveness in traditional node classification tasks on

intervalley scattering does not considerably affect the figure of merit near

powerful methods for sampling from the posterior distribution of the latent
states of a dynamic model such as a hidden Markov model. However, the
performance of these methods deteriorates with models involving weakly
informative observations and/or slowly mixing dynamics. Both of these
complications arise when sampling finely time-discretised continuous-time path
integral models, but can occur with hidden Markov models too. Multinomial
resampling, which is commonly employed with CPFs, resamples excessively for
weakly informative observations and thereby introduces extra variance.
Furthermore, slowly mixing dynamics render the backward/ancestor sampling steps
ineffective, leading to degeneracy issues. We detail two conditional resampling
strategies suitable for the weakly informative regime: the so-called `killing'
resampling and the systematic resampling with mean partial order. To avoid the
degeneracy issues, we introduce a generalisation of the CPF with backward
sampling that involves auxiliary `bridging' CPF steps that are parameterised by
a blocking sequence. We present practical tuning strategies for choosing an
appropriate blocking. Our experiments demonstrate that the CPF with a suitable
resampling and the developed `bridge backward sampling' can lead to substantial

alternative to standard neural networks, an artificial sharpening of the
posterior usually needs to be applied to reach comparable performance. This is
in stark contrast to theory, dictating that given an adequate prior and a
well-specified model, the untempered Bayesian posterior should achieve optimal
performance. Despite the community's extensive efforts, the observed gains in
performance still remain disputed with several plausible causes pointing at its
origin. While data augmentation has been empirically recognized as one of the
main drivers of this effect, a theoretical account of its role, on the other
hand, is largely missing. In this work we identify two interlaced factors
concurrently influencing the strength of the cold posterior effect, namely the
correlated nature of augmentations and the degree of invariance of the employed
model to such transformations. By theoretically analyzing simplified settings,
we prove that tempering implicitly reduces the misspecification arising from
modeling augmentations as i.i.d. data. The temperature mimics the role of the
effective sample size, reflecting the gain in information provided by the
augmentations. We corroborate our theoretical findings with extensive empirical
evaluations, scaling to realistic BNNs. By relying on the framework of group
convolutions, we experiment with models of varying inherent degree of

Optimisation (BO) has focused on adapting deep probabilistic models as flexible
alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs). In a similar vein, this paper
investigates the feasibility of employing state-of-the-art probabilistic
transformers in BO. Upon further investigation, we observe two drawbacks
stemming from their training procedure and loss definition, hindering their
direct deployment as proxies in black-box optimisation. First, we notice that
these models are trained on uniformly distributed inputs, which impairs
predictive accuracy on non-uniform data - a setting arising from any typical BO
loop due to exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Second, we realise that
training losses (e.g., cross-entropy) only asymptotically guarantee accurate
posterior approximations, i.e., after arriving at the global optimum, which
generally cannot be ensured. At the stationary points of the loss function,
however, we observe a degradation in predictive performance especially in
exploratory regions of the input space. To tackle these shortcomings we
introduce two components: 1) a BO-tailored training prior supporting
non-uniformly distributed points, and 2) a novel approximate posterior
regulariser trading-off accuracy and input sensitivity to filter favourable
stationary points for improved predictive performance. In a large panel of
experiments, we demonstrate, for the first time, that one transformer
pre-trained on data sampled from random GP priors produces competitive results
on 16 benchmark black-boxes compared to GP-based BO. Since our model is only
pre-trained once and used in all tasks without any retraining and/or

devices and are fragile against quantum noise effects, namely, NISQ devices.
Traditional quantum-error-correcting codes are not implemented on such devices
and to perform quantum computation in good accuracy with these machines we need
to develop alternative approaches for mitigating quantum computational errors.
In this work, we propose quantum error mitigation (QEM) scheme for quantum
computational errors which occur due to couplings with environments during gate
operations, i.e., decoherence. To establish our QEM scheme, first we estimate
the quantum noise effects on single-qubit states and represent them as groups
of quantum circuits, namely, quantum-noise-effect circuit groups. Then our QEM
scheme is conducted by subtracting expectation values generated by the
quantum-noise-effect circuit groups from that obtained by the quantum circuits
for the quantum algorithms under consideration. As a result, the quantum noise
effects are reduced, and we obtain approximately the ideal expectation values
via the quantum-noise-effect circuit groups and the numbers of elementary
quantum circuits composing them scale polynomial with respect to the products
of the depths of quantum algorithms and the numbers of register bits. To
numerically demonstrate the validity of our QEM scheme, we run noisy quantum
simulations of qubits under the amplitude damping effects for four types of
quantum algorithms. Our QEM scheme is solely composed of quantum-computational
operations (quantum gates and measurements), and thus, it can be conducted by
any type of quantum device. In addition, it can be applied to error mitigation
for many other types of quantum noise effects as well as noisy quantum
computing of long-depth quantum algorithms.

likelihood. The Mallows model has been proven to be useful for recommender
systems where it can be used to learn personal preferences from highly
incomplete data provided by the users. Inference based on MCMC is however slow,
preventing its use in real time applications. The Pseudo-Mallows distribution
is a product of univariate discrete Mallows-like distributions, constrained to
remain in the space of permutations. The quality of the approximation depends
on the order of the $n$ items used to determine the factorization sequence. In
a variational setting, we optimise the variational order parameter by
minimising a marginalized KL-divergence. We propose an approximate algorithm
for this discrete optimization, and conjecture a certain form of the optimal
variational order that depends on the data. Empirical evidence and some theory
support our conjecture. Sampling from the Pseudo-Mallows distribution allows
fast preference learning, compared to alternative MCMC based options, when the
data exists in form of partial rankings of the items or of clicking on some
items. Through simulations and a real life data case study, we demonstrate that
the Pseudo-Mallows model learns personal preferences very well and makes
recommendations much more efficiently, while maintaining similar accuracy
compared to the exact Bayesian Mallows model.

develop a brand-new DG variant, namely Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), in
which the model learns to twist the network parameters to adapt the data from
different domains. Specifically, we leverage a meta-adjuster to twist the
network parameters based on the static model with respect to different data

domain-shared features, while the meta-adjuster is designed to learn
domain-specific features. To enable this process, DomainMix is exploited to
simulate data from diverse domains during teaching the meta-adjuster to adapt
to the upcoming agnostic target domains. This learning mechanism urges the
model to generalize to different agnostic target domains via adjusting the

Finally, we compare the NUV characteristics of these families with (162173)

the use of the five commonly used stars in Landolt's catalog as solar analogs
to obtain the asteroid reflectance in the NUV wavelength range. We compare the
spectra of five G-stars in Landolt's catalog with the spectrum of the
well-studied solar analog Hyades 64, also observed on the same nights. Results.
We find that many widely used Landolt's G-type stars are not solar analogs in
the NUV wavelength spectral region and thus are not suitable for obtaining the
reflectance spectra of asteroids. We also find that, even though the Themis
family and the Polana-Eulalia family complex show a similar blueness at visible
wavelengths, the NUV absorption of the Themis family is much deeper than that
of the Polana-Eulalia family complex. We did not find significant differences

creates accurate pseudo-labels based on shared prototypes. Jointly with labeled

localization problem). In this paper, we empirically prove that this problem is
associated with the mixup of the activation values between less discriminative
foreground regions and the background. To address it, we propose Class
RE-Activation Mapping (CREAM), a novel clustering-based approach to boost the
activation values of the integral object regions. To this end, we introduce
class-specific foreground and background context embeddings as cluster
centroids. A CAM-guided momentum preservation strategy is developed to learn
the context embeddings during training. At the inference stage, the
re-activation mapping is formulated as a parameter estimation problem under
Gaussian Mixture Model, which can be solved by deriving an unsupervised
Expectation-Maximization based soft-clustering algorithm. By simply integrating
CREAM into various WSOL approaches, our method significantly improves their
performance. CREAM achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUB, ILSVRC and
OpenImages benchmark datasets. Code will be available at

explored the dynamics of cluster structures and constructed a fitness-based

a cluster and the shift of a cluster centre, as well as inter-cluster dynamics
represented by clusters' relative frequencies, often exhibit notable dynamical
modes that hold across the cultures and different musical aspects.
Additionally, we found that the evolutionary model incorporating these

Focussing on the
classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework, the current work quantifies the
performance of bandit algorithms by applying a fundamental welfare function,
namely the Nash social welfare (NSW) function. This corresponds to equating
algorithm's performance to the geometric mean of its expected rewards and leads
us to the study of Nash regret, defined as the difference between the -- a
priori unknown -- optimal mean (among the arms) and the algorithm's
performance. Since NSW is known to satisfy fairness axioms, our approach
complements the utilitarian considerations of average (cumulative) regret,
wherein the algorithm is evaluated via the arithmetic mean of its expected
rewards.
  This work develops an algorithm that, given the horizon of play $T$, achieves
a Nash regret of $O \left( \sqrt{\frac{{k \log T}}{T}} \right)$, here $k$
denotes the number of arms in the MAB instance. Since, for any algorithm, the
Nash regret is at least as much as its average regret (the AM-GM inequality),
the known lower bound on average regret holds for Nash regret as well.
Therefore, our Nash regret guarantee is essentially tight. In addition, we
develop an anytime algorithm with a Nash regret guarantee of $O \left(
\sqrt{\frac{{k\log T}}{T}} \log T \right)$.

shown impressive success across numerous downstream vision tasks with Vision
transformers. Its underlying idea is simple: a portion of the input image is
masked out and then reconstructed via a pre-text task. However, the working
principle behind MIM is not well explained, and previous studies insist that
MIM primarily works for the Transformer family but is incompatible with CNNs.
In this work, we observe that MIM essentially teaches the model to learn better
middle-order interactions among patches for more generalized feature
extraction. We then propose an Architecture-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling
framework (A$^2$MIM), which is compatible with both Transformers and CNNs in a
unified way. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that A$^2$MIM
learns better representations without explicit design and endows the backbone
model with the stronger capability to transfer to various downstream tasks.

allocation technique for the multi-agent environment presented by a cognitive
radio network where the interactions of the agents during learning may lead to
a non-stationary environment. The resource allocation technique presented in
this work is distributed, not requiring coordination with other agents. It is
shown by considering aspects specific to deep reinforcement learning that the
presented algorithm converges in an arbitrarily long time to equilibrium
policies in a non-stationary multi-agent environment that results from the
uncoordinated dynamic interaction between radios through the shared wireless
environment. Simulation results show that the presented technique achieves a
faster learning performance compared to an equivalent table-based Q-learning
algorithm and is able to find the optimal policy in 99% of cases for a
sufficiently long learning time. In addition, simulations show that our DQL
approach requires less than half the number of learning steps to achieve the
same performance as an equivalent table-based implementation. Moreover, it is
shown that the use of a standard single-agent deep reinforcement learning

complexity posts a great challenge to the GUI implementation. According to our
pilot study of crowdtesting bug reports, display issues such as text overlap,
component occlusion, missing image always occur during GUI rendering on
different devices due to the software or hardware compatibility. They
negatively influence the app usability, resulting in poor user experience. To
detect these issues, we propose a fully automated approach, Nighthawk, based on
deep learning for modelling visual information of the GUI screenshot. Nighthawk
can detect GUIs with display issues and also locate the detailed region of the
issue in the given GUI for guiding developers to fix the bug. At the same time,
training the model needs a large amount of labeled buggy screenshots, which
requires considerable manual effort to prepare them. We therefore propose a

the labeled training data. The evaluation demonstrates that our Nighthawk can
achieve average 0.84 precision and 0.84 recall in detecting UI display issues,
average 0.59 AP and 0.60 AR in localizing these issues. We also evaluate
Nighthawk with popular Android apps on Google Play and F-Droid, and
successfully uncover 151 previously-undetected UI display issues with 75 of

such as traffic flow, taxi demand and air quality forecasting. Due to the high
cost of data collection, some developing cities have few available data, which
makes it infeasible to train a well-performed model. To address this challenge,
cross-city knowledge transfer has shown its promise, where the model learned
from data-sufficient cities is leveraged to benefit the learning process of
data-scarce cities. However, the spatio-temporal graphs among different cities
show irregular structures and varied features, which limits the feasibility of
existing Few-Shot Learning (\emph{FSL}) methods. Therefore, we propose a
model-agnostic few-shot learning framework for spatio-temporal graph called
ST-GFSL. Specifically, to enhance feature extraction by transfering cross-city
knowledge, ST-GFSL proposes to generate non-shared parameters based on
node-level meta knowledge. The nodes in target city transfer the knowledge via
parameter matching, retrieving from similar spatio-temporal characteristics.
Furthermore, we propose to reconstruct the graph structure during
meta-learning. The graph reconstruction loss is defined to guide
structure-aware learning, avoiding structure deviation among different
datasets. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four traffic speed prediction
benchmarks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of ST-GFSL compared
with state-of-the-art methods.

elegant way to handle combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However,
limited by expertise and resources, most users do not have enough capability to
implement EAs to solve COPs. An intuitive and promising solution is to
outsource evolutionary operations to a cloud server, whilst it suffers from
privacy concerns. To this end, this paper proposes a novel computing paradigm,
evolution as a service (EaaS), where a cloud server renders evolutionary
computation services for users without sacrificing users' privacy. Inspired by
the idea of EaaS, this paper designs PEGA, a novel privacy-preserving GA for
COPs. Specifically, PEGA enables users outsourcing COPs to the cloud server
holding a competitive GA and approximating the optimal solution in a
privacy-preserving manner. PEGA features the following characteristics. First,
any user without expertise and enough resources can solve her COPs. Second,
PEGA does not leak contents of optimization problems, i.e., users' privacy.
Third, PEGA has the same capability as the conventional GA to approximate the
optimal solution. We implements PEGA falling in a twin-server architecture and
evaluates it in the traveling salesman problem (TSP, a widely known COP).
Particularly, we utilize encryption cryptography to protect users' privacy and
carefully design a suit of secure computing protocols to support evolutionary
operators of GA on encrypted data. Privacy analysis demonstrates that PEGA does
not disclose the contents of the COP to the cloud server. Experimental
evaluation results on four TSP datasets show that PEGA is as effective as the
conventional GA in approximating the optimal solution.

i.e. at zero temperature this is the $2\frac12$ order phase transition. Since
transitions of this kind in a normal metal are always associated to certain
topological changes, then below we clarify the topological nature of the
transition under consideration. Namely, we demonstrate that the topological
invariant which in process of the transition undergoes the change is nothing
but the Euler characteristic. Alternatively, in terms of the theory of
catastrophes one can relate this transition to appearance of the cuspidal edge
at the corresponding surface of the density of states as the function of energy
and superconducting order parameter. The concept of experiments for the
confirmation of $2\frac12$ order topological phase transition is proposed.
Obtained theoretical results can be applied for the explanation of recent

approach used to solve this problem is to first construct a finite-state
abstraction of the original system and then synthesise a controller for the
abstract system. For this approach, the robust stutter bisimulation relation is
introduced, which preserves the existence of controllers for any given linear
temporal logic formula. States are related by the robust stutter bisimulation
relation if the same target sets can be guaranteed to be reached or avoided
under control of some controllers, thereby ensuring that disturbances have
similar effect on paths that start in related states. This paper presents an
algorithm to construct the corresponding robust stutter bisimulation quotient
to solve the abstraction problem, and it is shown, by explicit construction,

$\beta$ as the CMB photons have been traveling for more than 13 billion years.
This effect is known as ""cosmic birefringence."" In this paper, we present new
measurements of cosmic birefringence from a joint analysis of polarization data

to the statistical significance of $3.6\sigma$. There is no evidence for
frequency dependence of $\beta$. We find a similar result, albeit with a larger

However, the direct growth of micrometre-long GNRs on insulating substrates,

immense challenge. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of GNRs on an
insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate through
nanoparticle-catalysed chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ultra-narrow GNRs with
lengths of up to 10 {\mu}m are synthesized. Remarkably, the as-grown GNRs are
crystallographically aligned with the h-BN substrate, forming one-dimensional
(1D) moir\'e superlattices. Scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals an average
width of 2 nm and a typical bandgap of ~1 eV for similar GNRs grown on
conducting graphite substrates. Fully atomistic computational simulations
support the experimental results and reveal a competition between the formation
of GNRs and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during the nucleation stage, and van der
Waals sliding of the GNRs on the h-BN substrate throughout the growth stage.
Our study provides a scalable, single-step method for growing micrometre-long

emission, modelled in frequency as a power law and a modified blackbody
respectively. We account for inter-pixel correlations in the noise covariance
matrices of the input maps and introduce a spatial correlation length in the
prior matrices for the spectral indices beta. We apply our method to
low-resolution polarised Planck 2018 Low and High Frequency Instrument

evidence for spatial variation of the synchrotron spectral index, and no
evidence for depolarisation of dust. Using the HFI SRoll2 maps, and applying
wide priors on the spectral indices, we find a mean polarised synchrotron
spectral index over the unmasked sky of beta-sync = -2.833 +- 0.620. For
polarised dust emission, we obtain beta-dust = 1.429 +- 0.236. Our method
returns correlated uncertainties for all components of the sky model. Using our
recovered CMB maps and associated uncertainties, we constrain the optical depth
to reionization, tau, using a cross-spectrum-based likelihood-approximation
scheme (momento) to be tau = 0.0598 +- 0.0059. We confirm our findings using a

prove that their statistical mixture models are universal density estimators of
smooth densities in hyperbolic spaces. The Poincar\'e and the hyperboloid

using different models of hyperbolic geometry. Namely, the Poincar\'e
distributions form a triparametric bivariate exponential family whose sample
space is the hyperbolic Poincar\'e upper-half plane and natural parameter space
is the open 3D convex cone of two-by-two positive-definite matrices. The family
of hyperboloid distributions form another exponential family which has sample
space the forward sheet of the two-sheeted unit hyperboloid modeling hyperbolic

Poincar\'e distributions can be expressed using three canonical terms using
Eaton's framework of maximal group invariance. We also show that the
$f$-divergences between any two Poincar\'e distributions are asymmetric except
when those distributions belong to a same leaf of a particular foliation of the

diffusion-mediated absorption at a reactive surface, which takes into account
stochastic switching of a diffusing particle's conformational state. For
simplicity, we consider a two-state model in which the probability of surface
absorption depends on the current particle state and the amount of time the
particle has spent in a neighborhood of the surface in each state. The latter
is determined by a pair of local times $\ell_{n,t}$, $n=0,1$, which are
Brownian functionals that keep track of particle-surface encounters over the
time interval $[0,t]$. We proceed by constructing a differential
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation for a pair of generalized propagators
$P_n(\x,\ell_0,\ell_1,t)$, where $P_n$ is the joint probability density for the
set $(\X_t,\ell_{0,t},\ell_{1,t})$ when $N_t=n$, where $\X_t$ denotes the
particle position and $N_t$ is the corresponding conformational state.
Performing a double Laplace transform with respect to $\ell_0,\ell_1$ yields an
effective system of equations describing diffusion in a bounded domain
$\Omega$, in which there is switching between two Robin boundary conditions on
$\partial \Omega$. The corresponding constant reactivities are $\kappa_j=D
z_j$, $j=0,1$, where $z_j$ is the Laplace variable corresponding to $\ell_j$
and $D$ is the diffusivity. Given the solution for the propagators in Laplace
space, we construct a corresponding probabilistic model for partial absorption,
which requires finding the inverse Laplace transform with respect to $z_0,z_1$.
We illustrate the theory by considering diffusion of a particle on the
half-line with the boundary at $x=0$ effectively switching between a totally
reflecting and a partially absorbing state. Finally, we indicate how to extend
the analysis to higher spatial dimensions using the spectral theory of
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators.

partially absorbing target $\calM$ with position and occupation time resetting.
The occupation time $A_t$ is a Brownian functional that determines the amount
of time that the particle spends in $ \calM$ over the time interval $[0,t]$. We
assume that there exists some internal state $\calU_t$ of the particle at time
$t$ which is modified whenever the particle is diffusing within $\calM $. The
state $\calU_t$ is taken to be a monotonically increasing function of $A_t$,
and absorption occurs as soon as $\calU_t$ crosses some fixed threshold. We
first show how to analyze threshold absorption in terms of the joint
probability density or generalized propagator $P(\x,a,t|\x_0)$ for the pair
$(\X_t,A_t)$ in the case of a non-absorbing substrate $\calM$, where $\X_t$ is
the particle position at time $t$ and $\x_0$ is the initial position. We then
introduce a generalized stochastic resetting protocol in which both the
position $\X_t$ and the internal state $\calU_t$ are reset to their initial
values, $\X_t\rightarrow \x_0$ and $\calU_t\rightarrow 0$, at a Poisson rate
$r$. The latter is mathematically equivalent to resetting the occupation time,
$A_t\rightarrow 0$. Since resetting is governed by a renewal process, the
survival probability with resetting can be expressed in terms of the survival
probability without resetting, which means that the statistics of absorption
can be determined by calculating the double Laplace transform of
$P(\x,a,t|\x_0)$ with respect to $t$ and $a$. In order to develop the basic
theory, we focus on one-dimensional (1D) diffusion with $\calM$ given by a
finite or semi-infinite interval, and explore how the MFPT with resetting
depends on various model parameters. We also compare the threshold mechanism
with the classical case of a constant absorption rate.

detector places a sensor at a single vertex to monitor the system and detect
the presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary selects a
single vertex through which to conduct a cyber-attack that maximally disrupts
the target vertex while remaining undetected by the detector. As our first

given vertex belongs to the set of feasible monitor vertices. The optimal
sensor placement is then determined by computing the mixed-strategy Nash
equilibrium of the zero-sum game through linear programming. The approach is
illustrated via a numerical example of a 10-vertex networked control system
with a given target vertex.

transition (MIPT) in their entanglement structure, but the nature of the

moreover, the dynamical critical exponent $z = \infty$. The MIPT is flanked by
Griffiths phases with continuously varying dynamical exponents. We argue for
this infinite-randomness scenario on general grounds and present numerical

MIPT using large-scale simulations of Clifford circuits. These findings

These capabilities were made possible by installing a custom contact-location

pressure sensor on the thumb. We compared the performance of the two systems
against a standard myoelectric prosthesis and a myoelectric prosthesis with
only autonomous controllers in a difficult reach-to-pick-and-place task

this between-subjects study indicated that vibrotactile feedback combined with
synthetic reflexes proved significantly more advantageous than the standard

noise removal capability necessary to support arbitrary-depth computation. We
propose a generalized version of bootstrapping that can be implemented directly
in our hardware, instantiated with Montgomery multipliers that save 46% in
silicon area and 40% in power consumption compared to traditional approaches.
  BASALISC's four-layer memory hierarchy includes a two-dimensional
conflict-free inner memory layer that enables 32 Tb/s radix-256 NTT
computations without pipeline stalls. Our conflict-resolution permutation
hardware is generalized and re-used to compute BGV automorphisms without

accelerate BGV key switching. Both BASALISC's computation units and inner
memory layers are designed in asynchronous logic, allowing them to run at
different speeds to optimize each function.
  To evaluate BASALISC, we study its physical realizability, emulate and
formally verify its core functional units, and we study its performance on a
set of benchmarks. First, we evaluate a single iteration of logistic regression
training over encrypted data - an application that translates to 513

that BASALISC is only 3,500 times slower than an Intel Xeon-class processor

planets, i.e., the `radius valley', has given us unprecedented insight into the
planet formation process. Here we explore the properties of the radius valley
for low mass stars, assuming that the core-powered mass-loss is the dominant
process shaping the small exoplanet population. We show that the slope of
radius valley in the planet size-orbital period space, to first-order, does not
vary with stellar mass and has a negative slope of $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d
log}P \simeq -0.11$ even for stars as small as 0.1 $M_\odot$, as observed in
latest studies. Furthermore, we find that the slope of the radius valley in the
planet size-stellar mass space is $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast \simeq (3
\zeta - 2)/36$ where $\zeta$ is given by the stellar mass-luminosity relation
$L_\ast \propto M_\ast^\zeta$. Because $\zeta$ is $\gtrsim$ 2 and increases
with stellar mass, we predict that the radius valley has a positive slope in
the planet size-stellar mass space across FGKM dwarfs. This slope, however,
decreases (increases) in magnitude towards lower (higher) mass stars, due to
the variation of $\zeta$ with stellar mass. While around 1.0 $M_\odot$ stars
the slope is $\text{d log}R_p/\text{d log}M_\ast \sim 0.37$, it is as low as
$\sim 0.13$ around 0.1 $M_\odot$ stars. In addition, we find that the radius
valley is narrower and less empty around lower mass stars. Finally, we show
that predictions for the radius valley for core-powered mass-loss and
photoevaporation become increasingly distinct for lower mass stars.

Collision finding is an ubiquitous problem in cryptanalysis, and it has been
well studied using both classical and quantum algorithms. Indeed, the quantum
query complexity of the problem is well known to be $\Theta(2^{m/3})$, and
matching algorithms are known for any value of $m$. The situation becomes
different when one is looking for multiple collision pairs. Here, for $2^k$
collisions, a query lower bound of $\Theta(2^{(2k+m)/3})$ was shown by Liu and
Zhandry (EUROCRYPT~2019). A matching algorithm is known, but only for
relatively small values of $m$, when many collisions exist. In this paper, we
improve the algorithms for this problem and, in particular, extend the range of

allows to extract multiple solutions of an MNRS-style quantum walk, without

incorporating additional information from the bulk may improve inference of the

problems (IVPs). It is based on an optimization (action) functional with
doubled degrees of freedom, which is discretized using a single regularized
summation-by-parts (SBP) operator. Formulated as optimization task it allows us
to obtain classical trajectories without the need to derive an equation of
motion. The novel regularization we develop in this context is inspired by the
weak imposition of initial data, often deployed in the modern treatment of IVPs
and is implemented using affine coordinates. We demonstrate numerically the
stability, accuracy and convergence properties of our approach in systems with
classical equations of motion featuring both first and second order derivatives

  affine invariant model of soft tissue elasticity","12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The elasticity of soft tissues has been widely considered as a characteristic
property to differentiate between healthy and vicious tissues and, therefore,
motivated several elasticity imaging modalities, such as Ultrasound
Elastography, Magnetic Resonance Elastography, and Optical Coherence
Elastography. This paper proposes an alternative approach of modeling the
elasticity using Computed Tomography (CT) imaging modality for model-based
feature extraction machine learning (ML) differentiation of lesions. The model
describes a dynamic non-rigid (or elastic) deformation in differential manifold
to mimic the soft tissues elasticity under wave fluctuation in vivo. Based on
the model, three local deformation invariants are constructed by two tensors
defined by the first and second order derivatives from the CT images and used
to generate elastic feature maps after normalization via a novel signal
suppression method. The model-based elastic image features are extracted from
the feature maps and fed to machine learning to perform lesion classifications.
Two pathologically proven image datasets of colon polyps (44 malignant and 43
benign) and lung nodules (46 malignant and 20 benign) were used to evaluate the
proposed model-based lesion classification. The outcomes of this modeling
approach reached the score of area under the curve of the receiver operating
characteristics of 94.2 % for the polyps and 87.4 % for the nodules, resulting
in an average gain of 5 % to 30 % over ten existing state-of-the-art lesion
classification methods. The gains by modeling tissue elasticity for ML
differentiation of lesions are striking, indicating the great potential of
exploring the modeling strategy to other tissue properties for ML
differentiation of lesions.

neutron stars at cosmological distances, for which around a thousand
electromagnetic follow-ups may be observed per year. So far, most work devoted
to the expected cosmological impact of these standard sirens employed them only
as distance indicators. Only recently their use as tracers of clustering,
similar to what already proposed for supernovae, has been studied. Focusing on
the expected specifications of the Einstein Telescope (ET), we forecast here
the performance on cosmological parameters of future standard sirens as both
distance and density indicators, with emphasis on the linear perturbation
growth index and on spatial curvature. We improve upon previous studies in a
number of ways: a more detailed analysis of available telescope time, the
inclusion of more cosmological and nuisance parameters, the Alcock-Paczynski
correction, the use of sirens also as both velocity and density tracers, and a
more accurate estimation of the distance posterior. We find that the analysis
of the clustering of sirens improves the constraints on $H_0$ by 30% and on
$\Omega_{k0}$ by over an order of magnitude, with respect to their use merely
as distance indicators. With 5 years of joint ET and Rubin Observatory
follow-ups we could reach precision of 0.1 km/s/Mpc in $H_0$ and 0.02 in
$\Omega_{k0}$ using only data in the range $0<z<0.5$. We also find that the use

linear systems. We focus on two standard benchmarks, the sample complexity of
stabilization, and the regret of the online learning of the Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). Prior results state that the statistical difficulty for both
benchmarks scales polynomially with the system state dimension up to
system-theoretic quantities. However, this does not reveal the whole picture.
By utilizing minimax lower bounds for both benchmarks, we prove that there
exist non-trivial classes of systems for which learning complexity scales
dramatically, i.e. exponentially, with the system dimension. This situation
arises in the case of underactuated systems, i.e. systems with fewer inputs
than states. Such systems are structurally difficult to control and their
system theoretic quantities can scale exponentially with the system dimension
dominating learning complexity. Under some additional structural assumptions
(bounding systems away from uncontrollability), we provide qualitatively
matching upper bounds. We prove that learning complexity can be at most
exponential with the controllability index of the system, that is the degree of
underactuation.

whereby a limited number of sensors are required to detect and track an
increasing number of objects. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of

simulate a controllable Earth-based telescope, which is trained to maximise the

greatly reduced compared to those generated by an alternate (random) policy.
This work provides the basis for further advancements and motivates the use of

studying the geometry of the set $B_n = \left \{ \sum_{j=0}^n v_j (1+i)^j : v_j

shape similar to that found for GC systems in other spiral and elliptical

approximately 65% (35%) of the population having blue (red) colors. The red,
presumably metal-rich GCs are more centrally concentrated, as expected for a
bulge population; while the blue, presumably metal-poor GCs, are more broadly
distributed, consistent with expectations of a halo population. The specific
frequency of GCs in NGC 1291 is higher than found previously in most spiral

the fundamental tradeoff between the estimation Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for
sensing and the data rate for communication, by characterizing the Pareto

formulate a new MIMO rate maximization problem by optimizing the transmit

then properly allocating the transmit power over these subchannels for

It is shown that the optimal transmit covariance is of full rank, which unifies
the conventional rate maximization design with water-filling power allocation

their performances to be impacted. Increasing the number and diversity of
training data is always an option, but with the ground-truth disparity being
limited in remote sensing due to its high cost, it is almost impossible to
obtain the ground-truth for all locations. Knowing that classical stereo
matching methods such as Census-based semi-global-matching (SGM) are widely

reduces the computational overhead of constructing a large kernel matrix and

the low-rank structure in CCNNs and the related subdifferential of nuclear

compositional, and causal structure of a scene as a set of object
representations and thereby promises to resolve many critical limitations of
traditional single-vector representations such as poor systematic
generalization. Although there have been many remarkable advances in recent
years, one of the most critical problems in this direction has been that
previous methods work only with simple and synthetic scenes but not with
complex and naturalistic images or videos. In this paper, we propose STEVE, an
unsupervised model for object-centric learning in videos. Our proposed model
makes a significant advancement by demonstrating its effectiveness on various
complex and naturalistic videos unprecedented in this line of research.
Interestingly, this is achieved by neither adding complexity to the model
architecture nor introducing a new objective or weak supervision. Rather, it is
achieved by a surprisingly simple architecture that uses a transformer-based
image decoder conditioned on slots and the learning objective is simply to
reconstruct the observation. Our experiment results on various complex and
naturalistic videos show significant improvements compared to the previous
state-of-the-art.

afford us the unique opportunity to determine the sources' properties, such as
their masses and spins, with unprecedented accuracy. To do so, however,
theoretical models of the emitted signal that are i) extremely accurate and ii)
computationally highly efficient are necessary. The inclusion of more detailed
physics such as higher-order multipoles and relativistic spin-induced orbital
precession increases the complexity and hence also computational cost of
waveform models, which presents a severe bottleneck to the parameter inference
problem. A popular method to generate waveforms more efficiently is to build a
fast surrogate model of a slower one. In this paper, we show that traditional
surrogate modelling methods combined with artificial neural networks can be
used to build a computationally highly efficient while still accurate emulation
of multipolar time-domain waveform models of precessing binary black holes. We
apply this method to the state-of-the-art waveform model SEOBNRv4PHM and find
significant computational improvements: On a traditional CPU, the typical
generation of a single waveform using our neural network surrogate
SEOBNN_v4PHM_4dq2 takes 18ms for a binary black hole with a total mass of $44
M_{\odot}$ when generated from 20Hz. In comparison to SEOBNRv4PHM itself, this
amounts to an improvement in computational efficiency by two orders of
magnitude. Utilising additional GPU acceleration, we find that this speed-up
can be increased further with the generation of batches of waveforms
simultaneously. Even without additional GPU acceleration, this dramatic
decrease in waveform generation cost can reduce the inference timescale from
weeks to hours.

In order to deem such new settings secure, we first need to understand and
analyze the complexity of the underlying problem, in this case the problem of
decoding a random interleaved code. A simple approach to decode such codes,
would be to randomly choose a vector in the row span of the received matrix and
run a classical information set decoding algorithm on this erroneous codeword.
In this paper, we propose a new generic decoder for interleaved codes, which is
an adaption of the classical idea of information set decoding by Prange and
perfectly fits the interleaved setting. We then analyze the cost of the new

electrification, and digitalization, vehicles are becoming more intelligent
while being exposed to more complex, uncertain, and frequently occurring

vehicle under fault condition and formulate it as a multi-criteria
decision-making problem. The maintenance decisions are generated by route
searching in road networks and evaluated based on risk assessment considering
the uncertainty of vehicle breakdowns. Particularly, we consider two criteria,
namely the risk of public time loss and the risk of mission delay, representing
the concerns of the public sector and the private sector, respectively. A
public time loss model is developed to evaluate the traffic congestion caused
by a vehicle breakdown and the corresponding towing process. The Pareto optimal
set of non-dominated decisions is derived by evaluating the risk of the
decisions. We demonstrate the relevance of the problem and the effectiveness of
the proposed method by numerical experiments derived from real-world scenarios.
The experiments show that neglecting the risk of vehicle breakdown on public
roads can cause a high risk of public time loss in dense traffic flow. With the
proposed method, alternate decisions can be derived to reduce the risks of
public time loss significantly with a low increase in the risk of mission
delay. This study aims at catalyzing public-private partnership through
collaborative decision-making between the private sector and the public sector,
thus archiving a more sustainable transportation system in the future.

understand human suffering or mental pain. Both humans and sophisticated AI
agents process information about the world in order to achieve goals and obtain
rewards, which is why AI can be used as a model of the human brain and mind.
This book intends to make the theory accessible to a relatively general
audience, requiring only some relevant scientific background. The book starts
with the assumption that suffering is mainly caused by frustration. Frustration
means the failure of an agent (whether AI or human) to achieve a goal or a
reward it wanted or expected. Frustration is inevitable because of the
overwhelming complexity of the world, limited computational resources, and
scarcity of good data. In particular, such limitations imply that an agent
acting in the real world must cope with uncontrollability, unpredictability,
and uncertainty, which all lead to frustration. Fundamental in such modelling
is the idea of learning, or adaptation to the environment. While AI uses
machine learning, humans and animals adapt by a combination of evolutionary
mechanisms and ordinary learning. Even frustration is fundamentally an error
signal that the system uses for learning. This book explores various aspects
and limitations of learning algorithms and their implications regarding
suffering. At the end of the book, the computational theory is used to derive
various interventions or training methods that will reduce suffering in humans.
The amount of frustration is expressed by a simple equation which indicates how
it can be reduced. The ensuing interventions are very similar to those proposed
by Buddhist and Stoic philosophy, and include mindfulness meditation.
Therefore, this book can be interpreted as an exposition of a computational
theory justifying why such philosophies and meditation reduce human suffering.

results indicate the possibility of utilizing the Chemical Vapour Deposition
(CVD) on nanostructured photonic devices in a scalable process. Direct growth
of 2D material on nanostructures rectifies many drawbacks of the transfer-based
approaches. We show that the van der Waals materials grow conformally across
the curves, edges, and the silicon-SiO$_2$ interface of the waveguide
structure. Here, the waveguide structure used as a growth substrate is complex
not just in terms of its geometry but also due to the two materials (Si and
SiO$_2$) involved. A transfer-free method like this yields a novel approach for
functionalizing nanostructured, integrated optical architectures with an
optically active direct semiconductor.

reflecting the characteristics of the real city provides beneficial information
for taking reasonable infection control measures in the future. We demonstrate
agent-based modeling for Tokyo based on GPS information and official national
statistics and perform a spatiotemporal analysis of the infection situation in
Tokyo. As a result of the simulation during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in
Tokyo using real GPS data, the infection occurred in the service industry, such
as restaurants, in the city center, and then the infected people brought back
the virus to the residential area; the infection spread in each area in Tokyo.
This phenomenon clarifies that the spread of infection can be curbed by
suppressing going out or strengthening infection prevention measures in service
facilities. It was shown that pandemic measures in Tokyo could be achieved not
only by strong control, such as the lockdown of cities, but also by thorough
infection prevention measures in service facilities, which explains the curb
phenomena in real Tokyo.

  organizational proximity","20 pager, 2 figures, 6 tables, preprint",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Bias in grant allocation is a critical issue, as the expectation is that
grants are given to the best researchers, and not to applicants that are
socially, organizationally, or topic-wise near-by the decision-makers. In this
paper, we investigate the effect of organizational proximity, defined as an
applicant with the same affiliation as one of the panel members (a near-by
panelist), on the probability of getting a grant. This study is based on one of
the most prominent grant schemes in Europe, with overall excellent scientists
as panel members. Various aspects of this organizational proximity are
analyzed: Who gains from it? Does it have a gender dimension? Is it bias, or
can it be explained by performance differences? We do find that the probability
to get funded increases significantly for those that apply in a panel where
there is a panelist from the institution where the applicant has agreed to use
the grant. At the same time, the effect differs between disciplines and
countries, and men profit more of it than women do. Finally, depending on how
one defines what counts as the best researchers, the near-by panelist effect
can be interpreted as preferential attachment (quality links to quality) or as
bias and particularism.

  Healthcare)",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Algorithmic fairness is an increasingly important field concerned with
detecting and mitigating biases in machine learning models. There has been a
wealth of literature for algorithmic fairness in regression and classification
however there has been little exploration of the field for survival analysis.
Survival analysis is the prediction task in which one attempts to predict the
probability of an event occurring over time. Survival predictions are
particularly important in sensitive settings such as when utilising machine
learning for diagnosis and prognosis of patients. In this paper we explore how
to utilise existing survival metrics to measure bias with group fairness
metrics. We explore this in an empirical experiment with 29 survival datasets
and 8 measures. We find that measures of discrimination are able to capture
bias well whereas there is less clarity with measures of calibration and
scoring rules. We suggest further areas for research including prediction-based
fairness metrics for distribution predictions.

an Intelligent-Transportation System. Existing solutions not only use
heavy-weight and costly equipment, but also largely depend on constant cloud
(Internet) connectivity, as well as adequate uninterrupted power-supply. Such
dependencies make these solutions fundamentally impractical considering the
possible adversities of outdoor environment as well as requirement of
correlated wide-area operation. For practical use, apart from being technically
sound and accurate, a solution has to be lightweight, cost-effective,
easy-to-install, flexible as well as supporting efficient time-correlated
coverage over large area. In this work we propose an IoT-assisted strategy to
fulfil all these goals together. We adopt a top-down approach where we first
introduce a lightweight framework for time-correlated low-cost wide-area
measurement and then reuse the concept for developing the individual
measurement units. Our extensive outdoor measurement studies and trace-based
simulation on the empirical data show about 98% accuracy in vehicle detection
and upto 93% of accuracy in classification of the vehicles over moderately busy
urban roads.

pure, applied and philosophical aspects of dimension theory. It concerns a
novel approach toward an alternate dimension theory foundation: the
point-dimension theory. For this purpose, historical research on this notion
and related concepts, combined with critical analysis and philosophical
development proved necessary. Hence, our main objective is to challenge the
conventional zero dimension assigned to the point. This reconsideration allows
us to propose two new ways of conceiving the notion of dimension, which are the
two sides of the same coin. First as an organization; accordingly, we suggest
the existence of the Dimensionad, an elementary particle conferring dimension
to objects and space-time. The idea of the existence of this particle could
possibly adopted as a projection to create an alternative way to unify quantum
mechanics and Einstein's general relativity. Secondly, in connection with
Boltzmann and Shannon entropies, dimension appears essentially as a comparison
between entropies of sets. Thus, we started from the point and succeeded in
constructing a point-dimension notion allowing us to extend the principle of
box dimension in many directions. More precisely, we introduce the notion of
point-extended box dimension in the large framework of topological vector
spaces, freeing it from the notion of metric. This general setting permits us
to treat the case of finite, infinite and invisible dimensions. This first part
of our research project focuses essentially on general properties and is
particularly oriented towards establishing a well founded framework for
infinite dimension. Among others, one prospect is to test the possibility of
using other types of spaces as a setting for quantum mechanics, instead of
limiting it to the exclusive Hilbertian framework.

reduces the required energy sufficiently to enable the generation of two-colour
few-femtosecond DUV pulses.

Through general analysis and numerical experiments we find that the average
energy may have good analytical property as a function of this real parameter
$\xi$, which provides the chance to calculate the thermodynamical properties of
identical fermions by an extrapolation with a simple polynomial function after
accurately calculating the thermodynamic properties of the fictitious particles

molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) with desired morphology via chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) remains a challenge. In CVD, the complex interplay of various
factors like growth temperature, precursors, and nature of the substrate
decides the crystallinity, crystallite size, and coverage area of the grown
MoS$_2$ monolayer. In the present work, we report about the role of weight
fraction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$), Sulfur, and carrier gas flow rate
towards nucleation and monolayer growth. The concentration of MoO$_3$ weight
fraction has been found to govern the self-seeding process and decides the
density of nucleation sites affecting morphology and coverage area. Carrier gas
flow of 100 sccm argon results into large crystallite continuous films with
lower coverage area (70 %), while the flow rate of 150 sccm results into 92 %
coverage area with reduced crystallite size. Through systematic variation of
experimental parameters, we have established the recipe for the growth of large
crystallite atomically thin MoS$_2$ suitable for optoelectronic devices.
