Hilbert space operators $(S,P),$ for which $\Gamma$ is a spectral set, is
called a $\Gamma$-contraction. We study $\Gamma$-contractions that are
annihilated by a polynomial whose zero set defines a distinguished variety in

$\Gamma$-distinguished. We characterize the $\Gamma$-distinguished pure
$\Gamma$-contractions on a finite dimensional Hilbert space. Along with several

$\Gamma$-isometric dilation of a $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contraction
becomes $\Gamma$-distinguished.

  Geo-localization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aerial-view geo-localization tends to determine an unknown position through
matching the drone-view image with the geo-tagged satellite-view image. This
task is mostly regarded as an image retrieval problem. The key underpinning
this task is to design a series of deep neural networks to learn discriminative
image descriptors. However, existing methods meet large performance drops under
realistic weather, such as rain and fog, since they do not take the domain
shift between the training data and multiple test environments into
consideration. To minor this domain gap, we propose a Multiple-environment
Self-adaptive Network (MuSe-Net) to dynamically adjust the domain shift caused
by environmental changing. In particular, MuSe-Net employs a two-branch neural
network containing one multiple-environment style extraction network and one
self-adaptive feature extraction network. As the name implies, the
multiple-environment style extraction network is to extract the
environment-related style information, while the self-adaptive feature
extraction network utilizes an adaptive modulation module to dynamically
minimize the environment-related style gap. Extensive experiments on two
widely-used benchmarks, i.e., University-1652 and CVUSA, demonstrate that the
proposed MuSe-Net achieves a competitive result for geo-localization in
multiple environments. Furthermore, we observe that the proposed method also
shows great potential to the unseen extreme weather, such as mixing the fog,
rain and snow.

representation on the whole data space, which means treating all features
equally. However, a subspace is often sufficient for accurate representation in
practical applications, and redundant features can be invalid or even harmful.
For example, if a camera has some sensors destroyed, then the corresponding
pixels in the photos from this camera are not helpful to identify the content,
which means only the subspace consisting of remaining pixels is worthy of
attention. This paper proposes a new NMF method by introducing adaptive weights
to identify key features in the original space so that only a subspace involves
generating the new representation. Two strategies are proposed to achieve this:
the fuzzier weighted technique and entropy regularized weighted technique, both
of which result in an iterative solution with a simple form. Experimental
results on several real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed methods
can generate a more accurate feature representation than existing methods. The

may be understood as a projective structure equipped with a certain holonomy
reduction to the (possibly indefinite) unitary quaternionic group
$\textrm{Sp}(p,q)$, namely a parallel hyperk\""ahler structure on the projective
tractor bundle satisfying a particular genericity condition. For the converse,
where one begins with a general parallel hyperk\""ahler structure on the

prove that generically such a reduction decomposes the underlying manifold into
a disjoint union of strata including open manifolds with (indefinite)
$3$-Sasaki structures and a closed separating hypersurface at infinity with
respect to the $3$-Sasaki metrics. Moreover, it is shown that the latter
hypersurface inherits a Biquard-Fefferman conformal structure, which thus
(locally) fibres over a quaternionic contact structure, and which in turn
compactifies the natural quaternionic K\""ahler quotients of the $3$-Sasaki

compactification of (suitably) complete, non-compact (indefinite) $3$-Sasaki

problem in distributed computing. It is well-known that distributed MST can be
solved in $\tilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ rounds in the standard CONGEST model (where
$n$ is the network size and $D$ is the network diameter) and this is
essentially the best possible round complexity (up to logarithmic factors).
However, in resource-constrained networks such as ad hoc wireless and sensor
networks, nodes spending so much time can lead to significant spending of
resources such as energy.
  Motivated by the above consideration, we study distributed algorithms for MST
under the \emph{sleeping model} [Chatterjee et al., PODC 2020], a model for
design and analysis of resource-efficient distributed algorithms. In the
sleeping model, a node can be in one of two modes in any round --
\emph{sleeping} or \emph{awake} (unlike the traditional model where nodes are
always awake). Only the rounds in which a node is \emph{awake} are counted,
while \emph{sleeping} rounds are ignored. A node spends resources only in the
awake rounds and hence the main goal is to minimize the \emph{awake complexity}
of a distributed algorithm, the worst-case number of rounds any node is awake.
  We present deterministic and randomized distributed MST algorithms that have
an \emph{optimal} awake complexity of $O(\log n)$ time with a matching lower
bound. We also show that our randomized awake-optimal algorithm has essentially
the best possible round complexity by presenting a lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ on the product of the awake and round complexity of any
distributed algorithm (including randomized) that outputs an MST. To complement
our trade-off lower bound, we present a parameterized family of distributed
algorithms that gives an essentially optimal trade-off between the awake
complexity and the round complexity.

The routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input

strategy and distill it into a lightweight router decoupled from the backbone
model. In the second training stage, we utilize the distilled router to
determine the token-to-expert assignment and freeze it for a stable routing

Recent advances in EISR exploit distillation and aggregation strategies with

limited hierarchical features. In contrast, sequential network operations avoid
frequently accessing preceding states and extra nodes, and thus are beneficial
to reducing the memory consumption and runtime overhead. Following this idea,
we design our lightweight network backbone by mainly stacking multiple highly
optimized convolution and activation layers and decreasing the usage of feature
fusion. We propose a novel sequential attention branch, where every pixel is
assigned an important factor according to local and global contexts, to enhance
high-frequency details. In addition, we tailor the residual block for EISR and
propose an enhanced residual block (ERB) to further accelerate the network
inference. Finally, combining all the above techniques, we construct a fast and

faster and reduces 74% memory consumption compared with the state-of-the-art

Unfortunately, ensuring that SLOs are not violated in inference-serving systems

unpredictable query patterns, and co-location interference. In this paper, we
observe that neural networks exhibit high degrees of per-input activation
sparsity during inference. . Thus, we propose SLO-Aware Neural Networks which
dynamically drop out nodes per-inference query, thereby tuning the amount of
computation performed, according to specified SLO optimization targets and
machine utilization. SLO-Aware Neural Networks achieve average speedups of
$1.3-56.7\times$ with little to no accuracy loss (less than 0.3%). When
accuracy constrained, SLO-Aware Neural Networks are able to serve a range of
accuracy targets at low latency with the same trained model. When latency
constrained, SLO-Aware Neural Networks can proactively alleviate latency
degradation from co-location interference while maintaining high accuracy to

the observed transport process. This work discusses some general properties of
the third and the fourth current cumulant (skewness and kurtosis) related to
dynamics and thermodynamics of a transport setup. Specifically, several
distinct bounds on these quantities are either analytically derived or
numerically conjectured, which are applicable to: 1) noninteracting fermionic
systems, 2) noninteracting bosonic systems, 3) thermally driven classical
Markovian systems, 4) unicyclic Markovian networks. Finally, it is demonstrated
that violation of the obtained inequalities can provide a broad spectrum of
information about the physics of the analyzed system, e.g., enable one to infer
the presence of interactions or unitary dynamics, unravel the topology of the
Markovian network, or characterize the nature of thermodynamic forces driving
the system. In particular, relevant information about the microscopic dynamics
can be gained even at equilibrium when the current variance -- a standard
measure of current fluctuations -- is determined mostly by the thermal noise.

wealth of information on the assembly history of the Milky Way. We use some
information-theoretic measures to study the anisotropy in a set of Milky
Way-sized stellar halos from the Bullock & Johnston suite of simulations that
uses a hybrid approach coupling semi-analytic and N-body techniques. Our
analysis shows that the whole-sky anisotropy in each stellar halo increases
with the distance from its centre and eventually plateaus out beyond a certain
radius. All the stellar halos have a very smooth structure within a radius of
$\sim 50$ kpc and a highly anisotropic structure in the outskirts. At a given
radius, the anisotropies at a fixed polar or azimuthal angle have two distinct
components: (i) an approximately isotropic component and (ii) a component with
large density fluctuations on small spatial scales. We remove the contributions
of the substructures and any non-spherical shape of the halo by randomizing the
polar and azimuthal coordinates of the stellar particles while keeping their
radial distances fixed. We observe that the fluctuating part of the anisotropy
is completely eliminated, and the approximately uniform component of the
anisotropy is significantly reduced after the sphericalization. A comparison
between the original halos and their sphericalized versions reveals that the
approximately uniform part of the anisotropy originates from the discreteness
noise and the non-spherical shape of the halo whereas the substructures
contribute to the fluctuating part. We show that such distinction between the
anisotropies has the potential to constrain the shape of the stellar halo and
its substructures.

precise measurement of time and acceleration of quantum manipulations. Since
energetic coherence is fragile, it is essential to understand the limits in
distillation and dilution to restore damage. The resource theory of asymmetry
(RTA) provides a rigorous framework to investigate energetic coherence as a
resource to break time-translation symmetry. Recently, in the i.i.d. regime
where identical copies of a state are converted into identical copies of
another state, it has been shown that the convertibility of energetic coherence
is governed by a standard measure of energetic coherence, called the quantum
Fisher information (QFI). This fact means that QFI in the theory of energetic
coherence takes the place of entropy in thermodynamics and entanglement entropy
in entanglement theory. However, distillation and dilution in realistic
situations take place in regimes beyond i.i.d., where quantum states often have
complex correlations. Unlike entanglement theory, the conversion theory of
energetic coherence in pure states in the non-i.i.d. regime has been an open
problem. In this Letter, we solve this problem by introducing a new technique:
an information-spectrum method for QFI. Two fundamental quantities, coherence
cost and distillable coherence, are shown to be equal to the spectral QFI rates
for arbitrary sequences of pure states. As a consequence, we find that both
entanglement theory and RTA in the non-i.i.d. regime are understood in the
information-spectrum method, while they are based on different quantities,
i.e., entropy and QFI, respectively.

inhomogeneous broadening is substantially larger than the homogeneous

dielectric function of many glasses, polymers, and other natural and artificial

impose large computation and memory overheads, and are not directly trained to
model such stable estimation. They can converge poorly and thereby suffer from
performance degradation. To combat these drawbacks, we propose deep equilibrium
(DEQ) flow estimators, an approach that directly solves for the flow as the
infinite-level fixed point of an implicit layer (using any black-box solver),
and differentiates through this fixed point analytically (thus requiring $O(1)$
training memory). This implicit-depth approach is not predicated on any
specific model, and thus can be applied to a wide range of SOTA flow estimation
model designs. The use of these DEQ flow estimators allows us to compute the
flow faster using, e.g., fixed-point reuse and inexact gradients, consumes
$4\sim6\times$ times less training memory than the recurrent counterpart, and
achieves better results with the same computation budget. In addition, we
propose a novel, sparse fixed-point correction scheme to stabilize our DEQ flow
estimators, which addresses a longstanding challenge for DEQ models in general.
We test our approach in various realistic settings and show that it improves
SOTA methods on Sintel and KITTI datasets with substantially better

intuition or mathematical and computational simplicity rather than on
statistical evidence. To evaluate the quality of a network representation we
need to consider both the amount of information required by a random network

of network ensembles generated by the popular configuration model and its

default window, VSA employs a window regression module to predict the size and
location of the target window, i.e., the attention area where the key and value
tokens are sampled. By adopting VSA independently for each attention head, it
can model long-term dependencies, capture rich context from diverse windows,
and promote information exchange among overlapped windows. VSA is an
easy-to-implement module that can replace the window attention in
state-of-the-art representative models with minor modifications and negligible
extra computational cost while improving their performance by a large margin,
e.g., 1.1\% for Swin-T on ImageNet classification. In addition, the performance
gain increases when using larger images for training and test. Experimental

the Bondi boundary condition of $\rho \to const.$ as $r\to \infty$ to $\rho \to
0$ as $r \to \infty$. This change allows for simple power law solutions on the
density and infall velocity fields, ranging from a cold empty free-fall
condition where pressure tends to zero, to a hot hydrostatic equilibrium limit
with no infall velocity. As in the case of the Bondi solution, a maximum
accretion rate appears. As in the $\gamma=5/3$ case of the Bondi solution, no
sonic radius appears, this time however, because the flow is always
characterised by a constant Mach number. This number equals 1 for the case of
the maximum accretion rate, diverges towards the cold empty state, and becomes
subsonic towards the hydrostatic equilibrium limit. It can be shown that in the
limit as { $r \to 0$}, the Bondi solution tends to the new solution presented,
{ extending the validity of the Bondi accretion value to} cases where the
accretion density profile does not remain at a fixed constant value out to
infinity. We then explore small deviations from sphericity and the presence of
angular momentum through an analytic perturbative analysis. Such perturbed
solutions yield a rich phenomenology through density and velocity fields in
terms of Legendre polynomials, which we begin to explore for simple angular
velocity boundary conditions having zeros on the plane and pole. The new
solution presented provides complementary physical insight into accretion
problems in general.

have, however, had instances where they exhibit a change in their periods.
Older theories have shown that older pulsars have a tendency to skip and speed
up. Newer theories have been created, due to the discovery that younger X-ray
pulsars exhibit the same skips. The older theories explain that the core of the
pulsar is a superfluid with a differential rotation and the core will
occasionally exhibit solid properties to catch the crust of the pulsar and

hydrodynamic limits in large-scale stochastic interacting particle systems.
However, the past few decades have witnessed only minimal progress according to
[Goncalves-Landim-Milanes '17]. In this paper, we develop a general method for
deriving the so-called Boltzmann-Gibbs principle for a general family of

responding to Spohn and Jensen-Yau. Most importantly, our method depends mostly
on local and dynamical, and thus more general/universal, features of the model.
This contrasts with previous works, which rely on global and non-universal
assumptions on invariant measures or initial measures of the model. As a
concrete application of the method, we derive the KPZ equation as a large-scale
limit of the height functions for a family of non-stationary and non-integrable
exclusion processes with an environment-dependent asymmetry. This establishes a

(GR), first derived by Einstein in 1918, but their existence was debated as the
derivation was only available in the linearized version of the theory. Only in
1960 the existence of GW in full GR was established. The non-trivial task of
finding a workable definition for gravitational waves in general relativity was
achieved and their existence as a solution to the Einstein equations for
vanishing cosmological constant has been proven. But although much work has
been done to extend this proof the case of a positive cosmological constant
(which is a best fit model of cosmology with current observations) a
description in the full non-linear theory is still missing. We take inspiration
from the Bondi-Sachs formalism and approach the problem in a novel way, by
describing a geometry via geodesics and thus removing the degeneracy between
coordinates and the metric. Our formalism uses infinitesimal spherical
triangles as geometry generating elements, to relate the geodesic flow bundle
to Gaussian curvature. This ultimately allows us to calculate all geodesics
from a curvature field up to second order. In this paper we describe the first
step of the space-like part of the solution, in which we reduce an
n-dimensional problem to a 2-dimensional triangulation problem.

learn a complete representation of the lesion. To be specific, LR task employs
contrastive learning to encourage representation that pulls multiple views of
the same lesion and repels those of different lesions. The task therefore
facilitates a representation that is not only invariant to the view change of
the lesion, but also capturing fine-grained features to distinguish between
different lesions. Experiments show that the proposed multi-task framework
boosts the performance of Benign/Malignant classification as two sub-tasks
complement each other and enhance the learned representation of ultrasound

realistic orbits around the MW (as determined by Gaia). The escape fraction of
GCs from 13 dSphs is in the range $12\%$ to $93\%$. The average escape time of
GCs from these dSphs was less than 8 $\,\mathrm{Gyrs}$, indicating that the
escape process of GCs from dSphs was over. We then adopt a set of

dust-continuum luminosity from $z=0$ to $z=3$, extending such trends to fainter
galaxies at $2.1<z<2.5$ than observed to date. We find no second-order
metallicity dependence in the CO - dust-continuum luminosity relation for the

$2.1<z<2.5$ are consistent with an increase in the DTG with gas-phase
metallicity. The metallicity dependence of the DTG is driven by the metallicity
dependence of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor. Galaxies at z$=$2.1-2.5 are
furthermore consistent with the DTG-metallicity relation found at z$=$0 (i.e.
with no significant evolution), providing relevant constraints for galaxy

growth of matter perturbations and generates relative density and velocity
perturbations between Dark Matter and baryons that grow over time. We derive
constraints from current CMB and BAO data, bounding the strength of the dark
fifth force to be less than a percent of gravity. These are the strongest
constraints to date. We present potential implications of this scenario for the

position of the red giant branch luminosity bump, a diagnostic of the maximum
extent of the convective envelope during the first dredge up. Global
asteroseismic parameters, the large frequency separation and frequency of
maximum oscillation power, measured for large samples of red giants, show that
modeling convective overshoot below the convective envelope helps match the
modeled luminosity bump positions to observations. However, these global
parameters cannot be used to probe envelope overshoot in a star-by-star manner.
Red giant mixed modes, which behave like acoustic modes at the surface and like
gravity modes in the core, contain important information about the interior
structure of the star, especially near the convective boundary. Therefore,
these modes may be used to probe interior processes, such as overshoot. Using a
grid of red giant models with varying mass, metallicity, surface gravity,
overshoot treatment, and amount of envelope overshoot, we find that changing
the overshoot amplitude (and prescription) of overshoot below the convection
zone in red giant stellar models results in significant differences in the
evolution of the models' dipole mixed-mode oscillation frequencies, the average
mixed mode period spacing, $\langle \Delta P \rangle$, and gravity mode phase
offset term, $\epsilon_g$.

powered by the spin-down of a magnetar central engine. Up to now, the
intermediate regime between these two populations has remained mostly
unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive study of 40 \textit{luminous

by SLSNe on the bright end and by SNe Ib/c on the dim end. Spectroscopically,
LSNe appear to form a continuum between Type Ic SNe and SLSNe. Given their
intermediate nature, we model the light curves of all LSNe using a combined
magnetar plus radioactive decay model and find that they are indeed
intermediate, not only in terms of their peak luminosity and spectra, but also
in their rise times, power sources, and physical parameters. We sub-classify
LSNe into distinct groups that are either as fast-evolving as SNe Ib/c or as
slow-evolving as SLSNe, and appear to be either radioactively or magnetar
powered, respectively. Our findings indicate that LSNe are powered by either an
over-abundant production of $^{56}$Ni or by weak magnetar engines, and may
serve as the missing link between the two populations.

upper giant branch stars. The most commonly invoked explanation for this is
thermohaline mixing. One-dimensional stellar evolution models include various
prescriptions for thermohaline mixing, but the use of observational data
directly to discriminate between thermohaline prescriptions has thus far been
limited. Here, we propose a new framework to facilitate direct comparison:
Using carbon-to-nitrogen measurements from the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey as a probe
of mixing and a fluid parameter known as the reduced density ratio from
one-dimensional stellar evolution programs, we compare the observed amount of
extra mixing on the upper giant branch to predicted trends from
three-dimensional fluid dynamics simulations. Using this method, we are able to
empirically constrain how mixing efficiency should vary with the reduced
density ratio. We find the observed amount of extra mixing is strongly
correlated with the reduced density ratio and that trends between reduced
density ratio and fundamental stellar parameters are robust across choices for
modeling prescription. We show that stars with available mixing data tend to
have relatively low density ratios, which should inform the regimes selected
for future simulation efforts. Finally, we show that there is increased mixing
at low reduced density ratios, which is consistent with current hydrodynamical
models of thermohaline mixing. The introduction of this framework sets a new
standard for theoretical modeling efforts, as validation for not only the
amount of extra mixing, but trends between the degree of extra mixing and
fundamental stellar parameters is now possible.

means to exploit the power of variational circuits: We find eigenstates by
finding joint roots of a polynomially growing number of properties of the

pool of our choice. The most remarkable feature of our CoVaR approach is that
it allows us to fully exploit the extremely powerful classical shadow
techniques, i.e., we simultaneously estimate a very large number $>10^4-10^7$
of covariances. We randomly select covariances and estimate analytical
derivatives at each iteration applying a stochastic Levenberg-Marquardt step
via a large but tractable linear system of equations that we solve with a
classical computer. We prove that the cost in quantum resources per iteration
is comparable to a standard gradient estimation, however, we observe in
numerical simulations a very significant improvement by many orders of
magnitude in convergence speed. CoVaR is directly analogous to stochastic
gradient-based optimisations of paramount importance to classical machine
learning while we also offload significant but tractable work onto the

proposed methods are evaluated on models, datasets, and settings of different
complexities. To advance the research of coreset selection in deep learning, we
contribute a comprehensive code library, namely DeepCore, and provide an
empirical study on popular coreset selection methods on CIFAR10 and ImageNet
datasets. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets verify that,
although various methods have advantages in certain experiment settings, random
selection is still a strong baseline.

resonance spectra on extracted material parameters is investigated using
numerical simulations. Our results show that the systematic error of assuming
an incorrect number of resonances for a material can lead to the extraction of
material parameters that significantly deviate from any of the true material
parameters. When noise is present in experimental ferromagnetic resonance
spectra increasing the frequency range of the broadband characterization can
significantly reduce the error-margins when the data is analyzed assuming the
correct number of resonances present in the material. For the cases
investigated in this study it was found that analyzing the data using a single
resonance results in extracted gyromagnetic ratios and effective magnetization
parameters that are consistent with the weighted average of the true material
parameters. We further provide a cautionary example regarding the extraction of
the inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and damping parameters of materials that
contain an unknown number of resonances.

of solar-like stars. It is commonly accepted that their central stars (CSPN)
experienced a very late thermal pulse (VLTP), ejecting H-deficient material
inside the evolved H-rich PN. Given the short duration of this event and the
fast subsequent evolution of the CSPN, details of the mass ejection are
unknown. We present the first morpho-kinematic model of the H-deficient
material surrounding a born-again PN, namely A30. New San Pedro M\'{a}rtir
observations with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph were recently obtained to
map the inner region of A30 which are interpreted by means of the software
SHAPE in conjunction with HST WFC3 images. The SHAPE morpho-kinematic model
that best reproduces the observations is composed by a disrupted disk tilted
$37^\circ$ with respect to the line of sight and a pair of orthogonal opposite
bipolar ejections. We confirm previous suggestions that the structures closer
to the CSPN present the highest expansion velocities, that is, the disrupted
disk expands faster than the farther bipolar features. We propose that the
current physical structure and abundance discrepancy of the H-deficient clumps
around the CSPN of A30 can be explained by a common envelope phase following
the VLTP event. Our proposed scenario is also compared with other known
born-again PNe (A58, A78, HuBi1 and the Sakurai's Object).

However, this setting is far from realistic use cases that instead require
executing multiple tasks in the same environment. Even if the environment
changes over time, the agent could still count on its global knowledge about
the scene while trying to adapt its internal representation to the current

the Difference: a novel task for Embodied AI where the agent has access to an
outdated map of the environment and needs to recover the correct layout in a
fixed time budget. To this end, we collect a new dataset of occupancy maps
starting from existing datasets of 3D spaces and generating a number of
possible layouts for a single environment. This dataset can be employed in the
popular Habitat simulator and is fully compliant with existing methods that
employ reconstructed occupancy maps during navigation. Furthermore, we propose
an exploration policy that can take advantage of previous knowledge of the
environment and identify changes in the scene faster and more effectively than
existing agents. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for exploration on this new

is one of the most uncertain parameters directly affecting collisional growth
of aggregates in planet-forming disks. Despite its importance, the monomer size
has not yet been meaningfully constrained by disk observations. Aims: We
attempt to derive the monomer size from optical and near-infrared (IR)
polarimetric observations of planet-forming disks. Methods: We perform a
comprehensive parameter survey on the degree of linear polarization of light
scattered by dust aggregates, using an exact numerical method called the
$T$-matrix method. We investigate the effect of the monomer size, aggregate
size, porosity, and composition on the degree of polarization. The obtained
results are then compared with observed polarization fractions of several
planet-forming disks at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Results: It is shown
that the degree of polarization of aggregates depends sensitively on the
monomer size unless the monomer size parameter is smaller than one or two.
Comparing the simulation results with the disk observations, we find that the
monomer radius is no greater than $0.4~\mu$m. The inferred monomer size is
therefore similar to subunit sizes of the solar system dust aggregates and the
maximum size of interstellar grains. Conclusions: Optical and near-IR
quantitative polarimetry will provide observational grounds on the initial
conditions for dust coagulation and thereby planetesimal formation in
planet-forming disks.

there are many AGN in groups and clusters with jets that are not bent, which
leads us to ask: why are some AGN jets affected so much by their environment
while others are seemingly not? We present the results of an environmental
study on a sample of 185 AGN with bent jets and 191 AGN with unbent jets in
which we characterize their environments by searching for neighboring galaxies
using a Friends-of-Friends algorithm. We find that AGN with bent jets are
indeed more likely to reside in groups and clusters, while unbent AGN are more
likely to exist in singles or pairs. When considering only AGN in groups of 3
or more galaxies, we find that bent AGN are more likely to exist in halos with
more galaxies than unbent AGN. We also find that unbent AGN are more likely
than bent AGN to be the brightest group galaxy. Additionally, groups hosting
AGN with bent jets have a higher density of galaxies than groups hosting unbent
AGN. Curiously, there is a population of AGN with bent jets that are in
seemingly less dense regions of space, indicating they may be embedded in a
cosmic web filament. Overall, our results indicate that bent doubles are more
likely to exist in in larger, denser, and less relaxed environments than unbent
doubles, potentially linking a galaxy's radio morphology to its environment.

FRBs may be linked to magnetar bursts. Using fully 3D force-free

by Alfv\'{e}n waves launched from localized magnetar quakes: a wave packet
propagates to the outer magnetosphere, becomes nonlinear, and escapes the
magnetosphere, forming an ultra-relativistic ejecta. The ejecta pushes open the
magnetospheric field lines, creating current sheets behind it. Magnetic
reconnection can happen at these current sheets, leading to plasma energization
and X-ray emission. The angular size of the ejecta can be compact, $\lesssim 1$

inversion (FWI). FWI is a data fitting method aimed at inverting for subsurface
mechanical parameters. Despite the large adoption of FWI by the academic and
industrial communities, and many successful results, FWI still suffers from
severe limitations. From a mathematical standpoint, FWI is a large scale
PDE-constrained optimization problem. The misfit function that is used, which
measures the discrepancy between observed seismic data and data calculated
through the solution of a wave propagation problem, is non-convex. After
discretization, the size of the FWI problem requires the use of local
optimization solvers, which are prone to converge towards local minima. Thus
the success of FWI strongly depends on the choice of the initial model to
ensure the convergence towards the global minimum of the misfit function.
  This limitation has been the motivation for a large variety of strategies.
Among the different methods that have been investigated, the use of optimal
transport (OT) distances-based misfit functions has been recently promoted. The
leading idea is to benefit from the inherent convexity of OT distances with
respect to dilation and translation to render the FWI problem more convex.
However, the application of OT distances in the framework of FWI is not
straightforward, as seismic data is signed, while OT has been developed for the
comparison of probability measures.
  The purpose of this study is to review two methods that were developed to
overcome this difficulty. Both have been successfully applied to field data in
an industrial framework. Both make it possible to better exploit the seismic
data, alleviating the sensitivity to the initial model and to various
conventional workflow steps, and reducing the uncertainty attached to the
subsurface mechanical parameters inversion.

optimum approach is to have simple non-error corrected personal devices that
offload the computational tasks to scalable quantum computers via edge servers

elements deploy different encoding protocols. This article proposes quantum
terminals that are compatible with different encoding protocols; paving the way
for realizing mobile edge-quantum computing. By accommodating the atomic
lattice processor inside a cavity, the entangling mechanism is provided by the
Rydberg-Fermi cavity-QED technology. The gate operates by the Fermi scattering
of a Rydberg electron from the plaquette atoms hosting the physical qubits.
Therefore, different arrangements of logical-qubits derive the central atom
over distinguished eigenstates, featuring photon emission at the early or late
times distinguished by quantum interference. Applying an entanglement-swapping
gate on two emitted photons would make the far-separated qubits entangled
regardless of their encoding protocols. This gate provides a universal photonic
interface for clustering the processors and connecting them with the quantum
memories and quantum cloud that is compatible with different encoding formats.

phase transition to the distribution of word frequencies in the English
language. Usually, their presence is only apparent when data is abundant, and
accurately determining their exponents often requires even larger amounts of
data. As the scale of recordings in neuroscience becomes larger, an increasing
number of studies attempt to characterise potential power-law relationships in
neural data. In this paper, we aim to discuss the potential pitfalls that one
faces in such efforts and to promote a Bayesian interpolation framework for
this purpose. We apply this framework to synthetic data and to data from a
recent study of large-scale recordings in mouse primary visual cortex (V1),
where the exponent of a power-law scaling in the data played an important role:
its value was argued to determine whether the population's stimulus-response
relationship is smooth, and experimental data was provided to confirm that this
is indeed so. Our analysis shows that with such data types and sizes as we
consider here, the best-fit values found for the parameters of the power law
and the uncertainty for these estimates are heavily dependent on the noise
model assumed for the estimation, the range of the data chosen, and (with all
other things being equal) the particular recordings. It is thus challenging to
offer a reliable statement about the exponents of the power law. Our analysis,
however, shows that this does not affect the conclusions regarding the
smoothness of the population response to low-dimensional stimuli but casts
doubt on those to natural images. We discuss the implications of this result
for the neural code in the V1 and offer the approach discussed here as a
framework that future studies, perhaps exploring larger ranges of data, can
employ as their starting point to examine power-law scalings in neural data.

oxygen levels are more radioresistant than chronically hypoxic ones and hence,
this population may determine radiotherapy (RT) response, in particular for
hypofractionated RT, where reoxygenation may not be as prominent. A
considerable effort has been devoted to examining the impact of hypoxia on
hypofractionated RT; however, much less attention has been paid to cyclic
hypoxia specifically and the role its kinetics may play in determining the
efficacy of these treatments. Here, a simple mathematical model of cyclic
hypoxia and fractionation effects was worked out to quantify this. Cancer
clonogen survival fraction was estimated using the linear quadratic model,
modified to account for oxygen enhancement effects and inter-fraction tissue
oxygen kinetics. The resulting survival fraction formula was used to derive an
expression for the iso-survival biologically effective dose, $\bedeff$. These
were computed for some common extra-cranial hypofractionated radiotherapy
regimens. Using relevant literature parameter values, inter-fraction
fluctuations in oxygenation were found to result in an added 1-2 logs of
clonogen survival fraction in going from five fractions to one for the same
nominal biologically effective dose. $\bedeff$'s for most
ultra-hypofractionated (five or fewer fractions) regimens in a given tumour
site are similar in magnitude, suggesting iso-efficacy for common fractionation
schedules. Although significant, the loss of cell-killing with increasing
hypofractionation is not nearly as large as previous estimates based on the
assumption of complete reoxygenation between fractions. Most
ultra-hypofractionated regimens currently in place offer sufficiently high
doses to counter this loss of cell killing, although care should be taken in
implementing single-fraction regimens.

Going from the deep interior to the top of the atmosphere, we describe volcanic

Furthermore, we address more complex aspects of the history of Venus, including
the role of Late Accretion impacts, how magnetic field generation is tied into
long-term evolution, and the implications of geochemical and geodynamical
feedback cycles for atmospheric evolution. We highlight plausible end-member
evolutionary pathways that Venus could have followed, from accretion to its
present-day state, based on modeling and observations. In a first scenario, the
planet was desiccated by atmospheric escape during the magma ocean phase. In a
second scenario, Venus could have harbored surface liquid water for long
periods of time, until its temperate climate was destabilized and it entered a
runaway greenhouse phase. In a third scenario, Venus's inefficient outgassing
could have kept water inside the planet, where hydrogen was trapped in the core

two-dimensional CR-magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the role of
CRs in accelerating multi-phase gas formed via thermal instability. We compare
outflows driven by CRs to those driven by a hot wind with equivalent momentum.
We find that CRs driven outflow produces lower density contrast between cold
and hot gas due to non-thermal pressure support, and yields a more filamentary
cloud morphology. While entrainment in a hot wind can lead to cold gas
increasing due to efficient cooling, CRs tend to suppress cold gas growth. The
mechanism of this suppression depends on magnetic field strength, with CRs
either reducing cooling or shredding the clouds by differential acceleration.
Despite the suppression of cold gas growth, CRs are able to launch the cold
clouds to observed velocities without rapid destruction. The dynamical
interaction between CRs ad multi-phase gas is also sensitive to the magnetic
field strength. In relatively strong fields, the CRs are more important for
direct momentum input to cold gas. In relatively weak fields, the CRs impact
gas primarily by heating, which modifies gas pressure.

partially observed Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems disturbed by process and
output noise. To compensate against the induced variability due to both types
of noises, state regulation is subject to two risk constraints. The latter
renders the resulting controller cautious of stochastic disturbances, by
restricting the statistical variability, namely, a simplified version of the
cumulative expected predictive variance of both the state and the output. Our
proposed formulation results in an optimal risk-averse policy that preserves
favorable characteristics of the classical Linear Quadratic (LQ) control. In
particular, the optimal policy has an affine structure with respect to the
minimum mean square error (mmse) estimates. The linear component of the policy
regulates the state more strictly in riskier directions, where the process and
output noise covariance, cross-covariance, and the corresponding penalties are
simultaneously large. This is achieved by ""inflating"" the state penalty in a
systematic way. The additional affine terms force the state against pure and
cross third-order statistics of the process and output disturbances. Another
favorable characteristic of our optimal policy is that it can be pre-computed
off-line, thus, avoiding limitations of prior work. Stability analysis shows
that the derived controller is always internally stable regardless of parameter
tuning. The functionality of the proposed risk-averse policy is illustrated
through a working example via extensive numerical simulations.

Properties of matter inside a neutron star are encoded in its equation of

the current understanding of quantum chromodynamics, it is hard to determine
the interactions of neutron star matter at such high densities. Also performing
many body calculations is computationally intractable. Besides the constitution
of the neutron star core is highly speculative -- it is not ruled out that it
contains exotic matter like strange baryons, meson condensates, quark matter,
etc. Although the matter inside the neutron star is extremely dense, but the
temperature of this object is very cold in most of its life span. We cannot
produce such dense but rather cold material in our laboratory. Since probing
the physics of neutron star matter is inaccessible by our earth based
experiments, we look for astrophysical observations of neutron stars. This
thesis deals with the theoretical and computational techniques required to
translate neutron star observables from astrophysical observations to its

the dependency of conventional methods on internal dynamic states such as

performance, including a physics-data-infusion approach to determining the
inter-dependencies between buses, and a loss term to respect the known physical
law of the power system, i.e., the Kirchhoff's law, to ensure the feasibility

issue of unidirectional completion flow, previous methods convert the original
problem into inpainting, which allows a bidirectional flow. However, we find
that inpainting has its own limitations and is inferior to outpainting in
certain situations. The question of how they may be combined for the best of
both has as yet remained under-explored. In this paper, we provide a deep
analysis of the differences between inpainting and outpainting, which
essentially depends on how the source pixels contribute to the unknown regions
under different spatial arrangements. Motivated by this analysis, we present a
Cylin-Painting framework that involves meaningful collaborations between
inpainting and outpainting and efficiently fuses the different arrangements,
with a view to leveraging their complementary benefits on a consistent and
seamless cylinder. Nevertheless, directly applying the cylinder-style
convolution often generates visually unpleasing results as it could discard
important positional information. To address this issue, we further present a
learnable positional embedding strategy and incorporate the missing component
of positional encoding into the cylinder convolution, which significantly
improves the panoramic results. Note that while developed for image

additional information is needed to generate natural language sentences, as

architecture is proposed that learns from both acoustic features and extracted
audio event labels as inputs. The proposed model is based on pre-trained
acoustic features and audio event detection. Various experiments used different
acoustic features, word embedding models, audio event label extraction methods,
and implementation configurations to show which combinations have better
performance on the audio captioning task. Results of the extensive experiments

important but also extremely challenging problem due to the lack of complete
offline information. By tapping into the power of machine learning (ML) based
optimizers, ML-augmented online algorithms (also referred to as expert
calibration in this paper) have been emerging as state of the art, with
provable worst-case performance guarantees. Nonetheless, by using the standard
practice of training an ML model as a standalone optimizer and plugging it into
an ML-augmented algorithm, the average cost performance can be highly
unsatisfactory. In order to address the ""how to learn"" challenge, we propose
EC-L2O (expert-calibrated learning to optimize), which trains an ML-based
optimizer by explicitly taking into account the downstream expert calibrator.
To accomplish this, we propose a new differentiable expert calibrator that
generalizes regularized online balanced descent and offers a provably better
competitive ratio than pure ML predictions when the prediction error is large.
For training, our loss function is a weighted sum of two different losses --
one minimizing the average ML prediction error for better robustness, and the
other one minimizing the post-calibration average cost. We also provide
theoretical analysis for EC-L2O, highlighting that expert calibration can be
even beneficial for the average cost performance and that the high-percentile
tail ratio of the cost achieved by EC-L2O to that of the offline optimal oracle
(i.e., tail cost ratio) can be bounded. Finally, we test EC-L2O by running
simulations for sustainable datacenter demand response. Our results demonstrate
that EC-L2O can empirically achieve a lower average cost as well as a lower

outputs a distribution over the action latent variable given a state of the
system, and (ii) unsupervised training of a generative model that outputs a

enables safe exploration and alleviates the data-inefficiency problem as it
exploits prior knowledge about valid sequences of motor actions. Moreover, we
provide a set of measures for evaluation of generative models such that we are
able to predict the performance of the RL policy training prior to the actual

hardware Trojan attacks requires: (1) fast and reliable exploration of the
viable Trojan attack space for a given design and (2) a suite of high-quality
Trojan-inserted benchmarks that meet specific standards. The latter has become
essential for the development and evaluation of design/verification solutions
to achieve quantifiable assurance against Trojan attacks. While existing static
benchmarks provide a baseline for comparing different countermeasures, they
only enumerate a limited number of handcrafted Trojans from the complete Trojan
design space. To accomplish these dual objectives, in this paper, we present
MIMIC, a novel AI-guided framework for automatic Trojan insertion, which can
create a large population of valid Trojans for a given design by mimicking the
properties of a small set of known Trojans. While there exist tools to
automatically insert Trojan instances using fixed Trojan templates, they cannot
analyze known Trojan attacks for creating new instances that accurately capture
the threat model. MIMIC works in two major steps: (1) it analyzes structural
and functional features of existing Trojan populations in a multi-dimensional
space to train machine learning models and generate a large number of ""virtual
Trojans"" of the given design, (2) next, it binds them into the design by
matching their functional/structural properties with suitable nets of the
internal logic structure. We have developed a complete tool flow for MIMIC,
extensively evaluated the framework by exploring several use-cases, and

demand for timely predicting citywide crime occurrence. Accurate crime
prediction results are vital for the beforehand decision-making of government
to alleviate the increasing concern about the public safety. While many efforts
have been devoted to proposing various spatial-temporal forecasting techniques
to explore dependence across locations and time periods, most of them follow a
supervised learning manner, which limits their spatial-temporal representation
ability on sparse crime data. Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised
learning, this work proposes a Spatial-Temporal Hypergraph Self-Supervised
Learning framework (ST-HSL) to tackle the label scarcity issue in crime
prediction. Specifically, we propose the cross-region hypergraph structure
learning to encode region-wise crime dependency under the entire urban space.
Furthermore, we design the dual-stage self-supervised learning paradigm, to not
only jointly capture local- and global-level spatial-temporal crime patterns,
but also supplement the sparse crime representation by augmenting region
self-discrimination. We perform extensive experiments on two real-life crime
datasets. Evaluation results show that our ST-HSL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis provides insights into the
superiority of our ST-HSL method in the representation of spatial-temporal
crime patterns. The implementation code is available at

  regularization techniques",,,"10.1007/978-3-031-07258-1_106",,"math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The idea of exploiting sparseness in under-determined damage characterization
problems is not new, and regularizations techniques that tend to promote
sparseness, such as L1-norm minimization, have been investigated in the last
ten years or so. Although various claims of merit have been made, two
interconnected issues put these claims into question, and this paper brings
some attention to the matter. The first is that the relationship between the
structural parameters and the modal features previously considered has been
linear and to ensure that the premise was closely realized, only very small
damage severities have been considered. The second issue, intimately related to
the first, is the fact that the noise, which has been typically taken as small
relative to the ""change in the features"", is then unrealistically small. In
problems where the damage is sufficiently large, the nonlinear dependence of
the features on the parameters cannot be generally discarded. It is found that
the attainable performance is much less ""impressive"" that what has been often
claimed. The paper also examines the potential merit of using Lp-norm (0<p<1)
minimization, instead of L1-norm minimization which, to the knowledge of the
writers, has not been previously examined in damage characterization research.
In this case we also find that, contrary to claims made in other areas, this
norm does not lead to any general improvement over the performance attained by
minimizing the L1-norm.

PDS70, we recover the detection of PDS70c from the July 2019 data, but only at
8sigma. However, its non-detection in Dec. 2017 suggests that PDS70c is

the Halpha variability. We also pick up fine structure in the inner disc, such

design. This paper considers DFRC systems using MIMO radar with a sparse
transmit array, transmitting OFDM waveforms, and assigning shared and private
subcarriers to active transmit antennas. Subcarrier sharing allows antennas to
modulate data symbols onto the same subcarriers and enables high communication
rate, while the use of private subcarriers trades-off communication rate for
sensing performance by enabling the formulation of a virtual array with larger
aperture than the physical receive array. We propose to exploit the permutation
of private subcarriers among the available subcarriers and the pairing between
active antennas and private subcarriers to recover some of the communication

propose a low complexity algorithm to identify private subcarriers and detect

applications over the last decade. Much research attention has focused on
building exploit mitigation defenses for this problem, but no technique
provides adequate protection in the face of advanced attacks. One technique
that bypasses XSS mitigations is the scriptless attack: a content injection
technique that uses (among other options) CSS and HTML injection to infiltrate
data. In studying this technique and others, we realized that the common
property among the exploitation of all content injection vulnerabilities,
including not just XSS and scriptless attacks, but also command injections and
several others, is an unintended context switch in the victim program's parsing
engine that is caused by untrusted user input.
  In this paper, we propose Context-Auditor, a novel technique that leverages
this insight to identify content injection vulnerabilities ranging from XSS to
scriptless attacks and command injections. We implemented Context-Auditor as a
general solution to content injection exploit detection problem in the form of
a flexible, stand-alone detection module. We deployed instances of
Context-Auditor as (1) a browser plugin, (2) a web proxy (3) a web server
plugin, and (4) as a wrapper around potentially-injectable system endpoints.
Because Context-Auditor targets the root cause of content injection
exploitation (and, more specifically for the purpose of our prototype, XSS
exploitation, scriptless exploitation, and command injection), our evaluation
results demonstrate that Context-Auditor can identify and block content
injection exploits that modern defenses cannot while maintaining low throughput
overhead and avoiding false positives.

applications due to the need of tight cooperation among swarm members for
collision-free path planning. Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution
(CTDE) in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is a promising method for
multi-UAV collision avoidance, in which the key challenge is to effectively
learn decentralized policies that can maximize a global reward cooperatively.
We propose a new multi-agent critic-actor learning scheme called MACA for UAV
swarm collision avoidance. MACA uses a centralized critic to maximize the
discounted global reward that considers both safety and energy efficiency, and
an actor per UAV to find decentralized policies to avoid collisions. To solve
the credit assignment problem in CTDE, we design a counterfactual baseline that
marginalizes both an agent's state and action, enabling to evaluate the
importance of an agent in the joint observation-action space. To train and
evaluate MACA, we design our own simulation environment MACAEnv to closely
mimic the realistic behaviors of a UAV swarm. Simulation results show that MACA
achieves more than 16% higher average reward than two state-of-the-art MARL
algorithms and reduces failure rate by 90% and response time by over 99%

localized sublimation vapor flows with sufficient gas densities to enable
particle saltation. We calculate anticipated outgassing velocities from
lava-SO$_2$ frost interactions, and compare these to the saltation thresholds
predicted when accounting for the tenuous nature of the sublimated vapor. We
find that saltation may occur if frost temperatures surpass 155 K. Finally we

$LDL^{T}$ (or generalized Cholesky) decomposition, conditions of general
$Z_{2}$-invariance for the neutrino mass matrix $m$ is obtained in an arbitrary
basis. The conditions are found to be $(M_{22} a_{i}^{+} - M_{12} b_{i}^{+}) \,
( M_{22} a_{j}^{-} - M_{12} b_{j}^{-}) = - \det M \, b_{i}^{+} \, b_{j}^{-}$
for the $Z_{2}$-symmetric and -antisymmetric part of a Yukawa matrix
$Y_{ij}^{\pm} \equiv (Y \pm T Y )_{ij} /2 \equiv (a_{j}^{\pm}, b_{j}^{\pm})$
and the right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M_{ij}$. In other words, the
symmetric and antisymmetric part of $b_{i}$ must be proportional to those of
the quantity $\tilde a_{i} \equiv a_{i} - {M_{12} \over M_{22}} b_{i}$. They
are equivalent to the condition that $m$ is block diagonalized by eigenvectors
of the generator $T$.
  These results are applied to three $Z_{2}$ symmetries, the $\mu-\tau$
symmetry, the TM$_{1}$ mixing, and the magic symmetry which predicts the
TM$_{2}$ mixing. For the case of TM$_{1,2}$, the symmetry conditions become $
M_{22}^{2} \, \tilde {a}_{1}^{\rm TBM} \tilde a_{2}^{\rm TBM} = - \det M \,
b_{1}^{\rm TBM} b_{2}^{\rm TBM}$ and $ M_{22}^{2} \, \tilde {a}_{1,2}^{\rm TBM}

components $\tilde a_{i}^{\rm TBM}$ and $b_{i}^{\rm TBM}$ in the TBM basis
$\mathbf{v}_{1,2,3}$. In particular, for the TM$_{2}$ mixing, the magic
(anti-)symmetric Yukawa matrix with $S_{2} Y = \pm Y$ is phenomenologically
excluded because it predicts $m_{2}=0$ or $m_{1}, m_{3} = 0$. In the case where
Yukawa is not (anti-)symmetric, the mass singular values are displayed without
a root sign.

This paper details the implementation of a novel Machine Learning architecture,
called Flux+Mutability, which combines cutting-edge conditional generative

distribution of a reference class. The `mutability' stage at inference
addresses if data significantly deviates from the reference class. We
demonstrate the validity of our approach and its connection to multiple
problems spanning from one-class classification to anomaly detection. In
particular, we apply our method to the isolation of neutral showers in an
electromagnetic calorimeter and show its performance in detecting anomalous
dijets events from standard QCD background. This approach limits assumptions on
the reference sample and remains agnostic to the complementary class of objects
of a given problem. We describe the possibility of dynamically generating a
reference population and defining selection criteria via quantile cuts.
Remarkably this flexible architecture can be deployed for a wide range of
problems, and applications like multi-class classification or data quality

formulations: classic interchange theory and ideal MHD. Classic interchange
theory, which is developed in detail in this paper, is basically analytic and
is relatively straightforward to determine computationally, but it cannot offer
very high accuracy. The two formalisms agree well for the plasma sheet and also
for the inner magnetosphere. The eigenfrequencies range over about a factor of
seven, but the formulations generally agree with a root-mean-square difference
between the logarithms of interchange and MHD frequencies to be $\sim 0.054$.
The pressure perturbations in the classic interchange theory are assumed
constant along each field line, but the MHD computed pressure perturbations
along the field line vary in a range $\sim 30 \%$ in the plasma sheet but are
larger in the inner magnetosphere. The parallel and perpendicular
displacements, which are very different in the plasma sheet and inner
magnetosphere, show good qualitative agreement between the two approaches. In
the plasma sheet, the perpendicular displacements are strongly concentrated in
the equatorial plane, whereas the parallel displacements are spread through
most of the plasma sheet away from the equatorial plane; and can be regarded as
buoyancy waves. In the inner magnetosphere, the displacements are more
sinusoidal and are more like conventional slow modes. The different forms of
the waves are best characterized by the flux tube entropy $PV^\gamma$.

of the peak profile, as well as the temperature and magnetic-field dependence

in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, skyrmions are weakly distorted, and the distortion is
field-dependent in a way that the dominant higher-order modulation switches

large in fact that the optical opacity of the detection medium itself becomes
an important factor. If the detector is so large that photons cannot traverse

and low ground-truth incident rates cannot be naively distinguished. We develop
a method to identify (heterogeneous) reporting rates, without using external

about the same incident can be leveraged to disambiguate whether an incident
has occurred with its reporting rate once it has occurred. Using this idea, we
reduce the question to a standard Poisson rate estimation task -- even though

single corpus setting, the performance of these SER systems degrades
significantly for cross-corpus and cross-language scenarios. The key reason is
the lack of generalisation in SER systems towards unseen conditions, which
causes them to perform poorly in cross-corpus and cross-language settings.
Recent studies focus on utilising adversarial methods to learn domain
generalised representation for improving cross-corpus and cross-language SER to
address this issue. However, many of these methods only focus on cross-corpus
SER without addressing the cross-language SER performance degradation due to a
larger domain gap between source and target language data. This contribution
proposes an adversarial dual discriminator (ADDi) network that uses the
three-players adversarial game to learn generalised representations without
requiring any target data labels. We also introduce a self-supervised ADDi
(sADDi) network that utilises self-supervised pre-training with unlabelled
data. We propose synthetic data generation as a pretext task in sADDi, enabling
the network to produce emotionally discriminative and domain invariant
representations and providing complementary synthetic data to augment the
system. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated using five publicly
available datasets in three languages and compared with multiple studies on
cross-corpus and cross-language SER. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed model achieves improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art

potential physical laws. To fill this gap, we present a theory to characterize
the RNA virus evolution as a physical system with absorbing states and
avalanche behaviors. This approach maps accessible biological data (e.g.,
phylogenetic tree and infection) to a general stochastic process of RNA virus
infection and evolution, enabling researchers to verify potential
self-organized criticality underlying RNA virus evolution. We apply our
framework to SARS-CoV-2, the virus accounting for the global epidemic of
COVID-19. We find that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits scale-invariant avalanches as
mean-field theory predictions. The observed scaling relation, universal
collapse, and slowly decaying auto-correlation suggest a self-organized
critical dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Interestingly, the lineages that
emerge from critical evolution processes coincidentally match with threatening
lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., the Delta virus). We anticipate our approach to
be a general formalism to portray RNA virus evolution and help identify

constants, or more physically, the degenerate, temperature-dependent functions

for constants $0\leq \alpha\leq 1/(\gamma-1)$,
$\bar{\mu}>0,~2\bar{\mu}+n\bar{\lambda}\geq0,~\bar{\kappa}\geq 0$, and

  With prescribed decaying rate of the initial density across the vacuum
boundary, we prove that: (1) for three-dimensional spherically symmetric flows
with non-vanishing bulk viscosity and zero heat conductivity, entropy-bounded
classical solutions do not exist for any small time, provided the initial
velocity is expanding near the boundary; (2) for three-dimensional spherically
symmetric flows with non-vanishing heat conductivity, the normal derivative of
the temperature of the classical solution across the free boundary does not
degenerate, and therefore the entropy immediately blowups if the decaying rate
of the initial density is not of $1/(\gamma-1)$ power of the distance function
to the boundary; (3) for one-dimensional flow with zero heat conductivity, the
non-existence result is similar but need more restrictions on the decaying
rate.

near-unity value of the ratio of fluctuations in the vacuum energy density of

by way of calculating the noise kernels which are the correlators of the
stress-energy tensor of quantum fields. In this paper we revisit this issue via
a quantum thermodynamics approach, by calculating two quintessential
thermodynamic quantities: the heat capacity and the quantum compressibility of
some model geometries filled with a quantum field at high and low temperatures.
This is because heat capacity at constant volume gives a measure of the
fluctuations of the energy density to the mean. When this ratio approaches or
exceeds unity, the validity of the canonical distribution is called into
question. Likewise, a system's compressibility at constant pressure is a
criterion for the validity of grand canonical ensemble. We derive the free
energy density and, from it, obtain the expressions for these two thermodynamic
quantities for thermal and quantum fields in 2d Casimir space, 2d Einstein

specific heat and sharp changes of the nuclear spin-spin ($T_2^{-1}$) and
spin-lattice ($T_1^{-1}$) relaxation rates. The fact that the entropy release
is extremely small and the Knight shift is almost independent of temperature
down to low temperatures as anticipated in a paramagnetic metal indicates that
the $T_Q$ transition is of non-magnetic origin. In addition, we detected a
crossover scale $T_0\sim30$ K below which the resistivity and the NMR linewidth
increase, and $T_1^{-1}$ is progressively distributed in space, that is, a
static and dynamical spatial inhomogeneity develops. While the order parameter
for the $T_Q$ transition remains an open question, a group-theoretical analysis
suggests that the finite electric quadrupole density arising from the low local
site symmetry at cobalt sites could drive the crystal symmetry lowering from
the P2$_1$3 symmetry that is commensurate to the R3 symmetry with an
incommensurate wavevector, which fairly well accounts for the $T_Q$ transition.

typical SOTA system is composed of four main modules -- mapper, global planner,

this paper, we build a robust and safe local planner which is designed to
generate a velocity plan to track a coarsely planned path from the global
planner. Previous works used waypoint-based methods (e.g.
Proportional-Differential control and pure pursuit) which simplify the path
tracking problem to local point-goal navigation. However, they suffer from
frequent collisions in geometrically complex and narrow environments because of
two reasons; the global planner uses a coarse and inaccurate model and the
local planner is unable to track the global plan sufficiently well. Currently,
deep learning methods are an appealing alternative because they can learn
safety and path feasibility from experience more accurately. However, existing
deep learning methods are not capable of planning for a long horizon. In this
work, we propose a learning-based fully autonomous navigation framework
composed of three innovative elements: a learned forward dynamics model (FDM),
an online sampling-based model-predictive controller, and an informed
trajectory sampler (ITS). Using our framework, a quadruped robot can
autonomously navigate in various complex environments without a collision and
generate a smoother command plan compared to the baseline method. Furthermore,

temperature with the value of $\sim-$18 $\mu$V/K at 800 K. The negative sign of
$S$ in the full temperature window signifies the dominating $n$-type character
of the compound. The temperature dependent of electrical conductivity, $\sigma$
(thermal conductivity, $\kappa$) exhibits the increasing (decreasing) trend
with the values of $\sim$1.2 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ $\Omega^{-1}$m$^{-1}$

replication (SMR) that dynamically allocates the state to be transferred among
replicas according to changes in communication bandwidths. SMR improves fault
tolerance by replicating a service to multiple replicas. When a replica is
newly added or recovered from a failure, the other replicas transfer the
current state of the service to it. However, in geographic SMR, the
communication bandwidths of replicas are different and constantly changing.
Therefore, existing state transfer methods cannot fully utilize the available
bandwidth, and their state transfer time increases. To overcome this problem,
our method divides the state into multiple chunks and assigns them to replicas
based on each replica's bandwidth so that the broader a replica's bandwidth is,
the more chunks it transfers. The proposed method also updates the chunk
assignment of each replica dynamically based on the currently estimated
bandwidth. The performance evaluation on Amazon EC2 shows that the proposed
method reduces the state transfer time by up to 47% compared to the existing
one. In addition, we apply the proposed method to dynamic replacement of
replicas, which can mitigate latency degradation caused by network trouble, and
evaluate how fast the method can relocate a replica.

Dir-MUSIC algorithm is derived based on the array manifold characteristics.
This method uses strength intensity information rather than the TDOA
information, which could reduce the computational difficulty and the
requirement of array size. Second, the effects of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

atomic sites and binding pose can provide vital information in understanding
the process of drug binding. Based on this mechanism, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were invented as a useful tool for investigating the dynamic
properties of a molecular system. However, the computational expenditure limits
the growth and application of protein trajectory-related studies, thus
hindering the possibility of supervised learning. To tackle this obstacle, we
present a novel spatial-temporal pre-training method based on the modified
Equivariant Graph Matching Networks (EGMN), dubbed ProtMD, which has two
specially designed self-supervised learning tasks: an atom-level prompt-based
denoising generative task and a conformation-level snapshot ordering task to
seize the flexibility information inside MD trajectories with very fine
temporal resolutions. The ProtMD can grant the encoder network the capacity to
capture the time-dependent geometric mobility of conformations along MD
trajectories. Two downstream tasks are chosen, i.e., the binding affinity
prediction and the ligand efficacy prediction, to verify the effectiveness of
ProtMD through linear detection and task-specific fine-tuning. We observe a
huge improvement from current state-of-the-art methods, with a decrease of
4.3\% in RMSE for the binding affinity problem and an average increase of
13.8\% in AUROC and AUPRC for the ligand efficacy problem. The results
demonstrate valuable insight into a strong correlation between the magnitude of
conformation's motion in the 3D space (i.e., flexibility) and the strength with
which the ligand binds with its receptor.

influence of the intense linearly polarized monochromatic laser fields with
high frequency. First, we rewrite the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation
using Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation which allows for shifting all
time dependence of the problem into the potential function. Then, for the
intense laser fields that satisfy the high frequency limit, the time-averaged
scheme in the KH framework should be valid. We can use WKB approximation to
evaluate Coulomb barrier penetrability and then calculate proton-boron nuclear
fusion cross sections by a phenomenological Gamow form. We show that the
corresponding Coulomb barrier penetrability increases significantly due to the
depression of the time-averaged potential barrier. As a result, we find that
proton-boron nuclear fusion cross sections can be enhanced effectively
depending on a dimensionless quantity $n_{\mathrm{d}}$, which equals the ratio
of the quiver oscillation amplitude to the geometrical touching radius of the
proton and boron nucleus. For $n_{\mathrm{d}}=9$, we predict that the resonance
peak of the fusion cross-section is enhanced by about $26$ times at the
incident energy of $\varepsilon=148$ keV. And for another incident energy of
$\varepsilon=586$ keV, the resonance peak of fusion cross-section is not only
enhanced but also shifted to lower energy of $\varepsilon=392$ keV due to the

beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The mechanism of neutrino mass
generation is still unknown. The observed suppression of neutrino masses hints
at a large scale, conceivably of the order of the scale of a Grand Unified
Theory (GUT), a unique feature of neutrinos that is not shared by the charged
fermions. The origin of neutrino masses and mixing is part of the outstanding
puzzle of fermion masses and mixings, which is not explained in the SM. Flavor
model building for both quark and lepton sectors is important in order to gain
a better understanding of the origin of the structure of mass hierarchy and
flavor mixing, which constitute the dominant fraction of the SM parameters.
Recent activities in neutrino flavor model building based on non-Abelian
discrete flavor symmetries and modular flavor symmetries have been shown to be
a promising direction to explore. The emerging models provide a framework that
has a significantly reduced number of undetermined parameters in the flavor
sector. Model building based on non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries and
their modular variants enables the particle physics community to interpret the
current and anticipated upcoming data from neutrino experiments. Pursuit of
flavor model building based on such frameworks can also provide connections to
possible UV completions, in particular to string theory. We emphasize the
importance of constructing models in which the uncertainties of theoretical

distributed systems. However, it is particularly difficult, mainly due to the
presence of Byzantine processes that act arbitrarily and the unknown message
delays in general networks.
  Although it is well known that both safety and liveness are at risk as soon
as $n/3$ Byzantine processes fail, very few works attempted to characterize
precisely the faults that produce safety violations from the faults that
produce termination violations.
  In this paper, we present a new lower bound on the solvability of the
consensus problem by distinguishing deceitful faults violating safety and
benign faults violating termination from the more general Byzantine faults, in
what we call the Byzantine-deceitful-benign fault model. We show that one
cannot solve consensus if $n\leq 3t+d+2q$ with $t$ Byzantine processes, $d$
deceitful processes, and $q$ benign processes.
  In addition, we show that this bound is tight by presenting the Basilic class
of consensus protocols that solve consensus when $n > 3t+d+2q$. These protocols
differ in the number of processes from which they wait to receive messages
before progressing. Each of these protocols is thus better suited for some
applications depending on the predominance of benign or deceitful faults.
  Finally, we study the fault tolerance of the Basilic class of consensus
protocols in the context of blockchains that need to solve the weaker problem
of eventual consensus. We demonstrate that Basilic solves this problem with
only $n > 2t+d+q$, hence demonstrating how it can strengthen blockchain

understanding. Based on video sequences, the goal is to recognize actions

recognition of human actions in the infrared domain is a highly challenging
task because of the redundant and indistinguishable texture features present in
the sequence. Furthermore, in some cases, challenges arise from the irrelevant
information induced by the presence of multiple active persons not contributing
to the actual action of interest. Therefore, most existing methods consider a
standard paradigm that does not take into account these challenges, which is in
some part due to the ambiguous definition of the recognition task in some

recognize efficiently human actions in the infrared spectrum, while
automatically identifying the key-actors performing the action without using
any prior knowledge or explicit annotations. Our method is composed of three
stages. In the first stage, optical flow-based key-actor identification is

complex atomistic systems from first principles. Recently deep learning models
become a popular way to accelerate MD. Notwithstanding, existing models depend
on intermediate variables such as the potential energy or force fields to
update atomic positions, which requires additional computations to perform
back-propagation. To waive this requirement, we propose a novel model called
DiffMD by directly estimating the gradient of the log density of molecular
conformations. DiffMD relies on a score-based denoising diffusion generative
model that perturbs the molecular structure with a conditional noise depending
on atomic accelerations and treats conformations at previous timeframes as the
prior distribution for sampling. Another challenge of modeling such a
conformation generation process is that a molecule is kinetic instead of
static, which no prior works have strictly studied. To solve this challenge, we
propose an equivariant geometric Transformer as the score function in the
diffusion process to calculate corresponding gradients. It incorporates the
directions and velocities of atomic motions via 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel
representations. With multiple architectural improvements, we outperform
state-of-the-art baselines on MD17 and isomers of C7O2H10 datasets. This work

and fixed grid and treating each cell as a token. However, not all regions are
equally important in human-centric vision tasks, e.g., the human body needs a
fine representation with many tokens, while the image background can be modeled
by a few tokens. To address this problem, we propose a novel Vision
Transformer, called Token Clustering Transformer (TCFormer), which merges
tokens by progressive clustering, where the tokens can be merged from different
locations with flexible shapes and sizes. The tokens in TCFormer can not only
focus on important areas but also adjust the token shapes to fit the semantic
concept and adopt a fine resolution for regions containing critical details,
which is beneficial to capturing detailed information. Extensive experiments
show that TCFormer consistently outperforms its counterparts on different
challenging human-centric tasks and datasets, including whole-body pose
estimation on COCO-WholeBody and 3D human mesh reconstruction on 3DPW. Code is

  sensitivity and strong robustness against excess noise and variation in
  squeezing parameter",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.107.032610",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a generalized echo squeezing protocol (GESP) as a generalization
of the Schr\""odinger cat state protocol (SCSP) with the value of the squeezing
parameter being an arbitrary number rather than pi/2. We show analytically that
over a broad range of the squeezing parameter the sensitivity reaches the
Heisenberg limit (HL) within a factor of root-2. For a large number of
particles, N, this plateau interval is almost the whole range from zero to
pi/2, and the sensitivity is independent of the parity of N. Therefore, it is
possible to operate a sensor over a wide interval of the squeezing parameter
without changing the sensitivity. This is to be contrasted with the
conventional echo squeezing protocol (CESP) which only works for a very small
interval. In contrast to the CESP, the sensitivity of the GESP is close to the
quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound over the whole range of the squeezing parameter. The
enhancement in sensitivity for the GESP is due to a combination of two
parameters: the phase magnification factor (PMF) and the noise amplification
factor (NAF). As the value of the squeezing parameter increases, both PMF and
NAF increase, keeping the ratio of PMF/NAF constant, yielding an enhancement of
sensitivity at the HL within a factor of root-2. Thus, the robustness of the
GESP against excess noise easily exceeds that of the CESP for a broad range of
values of the squeezing parameter. As such, in the context of an experimental
study, it should be possible to achieve a net enhancement in sensitivity higher
than that for the CESP, under typical conditions where the excess noise exceeds
the unsqueezed quantum projection noise. Finally, we consider the fragility of
the GESP against collisions with background particles, and show how a balance
between the fragility and the robustness against excess noise would in practice
determine the optimal choice of parameters for the GESP.

methods using machine learning have been developed. The random split
cross-validation is the de facto standard for model building and evaluation in
machine learning, but care should be taken in adverse event prediction because
this approach does not match to the real-world situation. The time split, which
uses the time axis, is considered suitable for real-world prediction. However,
the differences in model performance obtained using the time and random splits
are not clear due to the lack of the comparable studies. To understand the
differences, we compared the model performance between the time and random
splits using nine types of compound information as input, eight adverse events
as targets, and six machine learning algorithms. The random split showed higher
area under the curve values than did the time split for six of eight targets.
The chemical spaces of the training and test datasets of the time split were
similar, suggesting that the concept of applicability domain is insufficient to
explain the differences derived from the splitting. The area under the curve
differences were smaller for the protein interaction than for the other
datasets. Subsequent detailed analyses suggested the danger of confounding in
the use of knowledge-based information in the time split. These findings
indicate the importance of understanding the differences between the time and
random splits in adverse event prediction and strongly suggest that appropriate
use of the splitting strategies and interpretation of results are necessary for
the real-world prediction of adverse events. We provide analysis code and
datasets used in the present study

the attention mechanism utilized in Transformer Encoder is that it cannot
automatically capture the information of word order, so explicit position
embeddings are generally required to be fed into the target model. In contrast,
Transformer Decoder with the causal attention masks is naturally sensitive to
the word order. In this work, we focus on improving the position encoding
ability of BERT with the causal attention masks. Furthermore, we propose a new
pre-trained language model DecBERT and evaluate it on the GLUE benchmark.
Experimental results show that (1) the causal attention mask is effective for
BERT on the language understanding tasks; (2) our DecBERT model without
position embeddings achieve comparable performance on the GLUE benchmark; and
(3) our modification accelerates the pre-training process and DecBERT w/ PE
achieves better overall performance than the baseline systems when pre-training

adversarial to the target NMT model or the auxiliary backward one, as the
reconstruction error through the RTT can be related to either. To remedy this
problem, we propose a new criterion for NMT adversarial examples based on the
Doubly Round-Trip Translation (DRTT). Specifically, apart from the
source-target-source RTT, we also consider the target-source-target one, which
is utilized to pick out the authentic adversarial examples for the target NMT
model. Additionally, to enhance the robustness of the NMT model, we introduce
the masked language models to construct bilingual adversarial pairs based on
DRTT, which are used to train the NMT model directly. Extensive experiments on
both the clean and noisy test sets (including the artificial and natural noise)
show that our approach substantially improves the robustness of NMT models.

conditions, open-loop optimal control exists, which can be characterized by the
optimality system, a coupled system of an FSVIE and a Type-II backward SVIE
(BSVIE, for short). To obtain a causal state feedback representation for the
open-loop optimal control, a path-dependent Riccati equation for an
operator-valued function is introduced, via which the optimality system can be
decoupled. In the process of decoupling, a Type-III BSVIE is introduced whose
adapted solution can be used to represent the adapted M-solution of the
corresponding Type-II BSVIE. Under certain conditions, it is proved that the
path-dependent Riccati equation admits a unique solution, which means that the
decoupling field for the optimality system is found. Therefore a causal state
feedback representation of the open-loop optimal control is constructed. An
additional interesting finding is that when the control only appears in the
diffusion term, not in the drift term of the state system, the causal state
feedback reduces to a Markovian state feedback.

problems (COPs) via machine learning (ML). To find high-quality solutions
efficiently, existing work uses a ML prediction of the optimal solution to
guide heuristic search, where the ML model is trained offline under the
supervision of solved problem instances with known optimal solutions. To
predict the optimal solution with sufficient accuracy, it is critical to
provide a ML model with adequate features that can effectively characterize
decision variables. However, acquiring such features is challenging due to the
high complexity of COPs. This paper proposes a framework that can better
characterize decision variables by harnessing feedback from a heuristic search
over several iterative steps, enabling an offline-trained ML model to predict
the optimal solution in an adaptive manner. We refer to this approach as
adaptive solution prediction (ASP). Specifically, we employ a set of
statistical measures as features, which can extract useful information from
feasible solutions found by a heuristic search and inform the ML model as to
which value a decision variable is likely to take in high-quality solutions.
Our experiments on three NP-hard COPs show that ASP substantially improves the
prediction quality of an offline-trained ML model and achieves competitive
results compared to several heuristic methods in terms of solution quality.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that ASP can be used as a heuristic-pricing method
for column generation, to boost an exact branch-and-price algorithm for solving
the graph coloring problem.

semantically relevant data across different modalities based on a query in any
modality has attracted great attention in remote sensing (RS). In this paper,
we focus our attention on cross-modal text-image retrieval, where queries from
one modality (e.g., text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g.,
image). Most of the existing cross-modal text-image retrieval systems in RS
require a high number of labeled training samples and also do not allow fast
and memory-efficient retrieval. These issues limit the applicability of the
existing cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale applications in RS. To
address this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel unsupervised
cross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for text-image retrieval in RS.
To this end, the proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules: 1) feature
extraction module, which extracts deep representations of two modalities; 2)
hashing module that learns to generate cross-modal binary hash codes from the
extracted representations. We introduce a novel multi-objective loss function
including: i) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in
intra- and inter-modal similarities; ii) an adversarial objective that is
enforced across two modalities for cross-modal representation consistency; and
iii) binarization objectives for generating hash codes. Experimental results
show that the proposed DUCH outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

use Variational Encoder Decoder structures (VED), a non-linear dimensionality
reduction technique, to learn and understand convective processes in an
aquaplanet superparameterized climate model simulation, where deep convective
processes are simulated explicitly. We show that similar to previous deep
learning studies based on feed-forward neural nets, the VED is capable of
learning and accurately reproducing convective processes. In contrast to past
work, we show this can be achieved by compressing the original information into
only five latent nodes. As a result, the VED can be used to understand
convective processes and delineate modes of convection through the exploration
of its latent dimensions. A close investigation of the latent space enables the
identification of different convective regimes: a) stable conditions are
clearly distinguished from deep convection with low outgoing longwave radiation
and strong precipitation; b) high optically thin cirrus-like clouds are
separated from low optically thick cumulus clouds; and c) shallow convective
processes are associated with large-scale moisture content and surface diabatic
heating. Our results demonstrate that VEDs can accurately represent convective

understanding of sub-grid-scale physical processes, paving the way to
increasingly interpretable machine learning parameterizations with promising

continuous-time quantum walk with two internal states, which has been
formulated in the first paper (arXiv:2112.08119), we physically implement a
quantum random access memory (qRAM). Data with address information are
dual-rail encoded into quantum walkers. The walkers pass through perfect binary
trees to access the designated memory cells and copy the data stored in the
cells. A roundabout gate allocated at each node serves as a router to move the
walker from the parent node to one of two child nodes, depending on the
internal state of the walker. In this process, the address information is
sequentially encoded into the internal states so that the walkers are
adequately delivered to the target cells. The present qRAM, which processes
$2^n$ $m$-qubit data, is implemented in a quantum circuit of depth
$O(n\log(n+m))$ and requires $O(n+m)$ qubit resources. This is more efficient
than the conventional bucket-brigade qRAM that requires $O(n^2+nm)$ steps and
$O(2^{n}+m)$ qubit resources for processing. Moreover, since the walkers are
not entangled with any device on the binary trees, the cost of maintaining
coherence can be reduced. Notably, by simply passing quantum walkers through
binary trees, data can be automatically extracted in a quantum superposition
state. In other words, any time-dependent control is not required.

that the Platinum GRB data compilation, with 50 long GRBs (with relatively flat
plateaus and no flares) in the redshift range $0.553 \leq z \leq 5.0$, and the
LGRB95 data compilation, with 95 long GRBs in $0.297 \leq z \leq 9.4$, as well
as the 145 GRB combination of the two, strongly favor the three-dimensional
(3D) fundamental plane (Dainotti) correlation relation (between the peak prompt
lumininosity, the luminosity at the end of the plateau emission, and its rest
frame duration) over the two-dimensional one (between the luminosity at the end
of the plateau emission and its duration). The 3D Dainotti correlations in the
three data sets are standardizable. We find that while LGRB95 data have
$\sim50$% larger intrinsic scatter parameter values than the better-quality
Platinum data, they provide somewhat tighter constraints on cosmological-model
and GRB-correlation parameters, perhaps solely due to the larger number of data
points, 95 versus 50. This suggests that when compiling GRB data for the
purpose of constraining cosmological parameters, given the quality of current
GRB data, intrinsic scatter parameter reduction must be balanced against
reduced sample size.

the light hadron and heavy hadron systems. The chiral perturbation theory
($\chi$PT) is the low energy effective field theory of the QCD. In this work,
we shall review the investigations on the chiral corrections to the properties
of the heavy mesons and baryons within the framework of $\chi$PT. We will also
review the scatterings of the light pseudoscalar mesons and heavy hadrons,
through which many new resonances such as the $D_{s0}^\ast(2317)$ could be
understood.
  Moreover, many new hadron states were observed experimentally in the past
decades. A large group of these states is near-threshold resonances, such as
the charged charmoniumlike $Z_c$ and $Z_{cs}$ states, bottomoniumlike $Z_b$
states, hidden-charm pentaquark $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ states and the doubly
charmed $T_{cc}$ state, etc. They are very good candidates of the loosely bound
molecular states composed of a pair of charmed (bottom) hadrons, which are very
similar to the loosely bound deuteron. The modern nuclear force was built upon
the chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), which is the extension of the
$\chi$PT to the systems with two matter fields. The long-range and
medium-long-range interactions between two nucleons arise from the single- and
double-pion exchange respectively, which are well constrained by the chiral
symmetry and its spontaneous breaking. The short-distance interactions can be
described by the low energy constants. Such a framework works very well for the

challenging issue. The anchor-free and keypoint-based models receive increasing
attention recently due to their effectiveness and simplicity. However, most of
these methods are vulnerable to occluded and truncated objects. In this paper,
a single-stage monocular 3D object detection model is proposed. An
instance-segmentation head is integrated into the model training, which allows
the model to be aware of the visible shape of a target object. The detection
largely avoids interference from irrelevant regions surrounding the target
objects. In addition, we also reveal that the popular IoU-based evaluation
metrics, which were originally designed for evaluating stereo or LiDAR-based
detection methods, are insensitive to the improvement of monocular 3D object
detection algorithms. A novel evaluation metric, namely average depth
similarity (ADS) is proposed for the monocular 3D object detection models. Our
method outperforms the baseline on both the popular and the proposed evaluation
metrics while maintaining real-time efficiency.

star formation, and play a key role in mass accumulation. We report JCMT POL-2
850 $\mu$m polarization observations toward the massive HFS SDC13. We detect an
organized magnetic field near the hub center with a cloud-scale ""U-shape""
morphology following the western edge of the hub. Together with larger-scale
APEX 13CO and PLANCK polarization data, we find that SDC13 is located at the
convergent point of three giant molecular clouds (GMCs) along a large-scale,
partially spiral-like magnetic field. The smaller ""U-shape"" magnetic field is
perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field and the converging GMCs. We
explain this as the result of a cloud-cloud collision. Within SDC13, we find
that local gravity and velocity gradients point toward filament ridges and hub
center. This suggests that gas can locally be pulled onto filaments and overall
converges to the hub center. A virial analysis of the central hub shows that
gravity dominates magnetic and kinematic energy. Combining large- and
small-scale analyses, we propose that SDC13 is initially formed from a
collision of clouds moving along the large-scale magnetic field. In the
post-shock regions, after the initial turbulent energy has dissipated, gravity
takes over and starts to drive the gas accretion along the filaments toward the
hub center.

vision tasks, where self-attention modules are stacked to handle input sources
like images. Intuitively, feeding multiple modalities of data to vision
transformers could improve the performance, yet the inner-modal attentive
weights may also be diluted, which could thus undermine the final performance.
In this paper, we propose a multimodal token fusion method (TokenFusion),
tailored for transformer-based vision tasks. To effectively fuse multiple
modalities, TokenFusion dynamically detects uninformative tokens and
substitutes these tokens with projected and aggregated inter-modal features.
Residual positional alignment is also adopted to enable explicit utilization of
the inter-modal alignments after fusion. The design of TokenFusion allows the
transformer to learn correlations among multimodal features, while the
single-modal transformer architecture remains largely intact. Extensive
experiments are conducted on a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous
modalities and demonstrate that TokenFusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods
in three typical vision tasks: multimodal image-to-image translation, RGB-depth
semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection with point cloud and images. Our

vary depending on their environment. We combine Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data of galaxies at 0.25<z<1.5 to
probe the impact of environment on the size-mass relation, the Main Sequence
(MS) and the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR).
  We perform a morpho-kinematic modelling of 593 [Oii] emitters in various
environments in the COSMOS area from the MUSE-gAlaxy Groups In Cosmos (MAGIC)
survey. The HST F814W images are modelled with a bulge-disk decomposition to
estimate their bulge-disk ratio, effective radius and disk inclination. We use
the [Oii]{\lambda}{\lambda}3727, 3729 doublet to extract the ionised gas
kinematic maps from the MUSE cubes, and we model them for a sample of 146 [Oii]
emitters, with bulge and disk components constrained from morphology and a dark
matter halo.
  We find an offset of 0.03 dex on the size-mass relation zero point between
the field and the large structure subsamples, with a richness threshold of N=10
to separate between small and large structures, and of 0.06 dex with N=20.
Similarly, we find a 0.1 dex difference on the MS with N=10 and 0.15 dex with
N=20. These results suggest that galaxies in massive structures are smaller by
14% and have star formation rates reduced by a factor of 1.3-1.5 with respect
to field galaxies at z=0.7. Finally, we do not find any impact of the
environment on the TFR, except when using N=20 with an offset of 0.04 dex. We
discard the effect of quenching for the largest structures that would lead to
an offset in the opposite direction. We find that, at z=0.7, if quenching
impacts the mass budget of galaxies in structures, these galaxies would have
been affected quite recently, for roughly 0.7-1.5 Gyr. This result holds when
including the gas mass, but vanishes once we include the asymmetric drift
correction.

In this paper, the two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic code FLASH is applied
to investigate and characterize the strength of laser imprint through analyzing
areal density perturbation. There are two important factors for the mitigation
of laser imprint besides the thermal smoothing of the conduction region
(between the ablation front and the critical density surface) and the mass
ablation of the ablation front. First, radiation ablation dynamically modulates
density distribution not only to increase the frequency of the perturbed
ablation front oscillation but also to decrease the amplitude of oscillation.
Second, a larger length of the shocked compression region reduces the amplitude
of the perturbed shock front oscillation. The smaller the perturbation of both
ablation front and shock front, the smaller the areal density perturbation.
Based on the above physical mechanisms, the optimal way of mitigating laser
imprint with foam is that the dynamically modulated density distribution
further reduces the amplitude of perturbation reaching the solid CH when the
areal density perturbation of foam oscillates to the first minimum value. The
optimal ranges of foam parameters to mitigate laser imprint are proposed with
the aid of dimensional analysis: the foam thickness is about 2~3 times the
perturbation wavelength, and the foam density is about 1/2~3/2 times the mass
density corresponding to the critical density.

infrastructure and are being deployed in many widely-used and safety-critical
applications. However, their integration into many systems also brings with it
the vulnerability to test time attacks in the form of Universal Adversarial
Perturbations (UAPs). UAPs are a class of perturbations that when applied to
any input causes model misclassification. Although there is an ongoing effort
to defend models against these adversarial attacks, it is often difficult to
reconcile the trade-offs in model accuracy and robustness to adversarial
attacks. Jacobian regularization has been shown to improve the robustness of
models against UAPs, whilst model ensembles have been widely adopted to improve
both predictive performance and model robustness. In this work, we propose a
novel approach, Jacobian Ensembles-a combination of Jacobian regularization and
model ensembles to significantly increase the robustness against UAPs whilst
maintaining or improving model accuracy. Our results show that Jacobian
Ensembles achieves previously unseen levels of accuracy and robustness, greatly
improving over previous methods that tend to skew towards only either accuracy
or robustness.

observationally confirmed. They are predicted to exist in low-metallicity
environments. Because overall metallicity becomes lower at higher redshifts,
deep near-infrared transient surveys probing high-redshift supernovae are
suitable to discover pair-instability supernovae. The Euclid satellite, which
is planned to be launched in 2023, has a near-infrared wide-field instrument
that is suitable for a high-redshift supernova survey. The Euclid Deep Survey
is planned to make regular observations of three Euclid Deep Fields (40 deg2 in
total) spanning the Euclid's 6 year primary mission period. While the
observations of the Euclid Deep Fields are not frequent, we show that the
predicted long duration of pair-instability supernovae would allow us to search
for high-redshift pair-instability supernovae with the Euclid Deep Survey.
Based on the current observational plan of the Euclid mission, we conduct
survey simulations in order to estimate the expected numbers of
pair-instability supernova discoveries. We find that up to several hundred
pair-instability supernovae at z < ~ 3.5 can be discovered within the Euclid
Deep Survey. We also show that pair-instability supernova candidates can be
efficiently identified by their duration and color that can be determined with
the current Euclid Deep Survey plan. We conclude that the Euclid mission can
lead to the first confirmation of pair-instability supernovae if their event
rates are as high as those predicted by recent theoretical studies. We also
update the expected numbers of superluminous supernova discoveries in the
Euclid Deep Survey based on the latest observational plan.

full spectrum of applications of strongly-lensed gravitational-wave
observations are. One application may be in the multi-messenger domain:
localisation of strongly lensed black hole mergers inside their associated lens
systems in gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) bands. This is
intriguing because combining the observations of electromagnetically detected
lens systems (via optical or infrared imaging) with their associated
strongly-lensed gravitational waves could yield a wide array of valuable,
otherwise inaccessible information. One might, for instance, independently
verify strong lensing candidates, localise black holes to sub-arcsecond
precision, study the binary-galaxy connection, and more accurately test
gravitational-wave polarisation and propagation.
  Thus, here we perform a comprehensive simulation of the projected
capabilities of LIGO-Virgo-Kagra, combined with Euclid, to find strongly lensed
gravitational-wave events and then pinpoint the location of the black-hole
merger. We find that for 20-50% of the detected events, the lens is detectable
with Euclid-like imaging. For a 1-5 deg^2 sky localisation, with Euclid-like
images of host candidates, we expect to identify the EM-counterpart for
34.6-21.9% of lensed GWs when four events are detected. For three and two
events, this drops to 29.8-14.9% and 16.4-6.6% respectively.
  A dedicated follow-up of detected lensed events with space-based instruments
in the EM and continued upgrades in the current and planned GW detectors, as
well as lensed sub-threshold search pipelines are likely crucial to the success

  Recognition","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sign language is a beautiful visual language and is also the primary language
used by speaking and hearing-impaired people. However, sign language has many
complex expressions, which are difficult for the public to understand and
master. Sign language recognition algorithms will significantly facilitate
communication between hearing-impaired people and normal people. Traditional
continuous sign language recognition often uses a sequence learning method
based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Network
(LSTM). These methods can only learn spatial and temporal features separately,
which cannot learn the complex spatial-temporal features of sign language. LSTM
is also difficult to learn long-term dependencies. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a multi-view spatial-temporal continuous sign language
recognition network. The network consists of three parts. The first part is a
Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Feature Extractor Network (MSTN), which can
directly extract the spatial-temporal features of RGB and skeleton data; the
second is a sign language encoder network based on Transformer, which can learn
long-term dependencies; the third is a Connectionist Temporal Classification
(CTC) decoder network, which is used to predict the whole meaning of the
continuous sign language. Our algorithm is tested on two public sign language
datasets SLR-100 and PHOENIX-Weather 2014T (RWTH). As a result, our method
achieves excellent performance on both datasets. The word error rate on the
SLR-100 dataset is 1.9%, and the word error rate on the RWTHPHOENIX-Weather
dataset is 22.8%.

objects or scenes in motion, which have been widely applied in immersive
telepresence, autonomous driving, surveillance, etc. However, point clouds
acquired from sensors are usually perturbed by noise, which affects downstream
tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. Although many efforts have
been made for static point cloud denoising, dynamic point cloud denoising
remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient-field-based
dynamic point cloud denoising method, exploiting the temporal correspondence
via the estimation of gradient fields -- a fundamental problem in dynamic point
cloud processing and analysis. The gradient field is the gradient of the
log-probability function of the noisy point cloud, based on which we perform
gradient ascent so as to converge each point to the underlying clean surface.
We estimate the gradient of each surface patch and exploit the temporal
correspondence, where the temporally corresponding patches are searched
leveraging on rigid motion in classical mechanics. In particular, we treat each
patch as a rigid object, which moves in the gradient field of an adjacent frame
via force until reaching a balanced state, i.e., when the sum of gradients over
the patch reaches 0. Since the gradient would be smaller when the point is
closer to the underlying surface, the balanced patch would fit the underlying
surface well, thus leading to the temporal correspondence. Finally, the
position of each point in the patch is updated along the direction of the
gradient averaged from corresponding patches in adjacent frames. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art
methods under both synthetic noise and simulated real-world noise.

feature interaction to improve their performance. However, most methods only
learn a fixed representation for each feature without considering the varying
importance of each feature under different contexts, resulting in inferior
performance. Recently, several methods tried to learn vector-level weights for
feature representations to address the fixed representation issue. However,
they only produce linear transformations to refine the fixed feature
representations, which are still not flexible enough to capture the varying
importance of each feature under different contexts. In this paper, we propose
a novel module named Feature Refinement Network (FRNet), which learns
context-aware feature representations at bit-level for each feature in
different contexts. FRNet consists of two key components: 1) Information
Extraction Unit (IEU), which captures contextual information and cross-feature
relationships to guide context-aware feature refinement; and 2) Complementary
Selection Gate (CSGate), which adaptively integrates the original and
complementary feature representations learned in IEU with bit-level weights.
Notably, FRNet is orthogonal to existing CTR methods and thus can be applied in
many existing methods to boost their performance. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted to verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility of FRNet.

Pairwise labeled data with mean opinion score (MOS) are required in training
FR-IQA model, but is time-consuming and cumbersome to collect. In contrast,
unlabeled data can be easily collected from an image degradation or restoration
process, making it encouraging to exploit unlabeled training data to boost
FR-IQA performance. Moreover, due to the distribution inconsistency between
labeled and unlabeled data, outliers may occur in unlabeled data, further
increasing the training difficulty. In this paper, we suggest to incorporate
semi-supervised and positive-unlabeled (PU) learning for exploiting unlabeled

all labeled data as positive samples, PU learning is leveraged to identify
negative samples (i.e., outliers) from unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning
(SSL) is further deployed to exploit positive unlabeled data by dynamically
generating pseudo-MOS. We adopt a dual-branch network including reference and
distortion branches. Furthermore, spatial attention is introduced in the
reference branch to concentrate more on the informative regions, and sliced
Wasserstein distance is used for robust difference map computation to address
the misalignment issues caused by images recovered by GAN models. Extensive

The optimum telescope f-ratio for a 200{\mu}m core fiber fed at f/3.5 is

blockchain systems persists despite numerous prior attempts to boost TPS. To
increase TPS without compromising security, we propose a bodyless block
propagation (BBP) scheme for which the block body is not validated and
transmitted during the block propagation process. Rather, the nodes in the
blockchain network anticipate the transactions and their ordering in the next
upcoming block so that these transactions can be pre-executed and pre-validated
before the birth of the block. It is critical, however, all nodes have a
consensus on the transaction content of the next block.
  This paper puts forth a transaction selection, ordering, and synchronization
algorithm to drive the nodes to reach such a consensus. Yet, the coinbase
address of the miner of the next block cannot be anticipated, and therefore
transactions that depend on the coinbase address cannot be pre-executed and
pre-validated. This paper further puts forth an algorithm to deal with such
unresolvable transactions for an overall consistent and TPS-efficient scheme.
With our scheme, most transactions do not need to be validated and transmitted
during block propagation, ridding the dependence of propagation time on the
number of transactions in the block, and making the system fully TPS scalable.
Experimental results show that our protocol can reduce propagation time by 4x
with respect to the current Ethereum blockchain, and its TPS performance is
limited by the node hardware performance rather than block propagation.

predicting socially plausible trajectories with relational reasoning. To

and has marked the state of the art performance for many machine learning
tasks. Among them, time-series modeling with neural controlled differential
equations (NCDEs) is considered as a breakthrough. In many cases, NCDE-based
models not only provide better accuracy than recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
but also make it possible to process irregular time-series. In this work, we
enhance NCDEs by redesigning their core part, i.e., generating a continuous
path from a discrete time-series input. NCDEs typically use interpolation
algorithms to convert discrete time-series samples to continuous paths.
However, we propose to i) generate another latent continuous path using an
encoder-decoder architecture, which corresponds to the interpolation process of
NCDEs, i.e., our neural network-based interpolation vs. the existing explicit
interpolation, and ii) exploit the generative characteristic of the decoder,
i.e., extrapolation beyond the time domain of original data if needed.
Therefore, our NCDE design can use both the interpolated and the extrapolated
information for downstream machine learning tasks. In our experiments with 5
real-world datasets and 12 baselines, our extrapolation and interpolation-based
NCDEs outperform existing baselines by non-trivial margins.

to obtain high-resolution images of the subsurface. However, LSRTM needs an
accurate velocity model similar to other migration methods. Otherwise, it
suffers from depth estimation errors and out of focus images. Moreover, LSRTM
is computationally expensive and it can suffer from multiple reflections.
Recently, a target-oriented approach to LSRTM has been proposed, which focuses
the wavefield above the target of interest. Remarkably, this approach can be
helpful for imaging below complex overburdens and subsalt domains. Moreover,
this approach can significantly reduce the computational burden of the problem
by limiting the computational domain to a smaller area. Nevertheless,
target-oriented LSRTM still needs an accurate velocity model of the overburden
to focus the wavefield accurately and predict internal multiple reflections
correctly. In recent years, Marchenko redatuming has emerged as a novel
data-driven method that can predict Green's functions at any arbitrary depth,
including all orders of multiples. The only requirement for this method is a
smooth background velocity model of the overburden. Moreover, with Marchenko
double-focusing, one can make virtual sources and receivers at a boundary above
the target and bypass the overburden. This paper proposes a new algorithm for
target-oriented LSRTM, which fits the double-focused data with modeled data at
a boundary above the target of interest. Consequently, our target-oriented
LSRTM algorithm correctly accounts for all orders of overburden-related
multiples, resulting in a significant reduction of the artifacts caused by
overburden internal multiple reflections in the target image compared to
conventional LSRTM.

so-called classical devices used nowadays. Understanding what features are
inherently non-classical is crucial for reaching better-than-classical
performance. This thesis focuses on two nonclassical behaviours: quantum
contextuality and Wigner negativity. The former is a notion superseding
nonlocality that can be exhibited by quantum systems. To date, it has mostly
been studied in discrete-variable scenarios. In those scenarios, contextuality
has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for advantages in some cases. On
the other hand, negativity of the Wigner function is another unsettling
non-classical feature of quantum states that originates from phase-space
formulation in continuous-variable quantum optics. Continuous-variable
scenarios offer promising candidates for implementing quantum computations.
Wigner negativity is known to be a necessary resource for quantum speedup with
continuous variables. However contextuality has been little understood and
studied in continuous-variable scenarios.
  We first set out a robust framework for properly treating contextuality in
continuous variables. We also quantify contextuality in such scenarios by using
tools from infinite-dimensional optimisation theory. Building upon this, we
show that Wigner negativity is equivalent to contextuality in continuous
variables with respect to Pauli measurements thus establishing a
continuous-variable analogue of a celebrated result by Howard et al. We then
introduce experimentally-friendly witnesses for Wigner negativity of single
mode and multimode quantum states, based on fidelities with Fock states, using
again tools from infinite-dimensional optimisation theory. We further extend
the range of previously known discrete-variable results linking contextuality
and advantage into a new territory of information retrieval.

states by programmable linear optics. Two types of schemes generating the
states from four single photons, which is the minimal possible to accomplish
the task, have been considered. The schemes have different detection patterns
heralding successful generation events, namely, one-mode heralding, in which
the two auxiliary photons are detected in one mode, and two-mode heralding, in
which single photons are detected in each of the two modes simultaneously. We
have shown that the dependence of the schemes' success probabilities on the
target state's degree of entanglement are essentially different. In particular,
one-mode heralding yields better efficiency for highly-entangled states, if the
programmable interferometers can explore the full space of the unitary transfer
matrices,. It is reversed in case of weakly-entangled states where two-mode
heralding is better. We have found a minimal decomposition of the scheme with
two-mode heralding that is programmed by one variable phase shift. We infer
that the linear optical schemes designed specifically for generation of
two-qubit states are more efficient than schemes implementing gate-based
circuits with known two-qubit linear optical gates. Our results yield
substantial reduction of physical resources needed to generate two-qubit
dual-rail-encoded photonic states.

task in computer-aided orthodontic surgical planning. The state-of-the-art deep
learning-based methods often simply concatenate the raw geometric attributes
(i.e., coordinates and normal vectors) of mesh cells to train a single-stream
network for automatic intra-oral scanner image segmentation. However, since
different raw attributes reveal completely different geometric information, the
naive concatenation of different raw attributes at the (low-level) input stage
may bring unnecessary confusion in describing and differentiating between mesh
cells, thus hampering the learning of high-level geometric representations for
the segmentation task. To address this issue, we design a two-stream graph
convolutional network (i.e., TSGCN), which can effectively handle inter-view
confusion between different raw attributes to more effectively fuse their
complementary information and learn discriminative multi-view geometric
representations. Specifically, our TSGCN adopts two input-specific
graph-learning streams to extract complementary high-level geometric
representations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. Then, these
single-view representations are further fused by a self-attention module to
adaptively balance the contributions of different views in learning more
discriminative multi-view representations for accurate and fully automatic
tooth segmentation. We have evaluated our TSGCN on a real-patient dataset of
dental (mesh) models acquired by 3D intraoral scanners. Experimental results
show that our TSGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D

deposition (CVD) technique. The study shows that the strain as well as the
physisorption of air molecules at the sulfur vacancy ($V_S$) sites play key
roles in governing the optical quality of CVD grown 1L-MoS$_2$. Removal of air
molecules from the $V_S$ sites enhances the relative strength of the
A-exciton/trion transition as compared to the broad luminescence (BL) band
arising from those defects at low temperatures. It has also been found that
such removal helps in improving the valley polarization property of the film.
Relaxation of biaxial tensile strain, which has been achieved by post growth
transferring of 1L-MoS$_2$ film from the sapphire to a SiO$_2$/Si substrate by
a polystyrene assisted transfer process, is also found to be helpful to get
back the high polarization character ($\sim$80%) of the valleys. The study
further shows that the transfer process not only facilitates the removal of
physisorbed air molecules from the $V_S$ sites but also puts in place a long
lasting capping layer on MoS$_2$ that shields the film from reacting with air
and hence enhances the relative yield of A-exciton/trion transition by
suppressing the BL transition. The study thus creates an opportunity to use CVD

the inferred wind density by more than an order of magnitude. The derived

natural deficiency for GNN-based KGR models, that is, the sparse supervised
signal problem, which may make their actual performance drop to some extent.
Inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in mining supervised
signals from data itself, in this paper, we focus on exploring the contrastive
learning in KG-aware recommendation and propose a novel multi-level cross-view
contrastive learning mechanism, named MCCLK. Different from traditional
contrastive learning methods which generate two graph views by uniform data
augmentation schemes such as corruption or dropping, we comprehensively
consider three different graph views for KG-aware recommendation, including
global-level structural view, local-level collaborative and semantic views.
Specifically, we consider the user-item graph as a collaborative view, the
item-entity graph as a semantic view, and the user-item-entity graph as a
structural view. MCCLK hence performs contrastive learning across three views
on both local and global levels, mining comprehensive graph feature and
structure information in a self-supervised manner. Besides, in semantic view, a
k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) item-item semantic graph construction module is
proposed, to capture the important item-item semantic relation which is usually
ignored by previous work. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark
datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method over the
state-of-the-arts. The implementations are available at:

predictions on an unlabeled target domain by utilizing the supervised model
trained on a labeled source domain. In this work, we propose Semantic-Guided
Pixel Contrast (SePiCo), a novel one-stage adaptation framework that highlights
the semantic concepts of individual pixels to promote learning of
class-discriminative and class-balanced pixel representations across domains,
eventually boosting the performance of self-training methods. Specifically, to
explore proper semantic concepts, we first investigate a centroid-aware pixel
contrast that employs the category centroids of the entire source domain or a
single source image to guide the learning of discriminative features.
Considering the possible lack of category diversity in semantic concepts, we
then blaze a trail of distributional perspective to involve a sufficient
quantity of instances, namely distribution-aware pixel contrast, in which we
approximate the true distribution of each semantic category from the statistics
of labeled source data. Moreover, such an optimization objective can derive a
closed-form upper bound by implicitly involving an infinite number of
(dis)similar pairs, making it computationally efficient. Extensive experiments
show that SePiCo not only helps stabilize training but also yields
discriminative representations, making significant progress on both
synthetic-to-real and daytime-to-nighttime adaptation scenarios.

be answered accurately using a fixed dataset while avoiding false discoveries
(statistically inaccurate answers). In this paper, we tackle a question that
precedes the field of study: Is data only valuable when it provides accurate
answers to statistical queries? To answer this question, we use Stochastic
Convex Optimization as a case study.
  In this model, algorithms are considered as analysts who query an estimate of
the gradient of a noisy function at each iteration and move towards its
minimizer. It is known that $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ examples can be used to minimize
the objective function, but none of the existing methods depend on the accuracy
of the estimated gradients along the trajectory. Therefore, we ask: How many
samples are needed to minimize a noisy convex function if we require
$\epsilon$-accurate estimates of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ gradients? Or, might it be
that inaccurate gradient estimates are \emph{necessary} for finding the minimum
of a stochastic convex function at an optimal statistical rate?
  We provide two partial answers to this question. First, we show that a
general analyst (queries that may be maliciously chosen) requires
$\Omega(1/\epsilon^3)$ samples, ruling out the possibility of a foolproof
mechanism. Second, we show that, under certain assumptions on the oracle,
$\tilde \Omega(1/\epsilon^{2.5})$ samples are necessary for gradient descent to
interact with the oracle. Our results are in contrast to classical bounds that
show that $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples can optimize the population risk to an
accuracy of $O(\epsilon)$, but with spurious gradients.

provides additional regularisation and outperforms the baseline test accuracy.
However, in contrast to model performance metrics reported on computer science
benchmarking data-sets, we find that improvement is limited to a narrow range

Additionally, we show that SSL does not improve model calibration, regardless
of whether classification is improved. Moreover, we find that when different
underlying catalogues drawn from the same radio survey are used to provide the
labelled and unlabelled data-sets required for SSL, a significant drop in
classification performance is observered, highlighting the difficulty of
applying SSL techniques under dataset shift. We show that a class-imbalanced
unlabelled data pool negatively affects performance through prior probability
shift, which we suggest may explain this performance drop, and that using the
Frechet Distance between labelled and unlabelled data-sets as a measure of
data-set shift can provide a prediction of model performance, but that for

for autonomous driving, their robustness to varying weather conditions still
requires attention. When adapting these models for changed environments, such
as different weather conditions, they are prone to forgetting previously
learned information. This catastrophic forgetting is typically addressed via
incremental learning approaches which usually re-train the model by either
keeping a memory bank of training samples or keeping a copy of the entire model
or model parameters for each scenario. While these approaches show impressive
results, they can be prone to scalability issues and their applicability for
autonomous driving in all weather conditions has not been shown. In this paper
we propose DISC -- Domain Incremental through Statistical Correction -- a
simple online zero-forgetting approach which can incrementally learn new tasks
(i.e weather conditions) without requiring re-training or expensive memory
banks. The only information we store for each task are the statistical
parameters as we categorize each domain by the change in first and second order
statistics. Thus, as each task arrives, we simply 'plug and play' the
statistical vectors for the corresponding task into the model and it
immediately starts to perform well on that task. We show the efficacy of our
approach by testing it for object detection in a challenging domain-incremental
autonomous driving scenario where we encounter different adverse weather
conditions, such as heavy rain, fog, and snow.

many interesting effects, the precise role of the photon-photon interaction is
not fully clarified up to now. In view of this, it is advantageous that these
systems allow measuring both the intensity of the light leaking out of the
cavity and its spectrum at the same time. Therefore, the photon-photon
interaction strength can be determined once via analysing the condensate
broadening and once via examining the interaction-induced modifications of the
cavity modes. As the former method depends crucially on the concrete shape of
the trapping potential and the spatial resolution of the used camera,
interferometric methods promise more precise measurements. To this end, the
present paper works out the impact of the photon-photon interaction upon the
cavity modes. A quantum mechanical description of the photon-photon
interaction, including the thermal cloud, builds the theoretical backbone of
the method. An exact diagonalisation approach introduced here exposes how the
effective photon-photon interaction modifies both the spectrum and the width of
the photon gas. A comparison with a variational approach based on the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation quantifies the contribution of the thermal cloud in
the respective applications.

unorthodox form of the rotational matrix $R = e^{i{\bf A}} \,\,\,(e^{{\bf A}})$
in the Casas-Ibarra parametrisation. This particular structure of $R$ turns out
to be an artefact in explaining the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe
in a pure ISS scenario. We detail here the confined regions of the $R$ matrix
parameter space, essential for a successful leptogenesis. The $R$-matrix
parameter space assists in rescuing the ISS parameter space needed for
successful leptogenesis. This finding is otherwise unprecedented in the ISS set
up. Making use of the resulted $R$ matrix parameter space we have calculated
the branching ratio for the LFV decay $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$. This accounts
for an indirect probe of the $R$-matrix parameter space. The branching ratio
obtained from the leptogenesis parameter space surpasses the existing bound on
the branching ratio that resulted in a scenario of combined effect of linear
and inverse seesaw. We also report here that, for $R = e^{i{\bf A}}$ choice
leptogenesis demands the Dirac CP phase ($\delta$) to oscillate around $\pi/2$,

embedded protoplanets in a large number disks. The primordial configurations of
these planetary systems can be deduced from the morphology of the disk
substructure and serve as initial conditions for numerical investigation of
their future evolution. Starting from the initial configurations of 12
multi-planetary systems deduced from ALMA disks, we carried out two-stage
N-body simulation to investigate the evolution of the planetary systems at the
disk stage as well as the long term orbital stability after the disk dispersal.
At the disk stage, our simulation includes both the orbital migration and
pebble/gas accretion effects. We found a variety of planetary systems are
produced and can be categorised into distant giant planets, Jupiter-like
planets, Neptune-like planets and distant small planets. We found the disk
stage evolution as well as the final configurations are sensitive to both the
initial mass assignments and viscosity. After the disk stage, we implement only
mutual gravity between star and planets and introduce stochastic perturbative
forces. All systems are integrated for up to 10 Gyr to test their orbital
stability. Most planetary systems are found to be stable for at least 10 Gyr
with perturbative force in a reasonable range. Our result implies that a strong
perturbation source such as stellar flybys is required to drive the planetary
system unstable. We discuss the implications of our results on both the disk
and planet observation, which may be confirmed by the next generation
telescopes such as JWST and ngVLA.

existence of such macroscopically LIOMs, we explore and study some of their
structural properties across the MBL transition. We first, consider a
one-dimensional XXZ spin chain in a disordered magnetic field and introduce and
implement a non-perturbative, fast, and accurate method of constructing LIOMs.
In contrast to already existing methods, our scheme allows obtaining LIOMs not
only in the deep MBL phase but rather, near the transition point too. Then, we
take the matrix representation of LIOM operators as an adjacency matrix of a
directed graph whose elements describe the connectivity of ordered eigenbasis
in the Hilbert-space. Our cluster size analysis for this graph shows that the
MBL transition coincides with a percolation transition in the Hilbert-space. By
performing finite-size scaling, we compare the critical disorder and
correlation exponent $\nu$ both in the presence and absence of interaction.
Finally, we also discuss how the distribution of diagonal elements of LIOM
operators in a typical cluster signals the transition.

years. At the core is to model the rumor characteristics inherent in rich
information, such as propagation patterns in social network and semantic
patterns in post content, and differentiate them from the truth. However,
existing works on rumor detection fall short in modeling heterogeneous
information, either using one single information source only (e.g. social
network, or post content) or ignoring the relations among multiple sources
(e.g. fusing social and content features via simple concatenation). Therefore,
they possibly have drawbacks in comprehensively understanding the rumors, and
detecting them accurately. In this work, we explore contrastive self-supervised
learning on heterogeneous information sources, so as to reveal their relations
and characterize rumors better. Technically, we supplement the main supervised
task of detection with an auxiliary self-supervised task, which enriches post
representations via post self-discrimination. Specifically, given two
heterogeneous views of a post (i.e. representations encoding social patterns
and semantic patterns), the discrimination is done by maximizing the mutual
information between different views of the same post compared to that of other
posts. We devise cluster-wise and instance-wise approaches to generate the
views and conduct the discrimination, considering different relations of
information sources. We term this framework as Self-supervised Rumor Detection
(SRD). Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the
effectiveness of SRD for automatic rumor detection on social media.

individual flows, causing hardly measurable overhead while at the same time
protecting the system from overload conditions. Our IP stack adaption is able
to reduce the low-priority packet processing time by over 86% compared to an

higher general traffic load before disabling the receive IRQ as a last resort

solar atmosphere. While numerical resolution fundamentally limits their
inclusion in MHD simulations, real observations at the same nominal resolution
should still contain imprints of sub-resolution effects. This means that the
synthetic observables from a simulation of given resolution might not be
directly comparable to real observables at the same resolution. It is thus of
interest to investigate how inferences based on synthetic spectra from
simulations with different numerical resolutions compare, and whether these
differences persist after the spectra have been spatially degraded to a common
resolution. We aim to compare synthetic spectra obtained from realistic 3D
radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) simulations run at three different
numerical resolutions from the same initial atmosphere, using very simple
methods for inferring line-of-sight velocities and magnetic fields.
Additionally we examine how the differing spatial resolution impacts the
results retrieved from the STiC inversion code. We find that while the simple
inferences for all three simulations reveal the same large-scale tendencies,
the higher resolutions yield more fine-grained structures and more extreme
line-of-sight velocities/magnetic fields in concentrated spots even after
spatial smearing. We also see indications that the imprints of sub-resolution
effects on the degraded spectra result in systematic errors in the inversions,
and that these errors increase with the amount of sub-resolution effects
included. Fortunately, however, we find that including successively more
sub-resolution yields smaller additional effects; i.e. there is a clear trend
of diminishing importance for progressively finer sub-resolution effects.

enhance lateral diffusion during collisions; in the other, it is a result of a
nearest-neighbour attractive/repulsive interaction between particles of the

carefully corrected for the gamma-gamma interaction with photons of the

redshift-dependent opacity effect. Then, the corrected spectra are fitted with
simple power-laws to infer the intrinsic spectral indices $\Gamma_{\rm em}$ at
VHE, to test the assumption that such spectral properties are set by the local
rather than the global cosmological environment. We find some systematic
anti-correlations with redshift of $\Gamma_{\rm em}$ that might indicate,
although with low-significance, a spectral anomaly potentially requiring a
revision of the photon propagation process. More conclusive tests with higher
statistical significance will require the observational improvements offered by
the forthcoming new generation of Cherenkov arrays (CTA, ASTRI, LHAASO).

successfully design a 2D PhC that possesses the EPs with nonzero eigenvalue
winding numbers. The spectral area along a specific wavevector direction is
then formed by leveraging the symmetry of the macroscopic geometry and the unit
cell. The projected-band-structure calculations are performed to demonstrate
that the desired skin effect exists at the specific crystalline interfaces. We
finally employ time-domain simulations to vividly illustrate this phenomenon by
exciting a pulse at the center of a finite-sized PhC. Our results form a solid

candidates if some additional criteria are satisfied. We catalogue
$S_3$-symmetric three-Higgs-doublet models, also allowing for softly broken
$S_3$-symmetric scalar potential terms, based on whether a specific model could
possibly accommodate a dark matter candidate. The variety of the
$S_3$-symmetric family models arises due to different possibilities to arrange
vacuum expectation values. Such models can have vacua with one or two vanishing
vacuum expectation values. In our study we assume that the dark matter
candidate is stabilised by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry is a remnant of $S_3$ symmetry which survived spontaneous symmetry
breaking, and not superimposed over $S_3$. We explore two models; with an
without CP violation. These models have a single dark and two active scalar
sectors. The active sectors behave in many aspects like a Type-I
two-Higgs-doublet model. The dark matter candidate masses, in two cases, are
different from the known (previously studied) models with three scalar

practical video settings even labelling a few examples appears unrealistic.
This is especially true as the level of details in spatio-temporal video
understanding and with it, the complexity of annotations continues to increase.
Rather than performing few-shot learning with a human oracle to provide a few
densely labelled support videos, we propose to automatically learn to find
appropriate support videos given a query. We call this self-shot learning and
we outline a simple self-supervised learning method to generate an embedding
space well-suited for unsupervised retrieval of relevant samples. To showcase
this novel setting, we tackle, for the first time, video instance segmentation
in a self-shot (and few-shot) setting, where the goal is to segment instances
at the pixel-level across the spatial and temporal domains. We provide strong
baseline performances that utilize a novel transformer-based model and show
that self-shot learning can even surpass few-shot and can be positively
combined for further performance gains. Experiments on new benchmarks show that
our approach achieves strong performance, is competitive to oracle support in
some settings, scales to large unlabelled video collections, and can be
combined in a semi-supervised setting.

Subsequent electric circuit modeling of the electrical impedance results the
capacitive properties of the barrier next to the well-known transepithelial
electrical resistance (TEER). The versatility of the new method was analyzed by
the EIS analysis of a Caco-2 monolayer in response to (a) different membrane
coating materials, (b) two different permeability enhancers ethylene
glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and saponin,
and (c) sonoporation. For the different membrane coating materials, the TEERs
of the standard and new protocol coincide and increase during cultivation,
while the capacitance shows a distinct maximum for three different surface
materials (no coating, Matrigel, and collagen I). The permeability enhancers
cause a decline in the TEER value, but only saponin alters the capacitance of
the cell layer by two orders of magnitude. Hence, cell layer capacitance and
TEER represent two independent properties characterizing the monolayer. The use
of commercial chopstick-like electrodes to access the impedance of a barrier
cultivated in transwell inserts enables remarkable insight into the behavior of
the cellular barrier with no extra work for the researcher. This simple method
could evolve into a standard protocol used in cell barrier research.

Less studied has been the question of consistency, of. whether two examinations
of the same bullets or cartridge cases come to the same conclusion, carried out
by an examiner on separate occasions -- intrarater reliability or repeatability
-- or by two examiners -- interrater reliability or reproducibility. One
important study, described in a 2020 Report by the Ames Laboratory-USDOE to the

investigate firearms examination repeatability and reproducibility. The
Report's conclusions were paradoxical. The observed agreement of examiners with

concluded repeatability and reproducibility are satisfactory, on grounds that
the observed agreement exceeds a quantity called the expected agreement. We
find that appropriately employing expected agreement as it was intended does
not suggest satisfactory repeatability and reproducibility, but the opposite.

to a reduced potential drop. Together with a more homogeneous electric field
across the feed water section, this can compensate for the reduction of contact

element increases manufacturing complexity while improving mass transport in
general, yet accepting their known disadvantages such as less transport in dead

commercially available spacer geometries. Here, we present a methodology to
design an industrially relevant mini-module with an optimized built-in 3D
spacer structure in a flat-sheet ultrafiltration membrane module to eliminate
the spacer as a separate part. Therefore, the built-in structures have been
conceptually implemented through an in-silico design in compliance with the

investigated in a digital twin of the mini-module by 3D-CFD simulations to
select two options, which were then compared to the empty feed channel
regarding mass transfer. Subsequently, the simulated flux increase was
experimentally verified during bovine serum albumin (BSA) filtration. The new

up to 30% higher permeation rates. The origin of these improvements is
correlated to the flow characteristics inside the mini-module as visualized

promising technology for brine treatment and salt recovery. Additionally, a
reduction of the energy demand by more than 70% is demonstrated by introducing

constrained by several frequency-dependent physical mechanisms. Recent works
have developed several mathematical formulations to understand these mechanisms
and predict the optimal operating conditions. However, existing approaches rely
on simplified body models, which are unable to capture important aspects of
wireless power transfer. Therefore, this paper proposes the efficiency analysis
approach in anatomical models that can provide insightful information on
achieving the optimum operation conditions. First, this approach is validated
with a theoretical spherical wave expansion analysis, and the results for a
simplified spherical model and a human pectoral model are compared. The results
show that although a magnetic receiver outperforms an electric one for
near-field operation and both sources could be equally employed in far-field
range, it is in mid-field that the maximum efficiency is achieved with an
optimum frequency between 1-5 GHz depending on the implantation depth. The
receiver orientation is another factor that affects the efficiency, with a
maximum difference between the best and worst-case scenarios around five times
for the electric source and over 13 times for the magnetic one. This approach
is used to analyze the case of a deep-implanted pacemaker wirelessly powered by
an on-body transmitter and subjected to stochastic misalignments. We evaluate
the efficiency and exposure, and we demonstrate how a buffered transmitter can
be tailored to achieve maximum powering efficiency. Finally, design guidelines
that lead to optimal implantable wireless power transfer systems are
established from the results obtained with the proposed approach.

  Communications",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Task-oriented communication is a new paradigm that aims at providing
efficient connectivity for accomplishing intelligent tasks rather than the
reception of every transmitted bit. In this paper, a deep learning-based
task-oriented communication architecture is proposed where the user extracts,
compresses and transmits semantics in an end-to-end (E2E) manner. Furthermore,
an approach is proposed to compress the semantics according to their importance
relevant to the task, namely, adaptable semantic compression (ASC). Assuming a
delay-intolerant system, supporting multiple users indicates a problem that
executing with the higher compression ratio requires fewer channel resources
but leads to the distortion of semantics, while executing with the lower
compression ratio requires more channel resources and thus may lead to a
transmission failure due to delay constraint. To solve the problem, both
compression ratio and resource allocation are optimized for the task-oriented
communication system to maximize the success probability of tasks.
Specifically, due to the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a compression
ratio and resource allocation (CRRA) algorithm by separating the problem into
two subproblems and solving iteratively to obtain the convergent solution.
Furthermore, considering the scenarios where users have various service levels,
a compression ratio, resource allocation, and user selection (CRRAUS) algorithm
is proposed to deal with the problem. In CRRAUS, users are adaptively selected
to complete the corresponding intelligent tasks based on branch and bound
method at the expense of higher algorithm complexity compared with CRRA.
Simulation results show that the proposed CRRA and CRRAUS algorithms can obtain
at least 15% and 10% success gains over baseline algorithms, respectively.

crucial for the CoSOD task. In this paper, we propose a global-and-local
collaborative learning architecture, which includes a global correspondence
modeling (GCM) and a local correspondence modeling (LCM) to capture
comprehensive inter-image corresponding relationship among different images
from the global and local perspectives. Firstly, we treat different images as
different time slices and use 3D convolution to integrate all intra features
intuitively, which can more fully extract the global group semantics. Secondly,
we design a pairwise correlation transformation (PCT) to explore similarity
correspondence between pairwise images and combine the multiple local pairwise
correspondences to generate the local inter-image relationship. Thirdly, the
inter-image relationships of the GCM and LCM are integrated through a
global-and-local correspondence aggregation (GLA) module to explore more
comprehensive inter-image collaboration cues. Finally, the intra- and
inter-features are adaptively integrated by an intra-and-inter weighting fusion
(AEWF) module to learn co-saliency features and predict the co-saliency map.
The proposed GLNet is evaluated on three prevailing CoSOD benchmark datasets,
demonstrating that our model trained on a small dataset (about 3k images) still
outperforms eleven state-of-the-art competitors trained on some large datasets

stellar masses of galaxies in them. We found the masses and radii of the

of local superclusters. We determined eight HDCs in the BGW superclusters. The
masses of their turnaround regions are in the range of $M_{\mathrm{T}} \approx
0.4 - 3.3\times~10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot,$ and radii are in the range of

between individual cores in superclusters are much larger: of the order of $25

the HDCs of the richest superclusters in the local Universe. The BGW
superclusters will probably evolve to several poorer superclusters with masses
similar to those of the local superclusters. This may weaken the tension with
the $\Lambda$CDM model, which does not predict a large number of very rich and
large superclusters in our local cosmic neighbourhood, and explains why there
are no superclusters as elongated as those in the BGW in the local Universe.

reactions. The Gibbs free energy in such cases was found to be as low as
$-$0.02 eV which is quite superior as compared to other materials reported in
literature. The concept presented herein can be extended to other well known 2D
TI and used to realise novel topological quantum catalysts for ultra-high

functions (eVDF) observed in the solar wind generally present enhanced tails
and field-aligned skewness. These properties may induce the excitation of
electromagnetic perturbations through the whistler heat-flux instability
(WHFI), that may contribute to a non-collisional regulation of the electron
heat-flux values observed in the solar wind via wave-particle interactions.
Recently, a new way to model the solar wind eVDF has been proposed: the
core-strahlo model. This representation consist in a bi-Maxwellian core plus a
Skew-Kappa distribution, representing the halo and strahl electrons as a single
skewed distribution. The core-strahlo model is able to reproduce the main
features of the eVDF in the solar wind (thermal core, enhanced tails, and
skewness), with the advantage that the asymmetry is controlled by only one
parameter. In this work we use linear kinetic theory to analyze the effect of
solar wind electrons described by the core-strahlo model, over the excitation
of the parallel propagating WHFI. We use parameters relevant to the solar wind
and focus our attention on the effect on the linear stability introduced by
different values of the core-to-strahlo density and temperature ratios, which
are known to vary throughout the Heliosphere. We also obtain the stability
threshold for this instability as a function of the electron beta and the
skewness parameter, which is a better indicator of instability than the
heat-flux macroscopic moment, and present a threshold conditions for the
instability that can be compared with observational data.

propose to `imagine` diverse counterparts of given exemplars referring to the
abundant semantic-irrelevant information from unlabeled data. Specifically, we
develop a learnable feature generator to diversify exemplars by adaptively
generating diverse counterparts of exemplars based on semantic information from
exemplars and semantically-irrelevant information from unlabeled data. We
introduce semantic contrastive learning to enforce the generated samples to be
semantic consistent with exemplars and perform semanticdecoupling contrastive
learning to encourage diversity of generated samples. The diverse generated

manifests itself when one considers the contribution of quantum fluctuations of

contribution of zero-point energy exceeds by many orders of magnitude the
observational cosmological upper bound on the energy density of the universe.
Therefore it seems natural to expect that vacuum fluctuations of the
fundamental fields would influence the cosmological evolution in any way. Our
aim in this review article is to describe a recent investigation of the
influence of the Yang-Mills vacuum polarisation and of the chromomagnetic
condensation on the evolution of Friedmann cosmology, on inflation and on
primordial gravitational waves. We derive the quantum energy-momentum tensor
and the corresponding quantum equation of state for gauge field theory using
the effective Lagrangian approach. The energy-momentum tensor has a term
proportional to the space-time metric and provides a finite non-diverging
contribution to the effective cosmological constant. This allows to investigate
the influence of the gauge field theory vacuum polarisation on the evolution of
Friedmann cosmology, inflation and primordial gravitational waves. The Type
I-IV solutions of the Friedmann equations induced by the gauge field theory
vacuum polarisation provide an alternative inflationary mechanism and a
possibility for late-time acceleration. The Type II solution of the Friedmann
equations generates the initial exponential expansion of the universe of finite
duration and the Type IV solution demonstrates late-time acceleration. The
solutions fulfil the necessary conditions for the amplification of primordial
gravitational waves.

Sinophobic slurs has significantly increased even with the hate-speech ban

remain the same in the pandemic period. We further use topic modeling to show
the topics of Sinophobic discussion are pretty diverse and broad. We find that
both Web communities share some common Sinophobic topics like ethnics,
economics and commerce, weapons and military, foreign relations, etc. However,
compared to 4chan's /pol/, more daily life-related topics including food, game,

ones into monochromatic combinatorial rectangles. A matrix $M$ is called $(k_1,
\ldots, k_m ; n_1, \ldots, n_m)$ circulant block diagonal if it is a block
matrix with $m$ diagonal blocks, such that for each $i \in [m]$, the $i$th
diagonal block of $M$ is the circulant matrix whose first row has $k_i$ ones
followed by $n_i-k_i$ zeros, and all of whose other entries are zeros. In this
work, we study the binary rank of these matrices and of their complement. In
particular, we compare the binary rank of these matrices to their rank over the
reals, which forms a lower bound on the former.
  We present a general method for proving upper bounds on the binary rank of
block matrices that have diagonal blocks of some specified structure and ones
elsewhere. Using this method, we prove that the binary rank of the complement
of a $(k_1, \ldots, k_m ; n_1, \ldots, n_m)$ circulant block diagonal matrix
for integers satisfying $n_i>k_i>0$ for each $i \in [m]$ exceeds its real rank
by no more than the maximum of $\gcd(n_i,k_i)-1$ over all $i \in [m]$. We
further present several sufficient conditions for the binary rank of these
matrices to strictly exceed their real rank. By combining the upper and lower
bounds, we determine the exact binary rank of various families of matrices and,
in addition, significantly generalize a result of Gregory.
  Motivated by a question of Pullman, we study the binary rank of $k$-regular
$0,1$ matrices and of their complement. As an application of our results on
circulant block diagonal matrices, we show that for every $k \geq 2$, there
exist $k$-regular $0,1$ matrices whose binary rank is strictly larger than that
of their complement. Furthermore, we exactly determine for every integer $r$,
the smallest possible binary rank of the complement of a $2$-regular $0,1$
matrix with binary rank $r$.

deterministic memory access patterns of such networks into cognizance (albeit
partially), group a set of memory blocks into a tile, and maintain state at the
level of tiles (to reduce storage space). For providing integrity guarantees

maintain block-level state.

This reduces the storage space, reduces the number of memory accesses,
increases performance, and simplifies the design without sacrificing any

this puzzling feature stems from solute exchanges with the surrounding fluid

flows resulting from these solutes' gradients. Contrary to asymmetric active
colloids, these isotropic droplets swim spontaneously by exploiting the
nonlinear coupling of solute transport with self-generated Marangoni flows,
which is also responsible for secondary transitions to more complex individual
and collective dynamics. Thanks to their simple design and their sensitivity to
physico-chemical signals, they are fascinating physicists, chemists, biologists

large-scale medical dataset that is fully labeled for all classes of interest.
Instead, it would be convenient to collect multiple small partially labeled
datasets from different matching sources, where the medical images may have
only been annotated for a subset of classes of interest. This paper offers an
empirical understanding of an under-explored problem, namely partially
supervised multi-label classification (PSMLC), where a multi-label classifier
is trained with only partially labeled medical images. In contrast to the fully
supervised counterpart, the partial supervision caused by medical data scarcity
has non-trivial negative impacts on the model performance. A potential remedy
could be augmenting the partial labels. Though vicinal risk minimization (VRM)
has been a promising solution to improve the generalization ability of the
model, its application to PSMLC remains an open question. To bridge the
methodological gap, we provide the first VRM-based solution to PSMLC. The
empirical results also provide insights into future research directions on
partially supervised learning under data scarcity.

  Part1. Channel flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a generalized hydrodynamic stability theory for interacting
particles in polydisperse particle-laden flows. The addition of dispersed
particulate matter to a clean flow can either stabilize or destabilize the
flow, depending on the particles' relaxation time-scale relative to the carrier
flow time scales and the particle loading. To study the effects of
polydispersity and particle interactions on the hydrodynamic stability of shear
flows, we propose a new mathematical framework by combining a linear stability
analysis and a discrete Eulerian sectional formulation to describe the flow and
the dispersed particulate matter. In this formulation, multiple momentum and
transport equations are written for each size-section of the dispersed phase,
where interphase and inter-particle mass and momentum transfer are modelled as
source terms in the governing equations. A new modal linear stability framework
is derived by linearizing the coupled equations. Using this approach,
particle-flow interactions, such as polydispersity, droplet vaporization,
condensation, and coalescence, may be modelled. The method is validated with
linear stability analyses of clean and monodisperse particle-laden flows. We
show that the stability characteristics of a channel flow laden with particles
drastically change due to polydispersity. While relatively large monodisperse
particles tend to stabilize the flow, adding a second size section of a very
small mass fraction of low-to-moderate Stokes number particles may
significantly increase the growth rates, and for high-Reynolds numbers may
destabilize flows that might have been regarded as linearly stable in the
monodisperse case. These findings may apply to a vast number of fluid mechanics
applications involving particle-laden flows such as atmospheric flows,
environmental flows, medical applications, propulsion, and energy systems.

been proposed to utilize textual data from social media for anti-social
behavior analysis like cyberbullying, fake news detection, and identification
of hate speech mainly for highly-resourced languages such as English. However,
despite having a lot of diversity and millions of native speakers, some
languages like Bengali are under-resourced, which is due to a lack of
computational resources for natural language processing (NLP). Similar to other
languages, Bengali social media contents also include images along with texts
(e.g., multimodal memes are posted by embedding short texts into images on
Facebook). Therefore, only the textual data is not enough to judge them since
images might give extra context to make a proper judgement. This paper is about
hate speech detection from multimodal Bengali memes and texts. We prepared the
only multimodal hate speech dataset for-a-kind of problem for Bengali, which we
use to train state-of-the-art neural architectures (e.g., Bi-LSTM/Conv-LSTM
with word embeddings, ConvNets + pre-trained language models, e.g., monolingual
Bangla BERT, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and XLM-RoBERTa) to jointly
analyze textual and visual information for hate speech detection. Conv-LSTM and
XLM-RoBERTa models performed best for texts, yielding F1 scores of 0.78 and
0.82, respectively. As of memes, ResNet-152 and DenseNet-161 models yield F1
scores of 0.78 and 0.79, respectively. As for multimodal fusion, XLM-RoBERTa +
DenseNet-161 performed the best, yielding an F1 score of 0.83. Our study
suggests that text modality is most useful for hate speech detection, while
memes are moderately useful.

we should resort to heuristics to find high-fidelity mappings. In this paper,
we focused on finding efficient heuristic techniques to incorporate real-time
error feedback and device connectivity information in order to achieve high

experimental study based on two baseline algorithms. We performed our

extremely difficult to obtain an optimal solution, especially since topology
planning in networks also often comes with management-specific constraints. As
a result, local optimization with hand-tuned heuristic methods from human
experts are often adopted in practice. Yet, heuristic methods cannot cover the

guarantee to find good solutions.

verifier to validate the correctness of a generated network topology, a graph

conduct a case study based on a real network scenario, and our experimental
