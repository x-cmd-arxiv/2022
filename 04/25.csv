are able to significantly improve system effectiveness over traditional sparse
models such as BM25. Though highly effective, these neural approaches are very
expensive to run, making them difficult to deploy under strict latency
constraints. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed new
families of learned sparse models that try to match the effectiveness of
learned dense models, while leveraging the traditional inverted index data
structure for efficiency. Current learned sparse models learn the weights of
terms in documents and, sometimes, queries; however, they exploit different
vocabulary structures, document expansion techniques, and query expansion
strategies, which can make them slower than traditional sparse models such as
BM25. In this work, we propose a novel indexing and query processing technique
that exploits a traditional sparse model's ""guidance"" to efficiently traverse
the index, allowing the more effective learned model to execute fewer scoring
operations. Our experiments show that our guided processing heuristic is able
to boost the efficiency of the underlying learned sparse model by a factor of
four without any measurable loss of effectiveness.

form of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), whose states
are given by the number of subjects in different health conditions. The model
also exposes the different parameters that have an impact on the spread of the
disease and the various decision variables that can be used to control it (e.g,
social distancing, number of tests administered to single out infected
subjects). The model describes the stochastic phenomena that underlie the
spread of the epidemic and captures, in the form of deterministic parameters,
some fundamental limitations in the availability of resources (hospital beds
and test swabs). The model lends itself to different uses. For a given control
policy, it is possible to verify if it satisfies an analytical property on the
stochastic evolution of the state (e.g., to compute probability that the
hospital beds will reach a fill level, or that a specified percentage of the
population will die). If the control policy is not given, it is possible to
apply POMDP techniques to identify an optimal control policy that fulfils some
specified probabilistic goals. Whilst the paper primarily aims at the model

statistical decision theory. I show that the answer is positive and simple when
the relevant parameter (true state of nature) is point identified. However, a
subtlety arises when the true state is partially identified, and a decision
must be made under ambiguity. Then the performance of some criteria,
particularly minimax regret, is enhanced by permitting randomized choice of an
action, which essentially requires availability of sample data. I show that an

decisions where there are no head-to-head trials between the treatments of
interest, there is a common comparator arm shared by the studies, and there are
patient-level data limitations. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) is
the most widely used covariate-adjusted indirect comparison method. MAIC has
poor precision and is inefficient when the effective sample size after
weighting is small. A modular extension to MAIC, termed two-stage
matching-adjusted indirect comparison (2SMAIC), is proposed. This uses two
parametric models. One estimates the treatment assignment mechanism in the
study with individual patient data (IPD), the other estimates the trial
assignment mechanism. The resulting weights seek to balance covariates between
treatment arms and across studies. A simulation study provides
proof-of-principle in an indirect comparison performed across two randomized
trials and explores the use of weight truncation in combination with MAIC for
the first time. Despite enforcing randomization and knowing the true treatment
assignment mechanism in the IPD trial, 2SMAIC yields improved precision and
efficiency with respect to MAIC in all scenarios, while maintaining similarly
low levels of bias. The two-stage approach is effective when sample sizes in
the IPD trial are low, as it controls for chance imbalances in prognostic
baseline covariates between study arms. It is not as effective when overlap
between the trials' target populations is poor and the extremity of the weights
is high. In these scenarios, truncation leads to substantial precision and
efficiency gains but induces considerable bias. The combination of a two-stage
approach with truncation produces the highest precision and efficiency
improvements.

extensively used to study the optimization process of these networks. Though,
it usually holds in a very small neighborhood of the minimum, it cannot explain
many phenomena observed during the optimization process. In this work, we study
the structure of neural network loss functions and its implication on
optimization in a region beyond the reach of a good quadratic approximation.
Numerically, we observe that neural network loss functions possesses a
multiscale structure, manifested in two ways: (1) in a neighborhood of minima,
the loss mixes a continuum of scales and grows subquadratically, and (2) in a
larger region, the loss shows several separate scales clearly. Using the
subquadratic growth, we are able to explain the Edge of Stability phenomenon
[5] observed for the gradient descent (GD) method. Using the separate scales,
we explain the working mechanism of learning rate decay by simple examples.
Finally, we study the origin of the multiscale structure and propose that the
non-convexity of the models and the non-uniformity of training data is one of
the causes. By constructing a two-layer neural network problem we show that
training data with different magnitudes give rise to different scales of the
loss function, producing subquadratic growth and multiple separate scales.

still image. The key of our system is a surface-based layered representation
deriving from video decomposition, where the scene is decoupled into a surface
fluid layer and an impervious background layer with corresponding
transparencies to characterize the composition of the two layers. The animated
video can be produced by warping only the surface fluid layer according to the
estimation of fluid motions and recombining it with the background. In
addition, we introduce surface-only fluid simulation, a $2.5D$ fluid
calculation version, as a replacement for motion estimation. Specifically, we
leverage the triangular mesh based on a monocular depth estimator to represent
the fluid surface layer and simulate the motion in the physics-based framework
with the inspiration of the classic theory of the hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian
method, along with a learnable network so as to adapt to complex real-world
image textures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system through
comparison with existing methods in both standard objective metrics and
subjective ranking scores. Extensive experiments not only indicate our method's
competitive performance for common fluid scenes but also better robustness and
reasonability under complex transparent fluid scenarios. Moreover, as the
proposed surface-based layer representation and surface-only fluid simulation
naturally disentangle the scene, interactive editing such as adding objects to
the river and texture replacing could be easily achieved with realistic
results.

also, more strikingly, Casimir self-entropies of bodies can be negative. Here,
we attempt to interpret the physical origin and meaning of these negative
self-entropies by investigating the Casimir self-entropy of a neutral spherical
nanoparticle. After extracting the polarizabilities of such a particle by
examining the asymptotic behavior of the scattering Green's function, we
compute the corresponding free energy and entropy. Two models for the
nanoparticle, namely a spherical plasma $\delta$-function shell and a
homogeneous dielectric/diamagnetic ball, are considered at low temperature,
because that is all that can be revealed from a nanoparticle perspective. The
second model includes a contribution to the entropy from the bulk free energy,
referring to the situation where the medium inside or outside the ball fills
all space, which must be subtracted on physical grounds in order to maintain
consistency with van der Waals interactions, corresponding to the self-entropy
of each bulk. (The van der Waals calculation is described in Appendix A.) The
entropies so calculated agree with known results in the low-temperature limit,
appropriate for a small particle, and are negative. But we suggest that the
negative self-entropy is simply an interaction entropy, the difference between
the total entropy and the blackbody entropy of the two bulks, outside or inside
of the nanosphere. The vacuum entropy is always positive and overwhelms the
interaction entropy. Thus the interaction entropy can be negative, without
contradicting the principles of statistical thermodynamics. Because the entropy
of blackbody radiation by itself plays an important role, it is also discussed,
including dispersive effects, in detail.

in recommender systems and collaborative filtering (CF), the mechanism of how
they, especially the core components (\textit{i.e.,} neighborhood aggregation)
contribute to recommendation has not been well studied. To unveil the
effectiveness of GCNs for recommendation, we first analyze them in a spectral
perspective and discover two important findings: (1) only a small portion of
spectral graph features that emphasize the neighborhood smoothness and
difference contribute to the recommendation accuracy, whereas most graph
information can be considered as noise that even reduces the performance, and
(2) repetition of the neighborhood aggregation emphasizes smoothed features and
filters out noise information in an ineffective way. Based on the two findings
above, we propose a new GCN learning scheme for recommendation by replacing
neihgborhood aggregation with a simple yet effective Graph Denoising Encoder
(GDE), which acts as a band pass filter to capture important graph features. We
show that our proposed method alleviates the over-smoothing and is comparable
to an indefinite-layer GCN that can take any-hop neighborhood into
consideration. Finally, we dynamically adjust the gradients over the negative
samples to expedite model training without introducing additional complexity.
Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed method
not only outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves 12x speedup over

Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is one of such external methods, which requires a

consists of instances randomly sampled from the training dataset. However, the
sampling size and its effect on SHAP remain to be unexplored. In our empirical

decreases with the increase of the background dataset size. Also, we notice an
U-shape in the stability assessment of SHAP variable rankings, demonstrating
that SHAP is more reliable in ranking the most and least important variables

bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. We show that every equivariant vector
bundle canonically descends to a locally analytic vector bundle. A comparison
with the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in the cyclotomic case then
recovers the Cherbonnier-Colmez decompletion theorem. Next, we focus on the
subcategory of de Rham locally analytic vector bundles. Using the p-adic
monodromy theorem, we show that each locally analytic vector bundle
$\mathcal{E}$ has a canonical differential equation for which the space of
solutions has full rank. As a consequence, $\mathcal{E}$ and its sheaf of
solutions $\mathrm{Sol}(\mathcal{E})$ are in a natural correspondence, which
gives a geometric interpretation of a result of Berger on
$(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules. In particular, if $V$ is a de Rham Galois
representation, its associated filtered $(\varphi,N,G_{K})$-module is realized
as the space of global solutions to the differential equation. A key to our
approach is a vanishing result for the higher locally analytic vectors of

with unique slopes and small scatters around the age-[X/Fe] relations. In this
study, we turn to simulations to explore the age-[X/Fe] relations for the
elements C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca that are traced in a FIRE-2 cosmological
zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, m12i, and understand what
physical conditions give rise to the observed age-[X/Fe] trends. We first
explore the distributions of mono-age populations in their birth and current
locations, [Fe/H], and [X/Fe], and find evidence for inside-out radial growth
for stars with ages < 7 Gyr. We then examine the age-[X/Fe] relations across
m12i's disk and find that the direction of the trends agree with observations,
apart from C, O, and Ca, with remarkably small intrinsic scatters,
$\sigma_{int}$ (0.01-0.04 dex). This $\sigma_{int}$ measured in the simulations
is also metallicity-dependent, with $\sigma_{int}$ $\approx$ 0.025 dex at
[Fe/H]=-0.25 dex versus $\sigma_{int}$ $\approx$ 0.015 dex at [Fe/H]=0 dex, and
a similar metallicity dependence is seen in the GALAH survey for the elements
in common. Additionally, we find that $\sigma_{int}$ is higher in the inner
galaxy, where stars are older and formed in less chemically-homogeneous
environments. The age-[X/Fe] relations and the small scatter around them
indicate that simulations capture similar chemical enrichment variance as
observed in the Milky Way, arising from stars sharing similar element
abundances at a given birth place and time.

  Keys","52 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Secure aggregation, which is a core component of federated learning,
aggregates locally trained models from distributed users at a central server.
The ``secure'' nature of such aggregation consists of the fact that no
information about the local users' data must be leaked to the server except the
aggregated local models. In order to guarantee security, some keys may be
shared among the users. After the key sharing phase, each user masks its
trained model which is then sent to the server. This paper follows the
information theoretic secure aggregation problem originally formulated by Zhao
and Sun, with the objective to characterize the minimum communication cost from
the K users in the model aggregation phase. Due to user dropouts, the server
may not receive all messages from the users. A secure aggregation scheme should
tolerate the dropouts of at most $K-U$ users. The optimal communication cost is
characterized by Zhao and Sun, but with the assumption that the keys stored by
the users could be any random variables with arbitrary dependency. On the
motivation that uncoded groupwise keys are more convenient to be shared and
could be used in large range of applications besides federated learning, in
this paper we assume the key variables are mutually independent and each key is
shared by a group of S users. To the best of our knowledge, all existing secure
aggregation schemes assign coded keys to the users. We show that if $S> K-U$, a
new secure aggregation scheme with uncoded groupwise keys can achieve the same
optimal communication cost as the best scheme with coded keys; if $S \leq K-U$,
uncoded groupwise key sharing is strictly sub-optimal. Finally, we also
implement our proposed secure aggregation scheme into Amazon EC2, which are
then compared with the existing secure aggregation schemes with offline key
sharing.

exposes all the hidden nodes to the output-layer nodes. HLConcFNNs have the
interesting property that, given a network architecture, when additional hidden
layers are appended to the network or when extra nodes are added to the
existing hidden layers the representation capacity of the HLConcFNN associated
with the new architecture is guaranteed to be not smaller than that of the
original network architecture. Here representation capacity refers to the set
of all functions that can be exactly represented by the neural network of a
given architecture. We present ample benchmark tests with linear/nonlinear PDEs
to demonstrate the computational accuracy and performance of the HLConcELM
method and the superiority of this method to the conventional ELM from previous
works.

short-term central anomaly with double-bump features that cannot be explained

interpreting the anomaly, we analyze the lensing light curve under various
sophisticated models. We find that the anomaly is explained by a model, in
which both the lens and source are binaries (2L2S model). For this
interpretation, the lens is a planetary system with a planet/host mass ratio of
$q\sim 1.5\times 10^{-3}$, and the source is a binary composed of a turn off or
a subgiant star and a mid K dwarf. The double-bump feature of the anomaly can
also be depicted by a triple-lens model (3L1S model), in which the lens is a
planetary system containing two planets. Among the two interpretations, the
2L2S model is favored over the 3L1S model not only because it yields a better
fit to the data, by $\Delta\chi^2=[14.3$--18.5], but also the Einstein radii
derived independently from the two stars of the binary source result in
consistent values. According to the 2L2S interpretation, KMT-2021-BLG-1898 is
the third planetary lensing event occurring on a binary stellar system,
following MOA-2010-BLG-117 and KMT-2018-BLG-1743. Under the 2L2S
interpretation, we identify two solutions resulting from the close-wide
degeneracy in determining the planet-host separation. From a Bayesian analysis,
we estimate that the planet has a mass of $\sim 0.7$--0.8~$M_{\rm J}$, and it
orbits an early M dwarf host with a mass of $\sim 0.5~M_\odot$. The projected
planet-host separation is $\sim 1.9$~AU and $\sim 3.0$~AU according to the
close and wide solutions, respectively.

short-lasting anomaly with complex features near the peak at the 0.1~mag level
from a single-lens single-source model. We conducted modeling of the lensing
light curve under various interpretations to reveal the nature of the anomaly.
It is found that the anomaly cannot be explained with the usual model based on
a binary-lens (2L1S) or a binary-source (1L2S) interpretation. However, a 2L1S
model with a planet companion can describe part of the anomaly, suggesting that
the anomaly may be deformed by a tertiary lens component or a close companion
to the source. From the additional modeling, we find that all the features of
the anomaly can be explained with either a triple-lens (3L1S) model or a
binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model obtained under the 3L1S interpretation.
However, it is difficult to validate the 2L2S model because the light curve
does not exhibit signatures induced by the source orbital motion and the
ellipsoidal variations expected by the close separation between the source
stars according to the model. We, therefore, conclude that the two
interpretations cannot be distinguished with the available data, and either can
be correct. According to the 3L1S solution, the lens is a planetary system with
two sub-Jovian-mass planets in which the planets have masses of
0.32--0.47~$M_{\rm J}$ and 0.44--0.93~$M_{\rm J}$, and they orbit an M dwarf
host. According to the 2L2S solution, on the other hand, the lens is a single
planet system with a mass of $\sim 0.21~M_{\rm J}$ orbiting a late K-dwarf
host, and the source is a binary composed of a primary of a subgiant or a
turnoff star and a secondary of a late G dwarf. The distance to the planetary
system varies depending on the solution: $\sim 7.0$~kpc according to the 3L1S
solution and $\sim 6.6$~kpc according to the 2L2S solution.

learn and generalize sufficiently to the given task; nonetheless, this often

models on vision tasks usually have heavy parameters and bear training
difficulty. However, many dense-prediction low-level computer vision tasks,

computing power and memory in practice. Hence, we introduce a recursive local
window-based self-attention structure with residual connections and propose
deraining a recursive transformer (DRT), which enjoys the superiority of the
transformer but requires a small amount of computing resources. In particular,
through recursive architecture, our proposed model uses only 1.3% of the number
of parameters of the current best performing model in deraining while exceeding
the state-of-the-art methods on the Rain100L benchmark by at least 0.33 dB.
Ablation studies also investigate the impact of recursions on derain outcomes.
Moreover, since the model contains no deliberate design for deraining, it can
also be applied to other image restoration tasks. Our experiment shows that it
can achieve competitive results on desnowing. The source code and pretrained

  in tailings","Numerical Methods in Geotechnical Engineering 2023",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deformation analyses of tailings dams under dynamic conditions require using
earthquake records as input loading. Moreover, these records must represent the
local seismicity, expressed by ground motion power indicators denominated
intensity measures (IM). The ability and accuracy to describe the
characteristics of a seismic record play a fundamental role in earthquake
engineering and damage assessment of geotechnical facilities. None of the
existing IMs represents a robust enough predictor of a given seismic demand
(e.g., residual displacements). Different signals may generate a wide spectrum
of results, with diverse effects that could produce insignificant damage to
global failure depending on the structure. Usual engineering procedures select
a huge number of records to overcome this limitation and develop a large set of
numerical simulations to bound the uncertainty of the results, which becomes a
time-consuming approach. This paper presents a new high-fidelity seismic IM to
perform more accurate ground motion {selection}, which captures the spectral
properties of the record for the frequency content that the dam does not
filter. This IM represents a way to estimate beforehand a seismic demand,
expressed, for instance, in terms of displacements. The proposed IM is applied
to a finite element model for an upstream tailings dam cross-section, using a
constitutive model capable of capturing dynamic liquefaction. The obtained
results show that our proposal gives highly reliable correlations with
different selected demands. Comparisons with classical IMs are also discussed,
showing that our proposal emerges as a practical solution to a large dated

advantages of increased inter-class separation and smaller intra-class

the discriminative embeddings, and cosine similarity scoring (Cos) achieves
better performance than PLDA in some situations. Motivated by this, in this

analyzing PLDA and the properties of DSEs extracted from models with different

Toward this, QEC experiments using the surface codes have recently been

performed a full simulation of QEC for the rotated surface codes with a code
distance 5, which employs 49 qubits and is within reach of the current
state-of-the-art quantum computers. In particular, we evaluate the logical
error probability in a realistic noise model that incorporates not only
stochastic Pauli errors but also coherent errors due to a systematic control
error or unintended interactions. While a straightforward simulation of 49
qubits is not tractable within a reasonable computational time, we reduced the
number of qubits required to 26 qubits by delaying the syndrome measurement in
simulation. This and a fast quantum computer simulator, Qulacs, implemented on
GPU allows us to simulate full QEC with an arbitrary local noise within
reasonable simulation time. Based on the numerical results, we also construct
and verify an effective model to incorporate the effect of the coherent error
into a stochastic noise model. This allows us to understand what the effect
coherent error has on the logical error probability on a large scale without
full simulation based on the detailed full simulation of a small scale. The
present simulation framework and effective model, which can handle arbitrary
local noise, will play a vital role in clarifying the physical parameters that

understand the traffic laws, thus rely on the programmers manually writing the
corresponding principles into the driving systems. It would be less efficient
and hard to adapt some temporary traffic laws, especially when the vehicles use
data-driven decision-making algorithms. Besides, current self-driving vehicle
systems rarely take traffic law modification into consideration. This work aims
to design a road traffic law adaptive decision-making method. The
decision-making algorithm is designed based on reinforcement learning, in which
the traffic rules are usually implicitly coded in deep neural networks. The
main idea is to supply the adaptability to traffic laws of self-driving

language-based traffic laws are first translated into a logical expression by
the Linear Temporal Logic method. Then, the system will try to monitor in

designing a long-term RL action space. Finally, a sample-based planning method
will re-plan the trajectory when the vehicle may break the traffic rules. The
method is validated in a Beijing Winter Olympic Lane scenario and an overtaking

the self-driving vehicles can comply with new issued or updated traffic laws

the redundant packets are sent at the first transmission, otherwise,
re-transmission will be used. We first derive a concise and tight lower bound
of the block error probability of SNC without re-transmission. Then, based on
the bound, the theoretical expressions of the proposed re-transmission schemes
are derived regarding the block error probability, the average code length, and
the average packet latency. Results show that the proposed SNC with
re-transmission improves block error probability and keeps the low latency.

492 GHz has a scattered relation with the 870 micron-traced molecular gas.
Finally, we performed LTE and non-LTE analyses of the [CI] 492 GHz and 809 GHz

  insights from the matching between electron and phonon bands","20 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that carrier mobility in layered semiconductors generally
increases from two-dimension (2D) to three-dimension due to suppressed
scattering channels resulting from decreased densities of electron and phonon
states. In this work, we find an abnormal decrease of electron mobility from
monolayer to bulk MoS2. By carefully analyzing the scattering mechanisms, we
can attribute such abnormality to the stronger intravalley scattering in the
monolayer but weaker intervalley scattering caused by less intervalley
scattering channels and weaker corresponding electron-phonon couplings compared
to the bulk case. We show that, it is the matching between electronic band
structure and phonon spectrum rather than their densities of electronic and
phonon states that determines scattering channels. We propose, for the first
time, the phonon-energy-resolved matching function to identify the intra- and
inter-valley scattering channels. Furthermore, we show that multiple valleys do
not necessarily lead to strong intervalley scattering if: (1) the scattering
channels, which can be explicitly captured by the distribution of the matching
function, are few due to the small matching between the corresponding electron
and phonon bands; and/or (2) the multiple valleys are far apart in the
reciprocal space and composed of out-of-plane orbitals so that the
corresponding electron-phonon coupling strengths are weak. Consequently, the
searching scope of high-mobility 2D materials can be reasonably enlarged using
the matching function as useful guidance with the help of band edge orbital
analysis.

$cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$ at room temperature. Despite being polar and the band edges
located at the K point with multiple valleys, these three systems unusually
have small carrier scattering rates. Detailed analysis shows that, both the
intravalley scattering and the intervalley scattering between two equivalent K
points are weak, which can be understood from the large mismatch between the
electron bands and phonon spectrum and suppressed electron-phonon coupling
strength. Furthermore, we reveal the general trend of mobility increase from BP

out-of-plane orbitals tend to result in small match between the electron and

Dynamically assessing the trustworthiness of each view for different samples

across images that capture object and view-invariance of a category without
external supervision. Grouping naturally has levels of granularity, creating
ambiguity in unsupervised segmentation. Existing methods avoid this ambiguity
and treat it as a factor outside modeling, whereas we embrace it and desire
hierarchical grouping consistency for unsupervised segmentation.
  We approach unsupervised segmentation as a pixel-wise feature learning
problem. Our idea is that a good representation shall reveal not just a
particular level of grouping, but any level of grouping in a consistent and
predictable manner. We enforce spatial consistency of grouping and bootstrap
feature learning with co-segmentation among multiple views of the same image,
and enforce semantic consistency across the grouping hierarchy with clustering
transformers between coarse- and fine-grained features.
  We deliver the first data-driven unsupervised hierarchical semantic
segmentation method called Hierarchical Segment Grouping (HSG). Capturing
visual similarity and statistical co-occurrences, HSG also outperforms existing
unsupervised segmentation methods by a large margin on five major object- and

detection from ultrasound (USG) images as no prior study is known. USG is the
most common diagnostic modality for GB diseases due to its low cost and
accessibility. However, USG images are challenging to analyze due to low image
quality, noise, and varying viewpoints due to the handheld nature of the
sensor. Our exhaustive study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification
techniques for the problem reveals that they often fail to learn the salient GB
region due to the presence of shadows in the USG images. SOTA object detection
techniques also achieve low accuracy because of spurious textures due to noise
or adjacent organs. We propose GBCNet to tackle the challenges in our problem.
GBCNet first extracts the regions of interest (ROIs) by detecting the GB (and
not the cancer), and then uses a new multi-scale, second-order pooling
architecture specializing in classifying GBC. To effectively handle spurious
textures, we propose a curriculum inspired by human visual acuity, which
reduces the texture biases in GBCNet. Experimental results demonstrate that
GBCNet significantly outperforms SOTA CNN models, as well as the expert
radiologists. Our technical innovations are generic to other USG image analysis

overcome this problem, we propose joint feature distribution alignment learning

we utilize droplet interface bilayers(DIBs), a bilayer formed artificially

sensitive to salt concentration, ion size and valency. Subsequently, we
measured DIB formation rates and show that the characteristic bilayer formation
velocity scales with the ratio of the interfacial tension to the interfacial

the QCD sum rule analysis determines certain combinations of changes for these

assessments of embrittlement for a very wide range of materials, with higher
accuracy than industrial correlations. The core of our model is a multiscale
modelling tool that predicts the kinetics of solute clustering, given the steel
chemical composition and its irradiation conditions. It is based on the
observation that the formation of solute clusters ensues from atomic transport
driven by radiation-induced mechanisms, differently from classical
nucleation-and-growth theories. We then show that the predicted information
about solute clustering can be translated into a reliable estimate for
radiation-induced embrittlement, via standard hardening laws based on the
dispersed barrier model. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by
applying it to hundreds of nuclear reactors vessels from all over the world.

find a considerable overlap in query entities, query intent, and relevance

resamples the training and test data based on query similarity and utilizes the

  Networks","30 pages, 17 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new model of parental decision making
concerning vaccines against a childhood disease spreading over a contact
network. We consider a bi-layer network that is comprised of two overlapping
networks which are either Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (random) networks or
Barab\'{a}si-Albert networks. The new model is using a Bayesian aggregation
rule for observational social learning, happening over a social network, of
which other decision models, like voting and DeGroot models, are special cases.
Using our new model, we show how some levels of social learning about
vaccination preferences can lead to convergence of opinions and affect levels
of vaccine uptake and so disease spread. Moreover, we study the effect of the
existence of two cultures of social learning on the establishment of social
norms of vaccination and levels of vaccine uptake. In all cases, the mutual
influence between the dynamics of observational social learning and disease
spread are dependent on the network's topology, and vaccine safety and
availability.

shown great success in translating natural language to code (Chen et al., 2021;
Austin et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022, inter alia). While these models do not
explicitly incorporate program semantics (i.e., execution results) during
training, they are able to generate correct solutions for many problems.
However, choosing a single correct program from a generated set for each
problem remains challenging. In this work, we introduce execution result--based
minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBR-EXEC) for program selection and show that it
improves the few-shot performance of pretrained code models on
natural-language-to-code tasks. We select output programs from a generated
candidate set by marginalizing over program implementations that share the same
semantics. Because exact equivalence is intractable, we execute each program on
a small number of test inputs to approximate semantic equivalence. Across
datasets, execution or simulated execution significantly outperforms the
methods that do not involve program semantics. We find that MBR-EXEC
consistently improves over all execution-unaware selection methods, suggesting
it as an effective approach for natural language to code translation. We

Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature for any clamped plates in 2

beyond 3. These results complement those from the flat (M. Ashbaugh & R.
Benguria, 1995, and N. Nadirashvili, 1995) and negatively curved (A.
Krist\'aly, 2020) cases that are valid only in 2 and 3 dimensions, and at the
same time also provide the first positive answer to Lord Rayleigh's conjecture
in higher dimensions. The proofs rely on an
Ashbaugh-Benguria-Nadirashvili-Talenti nodal-decomposition argument, on the
L\'evy-Gromov isoperimetric inequality, on fine properties of Gaussian
hypergeometric functions and on sharp spectral gap estimates of fundamental
tones for both small and large clamped spherical caps. Our results show that
positive curvature enhances genuine differences between low- and
high-dimensional settings, a tacitly accepted paradigm in the theory of
vibrating clamped plates. In the limit case - when the Ricci curvature is
non-negative - we establish a Lord Rayleigh-type isoperimetric inequality that
involves the asymptotic volume ratio of the non-compact complete Riemannian
manifold; moreover, the inequality is strongly rigid in 2 and 3 dimensions,
i.e., if equality holds for a given clamped plate then the manifold is
isometric to the Euclidean space.

These paradigms, however, are not without flaws, i.e., running the model on all

This paper proposes a new training and inference paradigm for re-ranking. We
propose to finetune a pretrained encoder-decoder model using in the form of
document to query generation. Subsequently, we show that this encoder-decoder
architecture can be decomposed into a decoder-only language model during
inference. This results in significant inference time speedups since the
decoder-only architecture only needs to learn to interpret static encoder

achieves results that are comparable to the more expensive cross-attention
ranking approaches while being up to 6.8X faster. We believe this work paves
the way for more efficient neural rankers that leverage large pretrained

that has benefited from the recent advancements in deep learning methods,
especially the advancements of convolutional neural networks (CNN). Although
state-of-the-art methods improve the performance of SISR on several datasets,
direct application of these networks for practical use is still an issue due to
heavy computational load. For this purpose, recently, researchers have focused
on more efficient and high-performing network structures. Information
multi-distilling network (IMDN) is one of the highly efficient SISR networks
with high performance and low computational load. IMDN achieves this efficiency
with various mechanisms such as Intermediate Information Collection (IIC),
working in a global setting, Progressive Refinement Module (PRM), and Contrast
Aware Channel Attention (CCA), employed in a local setting. These mechanisms,
however, do not equally contribute to the efficiency and performance of IMDN.
In this work, we propose the Global Progressive Refinement Module (GPRM) as a
less parameter-demanding alternative to the IIC module for feature aggregation.
To further decrease the number of parameters and floating point operations
persecond (FLOPS), we also propose Grouped Information Distilling Blocks
(GIDB). Using the proposed structures, we design an efficient SISR network
called IMDeception. Experiments reveal that the proposed network performs on
par with state-of-the-art models despite having a limited number of parameters

increases room for further optimization during deployment. To show its
potential, the proposed model was deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX and it
has been shown that it can run in real-time on this edge device

surprising, given its many potential benefits, such as higher sample efficiency

demonstrate, using an improved version of the recently introduced Local Change

that current deep model-based methods have serious limitations. We dive deeper
into the causes of this poor performance, by identifying elements that hurt
adaptive behavior and linking these to underlying techniques frequently used in
deep model-based RL. We empirically validate these insights in the case of
linear function approximation by demonstrating that a modified version of

high-accuracy crystal and electronic structure of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ by
employing a combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory
calculations, which correctly capture the Mott-insulating nature of the target

with an active $L_{\rm eff}=1$ orbital degree of freedom, in the absence of
spin-orbit coupling. The size of trigonal distortion within CoO$_6$ octahedra
is found to be not strong enough to completely quench the orbital degree of

quantum states within the larger set of (collections of) non-signalling joint
probability distributions over locally quantum observables. Here, we suggest a
natural generalisation of no-signalling in the form of no-disturbance to
dilated systems. We prove that non-signalling joint probability distributions
satisfying this extension correspond with bipartite quantum states up to a
choice of time orientation in subsystems.

some self-supervised frameworks have been proposed for training such denoising
networks directly on the noisy data without requiring ground truth. On
synthetic denoising problems supervised training outperforms self-supervised
approaches, however in recent years the gap has become narrower, especially for
video. In this paper, we propose a study aiming to determine which is the best
approach to train denoising networks for real raw videos: supervision on
synthetic realistic data or self-supervision on real data. A complete study
with quantitative results in case of natural videos with real motion is
impossible since no dataset with clean-noisy pairs exists. We address this
issue by considering three independent experiments in which we compare the two
frameworks. We found that self-supervision on the real data outperforms
supervision on synthetic data, and that in normal illumination conditions the
drop in performance is due to the synthetic ground truth generation, not the
noise model.

strong product of much simpler graphs. In particular, an elegant formulation
for the corresponding structural theorems involves the strong product of a path
and of a bounded treewidth graph, and allows to lift combinatorial results for
bounded treewidth graphs to graph classes for which the product structure
holds, such as to planar graphs [Dujmovi\'c et al., J. ACM, 67(4), 22:1-38,
2020].
  In this paper, we join the search for extensions of this powerful tool beyond
planarity by considering the h-framed graphs, a graph class that includes
1-planar, optimal 2-planar, and k-map graphs (for appropriate values of h). We
establish a graph product structure theorem for h-framed graphs stating that
the graphs in this class are subgraphs of the strong product of a path, of a
planar graph of treewidth at most 3, and of a clique of size $3\lfloor h/2
\rfloor +\lfloor h/3 \rfloor -1$. This allows us to improve over the previous
structural theorems for 1-planar and k-map graphs. Our results constitute
significant progress over the previous bounds on the queue number,
non-repetitive chromatic number, and p-centered chromatic number of these graph
classes, e.g., we lower the currently best upper bound on the queue number of
1-planar graphs and k-map graphs from 495 to 81 and from 32225k(k-3) to 61k,
respectively. We also employ the product structure machinery to improve the
current upper bounds of twin-width of planar and 1-planar graphs from 183 to
37, and from O(1) to 80, respectively. All our structural results are
constructive and yield efficient algorithms to obtain the corresponding
decompositions.

intellectual property. Traditional watermarking schemes often design in a
""wider"" rule, which applies one general embedding mechanism to all images. But
this will limit the scheme into a robustness-invisibility trade-off, where the
improvements of robustness can only be achieved by the increase of embedding
intensity thus causing the visual quality decay. However, a new scenario comes
out at this stage that many businesses wish to give high level protection to
specific valuable images, which requires high robustness and high visual
quality at the same time. Such scenario makes the watermarking schemes should
be designed in a ""deeper"" way which makes the embedding mechanism customized to
specific images. To achieve so, we break the robustness-invisibility trade-off
by introducing computation cost in, and propose a novel auto-decoder-like
image-specified watermarking framework (ISMark). Based on ISMark, the strong
robustness and high visual quality for specific images can be both achieved. In
detail, we apply an optimization procedure (OPT) to replace the traditional
embedding mechanism. Unlike existing schemes that embed watermarks using a
learned encoder, OPT regards the cover image as the optimizable parameters to
minimize the extraction error of the decoder, thus the features of each
specified image can be effectively exploited to achieve superior performance.

monopoles involved in QCD has been discussed so far in various ways. But still
there is an important problem unsolved. It is gauge invariance of the schemes

by means of the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Here it is shown that a random
Abelian method based on the violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity (VNABI)
could prove SU(3) invariance and explain why color-singlets alone can survive
in the confinement phase of QCD in the framework of the Abelian dual Meissner
effect due to Abelian monopole condensation. This is completely different from
the 't Hooft's Abelian projection scheme which introduces an additional partial
gauge-fixing or the idea of Bonati et al. which is based also on VNABI. Bonati
et al. say that VNABI is related to the 't Hooft tensor and the relation can
prove the gauge invariance of the 't Hooft's Abelian projection schemes. But
the last idea is found to be incorrect. Existence of the relation between VNABI

Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method. While this algorithm has been studied
in a number of previous works, most of them only show convergence from an
initialization close to the true solution and thus require a carefully designed
initialization scheme. However, random initialization has often been preferred
by practitioners as it is model-agnostic. In this paper, we show that ALS with
random initialization converges to the true solution with
$\varepsilon$-accuracy in $O(\log n + \log (1/\varepsilon)) $ iterations using
only a near-optimal amount of samples, where we assume the measurement matrices
to be i.i.d. Gaussian and where by $n$ we denote the ambient dimension. Key to
our proof is the observation that the trajectory of the ALS iterates only
depends very mildly on certain entries of the random measurement matrices.
Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions.

Assuming the availability of a control channel at sub-6 GHz frequencies, a
protocol is developed that permits estimating, for each UE, the strongest
propagation path from each of the surrounding APs, and to perform user-centric
association between the UEs and the APs. Estimation of the strongest paths from
nearby APs is realized at the UE in a one-phase procedure, during which all the
APs simultaneously transmit on pseudo-randomly selected channels with
pseudo-random transmit beamformers. An algorithm for orthogonal channels
assignment to the APs is also proposed, with the aim of minimizing the mutual
interference between APs that transmit on the same channels. The performance of
the proposed strategy is evaluated both in terms of probability of correct
detection of the directions of arrival and of departure associated to the
strongest beam from nearby APs, and in terms of downlink and uplink
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Numerical results show that the
proposed approach is effective and capable of efficiently realizing beam

by providing abundant teacher resources, but there lacks a developed mechanism
to utilize these teachers adequately. With a massive model repository composed
of teachers pre-trained on diverse tasks, we must surmount two obstacles when
using knowledge distillation to learn a new task. First, given a fixed
computing budget, it is not affordable to try each teacher and train the
student repeatedly, making it necessary to seek out the most contributive
teacher precisely and efficiently. Second, semantic gaps exist between the
teachers and the target student since they are trained on different tasks.
Thus, we need to extract knowledge from a general label space that may be
different from the student's. Faced with these two challenges, we study a new
setting named selective cross-task distillation that includes teacher
assessment and generalized knowledge reuse. We bridge the teacher's label space
and the student's label space through optimal transport. The transportation
cost from the teacher's prediction to the student's prediction measures the
relatedness between two tasks and acts as an objective for distillation. Our
method reuses cross-task knowledge from a distinct label space and efficiently
assesses teachers without enumerating the model repository. Experiments

context-aware approach by taking into consideration sparse keypoint annotations
by humans. We show that this approach allows for an automated derivation of
different object representations, such as binary maps or bounding boxes so that
detection models can be trained on different annotation variants and the
problem of providently detecting vehicles at night can be tackled from
different perspectives. With that, we provide further powerful tools and
methods to study the problem of detecting vehicles at night before they are

exploit the insensitive data on the server, in order to dynamically determine
the optimal steps of the server update for improving the convergence and

developed to perform unique pruning operations adapted to the different

geometry. Symplectic geometry is the natural framework to deal with autonomous
Hamiltonian mechanics. This admits several generalizations for nonautonomous
systems, both regular and singular. Some of these extensions are the subject of
this thesis.
  Recently there has been a growing interest in studying dissipative mechanical
systems from a geometric perspective using contact geometry. In this thesis we
review what has been done in this topic and go deeper, studying symmetries and
dissipated quantities of contact systems, and developing the Skinner-Rusk
formalism for these systems.
  With regard to classical field theory, we introduce the notion of
k-precosymplectic manifold and use it to give a geometric description of
singular nonautonomous field theories. We also devise a constraint algorithm
for these systems.
  Field theories with damping are described through a modification of the De
Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian field theory. This is achieved by combining contact
geometry and k-symplectic structures, resulting in the k-contact formalism. We
introduce two notions of dissipation laws, generalizing the concept of
dissipated quantity. These developments are also applied to Lagrangian field
theory. The Skinner-Rusk formulation for k-contact systems is described in
detail and we show how to recover the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms
from it.
  Throughout the thesis we present several examples in mechanics and field
theory. The most remarkable mechanical examples are the damped harmonic
oscillator, the motion in a gravitational field with friction, the parachute
equation and the damped simple pendulum. In field theory, we study the damped
vibrating string, the Burgers' equation, the Klein-Gordon equation and its
relation with the telegrapher's equation, and the Maxwell's equations with
dissipation.

reformulation technique to improve retrieval accuracy. It aims to alleviate the
mismatch of linguistic expressions between a query and its potential relevant
documents. Existing PRF methods independently treat revised queries originating
from the same query but using different numbers of feedback documents,
resulting in severe query drift. Without comparing the effects of two different
revisions from the same query, a PRF model may incorrectly focus on the
additional irrelevant information increased in the more feedback, and thus
reformulate a query that is less effective than the revision using the less
feedback. Ideally, if a PRF model can distinguish between irrelevant and
relevant information in the feedback, the more feedback documents there are,
the better the revised query will be. To bridge this gap, we propose the
Loss-over-Loss (LoL) framework to compare the reformulation losses between
different revisions of the same query during training. Concretely, we revise an
original query multiple times in parallel using different amounts of feedback
and compute their reformulation losses. Then, we introduce an additional
regularization loss on these reformulation losses to penalize revisions that
use more feedback but gain larger losses. With such comparative regularization,
the PRF model is expected to learn to suppress the extra increased irrelevant
information by comparing the effects of different revised queries. Further, we
present a differentiable query reformulation method to implement this
framework. This method revises queries in the vector space and directly
optimizes the retrieval performance of query vectors, applicable for both
sparse and dense retrieval models. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the
effectiveness and robustness of our method for two typical sparse and dense
retrieval models.

However, when the antenna spacing is made very small, the array gain of a
compact array can be proportional to the square of the number of antennas - a
value much larger than the traditional array. To achieve this so-called
""superdirectivity"" however, the calculation of the excitation coefficients

unilateral will of the exiting country. There are many examples of accession of

leaving is the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Motivated by the Brexit process, in this paper we propose an agent-based model
to study the determinant factors driving withdrawals from an economic union. We
show that both Union and local taxes promote the exits, whereas customs fees
out of the Union boost cohesion. Furthermore, heterogeneity in both business
conditions and wealth distribution promotes withdrawals, while countries' size
diversity does not have a significant effect on them. We also deep into the
individual causes that lead to dissatisfaction and, ultimately, to exits. We
found that, for low Union taxes, the wealth inequality within the country is
the leading cause of anti-Union opinion spreading. Conversely, for high Union
taxes, the country's performance turns out to be the main driving force,
resulting in a risk of wealthier countries leaving the Union. These findings
will be helpful for the design of economic policies and effective informative

disc's thermal structure. This thermal structure is predominantly set by dust
radiative transfer and viscous (accretional) heating and can be impacted by
gaps - regions of low dust and gas density that can occur when planets form.
The effect of variations in dust surface density on disc temperature has been
poorly understood until now. In this work, we use the radiative transfer code
MCMax to model the 2D dust thermal structure with individual gaps corresponding
to planets with masses of 0.1 M$_J$ - 5 M$_J$ and orbital radii of 3, 5, and 10
AU. Low dust opacity in the gap allows radiation to penetrate deeper into the
disc and warm the midplane by up to 16 K, but only for gaps located in the
region of the disc where stellar irradiation is the dominant source of heat
(here, a$\gtrsim$4 AU). In viscously-heated regions (a$\lesssim$4 AU), the
midplane of the gap is relatively cooler by up to 100 K. Outside of the gap,
broad radial oscillations in heating and cooling are present due to changes in
disc flaring. These thermal features affect local segregation of volatile
elements (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO2, CO) between the dust and gas. We find that
icelines experience dramatic shifts relative to gapless models: up to 6.5 AU
towards the star and 4.3 AU towards the midplane. While quantitative
predictions of iceline deviations will require more sophisticated models which
include transport and sublimation/condensation kinetics, our results provide
evidence that planet-induced iceline variations represent a potential feedback
from the planet onto the composition of material it is accreting.

in many applications, ranging from wavelength division multiplexing and
switching to channel routing. Bandwidth tunable filters are capable of meeting
the on-demand flexible operations in complex situations, due to their
advantages of scalability, multi-function, and energy-saving. It has been
investigated recently that parity-time (PT) symmetry coupled-resonant systems
can be applied to the bandwidth-tunable filters. However, due to the trade-off
between the bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio and insertion loss of system, the
bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio of this method is severely limited. Here, the
bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio is defined as the maximum bandwidth divided by
the minimum bandwidth. In this work, we show that high bandwidth-tunable
contrast ratio and low insertion loss of system can be achieved simultaneously
by increasing the coupling strength between the input port and the resonant.
System characterizations under different coupling states reveal that the low
insertion loss can be obtained when the system initially operates at the
over-coupling condition. A high bandwidth-tunable contrast ratio PT-symmetry
band-pass filter with moderate insertion loss is shown on the Silicon platform.
Our scheme provides an effective method to reduce the insertion loss of on-chip
tunable filters, which is also applicable to the high-order cascaded microring
systems.

how temperature affects these species is crucial to anticipate the implications
of global warming. In this work, we use an empirically-based numerical model to
study the combined dynamics of {\it Posidonia oceanica} and {\it Cymodocea

seagrass growth rates measured at the Western Mediterranean Sea. Under
favorable growth conditions, our simulations predict the emergence of a
coexistence region at the front between mono-specific meadows. This region can
be characterised by its width and local shoot densities, which are found to
depend on the coupling parameter between {\it Posidonia oceanica} and {\it
Cymodocea nodosa} species. Such regions have been empirically observed in Ses
Olles de Son Saura (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean Sea). A comparison
between the field measurements at the study site with the model predictions has
been used to fit the value of the coupling parameter. Field data also relates
the width of the coexistence region to the average length of {\it Posidonia
oceanica} leaves at the front. Remarkably, a linear relationship is found
between the coupling parameter and the leaf length. In the presence of sea
warming, the model predicts an exponential decay in the population of {\it
Posidonia oceanica}, which is highly sensitive to temperature. This behaviour
is a direct consequence of the clonal nature of the plant and can be
characterised by the model parameters. Considering a scenario of high
greenhouse emissions, our model forecasts that {\it Posidonia oceanica} meadows
will lose 70$\%$ of their population by the year $2050$. {\it Cymodocea
nodosa}, with higher thermal resilience, acts as an opportunistic species
conquering the space left by the degraded {\it Posidonia oceanica}.

the test time. Some kind of one-shot devices do not get destroyed when tested,
and so can continue within the experiment, providing extra information for
inference, if they did not fail before an inspection time. In addition, their
reliability can be rapidly estimated via accelerated life tests (ALTs) by
running the tests at varying and higher stress levels than working conditions.
In particular, step-stress tests allow the experimenter to increase the stress
levels at pre-fixed times gradually during the life-testing experiment. The
cumulative exposure model is commonly assumed for step-stress models, relating
the lifetime distribution of units at one stress level to the lifetime
distributions at preceding stress levels. In this paper,vwe develop robust

real-world application scenarios, where the goal is to predict the next
action(s) of the user based on his/her previous sequence of actions. In the
training process of recommender systems, the loss function plays an essential
role in guiding the optimization of recommendation models to generate accurate
suggestions for users. However, most existing sequential recommendation
techniques focus on designing algorithms or neural network architectures, and
few efforts have been made to tailor loss functions that fit naturally into the
practical application scenario of sequential recommender systems.
  Ranking-based losses, such as cross-entropy and Bayesian Personalized Ranking
(BPR) are widely used in the sequential recommendation area. We argue that such
objective functions suffer from two inherent drawbacks: i) the dependencies
among elements of a sequence are overlooked in these loss formulations; ii)
instead of balancing accuracy (quality) and diversity, only generating accurate
results has been over emphasized. We therefore propose two new loss functions
based on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) likelihood, that can be
adaptively applied to estimate the subsequent item or items. The
DPP-distributed item set captures natural dependencies among temporal actions,
and a quality vs. diversity decomposition of the DPP kernel pushes us to go
beyond accuracy-oriented loss functions. Experimental results using the
proposed loss functions on three real-world datasets show marked improvements
over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods in both quality and

decarbonisation agenda. With such a large expected load on the power system
from electric vehicles (EVs), it is important to coordinate charging in order
to balance the supply and demand for electricity. Bidirectional charging,
enabled through Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, will unlock significant
storage capacity from stationary EVs that are plugged in. To take this concept
a step further, this paper quantifies the potential revenues to be gained by a
commercial EV fleet operator from simultaneously scheduling its trips on a
day-ahead basis, as well as its charging. This allows the fleet to complete its
trips (with user defined trip length and distance), while taking advantage of
fluctuating energy and ancillary services prices. A mathematical framework for
optimal trip scheduling is proposed, formulated as a mixed-integer linear
program, and is applied to several relevant scenarios of the present and future
British electricity system. It is demonstrated that an optimal journey start
time can increase the revenue of commercial fleets by up to 38% in summer and
12% in winter. This means a single EV from the maintenance fleet can make
additional annual revenue of up to {\pounds}729. Flexible trip schedules are
more valuable in the summer because keeping EVs plugged in during peak solar
output will benefit the grid and the fleet operators the most. It was also
found that a fleet of 5,000 EVs would result in the equivalent $\textrm{CO}_2$
of removing one Combined Cycle Gas Turbine from the system. This significant
increase in revenue and carbon savings show this approach is worth

multiple-output (mMIMO), it is critical for the transmitter to accurately
acquire the channel state information (CSI). Deep learning (DL)-based methods
have been proposed for CSI compression and feedback to the transmitter.
Although most existing DL-based methods consider the CSI matrix as an image,
structural features of the CSI image are rarely exploited in neural network
design. As such, we propose a model of self-information that dynamically
measures the amount of information contained in each patch of a CSI image from
the perspective of structural features. Then, by applying the self-information
model, we propose a model-and-data-driven network for CSI compression and
feedback, namely IdasNet. The IdasNet includes the design of a module of
self-information deletion and selection (IDAS), an encoder of informative
feature compression (IFC), and a decoder of informative feature recovery (IFR).
In particular, the model-driven module of IDAS pre-compresses the CSI image by
removing informative redundancy in terms of the self-information. The encoder
of IFC then conducts feature compression to the pre-compressed CSI image and
generates a feature codeword which contains two components, i.e., codeword
values and position indices of the codeword values. Subsequently, the IFR
decoder decouples the codeword values as well as position indices to recover
the CSI image. Experimental results verify that the proposed IdasNet noticeably
outperforms existing DL-based networks under various compression ratios while
it has the number of network parameters reduced by orders-of-magnitude compared
with various existing methods.

increase the momenta of upstream electrons parallel to the magnetic field. In
$\lesssim 1\%$ of cases, upstream electrons are prematurely turned away from
the shock and never injected downstream. In contrast, a similar fraction are
re-scattered back towards the shock after reflection, re-interact with the

both intrinsic torques inducing self-rotation, as well as interparticle torques
leading to, for instance, the local alignment of particles' orientations.
Within this approach, although the functional form of the pairwise interactions
does not need to be specified, one can directly map the parameters of the field
theory onto the parameters of particle-based models. We perform a linear
stability analysis of the homogeneous solution of the field equations and find
both long-wavelength and short-wavelength instabilities. The former signals the
emergence of a macroscopic structure, which we associate with motility-induced
phase separation, while the second one signals the growth of a finite structure
with a characteristic size. Intrinsic torques hinder phase separation, pushing
the onset of the long-wavelength instability to higher activities. Further,
they generate finite-sized structures with a characteristic size proportional
to both the self-propulsion velocity and the inverse of the self-rotation
frequency. Our results show that a general mechanism might explain why
chirality tends to suppress motility-induced phase separation but instead

indicating the video events are provided for training. However, an event might
be labeled but not appear in one of the modalities, which results in a
modality-specific noisy label problem. In this work, we propose a training
strategy to identify and remove modality-specific noisy labels dynamically. It
is motivated by two key observations: 1) networks tend to learn clean samples
first; and 2) a labeled event would appear in at least one modality.
Specifically, we sort the losses of all instances within a mini-batch
individually in each modality, and then select noisy samples according to the
relationships between intra-modal and inter-modal losses. Besides, we also
propose a simple but valid noise ratio estimation method by calculating the
proportion of instances whose confidence is below a preset threshold. Our
method makes large improvements over the previous state of the arts (e.g. from
60.0\% to 63.8\% in segment-level visual metric), which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach. Code and trained models are publicly available

and hosts two fractional quasiparticles, itinerant Majorana fermion and
localized flux excitation. The former can carry heat and spin modulations in
the quantum spin liquid, but the role of the latter remains unknown for the
transport phenomena. Here, we focus on spin transport in the presence of
excited fluxes and report that they yield strong interference in the
propagation of the Majorana fermions, which feel gauge-like potential emergent
around the fluxes. We examine the transient spin dynamics triggered by a pulsed
magnetic field at an edge. In the absence of excited fluxes, the magnetic-field
pulse creates the plane wave of the Majorana fermions, which flows in the
quantum spin liquid. Although this wave does not accompany the change of local
spin moments in bulk, it induces local moments at the side opposite to the edge
under the magnetic-field pulse. We observe the spatial modulation of induced
spin moments when fluxes are excited in the bulk region. This behavior is more
striking than the case of lattice defects. Moreover, we find that, although the
amplitude of the spatial change is almost independent of the distance between
lattice defects, it is strongly enhanced by increasing the distance for the
case of excited fluxes. The difference is understood from the influence on the
itinerant Majorana fermions; the lattice defects change the system locally, but
flux excitations alter all the transfer integrals on the string connecting
them. The present results will provide another route to observing intrinsic
flux excitations distinguished from extrinsic effects such as lattice defects.

being red and dead is a crucial step in galaxy evolution, yet not fully
understood. In this work, we use the NIHAO suite of galaxy simulations to
investigate the relation between the transition time through the green valley
and other galaxy properties. The typical green valley crossing time of our
galaxies is approximately 400 Myr, somewhat shorter than observational
estimates. The crossing of the green valley is triggered by the onset of AGN
feedback and the subsequent shut down of star formation. Interestingly the time
spent in the green valley is not related to any other galaxy properties, such
as stellar age or metallicity, or the time at which the star formation
quenching takes place. The crossing time is set by two main contributions: the
ageing of the current stellar population and the residual star formation in the
green valley. These effects are of comparable magnitude, while major and minor
mergers have a negligible contribution. Most interestingly, we find the time
that a galaxy spends to travel through the green valley is twice the
$e$-folding time of the star formation quenching. This result is stable against
galaxy properties and the exact numerical implementation of AGN feedback in the
simulation. Assuming a typical crossing time of about one Gyr inferred from
observations, our results imply that any mechanism or process aiming to quench
star formation, must do it on a typical timescale of 500 Myr.

  Detection","Accepted to ACM MM 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  3D object detection from multiple image views is a fundamental and
challenging task for visual scene understanding. Due to its low cost and high
efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising
application prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through
perspective views in the 3D space is extremely difficult due to the lack of
depth information. Recently, DETR3D introduces a novel 3D-2D query paradigm in
aggregating multi-view images for 3D object detection and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, with intensive pilot experiments,
we quantify the objects located at different regions and find that the
""truncated instances"" (i.e., at the border regions of each image) are the main
bottleneck hindering the performance of DETR3D. Although it merges multiple
features from two adjacent views in the overlapping regions, DETR3D still
suffers from insufficient feature aggregation, thus missing the chance to fully
boost the detection performance. In an effort to tackle the problem, we propose
Graph-DETR3D to automatically aggregate multi-view imagery information through
graph structure learning (GSL). It constructs a dynamic 3D graph between each
object query and 2D feature maps to enhance the object representations,
especially at the border regions. Besides, Graph-DETR3D benefits from a novel
depth-invariant multi-scale training strategy, which maintains the visual depth
consistency by simultaneously scaling the image size and the object depth.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our Graph-DETR3D. Notably, our best model achieves 49.5 NDS on
the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art in comparison
with various published image-view 3D object detectors.

demand for computational power and memory ushers in the exascale era, in which
supercomputers are designed to provide enormous computing power to meet these
needs. These complex supercomputers consist of numerous compute nodes and are
consequently expected to experience frequent faults and crashes.
  Mathematical solvers, in particular, iterative linear solvers are key
building block in numerous large-scale scientific applications. Consequently,
supporting the recovery of distributed solvers is necessary for scaling
scientific applications to exascale platforms. Previous recovery methods for
iterative solvers are based on Checkpoint-Restart (CR), which incurs high fault
tolerance overhead, or intrinsic fault tolerance, which require extra
computation time to converge after failures.
  Exact state reconstruction (ESR) was proposed as an alternative mechanism to
alleviate the impact of frequent failures on long-term computations. ESR has
been shown to provide exact reconstruction of the computation state while
avoiding the need for costly checkpointing. However, ESR currently relies on
volatile memory for fault tolerance, and must therefore maintain redundancies
in the RAM of multiple nodes, incurring high memory and network overheads.
  Recent supercomputer designs feature emerging non-volatile RAM (NVRAM)
technology. This paper investigates how NVRAM can be utilized to devise an
enhanced ESR-based recovery mechanism that is more efficient and provides full
resilience. Our mechanism, called in-NVRAM ESR, is based on a novel MPI
One-Sided Communication (OSC) over RDMA implementation, and provides full
resiliency while significantly reducing both the memory footprint and the time
overhead in comparison with the original ESR design (in-RAM ESR).

the input of wind speed and wave age. Their quantification of the surface
roughness, on the other hand, varies considerably. The ocean surface roughness
is generally represented by the mean square slope, its direct measurement in
open ocean remains a challenging task. Microwave ocean remote sensing from
space delivers ocean surface roughness information. Satellite platforms offer
global coverage in a broad range of environmental conditions. This paper
presents lowpass mean square slope (LPMSS) data obtained by spaceborne
microwave altimeters and reflectometers operating at L, Ku, and Ka bands (about
1.6, 14, and 36 GHz). The LPMSS data represent the spectrally integrated ocean
surface roughness with 11, 95, and 250 rad/m upper cutoff wave numbers, the
maximum wind speeds are 80, 29, and 25 m/s, respectively. A better
understanding of the ocean surface roughness is important to the goal of
improving wind wave spectrum modeling. The analysis presented in this paper
shows that over two orders of magnitude of the wave number range (0.3 to 30
rad/m), the spectral components follow a power function relating the
dimensionless spectrum and the ratio between wind friction velocity and wave
phase speed. The power function exponent is 0.38, which is considerable smaller
than unity as expected from the classical equilibrium spectrum function. It may
suggest that wave breaking is not only an energy sink but also a source of
roughness generation covering a wideband of wavelengths about 20 m and shorter.

us an opportunity to further test perturbative QCD in an unexplored kinematical

energy $\sqrt{s}$, the BFKL resummation of energy logarithms comes into play,
since large energy logarithms compensate the smallness of QCD coupling
$\alpha_s$ and must therefore be accounted for to all perturbative orders.
Tracing the path toward performing precision calculations via BFKL resummation
of high-energy logarithms, in this thesis we present phenomenological analyses
for distinct inclusive processes, highlighting the recognized problem of
instabilities under higher-order corrections and energy-scales variations, that
would abort any possibility to investigate semi-hard reactions with
high-precision at natural energy-scales. At the same time, we present new
reactions that seem to act as fair stabilizers of the high-energy series.
First, the inclusive production at the LHC of a charged light hadron and of a
jet, featuring a wide separation in rapidity, is presented making use of
optimization methods to fix energy-scale. We report some predictions, tailored
on the CMS and CASTOR acceptances. Then, we propose as a novel probe channel
for the manifestation of the BFKL dynamics, the inclusive hadroproduction of a
Higgs boson and of a jet, featuring large transverse momenta and well separated
in rapidity. Finlay, we propose the inclusive semi-hard production of two
bottom-flavored hadrons, as well as of a single bottom-flavored hadron
accompanied by a light jet, as novel channels for targeting stabilization
effects of the high-energy resummation under higher-order corrections.

the equations of celestial mechanics. This paper focuses on the Liouville
system of differential equations. In a ""modern"" presentation of the equations,
variations in polar motion (PM) and variations in length of day (lod) are
decoupled. Their source terms result from redistribution of masses and torques.
Elasticity of the Earth, large earthquakes, or external forcing by the fluid
envelopes have been successively invoked in the ""modern"" approach. In the
""classical"" presentation, PM is governed by the inclination of Earth's rotation
pole and the derivative of its declination (close to the derivative of lod).
These are coupled by the Liouville system and all ""source"" terms are
astronomical. The ""classical"" approach also implies that there should be a link
between the rotations and the torques exerted by the planets of the solar
system. A sufficiently strong source of energy can be found. There is
remarkable agreement between the sum of forces exerted by the four Jovian
planets and components of Earth's polar motion. Since 1970, lod tends to
decrease, but a recent acceleration of rotation velocity, that contradicts
previous models, finds a simple explanation with the ""classical"" formalism.
Analysis of lod finds nine components, all with physical sense: first comes a
""trend"", then pseudo-oscillations with periods 80 yr , 18.6 yr, 11 yr , 1 year
and 0.5 yr, 27.54 days, 13.66 days, 13.63 days and 9.13 days. The longer
periods, 1 yr, 11 yr, 18.6 yr and 80 yr are common to lod and PM. The Liouville
system of equations in the ""classical"" analysis implies a strong link between
the two: the straightening of the inclination of the axis of rotation should
accompany a decrease in lod.Also, if this link is valid, all the components
with extraterrestrial periods should be present in the series of sunspots and
indeed they are.

achieve accurate and stable multi-object tracking between frames. In the

A novel atomic norm-based method is proposed to remove the interference signals

influence on the performance of the final device but unfortunately the
process-structure relationship is often poorly and only qualitatively
understood. This is because many different physical mechanisms (miscibility,
evaporation, crystallization, diffusion, advection) are active at potentially
different time scales, and because the kinetics plays a crucial role: the
morphology develops until it is kinetically quenched far from equilibrium. In
order to unravel the various possible structure formation pathways, we propose
a unified theoretical framework that takes into account all these physical

equations for diffusion and the Allen-Cahn equation for crystallization and
evaporation, which are coupled to the equations for the dynamics of the fluid.
We discuss and verify the behavior of the coupled model based on simple test

performance of various unitary topologies and the trainability of different
optimizers for getting high efficiency. In practice, we address different

graph-based ansatzes for preparing different entanglement target states such as
representative GHZ and W states. We also discuss the effect of the circuit
depth, barren plateau, readout noise in the model, and the error mitigation
solution. We next evaluate the reconstructing efficiency in quantum state
tomography via various popular circuit ansatzes and reveal the crucial role of
the circuit depth in the robust fidelity. The results are comparable with the
shadow tomography method, a similar fashion in the field. Our work expresses
the adequate capacity of the universal compilation-based variational algorithm

and constant jet power, which leads to the Bernoulli equation. For assumed
profiles of the bulk Lorentz factor and the radius, this gives us the profile
of the toroidal magnetic field component along the jet. We then consider the
case where the poloidal field component is connected to a rotating black hole
surrounded by an accretion disc. Our formalism then recovers the standard
formula for the power extracted from a rotating black hole. We find that the
poloidal field strength dominates over the toroidal one in the comoving frame
up to large distances, which means that jets should be more stable to
current-driven kink modes. The resulting magnetic field profiles can then be
used to calculate the jet synchrotron emission.

paper, we propose hybrid ISTA to unfold ISTA with both pre-computed and learned

We first develop HCISTA to improve the efficiency and flexibility of classical

in theory. Furthermore, the DNN-based hybrid algorithm is generalized to
popular variants of learned ISTA, dubbed HLISTA, to enable a free architecture
of learned parameters with a guarantee of linear convergence. To our best
knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a convergence-provable framework
that enables free-form DNNs in ISTA-based unfolded algorithms. This framework
is general to endow arbitrary DNNs for solving linear inverse problems with

reduce the reconstruction error with an improved convergence rate in the tasks

authentication techniques based on the delayed key disclosure to validate the
integrity of navigation messages. These authentication mechanisms have proven

guarantees of cryptographically protected GNSS signals and shows the
possibility of spoofing a receiver to an arbitrary location without breaking

ability of an attacker to receive signals close to the victim receiver and
generate spoofing signals for a different target location without modifying the

GNSS signal generators, and software-defined radio hardware platforms. Our
results show that it is possible to spoof a victim receiver to locations around

further highlight the fundamental limitations in securing a broadcast

range of applications, calling the needs of adaptive learning algorithms. We
thus study the problem of supervised gradual domain adaptation, where labeled

trajectory, and we aim to learn a classifier on a target data distribution of
interest. Under this setting, we provide the first generalization upper bound
on the learning error under mild assumptions. Our results are algorithm
agnostic, general for a range of loss functions, and only depend linearly on
the averaged learning error across the trajectory. This shows significant
improvement compared to the previous upper bound for unsupervised gradual
domain adaptation, where the learning error on the target domain depends
exponentially on the initial error on the source domain. Compared with the
offline setting of learning from multiple domains, our results also suggest the
potential benefits of the temporal structure among different domains in
adapting to the target one. Empirically, our theoretical results imply that
learning proper representations across the domains will effectively mitigate
the learning errors. Motivated by these theoretical insights, we propose a
min-max learning objective to learn the representation and classifier
simultaneously. Experimental results on both semi-synthetic and large-scale

in the airborne fraction (AF), defined as the fraction of CO2 emissions
remaining in the atmosphere. Testing the hypothesis of a trend in the AF has
attracted much attention, with the overall consensus that no statistical
evidence is found for a trend in the data (Knorr, 2009; Gloor et al., 2010;
Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). In their paper, van Marle et al.
analyze the AF as implied by three different LULCC emissions time series (GCP,

uninterrupted (positive or negative) trend in the airborne fraction remains
mixed at best. When allowing for a break in the trend, there is some evidence

introduced by Maurer in 2011 so as to handle interactive protocols.
  We design and construct a so-called {\em Interactive Server Memory Resource}
(ISMR), that is an augmented version of the basic instantiation of a
client-server protocol in CC, namely the Server Memory Resource. We then apply
our ISMR construction to two types of interactive cryptographic protocols for
remote storage : Updatable Encryption (UE) and Private Information Retrieval
(PIR).
  Concerning UE, our results are a composable version of those protocols,
clarifying the security guarantees achieved by {\em any} UE scheme. Namely, we
give the relevant security notion to consider according to a given leakage
context. Letting USMR denote our ISMR adapted to the UE application, we prove
that $\mathsf{IND}\text{-}\mathsf{UE}\text{-}\mathsf{CPA}$ security is
sufficient for a secure construction of a confidential USMR that hides the age
of ciphertexts; and
$\mathsf{IND}\text{-}(\mathsf{ENC}+\mathsf{UPD})\text{-}\mathsf{CPA}$ security
is sufficient for a secure construction of a confidential USMR in case of
unrestricted leakage. As a consequence, contrary to what was claimed before,
the $\mathsf{IND}\text{-}\mathsf{UE}$ security notion is not always stronger
than the $\mathsf{IND}\text{-}(\mathsf{ENC+UPD})$ one.
  Concerning PIR, we also give a composable version of PIR protocols, yielding
a unique model that unifies different notions of PIR : IT-PIR, C-PIR, one- or
multi- server PIR. Using the flexibility of CC, we are also able to model PIR
variants, such as SPIR.

  Networks",,"IEEE Wireless Communications 2022",,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the multi-dimensional exploration towards oceans, enormous sensing data
has been generated with significant volume, velocity, variety and
heterogeneity. The resulted Big Marine Data (BMD) thus issue unprecedented
architectural challenges on existing marine communication systems. Current
dominant marine communication technologies, e.g., shore-based cellular
stations, high frequency radio, and expensive satellites, extremely suffer from
short coverage, low bandwidth, insecurity, and unavailable cross-domain
transmission. In this paper, Resilient Vessel Network (RVN) is proposed to
fundamentally enhance BMD transmission. RVNs with widespread self-organized
vessels and opportunistic connections reveal advantages of ubiquity,
resilience, low cost and cross-domain transmission. To efficiently manage
opportunistic vessel-to-vessel (V2V) connections for optimal routing, Social
Network Analysis (SNA) on historical vessel interactions is applied for vessel
familiarity measurement and community detection. The performance of the
proposed community-based routing (CBR) is comprehensively evaluated with real
datasets of fishing vessel trajectories. It is demonstrated that CBR achieves
much lower transmission cost with comparable delivery ratio compared to typical
routing algorithms.

introduces a spontaneous collapse of state superposition: $\frac{d}{dt}
\rho_{ij} =-\frac{i}{\hbar}[H,\rho]_{ij}-\rho_{ij}/\tau_{ij}$. Different from
other collapse models, the collapsing scale $\tau_{ij}$ here does not contain a
universal parameter, but is specified by the two states $| i\rangle $ and $ |
j\rangle$: If each state is {\em in principle} repeatedly readable (typically
by a QND measurement), then $\tau_{ij}$ is the {\em potentially} needed
measuring time to discriminate the two states, and the collapse occurs
spontaneously {\em without} any actual monitoring. Otherwise,
$\tau_{ij}=\infty$, which means no collapse and everlasting superposition. This
happens if one state is not repeatedly readable, or if the two states cannot
possibly be discriminated in a particular circumstance (for example in the Rabi
oscillation). Detailed analysis shows that for a ""trapped Schr{\""o}dinger's
cat"", the superposition of $|{\rm here} \rangle$ and $| {\rm there} \rangle $
is forbidden if $E D \gg 4\pi \hbar c$, and allowed if $E D \le 4\pi \hbar c$,
where $D$ is the trap separation and $ E$ is the energy gap, which can be
estimated with $ M v^2$. The model also constrains a ""free Schr{\""o}dinger's
cat"" to display double-slit interference if $p\theta D\ge 8\hbar$, where $p=
Mv$, $\theta $ is the angle spanned by the two trajectories, and $D$ is the
slit separation. In contrast, this model sets no limit on the coherent length
of massless photon, thus the arm of a Michelson interferometer can be
arbitrarily long. The spontaneous collapse which we propose can occur for an
isolated system, and parallels the decoherence induced by interaction with

transverse rapidity coordinates ($y_{T1},y_{T2}$), allow access to dynamical
properties of the QCD medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions that
angular correlation measurements are not sensitive to. We report non-identified
charged-particle correlations for Au + Au minimum-bias collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV taken by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). Correlations are presented as 2D functions of
transverse rapidity for like-sign, unlike-sign and all charged-particle pairs,
as well as for particle pairs whose relative azimuthal angles lie on the
near-side, the away-side, or at all relative azimuth. The correlations are
constructed using charged particles with transverse momentum $p_T \geq 0.15$
GeV/$c$, pseudorapidity from $-$1 to 1, and azimuthal angles from $-\pi$ to
$\pi$. The significant correlation structures that are observed evolve smoothly
with collision centrality. The major correlation features include a saddle
shape plus a broad peak with maximum near $y_T \approx 3$, corresponding to
$p_T \approx$ 1.5 GeV/$c$. The broad peak is observed in both like- and
unlike-sign charge combinations and in near- and away-side relative azimuthal
angles. The all-charge, all-azimuth correlation measurements are compared with
the theoretical predictions of {\sc hijing} and {\sc epos}. The results
indicate that the correlations for peripheral to mid-central collisions can be
approximately described as a superposition of nucleon + nucleon collisions with
minimal effects from the QCD medium. Strong medium effects are indicated in
mid- to most-central collisions.

2021) suggest the emission is driven by an ultra - relativistic ($\gamma \sim
10^4$), cold plasma flow. A relativistically expanding plasma shell can
compress the ambient magnetic field, like a moving mirror, and thus produce
coherent radiation whose wavelength is shorter than that of the ambient medium
by $\gamma^2$. This mechanism has been studied in the past by Colgate and
Noerdelinger (1971), in the context of radio loud supernova explosions. In this
work we propose that a similar mechanism drives the coherent emission in fast
radio bursts. The high Lorenz factors dramatically lower the implied energy and
magnetic field requirements, allowing the spin down energy of regular (or even
recycled), fast spinning pulsars, rather than slow spinning magnetars, to
explain FRBs. We show that this model can explain the frequency and the time
evolution of observed FRBs, as well as their duration, energetics and absence
of panchromatic counterparts. We also predict that the peak frequency of sub
pulses decline with observation time as $\omega_{\rm obs} \propto t_{\rm
obs}^{-1/2}$. Unfortunately, with current capabilities it is not possible to
constrain the shape of the curve $\omega_{\rm obs} \left(t_{\rm obs} \right)$.
Finally, we find that a variation of this model can explain weaker radio
transients, such as the one observed from a galactic magnetar. In this variant,
the shock wave produces low frequency photons which are then Compton scattered
to the GHz range.

heterostructures. While this is achieved with independent top and bottom
metallic gate electrodes in transport experiments, it remains a challenge for
near-field optical studies as the top electrode interferes with the optical
path. Here, we systematically characterize the requirements for a material to
be used as top-gate electrode, and demonstrate experimentally that few-layer
WSe_2 can be used as a transparent, ambipolar top gate electrode in infrared
near-field microscopy. We perform nano-imaging of plasmons in a bilayer
graphene heterostructure and tune the plasmon wavelength using a trilayer WSe_2
gate, achieving a density modulation amplitude exceeding 2 10^{12} cm^{-2}.
Moreover, the observed ambipolar gate-voltage response allows to extract the
energy gap of WSe_2 yielding a value of 1.05 eV. Our results will provide an
additional tuning knob to cryogenic near-field experiments on emerging
phenomena in two-dimensional materials and moir\'e material heterostructures.

the so-called geometric conservation law, which helps to avoid spurious
oscillations while solving the governing equations over dynamic domains. This

variations in the offering and bidding curves may substantially modify the

share may imply that her offering strategy can alter the marginal price
formation, which can be used to increase profit. We tackle this problem from a
novel perspective. First, we propose a optimization-based methodology to
summarize each GENCO's step-wise supply curves into a subset of representative
price-energy blocks. Then, the relationship between the market price and the
resulting energy block offering prices is modeled through a Bayesian linear
regression approach, which also allows us to generate stochastic scenarios for
the sensibility of the market towards the GENCO strategy, represented by the
regression coefficient probabilistic distributions. Finally, this predictive
model is embedded in the stochastic optimization model by employing a
constraint learning approach. Results show how allowing the GENCO to deviate
from her true marginal costs renders significant changes in her profits and the
market marginal price. Furthermore, these results have also been tested in an
out-of-sample validation setting, showing how this optimal offering strategy is
also effective in a real-world market contest.

possible. A class of the latter assumes a conformal/disformal coupling that
leads to a fifth force on the dark matter component, which consequently does
not follow the same geodesics as the other (baryonic, radiation, and dark

singularities of the standard matter frame are seen from the dark matter one,
concluding that by choosing an appropriate coupling, dark matter observers will
see no singularities but a non-beginning, non-ending universe. By considering
two simple phenomenological models we show that such a type of coupling can fit
observational data as well as the usual $\Lambda$CDM model.

predictions as compared with models that use GE alone. We use two methods to
address the limited number of response values: 1) homogenize drug

into a single dataset, 2) augment drug-pair samples by switching the order of
drug features which doubles the sample size of all drug-pair samples. These
methods enable us to combine single-drug and drug-pair treatments, allowing us
to train multimodal and unimodal neural networks (NNs) without changing

analogue of MaxSNP, which includes a large number of well-studied problems
(including Nearest and Furthest Neighbor in the Hamming metric, Maximum Inner

MaxSP$_k$ denotes the class of $O(m^k)$-time problems of the form
$\max_{x_1,\dots, x_k} \#\{y:\phi(x_1,\dots,x_k,y)\}$ where $\phi$ is a

  * optimizable to exactness in time $O(m^{k-\delta})$,
  * an (inefficient) approximation scheme, i.e., a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation

  * a (fixed) constant-factor approximation in time $O(m^{k-\delta})$, or

system. In fluid dynamics, extreme events can have adverse effects on the
system's optimal design and operability, which calls for accurate methods for
their prediction and control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven
methodology for the prediction and control of extreme events in a chaotic shear
flow. The approach is based on echo state networks, which are a type of
reservoir computing that learn temporal correlations within a time-dependent
dataset. The objective is five-fold. First, we exploit ad-hoc metrics from
binary classification to analyse (i) how many of the extreme events predicted
by the network actually occur in the test set (precision), and (ii) how many
extreme events are missed by the network (recall). We apply a principled
strategy for optimal hyperparameter selection, which is key to the networks'
performance. Second, we focus on the time-accurate prediction of extreme
events. We show that echo state networks are able to predict extreme events
well beyond the predictability time, i.e., up to more than five Lyapunov times.
Third, we focus on the long-term prediction of extreme events from a
statistical point of view. By training the networks with datasets that contain
non-converged statistics, we show that the networks are able to learn and
extrapolate the flow's long-term statistics. In other words, the networks are
able to extrapolate in time from relatively short time series. Fourth, we
design a simple and effective control strategy to prevent extreme events from
occurring. The control strategy decreases the occurrence of extreme events up
to one order of magnitude with respect to the uncontrolled system. Finally, we
analyse the robustness of the results for a range of Reynolds numbers. We show
that the networks perform well across a wide range of regimes.

thermal flux is usually modeled using Spitzer's theory, which is based on local
Coulomb collisions between the electrons carrying the thermal flux and those in
the background. However, often during flares, temperature gradients become
sufficiently steep that the collisional mean free path exceeds the temperature
gradient scale size, so that thermal conduction becomes inherently non-local.
Further, turbulent angular scattering, which is detectable in nonthermal widths
of atomic emission lines, can also act to increase the collision frequency and
so suppress the heat flux. Recent work by Emslie & Bian (2018) extended
Spitzer's theory of thermal conduction to account for both non-locality and
turbulent suppression. We have implemented their theoretical expression for the
heat flux (which is a convolution of the Spitzer flux with a kernel function)
into the RADYN flare-modeling code and performed a parameter study to
understand how the resulting changes in thermal conduction affect flare
dynamics and hence the radiation produced. We find that models with reduced
heat fluxes predict slower bulk flows, less intense line emission, and longer
cooling times. By comparing features of atomic emission lines predicted by the
models with Doppler velocities and nonthermal line widths deduced from a
particular flare observation, we find that models with suppression factors
between 0.3 to 0.5 relative to the Spitzer value best reproduce observed
Doppler velocities across emission lines forming over a wide range of
temperatures. Interestingly, the model that best matches observed nonthermal
line widths has a kappa-type velocity distribution function.

variations of M dwarfs, which are induced by orbiting planets. However, there
are other potential sources of such variations, including rotational modulation
caused by stellar activity. We aim to investigate four M dwarfs (Ross 318, YZ
CMi, TYC 3529-1437-1, and EV Lac) with different activity levels and spectral
sub-types. Our goal is to compare the periodicities seen in 22 activity
indicators and the stellar RVs, and to examine their stability over time. For
each star, we calculated GLS periodograms of pseudo-equivalent widths of
chromospheric lines, indices of photospheric bands, the differential line width
as a measure of the width of the average photospheric absorption line, the RV,
the chromatic index that describes the wavelength dependence of the RV, and CCF
parameters. We also calculated periodograms for subsets of the data and
compared our results to TESS photometry. We find the rotation periods of all
four stars to manifest themselves in the RV and photospheric indicators,
particularly the TiO~7050 index, whereas the chromospheric lines show clear
signals only at lower activity levels. For EV Lac and TYC 3529-1437-1, we find
episodes during which indicators vary with the rotation period, and episodes
during which they vary with half the rotation period, similarly to photometric
light curves. The changing periodicities reflect the evolution of stellar
activity features on the stellar surface. We therefore conclude that our
results not only emphasise the importance of carefully analysing indicators
complementary to the RV in RV surveys, but they also suggest that it is also
useful to search for signals in activity indicators in subsets of the dataset,
because an activity signal that is present in the RV may not be visible in the
activity indicators all the time, in particular for the most active stars.

clouds linked with the negative metallicity gradient. Recent infrared surveys
provide an overview of dust emission in large sections of the Galaxy, but
suffer from cloud confusion and poor spatial resolution at far-infrared

stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy, and use it

standard color-color and color-magnitude diagrams in search for YSOs in the

the Outer Galaxy' survey. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm
is used to identify clusters, along with the Robitaille et al. (2017) code to
calculate physical properties of individual YSOs. We identify 13 Class I and 13
Class II YSO candidates using the color-color diagrams, and additional 2 and 21
sources, respectively, using the machine learning techniques. Spectral energy
distributions of 23 sources are modelled with a star and a passive disk,
corresponding to Class II objects. Models of 3 sources include envelopes
typical for Class I objects. The objects are grouped in 2 clusters located at
the distance of ~2.2 kpc, and 5 clusters at ~5.6 kpc. The spatial extent of CO,
radio continuum, and dust emission confirms the origin of YSOs in two distinct
star-forming regions along a similar line-of-sight. The outer Galaxy might
serve as a unique laboratory of star formation across environments on condition
that complementary methods and ancillary data are used to properly account for
cloud confusion and distance uncertainties.

pose estimation from the first touch for known objects. Given the object
geometry, we learn a tailored perception model in simulation that estimates a
probability distribution over possible object poses given a tactile
observation. To do so, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of
object poses would produce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape
obtained from the sensor, we match it against the pre-computed set using an
object-specific embedding learned using contrastive learning. We obtain contact
shapes from the sensor with an object-agnostic calibration step that maps RGB
tactile observations to binary contact shapes. This mapping, which can be
reused across object and sensor instances, is the only step trained with real
sensor data. This results in a perception model that localizes objects from the
first real tactile observation. Importantly, it produces pose distributions and
can incorporate additional pose constraints coming from other perception
systems, contacts, or priors.
  We provide quantitative results for 20 objects. Tac2Pose provides high
accuracy pose estimations from distinctive tactile observations while
regressing meaningful pose distributions to account for those contact shapes
that could result from different object poses. We also test Tac2Pose on object
models reconstructed from a 3D scanner, to evaluate the robustness to
uncertainty in the object model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of
Tac2Pose compared with three baseline methods for tactile pose estimation:
directly regressing the object pose with a neural network, matching an observed
contact to a set of possible contacts using a standard classification neural
network, and direct pixel comparison of an observed contact with a set of

system, while an attack graph is a type of a threat scenario model. In an
attack graph, nodes are privilege states of the attacker, edges are
vulnerabilities escalating privileges, and controls reduce the probabilities of
some vulnerabilities being exploited. The tool builds on an optimisation
algorithm published by Khouzani et al. (2019), enabling a user to quickly

how core constraints interact with different core-selecting payment rules. In
particular, we examine the natural and desirable non-decreasing property of

increasing their bids. Previous work showed that, in general, the widely used
VCG-nearest payment rule violates the non-decreasing property in single-minded

payment rule is non-decreasing. In order to determine in which auctions single
effective core constraints occur, we introduce a conflict graph representation
of single-minded CAs and find sufficient conditions for the single effective
core constraint in CAs. Finally, we study the consequences on the behavior of
the bidders and show that no over-bidding exists in any Nash equilibrium for
non-decreasing core-selecting payment rules.

simple rectangular shallow reservoirs, recent laboratory experiments show that
the developing flow fields are particularly complex, involving large-scale
turbulent structures. For specific combinations of reservoir size and hydraulic
conditions, a meandering jet can be observed. While some aspects of this
pseudo-2D flow pattern can be reproduced using a 2D numerical model, new 3D
simulations, based on the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations,
show consistent advantages as presented herein. A Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition was used to characterize the four most energetic modes of the
meandering jet at the free surface level, allowing comparison against
experimental data and 2D (depth-averaged) numerical results. Three different
isotropic eddy viscosity models (RNG k-${\epsilon}$, k-${\epsilon}$,
k-${\omega}$) were tested. The 3D models accurately predicted the frequency of
the modes, whereas the amplitudes of the modes and associated energy were
damped for the friction-dominant cases and augmented for non-frictional ones.
The performance of the three turbulence models remained essentially similar,
with slightly better predictions by RNG k-${\epsilon}$ model in the case with
the highest Reynolds number. Finally, the Q-criterion was used to identify
vortices and study their dynamics, assisting on the identification of the
differences between: i) the three-dimensional phenomenon (here reproduced), ii)
its two-dimensional footprint in the free surface (experimental observations)
and iii) the depth-averaged case (represented by 2D models).

stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with multiplicative noise,
where the diffusion coefficient is spatially multiscale and the noise
perturbation nonlinearly depends on the diffusion dynamics. It is necessary to
efficiently compute all possible trajectories of the stochastic dynamics for
quantifying model's uncertainty and statistic moments. The multiscale diffusion
and nonlinearity may cause the computation intractable. To overcome the
multiscale difficulty, a constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale
finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) is used to localize the computation and
obtain an effective coarse model. However, the nonlinear terms are still
defined on a fine scale space after the Galerkin projection of CEM-GMsFEM is
applied to the nonlinear SPDEs. This significantly impacts on the simulation
efficiency by CEM-GMsFEM. To this end, a stochastic online discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM) is proposed to treat the stochastic nonlinearity.
The stochastic online DEIM incorporates offline snapshots and online snapshots.
The offline snapshots consist of the nonlinear terms at the approximate mean of
the stochastic dynamics and are used to construct an offline reduced model. The
online snapshots contain some information of the current new trajectory and are
used to correct the offline reduced model in an increment manner. The
stochastic online DEIM substantially reduces the dimension of the nonlinear
dynamics and enhances the prediction accuracy for the reduced model. Thus, the
online multiscale model reduction is constructed by using CEM-GMsFEM and the
stochastic online DEIM. A priori error analysis is carried out for the
nonlinear SPDEs. We present a few numerical examples with diffusion in
heterogeneous porous media and show the effectiveness of the proposed model
reduction.

reconstruction of the Galactic dust distribution with an increase in the number
of meaningful resolution elements by orders of magnitude with respect to
previous reconstructions, while taking advantage of the dust's spatial
correlations to inform the dust map. We use iterative grid refinement to define
a log-normal process in spherical coordinates. This log-normal process assumes
a fixed correlation structure, which was inferred in an earlier reconstruction
of Galactic dust. Our map is informed through 111 Million data points,
combining data of PANSTARRS, 2MASS, Gaia DR2 and ALLWISE. The log-normal
process is discretized to 122 Billion degrees of freedom, a factor of 400 more
than our previous map. We derive the most probable posterior map and an
uncertainty estimate using natural gradient descent and the Fisher-Laplace
approximation. The dust reconstruction covers a quarter of the volume of our
Galaxy, with a maximum coordinate distance of $16\,\text{kpc}$, and meaningful
information can be found up to at distances of $4\,$kpc, still improving upon
our earlier map by a factor of 5 in maximal distance, of $900$ in volume, and
of about eighteen in angular grid resolution. Unfortunately, the maximum
posterior approach chosen to make the reconstruction computational affordable
introduces artifacts and reduces the accuracy of our uncertainty estimate.
Despite of the apparent limitations of the presented 3D dust map, a good part
of the reconstructed structures are confirmed by independent maser
observations. Thus, the map is a step towards reliable 3D Galactic cartography
and already can serve for a number of tasks, if used with care.

accelerate the convergence of supervised training even faster (1.40$\times$)

$\beta$-detector efficiency, influencing the $\beta$-intensity distribution
obtained. Our results for $^{96\text{gs}}$Y (0$^+$) confirm the large ground
state to ground state $\beta$-intensity probability, although a slightly larger
value than reported in previous studies was obtained, amounting to
$96.6_{-2.1}^{+0.3}\%$ of the total $\beta$ intensity. Given that the decay of
$^{96\text{gs}}$Y is the second most important contributor to the reactor
antineutrino spectrum between 5 and 7 MeV, the impact of the present results on
reactor antineutrino summation calculations has been evaluated. In the decay of
$^{96\text{m}}$Y (8$^{+}$), previously undetected $\beta$ intensity in
transitions to states above 6 MeV has been observed. This shows the importance
of total absorption $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy measurements of $\beta$ decays
with highly fragmented de-excitation patterns. $^{96\text{m}}$Y (8$^{+}$) is a
major contributor to reactor decay heat in uranium-plutonium and
thorium-uranium fuels around 10 s after fission pulses, and the newly measured
average $\beta$ and $\gamma$ energies differ significantly from the previous
values in evaluated databases (...)

show that Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic observations, together with imaging

Observatory, we found clear blue-shifted secondary emission components in
extreme ultraviolet spectral lines during a solar eruption on October 28, 2021.
From simultaneous imaging observations, we found that the secondary components
are caused by a mass ejection from the flare site. We estimated the
line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the ejecta from both the double Gaussian
fitting method and the red-blue asymmetry analysis. The results of both methods
agree well with each other, giving an average LOS velocity of the plasma of
$\sim 423~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$. From the $304$ \AA~image series taken by the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory-A
(STEREO-A) spacecraft, we estimated the plane-of-sky (POS) velocity from the
STEREO-A viewpoint {to be around $587~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$}. The full velocity of
the bulk motion of the ejecta was then computed by combining the imaging and
spectroscopic observations, which turns out to be around $596~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$
with an angle of $42.4^\circ$ to the west of the Sun-Earth line and
$16.0^\circ$ south to the ecliptic plane.

scale of acquired 3D point clouds poses a challenge to the existing data

leverage temporal correlations within a point cloud sequence for effective
dynamic point cloud compression. In this paper, we study the attribute (e.g.,
color) compression of dynamic point clouds and present a learning-based
framework, termed 4DAC. To reduce temporal redundancy within data, we first
build the 3D motion estimation and motion compensation modules with deep neural
networks. Then, the attribute residuals produced by the motion compensation
component are encoded by the region adaptive hierarchical transform into
residual coefficients. In addition, we also propose a deep conditional entropy
model to estimate the probability distribution of the transformed coefficients,
by incorporating temporal context from consecutive point clouds and the motion

coded with the predicted distribution. Extensive experiments on several public

with default input parameters of TALYS we observed substantial deviations
between the predicted cross sections and experimental data. Then, using
modified optical model potential and nuclear level deformation parameters as

shaping the temporal, spectral, phase, amplitude, and farfield characteristics

circumvents prior limitations caused by the phase-delay mismatch in

merger mass shows exceptionally different behavior for the models that we adopt
for our analysis. In the local universe (z=0) the average merger mass changes
from Mtot,int=25Msun for CE binary evolution and open clusters formation
channels, to Mtot,int=30Msun for the stable-RLOF binary channel, to

more pronounced at larger redshifts. However, these differences are diminished
when considering LVK O3 detector sensitivity. Comparison with LVK O3 data shows
that none of our adopted models can match the data despite large errors on
BH-BH masses and redshifts. We emphasize that our conclusions are derived from
a small set of 6 models that are subject to numerous known uncertainties. We
also note that BH-BH mergers may originate from a mix of several channels and

research since the 1990s and the deregulation of the traditionally monopolistic
and government-controlled power sectors. Although it aims at predicting both
spot and forward prices, the vast majority of research is focused on short-term
horizons which exhibit dynamics unlike in any other market. The reason is that
power system stability calls for a constant balance between production and
consumption, while being weather (both demand and supply) and business activity
(demand only) dependent. The recent market innovations do not help in this
respect. The rapid expansion of intermittent renewable energy sources is not
offset by the costly increase of electricity storage capacities and
modernization of the grid infrastructure. On the methodological side, this
leads to three visible trends in electricity price forecasting research as of
2022. Firstly, there is a slow, but more noticeable with every year, tendency
to consider not only point but also probabilistic (interval, density) or even
path (also called ensemble) forecasts. Secondly, there is a clear shift from
the relatively parsimonious econometric (or statistical) models towards more
complex and harder to comprehend, but more versatile and eventually more
accurate statistical/machine learning approaches. Thirdly, statistical error
measures are nowadays regarded as only the first evaluation step. Since they
may not necessarily reflect the economic value of reducing prediction errors,
more and more often, they are complemented by case studies comparing profits
from scheduling or trading strategies based on price forecasts obtained from
different models.

prediction is a challenging data mining task due to the complex relations
between medical codes. Most existing studies focus on utilizing inherent
relations between homogeneous codes of medical ontology graph to enhance their
representations using supervised methods, and few studies pay attention to the
valuable relations between heterogeneous or homogeneous medical codes from
history EMRs, which further limits the prediction performance and application
scenarios. Therefore, to address these limitations, this paper proposes
KnowAugNet, a multi-sourced medical knowledge augmented medication prediction
network which can fully capture the diverse relations between medical codes via
multi-level graph contrastive learning framework. Specifically, KnowAugNet
first leverages the graph contrastive learning using graph attention network as
the encoder to capture the implicit relations between homogeneous medical codes
from the medical ontology graph and obtains the knowledge augmented medical
codes embedding vectors. Then, it utilizes the graph contrastive learning using
a weighted graph convolutional network as the encoder to capture the
correlative relations between homogeneous or heterogeneous medical codes from
the constructed medical prior relation graph and obtains the relation augmented
medical codes embedding vectors. Finally, the augmented medical codes embedding
vectors and the supervised medical codes embedding vectors are retrieved and
input to the sequential learning network to capture the temporal relations of
medical codes and predict medications for patients.

Therefore, it is crucial to develop tools and strategies to detect the

detection strategy to distinguish between real and virtual video conferencing
user backgrounds. We demonstrate that our detector is robust against two attack
scenarios. The first scenario considers the case where the detector is unaware

performance is significant against the CRSPAM1372 [2] features, and
post-processing operations such as geometric transformations with different
quality factors that the attacker may choose. Moreover, our performance results

The aim is to provide additional information to the limited literature on the
measurement uncertainties of these SNQs by use of both analytical developments
and a stochastic approach based on simulations. The accuracy of the analytical
developments was studied thanks to simulations of the sound propagation within
a series of offices (1 layout, 16 acoustic configurations with different screen
heights and different acoustic qualities of screens and ceiling). The SNQs
obtained in the simulations cover a wide range: D 2S between 3.4 and 7.5 dB(A),
L pAS4m between 40.6 and 51.9 dB(A) and r c between 2.5 and 14.7 m. Therefore,
the simulations are representative of a broad set of acoustic qualities.
Estimated uncertainties have a magnitude of 0.4 dB(A) for D 2S and vary between
0.4 and 0.7 dB(A) for L pAS4m and between 0.2 and 1.5 m for r c over a
measurement path comprising 7 measurement positions. The simulations also raise
the question of describing the acoustic quality of an office using a single
value for the indicators. The results of the simulations show that in some
cases, D 2S values significantly depend on the measurement path, leading to a
strong increase of its measurement uncertainty if a unique value is to be
considered.

theoretical guarantees for efficient recovery from compressed linear
measurements have been developed for signals in the range of a ReLU network

larger than the previous one by a logarithmic factor. It was later shown that
constant expansivity is sufficient for recovery. It has remained open whether
the expansivity can be relaxed, allowing for networks with contractive layers
(as often the case of real generators). In this work we answer this question,
proving that a signal in the range of a Gaussian generative network can be
recovered from few linear measurements provided that the width of the layers is
proportional to the input layer size (up to log factors). This condition allows
the generative network to have contractive layers. Our result is based on
showing that Gaussian matrices satisfy a matrix concentration inequality which
we term Range Restricted Weight Distribution Condition (R2WDC) and that weakens
the Weight Distribution Condition (WDC) upon which previous theoretical
guarantees were based. The WDC has also been used to analyze other signal
recovery problems with generative network priors. By replacing the WDC with the

improves the accuracy for traffic sign classification compared to the
traditional defense methods (i.e., JPEG filtering, feature squeezing, binary

Considering the decentralized computing topology, privacy has become a

study the \textit{privacy-aware server to multi-agent assignment} problem

zero-valent iron (ZVI) nanoparticles (NPs) for bioremediation applications. The
ZVI-NPs were fabricated by chemical reduction using a ferrous salt solution
with poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), used as a stabilizer. The synthesis was
conducted with and without ultrasonic treatment. The ZVI NPs were fabricated
and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, and Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Experimental observations demonstrate
that depending on synthesis conditions and coordination of stabilizers, NPs
with different morphologies are formed. Colloidal solutions of the synthesized
NPs were used in antimicrobial activity tests and biofilm formation assays for
nine different control microorganisms: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15692), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29122),
Klebsiella pneumoniae (laboratory isolates), Proteus vulgaris (laboratory
isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Bacillus cereus (DSMZ 4312),
Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). All control
strains did not show antibacterial effect against PVP-stabilized ZVI NPs
synthesized without ultrasonic treatment. However, biofilm results show that
the highest absorbance values of the micro-organisms were tested in control
wells.

  Post-Wildfire Mudflow Composition","19 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper shows critical new insights into how air entrapment affects the
properties of rain-induced post-wildfire mudflows as a mixture of air bubbles,
water, and hydrophobic sand. The idea of mudflows' internal structure
containing trapped air bubbles is novel. Such mixtures can flow down slopes at
incredible speeds, quickly blasting obstacles on the way and carrying large
stone boulders and objects. The surficial soil particles turn hydrophobic due
to the deposition of combusted organic matter during wildfires. Afterward,
raindrops, splash, and erosion form devastating mudflows. We propose a new
paradigm in which a significant amount of air remains entrapped in
post-wildfire mudflow via hydrophobic particle-air attraction. Specific
findings quantify the amount of air trapped within sand-water volumetric
concentrations, the effect of intermixing energy, gravity, and sand particle
size on outcome mudflow internal structure. As a result, little agglomerates of
sand particles covering air bubbles characterize the mudflow mixture's internal
structure.

could help advance research in many different areas (e.g. by applying opinion
mining, emotion/sentiment analysis, and statistical analysis) such as business
and finance, health, socio-economic inequality and gender vulnerability. User
demographics provide rich information that could help study the subject
further. However, user demographics such as gender are considered private and
are not freely available. In this study, we propose a model based on
transformers to predict the user's gender from their images and tweets. We
fine-tune a model based on Vision Transformers (ViT) to stratify female and
male images. Next, we fine-tune another model based on Bidirectional Encoders
Representations from Transformers (BERT) to recognize the user's gender by
their tweets. This is highly beneficial, because not all users provide an image
that indicates their gender. The gender of such users could be detected form
their tweets. The combination model improves the accuracy of image and text
classification models by 6.98% and 4.43%, respectively. This shows that the
image and text classification models are capable of complementing each other by
providing additional information to one another. We apply our method to the
PAN-2018 dataset, and obtain an accuracy of 85.52%.

different physical certification tests are set up on test tracks to assess
required safety levels. These approaches are well suited for vehicles with
limited complexity and limited interactions with other entities as last-second
resources. However, these approaches do not allow to evaluate safety with real
behaviors for critical and edge cases, nor to evaluate the ability to
anticipate them in the mid or long term. This is particularly relevant for
automated and autonomous driving functions that make use of advanced predictive
systems to anticipate future actions and motions to be considered in the path
planning layer. In this paper, we present and analyze the results of physical
tests on proving grounds of several predictive systems in automated driving
functions developed within the framework of the BRAVE project. Based on our
experience in testing predictive automated driving functions, we identify the
main limitations of current physical testing approaches when dealing with
predictive systems, analyze the main challenges ahead, and provide a set of
practical actions and recommendations to consider in future physical testing
procedures for automated and autonomous driving functions.

  Human Gaze?","Accepted to ACL 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learned self-attention functions in state-of-the-art NLP models often
correlate with human attention. We investigate whether self-attention in
large-scale pre-trained language models is as predictive of human eye fixation
patterns during task-reading as classical cognitive models of human attention.
We compare attention functions across two task-specific reading datasets for
sentiment analysis and relation extraction. We find the predictiveness of
large-scale pre-trained self-attention for human attention depends on `what is
in the tail', e.g., the syntactic nature of rare contexts. Further, we observe
that task-specific fine-tuning does not increase the correlation with human
task-specific reading. Through an input reduction experiment we give
complementary insights on the sparsity and fidelity trade-off, showing that
lower-entropy attention vectors are more faithful.
