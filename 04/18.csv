billions of devices. Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) variant aims at improving power
consumption on battery-constrained devices. BLE-enabled devices broadcast
information (e.g., as beacons) to nearby devices via advertisements.
Unfortunately, such functionality can become a double-edged sword at the hands
of attackers. In this paper, we primarily show how an attacker can exploit BLE
advertisements to exfiltrate information from BLE-enable devices. In
particular, our attack establishes a communication medium between two devices
without requiring any prior authentication or pairing. We develop a
proof-of-concept attack framework on the Android ecosystem and assess its
performance via a thorough set of experiments. Our results indicate that such
an exfiltration attack is indeed possible though with a limited data rate.
Nevertheless, we also demonstrate potential use cases and enhancements to our
attack that can further its severeness. Finally, we discuss possible
countermeasures to prevent such an attack.

change over time, continual learning is key for ensuring the safe use of deep
neural networks. Yet most existing work focuses on convolutional architectures
and image classification. Instead, radiologists prefer to work with
segmentation models that outline specific regions-of-interest, for which
Transformer-based architectures are gaining traction. The self-attention
mechanism of Transformers could potentially mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
opening the way for more robust medical image segmentation. In this work, we
explore how recently-proposed Transformer mechanisms for semantic segmentation
behave in sequential learning scenarios, and analyse how best to adapt
continual learning strategies for this setting. Our evaluation on hippocampus
segmentation shows that Transformer mechanisms mitigate catastrophic forgetting
for medical image segmentation compared to purely convolutional architectures,
and demonstrates that regularising ViT modules should be done with caution.

[1982], agents have private signals that capture their information about
different social alternatives, and the valuation of every agent is a function
of all agent signals. While interdependence has been mainly studied for
auctions, it is extremely relevant for a large variety of social choice
settings, including the canonical setting of public projects. The IDV model is
very challenging relative to standard independent private values, and welfare
guarantees have been achieved through two alternative conditions known as {\em
single-crossing} and {\em submodularity over signals (SOS)}. In either case,
the existing theory falls short of solving the public projects setting.
  Our contribution is twofold: (i) We give a workable characterization of
truthfulness for IDV public projects for the largest class of valuations for
which such a characterization exists, and term this class \emph{decomposable
valuations}; (ii) We provide possibility and impossibility results for welfare
approximation in public projects with SOS valuations. Our main impossibility
result is that, in contrast to auctions, no universally truthful mechanism
performs better for public projects with SOS valuations than choosing a project
at random. Our main positive result applies to {\em excludable} public projects
with SOS, for which we establish a constant factor approximation similar to
auctions. Our results suggest that exclusion may be a key tool for achieving
welfare guarantees in the IDV model.

same upper bound on the growth order is obtained for the restricted weak-$L^p$
type norm, and which was the strongest quantitative bound prior to our result.
Furthermore, our sparse $(p,1)$-norms bound imply new and stronger results at
the endpoint $p=1$. In particular, we obtain that the Fourier series of
functions from the weighted Arias de Reyna space $ QA_{\infty}(w) $, which
contains the weighted Antonov space $L\log L\log\log\log L(\mathbb T; w)$,
converge almost everywhere whenever $w\in A_1$. This is an extension of the

The proof of the Carleson embedding relies on a newly developed smooth

discover three different mechanisms that can stabilize the junction of ELs and
therefore guarantee the formation of various types of exceptional chains (ECs)

predict that these experiments will not have a positive result, and for
$\psi$-supplemented models there may be arguments for either outcome. We
suggest that a positive outcome to these experimenst would rule out a class of
quantum gravity models that we refer to as $\psi$-incomplete quantum gravity

make these sorts of approaches more appealing, and finally we discuss a
cosmological phenomenon which could be regarded as providing evidence for PIQG

attention is given to the characterization of the low-frequency dynamics of the
separation bubbles using flow visualization, spectral analysis, space-time
cross correlations, and flow modal decomposition. The mean flowfield shows
different shock structures formed on both sides of the airfoil. On the suction
side, an oblique shock impinges on the turbulent boundary layer, whereas a Mach
reflection interacts with the pressure side boundary layer. The interactions
taking place in the present turbine cascade show similarities and discrepancies
with respect to more canonical cases. For example, the characteristic
frequencies of the shock/bubble motions are comparable to those described in
the literature of canonical cases. However, the suction side bubble leads to
compression waves that do not coalesce into a separation shock, and a thin
bubble forms on the pressure side despite the strong normal shock from the Mach
reflection. Instantaneous flow visualizations illustrate elongated streamwise
structures on the incoming boundary layers and their interactions with the
shocks and separation bubbles. The space-time cross-correlations reveal that
the near-wall streaks drive the motion of the suction side separation bubble,
which in turn promotes oscillations of the reattachment shock and shear layer
flapping. Organized motions in the SBLIs and their corresponding characteristic
frequencies and spatial support are identified using proper orthogonal
decomposition.

In the dual field theory, the model describes the heavy mesons inside a finite

temperature. Then, at finite temperature, we obtain the spectral functions,
where the heavy vector meson are represented by peaks. We show that the
charmonium melts down at temperatures above the confinement/deconfinement
temperature of the quark-gluon plasma. We also observe that the chemical
potential speeds up the melting process. This finding is in agreement with
results previously reported in the literature. In the gravitational side of the
theory, we solve the perturbation equations in the hydrodynamics limit. From
this result, we read off the diffusion coefficient by comparing the dispersion
relation against the corresponding result obtained in the dual field theory. We
also investigate the behavior of the diffusion coefficient as a function of the
temperature. The perturbation equations are solved numerically, in order to get
the quasinormal frequencies. We report the emergence of a new mode whose real
part increases rapidly at a certain value of the chemical potential while its
imaginary part decreases with the increasing of the chemical potential.
Finally, by comparing against results obtained in the conformal plasma, we
observe that the real part of the frequency increases, while the imaginary part
decreases when we consider the non-conformal plasma.

for mapping the weights to the flash transistor threshold voltages are
presented. The threshold voltages are determined to maximize both the

and are designed to allow commercial synthesis and P&R tools to automatically
use them in synthesis of ASICs. Substantial reductions in area and power
without sacrificing performance are demonstrated on several ASIC benchmarks by
the automatic embedding of FTL cells. The paper also demonstrates how FTL cells

of the resonance chain $p:p:p+1$, where the co-orbital pair is in a first-order
mean motion resonance with the outermost third planet. Our model takes into
account tidal dissipation through the use of a Hamiltonian version of the
constant time-lag model, which extends the Hamiltonian formalism of the
point-mass case. We show the existence of several families of equilibria, and
how these equilibria extend to the complete system. In one family, which we
call the main branch, a secular resonance between the libration frequency of
the co-orbitals and the precession frequency of the pericentres has unexpected
dynamical consequences when tidal dissipation is added. We report the existence
of two distinct mechanisms that make co-orbital planets much more stable within
the $p:p:p+1$ resonance chain rather than outside it. The first one is due to
negative real parts of the eigenvalues of the linearised system with tides, in
the region of the secular resonance mentioned above. The second one comes from
non-linear contributions of the vector field and it is due to eccentricity
damping. These two stabilising mechanisms increase the chances of a
still-to-come detection of exoplanets in the co-orbital configuration.

Hausa, Nigerian Pidgin English, Kinyarwanda & Yor\`ub\'a. These datasets
consist of 1,500 turns each, which we translate from a portion of the English
multi-domain MultiWOZ dataset. Subsequently, we investigate & analyze the
effectiveness of modelling through transfer learning by utilziing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) deep monolingual models: DialoGPT and BlenderBot. We
compare the models with a simple seq2seq baseline using perplexity. Besides
this, we conduct human evaluation of single-turn conversations by using
majority votes and measure inter-annotator agreement (IAA). We find that the
hypothesis that deep monolingual models learn some abstractions that generalize
across languages holds. We observe human-like conversations, to different
degrees, in 5 out of the 6 languages. The language with the most transferable
properties is the Nigerian Pidgin English, with a human-likeness score of
78.1%, of which 34.4% are unanimous. We freely provide the datasets and host
the model checkpoints/demos on the HuggingFace hub for public access.

  Images, Pose Noise",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We propose a novel framework to learn 3D point cloud semantics from 2D
multi-view image observations containing pose error. On the one hand, directly
learning from the massive, unstructured and unordered 3D point cloud is
computationally and algorithmically more difficult than learning from
compactly-organized and context-rich 2D RGB images. On the other hand, both
LiDAR point cloud and RGB images are captured in standard automated-driving
datasets. This motivates us to conduct a ""task transfer"" paradigm so that 3D
semantic segmentation benefits from aggregating 2D semantic cues, albeit pose
noises are contained in 2D image observations. Among all difficulties, pose
noise and erroneous prediction from 2D semantic segmentation approaches are the
main challenges for the task transfer. To alleviate the influence of those
factor, we perceive each 3D point using multi-view images and for each single
image a patch observation is associated. Moreover, the semantic labels of a
block of neighboring 3D points are predicted simultaneously, enabling us to
exploit the point structure prior to further improve the performance. A
hierarchical full attention network~(HiFANet) is designed to sequentially
aggregates patch, bag-of-frames and inter-point semantic cues, with
hierarchical attention mechanism tailored for different level of semantic cues.
Also, each preceding attention block largely reduces the feature size before
feeding to the next attention block, making our framework slim. Experiment
results on Semantic-KITTI show that the proposed framework outperforms existing
3D point cloud based methods significantly, it requires much less training data
and exhibits tolerance to pose noise. The code is available at

across many neurological conditions. However, the relationship between
structure and function -- their coupling -- is relatively unexplored,
particularly in the context of an intervention. Epilepsy surgery alters the
brain structure and networks to control the functional abnormality of seizures.
Given that surgery is a structural modification aiming to alter the function,
we hypothesized that stronger structure-function coupling preoperatively is
associated with a greater chance of post-operative seizure control. We
constructed structural and functional brain networks in 39 subjects with
medication-resistant focal epilepsy using data from intracranial EEG
(pre-surgery), structural MRI (pre-and post-surgery), and diffusion MRI
(pre-surgery). We investigated pre-operative structure-function coupling at two
spatial scales a) at the global iEEG network level and b) at the resolution of
individual iEEG electrode contacts using virtual surgeries. At global network
level, seizure-free individuals had stronger structure-function coupling
pre-operatively than those that were not seizure-free regardless of the choice
of interictal segment or frequency band. At the resolution of individual iEEG
contacts, the virtual surgery approach provided complementary information to
localize epileptogenic tissues. In predicting seizure outcomes,
structure-function coupling measures were more important than clinical
attributes, and together they predicted seizure outcomes with an accuracy of
85% and sensitivity of 87%. The underlying assumption that the structural
changes induced by surgery translate to the functional level to control
seizures is valid when the structure-functional coupling is strong. Mapping the
regions that contribute to structure-functional coupling using virtual
surgeries may help aid surgical planning.

re-entrant at a half-flux periodicity, where the effective twofold rotation is
preserved. In addition, numerous replicas of the original HOTIs are found for
fluxes without protecting symmetries. Similar to the original HOTIs, replica
HOTIs feature both localized corner states and edge-localized real-space

the DM decay/annihilation. The BDM interaction cross-sections considered are of

have a considerable impact on the temperature and ionization histories at low

first decomposing them into salient parts, and then encoding each part as a

We find that this type of learning inspired by human cognition can overcome
hurdles faced by deep convolutional networks in low-shot generalization tasks,
like zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and unsupervised domain adaptation.
Furthermore, we find a classifier using an RPC image encoder is fairly robust
to adversarial attacks, that deep neural networks are known to be prone to.
Given that our image encoding principle is based on human cognition, one would
expect the encodings to be interpretable by humans, which we find to be the
case via crowd-sourcing experiments. Finally, we propose an application of
these interpretable encodings in the form of generating synthetic attribute

resorting to the integral representation of the quark self-energy and

renormalization. The parameters of the model are chosen such that the gluon
mass scale is consistent with recent lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations, the
Pauli-Villars mass is lowered down to about 1 GeV to concentrate strength in
the infrared momentum region, and the coupling constant and renormalized mass

identification during the past decade. In the resulting framework, the impulse
response estimation problem is formulated as a regularized optimization defined
on an infinite-dimensional RKHS consisting of stable impulse responses. The
consequent estimation problem is well-defined under the central assumption that
the convolution operators restricted to the RKHS are continuous linear
functionals. Moreover, according to this assumption, the representer theorem
hold, and therefore, the impulse response can be estimated by solving a
finite-dimensional program. Thus, the continuity feature plays a significant
role in kernel-based system identification. This paper shows that this central
assumption is guaranteed to be satisfied in considerably general situations,
namely when the kernel is an integrable function and the input signal is
bounded. Furthermore, the strong convexity of the optimization problem and the
continuity property of the convolution operators imply that the kernel-based
system identification admits a unique solution. Consequently, it follows that
kernel-based system identification is a well-defined approach.

More frequent sterilization of surgical masks is needed to protect the wearers.
However, it is challenging to sterilize the commodity surgical masks with a
fast and effective method. Herein, we reported the sterilization of the
SARS-CoV-2 viruses within an ultra-short time, while retaining the mask
performance. Silver thin film is coated on commercial polyimide film by
physical vapor deposition and patterned by laser scribing to form a Joule
heating electrode. Another layer of the gold thin film was coated onto the
opposite side of the device to promote the uniformity of the Joule heating
through nano-heat transfer regulation. As a result, the surgical mask can be
heated to inactivation temperature within a short time and with high
uniformity. By Joule-heating the surgical mask with the temperature at 90
{\deg}C for 3 minutes, the inactivation of the SARS-CoV-2 showed an efficacy of
99.89%. Normal commodity surgical masks can be sterilized faster, more
frequently, and efficiently against SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the new invariants.

diverse set of applications ranging from electronic commerce to community
detection in social networks. In many of these applications, the underlying
context is better modelled as a weighted hypergraph that keeps evolving with
time.
  This motivates the problem of maintaining the densest subhypergraph of a
weighted hypergraph in a {\em dynamic setting}, where the input keeps changing
via a sequence of updates (hyperedge insertions/deletions). Previously, the
only known algorithm for this problem was due to Hu et al. [HWC17]. This
algorithm worked only on unweighted hypergraphs, and had an approximation ratio
of $(1+\epsilon)r^2$ and an update time of $O(\text{poly} (r, \log n))$, where
$r$ denotes the maximum rank of the input across all the updates.
  We obtain a new algorithm for this problem, which works even when the input
hypergraph is weighted. Our algorithm has a significantly improved
(near-optimal) approximation ratio of $(1+\epsilon)$ that is independent of
$r$, and a similar update time of $O(\text{poly} (r, \log n))$. It is the first
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm even for the special case of weighted
simple graphs.
  To complement our theoretical analysis, we perform experiments with our
dynamic algorithm on large-scale, real-world data-sets. Our algorithm
significantly outperforms the state of the art [HWC17] both in terms of
accuracy and efficiency.

cosmological signal from the much stronger foreground contributions at radio
frequencies. The BINGO radio telescope is designed to measure the 21 cm line
and detect BAOs using the intensity mapping technique. This work analyses the
performance of the GNILC method, combined with a power spectrum debiasing
procedure. The method was applied to a simulated BINGO mission, building upon
previous work from the collaboration. It compares two different synchrotron
emission models and different instrumental configurations, in addition to the
combination with ancillary data to optimize both the foreground removal and
recovery of the 21 cm signal across the full BINGO frequency band, as well as
to determine an optimal number of frequency bands for the signal recovery. We
have produced foreground emissions maps using the Planck Sky Model, the
cosmological Hi emission maps are generated using the FLASK package and thermal
noise maps are created according to the instrumental setup. We apply the GNILC
method to the simulated sky maps to separate the Hi plus thermal noise
contribution and, through a debiasing procedure, recover an estimate of the
noiseless 21 cm power spectrum. We found a near optimal reconstruction of the
Hi signal using a 80 bins configuration, which resulted in a power spectrum
reconstruction average error over all frequencies of 3%. Furthermore, our tests
showed that GNILC is robust against different synchrotron emission models.
Finally, adding an extra channel with CBASS foregrounds information, we reduced
the estimation error of the 21 cm signal. The optimisation of our previous
work, producing a configuration with an optimal number of channels for binning
the data, impacts greatly the decisions regarding BINGO hardware configuration
before commissioning.

splitting the AI model into a device-side model and a server-side model at a

across devices, which incurs significant training latency especially when the
number of devices is large. In this paper, we design a novel SL scheme to
reduce the training latency, named Cluster-based Parallel SL (CPSL) which
conducts model training in a ""first-parallel-then-sequential"" manner.
Specifically, the CPSL is to partition devices into several clusters,
parallelly train device-side models in each cluster and aggregate them, and
then sequentially train the whole AI model across clusters, thereby
parallelizing the training process and reducing training latency. Furthermore,
we propose a resource management algorithm to minimize the training latency of
CPSL considering device heterogeneity and network dynamics in wireless

selection, real-time device clustering, and radio spectrum allocation. The
proposed two-timescale algorithm can jointly make the cut layer selection
decision in a large timescale and device clustering and radio spectrum
allocation decisions in a small timescale. Extensive simulation results on

radio bursts. Although several hundreds FRBs have been discovered, their
physical nature and central engine remain unclear. The variations of Faraday
rotation measure and dispersion measure, due to local environment, are crucial
clues to understanding their physical nature. The recent observations on the
rotation measure of FRB 20201124A show a significant variation on a day time
scale. Intriguingly, the oscillation of rotation measure supports that the
local contribution can change sign, which indicates the magnetic field reversal
along the line of sight. Here we present a physical model that explains
observed characteristics of FRB 20201124A and proposes that repeating signal
comes from a binary system containing a magnetar and a Be star with a decretion
disk. When the magnetar approaches the periastron, the propagation of radio
waves through the disk of the Be star naturally leads to the observed varying
rotation measure, depolarization, large scattering timescale, and Faraday
conversion. This study will prompt to search for FRB signals from Be/X-ray
binaries.

  by Penalizing KL Divergence",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a distributed learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) faces the
communication bottleneck issue due to many rounds of model synchronization and
aggregation. Heterogeneous data further deteriorates the situation by causing
slow convergence. Although the impact of data heterogeneity on supervised FL
has been widely studied, the related investigation for Federated Reinforcement
Learning (FRL) is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first define the type
and level of data heterogeneity for policy gradient based FRL systems. By
inspecting the connection between the global and local objective functions, we
prove that local training can benefit the global objective, if the local update
is properly penalized by the total variation (TV) distance between the local
and global policies. A necessary condition for the global policy to be
learn-able from the local policy is also derived, which is directly related to
the heterogeneity level. Based on the theoretical result, a Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence based penalty is proposed, which, different from the
conventional method that penalizes the model divergence in the parameter space,
directly constrains the model outputs in the distribution space. Convergence
proof of the proposed algorithm is also provided. By jointly penalizing the
divergence of the local policy from the global policy with a global penalty and
constraining each iteration of the local training with a local penalty, the
proposed method achieves a better trade-off between training speed (step size)
and convergence. Experiment results on two popular Reinforcement Learning (RL)
experiment platforms demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm over
existing methods in accelerating and stabilizing the training process with
heterogeneous data.

single-phase equivalent model. However, these assumptions do not apply to
low-voltage distribution networks, so the network model should model the
effects of phase unbalance correctly. In many parts of the world, the
low-voltage distribution network has four conductors, i.e. three phases and a
neutral. This paper develops OPF formulations for such networks, including
transformers, shunts and voltage-dependent loads, in two variable spaces, i.e.
current-voltage and power-voltage, and compares them for robustness and

uniform mean gradient. The Taylor-scale Reynolds number $R_\lambda$ goes up to
$1300$, and the Schmidt number $Sc$ up to $512$ (albeit at smaller

$\mu_\theta \approx 0.35$ for $Sc=1$. These findings are in essential agreement
with previously reported results in the literature. We further show that
$\mu_\theta$ decreases monotonically with increasing $Sc$, either as $1/\log

generalized to include the photon-electron gravitational interaction, which
leads to the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). Although GUP considers
gravitational uncertainty at the minimum fundamental length scale in physics,
it does not consider the effects of spacetime curvature on quantum mechanical
uncertainty relations. The Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) is a
generalization of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle that, unlike the GUP,
applies to large length scales. GEUP is also a linear combination of EUP and
GUP that creates minimal uncertainty on large length scales. The
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory (EGB) can be considered as one of the most
promising candidates for modified gravity. In this paper, by using GUP, EUP,
and GEUP, we intend to obtain the Hawking temperature of a four-dimensional EGB
black hole in the asymptotically flat and (Anti)-de Sitter spacetime. We show
that coupling constant, cosmological constant, mass, and radius significantly
affect Hawking temperature and decrease or increase Hawking temperature
depending on the chosen horizons.

and recovering multiple hands from a single 2D image. Previous studies either
focus on single hand reconstruction or solve this problem in a multi-stage way.
Moreover, the conventional two-stage pipeline firstly detects hand areas, and
then estimates 3D hand pose from each cropped patch. To reduce the
computational redundancy in preprocessing and feature extraction, for the first
time, we propose a concise but efficient single-stage pipeline for multi-hand
reconstruction. Specifically, we design a multi-head auto-encoder structure,
where each head network shares the same feature map and outputs the hand
center, pose and texture, respectively. Besides, we adopt a weakly-supervised
scheme to alleviate the burden of expensive 3D real-world data annotations. To
this end, we propose a series of losses optimized by a stage-wise training
scheme, where a multi-hand dataset with 2D annotations is generated based on
the publicly available single hand datasets. In order to further improve the
accuracy of the weakly supervised model, we adopt several feature consistency
constraints in both single and multiple hand settings. Specifically, the
keypoints of each hand estimated from local features should be consistent with
the re-projected points predicted from global features. Extensive experiments

the impact of inhomogeneous hit counts as well as of the mean-field bias due to
incomplete sky coverage. In the first stage, our results show that the 150 GHz

optimization algorithms cannot afford such a long series. The question is

procedure is usually operated by a joystick in static environments, while
indoor environments often are dynamic with moving objects such as people. The
generated map with noisy points due to the dynamic objects is usually
incomplete and distorted. To address this problem, we propose a framework of
2D-LiDAR-based SLAM without manual control that effectively excludes dynamic
objects (people) and simplify the process for a robot to map an environment.
The framework, which includes three parts: people tracking, filtering and

over the traditional modular approaches. To further improve the performance of
the end-to-end speaker diarization for real speech recordings, recently works
have been proposed which integrate unsupervised clustering algorithms with the
end-to-end neural diarization models. However, these methods have a number of
drawbacks: 1) The unsupervised clustering algorithms cannot leverage the
supervision from the available datasets; 2) The K-means-based unsupervised
algorithms that are explored often suffer from the constraint violation
problem; 3) There is unavoidable mismatch between the supervised training and
the unsupervised inference. In this paper, a robust generic neural clustering
approach is proposed that can be integrated with any chunk-level predictor to
accomplish a fully supervised end-to-end speaker diarization model. Also, by
leveraging the sequence modelling ability of a recurrent neural network, the
proposed neural clustering approach can dynamically estimate the number of
speakers during inference. Experimental show that when integrating an
attractor-based chunk-level predictor, the proposed neural clustering approach
can yield better Diarization Error Rate (DER) than the constrained
K-means-based clustering approaches under the mismatched conditions.

thermal conductivity. However, how the anharmonicity influences the thermal
conduction in amorphous materials is still an open question. In this work, we
uncover the role of anharmonicity on the thermal conductivity of amorphous
silica (a-SiO2) by comparing the thermal conductivity predicted from the
harmonic theory and the anharmonic theory. Moreover, we explore the effect of
anharmonicity-induced frequency shift on the prediction of the thermal
conductivity. It is found that the thermal conductivity calculated by the
recently developed anharmonic theory (quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo approximation,
QHGK) is higher than that by the harmonic theory developed by Allen and
Feldman. The use of anharmonic vibrational frequencies also leads to a higher
thermal conductivity compared with that calculated using harmonic vibrational
frequencies. The anharmonicity induced frequency shifts is a mechanism for the
positive temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 at higher
temperatures. Further investigation on mode diffusivity suggests that although
anharmonicity has larger influence on locons than diffusons, the increase of
the thermal conductivity due to the anharmonicity is mainly contributed by the
anharmonicity induced increase of the diffusivity of diffusons. Finally, it is
found that the cross-correlations between diffusons and diffusons contribute
most to the thermal conductivity of a-SiO2, and the locons contribute to the
thermal conductivity mainly through collaboration with diffusons. These results
offer new insights into the nature of the thermal conduction in a-SiO2.

we introduce TABi, a method to jointly train bi-encoders on knowledge graph

leverages a type-enforced contrastive loss to encourage entities and queries of

strong overall retrieval performance on open-domain tasks in the KILT benchmark

scale constrained by the CMB anisotropies. The spectral shape is different from
either temperature perturbations or any other traditional spectral distortions
from Compton scattering, such as $y$ and $\mu$. The new spectral distortion is
not formed in the late Universe, unlike the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
degenerated with the primordial $y$ distortions since photons must be hot for
Rayleigh scattering. Therefore, ideal measurements can distinguish the signal
from the other effects and extract new information during recombination.
Assuming cosmological parameters consistent with the recent CMB anisotropy

techniques are combined to improve the network performance. Random linear
network coding (RLNC) is another popular technique to enhance the efficiency

the potential of RLNC in full-duplex relay networks, we investigate two
fundamental perfect RLNC schemes and theoretically analyze their completion
delay performance. The first scheme is a straightforward application of
conventional perfect RLNC studied in wireless broadcast, so it involves no
additional process at the relay. Its performance serves as an upper bound for
all perfect RLNC schemes. The other scheme allows sufficiently large buffer and
unconstrained linear coding at the relay. It attains the optimal performance
and serves as a lower bound for all RLNC schemes. For both schemes, closed-form
formulae to characterize the expected completion delay at a single receiver as
well as for the whole system are derived. Numerical results are also
demonstrated to validate the theoretical characterizations, and compare the two
fundamental schemes with the existing one.

point clouds upsampling as the task of seeking nearest projection points on the

(UDA) focus on adapting from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target
domain directly in a one-off way. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA), on the other
hand, assumes a path of $(T-1)$ unlabeled intermediate domains bridging the
source and target, and aims to provide better generalization in the target
domain by leveraging the intermediate ones. Under certain assumptions, Kumar et
al. (2020) proposed a simple algorithm, Gradual Self-Training, along with a
generalization bound in the order of $e^{O(T)}
\left(\varepsilon_0+O\left(\sqrt{log(T)/n}\right)\right)$ for the target domain
error, where $\varepsilon_0$ is the source domain error and $n$ is the data
size of each domain. Due to the exponential factor, this upper bound becomes
vacuous when $T$ is only moderately large. In this work, we analyze gradual
self-training under more general and relaxed assumptions, and prove a
significantly improved generalization bound as $\varepsilon_0+ O \left(T\Delta
+ T/\sqrt{n}\right) + \widetilde{O}\left(1/\sqrt{nT}\right)$, where $\Delta$ is
the average distributional distance between consecutive domains. Compared with
the existing bound with an exponential dependency on $T$ as a multiplicative
factor, our bound only depends on $T$ linearly and additively. Perhaps more
interestingly, our result implies the existence of an optimal choice of $T$
that minimizes the generalization error, and it also naturally suggests an
optimal way to construct the path of intermediate domains so as to minimize the
accumulative path length $T\Delta$ between the source and target. To
corroborate the implications of our theory, we examine gradual self-training on
multiple semi-synthetic and real datasets, which confirms our findings. We
believe our insights provide a path forward toward the design of future GDA
algorithms.

  constraints","35 pages, initial version July 2021",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper we consider optimization problems with stochastic composite
objective function subject to (possibly) infinite intersection of constraints.
The objective function is expressed in terms of expectation operator over a sum
of two terms satisfying a stochastic bounded gradient condition, with or
without strong convexity type properties. In contrast to the classical
approach, where the constraints are usually represented as intersection of
simple sets, in this paper we consider that each constraint set is given as the
level set of a convex but not necessarily differentiable function. Based on the
flexibility offered by our general optimization model we consider a stochastic
subgradient method with random feasibility updates. At each iteration, our
algorithm takes a stochastic proximal (sub)gradient step aimed at minimizing
the objective function and then a subsequent subgradient step minimizing the
feasibility violation of the observed random constraint. We analyze the
convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm for diminishing stepsizes and
for the case when the objective function is convex or has a quadratic
functional growth, unifying the nonsmooth and smooth cases. We prove sublinear
convergence rates for this stochastic subgradient algorithm, which are known to
be optimal for subgradient methods on this class of problems. When the
objective function has a linear least-square form and the constraints are
polyhedral, it is shown that the algorithm converges linearly. Numerical
evidence supports the effectiveness of our method in real problems.

TeV flux can reach $\sim 10^{-9} -10^{-10}\rm erg ~ cm^{-2} ~ s^{-1}$ at $t

the shock parameters in the modeling are similar with two other Sub-TeV GRBs
(i.e., GRB 190114C and GRB 180720B), implying that the Sub-TeV GRBs have some
commonalities: they have energetic burst energy, low circum-burst medium

gradient quantization through floating-point conversion, (ii) lossless
compression of the quantized gradient, and (iii) quantization error correction.
We carefully design each of the steps above to assure good training performance
under a constraint on the communication rate. In particular, in steps (i) and
(ii), we adopt the assumption that DNN gradients are distributed according to a
generalized normal distribution, which is validated numerically in the paper.
For step (iii), we utilize an error feedback with memory decay mechanism to
correct the quantization error introduced in step (i). We argue that the memory
decay coefficient, similarly to the learning rate, can be optimally tuned to
improve convergence. A rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed CO3 with

improved performance when compared with existing gradient compression schemes

because of their large spin-orbit interaction which enables ultrafast
all-electric qubit control at low power. The fastest spin qubits to date are
defined in long quantum dots with two tight confinement directions, when the
driving field is aligned to the smooth direction. However, in these systems the
lifetime of the qubit is strongly limited by charge noise, a major issue in
hole qubits. We propose here a different, scalable qubit design, compatible
with planar CMOS technology, where the hole is confined in a curved germanium
quantum well surrounded by silicon. This design takes full advantage of the
strong spin-orbit interaction of holes, and at the same time suppresses charge
noise in a wide range of configurations, enabling highly coherent, ultrafast
qubit gates. While here we focus on a Si/Ge/Si curved quantum well, our design
is also applicable to different semiconductors. Strikingly, these devices allow
for ultrafast operations even in short quantum dots by a transversal electric
field. This additional driving mechanism relaxes the demanding design
constraints, and opens up a new way to reliably interface spin qubits in a
single quantum dot to microwave photons. By considering state-of-the-art
high-impedance resonators and realistic qubit designs, we estimate interaction
strengths of a few hundreds of MHz, largely exceeding the decay rate of spins
and photons. Reaching such a strong coupling regime in hole spin qubits will be
a significant step towards high-fidelity entangling operations between distant

implementation of a large-scale semiconducting quantum processor.

systems and achieved by various means such as using large antenna arrays and/or

improve spectral efficiency through combining non-orthogonal spectrally
efficient frequency division multiplexing (SEFDM) systems with index modulation
(IM), which can efficiently make use of the indices of activated subcarriers as
communication information. Recent research has verified that IM may be used
with SEFDM to alleviate inter-carrier interference (ICI) and improve error
performance. This work proposes new SEFDM signal formats based on novel
activation pattern designs, which limit the locations of activated subcarriers
and enable a variable number of activated subcarriers in each SEFDM subblock.
SEFDM-IM system designs are developed by jointly considering activation
patterns, modulation schemes and signal waveform formats, with a set of
solutions evaluated under different spectral efficiency scenarios. Detailed
modelling of coded systems and simulation studies reveal that the proposed
designs not only lead to better bit error rate (BER) but also lower
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and reduced computational complexity

have also been extended to the quantum realm. Here, we develop a Lee-Yang
theory of quantum phase transitions that can include thermal fluctuations
caused by a finite temperature, and it thereby provides a link between the
classical Lee-Yang formalism and recent theories of phase transitions at zero
temperature. Our methodology exploits analytic properties of the moment
generating function of the order parameter in systems of finite size, and it
can be implemented in combination with tensor-network calculations.
Specifically, the onset of a symmetry-broken phase is signaled by the zeros of
the moment generating function approaching the origin in the complex plane of a
counting field that couples to the order parameter. Moreover, the zeros can be
obtained by measuring or calculating the high cumulants of the order parameter.
We determine the phase diagram of the two-dimensional quantum Ising model and
thereby demonstrate the potential of our method to predict the critical
behavior of two-dimensional quantum systems at finite temperatures.

the study of disk clearing mechanisms. Such disks have been identified through
a deficit in the infrared part of their SED, but spatially resolved millimeter
imaging is required to confirm the presence of an inner dust cavity. We use
high-resolution ALMA observations of 30 mas resolution in Band 6 continuum and
$^{12}$CO 2--1 emission of 10 transition disk candidates in the Lupus star
forming region, in order to confirm the presence of inner dust cavities and
infer the responsible mechanism. The continuum data are analyzed using
visibility modeling and the SEDs are compared with radiative transfer models.
Out of the six transition disk candidates selected from their SED, only one
disk revealed an inner dust cavity of 4 au in radius. Three of the other disks
are highly inclined, which limits the detectability of an inner dust cavity but
it is also demonstrated to be the possible cause for the infrared deficit in
their SED. The two remaining SED-selected disks are very compact, with dust
radii of only $\sim$3 au. From the four candidates selected from low-resolution
images, three new transition disks with large inner cavities $>$20 au are
identified, bringing the total number of transition disks with large cavities
in Lupus to 13. SED-selected transition disks with small cavities are biased
towards highly inclined and compact disks, which casts doubt on the use of
their occurrence rates in estimating dispersal timescales of photoevaporation.
Using newly derived disk dust masses and radii, we re-evaluate the
size-luminosity and $M_{\rm dust}-M_{\rm star}$ relations. These relations can
be understood if the bright disks are dominated by disks with substructure
whereas faint disks are dominated by drift-dominated disks. (Abridged)

strategy, which may suffer from ""over-smoothing"" problem, while others directly
infuse semantics into targets in off-line way requiring extra data. Different
from them, we shift the perspective to the Fourier domain which naturally has
global perspective and present a new Masked Image Modeling (MIM), termed
Geminated Gestalt Autoencoder (Ge$^2$-AE) for visual pre-training.
Specifically, we equip our model with geminated decoders in charge of
reconstructing image contents from both pixel and frequency space, where each
other serves as not only the complementation but also the reciprocal
constraints. Through this way, more robust representations can be learned in
the pre-trained encoders, of which the effectiveness is confirmed by the
juxtaposing experimental results on downstream recognition tasks. We also
conduct several quantitative and qualitative experiments to investigate the

work to solve the visual pre-training through the lens of frequency domain.

preference shift modeling, and social influence activation. Our end-to-end

become increasingly popular. The prosperity of the library usage has provided
the software engineers with handful of methods to facilitate and boost the

becomes much more difficult to manage the large volume of libraries. Researches
and studies have been proposed to detect and understand the TPLs in the
software. However, most existing approaches rely on syntactic features, which
are not robust when these features are changed or deliberately hidden by the
adversarial parties. Moreover, these approaches typically model each of the
imported libraries as a whole, therefore, cannot be applied to scenarios where
the host software only partially uses the library code segments.

distance between modules to detect similar library module reuse in the program.
Experimental results show that ModX outperforms other modularization tools by

of high-order virtual processes with different transition paths well described

transitions of the pair creation. By tuning the frequency of the atom, we show
that photon frequency conversion can be realized within a cavity of multiple

mode, a single vibrating excitation of the mechanical oscillator can be
simultaneously absorbed by the two atoms. Considering recent advances in strong

efficient, such a structure loses interaction between the query-passage pair,
resulting in inferior accuracy. To enhance the performance of dense retrieval
models without loss of efficiency, we propose a GNN-encoder model in which

graph neural networks that are constructed by queries and their top retrieved
passages. By this means, we maintain a dual-encoder structure, and retain some

Cross-space locality preservation is incorporated to bridge the cluster

presented to enable the simultaneous learning of the cluster structure, the

Approximations are introduced via a proper choice of the many-particle
self-energy or decoupling of the BBGKY hierarchy. These approximations are
based on Feynman's diagram approaches or on cluster expansions into
single-particle and correlation operators. Here, we develop a different
approach where, instead of equations of motion for the many-particle NEGF (or

of the alternative hierarchy of fluctuations and discuss possible decoupling
approximations. In particular, we derive the polarization approximation (PA)
which is shown to be equivalent to the single-time version [following by
applying the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA)] of the nonequilibrium
$GW$ approximation with exchange effects of NEGF theory, for weak coupling. The
main advantage of the quantum fluctuations approach is that the standard

  Our low-diameter decomposition generalizes and extends the line of work
starting from [Rozho\v{n}, Ghaffari STOC 2020] to weighted graphs in a very
model-independent manner. Moreover, our clustering results have additional
useful properties, including strong-diameter guarantees, separation properties,
restricting cluster centers to specified terminals, and more. Applications
include:
  -- The first near-linear work and polylogarithmic depth randomized and
deterministic parallel algorithm for low-stretch spanning trees (LSST) with
polylogarithmic stretch. Previously, the best parallel LSST algorithm required
$m \cdot n^{o(1)}$ work and $n^{o(1)}$ depth and was inherently randomized. No
deterministic LSST algorithm with truly sub-quadratic work and sub-linear depth
was known.
  -- The first near-linear work and polylogarithmic depth deterministic
algorithm for computing an $\ell_1$-embedding into polylogarithmic dimensional
space with polylogarithmic distortion. The best prior deterministic algorithms
for $\ell_1$-embeddings either require large polynomial work or are inherently
sequential.
  Even when we apply our techniques to the classical problem of computing a
ball-carving with strong-diameter $O(\log^2 n)$ in an unweighted graph, our new

$O(\log^{10} n)$ rounds [Chang, Ghaffari PODC 21] to $O(\log^{4} n)$.

encoding for single mode stimuli: visual (pretrained CNNs) or text (pretrained

representation models and performed late-fusion using simple heuristics.
However, previous work has failed to explore: (a) the effectiveness of image
Transformer models for encoding visual stimuli, and (b) co-attentive
multi-modal modeling for visual and text reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically explore the efficacy of image Transformers (ViT, DEiT, and BEiT)
and multi-modal Transformers (VisualBERT, LXMERT, and CLIP) for brain encoding.
Extensive experiments on two popular datasets, BOLD5000 and Pereira, provide

other previously proposed multi-modal models, thereby establishing new

of whether the responses elicited in the visual regions are affected implicitly
by linguistic processing even when passively viewing images. Future fMRI tasks

This approach greatly reduces the length of text for a system to analyze. Next,
RFEC detects the entity-level errors in the summaries by considering the

the understanding and the control of light with photonic nanostructures, as
well as for nanoparticle scattering itself, including Mie scattering. Here, we
theoretically and numerically investigate the possibility to manipulate
nanoparticle scattering by wavefront shaping that was initially developed to
control light scattered by large numbers of nanoparticles in nanophotonic
media. By employing a scattering matrix analysis, we find that even a single
nanoparticle supports multiple strongly scattering eigenchannels, suggesting
wavefront shaping as a promising tool to manipulate scattered light of a single
nanoparticle. By sending in shaped wavefronts, we selectively excite
eigenchannels, as is apparent from the distinct field distributions. These
scattering eigenchannels are related to different resonant leaky modes of the
scatterer, that reveal remarkable localized ""hot spots"" where the field is
substantially enhanced. Moreover, we investigate the backscattered spectra; to
this send in wavefronts relevant for a particular eigenchannel, and observe
that the backscattered spectrum reveals not only the excited channel but also
several others. This result points to the existence of short and long-range
spectral correlations for an eigenchannel. Our work offers a flexible tool to
manipulate light scattering of a single nanoparticle, and thus opens new
possibilities to control field patterns and light-matter interactions in a
nanoparticle, as well as to explore new features of nanoparticle scattering
such as the spectral correlation and temporal response of light scattered by
nano scatterers, including Mie spheres.

synthesized from amphiphilic molecules simpler than phospholipids such as fatty
alcohols. The discovery in the interstellar medium (ISM) of ethanolamine, the

amphiphilic molecules are also synthesized in space. We investigate whether
precursors of fatty alcohols are present in the ISM. For this, we have carried
out a spectral survey at 7, 3, 2 and 1 mm toward the Giant Molecular Cloud
G+0.693-0.027 located in the Galactic Center using the IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m
telescopes. Here, we report the detection in the ISM of the primary alcohol
n-propanol (in both conformers Ga-n-C3H7OH and Aa-n-C3H7OH), a precursor of
fatty alcohols. The derived column densities of n-propanol are (5.5+-0.4)x10^13
cm^-2 for the Ga conformer and (3.4+-0.3)x10^13 cm^-2 for the Aa conformer,
which imply molecular abundances of (4.1+-0.3)x10^-10 for Ga-n-C3H7OH and of
(2.5+-0.2)x10^-10 for Aa-n-C3H7OH. We also searched for the AGa conformer of
n-butanol (AGa-n-C4H9OH) without success yielding an upper limit to its
abundance of <4.1x10^-11. The inferred CH3OH:C2H5OH:C3H7OH:C4H9OH abundance
ratios go as 1:0.04:0.006:<0.0004 toward G+0.693-0.027, i.e. they decrease
roughly by one order of magnitude for increasing complexity. We also report the
detection of both syn and anti conformers of vinyl alcohol, with column
densities of (1.11+-0.08)x10^14 cm^-2 and (1.3+-0.4)x10^13 cm^-2, and
abundances of (8.2+-0.6)x10^-10 and (9.6+-3.0)x10^-11, respectively. The
detection of n-propanol, together with the recent discovery of ethanolamine in

deployed to improve localised regions in a herbage field, effectively reducing

In this context, deep learning algorithms offer a tempting alternative to the

system with subsequent use of nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) to
compute conservative, non-conservative, and stochastic forces exerted by
electrons on nuclear degrees of freedom. We analyze the effectiveness of this
approximation, paying particular attention to the phenomenon of negative
viscosities. The perturbative approximation is directly compared to the
nonequilibrium Ehrenfest approach. We introduce a novel time-stepping approach
to calculate the forces present in the Ehrenfest method via exact integration
of the equations of motion for the nonequilibrium Green's functions, which does
not necessitate a time-scale separation within the system and provides an exact
description for the corresponding classical dynamics. We observe that negative
viscosities are not artifacts of a perturbative treatment but also emerge in
Ehrenfest dynamics. However, the effects of negative viscosity have the
possibility of being overwhelmed by the predominantly positive dissipation due
to the higher-order forces unaccounted for by the perturbative approach.
Additionally, we assess the validity of the white-noise approximation for the
stochastic forces, finding that it is justifiable in the presence of a clear
time-scale separation and is more applicable when the current-carrying
molecular orbital is moved outside of the voltage window. Finally, we
demonstrate the method for molecular junction models consisting of one and two

determine the conditions of existence for such GR-VCDM solutions in terms of
the trace of the extrinsic curvature and on the fields which define the VCDM
theory. On the other hand, for the Cuscuton theory, we find that the same set
of exact GR solutions (such as Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes) is not
compatible with timelike configurations of the Cuscuton field and therefore
cannot be considered as acceptable solutions. Nonetheless, in Cuscuton theory,
there could exist solutions which are not the same but close enough to GR
solutions. We also show the conditions to determine intrinsic-VCDM solutions,
i.e. solutions which differ from GR and do not belong to the Cuscuton model. We
finally show that in cosmology a mapping between VCDM and the Cuscuton is
possible, for a generic form of the VCDM potential. In particular, we find that

q}^{-2}(\R^d)$ to $\mathbb{P} \dot{B}_{d, q}^{0}(\R^d)$ by showing that a
sequence of external forces is constructed to show discontinuity of the
solution map at zero. Indeed in such case of $q$, there exists a sequence of
external forces which converges to zero in $\dot{B}_{d, q}^{-2}$ and yields a
sequence of solutions which does not converge to zero in $\dot{B}_{d, q}^{0}$.
In particular, we also prove that the stationary Navier-Stokes equations is
well-posed from $\dot{B}_{d, 2}^{-2}(\R^d)$ to $\mathbb{P} \dot{B}_{d,
2}^{0}(\R^d)$ with $d=3,4$. Based on these two cases, we demonstrate that the
above open question for the dimension $d\geq4$ has been solved completely.

strategy-proof when agents face uncertainty about other agents' preference

gradient~(NAG), are widely used in training neural networks for their fast
convergence. However, there is a lack of theoretical guarantees for their
convergence and acceleration since the optimization landscape of the neural
network is non-convex. Nowadays, some works make progress towards understanding
the convergence of momentum methods in an over-parameterized regime, where the
number of the parameters exceeds that of the training instances. Nonetheless,
current results mainly focus on the two-layer neural network, which are far
from explaining the remarkable success of the momentum methods in training deep
neural networks. Motivated by this, we investigate the convergence of NAG with
constant learning rate and momentum parameter in training two architectures of
deep linear networks: deep fully-connected linear neural networks and deep
linear ResNets. Based on the over-parameterization regime, we first analyze the
residual dynamics induced by the training trajectory of NAG for a deep
fully-connected linear neural network under the random Gaussian initialization.
Our results show that NAG can converge to the global minimum at a $(1 -
\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\kappa}))^t$ rate, where $t$ is the iteration number and
$\kappa > 1$ is a constant depending on the condition number of the feature
matrix. Compared to the $(1 - \mathcal{O}(1/{\kappa}))^t$ rate of GD, NAG
achieves an acceleration over GD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first theoretical guarantee for the convergence of NAG to the global minimum in
training deep neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to deep
linear ResNets and derive a similar convergence result.

image degradation that integrates resolution conversion and synthetic rain
models is required. For example, in heavy rain, face images captured by CCTV
from a distance have significant deterioration in both visibility and
resolution. Unlike traditional image degradation models (IDM), such as rain
removal and superresolution, this study addresses a new IDM referred to as a
scale-aware heavy rain model and proposes a method for restoring
high-resolution face images (HR-FIs) from low-resolution heavy rain face images
(LRHR-FI). To this end, a 2-stage network is presented. The first stage
generates low-resolution face images (LR-FIs), from which heavy rain has been
removed from the LRHR-FIs to improve visibility. To realize this, an
interpretable IDM-based network is constructed to predict physical parameters,
such as rain streaks, transmission maps, and atmospheric light. In addition,
the image reconstruction loss is evaluated to enhance the estimates of the
physical parameters. For the second stage, which aims to reconstruct the HR-FIs
from the LR-FIs outputted in the first stage, facial component guided
adversarial learning (FCGAL) is applied to boost facial structure expressions.
To focus on informative facial features and reinforce the authenticity of
facial components, such as the eyes and nose, a face-parsing-guided generator
and facial local discriminators are designed for FCGAL. The experimental
results verify that the proposed approach based on physical-based network
design and FCGAL can remove heavy rain and increase the resolution and
visibility simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed heavy-rain face image
restoration outperforms state-of-the-art models of heavy rain removal,
image-to-image translation, and superresolution.

is important to understand the interaction between two scenarios, and
harmoniously display AR contents. However, studies on how this superimposition
will influence the human visual attention are lacking. Therefore, in this
paper, we mainly analyze the interaction effect between background (BG) scenes
and AR contents, and study the saliency prediction problem in AR. Specifically,
we first construct a Saliency in AR Dataset (SARD), which contains 450 BG

classification and diagnosis of breast cancer and its histopathological images
have always been a hot spot of clinical concern. In Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD), traditional classification models mostly use a single network to extract
features, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, many networks
are trained and optimized on patient-level datasets, ignoring the application
of lower-level data labels.
  Method: This paper proposes a deep ensemble model based on image-level labels
for the binary classification of benign and malignant lesions of breast
histopathological images. First, the BreaKHis dataset is randomly divided into
a training, validation and test set. Then, data augmentation techniques are
used to balance the number of benign and malignant samples. Thirdly,
considering the performance of transfer learning and the complementarity
between each network, VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet201 are selected as
the base classifiers.
  Result: In the ensemble network model with accuracy as the weight, the
image-level binary classification achieves an accuracy of $98.90\%$. In order
to verify the capabilities of our method, the latest Transformer and Multilayer
Perception (MLP) models have been experimentally compared on the same dataset.
Our model wins with a $5\%-20\%$ advantage, emphasizing the ensemble model's
far-reaching significance in classification tasks.
  Conclusion: This research focuses on improving the model's classification
performance with an ensemble algorithm. Transfer learning plays an essential
role in small datasets, improving training speed and accuracy. Our model has
outperformed many existing approaches in accuracy, providing a method for the
field of auxiliary medical diagnosis.

$n$-bit string $x$ is sampled with probability $\delta$ by an algorithm with
prefix-free domain then K$(x) \leq \log(1/\delta) + O(1)$. In a recent work, Lu
and Oliveira [LO21] established an unconditional time-bounded version of this
result, by showing that if $x$ can be efficiently sampled with probability
$\delta$ then rKt$(x) = O(\log(1/\delta)) + O(\log n)$, where rKt denotes the
randomized analogue of Levin's Kt complexity. Unfortunately, this result is
often insufficient when transferring applications of the classical coding
theorem to the time-bounded setting, as it achieves a $O(\log(1/\delta))$ bound
instead of the information-theoretic optimal $\log(1/\delta)$.
  We show a coding theorem for rKt with a factor of $2$. As in previous work,
our coding theorem is efficient in the sense that it provides a polynomial-time
probabilistic algorithm that, when given $x$, the code of the sampler, and
$\delta$, it outputs, with probability $\ge 0.99$, a probabilistic
representation of $x$ that certifies this rKt complexity bound.
  Assuming the security of cryptographic pseudorandom generators, we show that
no efficient coding theorem can achieve a bound of the form rKt$(x) \leq (2 -
o(1)) \cdot \log(1/\delta) +$ poly$(\log n)$. Under a weaker assumption, we
exhibit a gap between efficient coding theorems and existential coding theorems
with near-optimal parameters.
  We consider pK$^t$ complexity [GKLO22], a variant of rKt where the randomness
is public and the time bound is fixed. We observe the existence of an optimal
coding theorem for pK$^t$, and employ this result to establish an unconditional
version of a theorem of Antunes and Fortnow [AF09] which characterizes the
worst-case running times of languages that are in average polynomial-time over

it is challenging to measure the isotope (isotopologue) ratios, especially in
protoplanetary disks, because the emission lines of major species are
saturated. We developed a new method to overcome these challenges by using
optically thin line wings induced by thermal broadening. As a first application
of the method, we analyzed two carbon monoxide isotopologue lines, $^{12}$CO
$3-2$ and $^{13}$CO $3-2$, from archival observations of a protoplanetary disk
around TW Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array. The
$^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio was estimated to be ${ 20\pm5}$ at disk radii of ${
70-110}$ au, which is significantly smaller than the value observed in the
local interstellar medium, $\sim69$. It implies that an isotope exchange
reaction occurs in a low-temperature environment with $\rm C/O>1$ . In
contrast, it is suggested that $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO is higher than $\sim{ 84}$
in the outer disk ($r > { 130}$ au), which can be explained by the difference
in the binding energy of the isotopologues on dust grains and the CO gas
depletion processes. Our results imply that the gas-phase $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO
can vary by a factor of ${ > 4}$ even inside a protoplanetary disk, and
therefore, can be used to trace material evolution in disks.

Noise Masking, a fill-in-the-blank style method for extracting targeted parts

Masking by using it in four settings for extracting names from the LibriSpeech

show that we are able to extract the correct names from masked training
utterances with 11.8% accuracy, while the model outputs some name from the
train set 55.2% of the time. Further, we show that even in a setting that uses
synthetic audio and partial transcripts from the test set, our method achieves
2.5% correct name accuracy (47.7% any name success rate). Lastly, we design
Word Dropout, a data augmentation method that we show when used in training

analyzed in 1998 a non-symmetric 2-queue Markovian system, where newly arriving

chemistry. One of the major reaction mechanisms is grain-surface diffusion for
which the the binding energy parameter for each species needs to be known.
However, these values vary significantly across the literature which can lead
to debate as to whether or not a particular reaction takes place via diffusion.
In this work we employ Bayesian inference to use available ice abundances to
estimate the reaction rates of the reactions in a chemical network that
produces glycine. Using this we estimate the binding energy of a variety of
important species in the network, by assuming that the reactions take place via
diffusion. We use our understanding of the diffusion mechanism to reduce the
dimensionality of the inference problem from 49 to 14, by demonstrating that
reactions can be separated into classes. This dimensionality reduction makes
the problem computationally feasible. A neural network statistical emulator is
used to also help accelerate the Bayesian inference process substantially.
  The binding energies of most of the diffusive species of interest are found
to match some of the disparate literature values, with the exceptions of atomic
and diatomic hydrogen. The discrepancies with these two species are related to
limitations of the physical and chemical model. However, the use of a dummy
reaction of the form H + X -> HX is found to somewhat reduce the discrepancy
with the binding energy of atomic hydrogen. Using the inferred binding energies
in the full gas-grain version of UCLCHEM results in almost all the molecular
abundances being recovered.

capturing and combining the most informative parts of the whole content.
Existing approaches for video summarization regard the task as a frame-wise

unimodal or bimodal information. However, the optimal video summaries need to
reflect the most valuable keyframe with its own information, and one with
semantic power of the whole content. Thus, it is critical to construct a more
powerful and robust frame-wise representation and predict the frame-level
importance score in a fair and comprehensive manner. To tackle the above
issues, we propose a multimodal hierarchical shot-aware convolutional network,
denoted as MHSCNet, to enhance the frame-wise representation via combining the
comprehensive available multimodal information. Specifically, we design a
hierarchical ShotConv network to incorporate the adaptive shot-aware
frame-level representation by considering the short-range and long-range
temporal dependency. Based on the learned shot-aware representations, MHSCNet
can predict the frame-level importance score in the local and global view of
the video. Extensive experiments on two standard video summarization datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. Source code will be made publicly available.

themselves are random. In this way, our analysis departs from earlier analyses
of cluster randomized experiments in which cluster sizes are treated as
non-random. We distinguish between two different parameters of interest: the
equally-weighted cluster-level average treatment effect, and the size-weighted
cluster-level average treatment effect. For each parameter, we provide methods
for inference in an asymptotic framework where the number of clusters tends to
infinity and treatment is assigned using a covariate-adaptive stratified
randomization procedure. We additionally permit the experimenter to sample only
a subset of the units within each cluster rather than the entire cluster and
demonstrate the implications of such sampling for some commonly used
estimators. A small simulation study and empirical demonstration show the
practical relevance of our theoretical results.

error impairments which are characterized with Gamma-Gamma and Rayleigh fading,
respectively. At the FSO receiver, both the intensity modulated direct

THz link suffers from both high path-loss and misalignment error. The THz
channel is characterized with $\alpha-\mu$ distribution and misalignment error
is characterized with Rayleigh fading. To minimize the effect of back-and-forth
switching, soft switching method is introduced at the access point (AP) to
select the signal coming through the hybrid FSO/THz link, and a comparison with

stronger lower bounds have been longstanding open problems.
  Our main contribution is to show that MIS can be computed in awake complexity
that is \emph{exponentially} better compared to the best known round complexity
of $O(\log n)$ and also bypassing its fundamental

computes an MIS in $O((\log\log{n})\log^*n)$ awake complexity and $O((\log^3 n)

Zecoler casts the downstream tasks to the same form of pre-training tasks by
inserting trainable prompts into the original input. Then, it employs the
prompt learning technique which optimizes the pre-trained model by merely
adjusting the original input. This enables the representation model to
efficiently fit the scarce task-oriented data while reusing pre-trained

This interaction leads to a series of penetrations of the inflatable membrane
on entrance and exit of the impacting particle, creating a pathway for gas
escape. To increase the fidelity of the damage expected, we examine the
literature for descriptions of micrometeoroid fragmentation and present a
theoretical formulation for the damage caused by an impacting particle to the
entrance and exit membranes. This theory is compared to an initial set of
hyper-velocity tests for micrometeoroid-sized particles on thin film membranes.
We use the results of these tests to produce a predictive model. This model is
applied to estimate the damage rate near the 1 AU location and output
predictions for the effectiveness of a micrometeoroid shield to reduce the
damage on the lenticular and effectively optimize its lifetime. Lastly, we
apply the kinetic theory of gasses to develop expressions for the expenditure
of gas over a specified mission lifetime due to penetrations. Although this
paper examines the specific case of an inflated lenticular protected by extra
membrane layers, our predictive model can be applied for any gossamer structure

(SN). Optical light and gravitational waves are also observable, but may be
difficult to observe if the location of the SN in the galaxy or the details of
the explosion are unsuitable. The key to observing the next supernova is to
first use neutrinos to understand various physical quantities and then link
them to other signals. In this paper, we present Monte Carlo sampling
calculations of neutrino events from galactic supernova explosions observed
with Super-Kamiokande. The analytical solution of neutrino emission, which
represents the long-term evolution of neutrino-light curve from supernovae, is
used as a theoretical template. It gives the event rate and event spectrum
through inverse beta decay interactions with explicit model parameter
dependence. Parameter estimation is performed on these simulated sample data by
fitting least squares using the analytical solution. The results show that the
mass, radius and total energy of a remnant neutron star produced by a SN can be
determined with an accuracy of $\sim 0.1M_\odot$, $\sim 1$ km, and $\sim
10^{51}$ erg, respectively, for a galactic SN at 8 kpc.

because they provide rich information about the materials and hold the
possibility of being applied in diodes or high-frequency optical devices.
Nonlinear responses are often closely related to the multiband nature of the
system which can be taken into account by the geometric quantities such as the
Berry curvature as shown in the nonlinear Hall effect. Theoretically, the
semi-classical Boltzmann treatment or the reduced density matrix method have
been often employed, in which the effect of dissipation is included through the
relaxation time approximation. In the diagrammatic method, the relaxation is
treated through the imaginary part of the self-energy of the Green function and
the consequent broadening of the spectral function for the integration over the
real frequency. Therefore, the poles of the Green function do not play explicit
pole when there is finite dissipation. In this paper, in stark contrast to this
conventional picture, we show that the poles of the Green function determine
mostly the nonlinear response functions with dissipation, which leads to the
terms with the Fermi distribution function of complex argument and results in
the dissipation-induced geometric term. We elucidate the geometric origin of
the nonreciprocal conductivity, which is related to the Berry curvature
generalized to the higher derivative. Finally, we derive the analytical results
on the geometric terms of the nonlinear conductivities in the type-I and
type-II Weyl Hamiltonian to demonstrate their crucial roles.

ejected envelopes, $M_{ej} \leq 10^{-1} M_\odot$, much smaller than of a
typical supernova. Short peak times also mean that FBOTs should be
hydrodynamically, not radioactively powered. The detection by Chandra of X-ray
emission in AT2020mrf of $L_X \sim 10^{42} $ erg s$^{-1}$ after 328 days
implies total, overall dominant, X-ray energetics at the Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs) level of $\sim 6 \times 10^{49}$ erg. We further develop a model of
Lyutikov & Toonen (2019), whereby FBOTs are the results of a late accretion
induced collapse (AIC) of the product of super-Chandrasekhar double white dwarf
(WD) merger between ONeMg WD and another WD. Small ejecta mass, and the rarity
of FBOTs, result from the competition between mass loss from the merger product
to the wind, and ashes added to the core, on time scale of $\sim 10^3-10^4$
years. FBOTs occur only when the envelope mass before AIC is $\leq 10^{-1}
M_\odot$. FBOTs proper come from central engine-powered radiation-dominated
forward shock as it propagates through ejecta. FBOTs' duration is determined by
the diffusion time of photons produced by the NS-driven forward shock within
the expanding ejecta. All the photons produced by the central source deep
inside the ejecta escape almost simultaneously, producing a short bright event.
The high energy emission is generated at the highly relativistic and highly
magnetized termination shock, qualitatively similar to Pulsar Wind Nebulae. The
X-ray bump observed in AT2020mrf by SRG/eROSITA, predicted by Lyutikov & Toonen
(2019), is coming from the break-out of the engine-powered shock from the
ejecta into the preceding wind. The model requires total energetics of just few
$\times 10^{50}$ ergs, slightly above the observed X-rays. We predict that the
system is hydrogen poor.

feasible reflection coefficients. We then introduce two variations of the
well-established Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG) agents, aiming for effective exploration of the binary action spaces.
For the case of DQN, we make use of an efficient approximation of the
Q-function, whereas a discretization post-processing step is applied to the
output of DDPG. Our simulation results showcase that the proposed techniques
greatly outperform the baseline in terms of the rate maximization objective,
when large-scale RISs are considered. In addition, when dealing with moderate
scale RIS sizes, where the conventional DQN based on configuration-based action
spaces is feasible, the performance of the latter technique is similar to the
proposed learning approach.

behavioral patterns of PT users are revealed by clustering their boarding

be classified as occasional; (3) The vast majority of users make both recurrent

samples. In this study, we analyze a linear regression model with dependent
time series data under over-parameterization settings. We consider an estimator
via interpolation and developed a theory for the excess risk of the estimator.
Then, we derive bounds of risks by the estimator for the cases where the
temporal correlation of each coordinate of dependent data is homogeneous and
heterogeneous, respectively. The derived bounds reveal that a temporal
covariance of the data plays a key role; its strength affects the bias of the
risk, and its nondegeneracy affects the variance of the risk. Moreover, for the
heterogeneous correlation case, we show that the convergence rate of risks with
short-memory processes is identical to that of cases with independent data, and
the risk can converge to zero even with long-memory processes. Our theory can
be extended to infinite-dimensional data in a unified manner. We also present
several examples of specific dependent processes that can be applied to our

solutions to the ""Navier-Stokes inequality"". These maps essentially satisfy the
incompressibility condition as well as the local and global energy inequalities
and the pressure equation which may be derived formally from the Navier-Stokes
system of equations, but they are not required to satisfy the Navier-Stokes
system itself. One may extend this notion to a system considered by F.-H. Lin
and C. Liu in the mid 1990s related to models of the flow of nematic liquid
crystals, which include the Navier-Stokes system when the 'director field' $d$
is taken to be zero. In addition to an extended Navier-Stokes system, the
Lin-Liu model includes a further parabolic system which implies an a priori
maximum principle for $d$, which is lost when one considers the analogous
'inequality'.
  In 2018, Q. Liu proved a partial regularity result for certain solutions to
the Lin-Liu model in terms of the parabolic fractal dimension
$\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}$, relying on the boundedness of $d$ coming from the
maximum principle. Specifically, Q. Liu proves
$\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}(\Sigma_{-} \cap \mathcal{K}) \leq \tfrac{95}{63}$
for any compact $\mathcal{K}$, where $\Sigma_{-}$ is the set of
'forward-singular' space-time points, near which the solution blows up forwards
in time. For solutions to the corresponding 'inequality', we prove here that,
without any compensation for the lack of maximum principle, one has
$\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}(\Sigma_{-} \cap \mathcal{K}) \leq \tfrac {55}{13}$.
We also provide a range of criteria, including as just one example the
boundedness of $d$, any one of which would furthermore imply that
$\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}(\Sigma_{-} \cap \mathcal{K}) \leq \tfrac{95}{63}$

Lin-Liu system.

determines the separation order in the form of a periodically modulated pattern
as a function of SWCNT diameter. Addition of cosurfactants can be used to
compete with the bile salt surfactant to enhance the separation yields, but

joint text-image embeddings, have provided the computational creativity
community with new tools, opening new perspectives for artistic pursuits.
Text-to-image synthesis approaches that operate by generating images from text
cues provide a case in point. These images are generated with a latent vector
that is progressively refined to agree with text cues. To do so, patches are
sampled within the generated image, and compared with the text prompts in the
common text-image embedding space; The latent vector is then updated, using
gradient descent, to reduce the mean (average) distance between these patches
and text cues. While this approach provides artists with ample freedom to
customize the overall appearance of images, through their choice in generative
models, the reliance on a simple criterion (mean of distances) often causes
mode collapse: The entire image is drawn to the average of all text cues,
thereby losing their diversity. To address this issue, we propose using
matching techniques found in the optimal transport (OT) literature, resulting
in images that are able to reflect faithfully a wide diversity of prompts. We
provide numerous illustrations showing that OT avoids some of the pitfalls
arising from estimating vectors with mean distances, and demonstrate the
capacity of our proposed method to perform better in experiments, qualitatively
and quantitatively.

is a challenging task under realistic privacy constraints. The KWS is designed
to only collect data when the keyword is present, limiting the availability of
hard samples that may contain false negatives, and preventing direct estimation
of model recall from production data. Alternatively, complementary data
collected from other sources may not be fully representative of the real
application. In this work, we propose an evaluation technique which we call
AB/BA analysis. Our framework evaluates a candidate KWS model B against a
baseline model A, using cross-dataset offline decoding for relative recall
estimation, without requiring negative examples. Moreover, we propose a
formulation with assumptions that allow estimation of relative false positive
rate between models with low variance even when the number of false positives
is small. Finally, we propose to leverage machine-generated soft labels, in a
technique we call Semi-Supervised AB/BA analysis, that improves the analysis

that AB/BA analysis is successful at measuring recall improvement in
conjunction with the trade-off in relative false positive rate.

tremendous improvement in recent years. Specifically, numerous domain

optical remote sensing image understanding, including remote sensing image
classification, pixel-wise segmentation, change detection, and object
detection. The methods based on supervised learning need a large amount of
high-quality training data and their performance highly depends on the quality
of the labels. However, in practical remote sensing applications, it is often
expensive and time-consuming to obtain large-scale data sets with high-quality
labels, which leads to a lack of sufficient supervised information. In some
cases, only coarse-grained labels can be obtained, resulting in the lack of
exact supervision. In addition, the supervised information obtained manually
may be wrong, resulting in a lack of accurate supervision. Therefore, remote
sensing image understanding often faces the problems of incomplete, inexact,
and inaccurate supervised information, which will affect the breadth and depth
of remote sensing applications. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems,
researchers have explored various tasks in remote sensing image understanding
under weak supervision. This paper summarizes the research progress of weakly
supervised learning in the field of remote sensing, including three typical
weakly supervised paradigms: 1) Incomplete supervision, where only a subset of
training data is labeled; 2) Inexact supervision, where only coarse-grained
labels of training data are given; 3) Inaccurate supervision, where the labels

of its efficiency and effectiveness. However, deep hashing models are
vulnerable to adversarial examples, making it essential to develop adversarial
defense methods for image retrieval. Existing solutions achieved limited
defense performance because of using weak adversarial samples for training and
lacking discriminative optimization objectives to learn robust features. In
this paper, we present a min-max based Center-guided Adversarial Training,
namely CgAT, to improve the robustness of deep hashing networks through worst
adversarial examples. Specifically, we first formulate the center code as a
semantically-discriminative representative of the input image content, which
preserves the semantic similarity with positive samples and dissimilarity with
negative examples. We prove that a mathematical formula can calculate the
center code immediately. After obtaining the center codes in each optimization
iteration of the deep hashing network, they are adopted to guide the
adversarial training process. On the one hand, CgAT generates the worst
adversarial examples as augmented data by maximizing the Hamming distance
between the hash codes of the adversarial examples and the center codes. On the
other hand, CgAT learns to mitigate the effects of adversarial samples by
minimizing the Hamming distance to the center codes. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial
training algorithm in defending against adversarial attacks for deep
hashing-based retrieval. Compared with the current state-of-the-art defense

dislocations in the bulk Pd-D2 system was carried out. Lattice misfit between
the alpha and beta hydride phases produces dislocations during the phase
transition in either direction, relieving elastic strain, which is reflected in
reduced pressure hysteresis compared to the spinodal hysteresis. The effects on
the dislocation density of annealing the metal under vacuum, of annealing in
the beta hydride phase, and of the phase transformation itself were
investigated by measuring diffraction peak breadths during annealing and
hydrogen cycling. During annealing under vacuum the dislocations were removed
at a lower temperature than was previously reported, but annealing in the beta
phase gave nearly the same result. However, when cycling hydrogen in and out of
the sample, the dislocation density decreased much faster with increasing
temperature compared to annealing. In other words the process of phase
transformation allows for healing of dislocations at lower temperatures than
would be required to anneal them purely by heating. This healing effect was
observed during both absorption and desorption. This result illuminates the
mechanism by which misfit dislocations can be healed at the same rate that they
are created in a sample undergoing absorption-desorption cycling, as proposed
in theoretical models of the origin of pressure hysteresis.

""sensitive attribute"" or ""protected category"" (such as race, ethnicity, gender,

across groups, however this data is largely unavailable in practice, hindering
the widespread adoption of algorithmic fairness. Through this paper, we
consider calls to collect more data on demographics to enable algorithmic
fairness and challenge the notion that discrimination can be overcome with
smart enough technical methods and sufficient data alone. We show how these
techniques largely ignore broader questions of data governance and systemic
oppression when categorizing individuals for the purpose of fairer algorithmic
processing. In this work, we explore under what conditions demographic data
should be collected and used to enable algorithmic fairness methods by
characterizing a range of social risks to individuals and communities. For the
risks to individuals we consider the unique privacy risks associated with the
sharing of sensitive attributes likely to be the target of fairness analysis,
the possible harms stemming from miscategorizing and misrepresenting
individuals in the data collection process, and the use of sensitive data
beyond data subjects' expectations. Looking more broadly, the risks to entire
groups and communities include the expansion of surveillance infrastructure in
the name of fairness, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing what it means to be
part of a demographic group or to hold a certain identity, and ceding the
ability to define for themselves what constitutes biased or unfair treatment.
We argue that, by confronting these questions before and during the collection
of demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually
mitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of
oppression.

the fundamental bright soliton solution for the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation. Similar to a Gaussian profile, the Fourier transform
for the hyperbolic secant shape is also shape-preserving. We further confirm
that the fundamental soliton indeed satisfies essential characteristics such as
Parseval's relation and the stretch-bandwidth reciprocity relationship. The
fundamental bright solitons find rich applications in nonlinear fiber optics
and optical telecommunication systems.

  DNA Nanotechnology Simulations",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.CV cs.GR physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We propose a new abstraction set (SynopSet) that has a continuum of visual
representations for the explanatory analysis of molecular dynamics simulations
(MDS) in the DNA nanotechnology domain. By re-purposing the commonly used
progress bar and designing novel visuals, as well as transforming the data from
the domain format to a format that better fits the newly designed visuals, we
compose this new set of representations. This set is also designed to be
capable of showing all spatial and temporal details, and all structural
complexity, or abstracting these to various degrees, enabling both the slow
playback of the simulation for detailed examinations or very fast playback for
an overview that helps to efficiently identify events of interest, as well as
several intermediate levels between these two extremes. For any pair of
successive representations, we demonstrate smooth, continuous transitions,
enabling users to keep track of relevant information from one representation to
the next. By providing multiple representations suited to different temporal
resolutions and connected by smooth transitions, we enable time-efficient
simulation analysis, giving users the opportunity to examine and present
important phases in great detail, or leverage abstract representations to go
over uneventful phases much faster. Domain experts can thus gain actionable
insight about their simulations and communicate it in a much shorter time.
Further, the novel representations are more intuitive and also enable
researchers unfamiliar with MDS analysis graphs to better understand the
simulation results. We assessed the effectiveness of SynopSet on 12 DNA
nanostructure simulations together with a domain expert. We have also shown
that our set of representations can be systematically located in a
visualization space, dubbed SynopSpace.

  Systems Towards Safer Road Infrastructure",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Single-vehicle accidents are the most common type of fatal accidents in
Sweden, where a car drives off the road and runs into hazardous roadside
objects. Proper installation and maintenance of protective objects, such as
crash cushions and guard rails, may reduce the chance and severity of such
accidents. Moreover, efficient detection and management of hazardous roadside
objects also plays an important role in improving road safety. To better
understand the state-of-the-art and system requirements, in this pre-study, we
investigate the feasibility, implementation, limitations and scaling up of data
processing pipelines for roadside object detection. In particular, we divide
our investigation into three parts: the target of interest, the sensors of
choice and the algorithm design. The data sources we consider in this study
cover two common setups: 1) road surveying fleet - annual scans conducted by
Trafikverket, the Swedish Transport Administration, and 2) consumer vehicle -
data collected using a research vehicle from the laboratory of Resource for
vehicle research at Chalmers (REVERE). The goal of this report is to
investigate how to implement a scalable roadside object detection system
towards safe road infrastructure and Sweden's Vision Zero.
