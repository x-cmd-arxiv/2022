circumbinary discs consisting of gas and dust, with and without embedded
planets, to examine the influence of the dust on the structure of the tidally
truncated inner cavity and on the parking locations of migrating planets. In
this proof-of-concept study, we consider Kepler-16 and -34 analogues, and
examine dust fluids with Stokes numbers in the range $10^{-4} \le St \le
10^{-1}$ and dust-to-gas ratios of 0.01 and 1. For the canonical dust-to-gas
ratio of 0.01, we find the inclusion of the dust has only a minor effect on the
cavity and stopping locations of embedded planets compared to dust-free
simulations. However, for the enhanced dust-to-gas ratio of unity, assumed to
arise because of significant dust drift and accumulation, we find that the dust
can have a dramatic effect by shrinking and circularising the inner cavity,
which brings the parking locations of planets closer to the central binary.
This work demonstrates the importance of considering both gas and dust in
studies of circumbinary discs and planets, and provides a potential means of
explaining the orbital properties of circumbinary planets such as Kepler-34b,
which have hitherto been difficult to explain using gas-only hydrodynamical
simulations.

they have been lucrative targets for cyber attackers. These critical
infrastructures are usually Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as power grids,
water, and sewage treatment facilities, oil and gas pipelines, etc. In recent
times, these systems have suffered from cyber attacks numerous times.
Researchers have been developing cyber security solutions for CIs to avoid
lasting damages. According to standard frameworks, cyber security based on
identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery are at the core
of these research. Detection of an ongoing attack that escapes standard
protection such as firewall, anti-virus, and host/network intrusion detection
has gained importance as such attacks eventually affect the physical dynamics
of the system. Therefore, anomaly detection in physical dynamics proves an
effective means to implement defense-in-depth. PASAD is one example of anomaly
detection in the sensor/actuator data, representing such systems' physical
dynamics. We present EPASAD, which improves the detection technique used in
PASAD to detect these micro-stealthy attacks, as our experiments show that
PASAD's spherical boundary-based detection fails to detect. Our method EPASAD
overcomes this by using Ellipsoid boundaries, thereby tightening the boundaries
in various dimensions, whereas a spherical boundary treats all dimensions
equally. We validate EPASAD using the dataset produced by the TE-process
simulator and the C-town datasets. The results show that EPASAD improves
PASAD's average recall by 5.8% and 9.5% for the two datasets, respectively.

the dominant acceleration axis - data that is collected by a network of

for best tracking of acoustically tagged marine megafauna. The outcomes of such
tracking allows the evaluation of the animals' motion patterns, their hours of
activity, and their social interactions. In particular, we focus on how to
determine the receivers' deployment positions to maximize the coverage area in
which the tagged animals can be tracked. For example, an overly-condensed
deployment may not allow accurate tracking, whereas a sparse one, may lead to a
small coverage area due to too few detections. We formalize the question of
where to best deploy the receivers as a non-convex constraint optimization
problem that takes into account the local environment and the specifications of
the tags, and offer a sub-optimal, low-complexity solution that can be applied

Acceptance algorithm needs complete preference lists. In practice, preference
lists are short, yet stable matching still works well. This raises two
questions:
  $\bullet$ Why does it work well?
  $\bullet$ Which proposals should agents include in their preference lists?
  We study these questions in a model, introduced by Lee [17], with preferences
based on correlated cardinal utilities: these utilities are based on common
public ratings of each agent together with individual private adjustments. Lee
showed that for suitable utility functions, in large markets, with high
probability, for most agents, all stable matchings yield similar valued
utilities. By means of a new analysis, we strengthen Lee's result, showing that
in large markets, with high probability, for $\it all$ but the agents with the
lowest public ratings, all stable matchings yield similar valued utilities. We
can then deduce that for $\it all$ but the agents with the lowest public
ratings, each agent has an easily identified length $O(\log n)$ preference list
that includes all of its stable matches, addressing the second question above.
We note that this identification uses an initial communication phase.
  We extend these results to settings where the two sides have unequal numbers
of agents, to many-to-one settings, e.g. employers and workers, and we also
show the existence of an $\epsilon$-Bayes-Nash equilibrium in which every agent
makes relatively few proposals. These results all rely on a new technique for
sidestepping the conditioning between the tentative matching events that occur
over the course of a run of the Deferred Acceptance algorithm. We complement
these theoretical results with an experimental study.

trade-off integrals, which capture the sensitivity characteristics of the

systems. Compared with the previous analyses based on complex analysis and
Cauchy's residue theorem, the analysis results derived from the simplified
method are more explicit, thorough, and require less restrictive assumptions.
For continuous-time filtering systems, our simplified analysis reveals that
apart from the non-minimum phase zero sets reported in the previous literature,
the value and boundedness of filtering sensitivity integrals are also
determined by the leading coefficients, relative degrees, minimum phase zeros,
and poles of plants and filters. By invoking the simplified method, a
comprehensive analysis on the discrete-time filtering sensitivity integrals is
conducted for the first time. Numerical examples are provided to verify the

a PLM-based CCF model in an end-to-end (E2E) manner, since optimization

The game industry is increasingly growing in recent years. Every
day, millions of people play video games, not only as a hobby, but also for
professional competitions (e.g., e-sports or speed-running) or for making
business by entertaining others (e.g., streamers). The latter daily produce a
large amount of gameplay videos in which they also comment live what they
experience. Since no software and, thus, no video game is perfect, streamers
may encounter several problems (such as bugs, glitches, or performance issues).
However, it is unlikely that they explicitly report such issues to developers.
The identified problems may negatively impact the user's gaming experience and,
in turn, can harm the reputation of the game and of the producer. Objective. We
aim at proposing and empirically evaluating GELID, an approach for
automatically extracting relevant information from gameplay videos by (i)
identifying video segments in which streamers experienced anomalies; (ii)
categorizing them based on their type and context in which appear (e.g., bugs
or glitches appearing in a specific level or scene of the game); and (iii)
clustering segments that regard the same specific issue. Method. We will build
on top of existing approaches able to identify videos that are relevant for a
specific video game. These represent the input of GELID that processes them to
achieve the defined objectives. We will experiment GELID on several gameplay
videos to understand the extent to which each of its steps is effective.

""warped jigsaw"" (WJ) shape design: directional bonds in a tapered particle
favor curvature along multi-particle rows that frustrate 2D lattice order. We
investigate how large-scale intra-assembly stress gradients emerge from the
microscopic properties of the particles using a combination of numerical
simulation and continuum elasticity. WJ particles can favor anisotropic ribbon
assemblies, whose lateral width may be self-limiting depending on the relative
strength of cohesive to elastic forces in the assembly, which we show to be
controlled by the range of interactions and degree of shape misfit. The upper
limits of self-limited size are controlled by the crossover between two elastic
modes in assembly: the accumulation of shear with increasing width at small
widths giving way to unbending of preferred row curvature, permitting assembly
to grow to unlimited sizes. We show that the stiffness controlling distinct
elastic modes is governed by combination and placement of repulsive and
attractive binding regions, providing a means to extend the range of
accumulating stress to sizes that are far in excess of the single particle
size, which we corroborate via numerical studies of discrete particles of
variable interactions. Lastly, we relate the ground-state energetics of the
model to lower and upper limits on equilibrium assembly size control set by the
fluctuations of width along the ribbon boundary.

(amorphous) and 20, 40, 60, and 80 K (crystalline) - relevant to the outer

(Hapke, 1993) from the optical constant at NIR wavelengths (1 - 5 $\mu$m). This

much better compared to the amorphous phase at temperatures of 15 - 80 K.
However, the Hapke slab model estimates much approximate grain sizes, in
general, to that of the Mie model's prediction while ISM exhibits a higher
uncertainty. We recommend using the Mie model for unknown spectra of outer
solar system bodies and beyond in estimating H${}_{2}$O ice grain sizes. While
choosing the approximation model for employing RTMs, we recommend using a Hapke

systems by comparing a nonequilibrium transport approach, the
Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD), with a (2+1)D viscous hydrodynamic model,
VISHNew. Focusing on p+Pb collisions at LHC energy, we extract the initial
conditions for the hydrodynamic model from PHSD, in order to reduce the impact
of the early out-of-equilibrium dynamics and focus on the traces of
nonequilibiurm in the ensuing medium evolution. We find that in the transport
approach quantities like energy density and bulk viscous pressure are highly
inhomogeneous on the transverse plane during the whole evolution, whereas the
hydrodynamic simulations dissolve more efficiently the initial spatial
irregularities, still keeping a high degree of inhomogeneity due to the smaller
size and lifetime of the medium produced in p+Pb collisions with respect to
heavy-ion reactions. As a first step that will help to identify the impact of
these nonequilibrium effects on final observables in proton-nucleus collisions,
we perform an analysis of the transverse spherocity, an event-shape observable
able to distinguish between jetty and isotropic configurations of transverse
momenta. We found that the spherocity distribution in PHSD is slightly shifted
towards the isotropic limit with respect to the hydrodynamic result. Even
though this dissimilarity is partially due to the difference in the final
charged particle production, it mainly comes from the different description
within the two frameworks of the medium produced in small colliding systems.
This finding supports the idea that multi-differential measurements, such as
those based on event categorization according to multiplicity and spherocity,
are useful to study final-state observables in ultrarelativistic proton-nucleus
collisions.

particularly crucial in preparing for the upcoming observations. In the effort
of achieving 3D chemistry-climate modeling, the challenge mainly lies in the
expensive computing power required for treating a large number of chemical
species and reactions. Motivated by the need for a robust and computationally
efficient chemical scheme, we devise a mini-chemical network with a minimal
number of species and reactions for H$_2$-dominated atmospheres. We apply a
novel technique to simplify the chemical network from a full kinetics model --
VULCAN by replacing a large number of intermediate reactions with net
reactions. The number of chemical species is cut down from 67 to 12, with the
major species of thermal and observational importance retained, including
H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, NH$_3$, and HCN. The size of the total
reactions is greatly reduced from $\sim$ 800 to 20. The mini-chemical scheme is
validated by verifying the temporal evolution and benchmarking the predicted
compositions in four exoplanet atmospheres (GJ 1214b, GJ 436b, HD 189733b, HD
209458b) against the full kinetics of VULCAN. It reproduces the chemical
timescales and composition distributions of the full kinetics well within an
order of magnitude for the major species in the pressure range of 1 bar -- 0.1
mbar across various metallicities and carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios. The small
scale of the mini-chemical scheme permits simple use and fast computation,
which is optimal for implementation in a 3D GCM or a retrieval framework. We
focus on the thermochemical kinetics of net reactions in this paper and address
photochemistry in a follow-up paper.

constrain the masses and bulk densities of Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.
Comparisons of different techniques for deriving the semimajor axis and
eccentricity of the four satellites favor methods relying on the theory of Lee
& Peale (2006), where satellite orbits are derived in the context of the
restricted three body problem (Pluto, Charon, and one massless satellite). In
each simulation, we adopt the nominal satellite masses derived in Kenyon &
Bromley (2019a), multiply the mass of at least one satellite by a numerical
factor $f \ge 1$, and establish whether the system ejects at least one
satellite on a time scale $\le$ 4.5 Gyr. When the total system mass is large
($f \gg 1$), ejections of Kerberos are more common. Systems with lower
satellite masses ($ f \approx$ 1) usually eject Styx. In these calculations,
Styx often `signals' an ejection by moving to higher orbital inclination long
before ejection; Kerberos rarely signals in a useful way. The n-body results
suggest that Styx and Kerberos are more likely to have bulk densities
comparable with water ice, $\rho_{SK} \lesssim$ 2 g cm$^{-3}$, than with rock.
A strong upper limit on the total system mass, $M_{SNKH} \lesssim 9.5 \times
10^{19}$ g, also places robust constraints on the average bulk density of the
four satellites, $\rho_{SNKH} \lesssim$ 1.4 g cm$^{-3}$. These limits support
models where the satellites grow out of icy material ejected during a major
impact on Pluto or Charon.

related to recent star formation. However, it is observationally expensive to
construct large samples of H$\rm\alpha$ emitters by spectroscopic or
narrow-band imaging survey at high-redshifts. In this work, we demonstrate a
method to extract H$\rm\alpha$ fluxes of galaxies at $z=2.1$-$2.5$ from $K_s$

estimate the emission line fluxes by SED fitting with stellar population models
that incorporate emission-line strengths. 2005 galaxies are selected as
H$\rm\alpha$ emitters by our method and their fluxes show good agreement with
previous measurements in the literature. On the other hand, there are more
H$\rm\alpha$ luminous galaxies than previously reported. The discrepancy can be
explained by extended H$\rm\alpha$ profiles of massive galaxies and a
luminosity dependence of dust attenuation, which are not taken into account in
the previous work. We also find that there are a large number of low-mass
galaxies with much higher specific star formation rate (sSFR) than expected
from the extrapolated star formation main sequence. Such low-mass galaxies
exhibit larger ratios between H$\rm\alpha$ and UV fluxes compared to more
massive high sSFR galaxies. This result implies that a ``starburst'' mode may
differ among galaxies: low-mass galaxies appear to assemble their stellar mass
via short-duration bursts while more massive galaxies tend to experience
longer-duration ($>10\ \mathrm{Myr}$) bursts.

Mercury's core makes up 70% of the planetary mass, which implies a significant
enrichment of iron relative to silicates, while its mantle is strongly depleted
in oxidized iron. The high core mass fraction is traditionally ascribed to
evaporative loss of silicates, e.g. following a giant impact, but the high
abundance of moderately volatile elements in the mantle of Mercury is
inconsistent with reaching temperatures much above 1,000 K during its
formation. Here we explore the nucleation of solid particles from a gas of
solar composition that cools down in the hot inner regions of the
protoplanetary disc. The high surface tension of iron causes iron particles to
nucleate homogeneously (i.e., not on a more refractory substrate) under very
high supersaturation. The low nucleation rates lead to depositional growth of
large iron pebbles on a sparse population of nucleated iron nano-particles.
Silicates in the form of iron-free MgSiO$_3$ nucleate at similar temperatures
but obtain smaller sizes due to the much higher number of nucleated particles.
This results in a chemical separation of large iron particles from silicate
particles with ten times lower Stokes numbers. We propose that such conditions
lead to the formation of iron-rich planetesimals by the streaming instability.
In this view, Mercury formed by accretion of iron-rich planetesimals with a
sub-solar abundance of highly reduced silicate material. Our results imply that
the iron-rich planets known to orbit the Sun and other stars are not required
to have experienced mantle-stripping impacts. Instead their formation could be
a direct consequence of temperature fluctuations in protoplanetary discs and
chemical separation of distinct crystal species through the ensuing nucleation
process.

define constraints before-hand, and sift through the results afterwards, to an
interactive one. This new framework depends on exploiting user feedback to
learn a quality function for patterns. Existing approaches have a weakness in
that they use static pre-defined low-level features, and attempt to learn
independent weights representing their importance to the user. As an
alternative, we propose to work with more complex features that are derived
directly from the pattern ranking imposed by the user. Learned weights are then
aggregated onto lower-level features and help to drive the quality function in
the right direction. We explore the effect of different parameter choices
experimentally and find that using higher-complexity features leads to the
selection of patterns that are better aligned with a hidden quality function
while not adding significantly to the run times of the method.
  Getting good user feedback requires to quickly present diverse patterns,
something that we achieve but pushing an existing diversity constraint into the

zone. However, even within the habitable zone planets can still develop
uninhabitable climate states. Sustaining a temperate climate over geologic
($\sim$Gyr) timescales requires a planet contain sufficient internal energy to
power a planetary-scale carbon cycle. A major component of a rocky planet's
energy budget is the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements,
especially $^{40}$K, $^{232}$Th, $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U. As the planet ages
and these elements decay, this radiogenic energy source dwindles. Here we
estimate the probability distribution of the amount of these heat producing
elements (HPEs) that enter into rocky exoplanets through Galactic history, by
combining the system-to-system variation seen in stellar abundance data with
the results from Galactic chemical evolution models. Using these distributions,
we perform Monte-Carlo thermal evolution models that maximize the mantle
cooling rate. This allows us to create a pessimistic estimate of lifetime a
rocky, stagnant-lid exoplanet can support a global carbon cycle and temperate
climate as a function of its mass and when it in Galactic history. We apply
this framework to a sample of 17 likely rocky exoplanets with measured ages, 7
of which we predict are likely to be actively degassing today despite our
pessimistic assumptions. For the remaining planets, including those orbiting
TRAPPIST-1, we cannot confidently assume they currently contain sufficient
internal heat to support mantle degassing at a rate sufficient to sustain a
global carbon cycle or temperate climate without additional tidal heating or
undergoing plate tectonics.

However, it is not clear how collaborative programming tasks change peer

We used a mixed-method approach comprising automated text analysis and
community extraction with further qualitative analysis. The results show that
students prefer to seek help in programming from peers and not the teacher.
Team assignment helped to support this habit. Students communicated more
positively and intensively with each other, while only team leaders
communicated with the instructor reducing teacher overload. This shift could
explain how peer communication improves learning outcomes, as has been shown in

5 people and is widely regarded as an attack on democracy. The storming was
largely coordinated through social media networks such as Parler. Yet little is
known regarding how users interacted on Parler during the storming of the
Capitol. In this work, we examine the emotion dynamics on Parler during the
storming with regard to heterogeneity across time and users. For this, we
segment the user base into different groups (e.g., Trump supporters and QAnon
supporters). We use affective computing (Kratzwald et al. 2018) to infer the
emotions in the contents, thereby allowing us to provide a comprehensive
assessment of online emotions. Our evaluation is based on a large-scale dataset
from Parler, comprising of 717,300 posts from 144,003 users. We find that the
user base responded to the storming of the Capitol with an overall negative
sentiment. Akin to this, Trump supporters also expressed a negative sentiment
and high levels of unbelief. In contrast to that, QAnon supporters did not
express a more negative sentiment during the storming. We further provide a
cross-platform analysis and compare the emotion dynamics on Parler and Twitter.
Our findings point at a comparatively less negative response to the incidents
on Parler compared to Twitter accompanied by higher levels of disapproval and
outrage. Our contribution to research is three-fold: (1) We identify online
emotions that were characteristic of the storming; (2) we assess emotion
dynamics across different user groups on Parler; (3) we compare the emotion
dynamics on Parler and Twitter. Thereby, our work offers important implications
for actively managing online emotions to prevent similar incidents in the
future.

limited CO due to the strong redox disequilibrium between CH$_4$ and CO$_2$.
Methane is thus more likely to be biogenic for planets with 1) a terrestrial
bulk density, high mean-molecular-weight and anoxic atmosphere, and an old host

rich than WCs, and thus further evolved. However, previous studies have failed
to model this line, leaving the relative abundances uncertain, and the
relationship between the two types unresolved. To answer this fundamental
question, we modeled six WCs and two WOs in the LMC using UV, optical, and NIR
spectra with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN in order to determine their
physical properties. We find that WOs are not richer in oxygen; rather, the O
VI feature is insensitive to the abundance. However, the WOs have a
significantly higher carbon and lower helium content than the WCs, and hence
are further evolved. A comparison of our results with single-star Geneva and
binary BPASS evolutionary models show that while many properties match, there
is more carbon and less oxygen in the WOs than either set of evolutionary model
predicts. This discrepancy may be due to the large uncertainty in the

the utility of BioRED by benchmarking several existing state-of-the-art

that while existing approaches can reach high performance on the NER task

are predicted for odd-layer compounds and axion insulator states for the
even-layer compounds. Unfortunately, the realization of these phenomena has
been hindered by experimental challenges such as the existence of negative
charge carriers, i.e., electron doping, which have been linked to anti-site
defects among the Mn and Bi sub-lattices. Based on high level diffusion Monte
Carlo (DMC) and DMC-tuned DFT+U calculations, we provide benchmark quality
results for the bulk Mn magnetization as well as for Mn$_{Bi}$ and Bi$_{Mn}$

lab with a good experimental sensitivity over a broad axion mass range. The
scheme relies on using laser-based four-wave mixing, which is mediated by the
hypothetical axion field. Intense pump and Stokes laser beams that are confined
to a waveguide (i.e., for example, an optical fiber) with appropriately chosen
frequencies resonantly drive axion generation. Under such a geometry, we
predict the existence of guided axion waves, which we refer to as ""axitons"".
These are solutions of the axion Klein-Gordon field equation that are spatially
guided by the profiles of the driving pump and Stokes laser beams. These guided
axitons can then couple to a nearby fiber and mix with another laser, affecting
the propagation of a probe laser beam. A key advantage of the scheme is that
the mass range of the hypothetical axion can be scanned by varying the
frequencies of the pump and the Stokes laser beams. We predict that, using
reasonable parameters, the technique will be able to detect axions in the mass
range $10^{-6} $eV $< m<$ $10^{-2} $eV with a sensitivity at the level of
$10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for the axion-photon coupling constant.

an image-specific manner. The classification scores, obtained using CNN, of all

initialize our loss function population with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and
perform multi-objective optimization using fitness metrics encoding single-task
performance, zero-shot generalizability to unseen environment configurations,
and stability across independent runs with different random seeds. On a set of
continuous control tasks from the Real-World RL Benchmark Suite, we find that
our method, using a single environment during evolution, evolves algorithms
that improve upon SAC's performance and generalizability by 4% and 20%,
respectively, and reduce instability up to 67%. Then, we scale up to more
complex environments from the Brax physics simulator and replicate
generalizability tests encountered in practical settings, such as different
friction coefficients. MetaPG evolves algorithms that can obtain 10% better
generalizability without loss of performance within the same meta-training
environment and obtain similar results to SAC when doing cross-domain
evaluations in other Brax environments. The evolution results are
interpretable; by analyzing the structure of the best algorithms we identify
elements that help optimizing certain objectives, such as regularization terms
for the critic loss.

distributions are non-stationary during continual online learning; learning of

approach is model-agnostic continual meta-learning, whereby both task-specific
and meta parameters are trained. Here, we depart from this view and introduce a
novel neural-network architecture inspired by neuromodulation in biological
nervous systems. Neuromodulation is the biological mechanism that dynamically
controls and fine-tunes synaptic dynamics to complement the behavioral context
in real-time, which has received limited attention in machine learning. We
introduce a single-hidden-layer network that learns only a relatively small
context vector per task (task-specific parameters) that neuromodulates
unchanging, randomized weights (meta parameters) that transform the input. We
show that when task boundaries are available, this approach can eliminate
catastrophic forgetting entirely while also drastically reducing the number of
learnable parameters relative to other context-vector-based approaches.
Furthermore, by combining this model with a simple meta-learning approach for
inferring task identity, we demonstrate that the model can be generalized into
a framework to perform continual learning without knowledge of task boundaries.
Finally, we showcase the framework in a supervised continual online learning
scenario and discuss the implications of the proposed formalism.

  Path Problems",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several goal-oriented problems in the real-world can be naturally expressed
as Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs). However, the computational
complexity of solving SSPs makes finding solutions to even moderately sized
problems intractable. Currently, existing state-of-the-art planners and
heuristics often fail to exploit knowledge learned from solving other
instances. This paper presents an approach for learning \emph{Generalized
Policy Automata} (GPA): non-deterministic partial policies that can be used to
catalyze the solution process. GPAs are learned using relational, feature-based
abstractions, which makes them applicable on broad classes of related problems
with different object names and quantities. Theoretical analysis of this
approach shows that it guarantees completeness and hierarchical optimality.
Empirical analysis shows that this approach effectively learns broadly
applicable policy knowledge in a few-shot fashion and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art SSP solvers on test problems whose object counts are far
greater than those used during training.

established type of ferroic state. It is based on a spontaneous and uniform
alignment of unit-cell-sized magnetic whirls, called magneto-toroidal moments,
associated with a macroscopic toroidization. Because of its intrinsic
magnetoelectric coupling, this new ferroic state could be useful in the
development of spintronic devices. We exploit two-dimensional periodic arrays
of magnetostatically coupled nanomagnets as model systems for the investigation
of long-range magneto-toroidal order. We present two pathways promoting this
order, namely (i), structures comprising a ring of uniformly magnetized
sub-micrometer-sized bar magnets and (ii), structures in which each magnetic
building block itself hosts a magnetic vortex. For both cases calculations of
the magnetic-dipole interaction and micromagnetic simulations reveal the
conditions for the formation of spontaneous magneto-toroidal order. We confirm
this order and the formation of magneto-toroidal domains in our arrays by
magnetic force microscopy. We identify the presence of two types of domain-wall
states emerging from the competition of two intrinsic microscopic couplings.
Our work not only identifies the microscopic conditions promoting spontaneous
magneto-toroidal order but also highlights the possibility tailor mesoscale
magnetic arrays towards elusive types of ferroic order.

blood glycoprotein von Willebrand Factor (vWF). vWF unfolds in response to
strong flow gradients and facilitates rapid recruitment of platelets in flowing
blood. While the thrombogenic effect of vWF is well recognized, its
conformational response in complex flows has largely been omitted from
numerical models of thrombosis. We recently presented a continuum model for the
unfolding of vWF, where we represented vWF transport and its flow-induced
conformational change using convection-diffusion-reaction equations. Here, we
incorporate the vWF component into our multi-constituent model of thrombosis,
where the local concentration of stretched vWF amplifies the deposition rate of
free-flowing platelets and reduces the shear cleaning of deposited platelets.
We validate the model using three benchmarks: in vitro model of
atherothrombosis, a stagnation point flow, and the PFA-100, a clinical blood
test commonly used for screening for von Willebrand Disease (vWD). The
simulations reproduced the key aspects of vWF-mediated thrombosis observed in
these experiments, such as the thrombus location, thrombus growth dynamics, and
the effect of blocking platelet-vWF interactions. The PFA-100 simulations
closely matched the reported occlusion times for normal blood and several
hemostatic deficiencies, namely, thrombocytopenia, vWD Type 1, and vWD Type 3.
Overall, the multi-constituent model of thrombosis presented in this work
enables macro-scale 3-D simulations of thrombus formation in complex geometries
over a wide range of shear rates and accounts for qualitative and quantitative
hemostatic deficiencies in patient blood. The results also demonstrate the
utility of the continuum model of vWF unfolding that could be adapted to other
numerical models of thrombosis.

medicare claims to extend the follow-up period for participants in a prostate

missing data problem with careful considerations of the relationship between
the linkage status and the missing data mechanism. We use the popular Cox
proportional hazard model as a working model to define the long-term effect. We
propose a conditional linking at random (CLAR) assumption and an inverse
probability of linkage weighting (IPLW) partial likelihood estimator. We show
that our IPLW partial likelihood estimator is consistent and asymptotically
normal. We further extend our approach to incorporate time-dependent

extracted that could be integrated into datasets from meteorological stations.
From this, 3 different models were built, on which the performance of 5 machine
learning algorithms in predicting solar radiation was evaluated. The neural
networks had the highest performance in the model that integrated the
meteorological variables and the variables obtained from the images, according
to an analysis carried out using four evaluation metrics; although if the rRMSE
is considered, all results obtained were higher than 20%, which classified the
performance of the algorithms as fair. In the 2012 dataset, the estimation
results according to the metrics MBE, R2, RMSE, and rRMSE corresponded to

broadens and challenges our current understanding of glasses by considering
novel internal out-of-equilibrium degrees of freedom. In previous experimental
studies we have shown that in the ergodicity broken phase, the dynamics of
dense passive particles first slows down as particles are made slightly active,
before speeding up at larger activity. Here, we show that this nonmonotonic
behavior also emerges in simulations of soft active Brownian particles and
explore its cause. We refute that the Deadlock by Emergence of Active
Directionality (DEAD) model we proposed earlier describes our data. However, we
demonstrate that the nonmonotonic response is due to activity enhanced aging,

master equation of a potential mean field game and to prove that existence and
uniqueness hold under quite general assumptions. Remarkably, this is achieved
without any monotonicity constraint on the coefficients. The key point is to
interpret the master equation in a conservative sense and then to adapt to the
infinite dimensional setting earlier arguments for hyperbolic systems deriving
from a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Here, the master equation is indeed
regarded as an infinite dimensional system set on the space of probability
measures and is formally written as the derivative of the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the mean field control problem
lying above the mean field game. To make the analysis easier, we assume that
the coefficients are periodic, which allows to represent probability measures
through their Fourier coefficients. Most of the analysis then consists in
rewriting the master equation and the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation for the mean field control problem as partial differential equations
set on the Fourier coefficients themselves. In the end, we establish existence
and uniqueness of functions that are displacement semi-concave in the measure
argument and that solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in a suitable
generalized sense and, subsequently, we get existence and uniqueness of
functions that solve the master equation in an appropriate weak sense and that
satisfy a weak one-sided Lipschitz inequality. As another new result, we also
prove that the optimal trajectories of the associated mean field control
problem are unique for almost every starting point, for a suitable probability

been exploited to generate complex translational and rotational dynamics in

Here, we consider an optical tweezers system with a tilted stratified medium
(direction of stratification at an angle with the axis of the incident beam),
and show that for input circularly polarized Gaussian beams, the resulting
spin-orbit interaction deeply influences the generation of transverse spin
angular momentum (TSAM) and Belinfante momentum of light, and allows additional
control on their magnitude. Importantly, the TSAM generated in our system
consists of both the orthogonal components, which is in sharp contrast to the
case of evanescent waves and surface plasmons, where only one of the TSAM
components are generated. The broken symmetry due to the tilt ensures that,
depending upon the helicity of the input beam, the magnitude of the mutually
orthogonal components of the TSAM depend entirely on the tilt angle. This may
prove to be an effective handle in exotic spin-controlled manipulation of
particles in experiments.

Lipschitz estimate \[ {\rm Lip}(u|_B)\leq \frac {C(K^-R^2,N)}r\inf_{{\sf o}\in
{\rm Y}}\,\sqrt{\frac1{{\mathfrak m}(2B)}\int_{2B}{\sf d}_{\rm
Y}^2(u(\cdot),{\sf o})\, {\rm d}{\mathfrak m}}, \qquad \forall 2B\subset U \]
where $r\in(0,R)$ is the radius of $B$. This is obtained by combining classical
Moser's iteration, a Bochner-type inequality that we derive (guided by recent
works of Zhang-Zhu) together with a reverse Poincar\'e inequality that is also
established here. A direct consequence of our estimate is a Lioville-Yau type
theorem in the case $K=0$.
  Among the ingredients we develop for the proof, a variational principle valid
in general ${\sf RCD}$ spaces is particularly relevant. It can be roughly
stated as: if $({\rm X},{\sf d},{\mathfrak m})$ is ${\sf RCD}(K,\infty)$ and
$f\in C_b({\rm X})$ is so that $\Delta f\leq C$ for some constant $C>0$, then
for every $t>0$ and ${\mathfrak m}$-a.e.\ $x\in{\rm X}$ there is a unique
minimizer $F_t(x)$ for $ y\ \mapsto\ f(y)+\frac{{\sf d}^2(x,y)}{2t} $ and the
map $F_t$ satisfies \[ (F_t)_*{\mathfrak m}\leq e^{t(C+2K^-{\sf
Osc}(f))}{\mathfrak m},\qquad\text{where}\qquad {\sf Osc}(f):=\sup f-\inf f. \]
Here existence is in place without any sort of compactness assumption and
uniqueness should be intended in a sense analogue to that in place for Regular
Lagrangian Flows and Optimal Maps (and is related to both these concepts).
  Finally, we also obtain a Rademacher-type result for Lipschitz maps between
spaces as above.

categories. We use the enriched monoidal setting to construct a suitable
definition of structure preserving map between higher order physical theories
via the Grothendieck construction. We then show that the convenient feature of
currying in higher order physical theories can be seen as a consequence of
combining the primitive assumption of the existence of parallel and sequential
composition supermaps with an additional feature of linking. In a second
application we use our definition of structure preserving map to show that
categories containing infinite towers of enriched monoidal categories with full
and faithful structure preserving maps between them inevitably lead to closed
monoidal structures. The aim of the proposed definitions is to step towards
providing a broad framework for the study and comparison of novel causal

amount of memory and computation from large supercomputing clusters to provide
sufficient accuracy and resolution. The latest exascale machines poised to come
online contain a diverse set of computing architectures. In an effort to avoid
architecture specific programming and maintain productivity across platforms,
the ice-sheet modeling code known as MALI uses high level abstractions to
integrate Trilinos libraries and the Kokkos programming model for performance
portable code across a variety of different architectures. In this paper, we
analyze the performance portable features of MALI via a performance analysis on
current CPU-based and GPU-based supercomputers. The analysis highlights
performance portable improvements made in finite element assembly and multigrid
preconditioning within MALI with speedups between 1.26-1.82x across CPU and GPU
architectures but also identifies the need to further improve performance in
software coupling and preconditioning on GPUs. We also perform a weak
scalability study and show that simulations on GPU-based machines perform
1.24-1.92x faster when utilizing the GPUs. The best performance is found in
finite element assembly which achieved a speedup of up to 8.65x and a weak
scaling efficiency of 82.9% with GPUs. We additionally describe an automated
performance testing framework developed for this code base using a changepoint
detection method. The framework is used to make actionable decisions about
performance within MALI. We provide several concrete examples of scenarios in
which the framework has identified performance regressions, improvements, and
algorithm differences over the course of two years of development.

cameras may not be sufficiently accurate. This is at least in part due to our
inability to perfectly calibrate the coordinate frames of today's high degree
of freedom robot arms that link the head to the end-effectors. We present a
novel framework combining pre-touch sensing and deep learning to more
accurately estimate pose in an efficient manner. The use of pre-touch sensing
allows our method to localize the object directly with respect to the robot's
end effector, thereby avoiding error caused by miscalibration of the arms.
Instead of requiring the robot to scan the entire object with its pre-touch
sensor, we use a deep neural network to detect object regions that contain
distinctive geometric features. By focusing pre-touch sensing on these regions,
the robot can more efficiently gather the information necessary to adjust its
original pose estimate. Our region detection network was trained using a new
dataset containing objects of widely varying geometries and has been labeled in
a scalable fashion that is free from human bias. This dataset is applicable to
any task that involves a pre-touch sensor gathering geometric information, and
has been made publicly available. We evaluate our framework by having the robot
re-estimate the pose of a number of objects of varying geometries. Compared to
two simpler region proposal methods, we find that our deep neural network
performs significantly better. In addition, we find that after a sequence of
scans, objects can typically be localized to within 0.5 cm of their true
position. We also observe that the original pose estimate can often be
significantly improved after collecting a single quick scan.

the scientific community has paid considerable attention to the concept of
resilience engineering in recent years. Authorities and decision-makers, on the

help increase community resilience to different types of extreme events. Since
it is often impossible to prevent every risk, the focus is on adapting and
managing risks in ways that minimize impacts to communities (e.g., humans and
other systems). Several resilience strategies have been proposed in the
literature to reduce disaster risk and improve community resilience. Generally,
resilience assessment is challenging due to uncertainty and unavailability of
data necessary for the estimation process. This paper proposes a Fuzzy Logic
method for quantifying community resilience. The methodology is based on the
PEOPLES framework, an indicator-based hierarchical framework that defines all
aspects of the community. A fuzzy-based approach is implemented to quantify the
PEOPLES indicators using descriptive knowledge instead of hard data, accounting
also for the uncertainties involved in the analysis. To demonstrate the
applicability of the methodology, data regarding the functionality of the city
San Francisco before and after the Loma Prieta earthquake are used to obtain a
resilience index of the Physical Infrastructure dimension of the PEOPLES
framework. The results show that the methodology can provide good estimates of
community resilience despite the uncertainty of the indicators. Hence, it
serves as a decision-support tool to help decision-makers and stakeholders
assess and improve the resilience of their communities.

EEG-TCFNet in subject-dependent strategy and subject-independent strategy,
respectively. Overall, FNB usage in all three CNN topologies outperformed those
without FNB. In addition, we compared the addition of FNB to other

new levels of robustness and agility over a variety of terrains. However, that
work, and most prior bipedal locomotion work, have not considered locomotion
under a variety of external loads that can significantly influence the overall
system dynamics. In many applications, robots will need to maintain robust
locomotion under a wide range of potential dynamic loads, such as pulling a
cart or carrying a large container of sloshing liquid, ideally without
requiring additional load-sensing capabilities. In this work, we explore the
capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer for
bipedal locomotion under dynamic loads using only proprioceptive feedback. We
show that prior RL policies trained for unloaded locomotion fail for some loads
and that simply training in the context of loads is enough to result in
successful and improved policies. We also compare training specialized policies
for each load versus a single policy for all considered loads and analyze how
the resulting gaits change to accommodate different loads. Finally, we
demonstrate sim-to-real transfer, which is successful but shows a wider
sim-to-real gap than prior unloaded work, which points to interesting future
research.

models have been proposed as a useful addition to the biomolecular simulation

length of trajectories which can be generated for complex systems. Approximate,
but more computationally efficient, generative models can be used in place of
explicit integration of the equations of motion, and can produce meaningful
trajectories at greatly reduced computational cost. Here, we demonstrate a very
simple synMD approach using a fine-grained Markov state model (MSM) with states
mapped to specific atomistic configurations, which provides an exactly solvable
reference. We anticipate this simple approach will enable rapid, effective
testing of enhanced sampling algorithms in highly non-trivial models for both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium problems. We demonstrate the use of a MSM to
generate atomistic synMD trajectories for the fast-folding miniprotein
Trp-cage, at a rate of over 200 milliseconds per day on a standard workstation.
We employ a non-standard clustering for MSM generation that appears to better
preserve kinetic properties at shorter lag times than a conventional MSM. We
also show a parallelizable workflow that backmaps discrete synMD trajectories
to full-coordinate representations at dynamic resolution for efficient

If the surface tension decreases, the settling velocity will decrease due to a

Additionally, increasing the Peclet number (ratio of convection to diffusion on

non-fundamental theory. This is motivated in particular by the fact that
thermodynamics is considered to be a paradigmatic example for a theory that can
be reduced to another one, namely statistical mechanics. For instance, the
statement ""temperature is mean molecular kinetic energy"" has become a textbook
example for a successful reduction, despite the fact that this statement is not
correct for a large variety of systems. In this article, we defend the view
that thermodynamics is a fundamental theory, a position that we justify based
on four case studies from recent physical research. We explain how entropic
gravity (1) and black hole thermodynamics (2) can serve as case studies for the
multiple realizability problem which blocks the reduction of thermodynamics.
Moreover, we discuss the problem of the reducibility of phase transitions and
argue that bifurcation theory (3) allows the modelling of ""phase transitions""
on a thermodynamic level even in finite systems. It is also shown that the
derivation of irreversible transport equations in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism
(4) does not, despite recent claims to the contrary, constitute a reduction of

the use of machine learning to support land-cover measurement and inform
policy-making. However, labelling satellite images is expensive and is
available for only some locations. This prompts the use of transfer learning to
adapt models from data-rich locations to others. Given the potential for
high-impact applications of satellite imagery across geographies, a systematic
assessment of transfer learning implications is warranted. In this work, we
consider the task of land-cover segmentation and study the fairness
implications of transferring models across locations. We leverage a large
satellite image segmentation benchmark with 5987 images from 18 districts (9
urban and 9 rural). Via fairness metrics we quantify disparities in model
performance along two axes -- across urban-rural locations and across
land-cover classes. Findings show that state-of-the-art models have better
overall accuracy in rural areas compared to urban areas, through unsupervised
domain adaptation methods transfer learning better to urban versus rural areas
and enlarge fairness gaps. In analysis of reasons for these findings, we show
that raw satellite images are overall more dissimilar between source and target
districts for rural than for urban locations. This work highlights the need to
conduct fairness analysis for satellite imagery segmentation models and
motivates the development of methods for fair transfer learning in order not to
introduce disparities between places, particularly urban and rural locations.

cost-function is usually modified to include additional terms ensuring
orthogonality with the ground state. This generally requires additional quantum
circuit executions and measurements, increasing algorithmic complexity. Here we
present a design strategy for the variational ansatz which enforces
orthogonality in candidate excited states while still fully exploring the

which trades increasing measurement complexity for increasing circuit
complexity. The latter is anticipated to become preferable as quantum error
mitigation and correction become more refined. We demonstrate our approach with
three distinct ansatze, beginning with a simple single-body example, before
generalizing to accommodate the full Hilbert space spanned by all qubits, and a

segmentation network. However, it struggles with a limited performance compared
to a well-designed Dilated-FCN model for two major problems. First, commonly
used upsampling methods in the decoder such as interpolation and deconvolution
suffer from a local receptive field, unable to encode global contexts. Second,
low-level features may bring noises to the network decoder through skip
connections for the inadequacy of semantic concepts in early encoder layers. To
tackle these challenges, a Global Enhancement Method is proposed to aggregate
global information from high-level feature maps and adaptively distribute them
to different decoder layers, alleviating the shortage of global contexts in the
upsampling process. Besides, a Local Refinement Module is developed by
utilizing the decoder features as the semantic guidance to refine the noisy
encoder features before the fusion of these two (the decoder features and the

different channels. The WDM device has two channels (1470 nm-1523 nm and 1548

noteworthy feature of multi-server jobs is that, they usually request multiple
computing devices simultaneously for their execution. How to schedule
multi-server jobs online with a high system efficiency is a topic of great
concern. Firstly, the scheduling decisions have to satisfy the service locality
constraints. Secondly, the scheduling decisions needs to be made online without
the knowledge of future job arrivals. Thirdly, and most importantly, the actual
service rate experienced by a job is usually in fluctuation because of the
dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and power oversubscription
techniques when multiple types of jobs co-locate. A majority of online
algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees are proposed. However, most
of them require the processing speeds to be knowable, thereby the job
completion times can be exactly calculated. To present a theoretically
guaranteed online scheduling algorithm for multi-server jobs without knowing
actual processing speeds apriori, in this paper, we propose ESDP (Efficient
Sampling-based Dynamic Programming), which learns the distribution of the
fluctuated processing speeds over time and simultaneously seeks to maximize the
cumulative overall utility. The cumulative overall utility is formulated as the
sum of the utilities of successfully serving each multi-server job minus the
penalty on the operating, maintaining, and energy cost. ESDP is proved to have
a polynomial complexity and a logarithmic regret, which is a State-of-the-Art

interaction. Using a head-mounted display (i.e., HoloLens), the mentor can
remotely monitor the procedure streamed from the trainee's operation side. The
mentor can also provide feedback directly with hand gestures, which is in-turn
transmitted to the trainee and viewed in surgical console as guidance. We
comprehensively validate the system on both real surgery stereo videos and
ex-vivo scenarios of common robotic training tasks (i.e., peg-transfer and
suturing). Promising results are demonstrated regarding the fidelity of
streamed scene visualization, the accuracy of feedback with hand interaction,
and the low-latency of each component in the entire remote mentoring system.
This work showcases the feasibility of leveraging AR technology for reliable,
flexible and low-cost solutions to robotic surgical education, and holds great
potential for clinical applications.

algorithms, whose scalable implementation is challenging in experiments. Here,
we propose a protocol of quadratic quantum Fourier transform (QQFT),
considering cold atoms confined in an optical lattice. This QQFT is equivalent
to QFT in the single-particle subspace, and produces a different unitary
operation in the entire Hilbert space. We show this QQFT protocol can be
implemented using programmable laser potential with the
digital-micromirror-device techniques recently developed in the experiments.
The QQFT protocol enables programmable Hamiltonian engineering, and allows
quantum simulations of Hamiltonian models, which are difficult to realize with
conventional approaches. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated by
performing quantum simulations of one-dimensional Poincar\'{e} crystal physics
and two-dimensional topological flat bands, where the QQFT protocol effectively
generates the required long-range tunnelings despite the locality of the cold
atom system. We find the discrete Poincar\'{e} symmetry and topological
properties in the two examples respectively have robustness against a certain
degree of noise that is potentially existent in the experimental realization.
We expect this approach would open up wide opportunities for optical lattice

this paper proposes a complete solution to capture the personalized shape so
that the reconstructed shape looks identical to the corresponding person.
Specifically, given a 2D image as the input, we virtually render the image in
several calibrated views to normalize pose variations while preserving the
original image geometry. A many-to-one hourglass network serves as the
encode-decoder to fuse multiview features and generate vertex displacements as
the fine-grained geometry. Besides, the neural network is trained by directly
optimizing the visual effect, where two 3D shapes are compared by measuring the
similarity between the multiview images rendered from the shapes. Finally, we
propose to generate the ground-truth 3D shapes by registering RGB-D images

adaptively using EMA of the global model, where the decay rate is dynamically

computational challenges arise from the need for repeated evaluations of an
expensive forward model. This renders most Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches
infeasible, since they typically require $O(10^4)$ model runs, or more.
Moreover, the forward model is often given as a black box or is impractical to
differentiate. Therefore derivative-free algorithms are highly desirable. We
propose a framework, which is built on Kalman methodology, to efficiently
perform Bayesian inference in such inverse problems. The basic method is based
on an approximation of the filtering distribution of a novel mean-field
dynamical system into which the inverse problem is embedded as an observation
operator. Theoretical properties of the mean-field model are established for
linear inverse problems, demonstrating that the desired Bayesian posterior is
given by the steady state of the law of the filtering distribution of the
mean-field dynamical system, and proving exponential convergence to it. This
suggests that, for nonlinear problems which are close to Gaussian, sequentially
computing this law provides the basis for efficient iterative methods to
approximate the Bayesian posterior. Ensemble methods are applied to obtain
interacting particle system approximations of the filtering distribution of the
mean-field model; and practical strategies to further reduce the computational
and memory cost of the methodology are presented, including low-rank
approximation and a bi-fidelity approach. The effectiveness of the framework is
demonstrated in several numerical experiments, including proof-of-concept
linear/nonlinear examples and two large-scale applications: learning of
permeability parameters in subsurface flow; and learning subgrid-scale
parameters in a global climate model from time-averaged statistics.

dual-stage design, i.e., coarse stage and fine stage. In coarse stage, five
bands with high similarity in a certain spectral range are divided into three
groups, and the current band is guided to study the potential knowledge. Under
the action of alternative spectral fusion mechanism, the coarse SR image is
super-resolved in band-by-band. In order to build model from a global
perspective, an enhanced back-projection method via spectral angle constraint
is developed in fine stage to learn the content of spatial-spectral

demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coarse stage and fine stage.

environmental, but also economic, with degradation recognised as a key cause of
reduced agricultural productivity and rural poverty in the developing world.
The degradation literature typically emphasises common property or open access
natural resources, and how perverse incentives or missing institutions lead
optimising private actors to degrade them. By contrast, the present paper
considers degradation occurring on private farms in peasant communities. This
is a critical yet delicate issue, given the poverty of such areas and questions
about the role of farmers in either degrading or regenerating rural lands. The
paper examines natural resource management by peasant farmers in Tanzania. Its
key concern is how the local knowledge informing their management decisions
adapts to challenges associated with environmental degradation and market
liberalisation. Given their poverty, this question could have direct
implications for the capacity of households to meet their livelihood needs.
Based on fresh empirical data, the paper finds that differential farmer
knowledge helps explain the large differences in how households respond to the
degradation challenge. The implication is that some farmers adapt more
effectively to emerging challenges than others, despite all being rational,
optimising agents who follow the strategies they deem best. The paper thus
provides a critique of local knowledge, implying that some farmers experience
adaptation slippages while others race ahead with effective adaptations. The
paper speaks to the chronic poverty that plagues many rural communities in the
developing world. It helps explain the failure of proven sustainable
agriculture technologies to disseminate readily beyond early innovators. Its
key policy implication is to inform improved capacity building for such
communities.

noises in implicit feedback. On one hand, the user may exit immediately after
clicking the news as he dislikes the news content, leaving the noise in his
positive implicit feedback; on the other hand, the user may be recommended
multiple interesting news at the same time and only click one of them,
producing the noise in his negative implicit feedback. Opposite implicit
feedback could construct more integrated user preferences and help each other
to minimize the noise influence. Previous works on news recommendation only
used positive implicit feedback and suffered from the noise impact. In this
paper, we propose a denoising neural network for news recommendation with
positive and negative implicit feedback, named DRPN. DRPN utilizes both
feedback for recommendation with a module to denoise both positive and negative

  with Adversarial Learning",,,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Intersections are quite challenging among various driving scenes wherein the
interaction of signal lights and distinct traffic actors poses great difficulty
to learn a wise and robust driving policy. Current research rarely considers
the diversity of intersections and stochastic behaviors of traffic
participants. For practical applications, the randomness usually leads to some
devastating events, which should be the focus of autonomous driving. This paper
introduces an adversarial learning paradigm to boost the intelligence and
robustness of driving policy for signalized intersections with dense traffic
flow. Firstly, we design a static path planner which is capable of generating
trackable candidate paths for multiple intersections with diversified topology.
Next, a constrained optimal control problem (COCP) is built based on these
candidate paths wherein the bounded uncertainty of dynamic models is considered
to capture the randomness of driving environment. We propose adversarial policy
gradient (APG) to solve the COCP wherein the adversarial policy is introduced
to provide disturbances by seeking the most severe uncertainty while the
driving policy learns to handle this situation by competition. Finally, a
comprehensive system is established to conduct training and testing wherein the
perception module is introduced and the human experience is incorporated to
solve the yellow light dilemma. Experiments indicate that the trained policy
can handle the signal lights flexibly meanwhile realizing the smooth and
efficient passing with a humanoid paradigm. Besides, APG enables a large-margin
improvement of the resistance to the abnormal behaviors and thus ensures a high
safety level for the autonomous vehicle.

that are embedded in discs. On the other hand, the core-accretion theory
suggests that there could be a large population of embedded low-mass young
planets at the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) contraction phase. We adopt both 1-D
models and 3-D simulations to calculate the envelopes around low-mass cores
(several to tens of $M_{\oplus}$) with different luminosities, and derive their
thermal fluxes at radio wavelengths. We find that, when the background disc is
optically thin at radio wavelengths, radio observations can see through the
disc and probe the denser envelope within the planet's Hill sphere. When the
optically thin disc is observed with the resolution reaching one disc scale
height, the radio thermal flux from the planetary envelope around a 10
M$_{\oplus}$ core is more than 10 % higher than the flux from the background
disc. The emitting region can be extended and elongated. Finally, our model
suggests that the au-scale clump at 52 au in the TW Hydrae disc revealed by
ALMA is consistent with the envelope of an embedded 10-20 $M_{\oplus}$ planet,
which can explain the detected flux, the spectral index dip, and the tentative
spirals. The observation is also consistent with the planet undergoing pebble
accretion. Future ALMA and ngVLA observations may directly reveal more such
low-mass planets, enabling us to study core growth and even reconstruct the

and day to day variations of area and average photon fluxes of the near

analyzing data of 2001-2008, we find that variations of average area (A),
photon flux (F), radiative energy (E) and temperature (T) of coronal holes are
independent of latitude. Whereas inferred strength of magnetic field structure
of the coronal holes is dependent on the latitudes and varies from low near the
equator to high near both the poles. Typical average values of estimated
physical parameters are: $A \sim 3.8(\pm0.5)\times10^{20}~cm^{2}, F \sim
2.3(\pm0.2)\times10^{13}~photons\;cm^{-2}\;sec^{-1}, E \sim 2.32(\pm0.5)\times

Average strength of magnetic field structure of coronal hole at the corona is
estimated to be $\sim$ $0.08 \pm 0.02$ Gauss. If coronal holes are anchored in
the convection zone, one would expect they should rotate differentially. Hence,
thermal wind balance and isorotation of coronal holes with the solar plasma
implies the temperature difference between the equator and both the poles.
Contrary to this fact, variation of thermal structure of near equatorial
coronal holes is independent of latitude leading to a conclusion that coronal
holes must rotate rigidly that are likely to be anchored initially below the
tachocline confirming our previous study (ApJ, 763, 137, 2013).

trajectory of the abstract shape parameters, the proposed framework synthesizes
a control law that steers the swarm to track the desired formation using the

generate a suitable local reference trajectory that the robot controller tracks

sample images from a large pool of unlabeled images and generates pseudo-labels
for the sampled images. These sampled images with their pseudo-labels are added
to the training set to update the segmentation and representation learning
modules iteratively. To analyze the effectiveness of our technique, we
construct a large geographically marked dataset of temporary slums. This
dataset constitutes more than 200 potential temporary slum locations (2.28
square kilometers) found by sieving sixty-eight thousand images from 12
metropolitan cities of Pakistan covering 8000 square kilometers. Furthermore,
our proposed method outperforms several competitive semi-supervised semantic

relationships between objects, thereby reducing the object attention bias. In
particular, we use the DOA graph to perform unbiased adaptive object attention

the raw images, respectively. To distinguish features in different branches, a
concise adaptive branch energy distribution (ABED) method is proposed. We

electrons. In presence of a finite magnetic field (or Berry curvature) this
electric field has a transverse component. These are known as Seebeck and
Nernst coefficients. As Callen argued, back in 1948, the Seebeck effect
quantifies the entropy carried by a flow of charged particles in absence of
thermal gradient. Similarly, the Nernst conductivity, $\alpha_{xy}$, quantifies
the entropy carried by a flow of magnetic flux in absence of thermal gradient.
The present paper summarizes a picture in which the rough amplitude of the
thermoelectric response is given by fundamental units and material-dependent
length scales. Therefore, knowledge of material-dependent length scales allows
predicting the amplitude of the signal measured by experiments. Specifically,
the Nernst conductivity scales with the square of the mean-free-path in metals.
Its anomalous component in magnets scales with the square of the fictitious
magnetic length. Ephemeral Cooper pairs in the normal state of a superconductor
generate a signal, which scales with the square of the superconducting
coherence length and smoothly evolves to the signal produced by mobile vortices
below the critical temperature.

spiking neurons described by a generalization of the LIFAT (leaky
integrate-and-fire neuron with adaptive threshold) model and a simple spike
timing dependent synaptic plasticity model (a generalization of
dopamine-modulated plasticity). My concept is based on very general assumptions
about RL task characteristics and has no visible limitations on its
applicability. To test it, I selected a simple but non-trivial task of training
the network to keep a chaotically moving light spot in the view field of an

boundary, the velocities of all skyrmion bags with different $Q$ are same. This
can be attributed to the same value of $u/\eta_{xx}$, where the $u$ and
$\eta_{xx}$ are the terms related to the magnetization distribution of skyrmion
bag. In addition, we theoretically derived the dynamics of skyrmion bags in the
two cases using the Thiele approach and discussed the scope of Thiele equation.
Within a certain range, the simulation results are in good agreement with the
analytically calculated results. Our findings provide an alternative way to
manipulate the racetrack memory based on the skyrmion bags.

remarkable Raman enhancement factors (EFs) with ~105 owing to efficient

the Raman EF of WN nanocavity chips could be greatly improved to 1.29 * 107,

Optimization (PTO) algorithm which plans a path-tree in belief-space. A
path-tree is a tree-like motion with branching points where the robot receives
an observation leading to a belief-state update. The robot takes different

steps. First, a rapidly-exploring random graph (RRG) on the state space is
grown. Second, the RRG is expanded to a belief-space graph by querying the
observation model. In a third step, dynamic programming is performed on the
belief-space graph to extract a path-tree. The resulting path-tree combines
exploration with exploitation i.e. it balances the need for gaining knowledge
about the environment with the need for reaching the goal. We demonstrate the
algorithm capabilities on navigation and mobile manipulation tasks, and show
its advantage over a baseline using a task and motion planning approach (TAMP)

algorithms, as well as a careful combination with existing distributed
frameworks. On smooth and nonconvex landscapes, DES has a convergence rate
competitive to existing zeroth-order methods, and can exploit the sparsity, if

Gaussian probability model to guide the search and avoids the numerical issue
resulted from finite-difference techniques in existing zeroth-order methods.
The DES method is also fully adaptive to the problem landscape, as its
convergence is guaranteed with any parameter setting. We further propose two

neighborhood heterogeneity provides a natural criterion to learn data-dependent

effect of data heterogeneity on the convergence time of D-SGD. For the
important case of classification with label skew, we formulate the problem of
learning such a good topology as a tractable optimization problem that we solve
with a Frank-Wolfe algorithm. As illustrated over a set of simulated and

sparse topology that balances the convergence speed and the per-iteration

reduce the dynamics to a general oscillator equation in which the forcing is a
complex valued function $F(p,{\psi})\propto{\epsilon}_1
(p)cos({\psi})+i{\epsilon}_2 (p)sin({\psi})$. Assuming that the oscillator is
strongly nonisochronous and/or forced by a power forcing
$(|{\nu}{\epsilon}_1/{\epsilon}_2 |\gg 1)$, we show that the parameters
${\epsilon}_{1,2} (p)$ govern the main bifurcation features of the Arnold
tongue diagram : (i) the locking range asymmetry is mainly controlled by
$d{\epsilon}_1 (p)/dp$, (ii) the Taken-Bogdanov bifurcation occurs for a power
threshold depending on ${\epsilon}_{1,2} (p)$ and (iii) the frequency
hysteretic range is related to the transient regime through the resonant
frequency at zero mismatch frequency. Then, the model is compared with the
macrospin simulation for driving amplitudes as large as $10^0-10^3 A/m$ for the
magnetic field and $10^{10}-10^{12} A/m^2$ for the current density. As
predicted by the model, the forcing configuration (nature of the driving
signal, applied direction, the harmonic orders) affects substantially the
oscillator dynamic. However, some discrepancies are observed. In particular,
the prediction of the frequency and power locking range boundaries may be
misestimated if the hysteretic boundaries are of same magnitude order.
Moreover, the misestimation can be of two different types according if the
bifurcation is Saddle node or Taken Bogdanov. These effects are a further
manifestation of the complexity of the dynamics in nonisochronous
auto-oscillators.

Novel image synthesis techniques, so-called foveated rendering, exploit this
observation and reduce the spatial resolution of synthesized images for the
periphery, avoiding the synthesis of high-spatial-frequency details that are
costly to generate but not perceived by a viewer. However, contemporary
techniques do not make a clear distinction between the range of spatial
frequencies that must be reproduced and those that can be omitted. For a given
eccentricity, there is a range of frequencies that are detectable but not
resolvable. While the accurate reproduction of these frequencies is not
required, an observer can detect their absence if completely omitted. We use
this observation to improve the performance of existing foveated rendering
techniques. We demonstrate that this specific range of frequencies can be
efficiently replaced with procedural noise whose parameters are carefully tuned
to image content and human perception. Consequently, these frequencies do not
have to be synthesized during rendering, allowing more aggressive foveation,
and they can be replaced by noise generated in a less expensive post-processing
step, leading to improved performance of the rendering system. Our main
contribution is a perceptually-inspired technique for deriving the parameters
of the noise required for the enhancement and its calibration. The method
operates on rendering output and runs at rates exceeding 200FPS at 4K
resolution, making it suitable for integration with real-time foveated
rendering systems for VR and AR devices. We validate our results and compare

distributions of the classifier. We find that OOD samples expose their
aberration starting from the first layer, while the abnormalities of Adv
samples do not emerge until the deeper layers of the model. We also illustrate
that the models' output probabilities for Adv samples tend to be more
unconfident. Based on our observations, we propose a simple method to separate
ID, OOD, and Adv samples using the hidden representations and output
probabilities of the model. On multiple combinations of ID, OOD datasets, and
Adv attacks, our proposed method shows exceptional results on distinguishing
ID, OOD, and Adv samples.

  spindle",,,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  During cell division, the spindle generates force to move chromosomes. In
mammals, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers) attach to and
segregate chromosomes. To do so, k-fibers must be robustly anchored to the
dynamic spindle. We previously developed microneedle manipulation to
mechanically challenge k-fiber anchorage, and observed spatially distinct
response features revealing the presence of heterogeneous anchorage (Suresh et
al. 2020). How anchorage is precisely spatially regulated, and what forces are
necessary and sufficient to recapitulate the k-fiber's response to force remain
unclear. Here, we develop a coarse-grained k-fiber model and combine with
manipulation experiments to infer underlying anchorage using shape analysis. By
systematically testing different anchorage schemes, we find that forces solely
at k-fiber ends are sufficient to recapitulate unmanipulated k-fiber shapes,
but not manipulated ones for which lateral anchorage over a 3 $\mu$m length
scale near chromosomes is also essential. Such anchorage robustly preserves
k-fiber orientation near chromosomes while allowing pivoting around poles.
Anchorage over a shorter length scale cannot robustly restrict pivoting near
chromosomes, while anchorage throughout the spindle obstructs pivoting at
poles. Together, this work reveals how spatially regulated anchorage gives rise
to spatially distinct mechanics in the mammalian spindle, which we propose are
key for function.

mechanisms are first designed for HSI and LiDAR data in order to learn
spectral- and spatial-enhanced feature representations, and to represent

behind in terms of image quality. More sophisticated solutions, based on
statistical modelling, careful parameter tuning, or through increased model
complexity, can be sensitive to different environments. Recently, deep learning

conventional techniques for mechanical enhancement resulted in a mild

this work, a Double-Drawing technique is developed to deform continuously grown
CNTFs and rearrange the constituent CNTs in both mesoscale and nanoscale

more versatile than comparable carbon fiber, Zylon, Dyneema, and Kevlar.

us to extend the Hamiltonian of the standard balance model. Random networks
with tunable parameters are suitable for better understanding the behavior of
standard balance as an underlying dynamics. Moreover, the standard balance
model in its original form does not allow preserving tensed triads in the
network. Therefore, the thermal behavior of the balance model has been
investigated on a fully connected signed network recently. It has been shown
that the model undergoes an abrupt phase transition with temperature.
Considering these two issues together, we examine the thermal behavior of the
structural balance model defined on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. We
provide a Mean-Field solution for the model. We observe a first-order phase
transition with temperature, for both the sparse and densely connected
networks. We detect two transition temperatures, $T_{cold}$ and $T_{hot}$,
characterizing a hysteresis loop. We find that with increasing the network
sparsity, both $T_{cold}$ and $T_{hot}$ decrease. But the slope of decreasing
$T_{hot}$ with sparsity is larger than the slope of decreasing $T_{cold}$.
Hence, the hysteresis region gets narrower, until, in a certain sparsity, it
disappears. We provide a phase diagram in the temperature-tie density plane to
observe the meta-stable/coexistence region behavior more accurately. Then we
justify our Mean-Field results with a series of Monte-Carlo simulations.

traditionally tedious due to the large number of required measurements that may
take several days to complete. The recent demonstration of sparse sampling for
QPI imaging showed how the effective measurement time could be fundamentally
reduced by only sampling a small and random subset of the total LDOS. However,
the amount of required sub-sampling to faithfully recover the QPI image
remained a recurring question. Here we introduce an adaptive sparse sampling
(ASS) approach in which we gradually accumulate sparsely sampled LDOS
measurements until a desired quality level is achieved via compressive sensing
recovery. The iteratively measured random subset of the LDOS can be interleaved
with regular topographic images that are used for image registry and drift
correction. These reference topographies also allow to resume interrupted
measurements to further improve the QPI quality. Our ASS approach is a
convenient extension to quasiparticle interference imaging that should remove
further hesitation in the implementation of sparse sampling mapping schemes.

applications show characteristic double-hump absorption features peaking in the
green and deep-red spectral range. These signatures result from coupling of an
intramolecular Frenkel exciton and an intermolecular charge transfer exciton.
Crystalline, textured thin films suitable for polarized spectro-microscopy have
been obtained for compounds with n-hexyl (nHSQ) and n-octyl (nOSQ) terminal
alkyl chains. The here released triclinic crystal structure of nOSQ is similar
to the known nHSQ crystal structure. Consequently, crystallites from both
compounds show equal pronounced linear dichroism with two distinct polarization
directions. The difference in polarization angle between the two absorbance
maxima cannot be derived by spatial considerations from the crystal structure
alone but requires theoretical modeling. Using an essential state model, the
observed polarization behavior was discovered to depend on the relative
contributions of the intramolecular Frenkel exciton and the intermolecular
charge transfer exciton to the total transition dipole moment. For both nHSQ
and nOSQ, the contribution of the charge transfer exciton to the total
transition dipole moment was found to be small compared to the intramolecular
Frenkel exciton. Therefore, the net transition dipole moment is largely
determined by the intramolecular component resulting in a relatively small
mutual difference between the polarization angles. Ultimately, the molecular
alignment within the micro-textured crystallites can be deduced and, with that,
the excited state transitions can be spotted.

local antimagic labeling if for any two adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, they
have different vertex sums, i.e., $w(u) \neq w(v)$, where the vertex sum $w(u)
= \sum_{e \in E(u)} f(e)$, and $E(u)$ is the set of edges incident to $u$. Thus
any local antimagic labeling induces a proper vertex coloring of $G$ where the
vertex $v$ is assigned the color (vertex sum) $w(v)$. The local antimagic
chromatic number $\chi_{la}(G)$ is the minimum number of colors taken over all
colorings induced by local antimagic labelings of $G$. It was conjectured
\cite{Aru-Wang} that for every tree $T$ the local antimagic chromatic number
$l+ 1 \leq \chi_{la} ( T )\leq l+2$, where $l$ is the number of leaves of $T$.
In this article we verify the above conjecture for complete full $t$-ary trees,
for $t \geq 2$. A complete full $t$-ary tree is a rooted tree in which all
nodes have exactly $t$ children except leaves and every leaf is of the same
depth. In particular we obtain that the exact value for the local antimagic
chromatic number of all complete full $t$-ary trees is $ l+1$ for odd $t$.

to generate contrastive explanations upon task failures. The explanation is
based on setting the failure state in contrast with the closest state that
would have allowed for a successful execution. This state is found through
breadth-first search and is based on success predictions from the learned

reach a sim2real accuracy of 70% and 72%, respectively. We finally show that

Gardner et al (2021) argue that the compositional nature of language implies
that \emph{all} correlations between labels and individual ""input features"" are
spurious. This paper analyzes this proposal in the context of a toy example,
demonstrating three distinct conditions that can give rise to feature-label
correlations in a simple PCFG. Linking the toy example to a structured causal
model shows that (1) feature-label correlations can arise even when the label
is invariant to interventions on the feature, and (2) feature-label
correlations may be absent even when the label is sensitive to interventions on
the feature. Because input features will be individually correlated with labels
in all but very rare circumstances, domain knowledge must be applied to
identify spurious correlations that pose genuine robustness threats.

recurrent and uncontrollable seizures, which seriously affect the life of
patients. In many cases, electroencephalograms signal can provide important
physiological information about the activity of the human brain which can be
used to diagnose epilepsy. However, visual inspection of a large number of
electroencephalogram signals is very time-consuming and can often lead to
inconsistencies in physicians' diagnoses. Quantification of abnormalities in
brain signals can indicate brain conditions and pathology so the
electroencephalogram (EEG) signal plays a key role in the diagnosis of
epilepsy. In this article, an attempt has been made to create a single
instruction for diagnosing epilepsy, which consists of two steps. In the first
step, a low-pass filter was used to preprocess the data and three separate
mid-pass filters for different frequency bands and a multilayer neural network
were designed. In the second step, the wavelet transform technique was used to
process data. In particular, this paper proposes a multilayer perceptron neural
network classifier for the diagnosis of epilepsy, that requires normal data and
epilepsy data for education, but this classifier can recognize normal
disorders, epilepsy, and even other disorders taught in educational examples.
Also, the value of using electroencephalogram signal has been evaluated in two
ways: using wavelet transform and non-using wavelet transform. Finally, the
evaluation results indicate a relatively uniform impact factor on the use or
non-use of wavelet transform on the improvement of epilepsy data functions, but
in the end, it was shown that the use of perceptron multilayer neural network
can provide a higher accuracy coefficient for experts.

ShorTor uses multi-hop overlay routing, a technique typically employed by
content delivery networks, to influence the route Tor traffic takes across the
internet. ShorTor functions as an overlay on top of onion routing-Tor's
existing routing protocol and is run by Tor relays, making it independent of
the path selection performed by Tor clients. As such, ShorTor reduces latency
while preserving Tor's existing security properties. Specifically, the routes
taken in ShorTor are in no way correlated to either the Tor user or their
destination, including the geographic location of either party. We analyze the
security of ShorTor using the AnoA framework, showing that ShorTor maintains
all of Tor's anonymity guarantees. We augment our theoretical claims with an
empirical analysis. To evaluate ShorTor's performance, we collect a real-world
dataset of over 400,000 latency measurements between the 1,000 most popular Tor
relays, which collectively see the vast majority of Tor traffic. With this
data, we identify pairs of relays that could benefit from ShorTor: that is, two
relays where introducing an additional intermediate network hop results in
lower latency than the direct route between them. We use our measurement
dataset to simulate the impact on end users by applying ShorTor to two million
Tor circuits chosen according to Tor's specification. ShorTor reduces the
latency for the 99th percentile of relay pairs in Tor by 148 ms. Similarly,
ShorTor reduces the latency of Tor circuits by 122 ms at the 99th percentile.
In practice, this translates to ShorTor truncating tail latencies for Tor which
has a direct impact on page load times and, consequently, user experience on
the Tor browser.

simultaneously. In this paper, we design a dynamic self-adaptive threshold

to assess the regression quality of pseudo labels in single-stage detectors, we
propose a module to compute the regression uncertainty of boxes based on

The NPCE is a combination and generalization of both classical linear
programming (LP) and classical input-output (IO) models. In contrast to LP and
IO the NPCE has both production and consumption components. Moreover, the
production cost, the consumption and the factors (resources) availability are
not fixed. Instead they are corespondent functions of the production output,
prices of goods and prices of factors. At the NPCE the total production cost
reaches its minimum, while the total consumption, without factors expences,
reaches its maximum. At the same time the production cost is consistent with
the production output, the consumption is consistent with the prices for goods
and the factors availability is consistent with prices for factors. Finding
NPCE is equivalent to solving a variational inequality (VI) with a particular
nonlinear operator and a simple feasible set. Under natural assumptions on the
production, consumption and factor operators the NPCE exists and it is unique.
Projection on the feasible set {\Omega} is a low cost operation, therefore for
solving the VI we use two projection methods. Each of them requires at each
step few matrix by vector multiplications and allows, along with convergence
and convergence rate, establish complexity bound. The methods decompose the
problem, so both the primal and the dual variables are computed simultaneously.
On the other hand, both methods are pricing mechanisms for establishing NPCE,
which is a generalization of Walras - Wald equilibrium (see [12]) in few

freezes the pre-trained language model and only optimizes a few task-specific
prompts. In this paper, we propose a conditional prompt generation method to
generate prompts for each input instance, referred to as the Instance-Dependent
Prompt Generation (IDPG). Unlike traditional prompt tuning methods that use a
fixed prompt, IDPG introduces a lightweight and trainable component to generate
prompts based on each input sentence. Extensive experiments on ten natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks show that the proposed strategy consistently
outperforms various prompt tuning baselines and is on par with other efficient
transfer learning methods such as Compacter while tuning far fewer model
parameters.

been difficult to model so far. Predicting the aggregation behavior of these

vast design space, inherent variability, and high computational costs

predict the morphology of aggregates self-assembled from sequence-defined

those based on engineered features such as $k$-mer counting, and a
Recurrent-Neural-Network-based regressor performs the best out of nine model

screening of monomer sequences using the regression model to identify
candidates for self-assembly into selected morphologies. Our strategy is shown
to successfully identify multiple suitable sequences in every test we
performed, so we hope the insights gained here can be extended to other
increasingly complex design scenarios in the future, such as the design of
sequences under polydispersity and at varying environmental conditions.

to embrace it. However, it is pointed out that the lack of coherence of certain

kinds : 1) axiomatic thermodynamics; 2) inconsistent solutions of certain
paradoxes; 3) reluctance of physicists to the simplification provided by

didactic way by paying attention to the structure of the theory, what are the
foundations, how ideas articulate, with a peculiar focus on their consistency

takes into account its subjective nature, finally allowing a more intuitive
understanding.

to classical computers, nevertheless they have high error rates. One
significant kind of errors is known as Readout Errors. Current methods, as the
matrix inversion and least-squares, are used to unfold (correct) readout
errors. But these methods present many problems like oscillatory behavior and
unphysical outcomes. In 2020 Benjamin Nachman et al. suggested a technique
currently used in HEP, to correct detector effects. This method is known as the
Iterative Bayesian Unfolding (IBU), and they have proven its effectiveness in
mitigating readout errors, avoiding problems of the mentioned methods.
Therefore, the main objective of our thesis is to mitigate readout noise of
quantum computers, using this powerful unfolding method. For this purpose we
generated a uniform distribution in the Yorktown IBM Q Machine, for 5 Qubits,
in order to unfold it by IBU after being distorted by noise. Then we repeated
the same experiment with a Gaussian distribution. Very satisfactory results and
consistent with those of B. Nachman et al., were obtained. After that, we took
a second purpose to explore unfolding in a larger qubit system, where we
succeed to unfold a uniform distribution for 7 Qubits, distorted by noise from
the Melbourne IBM Q Machine. In this case, the IBU method showed much better
results than other techniques.

for the bow shock is 17+/-1 kpc and for the upstream shock is 10.7+/-0.3 kpc. A
narrow collisionless shock will appear broader in projection if its smooth
shape is warped by local gas motions. We show that both shock widths are
consistent with collisionless shocks blurred by local gas motions of 290+/-30
km/s. The upstream shock forms later on in the merger than the bow shock and is
therefore expected to be significantly narrower. From the electron temperature
profile behind the bow shock, we measure the timescale for the electrons and
ions to come back into thermal equilibrium. We rule out rapid thermal
equilibration of the electrons with the shock-heated ions at the 6 sigma level.
The observed temperature profile instead favours collisional equilibration. For
these cluster merger shocks, which have low sonic Mach numbers and propagate
through a high $\beta$ plasma, we find no evidence for electron heating over
that produced by adiabatic compression. Our findings are expected to be valid
for collisionless shocks with similar parameters in other environments and
support the existing picture from the solar wind and supernova remnants. The
upstream shock is consistent with this result but has a more complex structure,
including a ~2 keV increase in temperature ~50 kpc ahead of the shock.

through observation data and to (2) generate similar swarming behaviour using
the learned model. In particular, a modified version of dynamic mode
decomposition with control, called swarmDMD, is developed and tested on the
canonical Vicsek swarm model. The goal is to use swarmDMD to learn inter-agent
interactions that give rise to the observed swarm behaviour. We show that
swarmDMD can faithfully reconstruct the swarm dynamics, and the model learned
by swarmDMD provides a short prediction window for data extrapolation with a
trade-off between prediction accuracy and prediction horizon. We also provide a
comprehensive analysis on the efficacy of different observation data types on
the modelling, where we find that inter-agent distance yields the most accurate
models. We believe the proposed swarmDMD approach will be useful for studying
multi-agent systems found in biology, physics, and engineering.

  Environments","Accepted at AAAI 2022",,,,"math.OC cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper studies the problem of expected loss minimization given a data
distribution that is dependent on the decision-maker's action and evolves
dynamically in time according to a geometric decay process. Novel algorithms
for both the information setting in which the decision-maker has a first order
gradient oracle and the setting in which they have simply a loss function
oracle are introduced. The algorithms operate on the same underlying principle:
the decision-maker repeatedly deploys a fixed decision over the length of an
epoch, thereby allowing the dynamically changing environment to sufficiently
mix before updating the decision. The iteration complexity in each of the
settings is shown to match existing rates for first and zero order stochastic
gradient methods up to logarithmic factors. The algorithms are evaluated on a
""semi-synthetic"" example using real world data from the SFpark dynamic pricing
pilot study; it is shown that the announced prices result in an improvement for
the institution's objective (target occupancy), while achieving an overall
reduction in parking rates.

  Lorenzi","Active-learning-based non-intrusive Model Order Reduction",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CE cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Model Order Reduction (MOR) technique can provide compact numerical
models for fast simulation. Different from the intrusive MOR methods, the
non-intrusive MOR does not require access to the Full Order Models (FOMs),
especially system matrices. Since the non-intrusive MOR methods strongly rely
on the snapshots of the FOMs, constructing good snapshot sets becomes crucial.
In this work, we propose a new active learning approach with two novelties. A
novel idea with our approach is the use of single-time step snapshots from the
system states taken from an estimation of the reduced-state space. These states
are selected using a greedy strategy supported by an error estimator based
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Additionally, we introduce a use
case-independent validation strategy based on Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning. In this work, we use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to
identify the Reduced Order Model (ROM), however the method could be similarly
applied to other ROM identification methods. The performance of the whole
workflow is tested by a 2-D thermal conduction and a 3-D vacuum furnace model.
With little required user interaction and a training strategy independent to a
specific use case, the proposed method offers a huge potential for industrial
usage to create so-called executable Digital Twins (DTs).

by jointly optimizing the forgetting factor and the sparsity penalty parameter,
we develop the jointly-optimized S-RRLS (JO-S-RRLS) algorithm, which not only
exhibits low misadjustment but also can track well sudden changes of a sparse
system. Simulations in impulsive noise scenarios demonstrate that the proposed
S-RRLS and JO-S-RRLS algorithms outperform existing techniques.

system-on-chips (SoC). Neural architecture search (NAS) comes to the rescue for
efficiently utilizing the high compute throughput offered by these
accelerators. However, existing NAS frameworks have several practical
limitations in scaling to multiple tasks and different target platforms. In
this work, we provide a two-pronged approach to this challenge: (i) a
NAS-enabling infrastructure that decouples model cost evaluation, search space
design, and the NAS algorithm to rapidly target various on-device ML tasks, and
(ii) search spaces crafted from group convolution based inverted bottleneck
(IBN) variants that provide flexible quality/performance trade-offs on ML
accelerators, complementing the existing full and depthwise convolution based
IBNs. Using this approach we target a state-of-the-art mobile platform, Google
Tensor SoC, and demonstrate neural architectures that improve the
quality-performance pareto frontier for various computer vision
(classification, detection, segmentation) as well as natural language
processing tasks.

drawing inspiration from the brain may help to improve current machine learning
algorithms. Contrastive Hebbian Learning (CHL) and Equilibrium Propagation (EP)
are biologically plausible algorithms that update weights using only local
information (without explicitly calculating gradients) and still achieve
performance comparable to conventional backpropagation. In this study, we
augmented CHL and EP with Adjusted Adaptation, inspired by the adaptation
effect observed in neurons, in which a neuron's response to a given stimulus is
adjusted after a short time. We add this adaptation feature to multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.
Surprisingly, adaptation improved the performance of these networks. We discuss
the biological inspiration for this idea and investigate why Neuronal
Adaptation could be an important brain mechanism to improve the stability and
accuracy of learning.

interacting with humans and handling different tasks more efficiently in
future. With advancement in artificial intelligence it can be foreseen that
robots will definitely take over all of the major and minor jobs, will socially
interact with humans and will minimize the burden of human significantly. With
the passage of time humans will forget about their reality and the labour work
they currently do by themselves. That age will be exactly the peak age of
robots and we can call it age of the rise of the robots. With the rise of
robots, they will start taking decision by themselves regarding the human life
and the planet. Human will again start to minimize the influence of robots and
take control of their life with the help of some robots. The WALL-E narrates
such a story of human life dependency on robots in spaceship when earth is
destroyed because of some catastrophe. The clash between human and robots
occurs when humans find the earth is survivable and should go back but robots
do not allow them. With the help of some social robots humans again take
control and take the ship back to earth. The major part of the movie is about
the a lonely robot living on planet earth, the love of two robots, their
interaction. Those two robots help humans to move back to earth.

  Consolidation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)","23 pages",,,,"cs.CE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Soil consolidation is closely related to seepage, stability, and settlement
of geotechnical buildings and foundations, and directly affects the use and
safety of superstructures. Nowadays, the unidirectional consolidation theory of
soils is widely used in certain conditions and approximate calculations. The
multi-directional theory of soil consolidation is more reasonable than the
unidirectional theory in practical applications, but it is much more
complicated in terms of index determination and solution. To address the above
problem, in this paper, we propose a deep learning method using
physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to predict the excess pore water
pressure of two-dimensional soil consolidation. In the proposed method, (1) a
fully connected neural network is constructed, (2) the computational domain,
partial differential equation (PDE), and constraints are defined to generate
data for model training, and (3) the PDE of two-dimensional soil consolidation
and the model of the neural network is connected to reduce the loss of the
model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparison with
the numerical solution of PDE for two-dimensional consolidation. Using this
method, the excess pore water pressure could be predicted simply and
efficiently. In addition, the method was applied to predict the soil excess
pore water pressure in the foundation in a real case at Tianjin port, China.
The proposed deep learning approach can be used to investigate the large and
complex multi-directional soil consolidation.
