temperature, combined with the high-Z metal of a certain thickness, it can
realize the high energy resolution measurement of particles such as X-rays.
X-rays with energies below 10 keV have very weak penetrating ability, so only a
few microns thick of gold or bismuth can obtain quantum efficiency higher than
70\%. Therefore, the entire structure of the TES X-ray detector in this energy
range can be realized in the microfabrication process. However, for X-rays or
gamma rays from 10 keV to 200 keV, sub-millimeter absorber layers are required,
which cannot be realized by microfabrication process. This paper first briefly
introduces a set of TES X-ray detectors and their auxiliary systems built by
ShanghaiTech University, then focus on the introduction of the TES $\gamma$-ray
detector, with absorber based on an sub-millimeter lead-tin alloy sphere. The
detector has a quantum efficiency above 70\% near 100 keV, and an energy
resolution of about 161.5eV@59.5keV.

is due to the interpolation driving the online phase, since it replicates, by

recommendations. However, most existing news recommendation methods only aim to
optimize recommendation accuracy while ignoring diversity. Reranking is a
widely used post-processing technique to promote the diversity of top
recommendation results. However, the recommendation model is not perfect and
errors may be propagated and amplified in a cascaded recommendation algorithm.
In addition, the recommendation model itself is not diversity-aware, making it
difficult to achieve a good tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and
diversity. In this paper, we propose a news recommendation approach named
LeaDivRec, which is a fully learnable model that can generate diversity-aware
news recommendations in an end-to-end manner. Different from existing news
recommendation methods that are usually based on point- or pair-wise ranking,
in LeaDivRec we propose a more effective list-wise news recommendation model.
More specifically, we propose a permutation Transformer to consider the
relatedness between candidate news and meanwhile can learn different
representations for similar candidate news to help improve recommendation
diversity. We also propose an effective list-wise training method to learn
accurate ranking models. In addition, we propose a diversity-aware
regularization method to further encourage the model to make controllable
diversity-aware recommendations. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing recommendation

However, these models can easily inherit the biases related to users' sensitive

respectively, to learn a candidate-aware user embedding that reflects user
interest in candidate news and a candidate-invariant user embedding that
indicates intrinsic user interest. We apply adversarial learning to both of
them to reduce the biases brought by sensitive user attributes. In addition, we
use a KL loss to regularize the attribute labels inferred from the two user

improve the fairness of various single-tower news ranking models with minor

creativity, and a love of learning. And while many school systems increasingly
undercut curiosity by teaching to the test, teachers are increasingly
interested in how to evoke curiosity in their students to prepare them for a
world in which lifelong learning and reskilling will be more and more
important. One aspect of curiosity that has received little attention, however,
is the role of peers in eliciting curiosity. We present what we believe to be
the first theoretical framework that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive
account of curiosity that ties observable behaviors in peers to underlying
curiosity states. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and
interpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors
that fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraging
a longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm a positive
predictive relationship between the latent variables of individual and
interpersonal functions and curiosity, with the interpersonal functions
exercising a comparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral
realizations of these functions are also discovered in a data-driven manner. We
instantiate the proposed theoretical framework in a set of strategies and
tactics that can be incorporated into learning technologies to indicate, evoke,
and scaffold curiosity. This work is a step towards designing learning
technologies that can recognize and evoke moment-by-moment curiosity during
learning in social contexts and towards a more complete multimodal learning
analytics. The underlying rationale is applicable more generally for developing
computer support for other metacognitive and socio-emotional skills.

knowledge complementary to task labels for student teaching. Distilling on
unseen unlabeled data has the potential to enhance the knowledge transfer from

from an ensemble of teacher models on both labeled and unlabeled data. Since
different teachers may have diverse prediction correctness on the same sample,
on labeled data we weight the predictions of different teachers according to
their correctness. In addition, we weight the distillation loss based on the
overall prediction correctness of the teacher ensemble to distill high-quality
knowledge. On unlabeled data, there is no groundtruth to evaluate prediction
correctness. Fortunately, the disagreement among teachers is an indication of
sample hardness, and thereby we weight the distillation loss based on teachers'
disagreement to emphasize knowledge distillation on important samples.

that dememorized equations differ from micro-scale equations and constitute a

restrictive and require time steps that are very small (scales as the inverse
of the contrast). We show that, by appropriately decomposing the space, we can
treat only a few degrees of freedom implicitly and the remaining degrees of

interest due to its advantages of joint optimization and low latency when
compared to traditionally cascaded pipelines. Existing E2E SLU models usually
follow a two-stage configuration where an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
network first predicts a transcript which is then passed to a Natural Language
Understanding (NLU) module through an interface to infer semantic labels, such
as intent and slot tags. This design, however, does not consider the NLU
posterior while making transcript predictions, nor correct the NLU prediction
error immediately by considering the previously predicted word-pieces. In
addition, the NLU model in the two-stage system is not streamable, as it must
wait for the audio segments to complete processing, which ultimately impacts
the latency of the SLU system. In this work, we propose a streamable multi-task
semantic transducer model to address these considerations. Our proposed
architecture predicts ASR and NLU labels auto-regressively and uses a semantic
decoder to ingest both previously predicted word-pieces and slot tags while
aggregating them through a fusion network. Using an industry scale SLU and a

exposure-adaptive novel view synthesis, our method successfully addresses
photometric distortions in outdoor environments that existing photometric-based

improves pose regression accuracy using semi-supervised learning on unlabeled

Synthesizer and DFNet. The former synthesizes novel views compensating for
changes in exposure and the latter regresses camera poses and extracts robust
features that close the domain gap between real images and synthetic ones.
Furthermore, we introduce an online synthetic data generation scheme. We show
that these approaches effectively enhance camera pose estimation both in indoor

outperforming existing single-image APR methods by as much as 56%, comparable
to 3D structure-based methods.

reinforcement learning. Although many auxiliary tasks have been empirically
shown to be effective for accelerating learning on the main task, it is not yet
clear what makes useful auxiliary tasks. Some of the most promising results are
on the pixel control, reward prediction, and the next state prediction
auxiliary tasks; however, the empirical results are mixed, showing substantial
improvements in some cases and marginal improvements in others. Careful
investigations of how auxiliary tasks help the learning of the main task is
necessary. In this paper, we take a step studying the effect of the target
policies on the usefulness of the auxiliary tasks formulated as general value
functions. General value functions consist of three core elements: 1) policy 2)
cumulant 3) continuation function. Our focus on the role of the target policy
of the auxiliary tasks is motivated by the fact that the target policy
determines the behavior about which the agent wants to make a prediction and
the state-action distribution that the agent is trained on, which further
affects the main task learning. Our study provides insights about questions
such as: Does a greedy policy result in bigger improvement gains compared to
other policies? Is it best to set the auxiliary task policy to be the same as
the main task policy? Does the choice of the target policy have a substantial
effect on the achieved performance gain or simple strategies for setting the
policy, such as using a uniformly random policy, work as well? Our empirical
results suggest that: 1) Auxiliary tasks with the greedy policy tend to be
useful. 2) Most policies, including a uniformly random policy, tend to improve
over the baseline. 3) Surprisingly, the main task policy tends to be less
useful compared to other policies.

making problem, we use the world-line concept from Special Relativity as the
inspiration for a novel multi-agent path planning method. We have identified a
particular set of problems that have so far been overlooked by previous works.
We present our solution for the global path planning problem for each agent and
ensure smooth local collision avoidance for each pair of agents in the scene.
We accomplish this by modeling the trajectories of the agents through 2D space
and time as curves in 3D. Global path planning is solved using a modified
Djikstra's algorithm to ensure that initial trajectories for agents do not
intersect. We then solve for smooth local trajectories using a quasi-Newton
interior point solver, providing the trajectory curves with a radius to turn
them into rods. Subsequently, resolving collision of the rods ensures that no
two agents are in the same spatial position at the same time. This space-time
formulation allows us to simulate previously ignored phenomena such as highly
asymmetric interactions in very constrained environments. It also provides a
solution for scenes with unnaturally symmetric agent alignments without the
need for jittering agent positions or velocities.

unlabeled source and target data and then fine-tunes on labeled source data, is
competitive with strong UDA methods. However, we find that contrastive
pre-training does not learn domain-invariant features, diverging from
conventional UDA intuitions. We show theoretically that contrastive
pre-training can learn features that vary subtantially across domains but still
generalize to the target domain, by disentangling domain and class information.
Our results suggest that domain invariance is not necessary for UDA. We

Ergodicity is a necessary condition for linear causal modeling. Long-range
correlations and non-Gaussianity characterizing various biological and

for causal modeling. Long-range correlations (e.g., in fractional Gaussian
noise, a.k.a. ""pink noise"") break ergodicity--in raw Gaussian series, as well
as in some but not all standard descriptors of variability, i.e., in
coefficient of variation (CV) and root mean square (RMS) but not standard
deviation (SD) for longer series. The present work demonstrates that
progressive increases in non-Gaussianity conspire with long-range correlations
to break ergodicity in SD for all series lengths. Meanwhile, explicitly
encoding the cascade dynamics that can generate temporally correlated
non-Gaussian noise offers a way to restore ergodicity to our causal models.
Specifically, fractal and multifractal properties encode both scale-invariant
power-law correlations and their variety, respectively, both of which features
index the underlying cascade parameters. Fractal and multifractal descriptors
of long-range correlated non-Gaussian processes show no ergodicity breaking and
hence, provide a more stable explanation for the long-range correlated
non-Gaussian form of biological and psychological processes. Fractal and
multifractal descriptors offer a path to restoring ergodicity to causal

an optical circuit in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient

better understand how users obtain new insights when executing a VA workflow.
Yet, the gap between theoretical models and the practice of knowledge
generation analysis is wide, and theory has mainly been used as a baseline for
practical works. Also, two concepts are typically ambiguous and intermixed when
analyzing VA workflows: the temporal aspect, which indicates sequences of
events, and the atemporal aspect, which indicates the workflow's state-space,
which is the set of all states of the VA tool and its user occupied during a VA
workflow. Also, the lack of guidelines on how to analyze the recorded user's
knowledge-gathering process when compared to the VA workflow itself is
apparent. We bridge this gap by presenting Visual Analytics Knowledge Graph

allow for the coordination of models across a collection of agents, and without
the need to exchange raw data. Instead, agents compute model updates locally
based on their available data, and subsequently share the update model with a
parameter server or their peers. This is followed by an aggregation step, which
traditionally takes the form of a (weighted) average. Distributed learning
schemes based on averaging are known to be susceptible to outliers. A single
malicious agent is able to drive an averaging-based distributed learning
algorithm to an arbitrarily poor model. This has motivated the development of
robust aggregation schemes, which are based on variations of the median and
trimmed mean. While such procedures ensure robustness to outliers and malicious
behavior, they come at the cost of significantly reduced sample efficiency.
This means that current robust aggregation schemes require significantly higher
agent participation rates to achieve a given level of performance than their
mean-based counterparts in non-contaminated settings. In this work we remedy
this drawback by developing statistically efficient and robust aggregation
schemes for distributed learning.

in which time rather than space is the emergent dimension. By making a
sufficiently large T^2-deformation of a Euclidean CFT, we define a holographic
theory that lives on Cauchy slices of the Lorentzian bulk. (More generally, for
an arbitrary Hamiltonian constraint equation that closes, we show how to obtain
it by an irrelevant deformation from a CFT with suitable anomalies.) The
partition function of this theory defines a natural map between the bulk
canonical quantum gravity theory Hilbert space, and the Hilbert space of the
usual (undeformed) boundary CFT. We argue for the equivalence of the ADM and
CFT Hamiltonians. We also explain how bulk unitarity emerges naturally, even
though the boundary theory is not reflection-positive. This allows us to
reformulate the holographic principle in the language of Wheeler-DeWitt
canonical quantum gravity.
  Along the way, we outline a procedure for obtaining a bulk Hilbert space from
the gravitational path integral with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Following
previous conjectures, we postulate that this finite-cutoff gravitational path
integral agrees with the T^2-deformed theory living on an arbitrary boundary
manifold -- at least near the semiclassical regime. However, the T^2-deformed
theory may be easier to UV complete, in which case it would be natural to take
it as the definition of nonperturbative quantum gravity.

dynamics in the large population limit assumes that a Poisson process (or
clock) inherent to each agent determines when the agent can revise its
strategy. Hence, such an approach presupposes exponentially distributed
inter-revision intervals, and is inadequate for cases where each strategy
entails a sequence of sub-tasks (sub-strategies) that must be completed before
a new revision time occurs. This article proposes a methodology for such cases
under the premise that a sub-strategy's duration is exponentially-distributed,
leading to Erlang distributed inter-revision intervals. We assume that a
so-called pairwise-comparison protocol captures the agents' revision
preferences to render our analysis concrete. The presence of sub-strategies
brings on additional dynamics that is incompatible with existing models and
results. Our main contributions are twofold, both derived for a deterministic
approximation valid for large populations. We prove convergence of the
population's state to the Nash equilibrium set when a potential game generates
a payoff for the strategies. We use system-theoretic passivity to determine
conditions under which this convergence is guaranteed for contractive games.

sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread
adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality
tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable

we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are
parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware
utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms).
Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch

of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense

reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In

universal traversal, where the goal is to traverse every gadget at least once,
for DAG gadgets, one-state gadgets, and reversible deterministic gadgets. We
also study the complexity of reconfiguration, where the goal is to bring the
system of gadgets to a specified state, proving many cases PSPACE-complete, and
showing in some cases that reconfiguration can be strictly harder than
reachability (where the goal is for the agent to reach a specified location),

optical system in terms of the electromagnetic Green's tensor for an aplanatic
lens. The collective internal atomic dynamics is analyzed via a Lindblad master

interactions between atoms. We thus demonstrate that the resonant dipole-dipole
coupling between the atoms can be enhanced in the focal plane of the lens, and
the lens-modified energy exchange between the atoms can create a mutual
trapping potential. Our work opens new avenues for expanding dipole-dipole
interactions to macroscopic scales and the experimental platforms to study
them.

framework that generates complex musical samples conditioned on dance videos.
Our proposed framework takes dance video frames and human body motions as
input, and learns to generate music samples that plausibly accompany the
corresponding input. Unlike most existing conditional music generation works
that generate specific types of mono-instrumental sounds using symbolic audio
representations (e.g., MIDI), and that usually rely on pre-defined musical
synthesizers, in this work we generate dance music in complex styles (e.g.,
pop, breaking, etc.) by employing a Vector Quantized (VQ) audio representation,
and leverage both its generality and high abstraction capacity of its symbolic
and continuous counterparts. By performing an extensive set of experiments on
multiple datasets, and following a comprehensive evaluation protocol, we assess
the generative qualities of our proposal against alternatives. The attained
quantitative results, which measure the music consistency, beats
correspondence, and music diversity, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method. Last but not least, we curate a challenging dance-music
dataset of in-the-wild TikTok videos, which we use to further demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in real-world applications -- and which we hope to
serve as a starting point for relevant future research.

partially. We discuss how quantum fluctuations may significantly change the

two miscible components, forming a pseudo-scalar bubble condensate with
enhanced quantum fluctuations (quantum bubble), immersed in a bath provided by
a third component, with which they are immiscible. We show that in such a
peculiar effective binary mixture, quantum fluctuations change the equilibrium
of pressures that define the bubble volume and modify as well the criterion for
buoyancy. Once buoyancy sets in, in contrast to the mean-field case, quantum
fluctuations may place the bubble at an intermediate position between the
center and the surface. At the surface, the quantum bubble may transition into
a floating self-bound droplet.

numerically. We provide an approximation algorithm using conditional generative
adversarial networks (GANs) in combination with signatures, an object from
rough path theory. The signature of a sufficiently smooth path determines the
path completely. As a result, in some cases, GANs based on signatures have been
shown to efficiently approximate the law of a stochastic process. For our
algorithm we extend this method to sample from the conditional law, given
noisy, partial observation. Our generator is constructed using neural
differential equations (NDEs), relying on their universal approximator
property. We show well-posedness in providing a rigorous mathematical
framework. Numerical results show the efficiency of our algorithm.

based on certain forms of Siamese networks. Such networks are conceptually
symmetric with two parallel encoders, but often practically asymmetric as
numerous mechanisms are devised to break the symmetry. In this work, we conduct
a formal study on the importance of asymmetry by explicitly distinguishing the
two encoders within the network -- one produces source encodings and the other
targets. Our key insight is keeping a relatively lower variance in target than
source generally benefits learning. This is empirically justified by our
results from five case studies covering different variance-oriented designs,
and is aligned with our preliminary theoretical analysis on the baseline.
Moreover, we find the improvements from asymmetric designs generalize well to
longer training schedules, multiple other frameworks and newer backbones.
Finally, the combined effect of several asymmetric designs achieves a
state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet linear probing and competitive results on
downstream transfer. We hope our exploration will inspire more research in
exploiting asymmetry for Siamese representation learning.

flavor mesons in large (Au-Au, Xe-Xe, Pb-Pb) and small ($d$-Au, $p$-Pb, O-O)

initial-state parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter. In the final state,
hard partons undergo collisional energy loss and branching that was recently
derived using Soft-Collinear-Effective-Theory with Glauber Gluon (SCET$_{\rm

fragmentation functions dominates the nuclear correction. As the system size
decreases, we find that cold nuclear matter effects, collisional energy loss,
and QGP-induced radiations can become equally important. A systematic scan over
the medium size and mass/flavor dependence of $R_{AA}$ provides the opportunity
to separate these individual contributions and identify QGP signatures in small

evolution, regulating both stellar feedback and star formation. Their
properties can be studied with low-frequency radio continuum observations, free
from thermal contamination. Aims. We define a sample of 76 nearby (< 30 Mpc)
galaxies, with rich ancillary data in the radio continuum and infrared from the
CHANG-ES and KINGFISH surveys, which will be observed with the LOFAR Two-metre
Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz. Methods. We present maps for 45 of them as part
of the LoTSS data release 2 (LoTSS-DR2), where we measure integrated flux
densities and study integrated and spatially resolved radio spectral indices.
We investigate the radio-SFR relation, using star-formation rates (SFR) from
total infrared and H $\alpha$ + 24-$\mu$m emission. Results. The radio-SFR
relation at 144 MHz is clearly super-linear with $L_{144} \propto
SFR^{1.4-1.5}$. The mean integrated radio spectral index between 144 and
$\approx$1400 MHz is $\langle \alpha\rangle = -0.56 \pm 0.14$, in agreement
with the injection spectral index for cosmic ray electrons (CRE). However, the
radio spectral index maps show a variation of spectral indices with flatter
spectra associated with star-forming regions and steeper spectra in galaxy
outskirts and, in particular, in extra-planar regions. We found that galaxies
with high star-formation rates (SFR) have steeper radio spectra; we find
similar correlations with galaxy size, mass, and rotation speed. Conclusions.
Galaxies that are larger and more massive are better electron calorimeters,
meaning that the CRE lose a higher fraction of their energy within the
galaxies. This explains the super-linear radio-SFR relation, with more massive,
star-forming galaxies being radio bright. We propose a semi-calorimetric
radio-SFR relation, which employs the galaxy mass as a proxy for the
calorimetric efficiency.

motivate a correlation of the spatial morphology of the signal with the
distribution of stellar mass in M31. However, a robust determination of the
best theory for the observed excess emission is very challenging due to large
uncertainties in the astrophysical gamma-ray foreground model. Here we perform
a spectro-morphological analysis of the M31 gamma-ray excess using
state-of-the-art templates for the distribution of stellar mass in M31 and
novel astrophysical foreground models for its sky region. We construct maps for
the old stellar populations of M31 based on observational data from the PAndAS
survey and carefully remove the foreground stars. We also produce improved
astrophysical foreground models by using novel image inpainting techniques
based on machine learning methods. We find that our stellar maps, taken as a
proxy for the location of a putative population of millisecond pulsars in the
bulge of M31, reach a statistical significance of $5.4\sigma$, making them as
strongly favoured as the simple phenomenological models usually considered in
the literature, e.g., a disk-like template with uniform brightness. Our
detection of the stellar templates is robust to generous variations of the
astrophysical foreground model. Once the stellar templates are included in the
astrophysical model, we show that the dark matter annihilation interpretation
of the signal is unwarranted. Using the results of a binary population
synthesis model we demonstrate that a population of about one million
unresolved MSPs could naturally explain the observed gamma-ray luminosity per
stellar mass, energy spectrum, and stellar bulge-to-disk flux ratio.

This is most likely gas blown into the halo by star formation. Our maps go down
to a $3\sigma$ column density level of $5\times10^{18} cm^{-2}$ . We model the
HI distribution using tilted-ring fitting techniques and find a warp on the
galaxy's approaching and receding sides. The HI in the northern side of the
galaxy appears to be suppressed. This may be the result of ionisation by the
starburst activity in the galaxy, as suggested by a previous study. The origin
of the warp is unclear but could be due to past interactions or ram pressure
stripping. Broad, asymmetric HI absorption lines extending beyond the HI
emission velocity channels are present towards the nuclear region of NGC 4945.
Such broad lines suggest the existence of a nuclear ring moving at a high
circular velocity. This is supported by the clear rotation patterns in the HI
absorption velocity field. The asymmetry of the absorption spectra can be
caused by outflows or inflows of gas in the nuclear region of NGC 4945. The
continuum map shows small extensions on both sides of the galaxy's major axis
that might be signs of outflows resulting from the starburst activity.

out-of-equilibrium critical fluctuations described in concert with the
hydrodynamic evolution of the droplet of QGP by extended hydrodynamics, known
as Hydro+, with the subsequent kinetic description in terms of observable
hadrons. We introduce a critical scalar isoscalar field sigma whose
fluctuations cause correlations between observed hadrons due to the couplings
of the sigma field to the hadrons via their masses. We match the QGP
fluctuations obtained by solving the Hydro+ equations describing the evolution
of critical fluctuations before freeze-out to the correlations of the sigma
field. In turn, these are imprinted onto correlations and fluctuations in the
multiplicity of hadrons, most importantly protons, after freeze-out via the
generalization of the familiar half-century-old Cooper-Frye freeze-out
prescription which we introduce. The proposed framework allows us to study the
effects of critical slowing down and the consequent deviation of the observable
predictions from equilibrium expectations quantitatively. We also quantify the
suppression of cumulants due to conservation of baryon number. We demonstrate

efficient grain growth and can allow fast formation of planetesimals and
planets, before disks dissipate. Vertical settling and dust trapping in
pressure maxima are two mechanisms allowing dust to concentrate in
geometrically thin and high density regions. In this work, we aim to study
these mechanisms in the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTC2D
J163131.2-242627 (Oph163131, i~84deg). We present new high angular resolution
continuum and 12CO ALMA observations of Oph163131. The gas emission appears
significantly more extended in the vertical and radial direction compared to
the dust emission, consistent with vertical settling and possibly radial drift.
In addition, the new continuum observations reveal two clear rings. The outer
ring, located at ~100 au, is well resolved in the observations, which allows us
to put stringent constraints on the vertical extent of millimeter dust
particles. We model the disk using radiative transfer and find that the scale
height of millimeter sized grains is 0.5au or less at 100au from the central
star. This value is about one order of magnitude smaller than the scale height
of smaller micron-sized dust grains constrained by previous modeling, which
implies that efficient settling of the large grains is occurring in the disk.
When adopting a parametric dust settling prescription, we find that the
observations are consistent with a turbulent viscosity coefficient of about
alpha<=10^-5 at 100au. Finally, we find that the thin dust scale height

quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions is a long-standing
question that has not yet received a definitive answer from experiments. In
particular, the relative sizes of the modification of quark and gluon jets
differ between theoretical models. Therefore, a fully data-driven technique is
crucial for an unbiased extraction of the quark and gluon jet spectra and
substructure. We perform a proof-of-concept study based on proton-proton and
heavy-ion collision events from the \textsc{Pyquen} generator with statistics
accessible in Run 4 of the Large Hadron Collider. We use a statistical
technique called topic modeling to separate quark and gluon contributions to
jet observables. We demonstrate that jet substructure observables, such as the
jet shape and jet fragmentation function, can be extracted using this
data-driven method. These values can then be used to obtain the modification of
quark and gluon jet substructures in the QGP. We also perform the topic
separation on smeared input data to demonstrate that the approach is robust to
fluctuations arising from a QGP background. These results suggest the potential
for an experimental determination of quark and gluon jet spectra and their
substructure.

  the equilibration postulate",,,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Almost every quantum system interacts with a large environment, so the exact
quantum mechanical description of its evolution is impossible. One has to
resort to approximate description, usually in the form of a master equation.
There are at least two basic requirements for such a description: first, it
should preserve the positivity of probabilities; second, it should correctly
describe the equilibration process for systems coupled to a single thermal
bath. Existing two widespread descriptions of evolution fail to satisfy at
least one of those conditions. The so-called Davies master equation, while
preserving the positivity of probabilities, fails to describe thermalization
properly. On the other hand, the Bloch-Redfield master equation violates the
first condition, but it correctly describes equilibration, at least for
off-diagonal elements for several important scenarios. However, is it possible
to have a description of open system dynamics that would share both features?
In this paper, we partially resolve this problem in the weak-coupling limit:
(i) We provide a general form of the proper thermal equilibrium state (the
so-called mean-force state) for an arbitrary open system. (ii) We provide the
solution for the steady-state coherences for a whole class of master equations,
and in particular, we show that the solution coincides with the mean-force
Hamiltonian for the Bloch-Redfield equation. (iii) We consider the cumulant
equation, which is explicitly completely positive, and we show that its
steady-state coherences are the same as one of the Bloch-Redfield dynamics (and
the mean-force state accordingly). (iv) We solve the correction to the diagonal
part of the stationary state for a two-level system both for the Bloch-Redfield
and cumulant equation, showing that the solution of the cumulant is very close
to the mean-force state, whereas the Bloch-Redfield differs significantly.

multiple tendon-sheath mechanism (TSM). To motorize the existing TSM-based ICE
catheter, the actuators interface with the outer handle knobs to manipulate
four internal tendons. However, in practice, the actuators are located at a
sterile, safe place far away from the ICE handle. Thus, to interface with
knobs, there exist multiple coupled gear structures between two, leading to a
highly nonlinear behavior (e.g. various slack, elasticity) alongside hysteresis
phenomena in TSM.
  Since ICE catheters are designed for single use, the expensive actuators need
to be located in a safe place so as to be reusable. Moreover, these actuators
should interface as directly as possible with the tendons for accurate tip

streams and machine learning applications. The problem is often addressed by
using streaming algorithms with sublinear space data structures. These
algorithms allow processing of large data while using limited data storage.
Commonly used streaming algorithms, such as count-min sketch, have many
advantages, but do not take into account properties of a data stream for
performance optimization. In the present paper we introduce a novel
double-hashing algorithm that provides flexibility to optimize streaming
algorithms depending on the properties of a given stream. In the double-hashing
approach, first a standard streaming algorithm is employed to obtain an
estimate of the element frequencies. This estimate is derived using a fraction
of the stream and allows identification of the heavy hitters. Next, it uses a
modified hash table where the heavy hitters are mapped into individual buckets
and other stream elements are mapped into the remaining buckets. Finally, the
element frequencies are estimated based on the constructed hash table over the
entire data stream with any streaming algorithm. We demonstrate on both
synthetic data and an internet query log dataset that our approach is capable
of improving frequency estimation due to removing heavy hitters from the
hashing process and, thus, reducing collisions in the hash table. Our approach
avoids employing additional machine learning models to identify heavy hitters
and, thus, reduces algorithm complexity and streamlines implementation.
Moreover, because it is not dependent on specific features of the stream
elements for identifying heavy hitters, it is applicable to a large variety of
streams. In addition, we propose a procedure on how to dynamically adjust the
proposed double-hashing algorithm when frequencies of the elements in a stream
are changing over time.

improvement over prior approaches by incorporating a variable selection prior
for the identification of clinical covariates that drive seizure risk changes

efficient sampler that employs stochastic search and data augmentation
techniques. We evaluate model performance on simulated seizure count data. We
then demonstrate the clinical utility of the proposed model by analyzing daily

  ASL angiography","36 pages, 9 figures, 6 supplementary figures",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: Dynamic angiography using arterial spin labeling (ASL) can provide
detailed hemodynamic information. However, the long time-resolved readouts
require small flip angles to preserve ASL signal for later timepoints, limiting
SNR. By using time-encoded ASL to generate temporal information, the readout
can be shortened. Here, the improvements in SNR from using larger flip angles,
made possible by the shorter readout, are quantitatively investigated.
  Methods: The SNR of a conventional (sequential) protocol with 9 readouts and
a 4-by-3 time-encoded protocol with 3 readouts (giving 9 matched timepoints)
were directly compared using simulations and in vivo data. Both protocols were
compared using readouts with constant (CFA) and variable flip angles (VFA),
where the VFA scheme was designed to produce a consistent ASL signal across
readouts. Optimization of the background suppression to minimize physiological
noise across readouts was also explored.
  Results: The time-encoded protocol increased in vivo SNR by 103% and 96% when
using CFAs or VFAs, respectively. Use of VFAs improved SNR compared to CFAs by
25% and 21% for the sequential and time-encoded protocols, respectively. The
VFA scheme also removed signal discontinuities in the time-encoded data.
Preliminary data suggest optimizing the background suppression could improve in
vivo SNR by a further 16%.
  Conclusion: Time-encoding can be used to generate additional temporal
information in ASL angiography. This enables the use of larger flip angles
which can double the SNR compared to a non-time-encoded protocol. The shortened
time-encoded readout can also lead to improved background suppression, reducing
physiological noise and further improving SNR.

risk of collision and protect the LEO environment, the space robotics ADR
concept has been continuously developed for over a decade to chase, capture,
and deorbit space debris. This paper presents the designed small satellite with
dual robotic manipulators. The small satellite is designed based on CubeSat
standards, which uses commercially available products in the market. In this
paper, an approach is detailed for designing the controlled chase and deorbit
maneuver for a small satellite equipped with an RCS thruster. The maneuvers are
comprised of two phases, a. bringing the chaser satellite to the debris orbit
and accelerating it to close proximity of 1m to the debris object by using the
low thrust RCS thruster, and b. Once captured, controlled deorbiting it to 250
km of altitude. A Hohmann transfer concept is used to move our chaser satellite
from the lower orbit to the debris orbit by two impulsive burns. A number of
the scenarios are simulated, where one or more orbital elements are adjusted.
For more than one orbital elements adjustment, the DAG law and the Q law are
utilized. These laws synthesize the three direction thrusts to the single
thrust force for the controlled maneuver. The $\Delta$V requirement at each
maneuver is determined by using the performance parameters of the RCS thruster
intended for a small satellite. The results show that, for long term simulation
of a chaser satellite maneuver to debris object, an optimum DAG law is most
suitable than the Q law, as it can handle the singularity behavior of the
orbital elements caused due by adjustment of one or more elements more
efficiently.

one covers the spin space with sets, each of which is centered at a
magnetization vector $m$ and whose contribution to the partition function is
bounded in terms of the TAP energy at $m$.

red central galaxies are the main contributors to this anisotropy. We also show
that this behaviour does not depend on the group mass or central galaxy

showing that the two-point cross-correlation function is a good tracer of the
galaxy alignments using all galaxies and not only those of the group to which

number and severity of these fires has been rising for many years. Wildfires
pose direct threats to life and property as well as threats through ancillary
effects like reduced air quality. The aim of this thesis is to develop
techniques to help combat the impacts of wildfires by improving wildfire
modeling capabilities by using satellite fire observations. Already much work
has been done in this direction by other researchers. Our work seeks to expand
the body of knowledge using mathematically sound methods to utilize information
about wildfires that considers the uncertainties inherent in the satellite
data.
  In this thesis we explore methods for using satellite data to help initialize
and steer wildfire simulations. In particular, we develop a method for
constructing the history of a fire, a new technique for assimilating wildfire
data, and a method for modifying the behavior of a modeled fire by inferring
information about the fuels in the fire domain. These goals rely on being able
to estimate the time a fire first arrived at every location in a geographic
region of interest. Because detailed knowledge of real wildfires is typically
unavailable, the basic procedure for developing and testing the methods in this
thesis will be to first work with simulated data so that the estimates produced
can be compared with known solutions. The methods thus developed are then
applied to real-world scenarios. Analysis of these scenarios shows that the
work with constructing the history of fires and data assimilation improves
improves fire modeling capabilities. The research is significant because it
gives us a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of using
satellite data to inform wildfire models and it points the way towards new

recently in quantum chemistry. Despite the enormous potential of these methods,
the accurate description of both dynamical and static correlation effects
within a single and in-principle-exact approach remains a challenge. In this
work, we propose an alternative formulation of reduced density-matrix
functional theory (RDMFT) where the (one-electron reduced) density matrix is
mapped onto an ab initio seniority-zero wave function. In this theory, the
exact natural orbitals and their occupancies are determined self-consistently
from an effective seniority-zero calculation. The latter involves a universal
higher-seniority density matrix functional for which an adiabatic connection
(AC) formula is derived and implemented under specific constraints that are
related to the density matrix. The pronounced curvature of the (constrained) AC
integrand, which is numerically observed in prototypical hydrogen chains and
the Helium dimer, indicates that a description of higher-seniority correlations
within second-order perturbation theory is inadequate in this context. Applying
multiple linear interpolations along the AC or connecting second-order
perturbation theory to a full-seniority treatment via Pad\'{e} approximants are
better strategies. Such information is expected to serve as a guide in the
future design of higher-seniority density-matrix functional approximations.

monitor a dynamical process and send measurements to a base station that
performs global monitoring and decision-making. Smart sensors are equipped with
both sensing and computation, and can either send raw measurements or process
them prior to transmission. Constrained agent resources raise a fundamental
latency-accuracy trade-off. On the one hand, raw measurements are inaccurate
but fast to produce. On the other hand, data processing on resource-constrained
platforms generates accurate measurements at the cost of non-negligible
computation latency. Further, if processed data are also compressed, latency
caused by wireless communication might be higher for raw measurements. Hence,
it is challenging to decide when and where sensors in the network should
transmit raw measurements or leverage time-consuming local processing. To
tackle this design problem, we propose a Reinforcement Learning approach to
learn an efficient policy that dynamically decides when measurements are to be
processed at each sensor. Effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated
through a numerical simulation with case study on smart sensing motivated by
the Internet of Drones.

  We formulate a pseudo-regret for this setting that enforces this safety

  We describe doubly optimistic strategies for this scenario, which maintain
optimistic indices for both safety risk and reward. We show that schema based
on both frequentist and Bayesian indices satisfy tight gap-dependent

logarithmically many times in total. This theoretical analysis is complemented

important contributors to the martian dust budget, convective vortices may
serve as probes of the boundary layer, providing clues on convective
instability, boundary layer diurnal evolution, and surface-atmosphere
interactions. Using vortices as boundary layer probes requires a detailed
understanding of the link between their properties and occurrence rates and the
conditions that produce them. Fortunately, the growing cache of data from the

with predictions, we find more vortex encounters during this second half of the

from these vortex encounters, we also use a Gaussian process analysis to
recover contemporaneous temperature signals. By combining these signals with a
long-established thermodynamics model, we estimate heights of the vortices and
find some agreement with previous work and evidence for the diurnal growth and

characteristics. Experiments on seven AMR datasets from a real-world
large-scale AMR simulation demonstrate that our proposed approach can improve
the compression ratio by up to 3.3X under the same data distortion, compared to
the state-of-the-art method. In addition, we leverage the flexibility of our

  Measurements: Extended Version","10 pages, MDM 2022",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Geofences are a fundamental tool of location-based services. A geofence is
usually activated by detecting a location measurement inside the geofence
region. However, location measurements such as GPS often appear sporadically on
smartphones, partly due to weak signal, or privacy preservation, because users
may restrict location sensing, or energy conservation, because sensing
locations can consume a significant amount of energy. These unpredictable, and
sometimes long, gaps between measurements mean that entry into a geofence can
go completely undetected. In this paper we argue that short term location
prediction can help alleviate this problem by computing the probability of
entering a geofence in the future. Complicating this prediction approach is the
fact that another location measurement could appear at any time, making the
prediction redundant and wasteful. Therefore, we develop a framework that
accounts for uncertain location predictions and the possibility of new
measurements to trigger geofence activations. Our framework optimizes over the
benefits and costs of correct and incorrect geofence activations, leading to an
algorithm that reacts intelligently to the uncertainties of future movements
and measurements.

is non-Gaussian. On the one hand, as expected, if the noise is sufficiently
heavy-tailed, the largest peaks of the solution will be taller under
multiplicative than under additive noise. On the other hand, surprisingly, as
soon as the noise has a finite moment of order $\frac2d$, where $d$ is the
spatial dimension, the largest peaks will be of the same order for both
additive and multiplicative noise, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior
of the solution under Gaussian noise. However, in this case, a closer
inspection reveals a second layer of peaks, beneath the largest peaks, that is
exclusive to multiplicative noise and that can be observed by sampling the
solution on the lattice. Finally, we compute the macroscopic Hausdorff and
Minkowski dimensions of the intermittency islands of the solution. Under both
additive and multiplicative noise, if it is not too heavy-tailed, the largest
peaks will be self-similar in terms of their large-scale multifractal behavior.

that contain typos. We show that a small character level perturbation in
queries (as caused by typos) highly impacts the effectiveness of dense
retrievers. We then demonstrate that the root cause of this resides in the
input tokenization strategy employed by BERT. In BERT, tokenization is
performed using the BERT's WordPiece tokenizer and we show that a token with a
typo will significantly change the token distributions obtained after
tokenization. This distribution change translates to changes in the input
embeddings passed to the BERT-based query encoder of dense retrievers. We then
turn our attention to devising dense retriever methods that are robust to such
queries with typos, while still being as performant as previous methods on
queries without typos. For this, we use CharacterBERT as the backbone encoder
and an efficient yet effective training method, called Self-Teaching (ST), that
distills knowledge from queries without typos into the queries with typos.
Experimental results show that CharacterBERT in combination with ST achieves
significantly higher effectiveness on queries with typos compared to previous
methods. Along with these results and the open-sourced implementation of the
methods, we also provide a new passage retrieval dataset consisting of

delineated if for every hereditary closure $\mathcal D$ of a subclass of
$\mathcal C$, it holds that $\mathcal D$ has bounded twin-width if and only if
$\mathcal D$ is monadically dependent. An effective strengthening of
delineation for a class $\mathcal C$ implies that tractable FO model checking
on $\mathcal C$ is perfectly understood: On hereditary closures $\mathcal D$ of
subclasses of $\mathcal C$, FO model checking is fixed-parameter tractable
(FPT) exactly when $\mathcal D$ has bounded twin-width. Ordered graphs
[BGOdMSTT, STOC '22] and permutation graphs [BKTW, JACM '22] are effectively
delineated, while subcubic graphs are not. On the one hand, we prove that
interval graphs, and even, rooted directed path graphs are delineated. On the
other hand, we show that segment graphs, directed path graphs, and visibility
graphs of simple polygons are not delineated. In an effort to draw the
delineation frontier between interval graphs (that are delineated) and
axis-parallel two-lengthed segment graphs (that are not), we investigate the
twin-width of restricted segment intersection classes. It was known that
(triangle-free) pure axis-parallel unit segment graphs have unbounded
twin-width [BGKTW, SODA '21]. We show that $K_{t,t}$-free segment graphs, and
axis-parallel $H_t$-free unit segment graphs have bounded twin-width, where
$H_t$ is the half-graph or ladder of height $t$. In contrast, axis-parallel
$H_4$-free two-lengthed segment graphs have unbounded twin-width. Our new
results, combined with the known FPT algorithm for FO model checking on graphs
given with $O(1)$-sequences, lead to win-win arguments. For instance, we derive
FPT algorithms for $k$-Ladder on visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains, and
$k$-Independent Set on visibility graphs of simple polygons.

applied at prescribed points, yet avoids certain obstacles, with all the

In the case of masonry structures, for instance, this consists in finding a
strut net that supports the forces, is contained within the physical structure,
and avoids regions that may be not accessible due, for instance, to the
presence of holes. We solve such a problem in the two-dimensional case, where
the prescribed forces are applied at the vertices of a convex polygon, and we
treat the cases of both single and multiple obstacles. By approximating the
obstacles by polygonal regions, the task reduces to identifying the feasible
domain in a linear programming problem. For a single obstacle we show how the
region $\Gamma$ available to the obstacle can be enlarged as much as possible
in the sense that there is no other strut net, having a region $\Gamma_1$
available to the obstacle with $\Gamma_1 \subset\Gamma$. The case where some of
the forces are reactive, unprescribed but reacting to the other prescribed
forces, is also treated. It again reduces to identifying the feasible domain in
a linear programming problem. Finally, one may allow a subset of the reactive
forces to each act not at a prescribed point, but rather at any point on a
prescribed line segment. Then the task reduces to identifying the feasible
domain in a quadratic programming problem.

dependence of the output response using an equivalent circuit of the RTD-THz
oscillator. It is shown that there exists an intrinsic cutoff frequency of
modulation in RTD, which is independent of the external circuit that supplies
the modulation signal to the oscillator. This cutoff frequency is determined by
the time constant given by the capacitance of RTD divided by the absolute value
of negative differential conductance minus loss conductance of the oscillator,
and is about 100 GHz for typical RTD-THz oscillators. We also analyze the
effect of external feedback injection on the modulation characteristics. If the
period of the modulation frequency is equal to an integral multiple of the
round-trip time of the feedback, a dip or peak occurs in the modulation
response of the output, depending on whether the THz carrier components in the
output and the feedback are in phase or out of phase. We also discuss the
possibility of increase in cutoff frequency by the feedback with short
round-trip time.

  \int_{G}^{} f \circ \left( \phi_1 * \phi_2 \right) \left( g \right) dg \leq
\int_{\mathbb{R}}^{} f \circ \left( \phi_1^* * \phi_2^* \right) \left( x

\mathrm{supp} \; \phi_2 ) \leq m(G)$ and any convex function $f \colon
\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f(0) = 0$. Here $\phi^*$ is the
rearrangement of $\phi$.
  Let $Y_O(P,G)$ and $Y_R(P,G)$ denote the optimal constants of Young's and the
reverse Young's inequality, respectively, under the assumption $\mu (
\mathrm{supp} \; \phi_1 ) + \mu ( \mathrm{supp} \; \phi_2 ) \leq m(G)$. Then we
have $Y_O(P,G) \leq Y_O(P,\mathbb{R})$ and $Y_R(P,G) \geq Y_R(P,\mathbb{R})$ as
a corollary. Thus, we obtain that $m (G) = \infty$ if and only if $H (p,G) \leq
H (p, \mathbb{R})$ in the case of $p' := p/(p-1) \in 2 \mathbb{Z}$, where $H
(p,G)$ is the optimal constant of the Hausdorff--Young inequality.

buildings, subway systems, etc.) in their daily lives. Therefore, it is
important to develop efficient indoor spatial query algorithms for supporting
various location-based applications. However, indoor spaces differ from outdoor
spaces because users have to follow the indoor floor plan for their movements.
In addition, positioning in indoor environments is mainly based on sensing
devices (e.g., RFID readers) rather than GPS devices. Consequently, we cannot
apply existing spatial query evaluation techniques devised for outdoor
environments for this new challenge. Because Bayesian filtering techniques can
be employed to estimate the state of a system that changes over time using a
sequence of noisy measurements made on the system, in this research, we propose
the Bayesian filtering-based location inference methods as the basis for
evaluating indoor spatial queries with noisy RFID raw data. Furthermore, two
novel models, indoor walking graph model and anchor point indexing model, are
created for tracking object locations in indoor environments. Based on the
inference method and tracking models, we develop innovative indoor range and k
nearest neighbor (kNN) query algorithms. We validate our solution through use
of both synthetic data and real-world data. Our experimental results show that
the proposed algorithms can evaluate indoor spatial queries effectively and

Robotic process automation (RPA) uses software robots to perform some tasks

and steps to automate, especially with RPA. Process mining is seen as one way
to address such difficulty. This paper aims to assess the applicability of
process mining algorithms in accelerating and improving the implementation of
RPA, along with the challenges encountered throughout project lifecycles.
Methodology: A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the
approaches where process mining techniques were used to understand the as-is
processes that can be automated with software robots. Eight databases were used
to identify papers on this topic. Findings: A total of 19 papers, all published
since 2018, were selected from 158 unique candidate papers and then analyzed.
There is an increase in the number of publications in this domain. Originality:
The literature currently lacks a systematic review that covers the intersection
of process mining and robotic process automation. The literature mainly focuses
on the methods to record the events that occur at the level of user
interactions with the application, and on the preprocessing methods that are
needed to discover routines with the steps that can be automated. Several
challenges are faced with preprocessing such event logs, and many lifecycle
steps of automation project are weakly supported by existing approaches.

future behaviors because user preferences often drift over time. Many existing
recommendation algorithms -- including both shallow and deep ones -- often
model such dynamics independently, i.e., user static and dynamic preferences
are not modeled under the same latent space, which makes it difficult to fuse
them for recommendation. This paper considers the problem of embedding a user's
sequential behavior into the latent space of user preferences, namely
translating sequence to preference. To this end, we formulate the sequential
recommendation task as a dictionary learning problem, which learns: 1) a shared
dictionary matrix, each row of which represents a partial signal of user
dynamic preferences shared across users; and 2) a posterior distribution
estimator using a deep autoregressive model integrated with Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU), which can select related rows of the dictionary to represent a
user's dynamic preferences conditioned on his/her past behaviors. Qualitative
studies on the Netflix dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can capture
the user preference drifts over time and quantitative studies on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve higher
accuracy compared with state-of-the-art factorization and neural sequential
recommendation methods. The code is available at

However, most current methods consider each 3D object in the scene as an
independent training sample, while ignoring their inherent geometric relations,
thus inevitably resulting in a lack of leveraging spatial constraints. In this
paper, we propose a novel method that takes all the objects into consideration
and explores their mutual relationships to help better estimate the 3D boxes.
Moreover, since 2D detection is more reliable currently, we also investigate
how to use the detected 2D boxes as guidance to globally constrain the
optimization of the corresponding predicted 3D boxes. To this end, a
differentiable loss function, termed as Homography Loss, is proposed to achieve
the goal, which exploits both 2D and 3D information, aiming at balancing the
positional relationships between different objects by global constraints, so as
to obtain more accurately predicted 3D boxes. Thanks to the concise design, our
loss function is universal and can be plugged into any mature monocular 3D
detector, while significantly boosting the performance over their baseline.
Experiments demonstrate that our method yields the best performance (Nov. 2021)

Weyl semimetal, but there are differing reports for its antiferromagnetic (AFM)
phases. The coupling of bands dominated by pure Sb layers hosting topological
fermions to Mn and Eu magnetic states provides a potential path to tune the
topological properties. We present a detailed analysis of the magnetic
structure on three AFM phases based on single-crystal neutron diffraction,
magnetization, and heat capacity data as well as polycrystalline $^{151}$Eu
M\""ossbauer data. The Mn magnetic sublattice orders into a C-type AFM structure
below $323(1)$~K with the ordered Mn magnetic moment $\mu_{\text{Mn}}$ lying
perpendicular to the layers. AFM ordering of the Eu sublattice occurs below
$23(1)$~K with the ordered Eu magnetic moment $\mu_{\text{Eu}}$ canted away
from the layer normal and $\mu_{\text{Mn}}$ retaining its higher-temperature
order. $\mu_{\text{Eu}}$ is ferromagnetically aligned within each Eu layer but
exhibits a complicated AFM layer stacking. Both of these higher-temperature
phases are described by magnetic space group (MSG)
$Pn^{\prime}m^{\prime}a^{\prime}$ with the chemical and magnetic unit cells

where $\mu_{\text{Mn}}$ remains unchanged but $\mu_{\text{Eu}}$ develops an
additional in-plane canting. This phase has MSG $P11\frac{2_1}{a^{\prime}}$. We
additionally find evidence of short-range magnetic correlations associated with
the Eu between $12~\text{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 30~\text{K}$. Using the
determined magnetic structures, we postulate the signs of nearest-neighbor
intralayer and interlayer exchange constants and the magnetic anisotropy within

each other. But do attribute-specific learned representations of data also
respect the same causal relations? We answer this question in three steps.
First, we introduce NCINet, an approach for observational causal discovery from
high-dimensional data. It is trained purely on synthetically generated
representations and can be applied to real representations, and is specifically
designed to mitigate the domain gap between the two. Second, we apply NCINet to
identify the causal relations between image representations of different pairs
of attributes with known and unknown causal relations between the labels. For
this purpose, we consider image representations learned for predicting
attributes on the 3D Shapes, CelebA, and the CASIA-WebFace datasets, which we
annotate with multiple multi-class attributes. Third, we analyze the effect on
the underlying causal relation between learned representations induced by
various design choices in representation learning. Our experiments indicate
that (1) NCINet significantly outperforms existing observational causal
discovery approaches for estimating the causal relation between pairs of random
samples, both in the presence and absence of an unobserved confounder, (2)
under controlled scenarios, learned representations can indeed satisfy the
underlying causal relations between their respective labels, and (3) the causal
relations are positively correlated with the predictive capability of the
representations.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.CL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs) are assessed mainly in an offline
setting or through human evaluation. The evaluation is often limited to
single-turn or very time-intensive. As an alternative, user simulators that
mimic user behavior allow us to consider a broad set of user goals to generate
human-like conversations for simulated evaluation. Employing existing user
simulators to evaluate TDSs is challenging as user simulators are primarily
designed to optimize dialogue policies for TDSs and have limited evaluation
capabilities. Moreover, the evaluation of user simulators is an open challenge.
In this work, we proposes a metaphorical user simulator for end-to-end TDS
evaluation, where we define a simulator to be metaphorical if it simulates
user's analogical thinking in interactions with systems. We also propose a
tester-based evaluation framework to generate variants, i.e., dialogue systems
with different capabilities. Our user simulator constructs a metaphorical user
model that assists the simulator in reasoning by referring to prior knowledge
when encountering new items. We estimate the quality of simulators by checking
the simulated interactions between simulators and variants. Our experiments are
conducted using three TDS datasets. The metaphorical user simulator
demonstrates better consistency with manual evaluation than an agenda-based
simulator and a seq2seq model on three datasets; our tester framework
demonstrates efficiency, and better generalization and scalability because it
can be adapted for dialogues in multiple domains and for multiple tasks, such
as conversational recommendation and e-commerce dialogues.

data race detection. Less, however, has been known about real-world,
industry-scale deployment, experience, and insights about data races. Golang
(Go for short) is a modern programming language that makes concurrency a
first-class citizen. Go offers both message passing and shared memory for
communicating among concurrent threads. Go is gaining popularity in modern
microservice-based systems. Data races in Go stand in the face of its emerging
popularity.
  In this paper, using our industrial codebase as an example, we demonstrate
that Go developers embrace concurrency and show how the abundance of
concurrency alongside language idioms and nuances make Go programs highly
susceptible to data races. Google's Go distribution ships with a built-in
dynamic data race detector based on ThreadSanitizer. However, dynamic race
detectors pose scalability and flakiness challenges; we discuss various
software engineering trade-offs to make this detector work effectively at
scale. We have deployed this detector in Uber's 46 million lines of Go codebase
hosting 2100 distinct microservices, found over 2000 data races, and fixed over
1000 data races, spanning 790 distinct code patches submitted by 210 unique
developers over a six-month period. Based on a detailed investigation of these
data race patterns in Go, we make seven high-level observations relating to the
complex interplay between the Go language paradigm and data races.

fix transmit power or optimize power by the classic bounding technique.

potential to alleviate the negative impacts of ridesourcing on the environment.
However, most existing studies only explored its theoretical environmental
benefits based on optimization models and simulations. By contrast, this study
aims to reveal the real-world emission reduction of ridesplitting and its
determinants based on the observed data of ridesourcing in Chengdu, China.
Integrating the trip data with the COPERT model, this study calculates the CO2
emissions of shared rides (ridesplitting) and their substituted single rides
(regular ridesourcing) to estimate the CO2 emission reduction of each
ridesplitting trip. The results show that not all ridesplitting trips reduce
emissions from ridesourcing in the real world. The CO2 emission reduction rate
of ridesplitting varies from trip to trip, averaging at 43.15g/km. Then,
interpretable machine learning models, gradient boosting machines, are applied
to explore the relationship between the CO2 emission reduction rate of
ridesplitting and its determinants. Based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) method, the overlap rate and detour rate of shared rides are identified
to be the most important factors that determine the CO2 emission reduction rate
of ridesplitting. Increasing the overlap rate, the number of shared rides,
average speed, and ride distance ratio while decreasing the detour rate, actual
trip distance, and ride distance gap can increase the CO2 emission reduction
rate of ridesplitting. In addition, nonlinear effects and interactions of the
determinants are examined through the partial dependence plots. To sum up, this
study provides a scientific method for the government and ridesourcing
companies to better assess and optimize the environmental benefits of
ridesplitting.

processing involves manipulating pre-shared entanglement by local operations
and classical communication (LOCC). The LOCC round complexity of a given task
describes how many rounds of classical communication are needed to complete the
task. Despite some results separating one-round versus two-round protocols,
very little is known about higher round complexities. In this paper, we revisit
the task of one-shot random-party entanglement distillation as a way to
highlight some interesting features of LOCC round complexity. We first show
that for random-party distillation in three qubits, the number of communication
rounds needed in an optimal protocol depends on the entanglement measure used;
for the same fixed state some entanglement measures need only two rounds to
maximize whereas others need an unbounded number of rounds. In doing so, we
construct a family of LOCC instruments that require an unbounded number of
rounds to implement. We then prove explicit tight lower bounds on the LOCC
round number as a function of distillation success probability. Our

model consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile
and smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size
and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource
consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the
premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even
retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in
practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model
consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network
pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are
not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in
open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and
retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional
aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as
a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic
optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process.
Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of
experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show
that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning
approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy.

theorem of Markov chains}: every ergodic Markov chain has a unique positive
stationary distribution and the chain attains this distribution in the limit
independent of the initial distribution the chain started with. As Markov
chains are stochastic processes, it is natural to use probability based
arguments for proofs. At the same time, the dynamics of a Markov chain is
completely captured by its initial distribution, which is a vector, and its
transition probability matrix. Therefore, arguments based on matrix analysis
and linear algebra can also be used. The proofs discussed below use one or the
other of these two types of arguments, except in one case where the argument is
graph theoretic. Appropriate credits to the various proofs are given in the
main text.
  Our first proof is entirely elementary, and yet the proof is also quite
simple. The proof also suggests a mixing time bound, which we prove, but this
bound in many cases will not be the best bound. One approach in proving the
fundamental theorem breaks the proof in two parts: (i) show the existence of a
unique positive stationary distribution for irreducible Markov chains, and (ii)
assuming that an ergodic chain does have a stationary distribution, show that
the chain will converge in the limit to that distribution irrespective of the
initial distribution. For (i), we survey two proofs, one uses probability
arguments, and the other uses graph theoretic arguments. For (ii), first we
give a coupling based proof (coupling is a probability based technique), the
other uses matrix analysis. Finally, we give a proof of the fundamental theorem
using only linear algebra concepts.

the key factors influencing farmers' participation through an empirical
approach. The paper shows that residents' social pension insurance is facing
problems in the rural areas such as low level of protection and weak management

there is a significant impact on farmers' participation in insurance from
personal characteristics factors such as gender, age, health and (family)
financial factors such as savings, personal income, intergenerational mobility

simulations (LES) have significant potential as an analysis method for natural
ventilation flow, since they can provide an accurate prediction of turbulent
flow at any location in the computational domain. However, the simulations can
be computationally expensive, and few validation and sensitivity studies have
been reported. The objectives of this study are to validate LES of wind-driven
cross-ventilation and to quantify the sensitivity of the solution to the grid
resolution and the inflow boundary conditions. We perform LES for an isolated
building with two openings, using three different grid resolutions and two
different inflow conditions with varying turbulence intensities. Predictions of
the ventilation rate are compared to a reference wind-tunnel experiment
available from literature, and we also quantify the age of air and ventilation
efficiency. The results show that a sufficiently fine grid resolution is needed
to provide accurate predictions of the detailed flow pattern and the age of
air, while the inflow condition is found to affect the standard deviation of
the instantaneous ventilation rate. However, for the cross-ventilation case
modeled in this paper, the prediction of the mean ventilation flow rate is very
robust, showing negligible sensitivity to the grid resolution or the inflow
characteristics.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As an extensive research in the field of natural language processing (NLP),
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is the task of predicting the sentiment
expressed in a text relative to the corresponding aspect. Unfortunately, most
languages lack sufficient annotation resources, thus more and more recent
researchers focus on cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (XABSA).
However, most recent researches only concentrate on cross-lingual data
alignment instead of model alignment. To this end, we propose a novel
framework, CL-XABSA: Contrastive Learning for Cross-lingual Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis. Based on contrastive learning, we close the distance
between samples with the same label in different semantic spaces, thus
achieving a convergence of semantic spaces of different languages.
Specifically, we design two contrastive strategies, token level contrastive
learning of token embeddings (TL-CTE) and sentiment level contrastive learning
of token embeddings (SL-CTE), to regularize the semantic space of source and
target language to be more uniform. Since our framework can receive datasets in
multiple languages during training, our framework can be adapted not only for
XABSA task but also for multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA).
To further improve the performance of our model, we perform knowledge
distillation technology leveraging data from unlabeled target language. In the
distillation XABSA task, we further explore the comparative effectiveness of
different data (source dataset, translated dataset, and code-switched dataset).
The results demonstrate that the proposed method has a certain improvement in
the three tasks of XABSA, distillation XABSA and MABSA. For reproducibility,

  Methods: We have devised a new Virtual extrapolation technique based on the
concept of the probability density functions. Through which we transformed the
original two-parameter list mode data for the coincident photon pairs to a
one-parameter data set. The procedure of random sampling and sampling
distribution - by utilizing some unique properties like a collective difference
and the length compensation - was employed in the data analysis. We studied the
effect of finite timing and energy resolution of detectors on the performance
of the proposed model.
  Results: We determined the frequency of occurrence of the data values
corresponding to real as well as fictitious scattering points { placed on the
arc of a circle drawn with the constant scattering angle - to observe the
highest counts. As expected, we found the highest counts at the location of
real scattering points. The model was evaluated for a uniform attenuating
phantom medium. The results were found impressive for the case of ideal time
and energy information, less so for the cases of finite resolutions.
  Conclusions: Our work outlines a completely new approach; though, a lot more
sophistication is required for its practical utility. Nonetheless, the
technique seems promising in developing a potential approach to improve the
sensitivity of PET imaging.

popular for spoken language understanding (SLU). Through the term end-to-end,
one considers the use of a single model optimized to extract semantic
information directly from the speech signal. A major issue for such models is
the lack of paired audio and textual data with semantic annotation. In this
paper, we propose an approach to build an end-to-end neural model to extract
semantic information in a scenario in which zero paired audio data is
available. Our approach is based on the use of an external model trained to
generate a sequence of vectorial representations from text. These
representations mimic the hidden representations that could be generated inside
an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by processing a speech
signal. An SLU neural module is then trained using these representations as
input and the annotated text as output. Last, the SLU module replaces the top
layers of the ASR model to achieve the construction of the end-to-end model.
Our experiments on named entity recognition, carried out on the QUAERO corpus,
show that this approach is very promising, getting better results than a
comparable cascade approach or than the use of synthetic voices.

Here, we develop a microfounded general threshold model that enables us to
analyze the collective dynamics of individual behavior in the propagation of

search ranking, making it possible to train ranking models with user
interaction data. In real applications, search engines are designed to display
only the most relevant k documents from the retrieved candidate set. The rest
candidates are discarded. As a consequence, position bias and sample selection
bias usually occur simultaneously. Existing unbiased learning to rank
approaches either focus on one type of bias (e.g., position bias) or mitigate
the position bias and sample selection bias with separate components,
overlooking their associations. In this study, we first analyze the mechanisms
and associations of position bias and sample selection bias from the viewpoint
of a causal graph. Based on the analysis, we propose Causal Likelihood
Decomposition (CLD), a unified approach to simultaneously mitigating these two
biases in top-k learning to rank. By decomposing the log-likelihood of the
biased data as an unbiased term that only related to relevance, plus other
terms related to biases, CLD successfully detaches the relevance from position
bias and sample selection bias. An unbiased ranking model can be obtained from
the unbiased term, via maximizing the whole likelihood. An extension to the
pairwise neural ranking is also developed. Advantages of CLD include
theoretical soundness and a unified framework for pointwise and pairwise
unbiased top-k learning to rank. Extensive experimental results verified that
CLD, including its pairwise neural extension, outperformed the baselines by
mitigating both the position bias and the sample selection bias. Empirical
studies also showed that CLD is robust to the variation of bias severity and

algorithm called Recovery and Filtering Vertex Trichotomy Matching (RFVTM) is
proposed to remove outliers and retain sufficient inliers for remote sensing
images. A novel affine invariant descriptor called vertex trichotomy descriptor
is proposed on the basis of that geometrical relations between any of vertices
and lines are preserved after affine transformations, which is constructed by
mapping each vertex into trichotomy sets. The outlier removals in Vertex
Trichotomy Matching (VTM) are implemented by iteratively comparing the
disparity of corresponding vertex trichotomy descriptors. Some inliers
mistakenly validated by a large amount of outliers are removed in VTM
iterations, and several residual outliers close to correct locations cannot be
excluded with the same graph structures. Therefore, a recovery and filtering
strategy is designed to recover some inliers based on identical vertex
trichotomy descriptors and restricted transformation errors. Assisted with the
additional recovered inliers, residual outliers can also be filtered out during
the process of reaching identical graph for the expanded vertex sets.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance on precision and
stability of this algorithm under various conditions, such as remote sensing
images with large transformations, duplicated patterns, or inconsistent

unseen target domains with different data distributions. The problem becomes
even more pronounced when we have no access to target domain samples for
adaptation. In this paper, we address domain generalized semantic segmentation,
where a segmentation model is trained to be domain-invariant without using any
target domain data. Existing approaches to tackle this problem standardize data
into a unified distribution. We argue that while such a standardization
promotes global normalization, the resulting features are not discriminative
enough to get clear segmentation boundaries. To enhance separation between
categories while simultaneously promoting domain invariance, we propose a
framework including two novel modules: Semantic-Aware Normalization (SAN) and
Semantic-Aware Whitening (SAW). Specifically, SAN focuses on category-level
center alignment between features from different image styles, while SAW
enforces distributed alignment for the already center-aligned features. With
the help of SAN and SAW, we encourage both intra-category compactness and
inter-category separability. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on widely-used datasets (i.e. GTAV, SYNTHIA, Cityscapes, Mapillary

four key perspectives: methodological, legal, financial, and technical. Through
the analysis of these four perspectives, the paper provides a comprehensive

energy to magnetic energy. A key question regarding the magnetic field
amplification by turbulence, is, on what scale, $k_{\rm p}$, do magnetic fields
become most concentrated? There has been some disagreement about whether
$k_{\rm p}$ is controlled by the viscous scale, $k_\nu$ (where turbulent
kinetic energy dissipates), or the resistive scale, $k_\eta$ (where magnetic
fields dissipate). Here we use direct numerical simulations of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence to measure characteristic scales in the
kinematic phase of the turbulent dynamo. We run $104$-simulations with
hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers of $10 \leq {\rm Re} \leq 3600$, and magnetic
Reynolds numbers of $270 \leq {\rm Rm} \leq 4000$, to explore the dependence of
$k_{\rm p}$ on $k_\nu$ and $k_\eta$. Using physically motivated models for the
kinetic and magnetic energy spectra, we measure $k_\nu$, $k_\eta$ and $k_{\rm
p}$, making sure that the obtained scales are numerically converged. We
determine the overall dissipation scale relations $k_\nu =
(0.025^{+0.005}_{-0.006})\, k_{\rm turb}\, {\rm Re}^{3/4}$ and $k_\eta =
(0.88^{+0.21}_{-0.23})\, k_\nu\, {\rm Pm}^{1/2}$, where $k_{\rm turb}$ is the
turbulence driving wavenumber and ${\rm Pm}={\rm Rm}/{\rm Re}$ is the magnetic
Prandtl number. We demonstrate that the principle dependence of $k_{\rm p}$ is
on $k_\eta$. For plasmas where ${\rm Re} \gtrsim 100$, we find that $k_{\rm p}
= (1.2_{-0.2}^{+0.2})\, k_\eta$, with the proportionality constant related to
the power-law `Kazantsev' exponent of the magnetic power spectrum. Throughout
this study, we find a dichotomy in the fundamental properties of the dynamo

shifts of solar lines on optical depth. For FGK solar-type stars, curves of
convection velocities as a function of the height in the atmosphere in a large
range of heights from 150 to 700 km were obtained for the first time. All these

granulation velocities through the photosphere slow down to zero. In the lower
chromosphere, red shifts of strong Mg I lines are observed, which indicate a
change in the direction of granulation velocities to the opposite and confirm
the effects of reversal of granulation at heights above 600 km. In cooler K
stars, granulation shifts change with height on average from -50 to 100 m/s,
while they change more sharply in hotter FG stars from -700 to 300 m/s. The
gradient of the line shift curves increases with an increase in the effective
temperature and a decrease in gravity, metallicity, and age of the star. The
connective velocity of the star averaged over all analyzed heights increases
from -90 to -560 m/s from colder to hotter stars. It correlates with
macroturbulence, asymmetry of spectral lines, and the rotation velocity of the

various applications. In this paper, an automatic image registration approach
through line-support region segmentation and geometrical outlier removal
(ALRS-GOR) is proposed. This new approach is designed to address the problems
associated with the registration of images with affine deformations and
inconsistent content, such as remote sensing images with different spectral
content or noise interference, or map images with inconsistent annotations. To
begin with, line-support regions, namely a straight region whose points share
roughly the same image gradient angle, are extracted to address the issues of
inconsistent content existing in images. To alleviate the incompleteness of
line segments, an iterative strategy with multi-resolution is employed to
preserve global structures that are masked at full resolution by image details
or noise. Then, Geometrical Outlier Removal (GOR) is developed to provide
reliable feature point matching, which is based on affineinvariant geometrical
classifications for corresponding matches initialized by SIFT. The candidate
outliers are selected by comparing the disparity of accumulated classifications
among all matches, instead of conventional methods which only rely on local
geometrical relations. Various image sets have been considered in this paper
for the evaluation of the proposed approach, including aerial images with
simulated affine deformations, remote sensing optical and synthetic aperture
radar images taken at different situations (multispectral, multisensor, and
multitemporal), and map images with inconsistent annotations. Experimental
results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the

achieving the tight URLLC radio targets typically results in a capacity loss.
Hence, it is vital for telecom operators to understand the capacity cost of

giant radio galaxy GRG 0503-28 at 70-230 MHz has revealed an
inversion-symmetric bending of its two lobes, while maintaining between their
bent portions a ~200 kpc wide strip-like radio emission gap. This lends the
source the appearance of a mega-sized X-shaped radio galaxy. Identifying the
emission gap with the presence of a gaseous layer, probably a WHIM-filled sheet
in the cosmic web, we suggest that the layer is the most likely cause of the
inversion-symmetric bending of the two radio lobes. Multiple observational
manifestations of such gaseous layers are noted. The two lobes of this GRG,
known to extend very asymmetrically from the host galaxy, are remarkably
symmetric about the emission gap, confirming a curious trend noted earlier for
double radio sources of normal dimensions. The anomalous radio spectral
gradient reported for the northern lobe of this GRG is not substantiated.

task as objects are densely arranged and have arbitrary orientations. The
eight-parameter (coordinates of box vectors) methods in rotated object
detection usually use ln-norm losses (L1 loss, L2 loss, and smooth L1 loss) as
loss functions. As ln-norm losses are mainly based on non-scale-invariant
Minkowski distance, using ln-norm losses will lead to inconsistency with the
detection metric rotational Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and training
instability. To address the problems, we use Mahalanobis distance to calculate
loss between the predicted and the target box vertices' vectors, proposing a
new loss function called Mahalanobis Distance Loss (MDL) for eight-parameter
rotated object detection. As Mahalanobis distance is scale-invariant, MDL is
more consistent with detection metric and more stable during training than
ln-norm losses. To alleviate the problem of boundary discontinuity like all
other eight-parameter methods, we further take the minimum loss value to make
MDL continuous at boundary cases. We achieve state-of-art performance on
DOTA-v1.0 with the proposed method MDL. Furthermore, compared to the experiment
that uses smooth L1 loss, we find that MDL performs better in rotated object
detection.

  Federated Transformer",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid development of cloud manufacturing, industrial production with
edge computing as the core architecture has been greatly developed. However,
edge devices often suffer from abnormalities and failures in industrial
production. Therefore, detecting these abnormal situations timely and
accurately is crucial for cloud manufacturing. As such, a straightforward
solution is that the edge device uploads the data to the cloud for anomaly
detection. However, Industry 4.0 puts forward higher requirements for data
privacy and security so that it is unrealistic to upload data from edge devices
directly to the cloud. Considering the above-mentioned severe challenges, this
paper customizes a weakly-supervised edge computing anomaly detection
framework, i.e., Federated Learning-based Transformer framework
(\textit{FedAnomaly}), to deal with the anomaly detection problem in cloud
manufacturing. Specifically, we introduce federated learning (FL) framework
that allows edge devices to train an anomaly detection model in collaboration
with the cloud without compromising privacy. To boost the privacy performance
of the framework, we add differential privacy noise to the uploaded features.
To further improve the ability of edge devices to extract abnormal features, we
use the Transformer to extract the feature representation of abnormal data. In
this context, we design a novel collaborative learning protocol to promote
efficient collaboration between FL and Transformer. Furthermore, extensive case
studies on four benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time integrating FL
and Transformer to deal with anomaly detection problems in cloud manufacturing.

strongly-coupled Coulomb systems. Unfortunately, the values of the coupling
parameter Gamma_e actually achieved after photoionization of the neutral atoms
remain relatively small because of the considerable intrinsic heating of the
electrons. A conceivable way to get around this obstacle might be to utilize a
spontaneous ionization of the ultracold Rydberg gas, where the initial kinetic
energies could be much less. However, the spontaneous avalanche ionization will
result in a very inhomogeneous distribution (clusterization) of the ions, which
can change the efficiency of the electron relaxation in the vicinity of such
clusters substantially. In the present work, this hypothesis is tested by an
extensive set of numerical simulations. As a result, it is found that despite a
less initial kinetic energy, the subsequent relaxation of the electron
velocities in the clusterized plasmas proceeds much more violently than in the
case of the statistically-uniform ionic distribution. The electron temperature,
firstly, experiences a sharp initial jump (presumably, caused by the
""virialization"" of energies of the charged particles) and, secondly, exhibits a
gradual subsequent increase (presumably, associated with a multi-particle
recombination of the electrons at the ionic clusters). As a possible tool to
reduce the anomalous temperature increase, we considered also a two-step plasma
formation, involving the blockaded Rydberg states. This leads to a suppression
of the clusterization due to a quasi-regular distribution of ions. In such a
case, according to the numerical simulations, the subsequent evolution of the
electron temperature proceeds more gently, approximately with the same rate as
in the statistically-uniform ionic distribution.

far larger than for all other trans-iron elements, therefore it provides a
favorable opportunity for a low background measurement of its spectrum. Since
nickel, as well as iron, is one of the most stable nuclei, the nickel energy
spectrum and its relative abundance with respect to iron provide important
information to estimate the abundances at the cosmic ray source and to model
the Galactic propagation of heavy nuclei. However, only a few direct
measurements of cosmic-ray nickel at energy larger than $ \sim$ 3 GeV/n are
available at present in the literature and they are affected by strong
limitations in both energy reach and statistics. In this paper we present a
measurement of the differential energy spectrum of nickel in the energy range
from 8.8 to 240 GeV/n, carried out with unprecedented precision by the
Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) in operation on the International Space
Station since 2015. The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear
species via a measurement of their electric charge with a dynamic range
extending far beyond iron (up to atomic number $ Z $ = 40). The particle's
energy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter (1.2 proton interaction
lengths, 27 radiation lengths) preceded by a thin imaging section (3 radiation
lengths) providing tracking and energy sampling. This paper follows our
previous measurement of the iron spectrum [O. Adriani et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
126, 241101 (2021).], and it extends our investigation on the energy dependence
of the spectral index of heavy elements. It reports the analysis of nickel data

systematic uncertainties. In the region from 20 to 240 GeV$ /n $ our present

for estimating Lipschitz constants must navigate the trade-off between
scalability and accuracy. In this work, we significantly push the scalability
frontier of a semidefinite programming technique known as LipSDP while
achieving zero accuracy loss. We first show that LipSDP has chordal sparsity,
which allows us to derive a chordally sparse formulation that we call
Chordal-LipSDP. The key benefit is that the main computational bottleneck of
LipSDP, a large semidefinite constraint, is now decomposed into an equivalent
collection of smaller ones: allowing Chordal-LipSDP to outperform LipSDP
particularly as the network depth grows. Moreover, our formulation uses a
tunable sparsity parameter that enables one to gain tighter estimates without
incurring a significant computational cost. We illustrate the scalability of
our approach through extensive numerical experiments.

mass-transfer rates such that the accretion disk around the companion becomes
geometrically thick (or advection-dominated) near the disk outer radius, a
large fraction of the transferred mass will be lost through the outer
Lagrangian (L2) point, as a result of the excessive energy generated by viscous
heating that cannot be efficiently radiated away. A physical model is
constructed where the L2 mass loss fraction is given by the requirement that
the remaining material in the disk has Bernoulli number equal to the L2
potential energy. Our model predicts significant L2 mass loss at mass-transfer
rates exceeding a few times 10^{-4} Msun/yr. An equatorial circum-binary
outflow (CBO) is formed in these systems. Implications for the orbital
evolution and the observational appearance are discussed. In particular, (1)
rapid angular momentum loss from the system tends to shrink the orbit and hence
may increase the formation rate of mergers and gravitational-wave sources; (2)
photons from the hot disk wind are reprocessed by the CBO into longer
wavelength emission in the infrared bands, consistent with Spitzer observations
of some ultra-luminous X-ray sources.

data about their associates, volunteers, clients, etc. However, because most
personal data are sensitive, there is a key challenge in designing
privacy-preserving systems. To tackle privacy concerns, research communities
have proposed different methods to preserve privacy, with Differential privacy
(DP) standing out as a formal definition that allows quantifying the
privacy-utility trade-off. Besides, with the local DP (LDP) model, users can
sanitize their data locally before transmitting it to the server. The objective
of this thesis is thus two-fold: O$_1$) To improve the utility and privacy in
multiple frequency estimates under LDP guarantees, which is fundamental to
statistical learning. And O$_2$) To assess the privacy-utility trade-off of
machine learning (ML) models trained over differentially private data. For
O$_1$, we first tackled the problem from two ""multiple"" perspectives, i.e.,
multiple attributes and multiple collections throughout time, while focusing on
utility. Secondly, we focused our attention on the multiple attributes aspect
only, in which we proposed a solution focusing on privacy while preserving
utility. In both cases, we demonstrate through analytical and experimental
validations the advantages of our proposed solutions over state-of-the-art LDP
protocols. For O$_2$, we empirically evaluated ML-based solutions designed to
solve real-world problems while ensuring DP guarantees. Indeed, we mainly used
the input data perturbation setting from the privacy-preserving ML literature.
This is the situation in which the whole dataset is sanitized independently
and, thus, we implemented LDP algorithms from the perspective of the
centralized data owner. In all cases, we concluded that differentially private
ML models achieve nearly the same utility metrics as non-private ones.

we abstract visualization-related tasks into mathematical operators such as

  management",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data sharing barriers are paramount challenges arising from multicenter
clinical trials where multiple data sources are stored in a distributed fashion
at different local study sites. Merging such data sources into a common data
storage for a centralized statistical analysis requires a data use agreement,
which is often time-consuming. Data merging may become more burdensome when
causal inference is of primary interest because propensity score modeling
involves combining many confounding variables, and systematic incorporation of
this additional modeling in meta-analysis has not been thoroughly investigated
in the literature. We propose a new causal inference framework that avoids the
merging of subject-level raw data from multiple sites but needs only the
sharing of summary statistics. The proposed collaborative inference enjoys
maximal protection of data privacy and minimal sensitivity to unbalanced data
distributions across data sources. We show theoretically and numerically that
the new distributed causal inference approach has little loss of statistical
power compared to the centralized method that requires merging the entire data.
We present large-sample properties and algorithms for the proposed method. We
illustrate its performance by simulation experiments and a real-world data
example on a multicenter clinical trial of basal insulin treatment for reducing
the risk of post-transplantation diabetes among kidney-transplant patients.

the sparse point clouds to build an uncertainty-integrated cuboid
representation of the environment through a data-driven monocular plane
segmentation network. Our chosen world model provides faster distance queries
than the more common voxel-grid representation, and UrbanFly leverages this
capability in two different ways leading to two trajectory optimizers. The
first optimizer uses a gradient-free cross-entropy method to compute
trajectories that minimize collision probability and smoothness cost. Our
second optimizer is a simplified version of the first and uses a sequential
convex programming optimizer initialized based on probabilistic safety
estimates on a set of randomly drawn trajectories. Both our trajectory
optimizers are made computationally tractable and independent of the nature of
underlying uncertainty by embedding the distribution of collision violations in
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Empowered by the algorithmic innovation,
UrbanFly outperforms competing baselines in metrics such as collision rate,
trajectory length, etc., on a high-fidelity AirSim simulator augmented with
synthetic and real-world dataset scenes.

program revision, attempts to statically bound the difference in resource
usage, or cost, between the two program versions. Differential cost analysis is
particularly interesting because of the many compelling applications for it,
such as detecting resource-use regressions at code-review time or proving the
absence of certain side-channel vulnerabilities. One prior approach to
differential cost analysis is to apply relational reasoning that conceptually
constructs a product program on which one can over-approximate the difference
in costs between the two program versions. However, a significant challenge in
any relational approach is effectively aligning the program versions to get
precise results. In this paper, our key insight is that we can avoid the need
for and the limitations of program alignment if, instead, we bound the
difference of two cost-bound summaries rather than directly bounding the
concrete cost difference. In particular, our method computes a threshold value
for the maximal difference in cost between two program versions simultaneously
using two kinds of cost-bound summaries -- a potential function that evaluates
to an upper bound for the cost incurred in the first program and an
anti-potential function that evaluates to a lower bound for the cost incurred
in the second. Our method has a number of desirable properties: it can be fully
automated, it allows optimizing the threshold value on relative cost, it is
suitable for programs that are not syntactically similar, and it supports
non-determinism. We have evaluated an implementation of our approach on a
number of program pairs collected from the literature, and we find that our
method computes tight threshold values on relative cost in most examples.

Weinberg has also produced significant works related to the primordial
gravitational waves with the most important one being the effects of neutrinos
on primordial gravitational waves. With this sort review, our main aim is to
gather all the necessary information for studying the effects of modified
gravity on primordial gravitational waves in a concrete and quantitative way
and in a single paper. After reviewing all the necessary techniques for
extracting the general relativistic energy spectrum, and how to obtain in a WKB
way the modified gravity damping or amplifying factor, we concentrate on
specific forms of modified gravity of interest. The most important parameter
involved for the calculation of the effects of modified gravity on the energy
spectrum is the parameter $a_M$ which we calculate for the cases of $f(R,\phi)$
gravity, Chern-Simons-corrected $f(R,\phi)$ gravity,
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-corrected $f(R,\phi)$ gravity, and higher derivative
extended Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-corrected $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. The exact forms
of $a_M$ is presented explicitly for the first time in the literature. With
regard to Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-corrected $f(R,\phi)$ gravity, and higher
derivative extended Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-corrected $f(R,\phi)$ gravity
theories, we focus on the case that the gravitational wave propagating speed is
equal to that of light's in vacuum. We provide expressions for $a_M$ expressed
in terms of the cosmic time and in terms of the redshift, which can be used
directly for the numerical calculation of the effect of modified gravity on the
primordial gravitational wave energy spectrum.

an intriguing arena for exploring the interplay between Weyl fermions and
correlation physics. One prominent characteristic of the WSM state is the
chiral anomaly, yet the potential effects of electronic correlations on the
chiral anomaly remain unexplored. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the
in-plane magnetotransport properties of single-crystal Mn$_{3+x}$Sn$_{1-x}$
with three different Mn doping levels ($x=0.053$, 0.070, and 0.090). The excess
Mn leads to glassy ferromagnetic behavior and the Kondo effect, aside from
shifting the chemical potential relative to the Weyl nodes. Thus, systematic
tuning of the Mn doping level enables us to study the interplay between the
spin-fluctuation scatterings, the correlation effect, and the chiral anomaly.
We identify negative longitudinal magnetoresistance and planar Hall effect
specific to the chiral anomaly for all three doping levels, indicating that the

eye population's behaviour. We propose an efficient wave-optics-based framework
to model the human eye and a general LF display. With the model, we simulated
the retinal point spread function (PSF) of a point rendered by an LF display at
various depths to characterise the retinal image quality. Additionally,
accommodation responses to rendered LF images were estimated by computing the
visual Strehl ratio based on the optical transfer function (VSOTF) from the
PSFs. We assumed an ideal LF display that had an infinite spatial resolution
and was free from optical aberrations in the simulation. We tested images
rendered at 0--4 dioptres of depths having angular resolutions of up to 4x4
viewpoints within a pupil. The simulation predicted small and constant
accommodation errors, which contradict the findings of previous studies. An
evaluation of the optical resolution of the rendered retinal image suggested a
trade-off between the maximum resolution achievable and the depth range of a
rendered image where in-focus resolution is kept high. The proposed framework
can be used to evaluate the upper bound of the optical performance of an LF
display for realistically aberrated eyes, which may help to find an optimal

These methods modify input samples with prompt sentence pieces, and decode
label tokens to map samples to corresponding labels. However, such a paradigm
is very inefficient for the task of slot tagging. Since slot tagging samples
are multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have to
enumerate all n-grams token spans to find all the possible slots, which greatly
slows down the prediction. To tackle this, we introduce an inverse paradigm for
prompting. Different from the classic prompts mapping tokens to labels, we
reversely predict slot values given slot types. Such inverse prompting only
requires a one-turn prediction for each slot type and greatly speeds up the
prediction. Besides, we propose a novel Iterative Prediction Strategy, from
which the model learns to refine predictions by considering the relations
between different slot types. We find, somewhat surprisingly, the proposed
method not only predicts faster but also significantly improves the effect
(improve over 6.1 F1-scores on 10-shot setting) and achieves new

projection power of the diagonal-matrix step-size for future large scale
applications. We show for a convex problem, our methods can surpass the
convergence rate of Nesterov's accelerated gradient, $1 - \sqrt{\mu/L}$, where
$\mu, L$ are the strongly convex factor of the loss function $F$ and the
Lipschitz constant of $F'$, which is the theoretical limit for the convergence
rate of first-order methods. On the well-known non-convex Rosenbrock function,
our planning methods achieve zero error below 500 gradient evaluations, while
gradient descent takes about 10000 gradient evaluations to reach a $10^{-3}$
accuracy. We discuss the connection of step-size planing to planning in
reinforcement learning, in particular, Dyna architectures.

models for downstream tasks in medical image analysis, e.g., anatomy
segmentation and lesion detection, disease diagnosis and prognosis, and
treatment planning. However, deep learning models are not the sovereign remedy
for medical image analysis when the upstream imaging is not being conducted
properly (with artefacts). This has been manifested in MRI studies, where the
scanning is typically slow, prone to motion artefacts, with a relatively low
signal to noise ratio, and poor spatial and/or temporal resolution. Recent
studies have witnessed substantial growth in the development of deep learning
techniques for propelling fast MRI. This article aims to (1) introduce the deep
learning based data driven techniques for fast MRI including convolutional
neural network and generative adversarial network based methods, (2) survey the
attention and transformer based models for speeding up MRI reconstruction, and
(3) detail the research in coupling physics and data driven models for MRI
acceleration. Finally, we will demonstrate through a few clinical applications,
explain the importance of data harmonisation and explainable models for such
fast MRI techniques in multicentre and multi-scanner studies, and discuss
common pitfalls in current research and recommendations for future research

diagnosis, can also reflect the progress of cognitive impairment, some studies
have begun to apply multi-task learning methods to these two tasks. However,
how to exploit feature correlation remains a challenging problem for these
methods. To comprehensively address this challenge, we propose a MRI-based
multi-task decoupled learning method for AD detection and MMSE score
prediction. First, a multi-task learning network is proposed to implement AD
detection and MMSE score prediction, which exploits feature correlation by
adding three multi-task interaction layers between the backbones of the two
tasks. Each multi-task interaction layer contains two feature decoupling
modules and one feature interaction module. Furthermore, to enhance the
generalization between tasks of the features selected by the feature decoupling
module, we propose the feature consistency loss constrained feature decoupling
module. Finally, in order to exploit the specific distribution information of
MMSE score in different groups, a distribution loss is proposed to further
enhance the model performance. We evaluate our proposed method on multi-site
datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-task decoupled
representation learning method achieves good performance, outperforming
single-task learning and other existing state-of-the-art methods.

an approach to design an energy-efficient EMG-based controller by considering a
kernelized SVM classifier for decoding the information of surface
electromyography (sEMG) signals to infer the underlying muscle movements. In
order to achieve the optimized performance of the EMG-based controller, our
main strategy of classifier design is to reduce the false movements of the
overall system (when the EMG-based controller is at the `Rest' position). To
this end, we have formulated the training algorithm of the proposed supervised
learning system as a general constrained multi-objective optimization problem.
An elitist multi-objective evolutionary algorithm $-$ the non-dominated sorting
genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) has been used to tune the hyperparameters of
SVM. We have presented the experimental results by performing the experiments
on a dataset consisting of the sEMG signals collected from eleven subjects at
five different upper limb positions. Furthermore, the performance of the
trained models based on the two-objective metrics, namely classification
accuracy, and false-negative have been evaluated on two different test sets to
examine the generalization capability of the proposed training approach while
implementing limb-position invariant EMG classification. It is evident from the

the designer in selecting the parameters of the classifier to optimize the

theory of inhomogeneous wave propagation for lossy media into the RA
formulation. We denote the technique as the extended Rytov approximation for
lossy media (xRA-LM). xRA-LM significantly improves upon existing non-iterative

providing a validity range for the permittivity of the objects of up to 50
times greater than RA. We demonstrate the technique by providing results for
predicting wave scattering from piece-wise homogeneous scatterers in a
two-dimensional (2D) region. Numerical investigation of the performance of
xRA-LM for solving direct problem show that xRA-LM can accurately predict wave
scattering by electrically large, low-loss scatterers with high complex

first non-iterative, linear approximate wave scattering model which has a large

be in the range of a few hundreds of femtoseconds. We hope this work provides
us a fresh look at the underlying physics of dioxygen activation reactions
involving more than one spin state.

  Accurate Forecasting",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Forecasting time series data represents an emerging field of research in data
science and knowledge discovery with vast applications ranging from stock price
and energy demand prediction to the early prediction of epidemics. Numerous
statistical and machine learning methods have been proposed in the last five
decades with the demand for high-quality and reliable forecasts. However, in
real-life prediction problems, situations exist in which a model based on one
of the above paradigms is preferable. Therefore, hybrid solutions are needed to
bridge the gap between classical forecasting methods and modern neural network
models. In this context, we introduce a Probabilistic AutoRegressive Neural
Network (PARNN) model that can handle a wide variety of complex time series
data (e.g., nonlinearity, non-seasonal, long-range dependence, and
non-stationarity). The proposed PARNN model is built by creating a fusion of an
integrated moving average and autoregressive neural network to preserve the
explainability, scalability, and ``white-box-like'' prediction behavior of the
individuals. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic stationarity and geometric
ergodicity are obtained by considering the asymptotic behavior of the
associated Markov chain. Unlike advanced deep learning tools, the uncertainty
quantification of the PARNN model based on prediction intervals is obtained.
During computational experiments, PARNN outperforms standard statistical,
machine learning, and deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, NBeats, DeepAR,
etc.) on a diverse collection of real-world datasets from macroeconomics,
tourism, energy, epidemiology, and others for short-term, medium-term, and
long-term forecasting. Multiple comparisons with the best method are carried
out to showcase the superiority of the proposal in comparison with the
state-of-the-art forecasters over different forecast horizons.

important ad operations that can have a significant impact on sales. Such
operational support for ineffective ads has been less explored than that for
effective ads. After pre-analyzing 1,000,000 real-world ad creatives, we found
that there are two types of discontinuation: short-term (i.e., cut-out) and
long-term (i.e., wear-out). In this paper, we propose a practical prediction
framework for the discontinuation of ad creatives with a hazard function-based
loss function inspired by survival analysis. Our framework predicts the
discontinuations with a multi-modal deep neural network that takes as input the
ad creative (e.g., text, categorical, image, numerical features). To improve
the prediction performance for the two different types of discontinuations and
for the ad creatives that contribute to sales, we introduce two new techniques:
(1) a two-term estimation technique with multi-task learning and (2) a
click-through rate-weighting technique for the loss function. We evaluated our
framework using the large-scale ad creative dataset, including 10 billion scale
impressions. In terms of the concordance index (short: 0.896, long: 0.939, and
overall: 0.792), our framework achieved significantly better performance than
the conventional method (0.531). Additionally, we confirmed that our framework
(i) demonstrated the same degree of discontinuation effect as manual operations
for short-term cases, and (ii) accurately predicted the ad discontinuation
order, which is important for long-running ad creatives for long-term cases.

adaptation measures. To understand, predict and improve the energy performance
of cities, the scientific community develops numerical models that describe how
they interact with the atmosphere through heat and moisture exchanges at all
scales. In this review, we present recent advances that are at the origin of
last decade's revolution in computer graphics, and recent breakthroughs in
statistical physics that extend well established path-integral formulations to
non-linear coupled models. We argue that this rare conjunction of scientific
advances in mathematics, physics, computer and engineering sciences opens
promising avenues for urban climate modeling and illustrate this with coupled
heat transfer simulations in complex urban geometries under complex atmospheric
conditions. We highlight the potential of these approaches beyond urban climate
modeling, for the necessary appropriation of the issues at the heart of the
energy transition by societies.
