  first 24 campaigns","Submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome!",,"10.1093/mnras/stad767",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Zwicky Transient Transient Facility (ZTF) performs a systematic neutrino
follow-up program, searching for optical counterparts to high-energy neutrinos
with dedicated Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observations. Since first light in
March 2018, ZTF has taken prompt observations for 24 high-quality neutrino
alerts from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, with a median latency of 12.2
hours from initial neutrino detection. From two of these campaigns, we have
already reported tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg and likely TDE
AT2019fdr as probable counterparts, suggesting that TDEs contribute >7.8% of
the astrophysical neutrino flux. We here present the full results of our
program through to December 2021. No additional candidate neutrino sources were
identified by our program, allowing us to place the first constraints on the
underlying optical luminosity function of astrophysical neutrino sources.
Transients with optical absolutes magnitudes brighter that -21 can contribute
no more than 87% of the total, while transients brighter than -22 can
contribute no more than 58% of the total, neglecting the effect of extinction.
These are the the first observational constraints on the neutrino emission of
bright populations such as superluminous supernovae. None of the neutrinos were
coincident with bright optical AGN flares comparable to that observed for TXS
0506+056/IC170922A, suggesting that most astrophysical neutrinos are not
produced during such optical flares. We highlight the outlook for
electromagnetic neutrino follow-up programs, including the expected potential
for the Rubin Observatory.

filters, require only an incremental filter that supports insertions but not
deletions. However, the design space of incremental filters is missing a ""sweet
spot"" filter that combines space efficiency, fast queries, and fast insertions.
Incremental filters, such as the Bloom and blocked Bloom filter, are not space
efficient. Dynamic filters (i.e., supporting deletions), such as the cuckoo or
vector quotient filter, are space efficient but do not exhibit consistently
fast insertions and queries.
  In this paper, we propose the prefix filter, an incremental filter that
addresses the above challenge: (1) its space (in bits) is similar to
state-of-the-art dynamic filters; (2) query throughput is high and is
comparable to that of the cuckoo filter; and (3) insert throughput is high with
overall build times faster than those of the vector quotient filter and cuckoo
filter by $1.39\times$-$1.46\times$ and $3.2\times$-$3.5\times$, respectively.
We present a rigorous analysis of the prefix filter that holds also for
practical set sizes (i.e., $n=2^{25}$). The analysis deals with the probability
of failure, false positive rate, and probability that an operation requires
accessing more than a single cache line.

insofar. Only spatial interpolation needs to be performed in a centralized way,
while forecasting can be delegated to each sensor. This simplification is
mostly related to the fact that two separate models are involved, one in time
and one in the space domain. Any of the two models can be replaced without
re-estimating the other under a composite likelihood approach. Moreover, the
use of convenient spatial and temporal models eases up computation. We show

imaging, plus optical spectroscopy. The galaxies have undergone a recent
head-on collision, creating a massive gaseous bridge which is known to be
highly turbulent. The bridge contains a complex web of narrow molecular
filaments and clumps. The majority of the filaments are devoid of star
formation, and fall significantly below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship for
normal galaxies, especially for the numerous regions undetected in Pa$\alpha$
emission. Within the loosely connected filaments and clumps of gas we find
regions of high velocity dispersion which appear gravitationally unbound for a
wide range of likely values of $X_{\rm CO}$. Like the ""Firecracker"" region in
the Antennae system, they would require extremely high external dynamical or
thermal pressure to stop them dissipating rapidly on short crossing timescales
of 2-5~Myrs. We suggest that the clouds may be transient structures within a
highly turbulent multi-phase medium which is strongly suppressing star
formation. Despite the overall turbulence in the system, stars seem to have
formed in compact hotspots within a kpc-sized extragalactic HII region, where
the molecular gas has a lower velocity dispersion than elsewhere, and shows
evidence for a collision with an ionized gas cloud. Like the shocked gas in the

formation and evolution of geometric shapes, a phenomenon that may be analyzed
rigorously in suitable scaling regimes. In its sharp-interface limit, the
vectorial Allen-Cahn equation with a potential with $N\geq 3$ distinct minima
has been conjectured to describe the evolution of branched interfaces by
multiphase mean curvature flow.
  In the present work, we give a rigorous proof for this statement in two and
three ambient dimensions and for a suitable class of potentials: As long as a
strong solution to multiphase mean curvature flow exists, solutions to the
vectorial Allen-Cahn equation with well-prepared initial data converge towards
multiphase mean curvature flow in the limit of vanishing interface width
parameter $\varepsilon\searrow 0$. We even establish the rate of convergence
$O(\varepsilon^{1/2})$.
  Our approach is based on the gradient flow structure of the Allen-Cahn
equation and its limiting motion: Building on the recent concept of ""gradient
flow calibrations"" for multiphase mean curvature flow, we introduce a notion of
relative entropy for the vectorial Allen-Cahn equation with multi-well
potential. This enables us to overcome the limitations of other approaches,
e.g. avoiding the need for a stability analysis of the Allen-Cahn operator or
additional convergence hypotheses for the energy at positive times.

send discrete messages through a shared channel with sharply limited
communication. If two processors inadvertently send at the same time, the
messages collide and are not transmitted successfully. An important case is
acknowledgement-based contention resolution, in which processors cannot listen
to the channel at all; all they know is whether or not their own messages have
got through. This situation arises frequently in both networking and cloud
computing. The most common acknowledgement-based protocols in practice are
backoff protocols - variants of binary exponential backoff are used in both
Ethernet and TCP/IP, and both Google Drive and AWS instruct their users to
implement it to handle busy periods.
  In queueing models, where each processor has a queue of messages, stable
backoff protocols are already known (H{\aa}stad et al., SICOMP 1996). In
queue-free models, where each processor has a single message but processors
arrive randomly, it is a long-standing conjecture of Aldous (IEEE Trans. Inf.
Theory 1987) that no stable backoff protocols exist for any positive arrival
rate of processors. Despite exciting recent results for full-sensing protocols
which assume far greater listening capabilities of the processors (see e.g.
Bender et al. STOC 2020 or Chen et al. PODC 2021), this foundational question
remains open; here instability is only known in general when the arrival rate
of processors is at least 0.42 (Goldberg et al. SICOMP 2004). We prove Aldous'

restrict recomputation of network activations only to the nodes affected by

can be converted to efficient, ""asynchronous"" networks at test time. We
thoroughly validate our method on object classification and detection tasks,
where we show an up to a 11-fold reduction in computational complexity (FLOPs),

and self-interested manner to minimize their individual travel costs, which, in
practice, often results in inefficient overall outcomes for society. As a
result, there has been a growing interest in designing road tolling schemes to
cope with these efficiency losses and steer users toward a system-efficient
traffic pattern. However, the efficacy of road tolling schemes often relies on
having access to complete information on users' trip attributes, such as their
origin-destination (O-D) travel information and their values of time, which may
not be available in practice.
  Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose an online learning
approach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous users with
different values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In
particular, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at
each time period solely based on the observed aggregate flows on the roads of
the network without relying on any additional trip attributes of users, thereby
preserving user privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time
of users are drawn i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an
expected regret and road capacity violation of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the
number of periods over which tolls are updated. Our regret guarantee is
relative to an offline oracle that has complete information on users' trip
attributes. We further establish a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound on the regret
of any algorithm, which establishes that our algorithm is optimal up to
constants. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
relative to several benchmarks on a real-world transportation network, thereby
highlighting its practical applicability.

an energy-based model for the approximation of functions by a deep neural
network. This results in a computationally fast filter that takes observations

received. The method is tested on four examples, two linear in one and twenty

central importance among the non-deterministic polynomial (NP) complete
problems, with applications in circuit design, artificial intelligence and
logistics. Even with optimized algorithms, the solution space that needs to be
explored grows exponentially with increasing size of 3-SAT instances. Thus,
large 3-SAT instances require excessive amounts of energy to solve with serial
electronic computers. Network-based biocomputation (NBC) is a multidisciplinary
parallel computation approach with drastically reduced energy consumption. NBC
uses biomolecular motors to propel cytoskeletal filaments through
nanofabricated networks that encode the mathematical problems. By
stochastically exploring possible paths through the networks, the cytoskeletal
filaments find possible solutions to the encoded problem instance. Here we
first report a novel algorithm that converts 3-SAT into NBC-compatible network
format. We demonstrate that this algorithm works in practice, by experimentally
solving four small 3-SAT instances (with up to 3 variables and 5 clauses) using
the actin-myosin biomolecular motor system. This is a key step towards the
broad general applicability of NBC because polynomial conversions to 3-SAT
exist for a wide set of important NP-complete problems.

possess a plethora of unusual electronic properties, but the optical properties
of these materials are less studied. Utilizing $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice
as a prototypical system, where $0\le \alpha \le 1$ is a tunable parameter and
a flat band through the conic intersection of two Dirac cones arises for
$\alpha > 0$, we investigate the conductivity of flat-band Dirac material
systems analytically and numerically. Motivated by the fact that the imaginary
part of the optical conductivity can have significant effects on the optical
response and is an important factor of consideration for developing
$\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice based optical devices, we are led to derive a
complete conductivity formula with both the real and imaginary parts.
Scrutinizing the formula, we uncover two phenomena. First, for the value of
$\alpha$ in some range, two types of optical transitions coexist: one between
the two Dirac cones and another from the flat band to a cone, which generate
multi-frequency transverse electrical propagating waves. Second, for $\alpha=1$
so the quasiparticles become pseudospin-1, the flat-to-cone transition can
result in resonant scattering. These results pave the way to exploiting
$\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice for optical device applications in the terahertz

quantum computing, but entangling spin qubits over micrometer distances remains
a critical challenge. Current prototypical architectures maximize transversal
interactions between qubits and microwave resonators, where the spin state is
flipped by nearly resonant photons. However, these interactions cause
back-action on the qubit, that yield unavoidable residual qubit-qubit couplings
and significantly affect the gate fidelity. Strikingly, residual couplings
vanish when spin-photon interactions are longitudinal and photons couple to the
phase of the qubit. We show that large longitudinal interactions emerge
naturally in state-of-the-art hole spin qubits. These interactions are fully
tunable and can be parametrically modulated by external oscillating electric
fields. We propose realistic protocols to measure these interactions and to
implement fast and high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates. These protocols
work also at high temperatures, paving the way towards the implementation of

emission lines from the Milky Way (MW) hot gas. We report a solar-cycle
($\approx 10$ yr) temporal variation of observed \ion{O}{7} and \ion{O}{8}
emission line measurements in the {\it XMM-Newton} archive, which is tightly
correlated with the solar cycle traced by the sunspot number (SSN). This
temporal variation is expected to be associated with the heliospheric SWCX.
Another observed correlation is that higher solar wind (SW) fluxes lead to
higher O VII or O VIII fluxes, which is due to the magnetospheric SWCX. We
construct an empirical model to reproduce the observed correlation between the
line measurements and the solar activity (i.e., the SW flux and the SSN). With
this model we discovered a lag of $0.91_{-0.22}^{+0.20}$ yr between the O VII
flux and the SSN. This time lag is a combination of the SW transit time within
the heliosphere, the lag of the neutral gas distribution responding to solar
activity, and the intrinsic lag between the SSN and the launch of a high-energy
SW (i.e., $\rm O^{7+}$ and $\rm O^{8+}$). MW O VII and O VIII fluxes have mean
values of 5.4 L.U. and 1.7 L.U., which are reduced by $50\%$ and $30\%$,
compared to studies where the SWCX contamination is not removed. This
correction also changes the determination of the density distribution and the
temperature profile of the MW hot gas.

of photocurrent generation and collection. Here, we directly image the
photocurrent flow inside the type-II Weyl semimetals WTe2 and TaIrTe4 using
high-sensitivity quantum magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy center spins. We
elucidate an unknown mechanism for bulk photocurrent generation termed the
anisotropic photothermoelectric effect (APTE), where unequal thermopowers along
different crystal axes drive intricate circulations of photocurrent around the
photoexcitation. Using simultaneous SPCM and magnetic imaging at the sample's
interior and edges, we visualize how the APTE stimulates the long-range
photocurrent collected in our Weyl semimetal devices through the Shockley-Ramo
theorem. Our results highlight an overlooked, but widely relevant source of
current flow and inspire novel photodetectors using homogeneous materials with

address two key limitations of such representations, in failing to capture
local 3D geometric fine details, and to learn from and generalize to shapes

graph implicit functions with equivariant layers that facilitates modeling fine
local details and guaranteed robustness to various groups of geometric
transformations, through local $k$-NN graph embeddings with sparse point set
observations at multiple resolutions. Our method improves over the existing
rotation-equivariant implicit function from 0.69 to 0.89 (IoU) on the ShapeNet

extended to other types of similarity transformations and generalizes to unseen

systems. If viewed as a graph then, at their most basic level, vertices
correspond to the states of a program and each edge represents a transition

thought to be consistent so that at each state formulas are evaluated as either

  On the other hand, when a structure of this sort - for example a map where

transitions represent information available about different routes - is built
resorting to multiple sources of information, it is common to find inconsistent
or incomplete information regarding what holds at each state, both at the level
of propositional variables and transitions.
  This paper aims at bringing together Belnap's four values, Dynamic Logic and

of interior structures. Despite this staggering diversity, recent analyses have
shown that the densities of planets that orbit a common star exhibit remarkable

begs the question of what physical processes are responsible for the disparate
planetary structures in this system. In this paper, we consider how the

as the host star evolved and the planets' atmospheres were subsequently
affected by the evolving insolation level. We also present a range of allowable

Variational approaches, such as the weak-constraint four-dimensional
variational data assimilation formulation considered in this problem, can
ultimately be interpreted as a minimization problem. One of the main challenges
of such a formulation is the solution of large linear systems of equations
which arise within the inner linear step of the adopted nonlinear solver.
Depending on the adopted approach, these linear algebraic problems amount to
either a saddle point linear system or a symmetric positive definite (SPD) one.
Both formulations can be solved by means of a Krylov method, like GMRES or CG,
that needs to be preconditioned to ensure fast convergence in terms of the
number of iterations. In this paper we illustrate novel, efficient
preconditioning operators which involve the solution of certain Stein matrix
equations. In addition to achieving better computational performance, the
latter machinery allows us to derive tighter bounds for the eigenvalue
distribution of the preconditioned linear system for certain problem settings.
A panel of diverse numerical results displays the effectiveness of the proposed
methodology compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

interacting quantum systems, taking place in colliders, nuclear reactors, or
solids. In a non-linear medium, even a single photon would decay by
down-converting (splitting) into lower frequency photons with the same total
energy, at a rate given by Fermi's Golden Rule. However, the energy
conservation condition cannot be matched precisely if the medium is finite and
only supports quantized modes. In this case, the photon's fate becomes the
long-standing question of many-body localization (MBL), originally formulated
as a gedanken experiment for the lifetime of a single Fermi-liquid
quasiparticle confined to a quantum dot. Here we implement such an experiment
using a superconducting multi-mode cavity, the non-linearity of which was
tailored to strongly violate the photon number conservation. The resulting
interaction attempts to convert a single photon excitation into a shower of
low-energy photons, but fails due to the MBL mechanism, which manifests as a
striking spectral fine structure of multi-particle resonances at the cavity's
standing wave mode frequencies. Each resonance was identified as a many-body
state of radiation composed of photons from a broad frequency range, and not
obeying the Fermi's Golden Rule theory. Our result introduces a new platform to
explore fundamentals of MBL without having to control many atoms or qubits.

transverse-momentum ($p_T$) range of 0.8--10 GeV/$c$. An excess of direct
photons, above prompt-photon production from hard-scattering processes, is
observed for $p_T<6$ GeV/$c$. Nonprompt direct photons are measured by
subtracting the prompt component, which is estimated as $N_{\rm coll}$-scaled
direct photons from $p$$+$$p$ collisions at 200 GeV, from the direct-photon
spectrum. Results are obtained for $0.8<p_T<6.0$ GeV/$c$ and suggest that the
spectrum has an increasing inverse slope from ${\approx}0.2$ to 0.4 GeV/$c$
with increasing $p_T$, which indicates a possible sensitivity of the
measurement to photons from earlier stages of the evolution of the collision.
In addition, like the direct-photon production, the $p_T$-integrated nonprompt
direct-photon yields also follow a power-law scaling behavior as a function of
collision-system size. The exponent, $\alpha$, for the nonprompt component is
found to be consistent with 1.1 with no apparent $p_T$ dependence.

scaling up the size of training datasets and the number of parameters in the
models themselves. Scaling can be complicated due to various factors including
the need to distribute computation on supercomputer clusters (e.g., TPUs),
prevent bottlenecks when infeeding data, and ensure reproducible results. In
this work, we present two software libraries that ease these issues:
$\texttt{t5x}$ simplifies the process of building and training large language
models at scale while maintaining ease of use, and $\texttt{seqio}$ provides a
task-based API for simple creation of fast and reproducible training data and
evaluation pipelines. These open-source libraries have been used to train
models with hundreds of billions of parameters on datasets with multiple
terabytes of training data.
  Along with the libraries, we release configurations and instructions for
T5-like encoder-decoder models as well as GPT-like decoder-only architectures.
  $\texttt{t5x}$ and $\texttt{seqio}$ are open source and available at
https://github.com/google-research/t5x and https://github.com/google/seqio,

  Representations for Text to Speech","Accepted by interspeech 2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, leveraging BERT pre-training to improve the phoneme encoder in text
to speech (TTS) has drawn increasing attention. However, the works apply
pre-training with character-based units to enhance the TTS phoneme encoder,
which is inconsistent with the TTS fine-tuning that takes phonemes as input.
Pre-training only with phonemes as input can alleviate the input mismatch but
lack the ability to model rich representations and semantic information due to
limited phoneme vocabulary. In this paper, we propose MixedPhoneme BERT, a
novel variant of the BERT model that uses mixed phoneme and sup-phoneme
representations to enhance the learning capability. Specifically, we merge the
adjacent phonemes into sup-phonemes and combine the phoneme sequence and the
merged sup-phoneme sequence as the model input, which can enhance the model
capacity to learn rich contextual representations. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed Mixed-Phoneme BERT significantly improves the TTS
performance with 0.30 CMOS gain compared with the FastSpeech 2 baseline. The
Mixed-Phoneme BERT achieves 3x inference speedup and similar voice quality to
the previous TTS pre-trained model PnG BERT

event-based cameras has surpassed traditional image-based methods both in terms
of performance and memory efficiency. However, current methods still suffer
from (i) brittle image-level fusion of complementary interpolation results,
that fails in the presence of artifacts in the fused image, (ii) potentially
temporally inconsistent and inefficient motion estimation procedures, that run
for every inserted frame and (iii) low contrast regions that do not trigger
events, and thus cause events-only motion estimation to generate artifacts.
Moreover, previous methods were only tested on datasets consisting of planar
and faraway scenes, which do not capture the full complexity of the real world.
In this work, we address the above problems by introducing multi-scale
feature-level fusion and computing one-shot non-linear inter-frame motion from
events and images, which can be efficiently sampled for image warping. We also
collect the first large-scale events and frames dataset consisting of more than
100 challenging scenes with depth variations, captured with a new experimental
setup based on a beamsplitter. We show that our method improves the

modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. Conceptually, our
multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical
learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single
auto-correlated sequence. Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the
former setting--trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend
standard requirements for independent examples. Notably, we do not require that
trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable.
  For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced
by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in
statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few
(namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$). Specifically, we
establish that the worst-case error rate of this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$
whenever $m \gtrsim n$. Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp)
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by
a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system. A key upshot is that, in
domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves
as if all of the examples were independent, drawn from their marginals. As a
corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the linear system

representations by maximizing the similarity between the features extracted
from different crops of the same image regardless of cropping size and content.
In essence, this strategy ignores the fact that two crops may truly contain
different image information, e.g., background and small objects, and thus tends
to restrain the diversity of the learned representations. In this work, we
address this issue by introducing a new self-supervised learning strategy,
LoGo, that explicitly reasons about Local and Global crops. To achieve view
invariance, LoGo encourages similarity between global crops from the same
image, as well as between a global and a local crop. However, to correctly
encode the fact that the content of smaller crops may differ entirely, LoGo
promotes two local crops to have dissimilar representations, while being close
to global crops. Our LoGo strategy can easily be applied to existing SSL
methods. Our extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and using different
self-supervised learning frameworks validate its superiority over existing
approaches. Noticeably, we achieve better results than supervised models on

instance, in genetic fine-mapping, high correlations between nearby genetic
variants make it hard to identify the exact locations of causal variants. So
the statistical task is to output as many disjoint regions containing a signal
as possible, each as small as possible, while controlling false positives.
Similar problems arise in any application where signals cannot be perfectly
localized, such as locating stars in astronomical surveys and changepoint
detection in sequential data. Common Bayesian approaches to these problems
involve computing a posterior distribution over signal locations. However,
existing procedures to translate these posteriors into actual credible regions
for the signals fail to capture all the information in the posterior, leading
to lower power and (sometimes) inflated false discoveries. With this
motivation, we introduce Bayesian Linear Programming (BLiP). Given a posterior
distribution over signals, BLiP outputs credible regions for signals which
verifiably nearly maximize expected power while controlling false positives.
BLiP overcomes an extremely high-dimensional and nonconvex problem to
verifiably nearly maximize expected power while controlling false positives.
BLiP is very computationally efficient compared to the cost of computing the
posterior and can wrap around nearly any Bayesian model and algorithm. Applying
BLiP to existing state-of-the-art analyses of UK Biobank data (for genetic
fine-mapping) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (for astronomical point source
detection) increased power by 30-120% in just a few minutes of additional
computation. BLiP is implemented in pyblip (Python) and blipr (R).

Nambu-Goldstone boson due to the spontaneous breaking of anomaly-free global
flavor symmetry. One interesting possibility for such anomaly-free axion to
explain dark matter (DM) is when it has a mass of order keV and an intermediate
scale decay constant, since it can be explored through direct search
experiments, X-ray observations, various stellar cooling processes, and the
misalignment mechanism naturally explains the DM abundance. As a concrete
renormalizable model of such axion, we consider an extended Higgs sector with
global flavor symmetry, which consists of three Higgs doublet fields and three
singlet Higgs fields with $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ charges. We identify viable
parameter regions that satisfy theoretical bounds on the Higgs potential and
various experimental limits on this model, and evaluate the mass spectra of the
axion and extra Higgs bosons. We find that even an anomaly-free axion can
generally couple to photons through mixing with CP-odd Higgs, and that its
strength depends on the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets as well
as the axion mass. As a result, the ratios of the vacuum expectation values of
the Higgs doublets are tightly constrained to satisfy the X-ray constraints. We
show the favored parameter region where axion DM explains the XENON1T excess.
We also demonstrate that the axion-electron coupling is correlated with the
extra Higgs boson masses and mixing angles for CP-even Higgs bosons. Thus, if
the axion is detected in future observations, the extra Higgs boson masses and
the coupling of the standard model-like Higgs boson with the weak gauge bosons
are restricted. This is a good example of the synergy between searches for the
axion DM and the BSM around the electroweak scale.

In this work, we attempt to learn more about these processes by examining the
relationship between wrap-up effects and information-theoretic quantities, such
as word and context surprisals. We find that the distribution of information in
prior contexts is often predictive of sentence- and clause-final RTs (while not
of sentence-medial RTs). This lends support to several prior hypotheses about

challenges for these problems include (1) the problems lack the popular
lower-type properties such as prox-regularity assumed in many nonsmooth
nonconvex optimization algorithms, (2) the objective can not be analytically
expressed and (3) the evaluation of function values and subgradients are
computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this report first
examines the properties that exist in many two-stage problems, specifically
upper-C^2 objectives. Then, we show that quadratic penalty method for
security-constrained alternating current optimal power flow (SCACOPF)
contingency problems can make the contingency solution functions upper-C^2 .
Based on these observations, a simplified bundle algorithm that bears
similarity to sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is proposed. It is
more efficient in implementation and computation compared to conventional
bundle methods. Global convergence analysis of the algorithm is presented under
novel and reasonable assumptions. The proposed algorithm therefore fills the
gap of theoretical convergence for some smoothed SCACOPF problems. The
inconsistency that might arise in our treatment of the constraints are
addressed through a penalty algorithm whose convergence analysis is also
provided. Finally, theoretical capabilities and numerical performance of the

Specifically, we posit that human-like language should contain an amount of

entropy of the distribution over natural strings. Further, we posit that
language with substantially more (or less) information is undesirable. We
provide preliminary empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis; quality

common decoding strategies -- suggest high-quality text has an information
content significantly closer to the entropy than we would expect by chance.

a firm operating an algorithmic system, such as a digital content
recommendation platform, to cause change in a population of participants. We
relate performative power to the economic study of competition in digital
economies. Traditional economic concepts struggle with identifying
anti-competitive patterns in digital platforms not least due to the complexity
of market definition. In contrast, performative power is a causal notion that
is identifiable with minimal knowledge of the market, its internals,
participants, products, or prices.
  Low performative power implies that a firm can do no better than to optimize
their objective on current data. In contrast, firms of high performative power
stand to benefit from steering the population towards more profitable behavior.
We confirm in a simple theoretical model that monopolies maximize performative
power. A firm's ability to personalize increases performative power, while
competition and outside options decrease performative power. On the empirical
side, we propose an observational causal design to identify performative power
from discontinuities in how digital platforms display content. This allows to
repurpose causal effects from various studies about digital platforms as lower
bounds on performative power. Finally, we speculate about the role that
performative power might play in competition policy and antitrust enforcement

representation learning with several parameters, i.e., localization, dimension,

straightforward paradigm is sensitive to slight numerical deviations,
especially in localization. By exploiting the property that point clouds are
naturally captured on the surface of objects along with accurate location and
intensity information, we introduce a new perspective that views bounding box
regression as an implicit function. This leads to our proposed framework,
termed Implicit Detection or ImpDet, which leverages implicit field learning
for 3D object detection. Our ImpDet assigns specific values to points in
different local 3D spaces, thereby high-quality boundaries can be generated by
classifying points inside or outside the boundary. To solve the problem of
sparsity on the object surface, we further present a simple yet efficient
virtual sampling strategy to not only fill the empty region, but also learn
rich semantic features to help refine the boundaries. Extensive experimental
results on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and

metric structure of a random cubic planar graph is shown to be well
approximated by its unique 3-connected component of linear size, with modified
distances.
  Then, Whitney's theorem ensures that a 3-connected cubic planar graph is the
dual of a simple triangulation, for which it is known that the scaling limit is
the Brownian sphere. Curien and Le Gall have recently developed a framework to
study the modification of distances in general triangulations and in their

Besides, TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ features a highly unusual magnetic reorientation
transition about 100 K below the Curie point, whereby all spins in the system,
remaining collinear, rotate by 90$^\circ$. In this work, we address both issues

magnetic reorientation and the unusual temperature dependence of the anomalous

Tb, by virtue of the Mermin-Wagner theorem, have very different spin dynamics,
with Tb spins experiencing much more rapid fluctuation. We were able to cleanly
extract the intrinsic AHC from our experiment, and calculated the same

for ranking salient objects in an input video based on a predicted fixation

in the same frame locally and globally, and an inter-frame dynamic relation
(IDR) module to model the temporal relation of saliency across different
frames. In addition, to address the limited video types (just sports and

dataset that covers different video types and diverse scenes on a large scale.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art

existing efforts mainly attempt to reduce the number of required sampled

hand, Neural Light Field (NeLF) presents a more straightforward representation

residual MLP network (88 layers) to effectively learn the light field. We show
the key to successfully learning such a deep NeLF network is to have sufficient
data, for which we transfer the knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model via

generalisations of the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. After a
quantum quench in a clean quantum many-body system they generically display a
universal linear growth in time followed by saturation. While a finite
subsystem is essentially at local equilibrium when the entanglement saturates,
it is genuinely out-of-equilibrium in the growth phase. In particular, the
slope of the growth carries vital information on the nature of the system's
dynamics, and its characterisation is a key objective of current research. Here
we show that the slope of R\'enyi entropies can be determined by means of a
spacetime duality transformation. In essence, we argue that the slope coincides
with the stationary density of entropy of the model obtained by exchanging the
roles of space and time. Therefore, very surprisingly, the slope of the
entanglement is expressed as an equilibrium quantity. We use this observation
to find an explicit exact formula for the slope of R\'enyi entropies in all

Inspired by the promising performance of VQC, in this paper we propose
variational quantum pulses (VQP), a novel paradigm to directly train quantum

pulses by pulling and pushing the amplitudes of pulses in an optimization
framework. Similar to variational quantum algorithms, our framework to train

require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data to avoid this degradation
of knowledge. Unfortunately, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may
also violate data-privacy. Instead, we explore combining knowledge distillation
and parameter regularization in new ways to achieve strong continual learning
performance without rehearsal. Specifically, we take a deep dive into common
continual learning techniques: prediction distillation, feature distillation,
L2 parameter regularization, and EWC parameter regularization. We first
disprove the common assumption that parameter regularization techniques fail
for rehearsal-free continual learning of a single, expanding task. Next, we
explore how to leverage knowledge from a pre-trained model in rehearsal-free
continual learning and find that vanilla L2 parameter regularization
outperforms EWC parameter regularization and feature distillation. Finally, we
explore the recently popular ImageNet-R benchmark, and show that L2 parameter
regularization implemented in self-attention blocks of a ViT transformer
outperforms recent popular prompting for continual learning methods.

spatial cross-attention that each BEV query extracts the spatial features from
the regions of interest across camera views. For temporal information, we
propose temporal self-attention to recurrently fuse the history BEV
information. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art 56.9\% in terms of

  Concepts?","Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) 2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision-language (VL) pretrained models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal reasoning and zero-shot recognition tasks. Many of these VL
models are pretrained on unlabeled image and caption pairs from the internet.
In this paper, we study whether representations of primitive concepts--such as
colors, shapes, or the attributes of object parts--emerge automatically within
these pretrained VL models. We propose a two-step framework, Compositional
Concept Mapping (CompMap), to investigate this. CompMap first asks a VL model
to generate primitive concept activations with text prompts, and then learns to
construct a composition model that maps the primitive concept activations (e.g.
the likelihood of black tail or red wing) to composite concepts (e.g. a
red-winged blackbird). We show that a composition model can be reliably learn
from ground truth primitive concepts. We thus hypothesize that if primitive
concepts indeed emerge in a VL pretrained model, its primitive concept
activations can be used to learn a composition model similar to the one
designed by experts. We propose a quantitative metric to measure the degree of
similarity, and refer to the metric as the interpretability metric. We also
measure the classification accuracy when using the primitive concept
activations and the learned composition model to predict the composite
concepts, and refer to it as the usefulness metric. Our study reveals that
state-of-the-art VL pretrained models learn primitive concepts that are highly
useful for fine-grained visual recognition on the CUB dataset, and
compositional generalization tasks on the MIT-States dataset. However, we
observe that the learned composition models have low interpretability in our
qualitative analyses. Our results reveal the limitations of existing VL models,
and the necessity of pretraining objectives that encourage the acquisition of
primitive concepts.

such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the

long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In
particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a

trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills
by finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We show
the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object

accessing a family of fractionalized phases known as quantum spin liquids in

methods to study arrays assembled from Rydberg chains tuned to an Ising phase
transition that famously hosts emergent fermions propagating within each chain.
This highly entangled starting point allows us to naturally access spin liquids
familiar from Kitaev's honeycomb model, albeit from an entirely different
framework. In particular, we argue that finite-range repulsive Rydberg
interactions, which frustrate nearby symmetry-breaking orders, can enable
coherent propagation of emergent fermions between the chains in which they were
born. Delocalization of emergent fermions across the full two-dimensional
Rydberg array yields a gapless Z2 spin liquid with a single massless Dirac
cone. Here, the Rydberg occupation numbers exhibit universal power-law
correlations that provide a straightforward experimental diagnostic of this
phase. We further show that explicitly breaking symmetries perturbs the gapless
spin liquid into gapped, topologically ordered descendants: Breaking lattice
symmetries generates toric-code topological order, whereas introducing
chirality generates non-Abelian Ising topological order. In the toric-code
phase, we analytically construct microscopic incarnations of non-Abelian
defects, which can be created and transported by dynamically controlling the
atom positions in the array. Our work suggests that appropriately tuned Rydberg

$M_\odot$ model at solar metallicity up to the end of oxygen burning. The MRI
is computed with different trigger conditions, (depending on the weighting of
chemical gradients through an arbitrary but commonly used factor), and with
different treatments of meridional circulation as either advective or
diffusive. We also compare the MRI with the Tayler-Spruit (TS) dynamo, in
models that included both instabilities interacting linearly. The MRI triggers
throughout stellar evolution. Its activation is highly sensitive to the
treatment of meridional circulation and the existence of chemical gradients.
The MRI is very efficient at transporting both matter and AM, leading to
noticeable differences in rotation rates and chemical structure, which may be
observable in young main sequence stars. While the TS dynamo is the dominant
mechanism for transferring AM, the MRI remains relevant in models where both
instabilities are included. Extrapolation of our results suggests that models
including the MRI tend to develop more compact cores, which likely produce
failed explosions and black holes, than models where only the TS dynamo is
included (where explosions an neutron stars may be more frequent. The MRI is an
important factor in massive star evolution but is very sensitive to the
implementation ofother processes in the model. The transport of AM and chemical
elements due to the MRI alters the rotation rates and the chemical make-up of
the star from the core to the surface, and may change the explodability
properties of massive stars.

we train several ML methods both on image and tabular data containing
physically relevant features extracted from the images. We find that our
evaluated ML models are capable of producing catalogues of similar quality as
the existing ones. The best performing methods, ensemble-based models like
random forests and convolutional neural networks, recover ~ 90-94 % of GCs
while producing an acceptable amount of false detections (~ 6-8 %) - with some
falsely detected sources being identifiable as GCs that have not been labelled
as such in the used catalogues. In the magnitude range 22 < m4_g < 24.5 mag, 98
- 99 % of GCs are recovered. We even find such high performance levels when
training on Virgo and evaluating on Fornax data (and vice versa), illustrating
that the models are transferable to environments with different conditions such
as different distances than in the used training data. Additionally, we
demonstrate how interpretable methods can be used to better understand model
predictions, recovering that magnitudes, colours, and sizes are important for
identifying GCs. These are encouraging results, indicating that similar methods
can be applied for creating GC catalogues for a large number of galaxies.

system's origins and architecture. We confirm a second planet in the system
with $M_{\rm c}= 0.40 \pm 0.09M_{\rm jup}$ and P$_{\rm c}= 1919\pm 27\,$days.
We simulated the dynamical evolution of planet b in the presence of planet c
and find a variety of possible outcomes for the system, such as tidal migration
and engulfment. The system is consistent with an in situ dynamical origin of
planet b followed by subsequent Eccentric Kozai Lidov (EKL) perturbations that
excite Kepler-1656b's eccentricity gently, i.e. without initiating tidal
migration. Thus, despite its high eccentricity, we find no evidence that planet
b is or has migrated through the high-eccentricity channel. Finally, we predict
the outer orbit to be mutually inclined in a nearly perpendicular configuration
with respect to the inner planet orbit based on the outcomes of our
simulations, and make observable predictions for the inner planet's spin-orbit
angle. Our methodology can be applied to other eccentric or tidally locked
planets to constrain their origins, orbital configurations and properties of a
potential companion.

the jets is governed by factors other than previously believed.

reconstructs the final density and velocity fields as natural byproducts. We
implement this field-based physical inference approach by adapting the Bayesian

We test the self-consistency of the method using random sets of mock tracers,
and assess its accuracy in a more complex scenario where peculiar velocity
tracers are non-linearly evolved mock haloes. We find that our framework
self-consistently infers the initial conditions, density and velocity fields,

coupled plasma subject to a very intense external magnetic field. We previously
showed that in a particular model, any photon produced by the plasma had to be
in its only polarization state parallel to the reaction plane. In this paper we
consider a construction that relaxes a formerly imposed constraint, permitting
the emission of photons with either out-plane or in-plane polarization. This
constitutes a completion of our former study because the fully back-reacted
equations decouple for these two polarization states in such a manner that
those involving the in-plane are identical to the ones we explored previously.
In view of the above, part of the details concerning the calculations and of
the numerical results for the differential rate of emitted photons that we
present here correspond exactly to those omitted in our preceding letter. One
of our main results is that the production of photons is increased by the
introduction of a non-vanishing magnetic field with an intensity up to a value
$B_{\vartheta}$, above which the effect is reversed and said production becomes
lower than the $B=0$ case. The characteristic intensity $B_{\vartheta}$ depends
on the propagation direction and tends to zero as the photon momentum becomes
aligned with the magnetic field. Additionally, we also show that the magnetic
field has the effect of increasing the value of the elliptic flow, providing a
possible explanation for the excess measured in collision experiments. The
holographic model is constructed using an effective five-dimensional action
that includes a scalar field in addition to the constant magnetic field.

luminous hydrogen-poor stars with low mass loss rates and transparent winds.
Both types are potential progenitors of Type I core-collapse supernovae (SNe).
We use grids of core-collapse models obtained from helium stars at different
metallicities to study the effects of metallicity on the transients and
remnants these stars produce. We characterise the surface and core properties
of our core collapse models, and investigate their explodability employing
three criteria. In cases where explosions are predicted, we estimate the ejecta
mass, explosion energy, nickel mass and neutron star (NS) mass. Otherwise, we
predict the mass of the resulting black hole (BH). We construct a simplified
population model, and find that the properties SNe and compact objects depend
strongly on metallicity. Ejecta masses and explosion energies for Type Ic SNe
are best reproduced by models with Z=0.04 which exhibit strong winds during
core helium burning. This implies that either their mass loss rates are
underestimated, or that Type Ic SN progenitors experience mass loss through
other mechanisms before exploding. The distributions of ejecta masses,
explosion energies and nickel mass for Type Ib SNe are not well reproduced by
progenitor models with WR mass loss, but are better reproduced if we assume no
mass loss in progenitors with luminosities below the minimum WR star
luminosity. We find that Type Ic SNe become more common as metallicity
increases, and that the vast majority of progenitors of Type Ib SNe must be
transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars. We find several models with
pre-collapse CO-masses of up to $\sim 30 M_{\odot}$ may form $\sim 3 M_{\odot}$
BHs in fallback SNe. This may carry important consequences for our
understanding of SNe, binary BH and NS systems, X-ray binary systems and

originating also in the disc, superimposed with a small-amplitude (< 0.1 mag)
ellipsoidal modulation from the companion star due to geometrical effects. A
long-term (~2300 days) downward trend, followed by a shorter (~1000 days)
upward one, is observed in the disc light curve. Such a rise in the optical has
been observed for other X-ray binaries preceding outbursts, as predicted by the

~3 years, and culminated in a flux increase at all wavelengths
(optical-UV-X-rays) at the end of 2020. This increase faded after ~2 weeks,
without giving rise to a full outburst. We suggest that the propagation of an
inside-out heating front was ignited due to a partial ionization of hydrogen in
the inner disc. The propagation might have stalled soon after the ignition due
to the increasing surface density in the disc that the front encountered while
propagating outwards. The stall was likely eased by the low level irradiation
of the outer regions of the large accretion disc, as shown by the slope of the

only available sensing modality. We present Tactile Slam (tSLAM) -- which
prepares an agent to acquire information seeking behavior and use implicit
understanding of common household items to reconstruct the geometric details of
the object under exploration. Using the anthropomorphic `ADROIT' hand, we
demonstrate that tSLAM is highly effective in reconstructing objects of varying

mixtures of pollutants. As epidemiologic studies of mixtures can be expensive
to conduct, it behooves researchers to incorporate prior knowledge about
mixtures into their analyses. This work extends the Bayesian multiple index
model (BMIM), which assumes the exposure-response function is a non-parametric
function of a set of linear combinations of pollutants formed with a set of
exposure-specific weights. The framework is attractive because it combines the
flexibility of response-surface methods with the interpretability of linear
index models. We propose three strategies to incorporate prior toxicological
knowledge into construction of indices in a BMIM: (a) constraining index
weights, (b) structuring index weights by exposure transformations, and (c)
placing informative priors on the index weights. We propose a novel prior
specification that combines spike-and-slab variable selection with informative
Dirichlet distribution based on relative potency factors often derived from
previous toxicological studies. In simulations we show that the proposed priors
improve inferences when prior information is correct and can protect against
misspecification suffered by naive toxicological models when prior information
is incorrect. Moreover, different strategies may be mixed-and-matched for
different indices to suit available information (or lack thereof). We
demonstrate the proposed methods on an analysis of data from the National

are a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular
string representation, SMILES, has powered cheminformatics since the late
1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, SMILES has several
shortcomings -- most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid
results with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new
language for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100\% robustness:
SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings). SELFIES has since simplified and
enabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this manuscript, we look to
the future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their
respective opportunities and challenges. We propose 16 concrete Future Projects
for robust molecular representations. These involve the extension toward new
chemical domains, exciting questions at the interface of AI and robust
languages and interpretability for both humans and machines. We hope that these
proposals will inspire several follow-up works exploiting the full potential of
molecular string representations for the future of AI in chemistry and
materials science.

decentralization, security, and transparency have encouraged remote voting

anonymity, robustness, and scalability are common problems in blockchain-based
election systems. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based,
ranked-choice election protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and
scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to cast their
votes via zero-knowledge proofs anonymously. Robustness is realized by removing
the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using
timed-state machines. Results show that ElectAnon is scalable amongst existing
works as it reduces the gas consumption up to 89% compared to previous works.
The proposed protocol includes a candidate proposal system and swappable

multiple traits simultaneously. However, current reverse genotype prediction
approaches are mostly based on linear models. Here, we evaluated random forest
regression (RFR) as a method to predict SNPs from imaging QTs and identify
biologically relevant associations. We learned machine learning models to
predict 518,484 SNPs using 56 brain imaging QTs. We observed that genotype
regression error is a better indicator of permutation p-value significance than
genotype classification accuracy. SNPs within the known Alzheimer disease (AD)
risk gene APOE had lowest RMSE for lasso and random forest, but not ridge
regression. Moreover, random forests identified additional SNPs that were not
prioritized by the linear models but are known to be associated with
brain-related disorders. Feature selection identified well-known brain regions
associated with AD,like the hippocampus and amygdala, as important predictors
of the most significant SNPs. In summary, our results indicate that non-linear

wave packets to smaller scales. Neither prediction for the net downscale
transport of energy compares well with observations. Here we compare ray
tracing numerical results with metrics derived using a wave turbulence
derivation for the kinetic equation and using path integral techniques. At
small inertial wave amplitudes, all three provide consistent descriptions for
the mean drift and dispersion about that mean drift. At oceanic amplitudes,
however, the numerics support diminished transport and dispersion. This
coincides with the mean drift time scale becoming similar to the correlation
time scale, which we parse as the signature of a transition to a non-Markovian
process. espite this decrease, estimates of downscale energy transfer are still
significantly larger than expected from oceanic derived metrics. We offer the
hypothesis that differences between the ray-path formulation and observations

methods to search the full parameter space much faster than conventional tools.
Only a single equilibrium solution is needed at each optimization step thanks
to automatic differentiation, which efficiently provides exact derivative
information. A Gauss-Newton trust-region optimization method uses second-order
derivative information to take large steps in parameter space and converges
rapidly. With just-in-time compilation and GPU portability, high-dimensional
stellarator optimization runs take orders of magnitude less computation time
with DESC compared to other approaches. This paper presents the theory of the
DESC fixed-boundary local optimization algorithm along with demonstrations of
how to easily implement it in the code. Example quasi-symmetry optimizations
are shown and compared to results from conventional tools. Three different
forms of quasi-symmetry objectives are available in DESC, and their relative
advantages are discussed in detail. In the examples presented, the triple
product formulation yields the best optimization results in terms of minimized
computation time and particle transport. This paper concludes with an
explanation of how the modular code suite can be extended to accommodate other
types of optimization problems.

and diagnosing hemidiaphragm paralysis is to perform the fluoroscopic sniff
test. The images are visually examined by an experienced radiologist, and if
one hemidiaphragm ascends while the other descends, then it is described as
paradoxical motion, which is highly suggestive of hemidiaphragm paralysis.
However, diagnosis can be challenging because diaphragm motion during sniffing
is fast, paradoxical motion can be subtle, and the analysis is based on a
2-dimensional projection of a 3-dimensional surface. This paper presents a case
of chronic left hemidiaphragm elevation that was initially reported as mild
paradoxical motion on fluoroscopy. After measuring the elevations of the
diaphragms and modeling their temporal correlation using Gaussian process
regression, the systematic trend of the hemidiaphragmatic motion along with its
stochastic properties was determined. When analyzing the trajectories of the
hemidiaphragms, no statistically significant paradoxical motion was detected.
This could potentially change the prognosis if the patient was to consider
diaphragm plication as treatment. The presented method provides a more
objective analysis of hemidiaphragm motions and can potentially improve
diagnostic accuracy.

to make further hypotheses on its spin and not to assume any particular model
for its spin tensor (or its vanishing). The analysis focuses on a
\textquotedblleft weak-torsion regime,\textquotedblright\ such that
gravitational wave emission, at leading and subleading orders, does not deviate
from standard General Relativity. We show that, in principle, the background
torsion induced by an eventual dark matter spin component could lead to an
anomalous dampening or amplification of the gravitational wave amplitude, after
going across a long cosmological distance. We assess the importance of this
torsion-induced anomalous amplitude propagation for binary black hole mergers
in a way as model-free as possible in Einstein-Cartan gravity. It is possible
to prove that at its best, for realistic late-universe cosmological scenarios,
the effect is tiny and falls below detection thresholds, even for near-future
interferometers such as LISA. Therefore, detecting this effect may not be
impossible, but it is still beyond our technological capabilities. As a
model-independent result in the Einstein-Cartan context, it also implies that
mergers are robust standard sirens without considering any potential
dark-matter-induced torsional effects.

of methods for estimating the system independent material properties of

to accurately reconstruct rho-e and Z-e even at large values of Z-e. SIRZ-3
relies on the use of a new non-linear differentiable forward measurement model

reviewers make and how do they affect understanding of the contribution? We
analyze ca.700K review comments on 2,000 (Java and Python) GitHub projects, and
propose several filters to identify which comments are likely to be either in
response to a change in documentation and/or call for such a change. We
identify 65K such cases. We next develop a taxonomy of the reviewer intents
behind such ""comments on comments"". We find that achieving a shared
understanding of the code is key: reviewer comments most often focused on
clarification, followed by pointing out issues to fix, such as typos and
outdated comments. Curiously, clarifying comments were frequently suggested
(often verbatim) by the reviewer, indicating a desire to persist their
understanding acquired during code review. We conclude with a discussion of
implications of our comments-on-comments dataset for research on improving code
review, including the potential benefits for automating code review.

\yiming{Traditionally, missing value imputation has been studied as an offline

missing value imputation and proposes QUIP, which only imputes minimal missing
values to answer the query. Specifically, by taking a reasonable good query

query processing overhead. QUIP proposes a new implementation of outer join to
preserve missing values in query processing and a bloom filter based index
structure to optimize the space and runtime overhead. QUIP also designs a
cost-based decision function to automatically guide each operator to impute
missing values now or delay imputations. Efficient optimizations are proposed
to speed-up aggregate operations in QUIP, such as MAX/MIN operator. Extensive
experiments on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrates the effectiveness

tool for causal inference in many empirical studies where unmeasured

The high-dimensional linear instrumental-variables regression has been
considered in the literature due to its simplicity albeit a true nonlinear
relationship may exist. We propose a more data-driven approach by considering
the nonparametric additive models between the instruments and the treatments
while keeping a linear model between the treatments and the outcome so that the

two-stage framework for estimation and inference under this more general setup.
The group lasso regularization is first employed to select optimal instruments
from the high-dimensional additive models, and the outcome variable is then
regressed on the fitted values from the additive models to identify and
estimate important treatment effects. We provide non-asymptotic analysis of the
estimation error of the proposed estimator. A debiasing procedure is further
employed to yield valid inference. Extensive numerical experiments show that
our method can rival or outperform existing approaches in the literature. We

study the problem of using vision and tactile inputs together to complete the
task of following deformable linear objects, for the first time. We create a
Reinforcement Learning agent using different sensing modalities and investigate
how its behaviour can be boosted using visual-tactile fusion, compared to using
a single sensing modality. To this end, we developed a benchmark in simulation
for manipulating the deformable linear objects using multimodal sensing inputs.
The policy of the agent uses distilled information, e.g., the pose of the
object in both visual and tactile perspectives, instead of the raw sensing
signals, so that it can be directly transferred to real environments. In this
way, we disentangle the perception system and the learned control policy. Our
extensive experiments show that the use of both vision and tactile inputs,
together with proprioception, allows the agent to complete the task in up to
92% of cases, compared to 77% when only one of the signals is given. Our

participates in the definition of the variation of the matter part of the

of the requirement of symmetry under general coordinate transformations. The
effect of the cosmological coupling $\Lambda$ is accommodated within a possible

thereby showing the existence of an attractor point for reasonable hypotheses
on the potential $V(\phi)$ and no particular assumption on the Hubble function.
The phase space analysis is performed both with the linear stability theory and
via the more general Lyapunov's method. Either method lead to the conclusion
that the condition $\dot{G}/G=\sigma\left(\dot{c}/c\right)$ where $\sigma=3$
must hold for the rest of cosmic evolution after the system gets to the

continuity equation in our scalar-tensor model and considering two possible
regimes for the varying speed of light -- decreasing $c(a)$ and increasing

that can re-orient to the planet's new equatorial plane and accrete into
Uranus' 4 major satellites. The needed reorientation out to distances
comparable to outermost Oberon requires that the impact creates an inner disk
with $\ge 1\%$ of Uranus' mass. We here simulate giant impacts that
appropriately tilt the planet and leave the system with an angular momentum
comparable to that of the current system. We find that such impacts do not
produce inner debris disks massive enough to realign the outer debris disk to
the post-impact equatorial plane. Although our results are inconsistent with
the apparent requirements of a co-accretion + giant impact model, we suggest
alternatives that merit further exploration.

species presence from either abundance or presence-absence data collected
across sites with repeated sampling occasions. In the last two decades, a broad
class of occupancy models has been developed, but little attention has been
given to examining the effects of heterogeneity in parameter estimation. This
study focuses on occupancy models where heterogeneity is present in detection
intensity and the presence probability. We show that the presence probability
will be underestimated if detection heterogeneity is ignored. On the other
hand, the behavior is different if heterogeneity in the presence probability is
ignored; notably, an estimate of the average presence probability may be
unbiased or over- or under-estimated depending on the relationship between
detection and presence probabilities. In addition, when heterogeneity in the
detection intensity is related to covariates, we propose a conditional
likelihood approach to estimate the detection intensity parameters. This
alternative method shares an optimal estimating function property and it
ensures robustness against model specification on the presence probability. We
then propose a consistent estimator for the average presence probability,
provided that the detection intensity component model is correctly specified.
We illustrate the bias effects and estimator performance in simulation studies
and real data analysis.

predictive capability are acquired at varying costs. In order to optimize the
performance-cost trade-off, one would select features to observe a priori.
However, given the changing context with previous observations, the subset of
predictive features to select may change dynamically. Therefore, we face the
challenging new problem of foresight dynamic selection (FDS): finding a dynamic
and light-weight policy to decide which features to observe next, before
actually observing them, for overall performance-cost trade-offs. To tackle
FDS, this paper proposes a Bayesian learning framework of Variational Foresight
Dynamic Selection (VFDS). VFDS learns a policy that selects the next feature
subset to observe, by optimizing a variational Bayesian objective that
characterizes the trade-off between model performance and feature cost. At its
core is an implicit variational distribution on binary gates that are dependent
on previous observations, which will select the next subset of features to
observe. We apply VFDS on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task where the
performance-cost trade-off is critical in its practice. Extensive results
demonstrate that VFDS selects different features under changing contexts,
notably saving sensory costs while maintaining or improving the HAR accuracy.
Moreover, the features that VFDS dynamically select are shown to be
interpretable and associated with the different activity types. We will release
the code.

making under uncertainty. It is particularly appealing because of its ability

decision-making with some auxiliary information, and DRO in the context of
conditional distribution is not straightforward. We propose a conditional
kernel distributionally robust optimization (CKDRO) method that enables robust
decision making under conditional distributions through kernel DRO and the
conditional mean operator in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In
particular, we consider problems where there is a correlation between the
unknown variable y and an auxiliary observable variable x. Given past data of
the two variables and a queried auxiliary variable, CKDRO represents the
conditional distribution P(y|x) as the conditional mean operator in the RKHS
space and quantifies the ambiguity set in the RKHS as well, which depends on
the size of the dataset as well as the query point. To justify the use of RKHS,
we demonstrate that the ambiguity set defined in RKHS can be viewed as a ball
under a metric that is similar to the Wasserstein metric. The DRO is then
dualized and solved via a finite dimensional convex program. The proposed CKDRO
approach is applied to a generation scheduling problem and shows that the
result of CKDRO is superior to common benchmarks in terms of quality and

MOF is written in Python 3, and it used object-oriented programming to create a
modular design that allows users to easily incorporate new optimization
algorithms, methods, or engineering design problems into the framework.
Additionally, a common input file allows users to easily specify design
problems, update the optimization parameters, and perform comparisons between
various optimization methods and algorithms. In the current MOF version,
genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) approaches are implemented.
Applications in different nuclear engineering optimization problems are

algorithms within MOF are demonstrated through an unconstrained nuclear fuel
assembly pin lattice optimization, a first cycle fuel loading constrained
optimization of a three-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), and a third cycle

efficiently searched the solution spaces and found optimized solutions to the

demonstrate the capabilities of the existing optimization tools within MOF, and

avoiding the coincidence limit, semiclassical gravity can also accommodate
nonlocal aspects. Motivated by these results, we study if it is possible to
construct geometrical theories of gravitation that are nonlocal in the sense of
Bell. We propose three constructions of such theories, which could constitute
an important step towards our understanding of the interplay between quantum
mechanics and gravitation.

  Machine Learning Classifiers for Intrusion Detection in Computer Networks",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Attacks on computer networks have increased significantly in recent days, due
in part to the availability of sophisticated tools for launching such attacks
as well as thriving underground cyber-crime economy to support it. Over the
past several years, researchers in academia and industry used machine learning
(ML) techniques to design and implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for
computer networks. Many of these researchers used datasets collected by various
organizations to train ML models for predicting intrusions. In many of the
datasets used in such systems, data are imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have
equal amount of samples). With unbalanced data, the predictive models developed
using ML algorithms may produce unsatisfactory classifiers which would affect
accuracy in predicting intrusions. Traditionally, researchers used
over-sampling and under-sampling for balancing data in datasets to overcome
this problem. In this work, in addition to over-sampling, we also use a
synthetic data generation method, called Conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (CTGAN), to balance data and study their effect on various ML
classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, no one else has used CTGAN to
generate synthetic samples to balance intrusion detection datasets. Based on
extensive experiments using a widely used dataset NSL-KDD, we found that
training ML models on dataset balanced with synthetic samples generated by
CTGAN increased prediction accuracy by up to $8\%$, compared to training the
same ML models over unbalanced data. Our experiments also show that the
accuracy of some ML models trained over data balanced with random over-sampling
decline compared to the same ML models trained over unbalanced data.

attention in the object detection literature since they can alleviate the cost

small fraction of fully-labeled images with information in weakly-labeled

pseudo-ground-truth (GT) bounding box annotations in an online fashion,
eliminating the need for multi-stage training, and student-teacher network

based on the categorical score of object proposals accumulated via a score

the proposed approach improves performance by 5.0% when using VOC 2007 as

design complicated neural networks with powerful feature representations, but
ignore the universal domain shift induced by time-varying land cover changes,
including luminance fluctuations and season changes between pre-event and
post-event images, thereby producing sub-optimal results. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end Supervised Domain Adaptation framework for cross-domain
Change Detection, namely SDACD, to effectively alleviate the domain shift
between bi-temporal images for better change predictions. Specifically, our
SDACD presents collaborative adaptations from both image and feature
perspectives with supervised learning. Image adaptation exploits generative
adversarial learning with cycle-consistency constraints to perform cross-domain
style transformation, effectively narrowing the domain gap in a two-side
generation fashion. As to feature adaptation, we extract domain-invariant
features to align different feature distributions in the feature space, which
could further reduce the domain gap of cross-domain images. To further improve
the performance, we combine three types of bi-temporal images for the final
change prediction, including the initial input bi-temporal images and two
generated bi-temporal images from the pre-event and post-event domains.
Extensive experiments and analyses on two benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and universality of our proposed framework. Notably, our

Despite some early research on locked issues, there is a lack of understanding
of how communities use this feature and of potential threats to validity for
researchers relying on a dataset of locked issues as an oracle for heated
discussions. To address this gap, we (i) quantitatively analyzed 79 GitHub

qualitatively analyzed all issues locked as too heated of the 79 projects, a
total of 205 issues comprising 5,511 comments. We found that projects have
different behaviors when locking issues: while 54 locked less than 10% of their
closed issues, 14 projects locked more than 90% of their closed issues.
Additionally, locked issues tend to have a similar number of comments,

information flow in wireless networks. Recently, low-latency provenance
embedding algorithms have received traction in vehicular networks owing to
strict deadlines on the delivery of packets. While existing low-latency
provenance embedding methods focus on reducing the packet delay, they assume a
complete graph on the underlying topology due to the mobility of the
participating nodes. We identify that the complete graph assumption leads to
sub-optimal performance in provenance recovery, especially when the vehicular
network is sparse, which is usually observed outside peak-hour traffic
conditions. As a result, we propose a two-part approach to design provenance
embedding algorithms for sparse vehicular networks. In the first part, we
propose secure and practical topology-learning strategies, whereas in the
second part, we design provenance embedding algorithms that guarantee
ultra-reliability by incorporating the topology knowledge at the destination
during the provenance recovery process. Besides the novel idea of using
topology knowledge for provenance recovery, a distinguishing feature for
achieving ultra-reliability is the use of hash-chains in the packet, which
trade communication-overhead of the packet with the complexity-overhead at the
destination. We derive tight upper bounds on the performance of our strategies,
and show that the derived bounds, when optimized with appropriate constraints,
deliver design parameters that outperform existing methods. Finally, we also
implement our ideas on OMNeT++ based simulation environment to show that their

  2. when the oriented matroid $N$ corresponds to an unoriented matroid (that

amplitude, 2-10 keV photon counts and redshift. We find that the prediction
accuracy of the neural network model is significantly higher than what is
obtained from the traditional linear regression method. Our predicted mass can
be confined within $\pm (2$-5) per cent of the true value, suggesting that the
neural network technique is a promising and independent way to constrain the
black hole mass. We also apply the model to 21 non-reverberating AGN to rule
out their possibility to exhibit the lags (some have too small mass and $F_{\rm
var}$, while some have too large mass and $F_{\rm var}$ that contradict the
$F_{\rm var}$-lag-mass relation in reverberating AGN). We also simulate 3200
reverberating AGN samples using the multi-feature parameter space from the
neural network model to investigate the global relations if the number of
reverberating AGN increases. We find that the $F_{\rm var}$-mass
anti-correlation is likely stronger with increasing number of newly-discovered
reverberating AGN. Contrarily, to maintain the lag-mass scaling relation, the
tight anti-correlation between the lag and $F_{\rm var}$ must preserve. In an
extreme case, the lag-mass correlation coefficient can significantly decrease
and, if observed, may suggest the extended corona framework where their
observed lags are more driven by the coronal property rather than geometry.

reconstruct the input acoustic features. The autoencoder is trained by
simultaneously minimizing the ASR loss and feature reconstruction error. The

various language understanding tasks in IR systems, which require the
fine-tuning process based on labeled training data. For low-resource scenarios,
prompt-based learning for PLMs exploits prompts as task guidance and turns
downstream tasks into masked language problems for effective few-shot
fine-tuning. In most existing approaches, the high performance of prompt-based
learning heavily relies on handcrafted prompts and verbalizers, which may limit
the application of such approaches in real-world scenarios. To solve this
issue, we present CP-Tuning, the first end-to-end Contrastive Prompt Tuning
framework for fine-tuning PLMs without any manual engineering of task-specific
prompts and verbalizers. It is integrated with the task-invariant continuous
prompt encoding technique with fully trainable prompt parameters. We further
propose the pair-wise cost-sensitive contrastive learning procedure to optimize
the model in order to achieve verbalizer-free class mapping and enhance the
task-invariance of prompts. It explicitly learns to distinguish different
classes and makes the decision boundary smoother by assigning different costs
to easy and hard cases. Experiments over a variety of language understanding
tasks used in IR systems and different PLMs show that CP-Tuning outperforms

offers a modular qubit architecture which can be transported across different
environments, and atomistically tailored for targeted applications through
bottom-up design and synthesis. Here we demonstrate how the spin coherence in
such optically addressable molecular qubits can be controlled through
engineering their host environment. By inserting chromium (IV)-based molecular
qubits into a non-isostructural host matrix, we generate noise-insensitive
clock transitions, through a transverse zero-field splitting, that are not
present when using an isostructural host. This host-matrix engineering leads to
spin-coherence times of more than 10 microseconds for optically addressable
molecular spin qubits in a nuclear and electron-spin rich environment. We model
the dependence of spin coherence on transverse zero-field splitting from first
principles and experimentally verify the theoretical predictions with four
distinct molecular systems. Finally, we explore how to further enhance
optical-spin interfaces in molecular qubits by investigating the key parameters
of optical linewidth and spin-lattice relaxation time. Our results demonstrate
the ability to test qubit structure-function relationships through a tunable

complicated because the inconsistency in the category range across datasets
transforms fully supervised learning into semi-supervised learning. To address
this problem, recent studies focus on the generation of high-quality missing
annotations. In this study, we first point out that it is not enough to
generate high-quality annotations using a single model, which only looks once
for annotations. Through detailed experimental analyses, we further conclude
that hard-label training is conducive to generating high-recall annotations,
while soft-label training tends to obtain high-precision annotations. Inspired
by the aspects mentioned above, we propose a dynamic supervisor framework that
updates the annotations multiple times through multiple-updated submodels
trained using hard and soft labels. In the final generated annotations, both
recall and precision improve significantly through the integration of
hard-label training with soft-label training. Extensive experiments conducted
on various dataset combination settings support our analyses and demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed dynamic supervisor.

employed as incremental stream transducers -- that have application to
robotics: e.g., to model combinatorial estimators and also as concise encodings
of feedback plans/policies. The present paper examines their minimization
problem under some new assumptions. Compared to strictly deterministic filters,
allowing nondeterminism supplies opportunities for compression via re-use of
states. But this paper suggests that the classic automata-theoretic concept of
nondeterminism, though it affords said opportunities for reduction in state
complexity, is problematic in many robotics settings. Instead, we argue for a
new constrained type of nondeterminism that preserves input-output behavior for
circumstances when, as for robots, causation forbids 'rewinding' of the world.
We identify problem instances where compression under this constrained form of
nondeterminism results in improvements over all deterministic filters. In this
new setting, we examine computational complexity questions for the problem of
reducing the state complexity of some given input filter. A hardness result for
general deterministic input filters is presented, as well as for checking
specific, narrower requirements, and some special cases. These results show
that this class of nondeterminism gives problems of the same complexity class
as classical nondeterminism, and the narrower questions help give a more
nuanced understanding of the source of this complexity.

  Distilling Knowledge from Dense Embeddings","Accepted by SIGIR 2022",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vector quantization (VQ) based ANN indexes, such as Inverted File System
(IVF) and Product Quantization (PQ), have been widely applied to embedding
based document retrieval thanks to the competitive time and memory efficiency.
Originally, VQ is learned to minimize the reconstruction loss, i.e., the
distortions between the original dense embeddings and the reconstructed
embeddings after quantization. Unfortunately, such an objective is inconsistent
with the goal of selecting ground-truth documents for the input query, which
may cause severe loss of retrieval quality. Recent works identify such a
defect, and propose to minimize the retrieval loss through contrastive
learning. However, these methods intensively rely on queries with ground-truth
documents, whose performance is limited by the insufficiency of labeled data.
  In this paper, we propose Distill-VQ, which unifies the learning of IVF and
PQ within a knowledge distillation framework. In Distill-VQ, the dense
embeddings are leveraged as ""teachers"", which predict the query's relevance to
the sampled documents. The VQ modules are treated as the ""students"", which are
learned to reproduce the predicted relevance, such that the reconstructed
embeddings may fully preserve the retrieval result of the dense embeddings. By
doing so, Distill-VQ is able to derive substantial training signals from the
massive unlabeled data, which significantly contributes to the retrieval
quality. We perform comprehensive explorations for the optimal conduct of
knowledge distillation, which may provide useful insights for the learning of
VQ based ANN index. We also experimentally show that the labeled data is no
longer a necessity for high-quality vector quantization, which indicates
Distill-VQ's strong applicability in practice.

computationally analyze linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) where the

integral terms and performing stability analysis using the PIE framework. More
specifically, we show that PDEs with the integral terms where the integration
is with respect to the spatial variable and the kernel of the integral operator
is matrix-valued polynomials can be converted to PIEs if the boundary
conditions satisfy certain criteria. The conversion is performed by using a
change of variable where every PDE state is substituted in terms of its highest
derivative and boundary values to obtain a new equation (a PIE) in a variable
that does not have any continuity requirements. Later, we show that this change
of variable can be represented using explicit maps from the parameters of the
PDE to the parameters of the PIE and the stability test can be posed as an
optimization problem involving these parameters. Lastly, we present numerical
examples to demonstrate the simplicity and application of this method.

getting trapped in local optimum. In this paper, we propose a method called
NEvoNAS wherein the NAS problem is posed as a multi-objective problem with 2
objectives: (i) maximize architecture novelty, (ii) maximize architecture
fitness/accuracy. The novelty search is used for maintaining a diverse set of
solutions at each generation which helps avoiding local optimum traps while the
architecture fitness is calculated using supernet. NSGA-II is used for finding
the \textit{pareto optimal front} for the NAS problem and the best architecture
in the pareto front is returned as the searched architecture. Exerimentally,
NEvoNAS gives better results on 2 different search spaces while using

sub-aperture images, do not consider the structural characteristics across the
views, so they usually require additional disparity and spatial structure cues
for follow-up tasks. Besides, they have difficulties dealing with occlusions or
larger disparity scenes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Epipolar
Focus Spectrum (EFS) representation by rearranging the EPI spectrum. Different
from the classical EPI representation where an EPI line corresponds to a
specific depth, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EFS line to the view.
Accordingly, compared to a sparsely-sampled light field, a densely-sampled one
with the same field of view (FoV) leads to a more compact distribution of such
linear structures in the double-cone-shaped region with the identical opening
angle in its corresponding EFS. Hence the EFS representation is invariant to
the scene depth. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop a trainable
EFS-based pipeline for light field reconstruction, where a dense light field
can be reconstructed by compensating the ""missing EFS lines"" given a sparse
light field, yielding promising results with cross-view consistency, especially
in the presence of severe occlusion and large disparity. Experimental results
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity and
superiority of the proposed method over SOTA methods.

observation from the findings section and is the most important section for
radiologists to communicate to physicians. Summarizing findings is
time-consuming and can be prone to error for inexperienced radiologists, and
thus automatic impression generation has attracted substantial attention. With
the encoder-decoder framework, most previous studies explore incorporating
extra knowledge (e.g., static pre-defined clinical ontologies or extra
background information). Yet, they encode such knowledge by a separate encoder
to treat it as an extra input to their models, which is limited in leveraging
their relations with the original findings. To address the limitation, we
propose a unified framework for exploiting both extra knowledge and the
original findings in an integrated way so that the critical information (i.e.,
key words and their relations) can be extracted in an appropriate way to
facilitate impression generation. In detail, for each input findings, it is
encoded by a text encoder, and a graph is constructed through its entities and
dependency tree. Then, a graph encoder (e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs)) is
adopted to model relation information in the constructed graph. Finally, to
emphasize the key words in the findings, contrastive learning is introduced to
map positive samples (constructed by masking non-key words) closer and push
apart negative ones (constructed by masking key words). The experimental
results on OpenI and MIMIC-CXR confirm the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

displacement tracking measurements of multiple biaxial stretching protocols on
a porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet, with which we build a neural
operator learning model. The material response is modeled as a solution
operator from the loading to the resultant displacement field, with the
material microstructure properties learned implicitly from the data and
naturally embedded in the network parameters. Using various combinations of
loading protocols, we compare the predictivity of this framework with finite
element analysis based on the phenomenological Fung-type model. From
in-distribution tests, the predictivity of our approach presents good
generalizability to different loading conditions and outperforms the
conventional constitutive modeling at approximately one order of magnitude.
When tested on out-of-distribution loading ratios, the neural operator learning
approach becomes less effective. To improve the generalizability of our
framework, we propose a physics-guided neural operator learning model via
imposing partial physics knowledge. This method is shown to improve the model's
extrapolative performance in the small-deformation regime. Our results
demonstrate that with sufficient data coverage and/or guidance from partial
physics constraints, the data-driven approach can be a more effective method

operating over aging channels, pilot spacing is crucial for acquiring channel
state information and achieving high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR). Somewhat surprisingly, very few works examine the impact of pilot
spacing on the correlation structure of subsequent channel estimates and the
resulting quality of channel state information considering channel aging. In
this paper, we consider a fast-fading environment characterized by its
exponentially decaying autocorrelation function, and model pilot spacing as a
sampling problem to capture the inherent trade-off between the quality of
channel state information and the number of symbols available for information
carrying data symbols. We first establish a quasi-closed form for the
achievable asymptotic deterministic equivalent SINR when the channel estimation
algorithm utilizes multiple pilot signals. Next, we establish upper bounds on
the achievable SINR and spectral efficiency, as a function of pilot spacing,
which helps to find the optimum pilot spacing within a limited search space.
Our key insight is that to maximize the achievable SINR and the spectral
efficiency of MU-MIMO systems, proper pilot spacing must be applied to control
the impact of the aging channel and to tune the trade-off between pilot and
data symbols.

Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) with autonomous vehicles

are capable of timely generating and transmitting a large amount of data.
However, these data can not be used for model training directly due to privacy
constraints. In this paper, we introduce a federated learning framework coping
with Hierarchical Heterogeneity (H2-Fed), which can notably enhance the
conventional pre-trained deep learning model. The framework exploits data from
connected public traffic agents in vehicular networks without affecting user
data privacy. By coordinating existing traffic infrastructure, including
roadside units and road traffic clouds, the model parameters are efficiently
disseminated by vehicular communications and hierarchically aggregated.
Considering the individual heterogeneity of data distribution, computational
and communication capabilities across traffic agents and roadside units, we
employ a novel method that addresses the heterogeneity of different aggregation
layers of the framework architecture, i.e., aggregation in layers of roadside
units and cloud. The experiment results indicate that our method can well
balance the learning accuracy and stability according to the knowledge of
heterogeneity in current communication networks. Comparing to other baseline
approaches, the evaluation on federated datasets shows that our framework is
more general and capable especially in application scenarios with low
communication quality. Even when 90% of the agents are timely disconnected, the
pre-trained deep learning model can still be forced to converge stably, and its
accuracy can be enhanced from 68% to over 90% after convergence.

sequential recommendation with a novel causal discovery module to capture
causalities among user behaviors. Our general idea is firstly assuming a causal
graph underlying item correlations, and then we learn the causal graph jointly
with the sequential recommender model by fitting the real user behavior data.
More specifically, in order to satisfy the causality requirement, the causal
graph is regularized by a differentiable directed acyclic constraint.
Considering that the number of items in recommender systems can be very large,
we represent different items with a unified set of latent clusters, and the
causal graph is defined on the cluster level, which enhances the model
scalability and robustness. In addition, we provide theoretical analysis on the
identifiability of the learned causal graph. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper makes a first step towards combining sequential recommendation with
causal discovery. For evaluating the recommendation performance, we implement
our framework with different neural sequential architectures, and compare them

affected by the dispersed particle phase for volume fraction above $10^{-4}$
and hence reverse coupling or two-way coupling becomes relevant in that volume
fraction regime. In a recent study by Muramulla $et.al.^1$, a discontinuous
decrease of turbulence intensity is observed in a vertical particle-laden
turbulent channel-flow for a critical volume fraction O($10^{-3}$). The
collapse of turbulent intensity is found out to be a result of catastrophic
reduction of turbulent energy production rate. Mechanistically, particle-fluid
coupling in particle-laden turbulent Couette-flow differs from that in a closed
channel flow. In this article, the turbulence modulation in Couette-flow by
inertial particles is explored through two-way coupled DNS where particle
volume fraction ($\phi$) is varied from $1.75\times10^{-4}$ to
$1.05\times10^{-3}$ and Reynolds Number based on half-channel width ($\delta$)
and wall velocity ($U$) ($Re_{\delta}$) is $750$. The particles are heavy point
particles with $St\sim367$ based on fluid integral time-scale represented by
$\delta/U$. A discontinuous decrease of fluid turbulence intensity, mean square
velocity and Reynolds stress is observed beyond a critical volume fraction
$\phi_{cr}\sim7.875\times10^{-4}$. The drastic reduction of shear production of
turbulence and in turn the reduction of viscous dissipation of turbulent
kinetic energy are two important phenomena for the occurrence of discontinuous
transition similar to channelflow. The step-wise particle injection and
step-wise removal study confirms that it is the presence of particles which is
majorly behind this discontinuous transition.

myosin, which require polar substrates for their function. Motivated by recent
experimental evidence of motor-independent contractility, we propose a robust
motor-free mechanism that can generate contraction in biopolymer networks
without the need for substrate polarity. We show that contractility is a
natural consequence of active binding/unbinding of crosslinkers that breaks the
Principle of Detailed Balance, together with the asymmetric force-extension
response of semiflexible biopolymers. We calculate the resulting contractile
velocity using both a simple coarse-grained model and a more detailed
microscopic model for a viscoelastic biopolymer network. Our model may provide
an explanation of recent reports of motor-independent contractility in cells.
Our results also suggest a mechanism for generating contractile forces in
synthetic active materials.

substrate is slid against a hard abrasive was first observed and documented by
Robert Hooke in the 17$^{th}$ century. Similar particles have subsequently been
observed in numerous other abrasion-type processes, ranging from grinding of
steels to sliding rock faults. The prevalent hypothesis, originally proposed by
Hooke, is that these particles are formed due to high local temperatures
between the abrasive and the substrate, resulting in melting, droplet ejection
and subsequent resolidification -- the melting-resolidification hypothesis. In
this work, we revisit this phenomenon using \emph{in situ} analysis of a model
steel-abrasive contact geometry, complemented by analytical calculations. It is
found that the temperature within the contact zone, for typical contact
conditions used, is far from the melting point and that spherical particles do
not form in the absence of oxygen. We thereby propose a modification of the
melting-resolidification hypothesis, involving an intermediate exothermic
oxidation stage, and provide quantitative evidence for each step of the
process. Our results have implications for a wide class of abrasive systems

different exotic shapes in nuclear structure studies at low energies. Recent
phenomenological studies suggest that collision of heavy nuclei with
$\alpha$-clustered carbon ($^{12}$C) at relativistic energies can lead to large
initial state anisotropies. This is expected to impact the final momentum
anisotropies of the produced particles significantly. The emission of
electromagnetic radiations is considered to be more sensitive to the initial
state compared to hadronic observables and thus photon observables are expected
to be affected by the initial clustered structure profoundly. In this work we
estimate the production and anisotropic flow of photons from most-central
collisions of triangular $\alpha$-clustered carbon and gold at $\sqrt{s_{\rm

results with those obtained from unclustered carbon and gold collisions. We
show that the thermal photon $v_3$ for most central collisions is significantly
large for the clustered case compared to the case with unclustered carbon,
whereas the elliptic flow parameter does not show much difference for the two
cases. In addition, the ratio of anisotropic flow coefficients is found to be a

in the volume fraction regime $\phi>10^{-4}$, showed a discontinuous decrease
of turbulence intensity beyond a critical volume fraction
$\phi_{cr}\sim7.875\times10^{-4}$. Due to the presence of high inertial
particles, the drastic reduction of shear production of turbulence is found to
be the main cause for the discontinuous attenuation of turbulence. In this
article, particle-phase statistics is explored. The two-way coupled DNS reveal
that the mean-square velocity profiles in cross-stream (y) and span-wise (z)
directions are flat and increase with $\phi$ as the higher frequency of
collision helps in transferring streamwise momentum to span-wise and
wall-normal directions. Whereas, streamwise fluctuations decrease and tend
become flatter with increase in loading. In the regime with $\phi>\phi_{cr}$,
the particle velocity fluctuations drive the fluid phase velocity fluctuations.
Additionally it is observed that one-way coupled DNS and Fluctuating Force
Simulation (FFS) [2] are capable to predict the particle phase statistics with
reasonable accuracy in the regime $\phi<\phi_{cr}$ where wall-particle
collision time and inter-particle collision time is lesser than viscous
relaxation time of the particles. For, $\phi>\phi_{cr}$, a significant error in
the prediction from one-way coupled DNS and FFS is observed due to the
limitation of FFS in capturing the turbulence attenuation and the change in
mean fluid velocity profile. A modified FFS model (M-FFS) is successfully
developed in this article with modified mean fluid velocity profile and
zero-diffusivity.

relaxation from unconfined states, and the bandwidth of the flux-line. Using
time-domain measurements, we probe transmon's relaxation from higher energy

the device used in the experiment, we find a resurgence time corresponding to

magnetic field structures in rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. These stars
are assumed to have gone through a prolonged accretion spin-up phase, begging
the question of what accretion flows onto stars with complex magnetic fields
would look like. We present results from a suite of GRMHD simulations of
accreting neutron stars for dipole, quadrupole, and quadrudipolar stellar field
geometries. This is a first step towards simulating realistic hotspot shapes in
a general relativistic framework to understand hotspot variability in accreting
millisecond pulsars. We find that the location and size of the accretion
columns resulting in hotspots changes significantly depending on initial
stellar field strength and geometry. We also find that the strongest
contributions to the stellar torque are from disk-connected fieldlines and the
pulsar wind, leading to spin-down in almost all of the parameter regime
explored here. We further analyze angular momentum transport in the accretion
disk due to large scale magnetic stresses, turbulent stresses, wind- and
compressible effects which we identify with convective motions. The disk
collimates the initial open stellar flux forming jets. For dipoles, the
disk-magnetosphere interaction can either enhance or reduce jet power compared
to the isolated case. However for quadrupoles, the disk always leads to an
enhanced net open flux making the jet power comparable to the dipolar case. We
discuss our results in the context of observed neutron star jets and provide a
viable mechanism to explain radio power both in the low- and high-magnetic
field case.

calculations of extended systems. The generalized Pipek-Mezey Wannier functions
exhibit appealing characteristics (e.g., reaching an optimal localization and
the separation of the $\sigma$-$\pi$ orbitals) when compared with other
schemes. However, when applied to giant nanoscale systems, the orbital
localization suffers from a large computational cost overhead when one is
interested in localized states in a small fragment of the system. Herein we
present a swift, efficient, and robust approach for obtaining regionally
localized orbitals of a subsystem within the generalized Pipek-Mezey scheme.
The proposed algorithm introduces a reduced workspace and sequentially exhausts
the entire orbital space until the convergence of the localization functional.
It tackles systems with $\sim$10000 electrons within 0.5 hours with no loss in
localization quality compared to the traditional approach. Regionally localized
orbitals with a higher extent of localization are obtained via judiciously
extending the subsystem's size. Exemplifying on large bulk and a 4-nm wide slab
of diamond with NV$^-$ center, we demonstrate the methodology and discuss how
the choice of the localization region affects the excitation energy of the
defect. Furthermore, we show how the sequential algorithm is easily extended to
stochastic methodologies that do not provide individual single-particle
eigenstates. It is thus a promising tool to obtain regionally localized states
for solving the electronic structure problems of a subsystem embedded in giant
condensed systems.

  Answering",,,,,"cs.CL cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) is an important branch of textual QA
which discovers answers for the given questions based on a large number of
unstructured documents. Effectively mining correct answers from the open-domain
sources still has a fair way to go. Existing OpenQA systems might suffer from
the issues of question complexity and ambiguity, as well as insufficient
background knowledge. Recently, conversational OpenQA is proposed to address
these issues with the abundant contextual information in the conversation.
Promising as it might be, there exist several fundamental limitations including
the inaccurate question understanding, the coarse ranking for passage
selection, and the inconsistent usage of golden passage in the training and
inference phases. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we propose a
framework with Multifaceted Improvements for Conversational open-domain
Question Answering (MICQA). Specifically, MICQA has three significant
advantages. First, the proposed KL-divergence based regularization is able to
lead to a better question understanding for retrieval and answer reading.
Second, the added post-ranker module can push more relevant passages to the top
placements and be selected for reader with a two-aspect constrains. Third, the
well designed curriculum learning strategy effectively narrows the gap between
the golden passage settings of training and inference, and encourages the
reader to find true answer without the golden passage assistance. Extensive
experiments conducted on the publicly available dataset OR-QuAC demonstrate the
superiority of MICQA over the state-of-the-art model in conversational OpenQA
task.

of dark galactic subhalos, which would appear as unidentified sources for
gamma-ray telescopes. In this work, we study the sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT
to extended subhalos using simulated data based on a realistic sky model. We
simulate spatial templates for a set of representative subhalos, whose
parameters were derived from our previous work with N-body cosmological
simulation data. We find that detecting an extended subhalo and finding an
unequivocal signal of angular extension requires, respectively, a flux 2 to 10
times larger than in the case of a point-like source. By studying a large grid
of models, where parameters such as the WIMP mass, annihilation channel or
subhalo model are varied significantly, we obtain the response of the LAT as a
function of the product of annihilation cross section times the J-factor.
Indeed, we show that spatial extension can be used as an additional filter to
reject subhalos candidates among the pool of unidentified LAT sources, as well
as a ""smoking gun"" for positive identification. For instance, typical angular
extensions of a few tenths of degree are expected for the considered scenarios.
Finally, we also study the impact of the obtained LAT sensitivity to such
extended subhalos on the achievable dark matter constraints, which are a few
times less constraining than comparable point-source limits.

partially-known. Specifically, we assume that there are some unknown regions,
for which the robot does not know their successor regions a priori unless it
reaches these regions physically. In contrast to the standard game-based
approach that optimizes the worst-case cost, in the paper, we propose to use
regret as a new metric for planning in such a partially-known environment. The
regret of a plan under a fixed but unknown environment is the difference
between the actual cost incurred and the best-response cost the robot could
have achieved if it realizes the actual environment with hindsight. We provide
an effective algorithm for finding an optimal plan that satisfies the LTL
specification while minimizing its regret. A case study on firefighting robots
is provided to illustrate the proposed framework. We argue that the new metric
is more suitable for the scenario of partially-known environment since it
captures the trade-off between the actual cost spent and the potential benefit
one may obtain for exploring an unknown region.

the aneutronic fusion of proton and boron-11 nuclei in the near future, making
use of latest-day laser technology and nano-structured materials. The aim of
the preprint quoted above is to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion energy
gain from the irradiation of an initially uncompressed target consisting of an
array of nano-wires, by a femto-second laser. This proposal is in apparent
contrast to text-book wisdom, which postulates - even for the fast-ignitor
concept, and a DT fuel mix - a target density about 1000 times that of solid
state. The novel, optimistic predictions of Ruhl and Korn are based, however,
not on rigorous estimates, but only on parametric dependencies, extrapolated
far beyond their conventional limits of validity. The authors invoke the
effects of self-arising magnetic fields to result in additional magnetic
confinement, but we show their model to contain intrinsic contradictions. The
conclusion from out note is that ultra-fast, high power lasers can be of use to
inertial fusion energy production only, if the intrinsic time-scale for fusion
reactions can be brought down to a level more commensurate with the Laser pulse
length. Involving magnetic fields does not change this basic limitation, as the
Alfv\'en time will be similar to the kinetic disintegration time. Given that
the fusion energy gain as function of particle energy has a maximum (for DT at
about 170 keV) overheating will not be helpful so that the required enhancement
of the fusion reaction rate can only be achieved by strong pre-compression of
the target.

online ads systems. One challenge for the CTR prediction task is to capture the
real interest of users from their clicked items, which is inherently biased by
presented positions of items, i.e., more front positions tend to obtain higher
CTR values. A popular line of existing works focuses on explicitly estimating
position bias by result randomization which is expensive and inefficient, or by
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) which relies heavily on the quality of the
propensity estimation. Another common solution is modeling position as features
during offline training and simply adopting fixed value or dropout tricks when
serving. However, training-inference inconsistency can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Furthermore, post-click information such as position values is
informative while less exploited in CTR prediction. This work proposes a simple
yet efficient knowledge distillation framework to alleviate the impact of
position bias and leverage position information to improve CTR prediction. We
demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on a real-world production

to describe the structural and electronic properties of relaxed TTG with the

($E_{tol}$) at a fixed $\theta$, while $E_{tol}$ first reaches a local maximum
and begins to drop with decreasing $\theta^{\prime}$ for $\theta^{\prime} <
\theta$. Some regions exhibit enhanced in-plane relaxation in the top and
bottom layers but suppressed relaxation in the middle layer and form a
hexagonal network with the moir\'{e}-of-moir\'{e} length scale. The stacking

the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm follow from

be a new phenomenon in the theory of random walks on compact groups. In

inference studies requires building a surrogate model from the simulation
outputs to use in algorithms requiring sampling. In this work, we present
KilonovaNet, an implementation of conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs)
for the construction of surrogate models of kilonova spectra. This method can
be trained on spectra directly, removing overhead time of pre-processing
spectra, and greatly speeds up parameter inference time. We build surrogate
models of three state-of-the-art kilonova simulation data sets and present
in-depth surrogate error evaluation methods, which can in general be applied to
any surrogate construction method. By creating synthetic photometric
observations from the spectral surrogate, we perform parameter inference for
the observed light curve data of GW170817 and compare the results with previous
analyses. Given the speed with which KilonovaNet performs during parameter
inference, it will serve as a useful tool in future gravitational wave
observing runs to quickly analyze potential kilonova candidates

understanding of the interplay of critical phenomena and the nonequilibrium
dynamics of the rapidly expanding fireball. We study these aspects with a fluid
dynamic expansion coupled to the explicit propagation of the chiral order
parameter sigma via a Langevin equation. Assuming a sigma-proton coupling
through an effective proton mass, we relate cumulants of the order parameter
and the net-proton number at freeze-out and obtain observable cumulant ratios
as a function of beam energy. We emphasize the role of the nonequilibrium
first-order phase transition where a mixed phase with gradual freeze-out can
significantly alter the cumulants. We find that the presence of a critical end
point is clearly visible in the cumulant ratios for a relatively wide range of
center-of-mass energies.

an intelligent agent to move from any situation it finds itself in to one that
satisfies its goals. Classical planning is considered domain-independent, i.e.,
it is not limited to a particular application and can be used to solve
different types of reasoning problems. In practice, however, some properties of
a planning problem at hand require an expressive extension of the standard
classical planning formalism to capture and model them. Although the importance
of many of these extensions is well known, most planners, especially optimal
planners, do not support these extended planning formalisms. The lack of
support not only limits the use of these planners for certain problems, but
even if it is possible to model the problems without these extensions, it often
leads to increased effort in modeling or makes modeling practically impossible
as the required problem encoding size increases exponentially.
  In this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for cost-optimal planning
for different expressive extensions of classical planning, all capturing
different aspects of the problem. In particular, we study planning with axioms,
planning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription planning, and
top-k planning. For all formalisms, we present complexity and compilability
results, highlighting that it is desirable and even necessary to natively
support the corresponding features. We analyze symbolic heuristic search and
show that the search performance does not always benefit from the use of a
heuristic and that the search performance can exponentially deteriorate even
under the best possible circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic. This
reinforces that symbolic blind search is the dominant symbolic search strategy
nowadays, on par with other state-of-the-art cost-optimal planning
strategies...

generally employ a set of training tasks from other domains to assist the
target task, where the distribution between assistant tasks and the target task
is usually different. To reduce the distribution gap, several lines of methods
have been proposed, such as data augmentation and domain alignment. However,
one common drawback of these algorithms is that they ignore the similarity task
selection before training. The fundamental problem is to push the auxiliary
tasks close to the target task. In this paper, we propose a novel task
selecting algorithm, named Optimal Transport Task Selecting (OTTS), to
construct a training set by selecting similar tasks for Few-Shot learning.
Specifically, the OTTS measures the task similarity by calculating the optimal
transport distance and completes the model training via a self-supervised
strategy. By utilizing the selected tasks with OTTS, the training process of
Few-Shot learning become more stable and effective. Other proposed methods
including data augmentation and domain alignment can be used in the meantime
with OTTS. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including
MiniImageNet, CIFAR, CUB, Cars, and Places, to evaluate the effectiveness of
OTTS. Experimental results validate that our OTTS outperforms the typical
baselines, i.e., MAML, matchingnet, protonet, by a large margin (averagely
1.72\% accuracy improvement).

valuable intellectual property (IP) as many hours are invested in their

hardware obfuscation, including the widely studied logic locking technique, are
insufficient to protect the actual IP of a well-trained NN: its weights. Simply
hiding the weights behind a key-based scheme is inefficient (resource-hungry)

proposes an intuitive method to poison the predictions that prevent
distillation-based attacks; this is the first work to consider such a poisoning
approach in hardware-implemented NNs. The proposed technique obfuscates a NN so
an attacker cannot train the NN entirely or accurately. We elaborate a threat
model which highlights the difference between random logic obfuscation and the
obfuscation of NN IP. Based on this threat model, our security analysis shows
that the poisoning successfully and significantly reduces the accuracy of the
stolen NN model on various representative datasets. Moreover, the accuracy and

high overheads incurred. Finally, we highlight that our proposed approach is

are central to accountable decision making. Actual causality focuses on
specific outcomes and aims to identify decisions (actions) that were critical
in realizing an outcome of interest. Responsibility attribution is
complementary and aims to identify the extent to which decision makers (agents)
are responsible for this outcome. In this paper, we study these concepts under
a widely used framework for multi-agent sequential decision making under
uncertainty: decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes
(Dec-POMDPs). Following recent works in RL that show correspondence between
POMDPs and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we first establish a connection
between Dec-POMDPs and SCMs. This connection enables us to utilize a language
for describing actual causality from prior work and study existing definitions
of actual causality in Dec-POMDPs. Given that some of the well-known
definitions may lead to counter-intuitive actual causes, we introduce a novel
definition that more explicitly accounts for causal dependencies between
agents' actions. We then turn to responsibility attribution based on actual
causality, where we argue that in ascribing responsibility to an agent it is
important to consider both the number of actual causes in which the agent
participates, as well as its ability to manipulate its own degree of
responsibility. Motivated by these arguments we introduce a family of
responsibility attribution methods that extends prior work, while accounting
for the aforementioned considerations. Finally, through a simulation-based
experiment, we compare different definitions of actual causality and
responsibility attribution methods. The empirical results demonstrate the
qualitative difference between the considered definitions of actual causality

belong to the bagging or boosting. However, no previous work has ever built the
ensemble classifier by maximizing long-term returns to the best of our
knowledge. This paper proposes a decision forest building method called
MA-H-SAC-DF for binary classification via deep reinforcement learning. First,
the building process is modeled as a decentralized partial observable Markov
decision process, and a set of cooperative agents jointly constructs all base
classifiers. Second, the global state and local observations are defined based
on informations of the parent node and the current location. Last, the
state-of-the-art deep reinforcement method Hybrid SAC is extended to a
multi-agent system under the CTDE architecture to find an optimal decision
forest building policy. The experiments indicate that MA-H-SAC-DF has the same
performance as random forest, Adaboost, and GBDT on balanced datasets and
outperforms them on imbalanced datasets.

  for Ordinal Regression","The first two authors contributed equally to this work. Accepted to
  CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning from a label distribution has achieved promising results on ordinal
regression tasks such as facial age and head pose estimation wherein, the
concept of adaptive label distribution learning (ALDL) has drawn lots of
attention recently for its superiority in theory. However, compared with the
methods assuming fixed form label distribution, ALDL methods have not achieved
better performance. We argue that existing ALDL algorithms do not fully exploit
the intrinsic properties of ordinal regression. In this paper, we emphatically
summarize that learning an adaptive label distribution on ordinal regression
tasks should follow three principles. First, the probability corresponding to
the ground-truth should be the highest in label distribution. Second, the
probabilities of neighboring labels should decrease with the increase of
distance away from the ground-truth, i.e., the distribution is unimodal. Third,
the label distribution should vary with samples changing, and even be distinct
for different instances with the same label, due to the different levels of
difficulty and ambiguity. Under the premise of these principles, we propose a
novel loss function for fully adaptive label distribution learning, namely
unimodal-concentrated loss. Specifically, the unimodal loss derived from the
learning to rank strategy constrains the distribution to be unimodal.
Furthermore, the estimation error and the variance of the predicted
distribution for a specific sample are integrated into the proposed
concentrated loss to make the predicted distribution maximize at the
ground-truth and vary according to the predicting uncertainty. Extensive
experimental results on typical ordinal regression tasks including age and head
pose estimation, show the superiority of our proposed unimodal-concentrated
loss compared with existing loss functions.

is reduced to a finite set of controllers. When ellipsoidal cells and affine

which can be seen as a model of hybrid zones in population genetics.
Individuals in the population can be of one of three types; $aa$ are fitter
than $AA$, and both are fitter than the $aA$ heterozygotes. The hybrid zone is
the region separating a subpopulation consisting entirely of $aa$ individuals
from one consisting of $AA$ individuals. We investigate the interplay between
the motion of the hybrid zone and the shape of the habitat, both with and
without genetic drift (corresponding to stochastic and deterministic models
respectively). In the deterministic model, we investigate the effect of a wide
opening and provide some explicit sufficient conditions under which the spread
of the advantageous type is halted, and complementary conditions under which it
sweeps through the whole population. As a standing example, we are interested
in the outcome of the advantageous population passing through an isthmus. We
also identify rather precise conditions under which genetic drift breaks down
the structure of the hybrid zone, complementing previous work that identified
conditions on the strength of genetic drift under which the structure of the
hybrid zone is preserved.
  Our results demonstrate that, even in cylindrical domains, it can be
misleading to caricature allele frequencies by one-dimensional travelling
waves, and that the strength of genetic drift plays an important role in
determining the fate of a favoured allele.

obtained by construction probability amplitudes, thus implying unitary
evolution of the measured system, broken each time a measurement is made. In
practice, the experimenter needs to know all past outcomes at the end of the
experiment, and that requires the presence of probes carrying the corresponding
records. In this picture a composite system+probes can be seen to undergo an
unbroken unitary evolution until the end of the trial, where the state of the
probes is examined. For these two descriptions to agree one requires a
particular type of coupling between a probe and the system, which we discuss in
some details. With this in mind, we consider two different ways to extend the
description of a quantum system's past beyond what is actually measured and
recorded. One is to look for quantities whose values can be ascertained without
altering the existing probabilities. Such ""elements of reality"" can be found,
yet they suffer from the same drawback as their EPR counterparts. The probes
designed to measure non-commuting operators frustrate each other if set up to
work jointly, so no simultaneous values of such quantities can be established
consistently. The other possibility is to investigate the system's response to
weekly coupled probes. Such weak probes are shown either to reduce to a small
fraction the number of cases where the corresponding values are still
accurately measured, or lead only to the evaluation of the system's probability
amplitudes, or their combinations. It is difficult, we conclude, to see in
quantum mechanics anything other than a formalism for predicting the
likelihoods of the recorded outcomes of actually performed observations.

in a superposition state of two paths. The evolution of objects is described by
the completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map with a
population-preserving property. This property reflects that the probability of
objects being on each path is preserved. We use the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence
to quantify the coherence of objects. In the present paper, the quantum nature
of gravity is characterized by an entangling map, which is a CPTP map with the
capacity to create entanglement. We introduce the entangling-map witness as an
observable to test whether a given map is entangling. We show that, whenever
the gravitating objects initially have a finite amount of the $\ell_1$-norm of
coherence, the witness tests the entangling map due to gravity. Interestingly,
we find that the witness can test such a quantum nature of gravity, even when
the objects do not get entangled. This means that the coherence of gravitating
objects always becomes the source of the entangling map due to gravity. We
further discuss a decoherence effect and an experimental perspective in the
present approach.

penetrable object with compact support is considered. By representing the
scattered field as a volume potential in terms of the Green's function, we
arrive at the Lippmann-Schwinger equation in integral form, which is then
discretized using an appropriate quadrature technique. The discretized linear
system is then solved using an iterative solver accelerated by Directional
Algebraic Fast Multipole Method (DAFMM). The DAFMM presented here relies on the
directional admissibility condition of the 2D Helmholtz kernel. And the
construction of low-rank factorizations of the appropriate low-rank matrix
sub-blocks is based on our new Nested Cross Approximation (NCA)~\cite{
arXiv:2203.14832 [math.NA]}. The advantage of our new NCA is that the search
space of so-called far-field pivots is smaller than that of the existing NCAs.
Another significant contribution of this work is the use of HODLR based direct
solver as a preconditioner to further accelerate the iterative solver. In one
of our numerical experiments, the iterative solver does not converge without a
preconditioner. We show that the HODLR preconditioner is capable of solving
problems that the iterative solver can not. Another noteworthy contribution of
this article is that we perform a comparative study of the HODLR based fast
direct solver, DAFMM based fast iterative solver, and HODLR preconditioned
DAFMM based fast iterative solver for the discretized Lippmann-Schwinger
problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first to provide
a systematic study and comparison of these different solvers for various
problem sizes and contrast functions. In the spirit of reproducible

  Recommendations",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cold-start issues have been more and more challenging for providing accurate
recommendations with the fast increase of users and items. Most existing
approaches attempt to solve the intractable problems via content-aware
recommendations based on auxiliary information and/or cross-domain
recommendations with transfer learning. Their performances are often
constrained by the extremely sparse user-item interactions, unavailable side
information, or very limited domain-shared users. Recently, meta-learners with
meta-augmentation by adding noises to labels have been proven to be effective
to avoid overfitting and shown good performance on new tasks. Motivated by the
idea of meta-augmentation, in this paper, by treating a user's preference over
items as a task, we propose a so-called Diverse Preference Augmentation
framework with multiple source domains based on meta-learning (referred to as
MetaDPA) to i) generate diverse ratings in a new domain of interest (known as
target domain) to handle overfitting on the case of sparse interactions, and to
ii) learn a preference model in the target domain via a meta-learning scheme to
alleviate cold-start issues. Specifically, we first conduct multi-source domain
adaptation by dual conditional variational autoencoders and impose a
Multi-domain InfoMax (MDI) constraint on the latent representations to learn
domain-shared and domain-specific preference properties. To avoid overfitting,
we add a Mutually-Exclusive (ME) constraint on the output of decoders to
generate diverse ratings given content data. Finally, these generated diverse
ratings and the original ratings are introduced into the meta-training
procedure to learn a preference meta-learner, which produces good
generalization ability on cold-start recommendation tasks. Experiments on
real-world datasets show our proposed MetaDPA clearly outperforms the current
state-of-the-art baselines.

Lagrangian insertion (normalized by the Wilson loop without insertion) in

closely related to the Amplituhedron, and it is reminiscent of finite parts of
planar two-loop five-particle scattering amplitudes. We verify that, up to this
loop order, the leading singularities are given by the same conformally
invariant expressions that appear in all-plus pure Yang-Mills amplitudes. The
accompanying weight-four transcendental functions are expressed in terms of the
pentagon functions space known from planar two-loop five-particle amplitudes,
but interestingly only a subset of the functions appears. Being a function of
four dimensionless variables, the observable has interesting asymptotic limits.
We verify that our analytic result is consistent with soft and collinear
limits, and find an intriguingly simple pattern in the multi-Regge limit.
Thanks to the new result we can also conjecturally predict, for general
kinematics, the maximal weight piece of the planar three-loop five-particle
all-plus amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory. Motivated by the Amplituhedron
geometry, we investigate positivity properties of the integrated answer.
Generalizing previous results at four particles, we find numerical evidence
that the two-loop five-particle result has uniform sign in a kinematic region

sensor information and communication technologies to support decision making,
proactively and near real-time. Among available technologies to monitor
foraging behavior, the acoustic method has been highly reliable and repeatable,
but can be subject to further computational improvements to increase precision
and specificity of recognition of foraging activities. In this study, an
algorithm called Jaw Movement segment-based Foraging Activity Recognizer
(JMFAR) is proposed. The method is based on the computation and analysis of
temporal, statistical and spectral features of jaw movement sounds for
detection of rumination and grazing bouts. They are called JM-segment features
because they are extracted from a sound segment and expect to capture JM
information of the whole segment rather than individual JMs. Two variants of
the method are proposed and tested: (i) the temporal and statistical features
only JMFAR-ns; and (ii) a feature selection process (JMFAR-sel). The JMFAR was
tested on signals registered in a free grazing environment, achieving an
average weighted F1-score of 93%. Then, it was compared with a state-of-the-art
algorithm, showing improved performance for estimation of grazing bouts (+19%).
The JMFAR-ns variant reduced the computational cost by 25.4%, but achieved a
slightly lower performance than the JMFAR. The good performance and low
computational cost of JMFAR-ns supports the feasibility of using this algorithm
variant for real-time implementation in low-cost embedded systems. The method

the penalty method. Unlike pointwise (node-to-surface or point-to-surface)
contact algorithms in the Galerkin framework, the CCS formulation passes the
contact patch test to machine precision by naturally exploiting the favorable
properties of isogeometric collocation. Compared with approaches where the
discretization of both bulk and contact surfaces is based on collocation, the
CCS approach does not need enhancements to remove oscillations for highly
non-uniform meshes. With respect to integral contact approaches, the CCS
algorithm is less expensive, easier to code and can be added to a pre-existing
isogeometric analysis code with minimal effort. Numerical examples in both
small and large deformations are investigated to compare the CCS approach with
some available contact formulations and to demonstrate its accuracy.

spectra taken during the CARMENES project. They reveal a relation between
average field strength, <B>, and Rossby number, $Ro$, resembling the
well-studied rotation-activity relation. Among the slowly rotating stars, we
find that magnetic flux, $\Phi_\textrm{B}$, is proportional to rotation period,
$P$, and among the rapidly rotating stars that average surface fields do not
grow significantly beyond the level set by the available kinetic energy.
Furthermore, we find close relations between nonthermal coronal X-ray emission,
chromospheric H$\alpha$ and Ca H&K emission, and magnetic flux. Taken together,
these relations demonstrate empirically that the rotation-activity relation can
be traced back to a dependence of the magnetic dynamo on rotation. We advocate
the picture that the magnetic dynamo generates magnetic flux on the stellar
surface proportional to rotation rate with a saturation limit set by the
available kinetic energy, and we provide relations for average field strengths
and nonthermal emission that are independent of the choice of the convective
turnover time. We also find that Ca H&K emission saturates at average field
strengths of $\langle B \rangle \approx 800$ G while H$\alpha$ and X-ray
emission grow further with stronger fields in the more rapidly rotating stars.
This is in conflict with the coronal stripping scenario predicting that in the
most rapidly rotating stars coronal plasma would be cooled to chromospheric
temperatures.

the Loudon-Fleury mechanism, we find one and only Raman-active mode of
$\mathrm{E}_2$ symmetry without any dependence on linear incident and scattered
polarizations. Beyond the Loudon-Fleury mechanism, two more symmetry species
$\mathrm{A}_1$ and $\mathrm{A}_2$ are activated via dynamic ring exchange and
chiral spin fluctuations, respectively, which can be extracted by the use of
circular as well as linear polarizations. We employ Green's functions on one
hand and configuration-interaction wavefunctions on the other hand to calculate
the multimagnon contributions to inelastic light scatterings. Demonstrating the
great advantage of the configuration-interaction scheme, we reveal that a major
portion of the Shastry-Shraiman fourth-order Raman intensity is mediated by
multimagnon fluctuations.

an orbiting secondary star. The most secure method we have for determining if
the compact object is a black hole is to determine its mass: this is limited to
bright objects, and requires substantial time-intensive spectroscopic
monitoring. With new X-ray sources being discovered with different X-ray
observatories, developing efficient, robust means to classify compact objects
becomes increasingly important. We compare three machine learning
classification methods (Bayesian Gaussian Processes (BGP), K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM)) for determining the compact objects as
neutron stars or black holes (BHs) in XRB systems. Each machine learning method
uses spatial patterns which exist between systems of the same type in 3D
Color-Color-Intensity diagrams. We used lightcurves extracted using six years
of data with MAXI/GSC for 44 representative sources. We find that all three
methods are highly accurate in distinguishing pulsing from non-pulsing neutron
stars (NPNS) with 95\% of NPNS and 100\% of pulsars accurately predicted. All
three methods have high accuracy distinguishing BHs from pulsars (92\%) but
continue to confuse BHs with a subclass of NPNS, called the Bursters, with KNN
doing the best at only 50\% accuracy for predicting BHs. The precision of all
three methods is high, providing equivalent results over 5-10 independent runs.
In a future work, we suggest a fourth dimension be incorporated to mitigate the
confusion of BHs with Bursters. This work paves the way towards more robust
methods to efficiently distinguish BHs, NPNS, and pulsars.

Homogeneous and heterogeneous heat pump loads are generated using
population-weighted average and local temperature, respectively, assuming
complete residential heat pump penetration. The results of a storage and
generation optimal expansion model with network effects for spatiotemporally
homogeneous and heterogeneous load profiles are compared. A case study is
performed using a 3-bus network of London, Manchester, and Glasgow in Britain
for load and weather data for representative weeks. Using heterogeneous heating
demand data changes storage sizing: under a business-as-usual budget, 26% more
total storage is built on an energy and power basis, and this storage is
distributed among all of the buses in the heterogeneous case. Under a
low-carbon budget, total energy storage at all buses increases 2 times on an
energy basis and 40% on a power basis. The energy to power ratio of storage at
each bus also increases when accounting for heterogeneity; this change suggests
that storage will be needed to provide energy support in addition to power
support for electric heating in high-renewable power systems. Accounting for
heterogeneity also increases modeled systems costs, particularly capital costs,
because of the need for higher generation capacity in the largest load center
and coincidence of local peak demand at different buses. These results show the
importance of accounting for heat pump load heterogeneity in power system
planning.

faster prediction than state-of-the-art methods and works efficiently on
consecutive dense point clouds of more than 250K points at once. Our

color-superconducting phase to an ungapped quark-matter phase when the density
is increased. Such a phase transition is found to be absent in
isospin-symmetric matter. Moreover, by taking into account constraints from
$\beta$-equilibrium, charge neutrality, and color neutrality, we provide an
estimate for the speed of sound in neutron-star matter. Notably, we observe
that the speed of sound in neutron-star matter exceeds the asymptotic value
associated with the noninteracting quark gas and even increases towards lower
densities across a wide range, in agreement with recent results for
isospin-symmetric matter. Considering results from studies based on chiral
effective field theory at low densities, our findings suggest the existence of

elusive polymorph of [Fe(Pyrz)2] (tetragonal phase) over graphene is developed
that allows us to electrically detect a fast and effective light-induced spin

enhanced even more when a flexible polymeric layer of PMMA is inserted in

of defocus blur. While deep learning approach shows great promise in solving
image restoration problems, defocus deblurring demands accurate training data
that consists of all-in-focus and defocus image pairs, which is difficult to
collect. Naive two-shot capturing cannot achieve pixel-wise correspondence
between the defocused and all-in-focus image pairs. Synthetic aperture of light
fields is suggested to be a more reliable way to generate accurate image pairs.
However, the defocus blur generated from light field data is different from
that of the images captured with a traditional digital camera. In this paper,
we propose a novel deep defocus deblurring network that leverages the strength
and overcomes the shortcoming of light fields. We first train the network on a
light field-generated dataset for its highly accurate image correspondence.
Then, we fine-tune the network using feature loss on another dataset collected
by the two-shot method to alleviate the differences between the defocus blur

able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and
qualitatively on multiple test sets. Extensive ablation studies have been
conducted to analyze the effect of each network module to the final

a sample of 45 nonpolar CHs during the minimum phase of solar cycle 24. The aim
is to understand how CHs of different properties influence the HSS peak speeds
observed at Earth and draw from this to improve solar wind modeling. The
characteristics of the CHs of our sample were extracted based on the Collection
of Analysis Tools for Coronal Holes (CATCH) which employs an intensity
threshold technique applied to extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) filtergrams. We first
examined all the correlations between the geometric characteristics of the CHs
and the HSS peak speed and duration at Earth, for the entire sample. The CHs
were then categorized in different groups based on morphological criteria, such
as the aspect ratio, the orientation angle and the geometric complexity, a
parameter which is often neglected when the formation of the fast solar wind at
Earth is studied. Our results, confirmed also by the bootstrapping technique,
show that all three aforementioned morphological criteria play a major role in
determining the HSS peak speed at 1 AU. Therefore, they need to be taken into
consideration for empirical models that aim to forecast the fast solar wind at

fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and offers high flexibility concerning the
solvers employed for the two subproblems. Nevertheless, it is not without
shortcomings: to begin with, the inherent added-mass effect often destabilizes
the numerical solution severely. Moreover, the Dirichlet-Neumann scheme cannot
be applied to FSI problems in which an incompressible fluid is fully enclosed
by Dirichlet boundaries, as it is incapable of satisfying the volume
constraint. In the last decade, interface quasi-Newton methods have proven to
control the added-mass effect and substantially speed up convergence by adding
a Newton-like update step to the Dirichlet-Neumann coupling. They are, however,
without effect on the incompressibility dilemma. As an alternative, the
Robin-Neumann scheme generalizes the fluid's boundary condition to a Robin
condition by including the Cauchy stresses. While this modification in fact
successfully tackles both drawbacks of the Dirichlet-Neumann approach, the
price to be paid is a strong dependency on the Robin weighting parameter, with
very limited a priori knowledge about good choices. This work proposes a
strategy to merge these two ideas and benefit from their combined strengths.
The resulting quasi-Newton-accelerated Robin-Neumann scheme is compared to both
Robin- and Dirichlet-Neumann variants. The numerical tests demonstrate that it
does not only provide faster convergence, but also massively reduces the
influence of the Robin parameter, mitigating the main drawback of the
Robin-Neumann algorithm.

123000 $L_{\odot}$, which is reported in the literature as being consistent
with the Hipparcos distance to Rigel. However, due to the lack of consensus on
Rigel's luminosity, we also explore how the adoption of the stellar luminosity

support, in an independent way, the distance to Rigel as the one provided by
the Hipparcos mission, when taking the luminosity of 123000 $L_{\odot}$ at face

extracting it due to the no-cloning theorem. For large scramblers, we supply
analytical formulas for the optimal hacking fidelity, a quantitative measure of
the effectiveness of scrambler hacking with limited access. In the two-user
scenario where Bob attempts to hack Alice's data, we find that the optimal
fidelity converges to $64/(9\pi^2)\approx0.72$ with increasing Bob's hacking
space relative to Alice's user space. We applied our results to the black hole

of performance is inevitable under cross-dataset settings, suffering from
domain shift. In consideration of real-world applications, a small number of
bonafide samples are easily accessible. We thus define a new domain adaptation

frequency information. Specifically, our method integrates frequency-related
information through two proposed modules. Frequency-based Attention Module

emphasizes high-frequency fine-grained features. Frequency Mixing Module (FMM)
mixes certain frequency components to generate large-scale target-style samples

real counterparts is an important challenge for reducing costs and increasing
safety in machine learning. In this work, we focus on autoencoder architectures
and aim at learning latent space representations that are invariant to
inductive biases caused by the domain shift between simulated and real images
showing the same scenario. We train on synthetic images only, present
approaches to increase generalizability and improve the preservation of the
semantics to real datasets of increasing visual complexity. We show that
pre-trained feature extractors (e.g. VGG) can be sufficient for generalization
on images of lower complexity, but additional improvements are required for
visually more complex scenes. To this end, we demonstrate a new sampling
technique, which matches semantically important parts of the image, while
randomizing the other parts, leads to salient feature extraction and a
neglection of unimportant parts. This helps the generalization to real data and
we further show that our approach outperforms fine-tuned classification models.

causality from data. Recently, the problem has been formulated into a
continuous optimization framework with an acyclicity constraint, allowing for
the exploration of deep generative models to better capture data sample
distributions and support the discovery of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that
faithfully represent the underlying data distribution. However, so far no study
has investigated the use of Wasserstein distance for causal structure learning
via generative models. This paper proposes a new model named DAG-WGAN, which
combines the Wasserstein-based adversarial loss, an auto-encoder architecture
together with an acyclicity constraint. DAG-WGAN simultaneously learns causal
structures and improves its data generation capability by leveraging the
strength from the Wasserstein distance metric. Compared with other models, it
scales well and handles both continuous and discrete data. Our experiments have
evaluated DAG-WGAN against the state-of-the-art and demonstrated its good

pression to predict events ahead of time with as much accuracy as possible
while not delaying the decision unduly. This translates in the optimization of
a trade-off between earliness and accuracy of the decisions, that has been the
subject of research for time series of finite length and with a unique label.
And this has led to powerful algorithms for Early Classification of Time Series
(ECTS). This paper, for the first time, investigates such a trade-off when
events of different classes occur in a streaming fashion, with no predefined
end. In the Early Classification in Open Time Series problem (ECOTS), the task
is to predict events, i.e. their class and time interval, at the moment that
optimizes the accuracy vs. earliness trade-off. Interestingly, we find that
ECTS algorithms can be sensibly adapted in a principled way to this new

that this new approach opens up, we develop a predictive maintenance use case

proposed as a possible alternative to the standard $^{nat}$Cr($p$,x)$^{52g}$Mn
one, but improvements in the modeling were needed to better compare the two
production routes.
  Purpose: This work focuses on the development of precise simulations and
models to compare the $^{52g}$Mn production from both reactions in terms of
amount of activity and radionuclidic purity (RNP), as well as in terms of dose
increase (DI) due to the co-produced radioactive contaminants, with respect to
a pure $^{52g}$MnCl$_2$ injection.
  Methods: The nuclear code Talys has been employed to optimize the
$^{nat}$V($\alpha$,x)$^{52g}$Mn cross section by tuning the parameters of the
microscopic level densities. Dosimetric assessments of [$^{xx}$Mn]Cl$_2$ have
been accomplished with OLINDA software 2.2.0 using female and male phantoms. At
the end, the yield of $^{xx}$Mn radioisotopes estimated for the two production
routes have been combined with the dosimetric results, to assess the DI at
different times after the end of the irradiation.
  Results: Good agreement was obtained between cross sections calculations and
measurements. The comparison of the two reaction channels suggests that
$^{nat}$V($\alpha$,x)$^{52g}$Mn leads to higher yield and higher purity,
resulting in a less harmful impact on patients' health in terms of DI.
  Conclusions: Both $^{nat}$V($\alpha$,x) and $^{nat}$Cr($p$,x) production
routes provide clinically acceptable $^{52g}$MnCl$_2$ for PET imaging. However,
the $^{nat}$V($\alpha$,x)$^{52g}$Mn reaction provides a DI systematically lower
than the one obtainable with $^{nat}$Cr($p$,x)$^{52g}$Mn and a longer time
window in which it can be used clinically (RNP $\ge$ 99\%).

model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually
removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a
smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly
reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation.
However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are
expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning
method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly
parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both
accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight
is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads
and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each
parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise
distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models
during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi
yields models with over 10x speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its
effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation
approaches.

Kauffman bracket skein module of the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, KBSM($L(p,q)$), for
$q\neq 0$. For doing this, we introduce a new concept, that of an {\it
unoriented braid}. Unoriented braids are obtained from standard braids by
ignoring the natural top-to-bottom orientation of the strands. We first define
the {\it generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra of type B}, $TL_{1, n}$, which is
related to the knot theory of the solid torus ST, and we obtain the universal
Kauffman bracket type invariant, $V$, for knots and links in ST, via a unique
Markov trace constructed on $TL_{1, n}$. The universal invariant $V$ is
equivalent to the KBSM(ST). For passing now to the KBSM($L(p,q)$), we impose on
$V$ relations coming from the band moves (or slide moves), that is, moves that
reflect isotopy in $L(p,q)$ but not in ST, and which reflect the surgery
description of $L(p,q)$, obtaining thus, an infinite system of equations. By
construction, solving this infinite system of equations is equivalent to
computing KBSM($L(p,q)$). We first present the solution for the case $q=1$,
which corresponds to obtaining a new basis, $\mathcal{B}_{p}$, for
KBSM($L(p,1)$) with $(\lfloor p/2 \rfloor +1)$ elements. We note that the basis
$\mathcal{B}_{p}$ is different from the one obtained by Hoste \& Przytycki. For
dealing with the complexity of the infinite system for the case $q>1$, we first
show how the new basis $\mathcal{B}_{p}$ of KBSM($L(p,1)$) can be obtained
using a diagrammatic approach based on unoriented braids, and we finally extend

A simulation of virtual power plants with physical models and actual

synthetic time series are based exclusively on weather measurements, possible

current approaches to forecasting the RF are complex and computationally

problem, we propose a BN approach and describe ways to improve parameter

considered, and the best ones were used. The approaches of structure and
parameter learning, data discretization and normalization, subsampling on
analogues of the target reservoir, clustering of networks and data filtering
were considered. Finally, a physical model of a synthetic oil reservoir was
used to validate BNs' predictions of the RF. All approaches to modelling based
on BNs provide full coverage of the confidence interval for the RF predicted by
the physical model, but at the same time require less time and data for
modelling, which demonstrates the possibility of using in the early stages of
reservoirs development. The main result of the work can be considered the
development of a methodology for studying the parameters of reservoirs based on
Bayesian networks built on small amounts of data and with minimal involvement
of expert knowledge. The methodology was tested on the example of the problem

increases by a large amount around 2.8 kpc, due to dark clouds associated to
the Scutum-Crux arm. As a consequence, we hardly see any stars at distances
comparable to that of the cluster. The proper motions of Wd 1, however, are
very similar to those of stars in the field surrounding it, but distinct. We
find a second, astrometrically well-defined population in the foreground

is very elongated, an effect not driven by the very heavy extinction to the
East and South. We find a low-density halo extending up to 10' from the cluster
centre, mainly in the NW quadrant. A few OB stars at larger distances from the

Wd 1 has little or no peculiar motion with respect to the field population of

belong to an extended population related to the cluster, although we observe
several dozen such objects in the foreground. We find a substantial population

to push performance further, it is therefore crucial to account for noise when
performing the identification. To address this problem, this paper proposes the
use of a forward system identification using (PG)NNs from noisy data.
Afterwards, two methods are proposed for inverting PGNNs to design a
feedforward controller for high-precision motion control. The developed
methodology is validated on a real-life industrial linear motor, where it
showed significant improvements in tracking performance with respect to the
direct inverse identification.

generalization ability on speaker characteristics, which brings modeling
challenges. In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 4, a zero-shot adaptive TTS
system for high-quality speech synthesis. We model the speaker characteristics
systematically to improve the generalization on new speakers. Generally, the
modeling of speaker characteristics can be categorized into three steps:
extracting speaker representation, taking this speaker representation as
condition, and synthesizing speech/mel-spectrogram given this speaker
representation. Accordingly, we improve the modeling in three steps: 1) To
extract speaker representation with better generalization, we factorize the
speaker characteristics into basis vectors and extract speaker representation
by weighted combining of these basis vectors through attention. 2) We leverage
conditional layer normalization to integrate the extracted speaker
representation to TTS model. 3) We propose a novel supervision loss based on
the distribution of basis vectors to maintain the corresponding speaker
characteristics in generated mel-spectrograms. Without any fine-tuning,
AdaSpeech 4 achieves better voice quality and similarity than baselines in

with circumstellar material (CSM) should be universal in core-collapse

typically encountered in Type IIn SNe, we investigate the diverse long-term
radiative signatures of interaction between a Type II SN ejecta and CSM
corresponding to mass loss rates up to 10$^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Because
these CSM are relatively tenuous and optically-thin to electron-scattering
beyond a few stellar radii, radiation hydrodynamics is not essential and one
may treat the interaction directly as an additional power source in the
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer problem. The CSM
accumulated since shock breakout forms a dense shell in the outer ejecta and
leads to high-velocity absorption features in spectral lines, even for
negligible shock power. Besides Balmer lines, such features may appear in NaID,
HeI lines etc. A stronger interaction strengthens the continuum flux
(preferentially in the UV), quenches the absorption of P-Cygni profiles, boosts
the MgII $\lambda\lambda$ $2795,2802$ doublet, and fosters the production of a
broad boxy H$\alpha$ emission component. The rise in ionization in the outer
ejecta may quench some lines (e.g., the CaII near-infrared triplet). The
interaction power emerges preferentially in the UV, in particular at later
times, shifting the optical color to the blue, but increasing modestly the
optical luminosity. Strong thermalization and clumping seem to be required to
make an interaction superluminous in the optical. The UV range contains
essential signatures that provide critical constraints to infer the mass loss
history and inner workings of core-collapse SN progenitors at death.

mechanism, which, however, does not fully exploit the structure of Multi-head

TokenShift is based on a frame-wise ViT with features temporally shifted with
successive frames (at time t+1 and t-1). In contrast, the proposed MSCA
replaces MSA in the frame-wise ViT, and some MSA heads attend to successive
frames instead of the current frame. The computation cost is the same as the

attention is taken. There is a choice about which of key, query, and value are
taken from the successive frames, then we experimentally compared these

It is the generator of all the filters and the basic operation for

science, a large amount of data are expressed as signals defined on graphs. In
order to establish the theory of filtering, windowed Fourier transform and

  It is a fundamental problem since the vertex set of a graph is usually not a
vector space and the addition operation cannot be defined on the vertex set of
the graph. In this paper, based on our understanding on the core role of shift
operation in classical signal processing we propose the concept of atomic

norm-preserving, periodic, or real-preserving. The property of real-preserving
holds naturally in the classical signal processing, but no the research has
been reported on this topic in the graph signal setting. With these conditions
we propose the concept of normal atomic filters for graph signals, which
degenerates into the classical shift operator under mild conditions if the
graph is circulant. Typical examples of graphs that have or have not normal
atomic filters are given. Finally, as an application, atomic filters are
utilized to construct time-frequency atoms which constitute a frame of the

KB, on two popular fake news datasets - LIAR, a politics-based dataset, and
COVID-19, a dataset of messages posted on social media relating to the COVID-19

improve fake news detection on LIAR where the KB is relevant and up-to-date.
The mixed results on COVID-19 highlight the reliance on stylistic features and
the importance of domain-specific and current KBs.

carrier mobilities and electronic trap densities of semiconductors by analysing
the current density-voltage (JV) relationship for unipolar devices predicted by
the Mott-Gurney (MG) law. However, the interpretation of SCLC measurements for
metal-halide perovskites is problematic due to mobile ionic defects which
redistribute to screen electrostatic fields in devices during measurements. To
overcome this, an SCLC measurement protocol was recently suggested that
minimises ionic charge redistribution by probing the current during millisecond
voltage pulses superimposed on a background bias. Here, we use drift-diffusion
simulations with mobile ions to assess the validity of the MG law for analysing
both the standard and new protocol JV measurements. We simulated idealised
perovskite devices with differing mobile ion densities and compared them with
simulations and measurements of devices with typical contact materials. We
found the validity region for the MG law is limited to perovskites with mobile
ion densities lower than the device's equilibrium charge carrier density
(<10^17 cm-3 for 400 nm thick methylammonium lead iodide films) and contacts
with injection/extraction barriers <=0.1 eV. The latter limitation can be
partially overcome by increasing the device thickness, whereas the former
limitation cannot. This restricts the range of perovskite layer compositions
and viable contact materials that can be reliably analysed with the MG law.
Approaches such as estimating trap densities from the apparent voltage onset to
trap-free SCLC regime should also be critically reviewed since they rely on the
same potentially invalid assumptions as the MG law. Our results demonstrate
that extracting meaningful and accurate values for metal halide perovskite
material properties from SCLC maybe challenging, or often not possible.

a new strategy, based on Radial Basis Functions (RBF) mesh morphing technique

target distribution derived from Monte Carlo sums over samples from separate
analyses of parts of the hierarchy or from mock observations used to estimate
sensitivity to a target population. We investigate requirements on the number
of Monte Carlo samples needed to guarantee the estimator of the target
distribution is precise enough that it does not affect the inference. We
consider probabilistic models of how Monte Carlo samples are generated, showing
that the finite number of samples introduces additional uncertainty as they act
as an imperfect encoding of the components of the hierarchical likelihood.
Additionally, we investigate the behavior of estimators marginalized over
approximate measures of the uncertainty, comparing their performance to the
Monte Carlo point estimate. We find that correlations between the estimators at
nearby points in parameter space are crucial to the precision of the estimate.
Approximate marginalization that neglects these correlations will either
introduce a bias within the inference or be more expensive (require more Monte
Carlo samples) than an inference constructed with point estimates. We therefore
recommend that hierarchical inferences with empirically estimated target
distributions use point estimates.

high-speed communication systems. Coding gains of up to 1.2 dB compared to the

superiority in resolving closely spaced sources, but their computational cost
is usually heavy. This is especially the case for point sources with a
multi-cluster structure which requires processing large-sized data matrix
resulted from highly sampled measurements. To address this issue, we propose a
fast algorithm termed D-MUSIC, based on a measurement decoupling strategy. We
demonstrate theoretically that for point sources with a known cluster
structure, their measurement can be decoupled into local measurements of each
of the clusters by solving a system of linear equations that are obtained by
using a multipole basis. We further develop a subsampled MUSIC algorithm to
detect the cluster structure and utilize it to decouple the global measurement.
In the end, the MUSIC algorithm was applied to each local measurement to
resolve point sources therein. Compared to the standard MUSIC algorithm, the
proposed algorithm has comparable super-resolving capability while having a

engineers should determine the safety risks associated with failures (i.e.,
erroneous outputs) observed during testing. For DNNs processing images,
engineers visually inspect all failure-inducing images to determine common
characteristics among them. Such characteristics correspond to
hazard-triggering events (e.g., low illumination) that are essential inputs for
safety analysis. Though informative, such activity is expensive and
error-prone.
  To support such safety analysis practices, we propose SEDE, a technique that
generates readable descriptions for commonalities in failure-inducing,
real-world images and improves the DNN through effective retraining. SEDE
leverages the availability of simulators, which are commonly used for
cyber-physical systems. It relies on genetic algorithms to drive simulators
towards the generation of images that are similar to failure-inducing,
real-world images in the test set; it then employs rule learning algorithms to
derive expressions that capture commonalities in terms of simulator parameter
values. The derived expressions are then used to generate additional images to
retrain and improve the DNN.
  With DNNs performing in-car sensing tasks, SEDE successfully characterized
hazard-triggering events leading to a DNN accuracy drop. Also, SEDE enabled
retraining leading to significant improvements in DNN accuracy, up to 18
percentage points.

Among these, the recently emerged exciton hybridization opens access to
unexplored excitonic species, with a promise of enhanced interactions. Here, we
employ hybridized interlayer excitons (hIX) in bilayer MoS2 to achieve highly
nonlinear excitonic and polaritonic effects. Such interlayer excitons possess
an out-of-plane electric dipole as well as an unusually large oscillator
strength allowing observation of dipolar polaritons(dipolaritons) in bilayers
in optical microcavities. Compared to excitons and polaritons in MoS2
monolayers, both hIX and dipolaritons exhibit about 8 times higher
nonlinearity, which is further strongly enhanced when hIX and intralayer
excitons, sharing the same valence band, are excited simultaneously. This gives
rise to a highly nonlinear regime which we describe theoretically by
introducing a concept of hole crowding. The presented insight into many-body

achieve privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it consumes excessive
learning time due to the existence of straggler devices. In this paper, a novel
topology-optimized federated edge learning (TOFEL) scheme is proposed to tackle
the heterogeneity issue in federated learning and to improve the
communication-and-computation efficiency. Specifically, a problem of jointly
optimizing the aggregation topology and computing speed is formulated to
minimize the weighted summation of energy consumption and latency. To solve the
mixed-integer nonlinear problem, we propose a novel solution method of
penalty-based successive convex approximation, which converges to a stationary
point of the primal problem under mild conditions. To facilitate real-time
decision making, an imitation-learning based method is developed, where deep
neural networks (DNNs) are trained offline to mimic the penalty-based method,
and the trained imitation DNNs are deployed at the edge devices for online
inference. Thereby, an efficient imitate-learning based approach is seamlessly
integrated into the TOFEL framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed TOFEL scheme accelerates the federated learning process, and achieves
a higher energy efficiency. Moreover, we apply the scheme to 3D object
detection with multi-vehicle point cloud datasets in the CARLA simulator. The
results confirm the superior learning performance of the TOFEL scheme over
conventional designs with the same resource and deadline constraints.

distribution networks, whereas such forecasting is made possible by an
increasing number of smart meter installations. Because distribution networks
include a large amount of different loads at various aggregation levels, such
as individual consumers, transformer stations and feeders loads, it is
impractical to develop individual (or so-called local) forecasting models for
each load separately. Furthermore, such local models ignore the strong
dependencies between different loads that might be present due to their spatial
proximity and the characteristics of the distribution network. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a global modeling approach based on deep learning
for efficient forecasting of a large number of loads in distribution networks.
In this way, the computational burden of training a large amount of local
forecasting models can be largely reduced, and the cross-series information
shared among different loads can be utilized. Additionally, an unsupervised
localization mechanism and optimal ensemble construction strategy are also
proposed to localize/personalize the forecasting model to different groups of
loads and to improve the forecasting accuracy further. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on real-world smart meter data to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed approach compared to competing methods.

circuits to interactions with uncontrolled degrees of freedom degrading their
coherence. By using a simple stabilization sequence we show that a
superconducting fluxonium qubit is coupled to a two-level system (TLS)
environment of unknown origin, with a relatively long energy relaxation time
exceeding $50\,\text{ms}$. Implementing a quantum Szilard engine with an active
feedback control loop allows us to decide whether the qubit heats or cools its
TLS environment. The TLSs can be cooled down resulting in a four times lower
qubit population, or they can be heated to manifest themselves as a negative
temperature environment corresponding to a qubit population of $\sim 80\,\%$.
We show that the TLSs and the qubit are each other's dominant loss mechanism
and that the qubit relaxation is independent of the TLS populations.
Understanding and mitigating TLS environments is therefore not only crucial to
improve qubit lifetimes but also to avoid non-Markovian qubit dynamics.

high-energy neutrino flux in 2013, the source of those neutrinos remains
largely unknown. Since 2016, IceCube has published likely-astrophysical
neutrinos as public realtime alerts. Through a combination of normal survey and
triggered target-of-opportunity observations, ASAS-SN obtained images within 1
hour of the neutrino detection for 20% (11) of all observable IceCube alerts
and within one day for another 57% (32). For all observable alerts, we obtained
images within at least two weeks from the neutrino alert. ASAS-SN provides the
only optical follow-up for about 17% of IceCube's neutrino alerts. We recover
the two previously claimed counterparts to neutrino alerts, the flaring-blazar
TXS 0506+056 and the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg. We investigate the light

identify any further candidate neutrino sources. We also analysed the optical
light curves of Fermi 4FGL sources coincident with high-energy neutrino alerts,

constraints on the luminosity functions of neutrino sources for a range of
assumed evolution models.

convergence rate of the MD method with strongly convex objective functions in
both continuous-time and discrete-time. We formulate the problem of finding
convergence rates of the MD algorithms into feasibility problems of linear
matrix inequalities (LMIs) in both schemes. In particular, in continuous-time,
we show that the Bregman divergence function, which is commonly used as a
Lyapunov function for this algorithm, is a special case of the class of
Lyapunov functions associated with the Popov criterion, when the latter is
applied to an appropriate reformulation of the problem. Thus, applying the
Popov criterion and its combination with other IQCs, can lead to convergence
rate bounds with reduced conservatism. We also illustrate via examples that the
convergence rate bounds derived can be tight.

under the assumption that the axions free-stream after being emitted. We
perform both spherically symmetric (1D) and axisymmetric (2D) simulations. In
1D, we utilize a parameterized heating scheme to achieve explosions, whereas in
2D we self-consistently realize explosions through the neutrino heating
mechanism. Our 2D results for a $20 M_\odot$ progenitor show an impact of the
axion emission on the shock behavior and the explosion time when considering
values of the Peccei-Quinn energy scale $f_a \leq 2 \times 10^8$ GeV. The
strong cooling due to the axion emission accelerates the contraction of the
core and leads to more efficient neutrino heating and earlier explosions. For
the axion emission formalism utilized, the values of $f_a$ that impact the
explosion are close to, but in tension with current limits based on the
neutrinos detected from SN1987A. However, given the non-linear behavior of the
emission and the multidimensional nature of CCSNe, we suggest that a
self-consistent, multidimensional approach to simulating CCSNe, including any
late time accretion and cooling, is needed to fully explore the axion bounds
from supernovae and the impact on the CCSN explosion mechanism.

$^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe in the Galaxy. We studied the bulge and the disc of the
Galaxy in a galactocentric radius range 0-22 kpc. We assumed that the bulge
region (within 2 kpc) evolved quickly suffering a strong star formation burst,
while the disc formed more slowly and inside-out. We compared our results with
the $^{26}$Al mass observed by the $\gamma$-ray surveys COMPTEL and INTEGRAL to
select the best model. Concerning $^{60}$Fe, we do not have any observed mass
value so we just performed a theoretical prediction for future observations. In
conclusion, low, intermediate mass stars and Type Ia supernovae contribute
negligibly to the two isotopes, while massive stars are the dominant source.
The nova contribution is, however, necessary to reproduce the observations of
$^{26}$Al. Our best model predicts $2.12$ M$_{\odot}$ of $^{26}$Al, in
agreement with observations, while for $^{60}$Fe our best mass estimate is

effects of faults and attacks in one sub-system can propagate to other

of safety-critical control for CPS with coupled dynamics when some sub-systems
are subject to failure or attack. We first propose resilient-safety indices

impacts of faulty or compromised sub-systems on a set of specified safety
constraints. By incorporating the RSIs, we provide a sufficient condition for
the synthesis of control policies in each failure- and attack- free

faulty or compromised sub-systems to guarantee safety. We formulate
sum-of-square optimization programs to compute the RSIs and the safety-ensuring
control policies. We present a case study that applies our proposed approach on
the temperature regulation of three coupled rooms. The case study demonstrates
that control policies obtained using our algorithm guarantee system's safety

network analysis. Existing clique model mainly focuses on unsigned networks.
However, in real world, many applications are modeled as signed networks with
positive and negative edges. As the signed networks hold their own properties
different from the unsigned networks, the existing clique model is inapplicable
for the signed networks. Motivated by this, we propose the balanced clique
model that considers the most fundamental and dominant theory, structural
balance theory, for signed networks. Following the balanced clique model, we
study the maximal balanced clique enumeration problem (MBCE) which computes all
the maximal balanced cliques in a given signed network and the maximum balanced
clique search problem (MBCS) which computes the balanced clique with maximum
size. We show that MBCE problem and MBCS problem are both NP-Hard. For the MBCE
problem, a straightforward solution is to treat the signed network as two
unsigned networks and leverage the off-the-shelf techniques for unsigned
networks. However, such a solution is inefficient for large signed networks. To
address this problem, in this paper, we first propose a new maximal balanced
clique enumeration algorithm by exploiting the unique properties of signed
networks. Based on the new proposed algorithm, we devise two optimization
strategies to further improve the efficiency of the enumeration. For the MBCS
problem, we propose a new search framework based on search space partition. To
further improve the efficiency of the new framework, we propose multiple
optimization strategies regarding to redundant search branches and invalid
candidates. We conduct extensive experiments on large real datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness and scalability

  in solvent induced asphaltene precipitation","Preprint submitted to Fuel",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asphaltene precipitation is a crucial phase separation phenomenon in the oil
industry, especially in paraffinic froth treatment to extract bitumen from oil
sands ores. This work reveals the formation of particles at 0.2 to 0.4 um in
radius, defined as a primary sub-micron particle (PSMP), which is ubiquitous
from diffusive mixing between asphaltene solution and any of 23 types of
precipitants examined in our experiments. The yield and quantity of asphaltene
particles are affected not only by the Hildebrand solubility parameter of the
precipitants but also by the diffusion coefficients of the asphaltene solution
and the precipitant. The Population Balance Model (PBM) with the Hildebrand
solubility parameter has been used to model particle size distribution. Good
agreement has been achieved between numerical predictions and the experimental
data. It indicates that the colloid theory can describe the size distribution
of PSMP and larger aggregates. Therefore, this study provides new insight into
the mechanism for the dependence of yield and size distribution of the
precipitated asphaltene particles on the composition of precipitants and adding
inhibitors. Controlling of asphaltene yield and size distribution may be
applied to the process of hydrocarbon separation or asphaltene precipitation
prevention.

  structural, electronic and optical properties",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The ultra-high efficiency and cost-effective photovoltaics based on halide
preovskites have brought a revolution to ongoing photovoltaic research,
surpassing the expectations of the scientific community. However, structural
stability is a severe issue that hinders their wide-scale integration at the
device level. Compositional engineering with the halide mixing has become an
efficient way to deal with this issue without compromising device efficiency.
Herein, the structural, electronic and optical properties of the bromide mixed
orthorhombic $\rm{{RbPb(I_{1-x}Br_x)_3}}$ (where, $\rm{x}=0.25$, $0.50$ and
$0.75$) are calculated using the density functional theory. The electronic
bandstructure and density of states (DOS) are calculated using both PBE
(Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) and TB-mBJ (Tran Blaha modified Becke Johnson)
potential. The lowest energy bandgaps of $2.288$ and $2.986$ eV for bromide
mixing of $\rm{x}=0.50$ are obtained using PBE and TB-mBJ, respectively. In
contrast, the mixed bromide phases possess a smaller effective mass,
facilitating a better carrier transport through the mixed halide. Using PBE,
the excitons appear to be the Mott-Wannier type. However, the TB-mBJ predicts
the exciton to be Frenkel type for bromide mixing of $\rm{x}=0.75$ and a
Mott-Wannier type for all other mixing under study. The spectroscopic limited
maximum efficiency (SLME) is observed to be at the highest values of $14.0$\%
and $4.1$\% for the equal admixture of I and Br using PBE and TB-mBJ,
respectively. The calculated properties are consistent with the reported data
of the similar structures.

disturbances in the corona. It is generally believed that the vital key for the
formation of EUV waves is the rapid expansion of the loops that overlie
erupting cores in solar eruptions, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and
solar jets. However, the details of the interaction between the erupting cores
and overlying loops are not clear, because that the overlying loops are always
instantly opened after the energetic eruptions. Here, we present three typical
jet-driven EUV waves without CME to study the interaction between the jets and
the overlying loops that remained closed during the events. All three jets
emanated from magnetic flux cancelation sites in source regions. Interestingly,
after the interactions between jets and overlying loops, three EUV waves
respectively formed ahead of the top, the near end (close to the jet source),
and the far (another) end of the overlying loops. According to the magnetic
field distribution of the loops extrapolated from Potential Field Source
Surface method, it is confirmed that the birth places of three jet-driven EUV
waves were around the weakest magnetic field strength part of the overlying
loops. We suggest that the jet-driven EUV waves preferentially occur at the
weakest part of the overlying loops, and the location can be subject to the
magnetic field intensity around the ends of the loops.

  Figaro's main novelty is that it pushes the QR decomposition past the join.
This leads to several desirable properties. For acyclic joins, it takes time
linear in the database size and independent of the join size. Its execution is
equivalent to the application of a sequence of Givens rotations proportional to
the join size. Its number of rounding errors relative to the classical QR

IoTs and mobile device-based systems, which, however, may expose end users'

privacy-preserving data collection and analysis. However, existing few LDP
studies over streams are either applicable to finite streams only or suffering
from insufficient protection. This paper investigates this problem by proposing
LDP-IDS, a novel $w$-event LDP paradigm to provide practical privacy guarantee
for infinite streams at users end, and adapting the popular budget division
framework in centralized differential privacy (CDP). By constructing a unified
error analysi for LDP, we first develop two adatpive budget division-based LDP
methods for LDP-IDS that can enhance data utility via leveraging the
non-deterministic sparsity in streams. Beyond that, we further propose a novel
population division framework that can not only avoid the high sensitivity of
LDP noise to budget division but also require significantly less communication.
Based on the framework, we also present two adaptive population division
methods for LDP-IDS with theoretical analysis. We conduct extensive experiments
on synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and
efficiency pf our proposed frameworks and methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that, despite the effectiveness of the adaptive budget division

achieve much higher effectiveness and efficiency.

function while complying with constraints, both of which are affected by
uncertainties. The high computational cost of realistic simulations strongly
limits the number of evaluations and makes this type of problems particularly
challenging. In such a context, it is common to rely on Bayesian optimization
algorithms. Assuming, without loss of generality, that the uncertainty comes
from some of the inputs, it becomes possible to build a Gaussian process model
in the joint space of design and uncertain variables. A two-step acquisition
function is then used to provide, both, promising optimization variables
associated to relevant uncertain samples. Our overall contribution is to
correlate the constraints in the GP model and exploit this to optimally decide,
at each iteration, which constraint should be evaluated and at which point. The
coupled Gaussian model of the constraints relies on an output-as-input
encoding. The constraint selection idea is developed by enabling that each
constraint can be evaluated for a different uncertain input, thus improving the
refinement efficiency. Constraints coupling and selection are gradually
implement in 3 algorithm variants which are compared to a reference Bayesian
approach. The results are promising in terms of convergence speed, accuracy and
stability as observed on a 2, a 4 and a 27-dimensional problems.

Emission line Snapshot survey (MURALES). We observed 37 radio sources from the
3C sample with z<0.3 and declination <20 degrees with the MUSE optical integral
field spectrograph at the VLT. We here focus on the properties of the extended
emission line regions (EELRs) that can be studied with unprecedented detail
thanks to the depth of these observations. Line emission in the 10 FRIs is, in
most cases, confined to within <4 kpc, while large-scale (>4 kpc) ionized gas
is seen in all but two of the 26 FRIIs. It usually takes the form of elongated
or filamentary structures, typically extending between 10 and 30 kpc, but also
reaching distances of ~80 kpc. We find that 1) the large-scale ionized gas
structures show a tendency to be oriented at large angles from the radio axis,
and 2) the gas on a scale of a few kpc from the nucleus often shows ordered
rotation with a kinematical axis forming a median angle of 65 degrees with the
radio axis. We also discuss the velocity field and ionization properties of the
EELRs. The observed emission line structures appear to be associated with
gaseous ""superdisks"" formed after a gas rich merger. The different properties
of the EELR can be explained with a combination of the source evolutionary
state and the orientation of the ""superdisk"" with respect to the radio axis.
The general alignment between the superdisks and radio axis might be produced
by stable and coherent accretion maintained over long timescales.

important predictions: the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth is
generally decreasing but can be increasing for intermediate wealth levels, and
it jumps inversely proportional to the risk aversion at the reference point;
the implied relative risk aversion is roughly a smile in wealth; the welfare of
the poor is more vulnerable to wealth shocks than the wealthy. Moreover,
locally changing the risk aversion influences the optimal strategies globally,

Recently, Hevia Fajardo and Sudholt have shown that this setup with $c=1$ is

the hardest part is not close to the optimum, but rather at linear distance. We
show that this behavior is not specific to \onemax. If $s$ is small, then the
algorithm is efficient on all monotone functions, and if $s$ is large, then it
needs superpolynomial time on all monotone functions. In the former case, for
$c<1$ we show a $O(n)$ upper bound for the number of generations and $O(n\log

generations and $O(n^2\log\log n)$ evaluations. We also show formally that
optimization is always fast, regardless of $s$, if the algorithm starts in
proximity of the optimum. All results also hold in a dynamic environment where

An implicitly defined estimator (IDE) declares the minimizer/maximizer of a
selected cost/reward function as the parameter estimate. The maximum likelihood
(ML) and the least squares estimators are among the well known examples of this
class. In this paper, an exact MSE expression for implicitly defined estimators
with a symmetric and unimodal objective function is given. It is shown that the
expression reduces to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and misspecified CRLB
in the large sample size regime for ML and misspecified ML estimation,
respectively. The expression is shown to yield the Ziv-Zakai bound (without the
valley filling function) for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator when it
is used in a Bayesian setting, that is, when an a-priori distribution is
assigned to the unknown parameter. In addition, extension of the suggested
expression to the case of nuisance parameters is studied and some
approximations are given to ease the computations for this case. Numerical
results indicate that the suggested MSE expression not only predicts the
estimator performance in the asymptotic region; but it is also applicable for
the threshold region analysis, even for IDEs whose objective functions do not
satisfy the symmetry and unimodality assumptions. Advantages of the suggested
MSE expression are its conceptual simplicity and its relatively straightforward
numerical calculation due to the reduction of the estimation problem to a
binary hypothesis testing problem, similar to the usage of Ziv-Zakai bounds in
random parameter estimation problems.

basis for the well known model of the shearing box, can be used to study many
aspects of the dynamics of warped discs. In the local model, inclination of the
orbit of a test particle with respect to the reference orbit corresponds to a
vertical oscillation of the particle at the orbital frequency. Warping of a
disc corresponds to a locally axisymmetric corrugation of the midplane of the
disc that oscillates vertically at the orbital frequency, while evolution of
the warp corresponds to a modulation of the complex amplitude of the vertical
oscillation. We derive a conservation law for this amplitude that is the local
equivalent of the conservation of angular momentum and therefore governs the
evolution of the warp. For lengthscales that are long compared to the vertical
scaleheight of the disc, the known non-resonant and resonant regimes of warp
dynamics, including the diffusive and wavelike regimes of Keplerian discs,
occur in the local model in the same way as in a global view of warped discs.

learning to remove the biases on sensitive attributes from data
representations. It usually requires to incorporate the sensitive attribute
labels as prediction targets. However, in many scenarios the sensitive
attribute labels of many samples can be unknown, and it is difficult to train a
strong discriminator based on the scarce data with observed attribute labels,
which may lead to generate unfair representations. In this paper, we propose a
semi-supervised fair representation learning approach based on adversarial
variational autoencoder, which can reduce the dependency of adversarial fair
models on data with labeled sensitive attributes. More specifically, we use a
bias-aware model to capture inherent bias information on sensitive attribute by
accurately predicting sensitive attributes from input data, and we use a
bias-free model to learn debiased fair representations by using adversarial
learning to remove bias information from them. The hidden representations
learned by the two models are regularized to be orthogonal. In addition, the
soft labels predicted by the two models are further integrated into a
semi-supervised variational autoencoder to reconstruct the input data, and we
apply an additional entropy regularization to encourage the attribute labels
inferred from the bias-free model to be high-entropy. In this way, the

turbulent boundary layer (3DTBL) developing on the floor of a bent square duct
to investigate the predictive capability of three widely used wall models,
namely, a simple equilibrium stress model, an integral nonequilibrium model,
and a PDE nonequilibrium model. The numerical results are compared with the
experiment of Schwarz and Bradshaw (J. Fluid Mech. (1994), vol. 272, pp.
183-210). While the wall-stress magnitudes predicted by the three wall models
are comparable, the PDE nonequilibrium wall model produces a substantially more
accurate prediction of the wall-stress direction, followed by the integral
nonequilibrium wall model. The wall-stress direction from the wall models is
shown to have separable contributions from the equilibrium stress part and the
integrated nonequilibrium effects, where how the latter is modeled differs
among the wall models. The triangular plot of the wall-model solution reveals
different capabilities of the wall models in representing variation of flow
direction along the wall-normal direction. On the contrary, the outer LES
solution is unaffected by the type of wall model used, resulting in nearly
identical predictions of the mean and turbulent statistics in the outer region
for all the wall models. This is explained by the vorticity dynamics and the
inviscid skewing mechanism of generating the mean three-dimensionality.
Finally, the LES solution in the outer layer is used to study the anisotropy of
turbulence. In contrast to the canonical 2D wall turbulence, the Reynolds
stress anisotropy exhibit strong non-monotonic behavior with increasing wall
distance.

metastasis in T2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is critical for staging
of lymphoproliferative diseases. Prior work on LN detection has been limited to
specific anatomical regions of the body (pelvis, rectum) in single MR slices.
Therefore, the development of a universal approach to detect LN in full T2 MRI
volumes is highly desirable.
  Methods: In this study, a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) pipeline to
universally identify abdominal LN in volumetric T2 MRI using neural networks is
proposed. First, we trained various neural network models for detecting LN:
Faster RCNN with and without Hard Negative Example Mining (HNEM), FCOS,
FoveaBox, VFNet, and Detection Transformer (DETR). Next, we show that the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) VFNet model with Adaptive Training Sample Selection
(ATSS) outperforms Faster RCNN with HNEM. Finally, we ensembled models that
surpassed a 45% mAP threshold. We found that the VFNet model and one-stage
model ensemble can be interchangeably used in the CAD pipeline.
  Results: Experiments on 122 test T2 MRI volumes revealed that VFNet achieved
a 51.1% mAP and 78.7% recall at 4 false positives (FP) per volume, while the
one-stage model ensemble achieved a mAP of 52.3% and sensitivity of 78.7% at
4FP.
  Conclusion: Our contribution is a CAD pipeline that detects LN in T2 MRI
volumes, resulting in a sensitivity improvement of $\sim$14 points over the
current SOTA method for LN detection (sensitivity of 78.7% at 4 FP vs. 64.6% at
5 FP per volume).

variational Bayesian approach to infer their posteriors. Finally, we implement
the variational approach for single image super-resolution (SISR) using deep

Without the access to above information, most existing poisoning attacks
against recommender systems or federated learning lose validity. Benifiting
from this characteristic, FR is commonly considered fairly secured. However, we
argue that there is still possible and necessary security improvement could be
made in FR. To prove our opinion, in this paper we present FedRecAttack, a
model poisoning attack to FR aiming to raise the exposure ratio of target
items. In most recommendation scenarios, apart from private user-item
interactions (e.g., clicks, watches and purchases), some interactions are
public (e.g., likes, follows and comments). Motivated by this point, in
FedRecAttack we make use of the public interactions to approximate users'
feature vectors, thereby attacker can generate poisoned gradients accordingly
and control malicious users to upload the poisoned gradients in a well-designed
way. To evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of FedRecAttack, we conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets of different sizes from two
completely different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed FedRecAttack achieves the state-of-the-art effectiveness while its
side effects are negligible. Moreover, even with small proportion (3%) of
malicious users and small proportion (1%) of public interactions, FedRecAttack
remains highly effective, which reveals that FR is more vulnerable to attack

an alternate model to a black hole that comprises of three distinct regions,

barotropic equation of state parameter provide the mathematical formulation for
these regions. We construct the structure of a gravastar admitting conformal
motion for a specific model of energy-momentum squared gravity. The field
equations are formulated for a spherically symmetric spacetime with charged
perfect matter distribution. For the smooth matching of external and internal
spacetimes, we use Israel matching criteria. Various physical attributes of
gravastars such as the equation of state parameter, proper length, entropy and
energy are investigated (in the presence of charge) versus thickness of the
shell. The charge in the inner core of gravastars preserves the state of
equilibrium by counterbalancing the inward gravitational force. It is concluded
that the non-singular solutions of charged gravastar are physically viable in
the background of energy-momentum squared gravity.

characterization offers an analytic bound on the observed variability. We
validate the method using an ensemble of single qubit test circuits, executed

innovatively extract personalized speech features from human faces to
synthesize personalized speech using neural vocoder. A Face-based Residual
Personalized Speech Synthesis Model (FR-PSS) containing a speech encoder, a
speech synthesizer and a face encoder is designed for PSS. In this model, by
designing two speech priors, a residual-guided strategy is introduced to guide
the face feature to approach the true speech feature in the training. Moreover,
considering the error of feature's absolute values and their directional bias,
we formulate a novel tri-item loss function for face encoder. Experimental

  treatment","Preprint for ACS ES&T Water",,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The global need for clean water requires sustainable technology for purifying
contaminated water. Highly efficient solar-driven photodegradation is a
sustainable strategy for wastewater treatment. In this work, we demonstrate
that the photodegradation efficiency of micropollutants in water can be
improved by ~2-24 times by leveraging polymeric microlenses (MLs). These
microlenses (MLs) are fabricated from the in-situ polymerization of surface
nanodroplets. We found that photodegradation efficiency ({\eta}) in water
correlates approximately linearly with the sum of the intensity from all focal
points of MLs, although no difference in the photodegradation pathway is
detected from the chemical analysis of the byproducts. With the same overall
power over a given surface area, {\eta} is doubled by using ordered arrays,
compared to heterogeneous MLs on an unpatterned substrate. Higher {\eta} from
ML arrays may be attributed to a coupled effect from the focal points on the
same plane that creates high local concentrations of active species to further
speed up the rate of photodegradation. As a proof-of-concept for ML-enhanced
water treatment, MLs were formed on the inner wall of glass bottles that were
used as containers for water to be treated. Three representative
micropollutants (norfloxacin, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethoxazole) in the
bottles functionalized by MLs were photodegraded by 30% to 170% faster than in
normal bottles. Our findings suggest that the ML-enhanced photodegradation may
lead to a highly efficient solar water purification approach without a large
solar collector size. Such an approach may be particularly suitable for
portable transparent bottles in remote regions.

valuable in imaging to form a reliable diagnostic image. Given non convexity of
the objective function, it is challenging to avoid from different local minima.
Methods: We first formulate the global searching of multiply parameters to be a
k-D move in the parametric space, and convert parameters updating to be
state-action decision-making problem. We proposed a novel Deep Q-learning of
Model Parameters (DQMP) method for global optimization of model parameters by
updating the parameter configurations through actions that maximize a Q-value,
which employs a Deep Reward Network designed to learn global reward values from
both visible curve fitting errors and hidden parameter errors. Results: The
DQMP method was evaluated by viscoelastic imaging on soft matter by
Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD) modeling. In comparison to other
methods, imaging of parameters by DQMP yielded the smallest errors (< 2%) to
the ground truth images. DQMP was applied to viscoelastic imaging on biological
tissues, which indicated a great potential of imaging on physical parameters in
diagnostic applications. Conclusions: DQMP method is able to achieve global
optima, yielding accurate model parameter estimates in viscoelastic imaging.
Assessment of DQMP by simulation imaging and ultrasound breast imaging
demonstrated the consistency, reliability of the imaged parameters, and
powerful global searching ability of DQMP. Significance: DQMP method is
promising for imaging of multiple parameters, and can be generalized to global

the clustering of quasars. In conjunction with the Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP)
effect, which arises from the changing ratio of angular to spatial/redshift
size of (presumed) spherically-symmetric source distributions with distance,
the BAO measurement is viewed as one of the most powerful tools to use in
assessing the geometry of the Universe. In this paper, we employ five BAO peak

principal competitors, known as the R_h=ct universe. For completeness, we
complement the AP diagnostic with a volume-averaged distance probe that assumes
a constant comoving distance scale r_d. Both probes are free of uncertain
parameters, such as the Hubble constant, and are therefore ideally suited for
this kind of model selection. We find that R_h=ct is favored by these

that the conditions for the classical direct collapse scenario are very

here a more general case of a dense massive protostar cluster at low
metallicity (<~ 10^{-3} Z_solar) embedded in gas. We estimate the mass of the
central massive object, formed via collisions and gas accretion, considering
the extreme cases of a logarithmically flat and a Salpeter-type initial mass
function. Objects with masses of at least 10^4 solar could be formed for
inefficient radiative feedback, whereas ~10^3 solar mass objects could be
formed when the accretion time is limited via feedback. These masses will vary
depending on the environment and could be considerably larger, particularly due
to the continuous infall of gas into the cloud. As a result, one may form
intermediate mass black holes of ~ 10^4 solar masses or more. Upcoming
observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other observatories
may help to detect such massive black holes and their environment, thereby
shedding additional light on such a formation channel.

correlations in $3d^2$ systems. The theoretical framework represents a
restricted active space self-consistent field method, with active space
optimized to the number of all non-bonding orbitals. To demonstrate the
validity and effectiveness of the method, we explore the physical properties of
the trigonal bipyramidal spin-one single-ion magnet
(C$_6$F$_5$)$_3$trenVCN$^t$Bu. The obtained theoretical results show a good
agreement with the experimental data available in the literature. This includes
measurements for the magnetization, low-field susceptibility, cw-EPR and
photoluminescence spectroscopy. The proposed method may be reliably applied to
a variety of $3d^2$ magnetic systems. To this end, and for the sake
completeness, we provide detailed analytical and numerical representations for
the generic Hamiltonian's effective matrix elements related to the crystal
field, exchange, spin-orbit and Zeeman interactions.

[Eur. Phys. J. B 92, 93 (2019) and Phys. Rev. B 101, 094427 (2020)] to
characterize the unusual behavior of the magnetic spectrum, magnetization and
magnetic susceptibility of the molecular magnet Ni$_4$Mo$_{12}$. The
theoretical background is based on the molecular orbital theory in conjunction
with the multi-configurational self-consistent field method and results in a
post-Hartree-Fock scheme for constructing the corresponding energy spectrum.
Furthermore, we construct a bilinear spin-like Hamiltonian involving discrete
coupling parameters accounting for the relevant spectroscopic magnetic
excitations, magnetization and magnetic susceptibility. The explicit
expressions of the eigenenergies of the ensuing Hamiltonian are determined and
the physical origin of broadening and splitting of experimentally observed
peaks in the magnetic spectra is discussed. To demonstrate the efficiency of
our method we compute the spectral properties of a spin-one magnetic dimer. The
present approach may be applied to a variety of magnetic units based on
transition metals and rare earth elements.

Americans beginning in March 2020. Despite the beneficial, socially distanced
activity offered by outdoor recreation, confusing and contradictory public
health messaging complicated access to natural spaces. Working with a dataset
comprising the locations of roughly 50 million distinct mobile devices in 2019
and 2020, we analyze weekly visitation patterns for 8,135 parks across the
United States. Using Bayesian inference, we identify regions that experienced a
substantial change in visitation in the first few weeks of the pandemic. We
find that regions that did not exhibit a change were likely to have smaller
populations, and to have voted more republican than democrat in the 2020
elections. Our study contributes to a growing body of literature using passive
observations to explore who benefits from access to nature.
