perception neural network (NN) architecture providing object detection and
classification through bounding box estimations on camera images. As the NN is
trained on well annotated images, in this paper we study the variations of
confidence levels from the NN when tested on hand-crafted occlusion added to a
test set. We compare regular pedestrian detection to upper and lower body
detection. Our findings show that the two NN using only partial information
perform similarly well like the NN for the full body when the full body NN's
performance is 0.75 or better. Furthermore and as expected, the network, which
is only trained on the lower half body is least prone to disturbances from
occlusions of the upper half and vice versa.

automatically share information between similar assets, improving the survival
analysis of a truck fleet and power prediction in a wind farm. In each asset
management example, a set of correlated functions is learnt over the fleet, in
a combined inference, to learn a population model. Parameter estimation is
improved when sub-fleets share correlated information at different levels of
the hierarchy. In turn, groups with incomplete data automatically borrow
statistical strength from those that are data-rich. The statistical
correlations enable knowledge transfer via Bayesian transfer learning, and the

which effect (i.e. parameter). Both case studies demonstrate the wide
applicability to practical infrastructure monitoring, since the approach is
naturally adapted between interpretable fleet models of different in situ

for computer vision and natural language processing made these models
attractive to other research domains. In healthcare, there is a strong need for
tools that may improve the routines of the clinicians and the patients.
Naturally, the use of attention-based algorithms for medical applications
occurred smoothly. However, being healthcare a domain that depends on
high-stake decisions, the scientific community must ponder if these
high-performing algorithms fit the needs of medical applications. With this
motto, this paper extensively reviews the use of attention mechanisms in
machine learning (including Transformers) for several medical applications.
This work distinguishes itself from its predecessors by proposing a critical
analysis of the claims and potentialities of attention mechanisms presented in
the literature through an experimental case study on medical image
classification with three different use cases. These experiments focus on the
integrating process of attention mechanisms into established deep learning
architectures, the analysis of their predictive power, and a visual assessment
of their saliency maps generated by post-hoc explanation methods. This paper
concludes with a critical analysis of the claims and potentialities presented
in the literature about attention mechanisms and proposes future research lines
in medical applications that may benefit from these frameworks.

based on hidden inverses to mitigate coherent errors. In the context of error
mitigation, this means replacing the on hardware implementation of certain
Hermitian gates with their inverses. Doing so results in noise cancellation and
a more resilient quantum circuit. This approach improves performance in a
variety of two-qubit error models where the noise operator also inverts with
the gate inversion. We apply the mitigation scheme on superconducting quantum
processors running the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to find
the H$_{\rm 2}$ ground-state energy. When implemented on superconducting
hardware we find that the mitigation scheme effectively reduces the energy
fluctuations in the parameter learning path in VQE, reducing the number of
iterations for a converged value. We also provide a detailed numerical
simulation of VQE performance under different noise models and explore how
hidden inverses \& randomized compiling affect the underlying loss landscape of
the learning problem. These simulations help explain our experimental hardware
outcomes, helping to connect lower-level gate performance to
application-specific behavior in contrast to metrics like fidelity which often

Counter-intuitively, this implies that also the hotter of the two systems

overwhelms the (quantum) correlation build-up, classical energy dynamics
emerges where the energy in the hot system decreases immediately upon contact

denoted by $m_\mathrm{faithful}(\mathrm G)$, is the smallest integer $n$ such
that $\mathrm G$ can be embedded in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$. Continuing our
previous work (arXiv:1712.02019), we address the problem of determining the
faithful dimension of a finite $p$-group of the form $\mathcal
G_R:=\exp(\mathfrak g_R)$ associated to $\mathfrak g_R:=\mathfrak g
\otimes_\mathbb Z R $ in the Lazard correspondence, where $\mathfrak g$ is a
nilpotent $\mathbb Z$-Lie algebra and $R$ ranges over finite truncated
valuation rings.
  Our first main result is that if $R$ is a finite field with $p^f$ elements
and $p$ is sufficiently large, then $m_\mathrm{faithful}(\mathcal G_R)=fg(p^f)$
where $g(T)$ belongs to a finite list of polynomials $g_1,\ldots,g_k$, with
non-negative integer coefficients. The list of polynomials is uniquely
determined by the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$. Furthermore, for $1\leq i\leq k$
the set of pairs $(p,f)$ for which $g=g_i$ is a finite union of Cartesian
products $\mathcal P\times \mathcal F$, where $\mathcal P$ is a Frobenius set
of prime numbers and $\mathcal F$ is a subset of $\mathbb N$ that belongs to
the Boolean algebra generated by arithmetic progressions.
  Next we formulate a conjectural polynomiality property for
$m_\mathrm{faithful}(\mathcal G_R)$ in the more general setting where $R$ is a
finite truncated valuation ring, and prove special cases of this conjecture. In
particular, we show that for a vast class of Lie algebras $\mathfrak g $ that
are defined by partial orders, $m_\mathrm{faithful}(\mathcal G_R)$ is given by
a single polynomial-type formula.
  Finally, we compute $m_\mathrm{faithful}(\mathcal G_R)$ precisely in the case
where $\mathfrak g$ is the free metabelian nilpotent Lie algebra of class $c$
on $n$ generators and $R$ is a finite truncated valuation ring.

However, managing the rapidly increasing amounts of batteries at end-of-life
with lower economic and technical risk requires prediction of cycle life with
quantified uncertainty, which is still lacking. The interpretability (i.e., the
reason for high prediction accuracy) of these advanced data-driven methods is
also worthy of investigation. Here, a Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) model,
having the advantage of not assuming any specific distribution of cycle life,
is introduced to make cycle life range prediction with uncertainty quantified

from radiology and histopathology images routinely collected to predict

multimodal late fusion approach that combines hand-crafted features computed
from radiomics, pathomics and clinical data to predict radiation therapy
treatment outcomes for non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Within this
context, we investigate eight different late fusion rules (i.e. product,
maximum, minimum, mean, decision template, Dempster-Shafer, majority voting,

richness of information given by computer tomography images and whole-slide

cohort of 33 patients show that the proposed multimodal paradigm with an AUC
equal to $90.9\%$ outperforms each unimodal approach, suggesting that data
integration can advance precision medicine. As a further contribution, we also
compare the hand-crafted representations with features automatically computed

popular multimodal approach. In both cases, the experiments show that the

large nonreciprocal resistance compared to GeTe, the nonmagnetic counterpart
with the same crystal structure. The magnetic-field-angle dependence of the
nonreciprocal resistance is maximized when magnetic field is orthogonal to both
current and electric polarization, in accord with the symmetry argument. From
the analysis of temperature and magnetic field dependence, we deduce that
inelastic scatterings of electrons mediated by magnons dominantly contribute to
the observed nonreciprocal response. Furthermore, the nonreciprocal resistance
is significantly enhanced by lowering hole density. The Fermi level dependence
is attributed to the deformation of the Rashba band in which the spin-momentum
locked single Fermi surface appears by exchange field from the in-plane

superconductors, the onset of superconductivity is accompanied by a prominent
peak in the magnetic spectrum at momenta close to the wave-vector of the nearby
antiferromagnetic state. Such a peak is well described in terms of a spin
resonance mode, i.e., a spin-1 exciton theoretically predicted for quasi-2D
superconductors with a sign-changing gap. The same theories, however, indicate
that such a resonance mode should be absent in a three-dimensional (3D) system
with a spherical Fermi surface. This raises the question of the fate of the
spin resonance mode in layered unconventional superconductors that are not
strongly anisotropic, such as certain heavy-fermion compounds and potentially
the newly discovered nickelate superconductor NdNiO$_2$. Here, we use the
random-phase-approximation to calculate the dynamical spin susceptibility of 3D
superconductors with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap symmetry and corrugated
cylindrical-like Fermi surfaces. By varying the out-of-plane hopping anisotropy
$t_z/t$, we demonstrate that the appearance of a spin resonance mode is
determined by the topology of the hot lines -- i.e. lines on the Fermi surface
that are connected by the magnetic wave-vector. For an in-plane
antiferromagnetic wave-vector, the hot lines undergo a topological transition
from open lines to closed loops at a critical $t_z/t$ value. The closed hot
lines cross the nodal superconducting lines, making the spin resonance mode
overdamped and incoherent. In contrast, for an out-of-plane antiferromagnetic
wave-vector, the hot lines remain open and the spin resonance mode remains
sharp. We discuss the experimental implications of our results for the
out-of-plane dispersion of the spin resonance mode and, more generally, for
inelastic neutron scattering experiments on unconventional superconductors.

under $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields, i.e., hopping amplitudes with phases $\pm

bottle. This drastic change of the Brillouin zone theory is due to the
projective symmetry algebra enforced by the gauge field. Remarkably, the
non-orientability of the Brillouin Klein bottle corresponds to the topological
classification by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, in contrast to the Chern number
valued in $\mathbb{Z}$ for the usual Brillouin torus. The result is a novel
Klein-bottle insulator featuring topological modes at two edges related by a
nonlocal twist, radically distinct from all previous topological insulators.
Our prediction can be readily achieved in various artificial crystals, and the

from the available data assuming an underlying poroelastic biomechanics model.
For this purpose, a physics-informed manifold is built by sampling the space of
parameters describing the tissue model close to their physiological ranges to
simulate the corresponding poroelastic problem, and computing a reduced basis
via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Displacements and pressure reconstruction
is sought in a reduced space after solving a minimization problem that
encompasses both the structure of the reduced-order model and the available
measurements. The proposed pipeline is validated using synthetic data obtained
after simulating the poroelastic mechanics of a physiological brain. The
numerical experiments demonstrate that the framework can exhibit accurate joint
reconstructions of both displacement and pressure fields. The methodology can
be formulated for an arbitrary resolution of available displacement data from
pertinent images.

the full-batch Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm on smooth losses (possibly
non-Lipschitz, possibly nonconvex). At the heart of our analysis is an upper
bound on the generalization error, which implies that average output stability
and a bounded expected optimization error at termination lead to
generalization. This result shows that a small generalization error occurs
along the optimization path, and allows us to bypass Lipschitz or sub-Gaussian
assumptions on the loss prevalent in previous works. For nonconvex, convex, and
strongly convex losses, we show the explicit dependence of the generalization
error in terms of the accumulated path-dependent optimization error, terminal
optimization error, number of samples, and number of iterations. For nonconvex
smooth losses, we prove that full-batch GD efficiently generalizes close to any
stationary point at termination, and recovers the generalization error
guarantees of stochastic algorithms with fewer assumptions. For smooth convex
losses, we show that the generalization error is tighter than existing bounds
for SGD (up to one order of error magnitude). Consequently the excess risk
matches that of SGD for quadratically less iterations. Lastly, for strongly
convex smooth losses, we show that full-batch GD achieves essentially the same
excess risk rate as compared with the state of the art on SGD, but with an
exponentially smaller number of iterations (logarithmic in the dataset size).

constrains the contextualization of the WSI-level representation to a single

more demanding. In this paper, inspired by the pathological diagnostic process,

tissue-context information from multiple magnifications. The proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods in WSI classification on two large

Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) and processing time by up to 40x.

Bollob\'{a}s and Thomason, and independently Koml\'{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di,
states that average degree $O(k^2)$ guarantees the existence of a
$K_k$-subdivision. We study two directions extending this result. On the one
hand, Verstra\""ete conjectured that the quadratic bound $O(k^2)$ would
guarantee already two vertex-disjoint isomorphic copies of a $K_k$-subdivision.
On the other hand, Thomassen conjectured that for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there
is some $d = d(k)$ such that every graph with average degree at least $d$
contains a balanced subdivision of $K_k$, that is, a copy of $K_k$ where the
edges are replaced by paths of equal length. Recently, Liu and Montgomery
confirmed Thomassen's conjecture, but the optimal bound on $d(k)$ remains open.
In this paper, we show that the quadratic bound $O(k^2)$ suffices to force a
balanced $K_k$-subdivision. This gives the optimal bound on $d(k)$ needed in
Thomassen's conjecture and implies the existence of $O(1)$ many vertex-disjoint
isomorphic $K_k$-subdivisions, confirming Verstra\""ete's conjecture in a strong
sense.

challenges to the effectiveness and efficiency of episodic meta-learning
algorithms. Transfer learning approaches are a natural alternative, but they
are restricted to few-shot classification. Moreover, little attention has been
on the development of probabilistic models with well-calibrated uncertainty
from few-shot samples, except for some Bayesian episodic learning algorithms.
To tackle the aforementioned issues, we propose a new transfer learning method
to obtain accurate and reliable models for few-shot regression and
classification. The resulting method does not require episodic meta-learning
and is called meta-free representation learning (MFRL). MFRL first finds
low-rank representation generalizing well on meta-test tasks. Given the learned
representation, probabilistic linear models are fine-tuned with few-shot
samples to obtain models with well-calibrated uncertainty. The proposed method
not only achieves the highest accuracy on a wide range of few-shot learning
benchmark datasets but also correctly quantifies the prediction uncertainty. In
addition, weight averaging and temperature scaling are effective in improving
the accuracy and reliability of few-shot learning in existing meta-learning
algorithms with a wide range of learning paradigms and model architectures.

difficulty to solving the optimization model. Here we propose an adaptive
clustering method based on the decision variables of optimization model to
alleviate the computational complexity, in which the energy system is optimized

other emitter rather than leaking and dissipating into the reservoir photonic
modes. We also provide an example where a chain of two-level emitters
dominantly interact via the reciprocal modes of a plasmonic waveguide. We then
show that breaking reciprocity in such a system via driving a DC current

the end of volatile cycling and causing the heat death of formerly temperate

advantages of the scalable model capacity and high parallelism of transformers,
setting a new Pareto front between throughput and performance. Besides, ViTPose
is very flexible regarding the attention type, input resolution, pre-training

linked to the origin of the IceCube extragalactic high-energy neutrino flux.
Indeed, the production of high-energy neutrinos in extragalactic sources
implies the concomitant production of gamma rays at comparable energies. Within
the magnetic field of the neutrino emitting sources, gamma rays may efficiently
convert into ALPs, escape their host galaxy un-attenuated, propagate through
intergalactic space, and reconvert into gamma rays in the magnetic field of the
Milky Way. Such a scenario creates an all-sky diffuse high-energy gamma-ray
signal in the sub-PeV range. Accounting for the guaranteed Galactic
astrophysical gamma-ray contributions from cosmic-ray interactions with gas and
radiation and from sub-threshold sources, we set competitive upper limits on
the photon-ALP coupling constant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$. We find
$g_{a\gamma\gamma} < 2.1\times10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m_a \leq
2\times10^{-7}$ eV at a 95\% confidence level. Our results are comparable to
previous limits on ALPs derived from the TeV gamma-ray domain and progressively
close the mass gap towards ADMX limits. The code and data to reproduce the

differential privacy (DP) was proposed to address the problem of protecting the
privacy of each individual while keeping useful information about a population.
Sealfon (2016) introduced a private graph model in which the graph topology is
assumed to be public while the weight information is assumed to be private.
That model can express hidden congestion patterns in a known transportation
system. In this paper, we revisit the problem of privately releasing
approximate distances between all pairs of vertices in (Sealfon 2016). Our goal
is to minimize the additive error, namely the difference between the released
distance and actual distance under private setting. We propose improved
solutions to that problem for several cases.
  For the problem of privately releasing all-pairs distances, we show that for
tree with depth $h$, we can release all-pairs distances with additive error
$O(\log^{1.5} h \cdot \log^{1.5} V)$ for fixed privacy parameter where $V$ the
number of vertices in the tree, which improves the previous error bound
$O(\log^{2.5} V)$, since the size of $h$ can be as small as $O(\log V)$. Our
result implies that a $\log V$ factor is saved, and the additive error in tree
can be smaller than the error on array/path. Additionally, for the grid graph
with arbitrary edge weights, we also propose a method to release all-pairs
distances with additive error $\tilde O(V^{3/4}) $ for fixed privacy
parameters. On the application side, many cities like Manhattan are composed of
horizontal streets and vertical avenues, which can be modeled as a grid graph.

of frequencies spanning from radio to X-rays, emitted by a putative population
of $10^5 \, \rm{M_\odot}$ IMBHs wandering in five realistic, volume-weighted,

detected in the X-ray with Chandra, $\sim 37\%$ in the near-infrared with the
Roman Space Telescope, $\sim 49\%$ in the sub-mm with CMB-S4 and $\sim 57\%$ in
the radio with ngVLA. We find that the brightest fluxes are emitted by IMBHs
passing through molecular clouds or cold neutral medium, where they are always
detectable. We propose criteria to facilitate the selection of candidates in
multi-wavelength surveys. Specifically, we compute the X-ray to optical ratio
($\alpha_{\rm ox}$) and the optical to sub-mm ratio, as a function of the
accretion rate of the IMBH. We show that at low rates the sub-mm emission of
IMBHs is significantly higher than the optical, UV and X-ray emission. Finally,
we place upper limits on the number $N_\bullet$ of these objects in the MW:
$N_\bullet<2000$ and $N_\bullet<100$, based on our detectability expectations
and current lack of detections in molecular clouds and cold neutral medium,
respectively. These predictions will guide future searches of IMBHs in the MW,
which will be instrumental to understanding their demographics and evolution.

we present analyses of new deep HST/WFC3-IR and ACS images, aiming to
characterize the host galaxy and test this alternative scenario. We carefully
measure the light-weighted center of the host and reveal a significant spatial
offset from the quasar core ($11.1\pm0.1$kpc). The direction of the confirmed
offset aligns almost perpendicularly to the radio jet. We do not find evidence
of a recent merger, such as a young starburst in disturbed outskirts, but only
marginal light concentration in F160W at $\sim30$kpc. The host consists of
matured ($>200$Myr) stellar populations and one compact star-forming region. We
compare with hydro-dynamical simulations and find that those observed features
are consistently seen in late-stage merger remnants. Taken together, those

magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which span over 6 orders of magnitude in space
and time. The collapsing stellar envelope forms an accretion disk, which drags
inwardly the magnetic flux that accumulates around the BH, becomes dynamically
important and launches bipolar jets. The jets reach the photosphere at
$\sim10^{12}$ cm with an opening angle $\theta_j\sim6^\circ$ and a Lorentz
factor $\Gamma_j\lesssim 30$, unbinding $\gtrsim90\%$ of the star. We find that
(i) the disk-jet system spontaneously develops misalignment relative to the BH
rotational axis. As a result, the jet wobbles with an angle
$\theta_t\sim12^\circ$, which can naturally explain quiescent times in GRB
lightcurves. The effective opening angle for detection $\theta_j+\theta_t$
suggests that the intrinsic GRB rate is lower by an order of magnitude than
standard estimates. This suggests that successful GRBs may be rarer than
currently thought and emerge in only $\sim 0.1\%$ of supernovae Ib/c, implying
that jets are either not launched or choked inside most supernova Ib/c
progenitors. (ii) The magnetic energy in the jet decreases due to mixing with
the star, resulting in jets with a hybrid composition of magnetic and thermal
components at the photosphere, where $\sim 10\%$ of the gas maintains
magnetization $\sigma\gtrsim 0.1$. This indicates that both a photospheric
component and reconnection may play a role in the prompt emission.

model with constant cross-section of $\sigma_T/m_\chi = 1\ \mathrm{cm}^2

dark matter haloes and their baryonic content using the inertia tensor and
compare our measurements to the results of three $HST$ samples of gravitational
lenses and $Chandra$ and $XMM-Newton$ X-ray observations. We find that the
inclusion of baryons greatly reduces the differences between CDM and a SIDM,
together with the ability to draw constraints based on shapes. Lensing
measurements reject the predictions of CDM dark-matter-only simulations and
prefer one of the hydro scenarios. When we consider the total sample of lenses,
observational data prefer the CDM hydro scenario. The shapes of the X-ray
emitting gas are compatible with observational results in both hydro runs, with
CDM predicting higher elongations only in the very centre. Contrary to previous
claims at the scale of elliptical galaxies, we conclude that both CDM and our
SIDM model can still explain observed shapes once we include baryons in the
simulations. Our results demonstrate that this is essential to derive realistic
constraints and that new simulations are needed to confirm and extend our
findings.

disordered Majorana nanowires can be simulated by the random matrix theory, we
generalize the model of a single quantum dot to a chain of quantum dots by
analogy with the superconductor-semiconductor (SC-SM) nanowire Majorana
platform. We first define a new concept, the robustness of zero-bias
conductance peaks (ZBCPs), in terms of an effective random Hamiltonian
considering the self-energy of leads. We then study the joint distribution for
the robustness and ZBCPs, and find a strong correlation that the ZBCP with
stronger robustness is also prone to carry a larger conductance peak near
$2e^2/h$. This trend is more prominent in shorter chains than in longer chains.
This is consistent with experimentally observed ZBCPs associated with
disorder-induced trivial Andreev bound states (the so-called ugly ZBCPs).
Finally, we study the end-to-end correlation of the disorder-induced ZBCPs from
two leads by calculating the normalized mutual information, which estimates the
degrees of the correlation arising from the trivial ZBCPs. Our work provides an
estimate of several important metrics used in SC-SM experiments to determine
the nature of ZBCPs, including the robustness, quantization, and end-to-end
correlation of the trivial ZBCPs. Therefore, in order to claim any evidence for
MZMs, one must establish the observed ZBCPs to have considerable statistical
significance well beyond what we find in this work to exist for the trivial
peaks.

perturbed by random stellar flybys that excite their eccentricities. Once a
wide binary is driven to a sufficiently small pericenter approach,
gravitational wave (GW) emission becomes significant, and the binary inspirals
and merges. In our previous study, using simplified models for wide-BBHs, we
found that successive flybys lead to significant merger fractions of wide-BBHs
in less than Hubble time, making the flyby perturbation mechanism a relevant
contributor to the production rate of GW-sources. However, the exact rates and
detailed properties of the resulting GW sources depend on the wide binary
progenitors. In this paper we use detailed population synthesis models for the
initial wide-BBH population, considering several populations corresponding to
different natal-kick models and metallicities, and then follow the wide-BBHs
evolution due to flyby perturbations and GW-emission. We show that the
cumulative effect of flybys is conductive for the production of GW sources in
non-negligible rates of $1-20$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are sensitive to the
natal kicks model. Such rates are relevant to the observationally inferred
rate. Our models, now derived from detailed population of binaries, provide the
detailed properties of the produced GW-sources, including mass-functions and
delay times. The GW mergers are circularized when enter the aLIGO band; have a
preference for high velocity dispersion host galaxies (in particular
ellipticals); have a relatively uniform delay-time distribution; and likely
have mildly correlated (less than isolated evolution channels and more than
dynamical channels) prograde spin-spin and spin-orbits.

gravitational-wave signals from binary systems through changes in the
gravitational potential or dynamical friction effects. We assess the importance
of including relativistic effects in both the dark matter distribution and the
dynamical friction. As a first step we numerically calculate the particle dark
matter spike distribution in full general relativity, using both Hernquist and
Navarro-Frenk-White profiles in a Schwarzschild background, and we produce
analytical fits to the spike profiles for a large range of scale parameters.
Then we use a post-Newtonian prescription for the gravitational-wave dephasing
to estimate the effect of relativistic corrections to the spike profile and to
the dynamical friction. Finally we include the torques generated by dynamical
friction in fast-to-generate relativistic models for circular extreme

that can be generated in a single satellite pass over the ground station is
severely restricted by the pass duration and the free-space optical channel
loss. High channel loss may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio due to
background noise, reduce the number of generated raw key bits, and increase the
quantum bit error rate (QBER), all of which have detrimental effects on the
output secret key length. Under finite-size security analysis, higher QBER
increases the minimum raw key length necessary for non-zero secret key length
extraction due to less efficient reconciliation and post-processing overheads.
We show that recent developments in finite key analysis allow three different
small-satellite-based QKD projects CQT-Sat, UK-QUARC-ROKS, and QEYSSat to
produce secret keys even under very high loss conditions, improving on
estimates based on previous finite key bounds. This suggests that satellites in
low Earth orbit can satisfy finite-size security requirements, but remains
challenging for satellites further from Earth.

imprint of the deformability properties of the coalescing bodies, and then of
the equation of state of neutron stars. In current models of the waveforms
emitted in these events, the contribution of tidal deformation is encoded in a
set of parameters, the tidal Love numbers. More refined models include
tidal-rotation couplings, described by an additional set of parameters, the
rotational tidal Love numbers, which appear in the waveform at $6.5$
post-Newtonian order. For neutron stars with spins as large as $\sim0.1$, we
show that neglecting tidal-rotation couplings may lead to a significant error
in the parameter estimation by third-generation gravitational wave detectors.
By performing a Fisher matrix analysis we assess the measurability of
rotational tidal Love numbers, showing that their contribution in the waveform
could be measured by third-generation detectors. Our results suggest that
current models of tidal deformation in late inspiral should be improved in
order to avoid waveform systematics and extract reliable information from
gravitational wave signals observed by next generation detectors.

approximated via Taylor expansion, we propose a simple framework, named
PolyLoss, to view and design loss functions as a linear combination of

focal loss as special cases. Extensive experimental results show that the
optimal choice within the PolyLoss is indeed dependent on the task and dataset.
Simply by introducing one extra hyperparameter and adding one line of code, our
Poly-1 formulation outperforms the cross-entropy loss and focal loss on 2D

Newman et al. (2021) simulated such 10-year surveys under various telescope

potentially habitable Earth-mass planets in the absence of stellar variability.
Here, we investigate the effect of stellar variability on the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the planet mass measurements in these simulations. We find that
correlated noise due to active regions has the largest effect on the observed
mass SNR, reducing the SNR by a factor of $\sim$5.5 relative to the
no-variability scenario -- granulation reduces by a factor of $\sim$3, while
p-mode oscillations has little impact on the proposed survey strategies. We
show that in the presence of correlated noise, 5-cm s$^{-1}$ instrumental
precision offers little improvement over 10-cm s$^{-1}$ precision, highlighting
the need to mitigate astrophysical variability. With our noise models,
extending the survey to 15 years doubles the number of Earth-analogs with mass
SNR $>$ 10, and reaching this threshold for any Earth-analog orbiting a star

the black hole spin's ability to regularly re-orientate the jet so that the
jet-induced turbulence is driven in a quasi-isotropic fashion, the HBI remains
efficient outside the central 50 kpc of the cluster, where the reservoir of

homogeneous, magnitude-limited ($V\leq12$) spectroscopic survey of northern
Galactic WR stars, this paper aims to establish the observed and intrinsic
multiplicity properties of the early-type nitrogen-rich WR population (WNE). We
obtained high-resolution spectroscopic time series of the complete
magnitude-limited sample of 16 WNE stars observable with the 1.2 m Mercator
telescope at La Palma, typically providing a time base of about two to eight
years. We measured relative radial velocities (RVs) using cross-correlation and
used RV variations to flag binary candidates. Adopting a peak-to-peak RV
variability threshold of 50 km/s as a criterion found an observed multiplicity
fraction of 0.44$\pm$0.12. Using an updated Monte Carlo method with a Bayesian
framework, we calculated the three-dimensional likelihood for the intrinsic
binary fraction, the maximum period, and the power-law index for the period
distribution for the WNE population. We also re-derived multiplicity parameters
for the Galactic WC population. We found an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of
$0.56\substack{+0.20 \\ -0.15}$ for the parent WNE population. For the Galactic
WC population, we re-derive an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of
$0.96\substack{+0.04 \\ -0.22}$. The derived multiplicity parameters for the
WNE population are quite similar to those derived for main-sequence O binaries

the usual mean square and risk-sensitive criteria as particular cases. Due to
the presence of the ""cost-shaping"" analytic function, the performance criterion

governed in state space by linear stochastic differential equations, we develop
a method for recursively computing the Hardy-Schatten norms through a recently

Wick ordering of annihilation and creation operators in quantum mechanics. The
resulting computational procedure involves a recurrence sequence of solutions

is unsuitable to model the cores of these lines. For both lines, the scattering
processes that are perturbed by elastic collisions give a significant
contribution only to the intensity component of the emissivity. Neglecting
collisional as well as Doppler redistribution represents a rough but suitable

of them used Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to model user-item

(WGAN-GP) on recommendation has received relatively less scrutiny. In this
paper, we focus on two questions: 1- Can we successfully apply WGAN-GP on
recommendation and does this approach give an advantage compared to the best
GAN models? 2- Are GAN-based recommender systems relevant? To answer the first
question, we propose a recommender system based on WGAN-GP called CFWGAN-GP
which is founded on a previous model (CFGAN). We successfully applied our
method on real-world datasets on the top-k recommendation task and the
empirical results show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art GAN
approaches, but we found no evidence of significant advantage of using WGAN-GP
instead of the original GAN, at least from the accuracy point of view. As for
the second question, we conduct a simple experiment in which we show that a
well-tuned conceptually simpler method outperforms GAN-based models by a
considerable margin, questioning the use of such models.

However, it is still challenging to find latent variables, which have the
capacity for preserving the appearance of the input subject (e.g., identity,

paper, we present a method to expand the latent space of StyleGAN with
additional content features to break down the trade-off between low-distortion

rapid non-conservative mass transfer with about 5-26 % of transferred mass lost

this binary and its components in the past. In fact, this system closely

rolled out via a sampling-based approach and are used in a model predictive

computer-vision deep neural nets (DNNs), a new breed of video streaming systems
has emerged, with the goal to compress and stream videos to remote servers in
real time while preserving enough information to allow highly accurate
inference by the server-side DNNs. An ideal design of the video streaming
system should simultaneously meet three key requirements: (1) low latency of
encoding and streaming, (2) high accuracy of server-side DNNs, and (3) low
compute overheads on the camera. Unfortunately, despite many recent efforts,
such video streaming system has hitherto been elusive, especially when serving
advanced vision tasks such as object detection or semantic segmentation. This
paper presents AccMPEG, a new video encoding and streaming system that meets
all the three requirements. The key is to learn how much the encoding quality
at each (16x16) macroblock can influence the server-side DNN accuracy, which we
call accuracy gradient. Our insight is that these macroblock-level accuracy
gradient can be inferred with sufficient precision by feeding the video frames
through a cheap model. AccMPEG provides a suite of techniques that, given a new
server-side DNN, can quickly create a cheap model to infer the accuracy
gradient on any new frame in near realtime. Our extensive evaluation of AccMPEG
on two types of edge devices (one Intel Xeon Silver 4100 CPU or NVIDIA Jetson
Nano) and three vision tasks (six recent pre-trained DNNs) shows that AccMPEG
(with the same camera-side compute resources) can reduce the end-to-end

Produced segmentation maps are then processed further for detecting changes and
the results are refined using morphological methods. For the change detection

regularization to favor certain properties of the space over others, and the

these properties; here, we use the same data-driven approach to construct the
latent space and then map back to the ambient space.

that can allow for ultrafast qubit control. The exact manifestation of SOI in a

experimentally. Here, we develop a detailed theoretical connection between the
leakage current through a double quantum dot in Pauli spin blockade and the
underlying SOI in the system. We present a general analytic expression for the
leakage current, which allows to connect experimentally observable features to
both the magnitude and orientation of the effective spin--orbit field acting on
the moving carriers. Motivated by the large recent interest in hole-based
quantum devices, we further zoom in on the case of Pauli blockade of hole
spins, assuming a strong transverse confinement potential. In this limit we
also find an analytic expression for the current at low external magnetic
field, that includes the effect of hyperfine coupling of the hole spins to
randomly fluctuating nuclear spin baths. This result can be used to extract
detailed information about both hyperfine and spin--orbit coupling parameters
for hole spins in devices with a significant fraction of non-zero nuclear

understanding the Milky Way, because all observations of our Galaxy are made
from our heliocentric reference point. The uncertainty in $R_0$ limits our
knowledge of many aspects of the Milky Way, including its total mass and the
relative mass of its major components, and any orbital parameters of stars
employed in chemo-dynamical analyses. While measurements of $R_0$ have been
improving over a century, measurements in the past few years from a variety of
methods still find a wide range of $R_0$ being somewhere within $8.0$ to
$8.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$. The most precise measurements to date have to assume that
Sgr A$^*$ is at rest at the Galactic center, which may not be the case. In this
paper, we use maps of the kinematics of stars in the Galactic bar derived from
APOGEE DR17 and Gaia EDR3 data augmented with spectro-photometric distances
from the \texttt{astroNN} neural-network method. These maps clearly display the
minimum in the rotational velocity $v_T$ and the quadrupolar signature in
radial velocity $v_R$ expected for stars orbiting in a bar. From the minimum in
$v_T$, we measure $R_0 = 8.23 \pm 0.12\,\mathrm{kpc}$. We validate our
measurement using realistic $N$-body simulations of the Milky Way. We further
measure the pattern speed of the bar to be $\Omega_\mathrm{bar} =
40.08\pm1.78\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$. Because the bar forms out
of the disk, its center is manifestly the barycenter of the bar+disc system and
our measurement is therefore the most robust and accurate measurement of $R_0$
to date.

to close this gap in our current work. Specifically, we try to answer questions
such as: How long does a product retain a badge on a given platform? If a
product is sold on different platforms, then does it receive similar badges?
How do the products that receive badges differ from those which do not, in
terms of price, customer rating, etc. We collect longitudinal data from several
e-commerce platforms over 45 days, and find that although most of the badges
are short-lived, there are several permanent badge assignments and that too for
badges meant to denote urgency or scarcity. Furthermore, it is unclear how the
badge assignments are done, and we find evidence that highly-rated products are
missing out on badges compared to lower quality ones. Our work calls for

associated with a lower than expected rate of citations. In some fields, that
disparity is driven primarily by the citations of men and is increasing over
time despite increasing diversification of the profession. It is likely that
complex social interactions and individual ideologies shape these disparities.
Computational models of select factors that reproduce empirical observations
can help us understand some of the minimal driving forces behind these complex
phenomena and therefore aid in their mitigation. Here, we present a simple
agent-based model of citation practices within academia, in which academics
generate citations based on three factors: their estimate of the collaborative
network of the field, how they sample that estimate, and how open they are to
learning about their field from other academics. We show that increasing
homophily -- or the tendency of people to interact with others more like
themselves -- in these three domains is sufficient to reproduce observed biases
in citation practices. We find that homophily in sampling an estimate of the
field influences total citation rates, and openness to learning from new and
unfamiliar authors influences the change in those citations over time. We next
model a real-world intervention -- the citation diversity statement -- which
has the potential to influence both of these parameters. We determine a
parameterization of our model that matches the citation practices of academics
who use the citation diversity statement. This parameterization paired with an
openness to learning from many new authors can result in citation practices
that are equitable and stable over time. Ultimately, our work underscores the
importance of homophily in shaping citation practices and provides evidence
that specific actions may mitigate biased citation practices in academia.

and privacy which today's solutions cannot fully address. Fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) elevates the bar of today's solutions by adding
confidentiality of data during processing. It allows computation on fully
encrypted data without the need for decryption, thus fully preserving privacy.
To enable processing encrypted data at usable levels of classic security, e.g.,
128-bit, the encryption procedure introduces noticeable data size expansion -
the ciphertext is much bigger than the native aggregate of native data types.
In this paper, we present MemFHE which is the first accelerator of both client
and server for the latest Ring-GSW (Gentry, Sahai, and Waters) based
homomorphic encryption schemes using Processing In Memory (PIM). PIM alleviates
the data movement issues with large FHE encrypted data, while providing in-situ
execution and extensive parallelism needed for FHE's polynomial operations.
While the client-PIM can homomorphically encrypt and decrypt data, the
server-PIM can process homomorphically encrypted data without decryption.
MemFHE's server-PIM is pipelined and is designed to provide flexible
bootstrapping, allowing two encryption techniques and various FHE
security-levels based on the application requirements. We evaluate MemFHE for
various security-levels and compare it with state-of-the-art CPU

the intensity of key natural phenomena. One important feature of satellite
images is the trade-off between spatial/spectral resolution and their
revisiting time, a consequence of design and physical constraints imposed by
satellite orbit among other technical limitations. In this paper, we focus on
fusing multi-temporal, multi-spectral images where data acquired from different
instruments with different spatial resolutions is used. We leverage the spatial
relationship between images at multiple modalities to generate high-resolution
image sequences at higher revisiting rates. To achieve this goal, we formulate
the fusion method as a recursive state estimation problem and study its
performance in filtering and smoothing contexts. The proposed strategy clearly
outperforms competing methodologies, which is shown in the paper for real data
acquired by the Landsat and MODIS instruments.

stage, within the alternative theories of gravity of Brans Dicke, Rosen, and
Lightman Lee. This study is performed without making an explicit use of the
Transverse Traceless gauge of the General Relativity approach, and at the
Newtonian limit. Consequently such additional polarization modes appear
(non-tensorial) due to additional degrees of freedom in modified theories of
gravitation. We model and compare the different polarization modes and strain
signals for each scheme varying the sky location. Our analysis allows us to
identify the locations where these modes are more intense, and, therefore
susceptible to being identified for the future interferometer detector network.
This gives rise to a framework in which the amplitude and the intensity of all
polarization modes of general relativity and alternative hypotheses can be
compared.

minimizes this new observable. By comparing images with different structural
properties, we show that the optimal temperature is a good proxy for complexity
at different scales. Noting that the convoluted error is a key observable, we
directly minimize it using a Monte Carlo algorithm to generate a new series of
quantized images. Adopting an original approach based on the informativity of
finite size samples, we are able to determine the optimal convolution parameter
leading to the best visuals. Finally, we test the robustness of our method
against changes in image type, color palette and convolution kernel.

in the third release of data from the Gaia mission, Gaia DR3 (and for the early
third release, Gaia EDR3, which contains identical astrometric results). The
reference frame is defined by the positions and proper motions at epoch 2016.0
for a specific set of extragalactic sources in the (E)DR3 catalogue.
  We describe the construction of Gaia-CRF3, and its properties in terms of the
distributions in magnitude, colour, and astrometric quality.
  Compact extragalactic sources in Gaia DR3 were identified by positional
cross-matching with 17 external catalogues of quasars (QSO) and active galactic
nuclei (AGN), followed by astrometric filtering designed to remove stellar
contaminants. Selecting a clean sample was favoured over including a higher
number of extragalactic sources. For the final sample, the random and
systematic errors in the proper motions are analysed, as well as the
radio-optical offsets in position for sources in the third realisation of the
International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3).
  The Gaia-CRF3 comprises about 1.6 million QSO-like sources, of which 1.2
million have five-parameter astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3 and 0.4 million
have six-parameter solutions. The sources span the magnitude range G = 13 to 21
with a peak density at 20.6 mag, at which the typical positional uncertainty is
about 1 mas. The proper motions show systematic errors on the level of 12
${\mu}$as yr${}^{-1}$ on angular scales greater than 15 deg. For the 3142
optical counterparts of ICRF3 sources in the S/X frequency bands, the median
offset from the radio positions is about 0.5 mas, but exceeds 4 mas in either
coordinate for 127 sources. We outline the future of the Gaia-CRF in the next
Gaia data releases.

code written in high-level languages to be executed with near-native speed by
the browser's JavaScript engine. However, given that WebAssembly binaries can
be compiled from unsafe languages like C/C++, classical code vulnerabilities
such as buffer overflows or format strings can be transferred over from the
original programs down to the cross-compiled binaries. As a result, this
possibility of incorporating vulnerabilities in WebAssembly modules has widened
the attack surface of modern web applications. This paper presents Wasmati, a
static analysis tool for finding security vulnerabilities in WebAssembly
binaries. It is based on the generation of a code property graph (CPG), a
program representation previously adopted for detecting vulnerabilities in
various languages but hitherto unapplied to WebAssembly. We formalize the
definition of CPG for WebAssembly, introduce techniques to generate CPG for
complex WebAssembly, and present four different query specification languages
for finding vulnerabilities by traversing a program's CPG. We implemented ten
queries capturing different vulnerability types and extensively tested Wasmati
on four heterogeneous datasets. We show that Wasmati can scale the generation
of CPGs for large real-world applications and can efficiently find
vulnerabilities for all our query types. We have also tested our tool on
WebAssembly binaries collected in the wild and identified several potential
vulnerabilities, some of which we have manually confirmed to exist unless the
enclosing application properly sanitizes the interaction with such affected
binaries.

from both experimental and theoretical points of view -- is the nature of its
superconducting phase. In this work we perform a comprehensive synthesis of
existing experiments, and argue that experimental constraints are strong enough
to allow the structure of the superconducting order parameter to be nearly
uniquely determined. In particular, we argue that the order parameter is nodal,
and is formed from an admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs.
This argument is made on phenomenological grounds, without committing to any
particular microscopic model of the superconductor. Existing data is
insufficient to determine the orbital parity of the order parameter, which
could be either p-wave or d-wave. We propose a way in which the measurement of
Andreev edge states can be used to distinguish between the two.

approach to this problem. In this work, we present Robust Adversarial
Model-Based Offline RL (RAMBO), a novel approach to model-based offline RL. We
formulate the problem as a two-player zero sum game against an adversarial
environment model. The model is trained to minimise the value function while
still accurately predicting the transitions in the dataset, forcing the policy
to act conservatively in areas not covered by the dataset. To approximately
solve the two-player game, we alternate between optimising the policy and
adversarially optimising the model. The problem formulation that we address is
theoretically grounded, resulting in a probably approximately correct (PAC)
performance guarantee and a pessimistic value function which lower bounds the
value function in the true environment. We evaluate our approach on widely
studied offline RL benchmarks, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines.

evaluate the choice of threshold and rate as an optimization problem (regret

  We begin by exploring the effectiveness of using thresholding mechanisms to
modulate overall bandwidth consumption. Next, we separately consider the regret
of heterogeneous users who are {\em streamers}, wishing to view content over a
finite period of fixed rates, and users who are {\em file downloaders},
desiring a fixed amount of bandwidth per month at their highest obtainable

from a variety of plans that vary the cap on the unbounded-rate data, and
demonstrate the convergence of the game. Our model provides a fresh perspective
on a fair allocation of resources where the demand is higher than capacity,

equations with applications in weather modeling, healthcare, manufacturing,

real-world problems. To address this, a Self-scalable tanh (Stan) activation
function is proposed for the PINNs. The proposed Stan function is smooth,
non-saturating, and has a trainable parameter. During training, it can allow
easy flow of gradients to compute the required derivatives and also enable
systematic scaling of the input-output mapping. It is shown theoretically that
the PINNs with the proposed Stan function have no spurious stationary points
when using gradient descent algorithms. The proposed Stan is tested on a number
of numerical studies involving general regression problems. It is subsequently
used for solving multiple forward problems, which involve second-order
derivatives and multiple dimensions, and an inverse problem where the thermal
diffusivity of a rod is predicted with heat conduction data. These case studies
establish empirically that the Stan activation function can achieve better
training and more accurate predictions than the existing activation functions
in the literature.

susceptibility for humans. We also asked whether face-identification
performance in a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is affected by the
race of morphed faces. Caucasian (CA) and East-Asian (EA) participants
performed a face-identity matching task on pairs of CA and EA face images in
two conditions. In the morph condition, different-identity pairs consisted of
an image of identity ""A"" and a 50/50 morph between images of identity ""A"" and
""B"". In the baseline condition, morphs of different identities never appeared.
As expected, morphs were identified mistakenly more often than original face
images. Moreover, CA participants showed an advantage for CA faces in
comparison to EA faces (a partial ORE). Of primary interest, morph
identification was substantially worse for cross-race faces than for own-race
faces. Similar to humans, the DCNN performed more accurately for original face
images than for morphed image pairs. Notably, the deep network proved
substantially more accurate than humans in both cases. The results point to the
possibility that DCNNs might be useful for improving face identification
accuracy when morphed faces are presented. They also indicate the significance

declared. One of the main building blocks of the approach is a semantic
segmentation algorithm that attaches probabilities to each pixel of a single

and previous measurements to obtain the best estimates. Feasibility is
illustrated by presenting a number of examples generated by a realistic

part because motion from an animal's movement creates artifacts in fluorescence
intensity time-series that are difficult to distinguish from neural signals of
interest. One approach to mitigating these artifacts is to image two channels;
one that captures an activity-dependent fluorophore, such as GCaMP, and another
that captures an activity-independent fluorophore such as RFP. Because the
activity-independent channel contains the same motion artifacts as the
activity-dependent channel, but no neural signals, the two together can be used
to remove the artifacts. Existing approaches for this correction, such as
taking the ratio of the two channels, do not account for channel independent
noise in the measured fluorescence. Moreover, no systematic comparison has been
made of existing approaches that use two-channel signals. Here, we present
Two-channel Motion Artifact Correction (TMAC), a method which seeks to remove
artifacts by specifying a generative model of the fluorescence of the two
channels as a function of motion artifact, neural activity, and noise. We
further present a novel method for evaluating ground-truth performance of
motion correction algorithms by comparing the decodability of behavior from two
types of neural recordings; a recording that had both an activity-dependent
fluorophore (GCaMP and RFP) and a recording where both fluorophores were
activity-independent (GFP and RFP). A successful motion-correction method
should decode behavior from the first type of recording, but not the second. We
use this metric to systematically compare five methods for removing motion
artifacts from fluorescent time traces. We decode locomotion from a GCaMP
expressing animal 15x more accurately on average than from control when using
TMAC inferred activity and outperform all other methods of motion correction
tested.

study Swap Schelling Games with single-peaked utility functions. Our main
finding is that tolerance, i.e., agents favoring fifty-fifty neighborhoods or
being in the minority, is necessary for equilibrium existence on almost regular

of isolation criteria, our generator is built such that no technical cuts are
needed at any stage of the event generation. Therefore, our predictions can be
used to simulate kinematic distributions with arbitrary fiducial cuts.
Furthermore, we describe a few modifications of the MiNNLOPS formalism in order
to allow for a setting of the renormalization and factorization scales more
similar to that of a fixed-order computation, thus reducing the numerical
impact of higher-order terms beyond the nominal accuracy. Finally, we show
several phenomenological distributions of physical interest obtained by
showering the generated events with Pythia8, and we compare them with the 13
TeV data from the ATLAS Collaboration.

High-velocity shocks are produced during the early stages of the collision and

based on instantaneous optic flow, the velocity of retinal image motion.
However, we previously found that humans are unable to use instantaneous optic
flow to accurately estimate heading and require time-varying optic flow
(Burlingham and Heeger, 2020). We proposed the hypothesis that heading
perception is computed from optic acceleration, the temporal derivative of
optic flow, based on the observation that heading is aligned perfectly with a
point on the retina with zero optic acceleration. However, this result was
derived for a specific scenario used in our experiments, when retinal heading
and rotational velocity are constant over time. We previously speculated that
as the change over time in heading or rotation increases, the bias of the
estimator would increase proportionally, based on the idea that our derived
case would approximate what happens in a small interval of time (when heading
and rotation are nearly constant). In this technical report, we characterize
the properties of the optic acceleration field and derive the bias of this
estimator for the more common case of a fixating observer, i.e., one that moves
while counter-rotating their eyes to stabilize an object on the fovea. For a
fixating observer tracking a point on a fronto-parallel plane, there are in
fact two singularities of optic acceleration: one that is always at fixation
(due to image stabilization) and a second whose bias scales inversely with
heading, inconsistent with human behavior. For movement parallel to a ground
plane, there is only one singularity of optic acceleration (at the fixation
point), which is uninformative about heading. We conclude that the singularity
of optic acceleration is not an accurate estimator of heading under natural
conditions.

positive weight and one seeks an assignment of maximum weight. The literature
almost solely considers the case of positive weights. While the general case of

Instead of maximizing the sum of weights of satisfied clauses, we can maximize
the absolute value of that sum. This turns out to be surprisingly expressive

to maximize the observed common connection (edge) topology between them. The
topological alignment of two Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks should
thus expose protein pairs with similar interaction partners allowing, for
example, the prediction of common Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Unfortunately, no
network alignment algorithm based on topology alone has been able to achieve
this aim, though those that include sequence similarity have seen some success.
We argue that this failure of topology alone is due to the sparsity and
incompleteness of the PPI network data of almost all species, which provides
the network topology with a small signal-to-noise ratio that is effectively
swamped when sequence information is added to the mix. Here we show that the
weak signal can be detected using multiple stochastic samples of ""good""
topological network alignments, which allows us to observe regions of the two
networks that are robustly aligned across multiple samples. The resulting
Network Alignment Frequency (NAF) strongly correlates with GO-based Resnik
semantic similarity and enables the first successful cross-species predictions
of GO terms based on topology-only network alignments. Our best predictions
have an AUPR of about 0.4, which is competitive with state-of-the-art
algorithms, even when there is no observable sequence similarity and no known
homology relationship. While our results provide only a ""proof of concept"" on
existing network data, we hypothesize that predicting GO terms from
topology-only network alignments will become increasingly practical as the
volume and quality of PPI network data increase.

proposed as the primary gradient-limiting mechanism for tokamak equilibria with
negative triangularity ($\delta$) shaping, preventing access to strong H-mode
regimes when $\delta\ll0$. To understand how this mechanism extrapolates to
reactor conditions, we model the infinite-$n$ ballooning stability as a
function of internal profiles and equilibrium shape using a combination of the
CHEASE and BALOO codes. While the critical $\delta$ required for avoiding
$2^\mathrm{nd}$ stability to high-$n$ modes is observed to depend in a
complicated way on various shaping parameters, including the equilibrium aspect
ratio, elongation and squareness, equilibria with negative triangularity are
robustly prohibited from accessing the $2^\mathrm{nd}$ stability region,
offering the prediction that that negative triangularity reactors should
maintain L-mode-like operation. In order to access high-$n$ $2^\mathrm{nd}$
stability, the local shear over the entire bad curvature region must be
sufficiently negative to overcome curvature destabilization on the low field
side. Scalings of the ballooning-limited pedestal height are provided as a

tensile and bending rigidity contribute substantially to these tissues' elastic
properties. Rigidity percolation has emerged as a important paradigm for
relating these filamentous tissues' mechanics to the concentrations of their
constituents. Past studies have generally considered tuning of networks by
spatially homogeneous variation in concentration, while ignoring structural
correlation. We here introduce a model in which dilute fiber networks are built
in a correlated manner that produces alternating sparse and dense regions. Our
simulations indicate that structural correlation consistently allows tissues to
attain rigidity with less material. We further find that the percolation
threshold varies non-monotonically with the degree of correlation, such that it
decreases with moderate correlation and once more increases for high
correlation. We explain the eventual reentrance in the dependence of the
rigidity percolation threshold on correlation as the consequence of large,
stiff clusters that are too poorly coupled to transmit forces across the
network. Our study offers deeper understanding of how spatial heterogeneity may
enable tissues to robustly adapt to different mechanical contexts.

deviation of the health states and contribute to the stability of mechanical
systems. In practice, very limited target bearing data are available to conduct
EFD, which makes it hard to adapt to the EFD task of new bearings. To address
this problem, many transfer learning based EFD methods utilize historical data
to learn transferable domain knowledge and conduct early fault detection on new
target bearings. However, most existing methods only consider the distribution
drift across different working conditions but ignore the difference between
bearings under the same working condition, which is called Unit-to-Unit
Variability (UtUV). The setting of EFD with limited target data considering
UtUV can be formulated as a Few-shot Anomaly Detection task. Therefore, this
paper proposes a novel EFD method based on meta-learning considering UtUV. The
proposed method can learn a generic metric based on Relation Network (RN) to
measure the similarity between normal data and the new arrival target bearing
data. Besides, the proposed method utilizes a health state embedding strategy
to decrease false alarms. The performance of proposed method is tested on two
bearing datasets. The results show that the proposed method can detect
incipient faults earlier than the baselines with lower false alarms.

advances into the interior as the surface cools, and multiple convective layers
form beneath that convective front. To study layer formation below an outer
convection zone in a similar scenario, we investigate the evolution of a
stably-stratified fluid with a linear composition gradient that is constantly
being cooled from above. We use the Boussinesq approximation in a series of 2D
simulations at low and high Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pr} = 0.5$ and 7),
initialized with constant temperature everywhere, and cooled at different
rates. We find that multiple convective layers form at $\mathrm{Pr} = 7$, {as
the result of an instability in the} diffusive thermal boundary layer below the
outer convection zone. At low Pr, layers do not form because the temperature
gradient within the boundary layer is much smaller than at large Pr and,
consequently, is not large enough to overcome the stabilizing effect of the
composition gradient. For the stratification used in this study, on the
long-term the composition gradient is an ineffective barrier against the
propagation of the outer convection zone and the entire fluid becomes
fully-mixed, whether layers form or not. Our results challenge 1D evolutionary
models of gas giant planets, which predict that layers are long-lived and that
the outer convective envelope stops advancing inwards. We discuss what is
needed for future work to build more realistic models.

Second, an elastic beam structure is built as a proximity graph based on the

elastic beam algorithm is applied to assign forces for each node to determine
the new positions of the circles. Steps two through four are repeated until a

using slip length. Moreover, they are concerned mainly with flat interfaces and
do not directly address the drag computation. In this work, we formulate the
Transpiration-Resistance model in polar coordinates and address the challenge
of computing drag components on rough surfaces. Like slip length, we introduce
two constitutive parameters called shear and pressure correction factors that
encompass information about how the total drag is partitioned into viscous and
pressure components. Computation of these non-empirical parameters does not
necessitate solving additional microscale problems; they can be obtained from

of urbanization. The design of transit schedules is important for the efficient
and sustainable operation of public transit. However, previous studies usually
assume fixed demand patterns and ignore uncertainties in demand, which may
generate transit schedules that are vulnerable to demand variations. To address
demand uncertainty issues inherent in public transit systems, this paper adopts
both stochastic programming (SP) and robust optimization (RO) techniques to
generate robust transit schedules against demand uncertainty. A nominal
(non-robust) optimization model for the transit frequency setting problem
(TFSP) under a single transit line setting is first proposed. The model is then
extended to SP-based and RO-based formulations to incorporate demand
uncertainty. The large-scale origin-destination (OD) matrices for real-world
transit problems make the optimization problems hard to solve. To efficiently
generate robust transit schedules, a Transit Downsizing (TD) approach is
proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We prove that the optimal
objective function of the problem after TD is close to that of the original
problem (i.e., the difference is bounded from above). The proposed models are
tested with real-world transit lines and data from the Chicago Transit
Authority (CTA). Compared to the current transit schedule implemented by CTA,
the nominal TFSP model without considering demand uncertainty reduces
passengers' wait times while increasing in-vehicle travel times. After
incorporating demand uncertainty, both stochastic and robust TFSP models reduce
passengers' wait times and in-vehicle travel times simultaneously. The robust
TFSP model produces transit schedules with better in-vehicle travel times and
worse wait times for passengers compared to the stochastic TFSP model.

Pseudolabel Generation (Intra-PG) is introduced to obtain reliable pseudo
labels within each modality by aggregating information from two models that are
both pre-trained on source data but updated with target data at different
paces. Second, Inter-modal Pseudo-label Refinement (Inter-PR) adaptively

performance. However, these neural models are of a limited adaptability,
resulting in a decline in performance when encountering test examples from a
different dataset or even a different task. The adaptability is particularly
important in the few-shot setting: in many cases, there is only a limited
amount of labeled data available for a target dataset or task, while we may
have access to a richly labeled source dataset or task. However, adapting a
model trained on the abundant source data to a few-shot target dataset or task
is challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Meta-Weight Regulator
(MWR), which is a meta-learning approach that learns to assign weights to the
source examples based on their relevance to the target loss. Specifically, MWR
first trains the model on the uniformly weighted source examples, and measures
the efficacy of the model on the target examples via a loss function. By
iteratively performing a (meta) gradient descent, high-order gradients are
propagated to the source examples. These gradients are then used to update the
weights of source examples, in a way that is relevant to the target
performance. As MWR is model-agnostic, it can be applied to any backbone neural
model. Extensive experiments are conducted with various backbone text matching
models, on four widely used datasets and two tasks. The results demonstrate
that our proposed approach significantly outperforms a number of existing
adaptation methods and effectively improves the cross-dataset and cross-task

investigate connections with low-rank techniques derived from the singular
value decomposition (SVD). We demonstrate that some of the concepts behind
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-neural networks can improve DeepONet's
design and training phases. These ideas lead us to a methodology extension that
we name SVD-DeepONet. Moreover, through multiple SVD analyses, we find that
DeepONet inherits from its projection-based attribute strong inefficiencies in
representing dynamics characterized by symmetries. Inspired by the work on
shifted-POD, we develop flexDeepONet, an architecture enhancement that relies
on a pre-transformation network for generating a moving reference frame and
isolating the rigid components of the dynamics. In this way, the physics can be
represented on a latent space free from rotations, translations, and stretches,
and an accurate projection can be performed to a low-dimensional basis. In
addition to flexibility and interpretability, the proposed perspectives
increase DeepONet's generalization capabilities and computational efficiencies.
For instance, we show flexDeepONet can accurately surrogate the dynamics of 19
variables in a combustion chemistry application by relying on 95% less
trainable parameters than the ones of the vanilla architecture. We argue that
DeepONet and SVD-based methods can reciprocally benefit from each other. In
particular, the flexibility of the former in leveraging multiple data sources

parameters, such as the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Recently, however, we
attempted a microscopic description of synchronization, called topological
synchronization, and showed that chaotic synchronization is, in fact, a
continuous process that starts in low-density areas of the attractor. Here we
analyze the relation between the two emergent phenomena by shifting the
descriptive level of topological synchronization to account for the
multifractal nature of the visited attractors. Namely, we measure the
generalized dimension of the system and monitor how it changes while increasing
the coupling strength. We show that during the gradual process of topological
adjustment in phase space, the multifractal structures of each strange
attractor of the two coupled oscillators continuously converge, taking a
similar form, until complete topological synchronization ensues. According to
our results, chaotic synchronization has a specific trait in various systems,
from continuous systems and discrete maps to high dimensional systems:
synchronization initiates from the sparse areas of the attractor, and it
creates what we termed as the zipper effect, a distinctive pattern in the
multifractal structure of the system that reveals the microscopic buildup of
the synchronization process. Topological synchronization offers, therefore, a
more detailed microscopic description of chaotic synchronization and reveals
new information about the process even in cases of high mismatch parameters.

a span-level bidirectional network which utilizes all possible spans as input

extract triples from aspect-to-opinion and opinion-to-aspect directions. With
these two decoders complementing with each other, the whole network can extract

separation loss to facilitate the downstream task of distinguishing the correct

local position embedding and ancestor embedding. During the decoding, we
explicitly predict the upsampling factor for each point, and the directions and

surge of deep learning. Due to its data-driven nature, existing FAS methods are
sensitive to the noise in the dataset, which will hurdle the learning process.
However, very few works consider noise modeling in FAS. In this work, we
attempt to fill this gap by automatically addressing the noise problem from
both label and data perspectives in a probabilistic manner. Specifically, we
propose a unified framework called Dual Probabilistic Modeling (DPM), with two
dedicated modules, DPM-LQ (Label Quality aware learning) and DPM-DQ (Data
Quality aware learning). Both modules are designed based on the assumption that
data and label should form coherent probabilistic distributions. DPM-LQ is able
to produce robust feature representations without overfitting to the
distribution of noisy semantic labels. DPM-DQ can eliminate data noise from
`False Reject' and `False Accept' during inference by correcting the prediction
confidence of noisy data based on its quality distribution. Both modules can be
incorporated into existing deep networks seamlessly and efficiently.
Furthermore, we propose the generalized DPM to address the noise problem in
practical usage without the need of semantic annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that this probabilistic modeling can 1) significantly improve the
accuracy, and 2) make the model robust to the noise in real-world datasets.
Without bells and whistles, our proposed DPM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple standard FAS benchmarks.

ballistic centrifugal barrier, which places the shock at $r_\mathrm{shock} =
0.5 r_\mathrm{c}$, i.e, inward of $r_\mathrm{c}$, rather than outward as given

guidance of proper ""anchors"" in the form of either short text or video clips.
Starting from one target face image, with the editing direction decoded from
the low-rank space, its micromotion features can be represented as simple as an
affine transformation over its latent feature. Perhaps more surprisingly, such
micromotion subspace, even learned from just single target face, can be
painlessly transferred to other unseen face images, even those from vastly
different domains (such as oil painting, cartoon, and sculpture faces). It
demonstrates that the local feature geometry corresponding to one type of

contribution we describe how quasar accretion disk spectral energy distribution
(SED) templates, parameterized by the black hole (BH) mass, Eddington ratio,
and spin can be used to estimate their total radiated luminosity. To estimate
the bolometric luminosity of AGN, we integrate the accretion disk SEDs from
1$\mu$m to 10keV. Our approach self-consistently covers any gaps in
observations and does not include reprocessed emission from the torus. The
accretion disk SED, and consequently the bolometric correction inferred from
it, strongly depend on the BH mass, the Eddington ratio, and spin. In
particular, the bolometric correction in the visible bands
(5100$\,\mathring{A}$ and 3000$\,\mathring{A}$) strongly depends on BH mass,
and at X-ray strongly depends on the Eddington ratio. At wavelengths closer to
the peak of the accretion disk SED the dependence becomes weaker. Additionally,
maximally-rotating (spin = 1) quasars require a higher bolometric correction
than their non-rotating (spin = 0) counterparts at all wavelengths. The SEDs
and the bolometric correction presented in this work can determine the
radiative power of any sample of radio-quiet to radio-loud Type 1 AGN with

describe two Alfv\'en resonators, one of which is formed in the ionosphere, and
the second presumably exists in the Earth's radiation belt. The existence of an
ionospheric resonator is justified theoretically and confirmed by numerous
observations. The second resonator is located between reflection points located
high above the Earth symmetrically with respect to the plane of the geomagnetic
equator. Keywords: Alfv\'en velocity, dispersion law, group velocity, geometric

to clients' limited system resources. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble
knowledge transfer method named Fed-ET in which small models (different in
architecture) are trained on clients, and used to train a larger model at the

trained on clients' highly heterogeneous data. Cognizant of this property,
Fed-ET uses a weighted consensus distillation scheme with diversity
regularization that efficiently extracts reliable consensus from the ensemble
while improving generalization by exploiting the diversity within the ensemble.
We show the generalization bound for the ensemble of weighted models trained on
heterogeneous datasets that supports the intuition of Fed-ET. Our experiments
on image and language tasks show that Fed-ET significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art FL algorithms with fewer communicated parameters, and is also
robust against high data-heterogeneity.

to low-level correlations between simple features and specific output labels,
leading to overfitting and lack of generalization. To mitigate this problem, a
common practice is to balance datasets by adding new instances or by filtering
out ""easy"" instances (Sakaguchi et al., 2020), culminating in a recent proposal
to eliminate single-word correlations altogether (Gardner et al., 2021). In
this opinion paper, we identify that despite these efforts,
increasingly-powerful models keep exploiting ever-smaller spurious
correlations, and as a result even balancing all single-word features is
insufficient for mitigating all of these correlations. In parallel, a truly
balanced dataset may be bound to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and
miss important signal encoding common sense and world knowledge. We highlight
several alternatives to dataset balancing, focusing on enhancing datasets with
richer contexts, allowing models to abstain and interact with users, and
turning from large-scale fine-tuning to zero- or few-shot setups.

  Development",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As one of the most well-known programmer Q&A websites, Stack Overflow (i.e.,
SO) is serving tens of thousands of developers every day. Previous work has
shown that many developers reuse the code snippets on SO when they find an
answer (from SO) that functionally matches the programming problem they
encounter in their development activities. To study how programmers reuse code
on SO during project development, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study.
First, to capture the development activities of programmers, we collect 342,148
modified code snippets in commits from 793 open-source Java projects, and these
modified code can reflect the programming problems encountered during
development. We also collect the code snippets from 1,355,617 posts on SO.
Then, we employ CCFinder to detect the code clone between the modified code
from commits and the code from SO, and further analyze the code reuse when
programmer solves a programming problem during development. We count the code
reuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in
different years, the results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32%,
and the maximum is 8.38%. The code reuse ratio in project commits has increased
year by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established project
is higher than that of old projects. We also find that some projects reuse the
code snippets from many years ago. Additionally, we find that experienced
developers seem to be more likely to reuse the knowledge on SO. Moreover, we
find that the code reuse ratio in bug-related commits (6.67%) is slightly
higher than that of in non-bug-related commits (6.59%). Furthermore, we also
find that the code reuse ratio (14.44%) in Java class files that have undergone
multiple modifications is more than double the overall code reuse ratio
(6.32%).

they do something ""good"" for their fellow human. Two constructs - perceived
extrinsic warm-glow (PEWG) and perceived intrinsic warm-glow (PIWG) - were
incorporated into the TAM3 model to measure the two dimensions of
user-experienced warm-glow, forming what we refer to as the TAM3 + WG model. An
experimental approach was taken to evaluate the suitability of the proposed
model (i.e., TAM3 + WG). A vignette was created to present users with a
hypothetical technology designed to evoke warm-glow in participants. Our TAM3 +
WG model was found to be superior in terms of fit to the TAM3 model.
Furthermore, the PEWG and PIWG constructs were confirmed to be unique within
the original TAM3 model. The findings indicate that the factors that have the
greatest influence on consumer decisions are (in decreasing order) perceived
usefulness (PU), PIWG, subjective norm (SN), and PEWG. Additionally, a higher
PEWG resulted in the technology being perceived as more useful. In other words,
both extrinsic and intrinsic warm-glow play a prominent role in user decisions
as to whether or not to adopt a particular technology.

transport [JST19], and bipartite matching [AJJ+22]. We develop efficient
near-linear time, high-accuracy solvers for regularized variants of these
games. Beyond the immediate applications of such solvers for computing Sinkhorn
distances, a prominent tool in machine learning, we show that these solvers can
be used to obtain improved running times for maintaining a (fractional)
$\epsilon$-approximate maximum matching in a dynamic decremental bipartite
graph against an adaptive adversary. We give a generic framework which reduces
this dynamic matching problem to solving regularized graph-structured
optimization problems to high accuracy. Through our reduction framework, our
regularized box-simplex game solver implies a new algorithm for dynamic
decremental bipartite matching in total time $\tilde{O}(m \cdot
\epsilon^{-3})$, from an initial graph with $m$ edges and $n$ nodes. We further
show how to use recent advances in flow optimization [CKL+22] to improve our
runtime to $m^{1 + o(1)} \cdot \epsilon^{-2}$, thereby demonstrating the
versatility of our reduction-based approach. These results improve upon the
previous best runtime of $\tilde{O}(m \cdot \epsilon^{-4})$ [BGS20] and
illustrate the utility of using regularized optimization problem solvers for
designing dynamic algorithms.

Interestingly, deformational coupling of the shell to the core can determine
the resulting overall appearance in response to the forces. We address various

realized by wrapping a cord around the equator of a macroscopic model system

reveals the fundamental information-theoretic limitation of any data-based

The second set of results proposes the $K$-markets empirical revenue

ERM strategies achieve the optimal rate of convergence in revenue to that
generated by their respective true-distribution 3PD and uniform pricing optima.

indicate that the difference in transmission efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 variants
cannot be fully explained by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bond
interactions, van der Waals interactions, internal energy, and nonpolar
solvation energies. Here, we demonstrate that low-entropy regions of hydration
shells around proteins drive hydrophobic attraction between shape-matched
low-entropy regions of the hydration shells, which essentially coordinates
protein-protein binding in rotational-configurational space of mutual
orientations and determines the binding affinity. An innovative method was used
to identify the low-entropy regions of the hydration shells of the RBDs of
multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and the ACE2. We observed integral low-entropy
regions of hydration shells covering the binding sites of the RBDs and matching
in shape to the low-entropy region of hydration shell at the binding site of
the ACE2. The RBD-ACE2 binding is thus found to be guided by hydrophobic
collapse between the shape-matched low-entropy regions of the hydration shells.
A measure of the low-entropy of the hydration shells can be obtained by
counting the number of hydrophilic groups expressing hydrophilicity within the
binding sites. The low-entropy level of hydration shells at the binding site of
a spike protein is found to be an important indicator of the contagiousness of

neural networks. This often requires a high computational overhead to evaluate
a number of candidate networks from the set of all possible networks in the
search space during the search. Prediction of the networks' performance can
alleviate this high computational overhead by mitigating the need for
evaluating every candidate network. Developing such a predictor typically
requires a large number of evaluated architectures which may be difficult to
obtain. We address this challenge by proposing a novel evolutionary-based NAS
strategy, Predictor-assisted E-NAS (PRE-NAS), which can perform well even with
an extremely small number of evaluated architectures. PRE-NAS leverages new
evolutionary search strategies and integrates high-fidelity weight inheritance
over generations. Unlike one-shot strategies, which may suffer from bias in the
evaluation due to weight sharing, offspring candidates in PRE-NAS are
topologically homogeneous, which circumvents bias and leads to more accurate
predictions. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces
show that PRE-NAS can outperform state-of-the-art NAS methods. With only a
single GPU searching for 0.6 days, competitive architecture can be found by
PRE-NAS which achieves 2.40% and 24% test error rates on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet

Most existing approaches emphasize the contrastive relations among videos,

sometimes leads to sub-optimal solutions due to inconsistent domains of
different tasks. To address the above issues, we propose a novel action
recognition pre-training framework, which exploits human-centered prior
knowledge that generates more informative representation, and avoids the
conflict between multiple tasks by using task-dependent representations.
Specifically, we distill knowledge from a human parsing model to enrich the
semantic capability of representation. In addition, we combine knowledge
distillation with contrastive learning to constitute a task-dependent
multi-task framework. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on two popular
benchmarks for action recognition task, i.e., UCF101 and HMDB51, verifying the

consider the relationship between a span and other entities or phrases, which
is helpful in the NER task. Besides, span-based methods have trouble predicting
long entities due to limited span enumeration length. To mitigate these issues,
we present the Propose-and-Refine Network (PnRNet), a two-stage set prediction

generate some coarse entity predictions as entity proposals. In the refine
stage, proposals interact with each other, and richer contextual information is
incorporated into the proposal representations. The refined proposal
representations are used to re-predict entity boundaries and classes. In this
way, errors in coarse proposals can be eliminated, and the boundary prediction
is no longer constrained by the span enumeration length limitation.
Additionally, we build multi-scale sentence representations, which better model
the hierarchical structure of sentences and provide richer contextual
information than token-level representations. Experiments show that PnRNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four nested NER datasets and one flat

common with polarimeters working at other energy bands, the peculiar
characteristics and performance of these devices require a specific approach.
We will start from the analysis of the raw data read-out from this kind of
instruments, that is, the image of the track of the photoelectron. We will
briefly present how such images are processed with highly-specialized
algorithms to extract all the information collected by the instrument. These
include energy, time of arrival and, possibly, absorption point of the photon,
in addition to the initial direction of emission of the photoelectron. The last
is the quantity relevant for polarimetry, and we will present different methods
to obtain the polarization degree and angle from it. A simple method, used
extensively especially during the development phase of X-ray photoelectric gas
polarimeters, is based on the construction and fitting of the azimuthal

reasons to prefer an analysis based on Stokes parameters, especially when one
wants to analyze measurements of real, i.e., not laboratory, sources. These are
quantities commonly used at all wavelengths because they are additive, and then
operations like background subtraction or the application of calibration are
trivial to apply. We will summarize how Stokes parameters can be used to adapt

deterministic global optimization of membrane processes with accurate transport

heuristics or short-cut models. The ANNs are trained based on data generated by
a one-dimensional extended Nernst-Planck ion transport model and extended to a
more accurate two-dimensional distribution of the membrane module, that
captures the filtration-related decreasing retention of salt. We simultaneously
design the membrane and plant layout yielding optimal membrane module synthesis

control the synthetic mechanisms by picking style parameters with the guidance
of two specifically designed rewards. The synthetic training images with

produce better erasing outputs, a triplet erasure loss is designed to enforce
the refinement stage to recover background textures. Moreover, we provide a new

texts and is more challenging for the text erasing task. The proposed method
has been extensively evaluated with both PosterErase and the widely-used

using the RGB (red-green-blue) and RAW optical images. For RGB images, the
slope of 2D flake (MoS2, WSe2, graphene) intensity vs. substrate intensity is
extracted from optical images with varying lamp power. The intensity slope
identifies layer number and is system independent. For RAW images, intensity
slopes and intensity ratios are completely system and intensity independent.
Intensity slope (for RGB) and intensity ratio (for RAW) are thus universal
parameters for identifying layer number. A Fresnel-reflectance-based optical
model provides an excellent match with experiments. Further, we have created a
MATLAB-based graphical user interface that can identify layer number rapidly.

lowest-order mixed method is the most popular one for miscible flow in porous
media. The method is based on a linear Lagrange approximation to the
concentration and the zero-order Raviart-Thomas approximation to the
pressure/velocity. However, the optimal error estimate for the lowest-order
characteristics-mixed FEM has not been presented although numerous effort has
been made in last several decades. In all previous works, only first-order
accuracy in spatial direction was proved under certain time-step and mesh size
restrictions. The main purpose of this paper is to establish optimal error
estimates, $i.e.$, the second-order in $L^2$-norm for the concentration and the
first-order for the pressure/velocity, while the concentration is more
important physical component for the underlying model. For this purpose, an
elliptic quasi-projection is introduced in our analysis to clean up the
pollution of the numerical velocity through the nonlinear dispersion-diffusion
tensor and the concentration-dependent viscosity. Moreover, the numerical
pressure/velocity of the second-order accuracy can be obtained by re-solving
the (elliptic) pressure equation at a given time level with a higher-order

Learning the semantics and morphology of code-mixed language remains a key

distinguish the stellar evolutionary stages. Based on the LAMOST Data Release 7

for giant stars, which contain the largest number of Li-rich giants. The red
giant stars are classified into three stages of Red Giant Branch (RGB), Primary
Red Clump (PRC), and Secondary Red Clump (SRC) relying on the estimated
asteroseismic parameters. In the statistical analysis of the properties (i.e.
stellar mass, carbon, nitrogen, Li-rich distribution, and frequency) of Li-rich

have suggested that oddball GRBs do exist, and multiple criteria (prompt
emission properties, supernova/kilonova associations, and host galaxy
properties) rather than burst duration only are needed to classify GRBs
physically. A previously reported long-duration burst, GRB 060614, could be
viewed as a short GRB with extended emission if it were observed at a larger
distance and was associated with a kilonova-like feature. As a result, it
belongs to the Type-I (compact star merger) GRB category and is likely of the
binary neutron star merger origin. Here we report a peculiar long-duration
gamma-ray burst, GRB 211211A, whose prompt emission properties in many aspects
differ from all known Type-I GRBs, yet its multi-band observations suggest a
non-massive-star origin. In particular, significant excess emission in both
optical and near-infrared wavelengths has been discovered, which resembles
kilonova emission as observed in some Type-I GRBs. These observations point
towards a new progenitor type of GRBs. A scenario invoking a white
dwarf-neutron star merger with a post-merger magnetar engine provides a
self-consistent interpretation for all the observations, including prompt
gamma-rays, early X-ray afterglow, as well as the engine-fed kilonova emission.

Cognitive radio technology has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the
spectrum scarcity bottleneck. Through this technology, secondary users (SUs)
sense the spectrum opportunities free from primary users (PUs), and
opportunistically take advantage of these (temporarily) idle portions, known as
spectrum holes. In this correspondence, we consider a variant of the cognitive
radio resource allocation problem posed by Martinovic et al. in 2017. The
distinguishing feature of this version of the problem is that each SU, due to
its hardware limitations, imposes the requirement that the to-be-aggregated
spectrum holes cannot be arbitrarily far from each other. We call this
restriction as the Maximal Aggregation Range (MAR) constraint, and refer to
this variant of the problem as the MAR-constrained hole assignment problem. The
problem can be formalized as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We
propose a novel binary integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to the
problem. The number of constraints in this formulation is the number of
spectrum holes plus the number of SUs. On the other hand, the number of binary
decision variables in the formulation can be prohibitively large, as for each
legitimate spectrum allocation to each SU, one variable is needed. We propose a
branch-and-price (B&P) framework to tackle this challenge. This framework is in
fact a branch-and-bound procedure in which at each node of the search tree, we
utilize the so-called (delayed) column generation technique for solving the LP
relaxation of the corresponding subproblem. As evidenced by the numerical
results, the LP relaxation bounds are very tight. This allows for a very
effective pruning of the search space. Compared to the previously suggested

faced with the task of solving a business problem using data-driven methods
such as machine learning (ML) algorithms. Deployment of ML within large
software systems brings new challenges that are not addressed by standard
engineering practices and as a result businesses observe high rate of ML
deployment project failures. Data Oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging
approach that can support data scientists and software developers when
addressing such challenges. However, there is a lack of clarity about how DOA
systems should be implemented in practice. This paper proposes to consider
Flow-Based Programming (FBP) as a paradigm for creating DOA applications. We
empirically evaluate FBP in the context of ML deployment on four applications
that represent typical data science projects. We use Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA) as a baseline for comparison. Evaluation is done with
respect to different application domains, ML deployment stages, and code
quality metrics. Results reveal that FBP is a suitable paradigm for data
collection and data science tasks, and is able to simplify data collection and
discovery when compared with SOA. We discuss the advantages of FBP as well as
the gaps that need to be addressed to increase FBP adoption as a standard
design paradigm for DOA.

at a meta-level for strategy evaluation in two-agent reinforcement learning,
grounded on sink equilibrium. The metrics rank the strategies of a single

commitment. Then, in order to find the preferred strategies under the metrics,

strictly best-response and weakly better-response self-plays. By modeling
learning processes as walks over joint-strategy response digraphs, we prove
that the learnt strategies by two variants are preferred under two metrics,

the genuine quantum brachistochrone problem involves a variational problem with

formulation not only simplifies the derivation of the quantum brachistochrone

the speed of evolution under constraints is reduced with respect to the
unrestricted case. In addition, we find that solving the quantum
brachistochrone equation is closely connected to solving the dynamics of the
Lagrange multipliers, which is in general governed by nonlinear differential
equations. Their numerical integration allows generating time-extremal
trajectories. Furthermore, when the restricted operators form a closed
subalgebra, the Lagrange multipliers become constant and the optimal
Hamiltonian takes a concise form. The new class of analytically solvable models
for the quantum brachistochrone problem opens up the possibility of applying it

quantum speed limits, and advancing significantly the quantum state and gate

representation of graphs. In the tree representation, messages propagate upward
from the leaf nodes to the root node, and each node preserves its initial
information prior to receiving information from its child nodes (neighbors). We
formulate a general propagation rule following the nature of message passing in
the tree to update a node's feature by aggregating its initial feature and its
neighbor nodes' updated features. Two graph representation learning models are
proposed within this GTNet architecture - Graph Tree Attention Network (GTAN)

state-of-the-art performance on several popular benchmark datasets. Unlike the
vanilla Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Graph Convolution Network (GCN) which
have the ""over-smoothing"" issue, the proposed GTAN and GTCN models can go deep
as demonstrated by comprehensive experiments and rigorous theoretical analysis.

judiciary. Smart contracts are used occasionally in Bitcoin and are prevalent
in Ethereum. Public quantum money improves upon cash we use today, yet the
current constructions do not enable smart contracts. In this work, we define
and introduce quantum payment schemes, and show how to implement prudent
contracts -- a non-trivial subset of the functionality that a network such as
Ethereum provides. Examples discussed include: multi-signature wallets in which
funds can be spent by any 2-out-of-3 owners; restricted accounts that can send
funds only to designated destinations; and ""colored coins"" that can represent
stocks that can be freely traded, and their owner would receive dividends. Our
approach is not as universal as the one used in Ethereum since we do not reach
a consensus regarding the state of a ledger. We call our proposal prudent
contracts to reflect this.
  The main building block is either quantum tokens for digital signatures
(Ben-David and Sattath QCrypt'17, Coladangelo et al. Crypto'21), semi-quantum
tokens for digital signatures (Shmueli'22) or one-shot signatures (Amos et al.
STOC'20). The solution has all the benefits of public quantum money: no mining
is necessary, and the security model is standard (e.g., it is not susceptible
to 51\% attacks, as in Bitcoin).
  Our one-shot signature construction can be used to upgrade the Bitcoin
network to a quantum payment scheme. Notable advantages of this approach are:
transactions are locally verifiable and without latency, the throughput is
unbounded, and most importantly, it would remove the need for Bitcoin mining.
Our approach requires a universal large-scale quantum computer and long-term
quantum memory; hence we do not expect it to be implementable in the next few
years.

Previous works have employed many hand-crafted resources to bring

the de-facto standard in NLP since they learn generic knowledge from a large

Nevertheless, there are few works to explore it. In this paper, we probe simile
knowledge from PLMs to solve the SI and SG tasks in the unified framework of
simile triple completion for the first time. The backbone of our framework is
to construct masked sentences with manual patterns and then predict the
candidate words in the masked position. In this framework, we adopt a secondary
training process (Adjective-Noun mask Training) with the masked language model

to improve the quality of predicted words. Finally, automatic and human

cosmological studies, as it can help derive constraints on a collection of
cosmological parameters. It is however subject to various effects from the
baryonic physics inside galaxy clusters, which may bias the obtained
cosmological constraints. Among different aspects of the baryonic physics, in
this paper we focus on the impact of the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. We
analyse the hydrostatic mass bias $B$, constraining a possible mass and
redshift evolution of this quantity and its impact on the cosmological
constraints. To that end we consider cluster observations of the {\it
Planck}-ESZ sample and evaluate the gas mass fraction using X-ray counterpart
observations. We show a degeneracy between the redshift dependence of the bias
and cosmological parameters. In particular we find a $3.8 \sigma$ evidence for
a redshift dependence of the bias when assuming a {\it Planck} prior on
$\Omega_m$. On the other hand, assuming a constant mass bias would lead to the
extreme large value of $\Omega_m > 0.849$. We however show that our results are
entirely dependent on the cluster sample we consider. In particular, the mass
and redshift trends that we find for the lowest mass-redshift and highest
mass-redshift clusters of our sample are not compatible. Nevertheless, in all
the analyses we find a value for the amplitude of the bias that is consistent
with $B \sim 0.8$, as expected from hydrodynamical simulations and local
measurements, but still in tension with the low value of $B \sim 0.6$ derived
from the combination of cosmic microwave background primary anisotropies with
cluster number counts.

(e.g., CONCERTO), we need realistic simulations of the sub-mm extragalactic sky
in spectroscopy. We present a new version of the SIDES simulation including the
main sub-mm lines around 1mm (CO, [CII], [CI]). This approach successfully
reproduces the observed line luminosity functions. We then use our simulation
to generate CONCERTO-like cubes (125-305GHz) and forecast the power spectra of
the fluctuations caused by the various astrophysical components at those
frequencies. Depending on our assumptions on the relation between star
formation rate and [CII] luminosity, and the star formation history, our
predictions of the z~6 [CII] power spectrum vary by two orders of magnitude.
This highlights how uncertain the predictions are and how important future
measurements will be to improve our understanding of this early epoch. SIDES
can reproduce the CO shot noise recently measured at ~100 GHz by the mmIME
experiment. Finally, we compare the contribution of the different astrophysical
components at various redshift to the power spectra. The continuum is by far
the brightest, by a factor of 3 to 100 depending on the frequency. At 300GHz,
the CO foreground power spectrum is higher than the [CII] one for our base
scenario. At lower frequency, the contrast between [CII] and extragalactic
foregrounds is even worse. Masking the known galaxies from deep surveys should
allow to reduce the foregrounds to 20% of the [CII] power spectrum up to z~6.5.
However, this masking method will not be sufficient at higher redshifts. The
code and the products of our simulation are released publicly and can be used
for both intensity mapping experiments and sub-mm continuum and line surveys.

memory architectures. As a result, there is a growing need to utilize these
architectures by introducing shared memory parallelization schemes to software
applications. OpenMP is the most comprehensive API that implements such
schemes, characterized by a readable interface. Nevertheless, introducing
OpenMP into code is challenging due to pervasive pitfalls in management of
parallel shared memory. To facilitate the performance of this task, many
source-to-source (S2S) compilers have been created over the years, tasked with
inserting OpenMP directives into code automatically. In addition to having
limited robustness to their input format, these compilers still do not achieve
satisfactory coverage and precision in locating parallelizable code and
generating appropriate directives. In this work, we propose leveraging recent
advances in ML techniques, specifically in natural language processing (NLP),
to replace S2S compilers altogether. We create a database (corpus), Open-OMP,
specifically for this goal. Open-OMP contains over 28,000 code snippets, half
of which contain OpenMP directives while the other half do not need
parallelization at all with high probability. We use the corpus to train
systems to automatically classify code segments in need of parallelization, as
well as suggest individual OpenMP clauses. We train several transformer models,
named PragFormer, for these tasks, and show that they outperform
statistically-trained baselines and automatic S2S parallelization compilers in
both classifying the overall need for an OpenMP directive and the introduction

missing edges is a fundamental and important task for knowledge graph
reasoning. The query embedding method is proposed to answer these queries by
jointly encoding queries and entities to the same embedding space. Then the
answer entities are selected according to the similarities between the entity
embeddings and the query embedding. As the answers to a complex query are
obtained from a combination of logical operations over sub-queries, the
embeddings of the answer entities may not always follow a uni-modal

retrieve a set of diverse answers from the embedding space using a single and
concentrated query representation such as a vector or a hyper-rectangle. To
better cope with queries with diversified answers, we propose Query2Particles
(Q2P), a complex KG query answering method. Q2P encodes each query into
multiple vectors, named particle embeddings. By doing so, the candidate answers
can be retrieved from different areas over the embedding space using the
maximal similarities between the entity embeddings and any of the particle
embeddings. Meanwhile, the corresponding neural logic operations are defined to
support its reasoning over arbitrary first-order logic queries. The experiments

a selection process and overlook the results that generate negative outcomes.
We observe that this bias could be present in the popular MS MARCO dataset,
given that annotators could not find answers to 38--45% of the queries, leading
to these queries being discarded in training and evaluation processes. Although
we find that some discarded queries in MS MARCO are ill-defined or otherwise
unanswerable, many are valid questions that could be answered had the
collection been annotated more completely (around two thirds using modern
ranking techniques). This survivability problem distorts the MS MARCO
collection in several ways. We find that it affects the natural distribution of
queries in terms of the type of information needed. When used for evaluation,
we find that the bias likely yields a significant distortion of the absolute
performance scores observed. Finally, given that MS MARCO is frequently used
for model training, we train models based on subsets of MS MARCO that simulates
more survivorship bias. We find that models trained in this setting are up to
9.9% worse when evaluated on versions of the dataset with more complete
annotations, and up to 3.5% worse at zero-shot transfer. Our findings are
complementary to other recent suggestions for further annotation of MS MARCO,
but with a focus on discarded queries. Code and data for reproducing the

Transient amplifiers are networks representing population structures which
shift the balance between natural selection and random drift. Thus, amplifiers
are highly relevant for understanding the relationships between spatial
structures and evolutionary dynamics. We study an iterative procedure to
identify transient amplifiers for death-Birth updating. The algorithm starts
with a regular input graph and iteratively removes edges until desired
structures are achieved. Thus, a sequence of candidate graphs is obtained. The
edge removals are guided by quantities derived from the sequence of candidate
graphs. Moreover, we are interested in the Laplacian spectra of the candidate
graphs and analyze the iterative process by its spectral dynamics. The results
show that although transient amplifiers for death-Birth updating are rare, a
substantial number of them can be obtained by the proposed procedure. The
graphs identified share structural properties and have some similarity to
dumbbell and barbell graphs. Also, the spectral dynamics possesses
characteristic features useful for deducing links between structural and

direction of the cluster NGC 2345 using the multi-band optical polarimetric
observations. For the majority of the stars, the observed polarization is found
to be due to the interstellar medium with average values of maximum
polarization and wavelength corresponding to it as 1.55% and 0.58 $\mu m$,
respectively. This reveals a similar size distribution of dust grains to that
in the general interstellar medium in the direction of NGC 2345. Alteration of
dust properties near the distance of 1.2 kpc towards the direction of NGC 2345
has been noticed. The dust grains located beyond this distance are found to be
aligned with the Galactic magnetic field, whereas a dispersion in orientation
of the dust grains lying in the foreground of this distance is found.
Polarizing efficiency of grains in this direction is found to be close to the
average efficiency for our Galaxy. The decreased grain size along with the
increased polarizing efficiency towards the core region of the cluster
indicates the local radiation field is higher within the cluster which is
responsible for the increased alignment efficiency of small grains. The
wavelength of maximum polarization (associated with the average size of aligned
grains) is also found to increase with extinction and reduces with the increase
in polarizing efficiency, which can be explained by the radiative torque
alignment mechanism.

Despite its
importance, very little is known of the properties and mechanisms underlying
this crucial urban process. Here, we capitalize on $\sim$ 50 million
individuals' smartphone data from 234 Chinese cities to show that urban
commuting obeys remarkable regularities. These regularities can be generalized
as two laws: (i) the scale-invariance of the average commuting distance across
cities, which is a long-awaited validation of Marchetti's constant conjecture,
and (ii) a universal inverted U-shape of the commuting distance as a function
of the distance from the city centre within cities, indicating that the city
centre's attraction is bounded. Motivated by such empirical findings, we
develop a simple urban growth model that connects individual-level mobility
choices with macroscopic urban spatial structure and faithfully explains both
commuting laws. Our results further show that the scale-invariants of human
mobility will ultimately lead to the polycentric transition in cities, which
could be used to better inform urban development strategies.

reduces the impact of aliasing. Therewith, it allows for capturing details
which would not be possible with state-of-the-art sensors of the same number of

  Overall, XGB and FFNNs were competitive, with FFNNs showing better
performance in smooth models and tree-based boosting algorithms performing
better in non-smooth models. This conclusion held generally for predictive
performance, identification of important variables, and determining correct

FFNNs generally had less over-fitting, as measured by the difference in

XGB was often small. RFs did not perform well in general, confirming the
findings in the literature. All models exhibited different degrees of bias seen
in PDPs, but the bias was especially problematic for RFs. The extent of the
biases varied with correlation among predictors, response type, and data set

of definition of rationality across different subjects varies. Several theories
(e.g., game theory) initially evolved on the basis that agents (e.g., humans)
are perfectly rational. One interpretation of perfect rationality is that
agents always make the optimal decision which maximizes their expected
utilities. However, subsequently this assumption was relaxed to include bounded
rationality where agents have limitations in terms of computing resources and
biases which prevents them to take the optimal decision. However, with recent
advances in (quantum) computing, artificial intelligence (AI), science and
technology etc., has led to the thought that perhaps the concept of rationality
would be augmented with machine intelligence which will enable agents to take
decision optimally with higher regularity. However, there are divergent views
on this topic. The paper attempts to put forward a recent survey (last five
years) of research on these divergent views. These viewsmay be grouped into
three schools of thoughts. The first school is the one which is sceptical of
progress of AI and believes that human intelligencewill always supersede
machine intelligence. The second school of thought thinks that advent of AI and
advances in computing will help in better understanding of bounded rationality.
Third school of thought believes that bounds of bounded rationality will be
extended by advances in AI and various other fields. This survey hopes to
provide a starting point for further research.

technologies for processing, transmitting or displaying image signals rely on
the samples being available on a regular grid. Thus, it is of great importance
to reconstruct the image on this regular grid so that the reconstruction comes
closest to the case that the signal has been originally acquired on the regular

solving this challenging task. This algorithm reconstructs image signals by
exploiting the property that small areas of images can be represented sparsely

the Optical Transfer Function of imaging systems, a sparse model of the signal

phase velocity set by each mode propagation index which determines mode density
and internal energy contribution. All photons emitted after striking an
interface obliquely are refracted. Their exit intensities are then irreversible
except when weak internal attenuation occurs. At low temperature attenuation
index is small so reversibility is approximate. As temperature rises refraction
direction varies. Total emission remains reversible after transitioning through
a non equilibrium state with no other heat inputs. In equilibrium the densities
of excitations that create and annihilate photons are in balance with photon
densities while emissivity depends on both indices and internal incident
direction. Modelled exit intensities from pure water and crystalline silica
contain strong resonant intensities and match data accurately. Intrinsic
resonances formed within liquids and compounds are due to photon modes
hybridising with localized excitations, including molecular oscillations and
the anharmonic component of lattice distortions. They explain the many resonant
spectral intensities seen in remote sensing. Each hybrid oscillator is a
photonic virtual bound state whose energy fluctuates between levels separated
by mode energy. Refraction induces solid angle changes and often anomalous
refraction while thermal recycling of internally reflected photons modifies

not only sparse, but also (approximately) low-rank under FFT, which we have
verified by numerical tests and theoretical analysis. Based on this fact, we
propose a novel TV regularization to simultaneously characterize the sparsity

only imposes sparsity on the gradient map itself, but also penalize the rank on
the gradient map after Fourier transform along the spectral dimension. It
naturally encodes the sparsity and lowrank priors of the gradient map, and thus
is expected to reflect the inherent structure of the original image more
faithfully. Further, we use LRSTV to replace conventional SSTV and embed it in
the HSI processing model to improve its performance. Experimental results on
multiple public data-sets with heavy mixed noise show that the proposed model

pooling methods commonly consist of two stages, i.e., selecting the top-ranked

representation. However, local structural information of the removed nodes
would be inevitably dropped in these methods, due to the inherent coupling of
nodes (location) and their features (signals). In this paper, we propose an
enhanced three-stage method via lifting, named LiftPool, to improve
hierarchical graph representation by maximally preserving the local structural
information in graph pooling. LiftPool introduces an additional stage of graph
lifting before graph coarsening to preserve the local information of the
removed nodes and decouple the processes of node removing and feature
reduction. Specifically, for each node to be removed, its local information is
obtained by subtracting the global information aggregated from its neighboring
preserved nodes. Subsequently, this local information is aligned and propagated
to the preserved nodes to alleviate information loss in graph coarsening.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed LiftPool is localized and
permutation-invariant. The proposed graph lifting structure is general to be
integrated with existing downsampling-based graph pooling methods. Evaluations
on benchmark graph datasets show that LiftPool substantially outperforms the

methodology for the analysis of complex time series, now known as Ordinal
Analysis. The ordinal methodology is based on the computation of symbols (known
as ordinal patterns) which are defined in terms of the temporal ordering of
data points in a time series, and whose probabilities are known as ordinal
probabilities. With the ordinal probabilities, the Shannon entropy can be
calculated, which is the permutation entropy. Since it was proposed, the
ordinal method has found applications in fields as diverse as biomedicine and
climatology. However, some properties of ordinal probabilities are still not
fully understood, and how to combine the ordinal approach of feature extraction
with machine learning techniques for model identification, time series
classification or forecasting remains a challenge. The objective of this
perspective article is to present some recent advances and to discuss some open
problems.

  Optimization for Salient Points",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature detection is an important procedure for image matching, where
unsupervised feature detection methods are the detection approaches that have
been mostly studied recently, including the ones that are based on
repeatability requirement to define loss functions, and the ones that attempt
to use descriptor matching to drive the optimization of the pipelines. For the
former type, mean square error (MSE) is usually used which cannot provide
strong constraint for training and can make the model easy to be stuck into the
collapsed solution. For the later one, due to the down sampling operation and
the expansion of receptive fields, the details can be lost for local
descriptors can be lost, making the constraint not fine enough. Considering the
issues above, we propose to combine both ideas, which including three aspects.
1) We propose to achieve fine constraint based on the requirement of
repeatability while coarse constraint with guidance of deep convolution
features. 2) To address the issue that optimization with MSE is limited,
entropy-based cost function is utilized, both soft cross-entropy and
self-information. 3) With the guidance of convolution features, we define the
cost function from both positive and negative sides. Finally, we study the
effect of each modification proposed and experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive results over the state-of-the-art approaches.

studies of 3 GCs to create stacked FUV-optical CMDs to highlight the
features/peculiarities found in the different evolutionary sequences. The FUV
(F148W) detected stellar populations of 11 GCs comprises 2,816 Horizontal

blue HB color extension obtained from F148W$-$G color and the number of FUV
detected EHB candidates are strongly correlated with the maximum internal
Helium (He) variation within each GC, suggesting that the FUV-optical plane is
the most sensitive to He abundance variations in the HB. We discuss the

research. With memory disaggregation, data center compute nodes can directly
access memory on adjacent nodes and are therefore able to overcome local memory
restrictions, introducing a new data management paradigm for distributed
computing. This paper proposes and demonstrates a memory disaggregated
in-memory object store framework for big data applications by leveraging the
newly introduced ThymesisFlow memory disaggregation system. The framework
extends the functionality of the pre-existing Apache Arrow Plasma object store
framework to distributed systems by enabling clients to easily and efficiently
produce and consume data objects across multiple compute nodes. This allows big
data applications to increasingly leverage parallel processing at reduced
development costs. In addition, the paper includes latency and throughput
measurements that indicate only a modest performance penalty is incurred for
remote disaggregated memory access as opposed to local (~6.5 vs ~5.75 GiB/s).
The results can be used to guide the design of future systems that leverage
memory disaggregation as well as the newly presented framework. This work is

and organize the workflows around them. Issues are often inter-connected via
different links such as the default JIRA link types Duplicate, Relate, Block,

predicting duplication links, this work aims at understanding the various other
link types, their prevalence, and characteristics towards a more reliable link
type prediction. For this, we studied 607,208 links connecting 698,790 issues
in 15 public JIRA repositories. Besides the default types, the custom types
Depend, Incorporate, Split, and Cause were also common. We manually grouped all
75 link types used in the repositories into five general categories: General
Relation, Duplication, Composition, Temporal / Causal, and Workflow. Comparing
the structures of the corresponding graphs, we observed several trends. For
instance, Duplication links tend to represent simpler issue graphs often with
two components and Composition links present the highest amount of hierarchical
tree structures (97.7%). Surprisingly, General Relation links have a
significantly higher transitivity score than Duplication and Temporal / Causal
links. Motivated by the differences between the link types and by their
popularity, we evaluated the robustness of two state-of-the-art duplicate
detection approaches from the literature on the JIRA dataset. We found that
current deep-learning approaches confuse between Duplication and other links in
almost all repositories. On average, the classification accuracy dropped by 6%
for one approach and 12% for the other. Extending the training sets with other
link types seems to partly solve this issue. We discuss our findings and their

entity-based interaction (an action + its target entity) and the resulting

Explorer as entity-based interaction and enabled users to input notes and refer

users freely exploring the visualization and characterized their externalized
insights about the data. Using entity-based interactions and references to
infer insight characteristics (category, overview versus detail, and prior
knowledge), we found evidence that compared with interactions, entity
references improved insight characterization from slight/fair to fair/moderate

correlation analysis indicated that, e.g., detailed insights tended to have

production at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV is dominated by gluon-gluon fusion, providing
heightened sensitivity to gluon dynamics relative to other production channels.
Transverse single-spin asymmetries of positrons and electrons from heavy-flavor
hadron decays are measured at midrapidity using the PHENIX detector at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. These charge-separated measurements are
sensitive to gluon correlators that can in principle be related to gluon
orbital angular momentum via model calculations. Explicit constraints on gluon
correlators are extracted for two separate models, one of which had not been
constrained previously.

by a non-overlapping camera network. Existing methods often rely on purely
visual matching or consider temporal constraints but ignore the spatial
information of the camera network. To address this issue, we propose a
pedestrian retrieval framework based on cross-camera trajectory generation,
which integrates both temporal and spatial information. To obtain pedestrian
trajectories, we propose a novel cross-camera spatio-temporal model that
integrates pedestrians' walking habits and the path layout between cameras to
form a joint probability distribution. Such a spatio-temporal model among a
camera network can be specified using sparsely sampled pedestrian data. Based
on the spatio-temporal model, cross-camera trajectories can be extracted by the
conditional random field model and further optimized by restricted non-negative
matrix factorization. Finally, a trajectory re-ranking technique is proposed to
improve the pedestrian retrieval results. To verify the effectiveness of our
method, we construct the first cross-camera pedestrian trajectory dataset, the
Person Trajectory Dataset, in real surveillance scenarios. Extensive
experiments verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

One issue inherent to DP is that the ""privacy budget"" is generally ""spent""

with the real data, but can undervalue the conditional probabilities and
marginals that are critical for predictive quality of synthetic data. Further,
loss of predictive quality may be non-uniform across the data set, with subsets

  In this paper, we develop ensemble methods that distribute the privacy budget
""wisely"" to maximize predictive accuracy of models trained on DP data, and
""fairly"" to bound potential disparities in accuracy across groups and reduce
inequality. Our methods are based on the insights that feature importance can
inform how privacy budget is allocated, and, further, that per-group feature
importance and fairness-related performance objectives can be incorporated in
the allocation. These insights make our methods tunable to social contexts,

investigate hBN layers grown by Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) using
Fourier-transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in the temperature range of
160-540 K. Our measurements reveal strong differences in the character of
layer-substrate interaction for as-grown and delaminated epitaxial layers. A
much weaker interaction of as-grown layers is explained by wrinkles formation
that reduces strain at the layer-substrate interface, which for layers
transferred to other substrates occurs only in a limited temperature range. The
most striking result is the observation of a giant increase in the $E_{1u}$
phonon energy of up to $\sim6$ cm$^{-1}$ in a narrow temperature range. We show
that the amplitude and temperature range of the anomaly is strongly modified by
UV light illumination. The observed giant effect is explained in terms of
strain generation resulting from charge redistribution between shallow traps
and different defects, which can be interpreted as a result of strong
electron-phonon coupling in hBN. The observed narrow temperature range of the
anomaly indicates that the effect may be further enhanced for example by
electrostrictive effects, expected for sp$^2$ boron nitride.

environments. Our ASV is equipped with a broadband marine radar, an Inertial
Navigation System (INS), and uses official Electronic Navigational Charts

of well-defined steps, we can exclude land objects from the radar data, extract
tracks associated with moving vessels within range of the radar, and then use a
Kalman Filter to track and predict the motion of other moving vessels in the
vicinity. A Constant Velocity model for the Kalman Filter allows us to solve
the data association to build a consistent model between successive radar
scans. We account for multiple COLREGs situations based on the predicted
relative motion. Finally, an efficient path planning algorithm is presented to
find a path and publish waypoints to perform real-time COLREGs compliant
autonomous navigation within highly constrained environments. We demonstrate
the results of our framework with operational results collected over the course

new flexible-body immersed Lagrangian-Eulerian (ILE) approach incorporates the
geometrical and domain solution flexibility of the immersed boundary (IB)
method with an accuracy comparable to body-fitted approaches that sharply
resolve flows and stresses up to the fluid-structure interface. Unlike many IB
methods, our ILE formulation uses distinct momentum equations for the fluid and
solid subregions with a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling strategy that connects fluid
and solid subproblems through simple interface conditions. We use a penalty
method involving two representations of the fluid-structure interface. These
two representations are connected by approximate Lagrange multiplier forces
that impose kinematic interface conditions. This approach also enables the use
of multi-rate time stepping, which allows us to take different time step sizes
for the fluid and structure subproblems. Our fluid solver relies on an immersed
interface method for discrete surfaces to impose stress jump conditions along
complex interfaces. The dynamics of the volumetric structural mesh are
determined using a standard finite element approach to large-deformation
nonlinear elasticity via a nearly incompressible solid mechanics formulation.
This formulation also readily accommodates compressible structures for cases in
which part of the solid boundary does not contact the incompressible fluid.
Comparisons are made with computational and experimental benchmarks. We also
demonstrate the capabilities of this methodology by applying it to model the
transport and capture of a cylindrical blood clot in an inferior vena cava
filter.

indicate that training with a small subset and iterating on that to build a
larger set of labeled data allows us to converge to a fully annotated dataset
with a small number of iterations. Even in the case of a dataset labeled by
experts, a single iteration of the methodology improves the labels by
discovering additional complicated examples of labels associated with fish that
overlap, are very small, or obscured by the contrast limitations associated
with underwater imagery.

Besides, AdaCoach uses an automated dialogue evaluation model to score the
performance of the customer agent in the training process, which can provide
necessary assistance when the newly hired customer service agent encounters
problems. We apply recent NLP technologies to ensure efficient run-time

equation for massive fermions proposed in \cite{Weickgenannt:2021cuo} with the

got with a mutilated operator. With the assumption of total angular momentum
conservation, the collision term is proved to well describe the equilibrium
state and gives proper interpretation for collisional invariants, thus is
relevant for the research on local spin polarization. Following the familiar
fashion as used in quantum mechanics, we treat the problem of solving normal
modes as a degenerate perturbation problem and calculate the dispersion
relations for intriguing eleven zero modes, which form one-to-one
correspondence to all collisional invariants. We find that the results of
spinless modes appearing in ordinary hydrodynamics are consistent with
available conclusions in textbooks. As for spin-related modes, we obtain the
frequencies up to second order in wave vector and relate them with the
dissipation of spin density fluctuation. In addition, the ratio of two
relaxation time scales for spin and momentum is shown as a function of reduced
mass, which reads that based on present framework spin equilibration is almost
as slow as momentum equilibration as far as the strange quark spins in quark

the total mass of the bosonic star. In these configurations, the absence of the
photon sphere (the locus of unstable bound geodesics) makes the optical
appearance of these stars to be dominated by a single luminous ring enclosing a
central brightness depression, and no further light rings are available. We
show that if one considers face-on observations and a disk model whose emission
is truncated at some finite radius at which the luminosity attains its maximum

of the type and parameters of the bosonic stars in our samples having a
sub-dominant influence. These differences are nonetheless significantly
magnified when one allows the accretion disk to extend close enough to the

a regression network on architecture-latency pairs in conjunction with a
hardware-runtime descriptor to effectively estimate latency on a diverse pool

target device platform using a much smaller set of CPU performance counters
that are widely available on all Linux kernels, while still achieving up to
+49.6% accuracy gains against previous state-of-the-art baseline methods on
optimized edge device runtimes, using just 10 measurements from an unseen

trained on a pool of devices sharing a common runtime, MAPLE-Edge can
effectively generalize across runtimes by applying a trick of normalizing
performance counters by the operator latency, in the measured hardware-runtime

decades. These types of objects are extremely valuable systems for astronomical
studies as they exhibit both eclipsing and pulsation variations. The eclipsing
binaries are the only way to directly measure the mass and radius of stars with
a good accuracy ($\leq$1\%), while the pulsations are a unique way to probe the
stellar interior via oscillation frequencies. There are different types of
pulsating stars existing in eclipsing binaries. One of them is the Delta Scuti
variables. Currently, the known number of Delta Scuti stars in eclipsing
binaries is around 90 according to the latest catalog of these variables. An
increasing number of these kinds of variables is important to understand the
stellar structure, evolution and the effect of binarity on the pulsations.
Therefore, in this study, we focus on discovering new eclipsing binaries with
Delta Scuti component(s). We searched for the northern TESS field with a visual
inspection by following some criteria such as light curve shape, the existence
of pulsation like variations in the out-of-eclipse light curve and the Teff
values of the targets. As a result of these criteria, we determined some
targets. The TESS light curves of the selected targets first were removed from
the binarity and frequency analysis was performed on the residuals. The
luminosity, absolute and bolometric magnitudes of the targets were calculated
as well. To find how much of these parameters represent the primary binary
component (more luminous) we also computed the flux density ratio of the
systems by utilizing the area of the eclipses. In addition, the positions of
the systems in the H-R diagram were examined considering the flux density
ratios. As a consequence of the investigation, we defined 38 candidates Delta

and frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment
problem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on
agroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We
formulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach
can be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we
extract the agricultural management practices of ""crop rotation"" and ""landscape
crop diversity"" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and
use double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net
Primary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to
2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while
landscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we
observe considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and
analyze it.

distance and back azimuth estimates when these can be reliably determined -
when both are available these are combined to provide a location. Currently,
MQS do not assign a back azimuth to the vast majority of marsquakes. In this
work we develop and apply a polarization analysis method to determine the back
azimuth of seismic events from the polarization of observed P and S-wave

calibrated using a set of well-located earthquakes that have been recorded in

to the conclusion that LaSb termination is realized in the cleaved crystals.

investigated extensively as an optimisation problem in the past, but most
studies do not include nonlinear constraints associated with unbalanced
alternating current (AC) power flow in distribution networks. Previous studies
that do consider AC power flow use either less complex balanced formulations
applicable to transmission networks, or iterative linearisations derived from
local power flow solutions and prior knowledge of the design. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a new algorithm for obtaining DES design
decisions subject to nonlinear power flow models. The use of regularised
complementarity reformulations for operational constraints that contain binary
variables is proposed. This allows the use of large-scale nonlinear solvers
that can find locally optimal solutions, eliminating the need for
linearisations and prior knowledge while improving accuracy. DES design models
with either multiphase optimal power flow (MOPF), which captures inherent phase
imbalances present in distribution networks, or balanced optimal power flow
formulations (OPF) are tested using a modified version of the unbalanced IEEE
EU low-voltage network. Results are compared with a popular linear DES design
framework, which proposes an infeasible operational schedule when tested with
MOPF, while the fixed design alone produces the highest annualised costs.
Despite the increased complexity, DES with MOPF obtains the best solution,
enabling a greater integration of solar capacity and reducing total annualised
cost when compared to DES with OPF. The new algorithm achieves a 19%
improvement when compared with solving a bi-level model for DES with OPF, where
the entire binary topology in the nonlinear model is fixed. The study therefore
enables the acquisition of DES designs that can work symbiotically within
distribution networks.

cyber-resilient power system. Recently, data-driven detectors and physics-based
Moving Target Defences (MTD) have been proposed to detect false data injection
(FDI) attacks on state estimation. However, the uncontrollable false positive
rate of the data-driven detector and the extra cost of frequent MTD usage limit
their wide applications. Few works have explored the overlap between these two
areas. To fill this gap, this paper proposes blending data-driven and
physics-based approaches to enhance the detection performance. To start, a
physics-informed data-driven attack detection and identification algorithm is
proposed. Then, an MTD protocol is triggered by the positive alarm from the
data-driven detector. The MTD is formulated as a bilevel optimisation to
robustly guarantee its effectiveness against the worst-case attack around the
identified attack vector. Meanwhile, MTD hiddenness is also improved so that
the defence cannot be detected by the attacker. To guarantee feasibility and
convergence, the convex two-stage reformulation is derived through duality and
linear matrix inequality. The simulation results verify that blending data and
physics can achieve extremely high detection rate while simultaneously reducing
the false positive rate of the data-driven detector and the extra cost of MTD.

lensed would bring together these two pillars of General Relativity for the
first time. This breakthrough is challenging for many reasons, including: GW
sky localization uncertainties dwarf the angular scale of gravitational
lensing, the mass and structure of gravitational lenses is diverse, the mass
function of stellar remnant compact objects is not yet well constrained, and GW
detectors do not operate continuously. We introduce a new approach that is
agnostic to the mass and structure of the lenses, compare the efficiency of
different methods for lensed GW discovery, and explore detection of lensed
kilonova counterparts as a direct method for localising candidates. Our main
conclusions are: (1) lensed neutron star mergers (NS-NS) are magnified into the
""mass gap"" between NS and black holes, therefore selecting candidates from
public GW alerts with high mass gap probability is efficient, (2) the rate of
detectable lensed NS-NS will approach one per year in the mid-2020s, (3) the
arrival time difference between lensed NS-NS images is $1\,\rm
sec\lesssim\Delta t\lesssim1\,year$, and thus well-matched to the operations of
GW detectors and optical telescopes, (4) lensed kilonova counterparts are faint
at peak (e.g.\ $r_{\rm AB}\simeq24-26$ in the mid-2020s), fade quickly
($d<2\,\rm days$), and are detectable with target of opportunity observations
with large wide-field telescopes. For example, just $\lesssim0.25$ per cent of
Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory's observing time will be sufficient to follow up one
well-localized candidate per year. Our predictions also provide a physically
well-defined basis for exploring electromagnetically the exciting new ""mass

the arrival of GWs, and alters their amplitude -- thus biasing the inferred
progenitor masses. This would provide a physically well-understood
interpretation of GW detections in the ''mass gap'' between neutron stars and
black holes, as gravitationally lensed binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We
selected three GW detections in LIGO-Virgo's third run for which the
probability of at least one of the constituent compact objects being in the
mass gap was reported as high with low latency -- i.e. candidate lensed BNS
mergers. Our observations of powerful strong lensing clusters located adjacent
to the peak of their sky localisation error maps reached a sensitivity $\rm
AB\simeq25.5$ in the $z'$-band with the GMOS instruments on the Gemini
telescopes, and detected no candidate lensed optical counterparts. We combine
recent kilonova lightcurve models with recent predictions of the lensed BNS
population and the properties of the objects that we followed up to show that
realistic optical counterparts were detectable in our observations. Further
detailed analysis of two of the candidates suggests that they are a plausible
pair of images of the same low-mass binary black hole merger, lensed by a local
galaxy or small group of galaxies. This further underlines that access to
accurate mass information with low latency would improve the efficiency of
candidate lensed BNS selection.

large rotations in the magnetic field direction. Observations from Parker Solar
Probe's (PSP's) first two solar encounters have formed the basis for many of
the described switchback properties and generation mechanisms. However, this
early data may not be representative of the typical near-Sun solar wind,
biasing our current understanding of these phenomena. One defining switchback
property is the magnetic deflection direction. During the first solar
encounter, this was primarily in the tangential direction for the longest
switchbacks, which has since been discussed as evidence, and a testable
prediction, of several switchback generation methods. In this study, we
re-examine the deflection direction of switchbacks during the first eight PSP
encounters to confirm the existence of a systematic deflection direction. We
first identify switchbacks exceeding a threshold deflection in the magnetic
field and confirm a previous finding that they are arc-polarized. In agreement
with earlier results from PSP's first encounter, we find that groups of longer
switchbacks tend to deflect in the same direction for several hours. However,
in contrast to earlier studies, we find that there is no unique direction for
these deflections, although several solar encounters showed a non-uniform
distribution in deflection direction with a slight preference for the
tangential direction. This result suggests a systematic magnetic configuration
for switchback generation, which is consistent with interchange reconnection as
a source mechanism, although this new evidence does not rule out other
mechanisms, such as the expansion of wave modes.

contradiction. We explore emergent language properties by varying agent
population size in the speaker-listener Lewis Game. After reproducing the
experimental difference, we challenge the simulation assumption that the agent
community is homogeneous. We first investigate how speaker-listener asymmetry
alters language structure to examine two potential diversity factors: training
speed and network capacity. We find out that emergent language properties are
only altered by the relative difference of learning speeds between speaker and
listener, and not by their absolute values. From then, we leverage this
observation to control population heterogeneity without introducing confounding
factors. We finally show that introducing such training speed heterogeneities
naturally sort out the initial contradiction: larger simulated communities
start developing more stable and structured languages.

infrared surveys such as VHS and UHS, and all-sky \textit{WISE} data. In

by visual inspection, deriving estimates of the false positive rate that are as
low as 6 per cent. The method is also tested on simulated Rubin data from their
DP0 programme, which yields complementary results of a good recovery rate of
$\gtrsim 80$ per cent for $M_{200}\geq7\times10^{13}$M$_\odot$ clusters and
with no false positives produced in our test region. Importantly, our method is
positioned to create a watchlist in advance of Rubin's LSST, as it utilises
only existing data, therefore enabling the discovery of lensed transients early

estimator of maximizing received power (Max-RP) is proposed to find the maximum
value of $K$-subarray output powers, where each subarray is in charge of one
sector, and the center angle of the sector corresponding to the maximum output
is the estimated true DOA. To make an enhancement on precision, Max-RP plus
quadratic interpolation (Max-RP-QI) method is designed. In the proposed
Max-RP-QI, a quadratic interpolation scheme is adopted to interpolate the three
DOA values corresponding to the largest three receive powers of Max-RP.
Finally, to achieve the CRLB, a Root-MUSIC plus Max-RP-QI scheme is developed.
Simulation results show that the proposed three methods eliminate the phase

particular, the proposed Root-MUSIC plus Max-RP-QI scheme can reach the CRLB,

active matter, together with an analytical description of the instability
threshold in terms of activity and elasticity of the cells. Furthermore, we
provide a quantitative characterisation and comparison of flows and topological

the 3D atmospheres to generate high-resolution emission spectra for two

result of the 3D structure of the planet. At phases exhibiting both emission
and absorption features, the Doppler shift differs in direction between the two
spectral features, making them differentiable instead of canceling each other
out. Through the use of cross-correlation, we find different patterns in net
Doppler shift for models with different treatments of drag: the nightside
spectra show opposite signs in their Doppler shift, while the dayside phases
have a reversal in the trend of net shift with phase. Finally, we caution
researchers from using a single spectral template throughout the planet's

pick up on a bright region on the edge of the planet disk that is highly red-

interest due to its relevance in real-world applications, from intelligent
access in private media galleries to web-scale video search. Learning the
cross-similarity of video and text in a joint embedding space is the dominant
approach. To do so, a contrastive loss is usually employed because it organizes
the embedding space by putting similar items close and dissimilar items far.
This framework leads to competitive recall rates, as they solely focus on the
rank of the groundtruth items. Yet, assessing the quality of the ranking list
is of utmost importance when considering intelligent retrieval systems, since
multiple items may share similar semantics, hence a high relevance. Moreover,
the aforementioned framework uses a fixed margin to separate similar and
dissimilar items, treating all non-groundtruth items as equally irrelevant. In
this paper we propose to use a variable margin: we argue that varying the
margin used during training based on how much relevant an item is to a given
query, i.e. a relevance-based margin, easily improves the quality of the
ranking lists measured through nDCG and mAP. We demonstrate the advantages of
our technique using different models on EPIC-Kitchens-100 and YouCook2. We show
that even if we carefully tuned the fixed margin, our technique (which does not
have the margin as a hyper-parameter) would still achieve better performance.
Finally, extensive ablation studies and qualitative analysis support the
robustness of our approach. Code will be released at

Despite the necessity of countering adversarial patch attacks, very few efforts
have been dedicated to defending person detection against adversarial patch
attack. In this paper, we propose a novel defense strategy that defends against
an adversarial patch attack by optimizing a defensive frame for person
detection. The defensive frame alleviates the effect of the adversarial patch
while maintaining person detection performance with clean person. The proposed
defensive frame in the person detection is generated with a competitive
learning algorithm which makes an iterative competition between detection
threatening module and detection shielding module in person detection.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively defends person detection against adversarial patch attacks.

the effect of the finite nuclear magnetization distribution in the

\mu(^{187}{\rm Re})=3.1891(3)(12) \mu_N$, where the first uncertainty is the

admissions, and the assignment of public housing, the decision of who receives
an allocation can be justified by various normative criteria. Such settings
have motivated the following priority-respecting allocation problem: several
categories, each with a quota of interchangeable items, wish to allocate the
items among a set of agents. Each category has a list of eligible agents and a
priority ordering over these agents; agents may be eligible in multiple
categories. The goal is to select a valid allocation: one that respects quotas,
eligibility, and priorities and ensures Pareto efficiency. We provide an
algorithmic characterization of all valid allocations, exhibiting a bijection
between sets of agents who can be allocated and maximum-weight matchings under
carefully chosen rank-based weights. While prior work provides a
polynomial-time algorithm to locate a valid allocation, our characterization
admits a simpler algorithm that enables two wide-reaching extensions: 1.
Selecting valid allocations that satisfy additional criteria: Via three
examples -- inclusion/exclusion of some chosen agent; agent-side Pareto
efficiency vs. welfare maximization; and fairness from the perspective of
allocated vs. unallocated agents -- we show that finding priority-respecting
allocations subject to some secondary constraint straddles a complexity
knife-edge; in each example, one problem variant can be solved efficiently,
while its variant is NP-hard. 2. Efficiency-envy tradeoffs in dynamic
allocation: In settings where allocations must be made to T agents arriving
sequentially via some stochastic process, we show that while insisting on zero
priority violations leads to an Omega(T) loss in efficiency, one can design
allocation policies ensuring that the sum of the efficiency loss and priority
violations in hindsight is O(1).

pseudosymmetries and varying amounts of noise serve as examples. Contrary to
traditional crystallographic symmetry classifications with an image processing
program such as CRISP, the classification process does not need to be
supervised by a human being and is free of any subjectively set thresholds in
the geometric model selection process. This enables crystallographic symmetry
classification of digital images that are more or less periodic in two
dimensions (2D), a.k.a. crystal patterns, as recorded with sufficient
structural resolution from a wide range of crystalline samples with different
types of scanning probe and transmission electron microscopes. Correct symmetry
classifications enable the optimal crystallographic processing of such images.
That processing consists in the averaging over all asymmetric units in all unit
cells in the selected image area and significantly enhances both the signal to
noise ratio and the structural resolution of a microscopic study of a crystal.
For sufficiently complex crystal patterns, the information-theoretic symmetry
classification methods are more accurate than both visual classifications by
human experts and the recommendations of one of the popular crystallographic
image processing programs of electron crystallography.

aims to investigate the feasibility of continual learning for multicenter
collaboration on an exemplary application of brain metastasis identification
using DeepMedic. 920 T1 MRI contrast enhanced volumes are split to simulate
multicenter collaboration scenarios. A continual learning algorithm, synaptic
intelligence (SI), is applied to preserve important model weights for training
one center after another. In a bilateral collaboration scenario, continual
learning with SI achieves a sensitivity of 0.917, and naive continual learning
without SI achieves a sensitivity of 0.906, while two models trained on
internal data solely without continual learning achieve sensitivity of 0.853
and 0.831 only. In a seven-center multilateral collaboration scenario, the
models trained on internal datasets (100 volumes each center) without continual
learning obtain a mean sensitivity value of 0.699. With single-visit continual
learning (i.e., the shared model visits each center only once during training),
the sensitivity is improved to 0.788 and 0.849 without SI and with SI,
respectively. With iterative continual learning (i.e., the shared model
revisits each center multiple times during training), the sensitivity is
further improved to 0.914, which is identical to the sensitivity using mixed
data for training. Our experiments demonstrate that continual learning can
improve brain metastasis identification performance for centers with limited

for peer-to-peer federated learning in multicenter collaboration.

image and video signal processing. But, due to the widespread use of low-power
and mobile devices, the computational complexity of an algorithm plays a
crucial role in selecting an algorithm for a given problem. Within the scope of
this contribution, we introduce the complex-valued Frequency Selective
Extrapolation for fast image and video signal extrapolation. This algorithm
iteratively generates a generic complex-valued model of the signal to be
extrapolated as weighted superposition of Fourier basis functions. We further
show that this algorithm is up to 10 times faster than the existent real-valued
Frequency Selective Extrapolation that takes the real-valued nature of the
input signals into account during the model generation. At the same time, the
quality which is achievable by the complex-valued model generation is similar
to the quality of the real-valued model generation.

extending known signals into unknown areas. The Selective Extrapolation is a
very effective algorithm to achieve this. Thereby, the extrapolation is
obtained by generating a model of the signal to be extrapolated as weighted
superposition of basis functions. Unfortunately, this algorithm is
computationally very expensive and, up to now, efficient implementations exist
only for basis function sets that emanate from discrete transforms. Within the
scope of this contribution, a novel efficient solution for Selective
Extrapolation is presented for utilization with arbitrary basis functions. The
proposed algorithm mathematically behaves identically to the original Selective
Extrapolation, but is several decades faster. Furthermore, it is able to
outperform existent fast transform domain algorithms which are limited to basis
function sets that belong to the corresponding transform. With that, the novel
algorithm allows for an efficient use of arbitrary basis functions, even if

buy goods that maximize their utilities while a central planner sets prices on
capacity-constrained goods such that the market clears. However, the efficacy
of pricing schemes in achieving an equilibrium outcome in Fisher markets
typically relies on complete knowledge of users' budgets and utilities and
requires that transactions happen in a static market wherein all users are
present simultaneously.
  As a result, we study an online variant of Fisher markets, wherein
budget-constrained users with privately known utility and budget parameters,
drawn i.i.d. from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$, enter the market sequentially.
In this setting, we develop an algorithm that adjusts prices solely based on
observations of user consumption, i.e., revealed preference feedback, and
achieves a regret and capacity violation of $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the
number of users and the good capacities scale as $O(n)$. Here, our regret
measure is the optimality gap in the objective of the Eisenberg-Gale program
between an online algorithm and an offline oracle with complete information on
users' budgets and utilities. To establish the efficacy of our approach, we
show that any uniform (static) pricing algorithm, including one that sets
expected equilibrium prices with complete knowledge of the distribution
$\mathcal{D}$, cannot achieve both a regret and constraint violation of less
than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. While our revealed preference algorithm requires no
knowledge of the distribution $\mathcal{D}$, we show that if $\mathcal{D}$ is
known, then an adaptive variant of expected equilibrium pricing achieves
$O(\log(n))$ regret and constant capacity violation for discrete distributions.
Finally, we present numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of our
revealed preference algorithm relative to several benchmarks.

conductance states, which can be quantized, originate from the formation of a

is the strong variability of the voltage required to switch the device to its

distinct regimes: regime I for flow angles smaller than the critical angle
$\theta_c\approx 40^\circ$ and regime II at flow angles larger than $\theta_c$

exhibit a strong variation of the volume fraction through the depth. Three
relevant lengths are identified in the system: $W$ the gap between sidewalls,
$l$ the length characterizing the vertical variation of the volume fraction and
$h$ a characteristic length associated with the vertical variation of the
streamwise velocity. Using these lengths we can rescale the profiles of various
flow properties (e.g. streamwise velocity, granular temperature, particle
rotation...). In regime II, in contrast to regime I, $l$ and $h$ have a similar
behaviour. As a consequence, the rescaled profiles in regime II only involve
$h$ (or equivalently $l$) and $W$ . Other dissimilarities exist between regimes
I and II. In particular, the scaling of the flow rate with $h$ (at fixed $W$ )
differs in the two regimes, although they display a similar scaling with $W$

RigoBERTa is trained over a well-curated corpus formed up from different
subcorpora with key features. It follows the DeBERTa architecture, which has
several advantages over other architectures of similar size as BERT or RoBERTa.
RigoBERTa performance is assessed over 13 NLU tasks in comparison with other
available Spanish language models, namely, MarIA, BERTIN and BETO. RigoBERTa
outperformed the three models in 10 out of the 13 tasks, achieving new
""State-of-the-Art"" results.

  Hines","OHM: GPU Based Occupancy Map Generation","Under review",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Occupancy grid maps (OGMs) are fundamental to most systems for autonomous
robotic navigation. However, CPU-based implementations struggle to keep up with
data rates from modern 3D lidar sensors, and provide little capacity for modern
extensions which maintain richer voxel representations. This paper presents
OHM, our open source, GPU-based OGM framework. We show how the algorithms can
be mapped to GPU resources, resolving difficulties with contention to obtain a
successful implementation. The implementation supports many modern OGM
algorithms including NDT-OM, NDT-TM, decay-rate and TSDF. A thorough
performance evaluation is presented based on tracked and quadruped UGV
platforms and UAVs, and data sets from both outdoor and subterranean
environments. The results demonstrate excellent performance improvements both
offline, and for online processing in embedded platforms. Finally, we describe
how OHM was a key enabler for the UGV navigation solution for our entry in the
DARPA Subterranean Challenge, which placed second at the Final Event.

interconnection networks to another. The quadtree is an important technique
used to present spatial data and is used in many application domains,
especially computer vision and image processing. Researchers are interested in
the construction and manipulation of quadtrees on parallel machines. The
crossed cubes consider an alternative to the ordinary hypercube. It offers many
attractive properties. Significantly, it reduces diameter by a factor of 2 that
of the ordinary cubes. Moreover, the crossed cubes have a great capacity to
simulate other architectures. This paper is interested in the one-by-one
dilation two embedding of a particular sub-quadtree graph into m-dimensional
crossed cubes.
