attention for their wide spectrum of optical and electric properties, being
promising candidates for optoelectronic and novel electrical applications,
however in their pristine form they are very sensitive and vulnerable to oxygen
in air. Here we present two newly designed vdW heterostructures based on hBN
(hexagonal boron nitride) and GaTe or InTe monolayer. Using density functional
theory we investigate electronic and optical properties of those structures.
Their moderate band gap and an good absorption coefficient makes them excellent
for absorbers in wide spectrum, covering all from part of IR to far UV
spectrum, with particularly good absorption of UV light. The hBN layer which
can be beneficial for protection of sensitive GaTe and InTe does not only
preserve their optical properties but also enhances it. Moreover, we confirm
that type of stacking does not affect any relevant properties, as all three
stacking types are very similar in total energy and bandstructure is almost the
same for every one. This is especially important for easier experimental
realization.

steep barriers. Charge oscillations in these domains give rise to a net
hole-hole attraction proportional to the height of these barriers.
Concomitantly, the self-consistent calculations yield localized superconducting

field-effect transistors (SiFETs and GFETs), it was demonstrated that the
combination of both materials within the hybrid channel contribute uniquely to
the charge carrier transport. A comprehensive physics-based compact modeling
was specifically developed, showing excellent agreement with the experimental

theoretical results from the electrostatics and the carrier transport under a
drift-diffusion approach show that graphene acts as a shield for the silicon
channel, giving rise to a non-uniform potential distribution along it,
especially at the subthreshold region. This graphene screening effect is shown
to strongly affect the device subthreshold swing when compared against a
conventional SiFET due to a non-negligible diffusion current in this operation
regime.

(FeTA) Challenge in 2021 in order to encourage the development of automatic
segmentation algorithms on an international level. The challenge utilized FeTA
Dataset, an open dataset of fetal brain MRI reconstructions segmented into
seven different tissues (external cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, white
matter, ventricles, cerebellum, brainstem, deep grey matter). 20 international
teams participated in this challenge, submitting a total of 21 algorithms for
evaluation. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the results from
both a technical and clinical perspective. All participants relied on deep
learning methods, mainly U-Nets, with some variability present in the network
architecture, optimization, and image pre- and post-processing. The majority of
teams used existing medical imaging deep learning frameworks. The main
differences between the submissions were the fine tuning done during training,
and the specific pre- and post-processing steps performed. The challenge
results showed that almost all submissions performed similarly. Four of the top
five teams used ensemble learning methods. However, one team's algorithm
performed significantly superior to the other submissions, and consisted of an
asymmetrical U-Net network architecture. This paper provides a first of its

We perform this analysis on a sample of 133 disk-dominated galaxies from the

Survey and Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel
samples. We find that both the hybrid SFR estimators and the $A_{\rm

this dependence in the hybrid SFR estimators, we derive an inclination and a
far-UV and near-IR color-dependent parametric relation for converting observed
UV and IR luminosities into SFRs. For the $A_{\rm FUV}$-$\beta$ relation, we
introduce an inclination-dependent component that accounts for the majority of
the inclination dependence with the scatter of the relation increasing with
inclination. We then compare both of these inclination-dependent relations to
similar inclination-independent relations found in the literature. From this
comparison, we find that the UV+IR correction factor and $A_{\rm FUV}$ for our
hybrid and $A_{\rm FUV}$-$\beta$ relations, respectively, result in a reduction
in the residual scatter of our sample by approximately a factor of 2.
Therefore, we demonstrate that inclination must be considered in hybrid SFR
estimators and the $A_{\rm FUV}$-$\beta$ relation to produce more accurate SFR
estimates in disk-dominated galaxies.

distributionally robust optimization (Sagawa et al., 2020a, GDRO) is a standard
baseline for learning models with strong worst-group performance. However, GDRO
requires group labels for every example during training and can be prone to
overfitting, often requiring careful model capacity control via regularization
or early stopping. When only a limited amount of group labels is available,
Just Train Twice (Liu et al., 2021, JTT) is a popular approach which infers a

classifier retraining on independent splits (of the training data). We find
that using a novel sample splitting procedure achieves robust worst-group

$\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$. This problem was studied by Esposito et al [13,14]
where they showed that the solution tends to a local Maxwellian with parameters
satisfying the compressible Navier-Stokes equation with no-slip boundary
condition. However, a lot of numerical experiments reveal that the fluid layer
does not entirely stick to the boundary. In the regime where the Knudsen number
is reasonably small, the slip phenomenon is significant near the boundary.
Thus, we revisit this problem by taking into account the slip boundary
conditions. Following the lines of [9], we will first give a formal asymptotic
analysis to see that the flow governed by the Boltzmann equation is accurately
approximated by a superposition of a steady CNS equation with a temperature
jump condition and two Knudsen layers located at end points. Then we will
establish a uniform $L^\infty$ estimate on the remainder and derive the slip
boundary condition for compressible Navier-Stokes equations rigorously.

the resulting local reduced order bases (ROBs) and parametric reduced order

Performances achieved by state-of-the-art DRL algorithms are compared through a

experimental plan is designed and performed, including different structures,
topologies, demands, capacities, and costs of the supply chain. Results show
that the PPO algorithm adapts very well to different characteristics of the

fastest algorithm, but just like VPG, it never achieves the best performance

structural theory of chemistry however, in contrast to the free atoms a
comprehensive quantum mechanical theory of AIM has never been proposed.
Currently the most satisfactory deduction of this concept is based on the
partitioning methodologies that are trying to recover AIM from the ab initio
wavefunctions (WF). One of these methodologies is the quantum theory of AIM
(QTAIM), which retrieves AIM by an exhaustive partitioning of the one-electron
density into atomic basins in real space. The molecular properties are then
partitioned into the basin and inter-basin contributions as the incarnation of
the AIM properties and their interaction modes. The inputs of the QTAIM
partitioning scheme are the electronic WF computed from the electronic
Schrodinger equation (SE), which is basically a single-component equation
treating electrons as quantum particles and the nuclei as clamped point charges
(CPC). A recently extended form of the QTAIM, called the multi-component QTAIM
(MC-QTAIM), removes this restriction and enables AIM partitioning to be applied
to the MC quantum systems. This is done using MC-WF as inputs that are derived
from the MC-SE in which there are two or more types of quantum particles. This
opens the possibility for the AIM partitioning of molecular systems where
certain nuclei, e.g. because of their non-adiabatic coupling to electrons, must
be treated as quantum particles instead of CPC. The same formalism allows the
partitioning of exotic molecular systems in which there are other elementary
particles like muons or positrons, in addition to electrons and nuclei. The
application of the MC-QTAIM partitioning to such systems reveals that the
positively charged muon may shape its own atomic basin, i.e. an example of
exotic AIM, while positron may act as an agent of bonding, i.e. an example of
exotic bonds.

transfer in micro- and mini-channels with arrays of offset strip fins, subject
to a constant heat flux. The Nusselt number is defined on the basis of a heat
transfer coefficient which represents the spatially constant macro-scale
temperature difference between the fluid and solid during conjugate heat
transfer. Its values are determined numerically on a single unit cell of the
array for Reynolds numbers between 1 and 600. Two combinations of the Prandtl
number and the thermal conductivity ratio are selected, corresponding to air
and water. It is shown that the Nusselt number correlations from the literature
mainly apply to air in the transitional flow regime in larger conventional
channels if the wall temperature remains uniform. As a result, they do not
correctly capture the observed trends for the Nusselt number in micro- and
mini-channels subject to a constant heat flux. Therefore, new Nusselt number
correlations, obtained through a least-squares fitting of 2282 numerical
simulations, are presented for air and water. The suitability of these
correlations is assessed via the Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and
model validation. The correlations respect the observed asymptotic trends and
limits of the Nusselt number for all the geometrical parameters of the offset
strip fins. In addition, they predict a linear dependence of the Nusselt number
on the Reynolds number, in good agreement with the data from this work.
Nevertheless, a detailed analysis reveals a more complex scaling of the Nusselt
number with the Reynolds number, closely related to the underlying flow
regimes, particularly the weak and strong inertia regimes. Finally, through 62
additional simulations, the influence of the material properties on the Nusselt
number is illustrated and compared to the available literature.

disk, the dense gas mass fraction varies along spiral arms but the average
value over all spiral arms is comparable to the mean value of interarm regions.
We suggest that the near constant dense gas mass fraction throughout the disk
arises from a population of density stratified, self gravitating molecular
clouds and the required density threshold to detect each spectral line. The
measured dense gas fraction significantly increases in the central bulge in
response to the effective pressure, P_e, from the weight from the stellar and
gas components. This pressure modifies the dynamical state of the molecular
cloud population and possibly, the HCN emitting regions, in the central bulge
from self-gravitating to diffuse configurations in which P_e is greater than
the gravitational energy density of individual clouds. Diffuse molecular clouds
comprise a significant fraction of the molecular gas mass in the central bulge,
which may account for the measured sublinear relationships between the surface
densities of the star formation rate and molecular and dense gas.

input delay systems subject to dissipative constraints while all the effect of
input delay is compensated by a controller with novel structure. The method is
inspired by the recent development in the mathematical treatment of distributed
delays and predictor controllers, which are critical for the derivation of the
solution. An important conceptual innovation is the use of a parameterized
dynamical state feedback controller (DSFC), where the dimension of the
controller equals the dimension of the control input. A sufficient condition
for the existence of a dissipative DSFC is obtained via the Krasovskii
functional approach, where the condition includes a bilinear matrix inequality
(BMI). To solve the BMI, we apply an inner convex approximation algorithm which
can be initialized based on an explicit construction of a predictor controller
gain. The proposed DSFC can be considered as an extension of the classical
predictor controller, thereby capable of compensating all the effects of the
pointwise input delay while satisfying dissipative constraints. A numerical
example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

autonomous navigation. The diversity of data in different domains imposes
significant gaps to the prediction performance of the perception model. In this
work, we make efforts to reduce the gaps by proposing a novel coarse-to-fine
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) model - CALI. Our aim is to transfer the
perception model with high data efficiency, eliminate the prohibitively
expensive data labeling, and improve the generalization capability during the
adaptation from easy-to-obtain source domains to various challenging target
domains. We prove that a combination of a coarse alignment and a fine alignment
can be beneficial to each other and further design a first-coarse-then-fine
alignment process. This proposed work bridges theoretical analyses and
algorithm designs, leading to an efficient UDA model with easy and stable
training. We show the advantages of our proposed model over multiple baselines
in several challenging domain adaptation setups. To further validate the
effectiveness of our model, we then combine our perception model with a visual
planner to build a navigation system and show the high reliability of our model
in complex natural environments where no labeled data is available.

R^d, d>2 with N cylindrical outlets to infinity with bounded inclusions in
R^{d-1}. Cauchy data are prescribed on the boundary of the bounded domains and
the aim is to find solution on the unbounded part of the boundary. In 1989,
Kozlov and Maz'ya proposed an alternating iterative method for solving Cauchy
problems associated with elliptic,self-adjoint and positive-definite operators
in bounded domains. Different variants of this method for solving Cauchy
problems associated with Helmholtz-type operators exists. We consider the
variant proposed by Mpinganzima et al. for bounded domains and derive the
necessary conditions for the convergence of the procedure in unbounded domains.
For the numerical implementation, a finite difference method is used to solve
the problem in a simple rectangular domain in R^2 that represent a truncated
infinite strip. The numerical results shows that by appropriate truncation of
the domain and with appropriate choice of the Robin parameters, the
Robin-Dirichlet alternating iterative procedure is convergent.

is strongly renormalized by electron-electron interactions, and thus, the
associated topological properties of the bands are sensitive to filling. Using
a Hartree formalism, we calculate the linear and nonlinear Hall conductivities,
and find that for certain fillings, the remote bands contribute substantially
to the Hall currents while the contribution from the central bands is
suppressed. In particular, we find that these currents are generically
substantial near regions of energies where the bands are highly entangled with
each other, often featuring doping-induced band inversions. Our results
demonstrate that topological transport in TBG/hBN is substantially modified by
electron-electron interactions, which offer a simple explanation to recent

public health. With this in mind, policy-makers in cities worldwide seek to
improve the bicycle mode-share. However, they often struggle against the fear
and the perceived riskiness of cycling. Efforts to increase the bicycle's
mode-share involve many measures, one of them being the improvement of cycling
safety. This requires the analysis of the factors surrounding accidents and the
outcome. However, meaningful analysis of cycling safety requires accurate
bicycle flow data that is generally sparse or not even available at a segment
level. Therefore, safety engineers often rely on aggregated variables or
calibration factors that fail to account for variations in the cycling traffic
caused by external factors. This paper fills this gap by presenting a Deep
Learning based approach, the Long Short-Term Memory Mixture Density Network
(LSTMMDN), to estimate hourly bicycle flow in Copenhagen, conditional on
weather, temporal and road conditions at the segment level. This method
addresses the shortcomings in the calibration factor method and results in
66-77\% more accurate bicycle traffic estimates. To quantify the impact of more
accurate bicycle traffic estimates in cycling safety analysis, we estimate
bicycle crash risk models to evaluate bicycle crashes in Copenhagen. The models
are identical except for the exposure variables being used. One model is
estimated using the LSTMMDN estimates, one using the calibration-based
estimates, and one using yearly mean traffic estimates. The results show that
investing in more advanced methods for obtaining bicycle volume estimates can
benefit the quality, mitigating efforts by improving safety analyses and other
performance measures.

to leverage both human and computational abilities in decision making systems.
IML represents a collaboration between multiple complementary human and machine
intelligent systems working as a team, each with their own unique abilities and
limitations. This teamwork might mean that both systems take actions at the
same time, or in sequence. Two major open research questions in the field of
IML are: ""How should we design systems that can learn to make better decisions
over time with human interaction?"" and ""How should we evaluate the design and
deployment of such systems?"" A lack of appropriate consideration for the humans
involved can lead to problematic system behaviour, and issues of fairness,
accountability, and transparency. Thus, our goal with this work is to present a
human-centred guide to designing and evaluating IML systems while mitigating
risks. This guide is intended to be used by machine learning practitioners who
are responsible for the health, safety, and well-being of interacting humans.
An obligation of responsibility for public interaction means acting with
integrity, honesty, fairness, and abiding by applicable legal statutes. With
these values and principles in mind, we as a machine learning research
community can better achieve goals of augmenting human skills and abilities.
This practical guide therefore aims to support many of the responsible
decisions necessary throughout the iterative design, development, and
dissemination of IML systems.

not visible to users and customers but hinder developers in their work, making
future changes more difficult. TD is often incurred due to tight project
deadlines and can make future changes more costly or impossible. Project
Management usually focuses on customer benefits and pays less attention to
their IT systems' internal quality. TD prevention should be preferred over TD
repayment because subsequent refactoring and re-engineering are expensive.
Objective. This paper evaluates a framework focusing on both TD prevention and
TD repayment in the context of agile-managed projects. The framework was
developed and applied in an IT unit of a publishing house. The unique
contribution of this framework is the integration of TD management into project
management. Method. The evaluation was performed as a comparative case study
based on ticket statistics and two structured surveys. The surveys were
conducted in the observed IT unit using the framework and a comparison unit not
using the framework. The first survey targeted team members, the second one IT
managers. Results. The evaluation shows that in this IT unit, the TAP framework
led to a raised awareness for the incurrence of TD. Decisions to incur TD are
intentional, and TD is repaid timelier. Unintentional TD incurred by
unconscious decisions is prevented. Furthermore, better communication and
better planning of the project pipeline can be observed. Conclusions. We
provide an insight into practitioners' ways to identify, monitor, prevent and
repay TD. The presented framework includes a feasible method for TD prevention
despite tight timelines by making TD repayment part of project management.

  optomechanics","typos in .v2 corrected",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cavity optomechanics offers quantum cooling, quantum control and measurement
of small mechanical oscillators. However the optical backactions that underpin
quantum control can significantly disturb the oscillator modes: mechanical
frequencies are shifted by the optical spring effect and light-matter
hybridisation in strong coupling regimes; mechanical modes hybridise with each
other via the cavity mode. This is even more pertinent in the field of
levitated optomechanics, where optical trapping fully determines the mechanical
modes and their frequencies. Here, using the coherent-scattering (CS) set-up
that allowed quantum ground state cooling of a levitated nanoparticle, we show
that -- when trapping away from a node of the cavity standing wave -- the CS
field opposes optical spring shifts and mechanical mode hybridisation. At an
optimal cancellation point, independent of most experimental parameters, we
demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to strongly cavity cool and
control the {\em unperturbed} modes. Suppression of the cavity-induced mode
hybridisation in the $x-y$ plane is quantified by measuring the
$S_{xy}(\omega)$ correlation spectra which are seen to always be
anti-correlated except at the cancellation point where they become
uncorrelated. The findings have implications for directional force sensing
using CS set-ups.

(LMXBs) covers a broad energy band from radio to X-rays. Studying the
correlations between emission in different energy bands during outbursts can
provide valuable information about the accretion process. We analyse the
simultaneous optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray data of the BH-LMXB Swift
J1753.5-0127 during its $\sim$ 12-year long outburst with the {\it Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory}. We find that the UV/optical and X-ray emission are strongly
correlated during the hard states of the outburst. We fit the relation with a
power-law function $F_{UV/optical} \propto F_{X}^{\beta}$ and find that the
power-law index $\beta$ increases from $\sim$ 0.24 to $\sim$ 0.33 as the
UV/optical wavelength decreases from $\sim$ 5400 \r{A} (V) to $\sim$ 2030 \r{A}
(UVW2). We explore the possible reasons for this and suggest that in Swift
J1753.5-0127 the UV/optical emission is dominated by a viscously heated
accretion disc at large radii. We find that the data that deviate from the
correlation correspond to the low-intensity peaks appeared in the X-ray band
during the outburst, and suggest that these deviations are driven by the
emission from the inner part of the accretion disc.

formed much later in the history of the universe between the epoch of Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photon decoupling.
In our setup, one does not need to modify the scale-invariant inflationary
power spectra; instead, a late phase transition in strongly interacting
fermion-scalar fluid (which naturally occurs around red-shift $ 10^6 \leq \,
z_{\scriptscriptstyle T} \, \leq 10^8$ ) creates an instability in the density
perturbation as sound speed turns imaginary. As a result, the dark matter
perturbation grows exponentially in sub-Compton scales. This follows the
immediate formation of early dense dark matter halo, which finally evolves into
PBH due to cooling through scalar radiation. We calculate the variance of the
density perturbations and PBH fractional abundances $f(M)$ by using a
non-monochromatic mass function. We find the peak of our PBH mass function lies
between $10^{-16} - 10^{-14}$ solar mass for $ z_{\scriptscriptstyle T} \simeq
10^6$, and thus it can be the entire dark matter of the universe. In PBH
formation, one would expect a temporary phase where an attractive scalar
balances the Fermi pressure. We numerically confirm that such a state indeed
exists, and we find the radius and density profile of the temporary static
structure of the dark matter halo, which finally evolves to PBH due to cooling
through scalar radiation.

transition in entropy is seen in charged AdS black holes transitioning between

first-order chaotic-to-non-chaotic quantum phase transition, where the finite
extensive entropy drops to zero. This again has a gravitational analogue -- the
Hawking-Page (HP) transition between a large black hole and thermal radiation.
An analytical study of the critical phenomena associated with the continuous

sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods and uses a line search to ensure

serious measure-theoretic technicalities. In fact, by viewing the label as a

degeneracies and discontinuities that make most existing results on mean field
games inapplicable. Nonetheless, we prove existence of Markovian graphon
equilibria under fairly general assumptions, as well as uniqueness under a
monotonicity condition. Most imporantly, we show how our notion of graphon
equilibrium can be used to construct approximate equilibria for large finite

lack of players' exchangeability necessitates a careful definition of

been incorporated through the generalized $`$Romatschke-Strickland' form of the

approximation. We consider two special cases: (i) a spheroidal anisotropy with
the anisotropy vector orthogonal to the external magnetic field and (ii) an
ellipsoidal anisotropy with two mutually orthogonal vectors describing
aniostropies along and orthogonal to the field direction. The general structure

  Taint Tracking",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Outsourced computing is widely used today. However, current approaches for
protecting client data in outsourced computing fall short: use of cryptographic
techniques like fully-homomorphic encryption incurs substantial costs, whereas
use of hardware-assisted trusted execution environments has been shown to be
vulnerable to server malware, run-time attacks, and side-channel attacks.
  We present Blinded Memory (BliMe), an architecture to realize efficient and
secure outsourced computation. BliMe consists of a novel and minimal set of ISA
extensions implementing a taint-tracking policy to ensure the confidentiality
of client data even in the presence of server vulnerabilities. To secure
outsourced computation, the BliMe extensions can be used together with an
attestable, fixed-function hardware security module (HSM) and an encryption
engine that provides atomic decrypt-and-taint and encrypt-and-untaint
operations. Clients rely on remote attestation and key agreement with the HSM
to ensure that their data can be transferred securely to and from the
encryption engine and will always be protected by BliMe's taint-tracking policy
while at the server.
  We provide a machine-checked security proof of BliMe extensions, and an RTL
implementation BliMe-BOOM based on the BOOM RISC-V core. BliMe-BOOM incurs no
reduction in clock frequency relative to unmodified BOOM, nor does it use
significantly more power (<0.5%) or FPGA resources (<5.5%). Various
implementations of BliMe (on FPGA and the gem5 simulator) incur only moderate
performance overhead (8-25%).

tuning the NN architecture based on the function spaces and sample sizes. We

standard weight decay is equivalent to promoting the $\ell_p$-sparsity

recent synaptic activity are locally stored as current in superconducting

with demonstrated synaptic time constants spanning four orders of magnitude

that $x\mapsto x\phi(x)$ is also bijective. Hall and Paige conjectured in 1955
that a finite group $G$ has a complete mapping whenever $\prod_{x\in G} x$ is
the identity in the abelianization of $G$. This was confirmed in 2009 by
Wilcox, Evans, and Bray with a proof using the classification of finite simple
groups. \par In this paper, we give a combinatorial proof of a far-reaching
generalisation of the Hall-Paige conjecture for large groups. We show that for
random-like and equal-sized subsets $A,B,C$ of a group $G$, there exists a
bijection $\phi\colon A\to B$ such that $x\mapsto x\phi(x)$ is a bijection from
$A$ to $C$ whenever $\prod_{a\in A} a \prod_{b\in B} b=\prod_{c\in C} c$ in the
abelianization of $G$. We use this statement as a black-box to settle the
following old problems in combinatorial group theory for large groups. (1) We
characterise sequenceable groups, that is, groups which admit a permutation
$\pi$ of their elements such that the partial products $\pi_1$, $\pi_1\pi_2$,
$\pi_1\pi_2\cdots \pi_n$ are all distinct. This resolves a problem of Gordon
from 1961 and confirms conjectures made by several authors, including
Keedwell's 1981 conjecture that all large non-abelian groups are sequenceable.
We also characterise the related $R$-sequenceable groups, addressing a problem
of Ringel from 1974. (2) We confirm in a strong form a conjecture of Snevily
from 1999 by characterising large subsquares of multiplication tables of finite
groups that admit transversals. Previously, this characterisation was known
only for abelian groups of odd order (by a combination of papers by Alon and
Dasgupta-K\'arolyi-Serra-Szegedy and Arsovski).

UV-continuum slopes of $\beta_{\mathrm{FUV}}=-2.23\pm0.06$ and
$\beta_{\mathrm{NUV}}=-3.0\pm0.2$, and is magnified by factors $\mu\sim7-10$ in

($M_{\star}\simeq10^{7.5}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) high-redshift galaxy analog.
Notably, the blue peak of the Ly$\alpha$ profile is significantly stronger than
the red peak, which suggests an inflow of matter and possibly very low HI
column densities in its circumgalactic gas. Combined with the high lensing
magnification and image multiplicity, these properties make this galaxy a prime
candidate for follow-up observations to search for LyC emission and constrain

leading scenarios involve a double detonation in double white dwarf (WD)
systems. In these scenarios, helium shell detonation occurs on top of a
carbon-oxygen (CO) WD, which then drives the detonation of the CO-core,
producing a SN Ia. Extensive studies have been done on the possibility of a
double helium detonation, following a dynamical helium mass-transfer phase onto
a CO-WD. However, 3D self-consistent modeling of the double-WD system, the mass
transfer, and the helium shell detonation have been little studied. Here we use
3D hydrodynamical simulations to explore this case in which a helium detonation
occurs near the point of Roche lobe overflow of the donor WD and may lead to an
SN Ia through the dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6)
mechanism. We find that the helium layer of the accreting primary WD does
undergo a detonation, while the underlying carbon-oxygen core does not, leading
to an extremely rapid and faint nova-like transient instead of a luminous SN Ia
event. This failed core detonation suggests that D6 SNe Ia may be restricted to
the most massive carbon-oxygen primary WDs. We highlight the nucleosynthesis of
the long-lived radioisotope $^{44}$Ti during explosive helium burning, which
may serve as a hallmark both of successful as well as failed D6 events which
subsequently detonate as classical double-degenerate mergers.

monotonicity theorems for systems with different particle numbers in multiple

establish complete sets of zero modes of special Hamiltonians stabilizing
parton-like states. The emergent Entangled Pauli Principle (EPP), introduced in
Phys. Rev. B 98, 161118(R) (2018) and which defines the ``DNA'' of the quantum
Hall fluid, is behind the exact determination of the topological
characteristics of the fluid, including charge and braiding statistics of
excitations, and effective edge theory descriptions. When the closed-shell
condition is satisfied, the densest (i.e., the highest density and lowest total
angular momentum) zero-energy mode is a unique parton state. We conjecture that
parton-like states generally span the subspace of many-body wave functions with
the two-body $M$-clustering property within any given number of Landau levels.
General arguments are supplemented by rigorous considerations for the $M=3$
case of fermions in four Landau levels. For this case, we establish that the
zero mode counting can be done by enumerating certain patterns consistent with
an underlying EPP. We apply the coherent state approach to show that the
elementary (localized) bulk excitations are Fibonacci anyons. This demonstrates
that the DNA associated with fractional quantum Hall states encodes all
universal properties. Specifically, for parton-like states, we establish a link
with tensor network structures of finite bond dimension that emerge via root
level entanglement.

higher genus corrections and show how this differs from the usual JT gravity
calculations. In particular, the usual quotient by the mapping class group is
not enough to ensure finite answers and so we propose to extend this group with
additional elements that make the gluing integrals finite. These elements can
be thought of as large higher spin diffeomorphisms. The cylinder contribution
to the spectral form factor then behaves as $T^{N-1}$ at late times $T$,
signaling a deviation from conventional random matrix theory. To account for
this deviation, we propose that the bulk theory is dual to a matrix model
consisting of $N-1$ commuting matrices associated to the $N-1$ conserved higher
spin charges. We find further evidence for the existence of the additional
mapping class group elements by interpreting the bulk gauge theory
geometrically and employing the formalism developed by Gomis et al. in the
nineties. This formalism introduces additional (auxiliary) boundary times so
that each conserved charge generates translations in those new directions. This
allows us to find an explicit description for the $\textsf{PSL}(3,\mathbb{R})$
Schwarzian theory for the disk and trumpet and view the additional mapping
class group elements as ordinary Dehn twists, but in higher dimensions.

the observed M31 distance. Importantly, the tidal debris are distributed in

correct preferred orbital pole for both. The MW-M31 orbital geometry is
consistent with the presently observed M31 proper motion despite this not being
considered as a constraint when exploring the parameter space. The mass of the
tidal debris around the MW and M31 at $z=0$ compare well with the mass observed
in their satellite systems. The remnant discs of the two galaxies have
realistic radial scale lengths and velocity dispersions, and the simulation
naturally produces a much hotter stellar disc in M31 than in the MW. However,
reconciling this scenario with the ages of stellar populations in satellite

systems of black holes with multiple or non-spherical horizons, appearing as a
limit of regions that are narrowly enclosed by the horizons. The bubble is a
minimal cycle that links the Einstein-Rosen bridges in the system, and its
expansion occurs through the familiar stretching of space in black hole
interiors. We demonstrate this idea (which does not involve any Wick rotations)
with explicit constructions in four and five dimensions. The geometries of
expanding bubbles in these dimensions arise as a limit of, respectively, static
black hole binaries and black rings. The limit is such that the separation
between the two black holes, or the inner hole of the black ring, becomes very
small, and the horizons of the black holes correspond to acceleration horizons
of the bubbles. We also explain how a five-dimensional black hole binary gives
rise to a different type of expanding bubble. We then show that bubble
spacetimes can host black hole binaries and black rings in static equilibrium,
with their gravitational attraction being balanced against the background
spacetime expansion. Similar constructions are expected in six or more
dimensions, but most of these solutions can be obtained only numerically.
Finally, we argue that the Nariai solution can be regarded as containing an
expanding circular bubble of nothing.

quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions (QED$_3$) with an emergent
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field, which is assumed to flow to a strongly interacting
fixed point in the IR with conformal symmetry. We use recent results for the
quantum numbers of monopole operators, which tunnel $2 \pi$ fluxes of the

monopole tunneling is a symmetry-allowed relevant perturbation which induces an
(ordering) instability. We show using perturbation theory that upon twisting
the two layers the system remains unstable under the interlayer interaction,
but any finite twist angle softens this instability compared to the untwisted
case. To analyse the resulting phase induced by the (twisted) interlayer
tunneling, we use ""conformal mean field theory"", which reduces the interacting
bilayer system to two copies of QED$_3$ coupled to background fields which are
to be determined self-consistently. In the weak-coupling regime, where the
interlayer coupling is weak compared to the energy scale set by the moir\'e
lattice constant, we solve the self-consistency equations perturbatively. In
the limit of strongly coupled layers, a local scaling approximation is used,

vortices, with the lattice constant tunable through the twisting angle.

evidence for a wide variety of ISM conditions in these galaxies. Two out of the
four galaxies show CO SLEDs consistent with that of the Milky Way inner disk.
Interestingly, one of these galaxies is at $z \sim 2$ and has a CO SLED below
that of main-sequence galaxies at similar redshifts. The other two galaxies at
$z>2$ show more excited ISM conditions, with one of them showing thermal
excitation of the mid-$J$ (J$=3, 4$) levels, similar to that seen in two
massive main-sequence galaxies at these redshifts. Overall, we find that
absorption selection traces a diverse population of galaxies.

and the radiation pressure exerted on the gas in the star's atmosphere may
launch isotropic high-velocity winds. These winds will collide with the
surrounding gas producing shock-heated ($T\sim 10^7$ K) tenuous gas that
adiabatically expands and pushes on the dense gas that may otherwise be
accreted. We present a suite of 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
the collapse of massive prestellar cores and include radiative feedback from
the stellar and dust-reprocessed radiation fields, collimated outflows, and,
for the first time, isotropic stellar winds to model how these processes affect
the formation of massive stars. We find that winds are initially launched when
the massive protostar is still accreting and its wind properties evolve as the
protostar contracts to the main-sequence. Wind feedback drives asymmetric
adiabatic wind bubbles that have a bipolar morphology because the dense
circumstellar material pinches the expansion of the hot shock-heated gas. We
term this the ""wind tunnel effect."" If the core is magnetized, wind feedback is
less efficient at driving adiabatic wind bubbles initially because magnetic
tension delays their growth. We find that wind feedback eventually quenches
accretion onto $\sim$30 $\rm{M_{\rm \odot}}$ protostars that form from the
collapse of the isolated cores simulated here. Hence, our results suggest that
$\gtrsim$30 $\rm{M_{\rm \odot}}$ stars likely require larger-scale dynamical
inflows from their host cloud to overcome wind feedback. Additionally, we
discuss the implications of observing adiabatic wind bubbles with
\textit{Chandra} while the massive protostars are still highly embedded.

consistent with a population synthesis prediction of 5 per cent, for the

consistent with magnetars being drawn in an unbiased way from the natal

protoplanetary discs, but so far theoretical models have been unable to agree
on the relative roles that the X-ray, Extreme Ultraviolet or Far Ultraviolet
play in driving the winds. This has been attributed to a variety of
methodological differences between studies, including their approach to
radiative transfer and thermal balance, the choice of irradiating spectrum
employed, and the processes available to cool the gas. We use the
\textsc{mocassin} radiative transfer code to simulate wind heating for a
variety of spectra on a static density grid taken from simulations of an
EUV-driven wind. We explore the impact of choosing a single representative
X-ray frequency on their ability to drive a wind by measuring the maximum
heated column as a function of photon energy. We demonstrate that for
reasonable luminosities and spectra, the most effective energies are at a few
$100~\mathrm{eV}$, firmly in the softer regions of the X-ray spectrum, while
X-rays with energies $\sim1000~\mathrm{eV}$ interact too weakly with disc gas
to provide sufficient heating to drive a wind. We develop a simple model to
explain these findings. We argue that further increases in the cooling above
our models - for example due to molecular rovibrational lines - may further
restrict the heating to the softer energies but are unlikely to prevent X-ray
heated winds from launching entirely; increasing the X-ray luminosity has the
opposite effect. The various results of photoevaporative wind models should
therefore be understood in terms of the choice of irradiating spectrum.

thermonuclear supernovae. They are however, only predicted to last up to the
first few days following explosion. It is therefore unclear whether such
scenarios are intrinsically rare or if the relatively small sample size simply
reflects the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently early detections. To that
end, we perform toy simulations covering a range of survey depths and cadences,
and investigate the efficiency with which young type Ia supernovae are
recovered. As input for our simulations, we use models that broadly cover the
range of predicted luminosities. Based on our simulations, we find that in a
typical three day cadence survey, only $\sim$10% of type Ia supernovae would be
detected early enough to rule out the presence of an excess. A two day cadence
however, should see this increase to $\sim$15%. We find comparable results from
more detailed simulations of the Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. Using the
recovery efficiencies from these detailed simulations, we investigate the
number of young type Ia supernovae expected to be discovered assuming some

the H$\alpha$ environments of 77 type IIn supernovae using continuum subtracted

the proposed progenitors of SNe\,IIn, luminous blue variables (LBVs) as LBVs
are high mass stars that undergo dramatic episodic mass loss. However, a subset
of the NCR values follow the H$\alpha$ emission, suggesting a population of

simulation as our observed catalogue and use the reconstructed trajectories of
galaxies to model the evolution of cosmic structures. At the statistical level,
the fraction of volume (VFF) occupied by voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters
in the reconstructed catalogues agrees within $1\sigma$ with the VFF estimated
from the high-redshift snapshots of the simulation. The local accuracy of eFAM
structures is evaluated by computing their purity with respect to the simulated
catalogues, P, at the cells of a regular grid. Up to z=1.2, clusters have
0.58<P<0.93, filaments vary in 0.90<P<0.99, sheets show 0.78<P<0.92, and voids
are best identified with 0.90<P<0.92. As redshift increases, comparing
reconstructed tracers and simulated galaxies becomes more difficult due to
their different biases and number densities and the purity decreases to P~0.6.
We retrieve the environmental history of individual galaxies by tracing their
trajectories through the cosmic web and relate their observed gas fraction,
$f_\mathrm{gas}$, with the time spent within different structures. For galaxies
in clusters and filaments, eFAM reproduces the variation of $f_\mathrm{gas}$ as
a function of the redshift of accretion/infall as traced by the simulations
with a 1.5 $\sigma$ statistical agreement (which decreases to 2.5 $\sigma$
statistical agreement for low-mass galaxies in filaments). These results
support the application of eFAM to observational data to study the
environmental dependence of observed galaxy properties, offering a
complementary approach to that based on light-cone observations.

whose Lagrangian density is a two-variable function of a scalar field $\phi$
and its kinetic energy $X\equiv \frac{1}{2}\partial^\mu\phi \partial_\mu\phi$.
In the thawing scenario, the scalar field becomes dynamic only when the Hubble
friction drops below its mass scale in the late universe. Thawing k-essence
dark energy models can be randomly sampled by generating the Taylor expansion
coefficients of its Lagrangian density from random matrices \cite{thaws}. Ref.
\cite{thaws} points out that the non-uniform distribution of effective equation
of state parameters $(w_0, w_a)$ of thawing k-essence model can be used to
improve the statistics of model selection. The present work studies the
statistics of thawing k-essence in a more general framework that is
Parameterized by the Age of the universe (PAge) \cite{PAge}. For fixed matter
fraction $\Omega_m$, the random thawing k-essence models cluster in a narrow
band in the PAge parameter space, providing a strong theoretical prior. We
simulate cosmic shear power spectrum data for the Chinese Space Station
Telescope optical survey, and compare the fisher forecast with and without the
theoretical prior of thawing k-essence. For an optimal tomography binning
scheme, the theoretical prior improves the figure of merit in PAge space by a
factor of $3.3$.

reproduced the $p_T$ spectra with reasonable agreement for most of the $p_T$

Furthermore, to analyze the $p_T$ spectra of charged hadrons measured by the

Boltzmann distribution) and the $q$-dual function (from the $q$-dual

properties of hadronic matter at high energy. We have also applied the two
analytic functions over the model predictions. The values extracted by the

different phase angles reveals the degree of polarization to be comparable to
Jupiter family comets at similar phase angles. Localized variations in

suggest the presence of high amount of silicate/low absorbing material and
indicate the coma to be dominated by higher amount of large size grains with

problem of the DCF to be its disregard of the anisotropic character of MHD
turbulence. On the basis of the modern MHD turbulence theory we introduce a new
way of obtaining magnetic field strength from observations. Unlike the DCF, the
new technique uses not the dispersion of the polarization angle and line of
sight velocities, but increments of these quantities given by the structure
functions. To address the variety of the astrophysical conditions for which our
technique can be applied, we consider the turbulence in both media with
magnetic pressure larger than the gas pressure corresponding e.g. to molecular
and the gas pressure larger than the magnetic pressure corresponding to the
warm neutral medium. We provide general expressions for arbitrary admixture of
Alfv\'en, slow and fast modes in these media and consider in detail the
particular cases relevant to diffuse media and molecular clouds. We
successfully test our results using synthetic observations obtained from MHD
turbulence simulations. We demonstrate that our Differential Measure Approach
(DMA), unlike the DCF, can be used to measure the distribution of magnetic
field strengths, can provide magnetic field measurements with limited data and
is much more stable in the presence of large scale variations induces of

Motivated by analytic and geometric considerations, and in particular
Jauregui's definition of capacity-volume mass and Jauregui and Lee's results on
the lower semicontinuity of the ADM mass and Huisken's isoperimetric mass, we
investigate how the capacity functional behaves when the background spaces

local integral current spaces converging in the pointed Sormani--Wenger
intrinsic flat sense. For the case of volume-preserving ($\mathcal{VF}$)
convergence, we prove two theorems that demonstrate an upper semicontinuity

approach is motivated by Portegies' investigation of the semicontinuity of
eigenvalues under $\mathcal{VF}$ convergence. We include examples to show the
semicontinuity may be strict, and that the volume-preserving hypothesis is
necessary. Finally, there is a discussion on how capacity and our results may

dwarf found by means of the NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC) DR2. NSC's angular
resolution of $\sim$1"" allows for the detection of small separation binaries
with significant proper motions. We used the catalog's accurate proper motion
measurements to identify the companions by cross-matching a previously compiled
list of brown dwarf candidates with NSC DR2. The comoving pairs consist of
either a very low-mass star and an ultra-cool companion, or a white dwarf and
an ultra-cool companion. The estimated spectral types of the primaries are in
the K and M dwarf regimes, those of the secondaries in the M, L and T dwarf
regimes. We calculated angular separations between $\sim$2 and $\sim$56"",
parallactic distances between $\sim$43 and $\sim$261 pc and projected physical
separations between $\sim$169 and $\sim$8487 AU. The lowest measured total
proper motion is 97 mas yr$^{-1}$, the highest 314 mas yr$^{-1}$. Tangential
velocities range from $\sim$23 to $\sim$187 km s$^{-1}$. We also determined
comoving probabilities, estimated mass ratios and calculated binding energies
for each system. We found no indication of possible binarity for any component
of the 34 systems in the published literature. The discovered systems can
contribute to the further study of the formation and evolution of low-mass
systems as well as to the characterization of cool substellar objects.

costly Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet very

resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy, are two of the main bottlenecks for

novel FL framework with partial model aggregation (PMA). This approach
aggregates the lower layers of neural networks, responsible for feature
extraction, at the parameter server while keeping the upper layers, responsible
for complex pattern recognition, at devices for personalization. The proposed
PMA-FL is able to address the data heterogeneity and reduce the transmitted
information in wireless channels. Then, we derive a convergence bound of the
framework under a non-convex loss function setting to reveal the role of
unbalanced data size in the learning performance. On this basis, we maximize
the scheduled data size to minimize the global loss function through jointly
optimize the device scheduling, bandwidth allocation, computation and
communication time division policies with the assistance of Lyapunov
optimization. Our analysis reveals that the optimal time division is achieved
when the communication and computation parts of PMA-FL have the same power. We
also develop a bisection method to solve the optimal bandwidth allocation
policy and use the set expansion algorithm to address the device scheduling
policy. Compared with the benchmark schemes, the proposed PMA-FL improves
3.13\% and 11.8\% accuracy on two typical datasets with heterogeneous data

For generations, this question has
occupied a central place in the philosophy of science, stimulating heated
debates, but yielding no clear consensus. Many proposed explanations can be
understood in terms of whether and how they view the expansion of knowledge as
proceeding through the accretion of scientific concepts into larger conceptual
structures. Here, we examine these views empirically, performing a large-scale
analysis of the physical and social sciences, spanning five decades. Using
techniques from natural language processing, we create semantic networks of
concepts, wherein single- and multi-word noun phrases become linked when they
are used in the same paper abstract. For both the physical and social sciences,
we observe increasingly rigid conceptual cores (i.e., densely connected sets of
highly central nodes) accompanied by the proliferation of periphery concepts
(i.e., sparsely connected nodes that are highly connected to the core). In the
physical sciences, these changes coincide with an increasing number of cores,
while in the social sciences, the number of cores is decreasing. In subsequent
analyses, we examine the relationship between conceptual structure and the
growth of scientific knowledge, finding that scientific works are more
innovative in fields with cores that have higher conceptual churn, with larger
cores, and an overall smaller number of cores, the latter of which is also
associated with more scientific consensus. Overall, our findings suggest that
while the organization of scientific concepts is important for the growth of
knowledge, the mechanisms vary across fields and time.

observational data. Our approach, implemented in CRIKit (the Constitutive
Relation Inference Toolkit), is to model the material time derivative of damage
as a frame-invariant neural network, and to optimize the parameters of the
model from simulations of the flow of an ice dome. Using the model of Albrecht
and Levermann as the ground truth to generate synthetic observations, we
measure the difference of optimized neural network models from that model to
try to understand how well this process generates models that can then transfer
to other ice sheet simulations.
  The use of so-called ""deep-learning"" models for constitutive equations,
equations of state, sub-grid-scale processes, and other pointwise relations
that appear in systems of PDEs has been successful in other disciplines, yet
our inference setting has some confounding factors. The first is the type of
observations that are available: we compare the quality of the inferred models
when the loss of the numerical simulations includes observation misfits
throughout the ice, which is unobtainable in real settings, to losses that
include only combinations of surface and borehole observations. The second
confounding factor is the evolution of damage in an ice sheet, which is
advection dominated. The non-local effect of perturbations in a damage models
results in loss functions that have both many local minima and many parameter
configurations for which the system is unsolvable.
  Our experience suggests that basic neural networks have several deficiencies
that affect the quality of the optimized models. We suggest several approaches
to incorporating additional inductive biases into neural networks which may
lead to better performance in future work.

black hole for the boundary conformal field theory. The orbits are long-lived
states that eventually decay due to gravitational radiation and tunneling. They
appear as narrow resonances in the heavy-light OPE when the spectrum becomes
effectively continuous due to the presence of the black hole horizon.
Alternatively, they can be identified with quasi-normal modes with small
imaginary part in the thermal two-point function. The two pictures are related
via the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis. When the decay effects can be
neglected the orbits appear as a discrete family of double-twist operators. We
investigate the connection between orbits, quasi-normal modes, and double-twist
operators in detail. Using the corrected Bohr-Sommerfeld formula for
quasi-normal modes, we compute the anomalous dimension of double-twist
operators. We compare our results to the prediction of the light-cone
bootstrap, finding perfect agreement where the results overlap. We also compute
the orbit decay time due to scalar radiation and compare it to the tunneling
rate. Perturbatively in spin, in the light-cone bootstrap framework
double-twist operators appear as a small fraction of the Hilbert space which
violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, a phenomenon known as
many-body scars. Nonperturbatively in spin, the double-twist operators become
long-lived states that eventually thermalize. We briefly discuss the connection
between perturbative scars in holographic theories and known examples of scars

Commonly used single-trait analysis methods are conservative, while multi-trait

decentralized manner at the subsystem level with minimal information sharing
among the subsystems. Compared to our most recent work on the same topic, we
consider a substantially more generalized problem setup in this paper and
develop decentralized processes to verify and ensure a broader range of
networked system properties. We show that for such decentralized processes:
optimizing the used subsystem indexing scheme can substantially reduce the
required inter-subsystem information-sharing sessions, and in some network
topologies, information sharing among only neighboring subsystems is sufficient
(distributed!). Moreover, the proposed networked system analysis and control
synthesis processes are compositional/resilient to subsystem removals, which
enable them to conveniently and efficiently handle situations where new
subsystems are being added/removed to/from an existing network. We also provide
significant insights into our decentralized approach so that it can be quickly
adopted to verify and ensure properties beyond the stability and dissipativity

also derived new centralized solutions for dissipative observer and dynamic

understand and embed the domain-specific logic. This is because application
logic must be encoded to some extent in both the server and client sides.
  In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, which allows the
specification of application logic to reside solely on the cloud. We have built
a system where reusable application components can be assembled on the cloud in
different logical chains and the client is largely decoupled from this logic
and is solely concerned with how data is displayed and gathered from users of
the application. In this way, the chaining of requests and responses is done by
the cloud and the client side has no knowledge of the application logic.
  An additional effect of our approach is that the client side developer is
able to immediately see any changes they make, while executing the logic
residing on the cloud. This further allows more novice programmers to perform
these customizations, as they do not need to `get the full application working'
and are able to see the results of their code as they go, thereby lowering the
obstacles to businesses and individuals to produce and maintain applications.
Furthermore, this decoupling enables the quick generation and customization of
a variety of application clients, ranging from web to mobile devices and
personal assistants, while customizing one or more as needed.

heterostructures composed of atomically thin layers of transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) give an opportunity to realize excitons with high

excitonic quantum phenomena and excitonic devices. Propagation of IXs in TMD
heterostructures is intensively studied. However, in spite of long IX
lifetimes, orders of magnitude longer than lifetimes of spatially direct
excitons (DXs), a relatively short-range IX propagation with the $1/e$ decay
distances $d_{1/e}$ up to few $\mu$m was reported in the studies of TMD
heterostructures. The short-range of IX propagation originates from in-plane
potentials, which localize excitons and suppress exciton transport. In
particular, significant in-plane moir\'e potentials predicted in TMD
heterostructures can cause an obstacle for IX propagation. In this work, we
realize in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure a macroscopically long-range IX
propagation with $d_{1/e}$ reaching $\sim 100$ $\mu$m. The strong enhancement
of IX propagation is realized using an optical excitation resonant to DXs in
the heterostructure. The strong enhancement of IX propagation originates from
the suppression of IX localization and scattering and is observed in the
quantum regime.

not all communication occurs using the same mechanism. Here, we analyze the
energy efficiency of intercellular signaling by two canonical mechanisms:
diffusion of signaling molecules and direct transport mediated by signaling
cellular protrusions. We show that efficient contact formation for direct
transport can be established by an optimal rate of projecting protrusions,
which depends on the availability of information about the location of the
target cell. The optimal projection rate also depends on how signaling
molecules are transported along the protrusion, in particular the ratio of the
energy cost for contact formation and molecule synthesis. Also, we compare the
efficiency of the two signaling mechanisms, under various model parameters. We
find that the direct transport is favored over the diffusion when transporting
a large amount of signaling molecules. There is a critical number of signaling
molecules at which the efficiency of the two mechanisms are the same. The
critical number is small when the distance between cells is far, which helps
explain why protrusion-based mechanisms are observed in long-range cellular
communications.

effective fields as well as the associated spin Hall angles can be reliably
obtained by performing the dependence of ST-FMR by an added dc current. The sum
of the spin Hall angles for both the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin
anomalous Hall effect (SAHE) symmetries are: $\theta_{DL}^{SAHE} +
\theta_{DL}^{SHE}=-0.15 \pm 0.05$ and $\theta_{FL}^{SAHE} +
\theta_{FL}^{SHE}=0.026 \pm 0.005$. From the symmetry of ST-FMR signals we find
that $\theta_{DL}^{SHE}$ is positive and dominated by the negative
$\theta_{DL}^{SAHE}$. The present study paves the way for tuning the different
symmetries in spin conversion in highly efficient ferrimagnetic systems.

a completely focused image by integrating focused and un-focused pixels. Most
existing methods suffer from shift variance, misregistered images, and
data-dependent. In this study, we introduce a novel gradient information-based
multi-focus image fusion method that is robust for the aforementioned problems.
The proposed method first generates gradient images from original images by
using Halftoning-Inverse Halftoning (H-IH) transform. Then, Energy of Gradient
(EOG) and Standard Deviation functions are used as the focus measurement on the
gradient images to form a fused image. Finally, in order to enhance the fused
image a decision fusion approach is applied with the majority voting method.
The proposed method is compared with 17 different novel and conventional
techniques both visually and objectively. For objective evaluation, 6 different
quantitative metrics are used. It is observed that the proposed method is
promising according to visual evaluation and 83.3% success is achieved by being
first in five out of six metrics according to objective evaluation.

horocycle flow on flat projective bundles over hyperbolic surfaces and we
derive ergodic consequences. If $\rho : \Gamma \to {\rm PSL}(n+1,\mathbb{R})$
is a representation of a non-elementary Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, the unit
tangent bundle $Y$ associated to the flat projective bundle defined by $\rho$
admits a natural action of the affine group $B$ obtained by combining the
foliated geodesic and horocycle flows. If the image $\rho(\Gamma)$ satisfies
Conze-Guivarc'h conditions, namely strong irreducibility and proximality, the
dynamics of the $B$-action is captured by the proximal dynamics of
$\rho(\Gamma)$ on $\mathbb{R}{\rm P}^n$ (Theorem A). In fact, the dynamics of
the foliated horocycle flow on the unique $B$-minimal subset of $Y$ can be
described in terms of dynamics of the horocycle flow on the non-wandering set
in the unit tangent bundle $X$ of the surface $S= \Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$

the $B$-minimal set is an attractor for the foliated horocycle flow restricted

corollary, we deduce that the restricted flow admits a unique conservative
ergodic $U$-invariant Radon measure (defined up to a multiplicative constant)

two point sets, and it is a common task in different domains, especially in the
automotive and mobile robotics domains. Lots of approaches are proposed in the

this vein, which builds an explicit correspondence between both point sets to
achieve the registration task. However, this work is interested in achieving
the registration without building any explicit correspondence between both
point sets, following a probabilistic framework.
  The most critical task in point set registration is how to elaborate the cost
function, which measures the distance between both point sets. The
probabilistic framework includes two possible ways to build the cost function:
The summing and the likelihood. The main focus of this work is to analyze and
compare the behavior of both approaches. Therefore, a 1D synthetic scenario is
used to build the cost function step by step, besides the estimation error.
Finally, this work uses two data sets for evaluation: A 2D synthetic data set
and a real data set. The evaluation process compares and analyzes the
estimation error and estimated uncertainty. Thus, two different methods are
used in the evaluation process: The normalized estimation error squared NEES
and noncredibility index NCI. A 77 GHz automotive Doppler radar provides the
real data set, and in the real evaluation, we evaluate the ego-motion
estimation of a robot as an application for the registration.

$\Sigma$ is given by the appropriate moduli space of Riemann surfaces. We use
geometric quantization to compute partition functions of chiral gravity on
three-manifolds of the form $\Sigma \times \mathrm{S}^1$, where $\Sigma$ can
have asymptotic boundaries. Most of these topologies do not admit a classical
solution and are thus not amenable to a direct semiclassical path integral
computation. We use an index theorem that expresses the partition function as
an integral of characteristic classes over phase space. In the presence of $n$
asymptotic boundaries, we use techniques from equivariant cohomology to
localize the integral to a finite-dimensional integral over
$\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$, which we evaluate in low genus cases. Higher
genus partition functions quickly become complicated since they depend in an
oscillatory way on Newton's constant. There is a precise sense in which one can
isolate the non-oscillatory part which we call the fake partition function. We
establish that there is a topological recursion that computes the fake

Such verification is challenging since smart contract execution is

Performing stochastic simulations, we show that mobility unevenness controls

being preponderant if the mobility limitations are substantial. If two species
face mobility limitations, our outcomes show that being higher dispersive does

organisms move with higher mobility, they expose themselves to enemies more
frequently, being more vulnerable to being eliminated. Finally, our findings
show that biodiversity benefits in regions where species are slowed.
Biodiversity loss for high mobility organisms, common to cyclic systems, may be
avoided with coexistence probability being higher for robust mobility
limitations. Our results may help biologists understand the dynamics of

solar-wind bulk speed $V$ that correlate/anti-correlate with the spikes seen in
the radial-field component $B_R$. In the solar-wind streams that we analyzed,
these specific SB features near 1 au are associated with large-amplitude
Alfv\'enic oscillations that propagate outward from the sun along a local
background (prevalent) magnetic field $\bf{B}_0$ that is nearly radial. We also
show that, when $\bf{B}_0$ is nearly perpendicular to the radial direction, the
large amplitude Alfv\'enic oscillations display variations in $V$ that are
two-sided (i.e., $V$ alternately increases and decreases depending on the
vector $\Delta\bf{B}=\bf{B} - \bf{B}_0$). As a consequence, SBs may not appear
always as one-sided spikes in $V$, especially at larger heliocentric distances
where the local background field statistically departs from the radial
direction. We suggest that SBs can be well described by large-amplitude
Alfv\'enic fluctuations if the field rotation is computed with respect to a
well-determined local background field that, in some cases, may deviate from

fit the multi-band light curves with a magnetar spin-down model using the
Modular Open-Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT). Comparing the magnetar
engine and ejecta parameter distributions of the photometric sample to those of
the PS1-MDS spectroscopic sample and a larger literature spectroscopic sample,
we find that these samples are overall consistent, but that the photometric
sample extends to slower spins and lower ejecta masses, which correspond to
lower luminosity events, as expected for photometric selection. While our

reducing power consumption or update costs(e.g., CoolCAM [32] and TreeCAM

easily be implemented in modern reconfigurable pipeline chips such as Tofino-3.
MashUp uses a new technique, tiling trees, which takes into account TCAM grain

TCAM grain sizes (44 by 512), there was a 2X reduction in TCAM required.
Further, if we mix TCAM and SRAM using a new technique we call node

constant objects in two and three dimensions using PaLEnTIR, a significantly
enhanced Parametric level set (PaLS) model relative to the current
state-of-the-art. The primary contribution of this paper is a new PaLS
formulation which requires only a single level set function to recover a scene
with piecewise constant objects possessing multiple unknown contrasts. Our
model offers distinct advantages over current approaches to the multi-contrast,
multi-object problem, all of which require multiple level sets and explicit
estimation of the contrast magnitudes. Given upper and lower bounds on the
contrast, our approach is able to recover objects with any distribution of
contrasts and eliminates the need to know either the number of contrasts in a
given scene or their values. We provide an iterative process for finding these
space-varying contrast limits. Relative to most PaLS methods which employ
radial basis functions (RBFs), our model makes use of non-isotropic basis
functions, thereby expanding the class of shapes that a PaLS model of a given
complexity can approximate. Finally, PaLEnTIR improves the conditioning of the
Jacobian matrix required as part of the parameter identification process and
consequently accelerates the optimization methods by controlling the magnitude
of the PaLS expansion coefficients, fixing the centers of the basis functions,
and the uniqueness of parametric to image mappings provided by the new
parameterization. We demonstrate the performance of the new approach using both
2D and 3D variants of X-ray computed tomography, diffuse optical tomography
(DOT), denoising, deconvolution problems. Application to experimental sparse CT
data and simulated data with different types of noise are performed to further
validate the proposed method.

with growing dataset volumes of the modern era, make the issue of
computationally-efficient analysis with missing data of crucial practical
importance. A general computationally-efficient estimation framework for
dealing with missing data is the pseudo-expected estimating equations (PEEE)
approach. The method is applicable with any parametric model for which
estimation involves the solution of a set of estimating equations, such as
likelihood score equations. A key limitation of the PEEE approach is that there
is currently no closed-form variance estimator, and variance estimation
requires the computationally burdensome bootstrap method. In this work, we
address the gap and provide a closed-form variance estimator whose computation
can be significantly faster than a bootstrap approach. Our variance estimator
is shown to be consistent even with auxiliary variables and under misspecified
models for the incomplete variables. Simulation studies show that our variance
estimator performs well and that its computation can be over 50 times faster
than the bootstrap. The computational efficiency gain from our proposed
variance estimator is crucial with large datasets or when the main analysis
method is computationally intensive. Finally, the PEEE approach along with our

clustering is further combined with scalable Gaussian process regression (GPR)
or linear regression (LR) to learn molecular energies accurately by generating
a local regression model in each cluster. Among all four combinations of
regressors and clustering methods, GMM combined with scalable exact Gaussian

has given rise to the pressing need to consider risk in both the synthesis and
verification of policies for these systems. This paper aims to address a few
problems regarding risk-aware verification and policy synthesis, by first
developing a sample-based method to bound the risk measure evaluation of a
random variable whose distribution is unknown. These bounds permit us to
generate high-confidence verification statements for a large class of robotic
systems. Second, we develop a sample-based method to determine solutions to
non-convex optimization problems that outperform a large fraction of the
decision space of possible solutions. Both sample-based approaches then permit
us to rapidly synthesize risk-aware policies that are guaranteed to achieve a
minimum level of system performance. To showcase our approach in simulation, we
verify a cooperative multi-agent system and develop a risk-aware controller
that outperforms the system's baseline controller. We also mention how our
approach can be extended to account for any $g$-entropic risk measure - the
subset of coherent risk measures on which we focus.

  The classical algorithm for this problem is the multiplicative weights

weights for every expert, and uses $\Omega(n)$ memory. There is little work on
understanding the memory required to solve the online learning with expert

streaming models, which is especially important when the number of experts, as
well as the number of days on which the experts make predictions, is large.
  We initiate the study of the learning with expert advice problem in the
streaming setting, and show lower and upper bounds. Our lower bound for i.i.d.,
random order, and adversarial order streams uses a reduction to a custom-built

necessary memory. For random-order streams, we show that our upper bound is
tight up to low order terms. We hope that these results and techniques will

First-order risks stem from aspects of the ML system, while second-order risks
stem from the consequences of first-order risks. These consequences are system
failures that result from design and development choices. We explore how
different risks may manifest in various types of ML systems, the factors that
affect each risk, and how first-order risks may lead to second-order effects
when the system interacts with the real world.
  Throughout the paper, we show how real events and prior research fit into our
Machine Learning System Risk framework (MLSR). MLSR operates on ML systems
rather than technologies or domains, recognizing that a system's design,
implementation, and use case all contribute to its risk. In doing so, it
unifies the risks that are commonly discussed in the ethical AI community
(e.g., ethical/human rights risks) with system-level risks (e.g., application,
design, control risks), paving the way for holistic risk assessments of ML
systems.

use of non-expert annotators producing taxonomies of limited granularity (e.g.
soil, sand, bedrock, float rock, etc.), or rely on generic class discovery
approaches that tend to produce perceptual classes such as rover parts and
landscape, which are irrelevant to geologic analysis. Expert-labeled datasets
containing granular geological/geomorphological terrain categories are rare or
inaccessible to public, and sometimes require the extraction of relevant
categorical information from complex annotations. In order to facilitate the
creation of a dataset with detailed terrain categories, we present a
self-supervised method that can cluster sedimentary textures in images captured
from the Mast camera onboard the Curiosity rover (Mars Science Laboratory). We
then present a qualitative analysis of these clusters and describe their
geologic significance via the creation of a set of granular terrain categories.
The precision and geologic validation of these automatically discovered

important geologic features and will therefore facilitate our long-term goal of

an urgent research hotspot due to its ability of enabling fast and flexible
information extraction on remote sensing (RS) images. However, current RSCTIR
methods mainly focus on global features of RS images, which leads to the
neglect of local features that reflect target relationships and saliency. In
this article, we first propose a novel RSCTIR framework based on global and
local information (GaLR), and design a multi-level information dynamic fusion
(MIDF) module to efficaciously integrate features of different levels. MIDF
leverages local information to correct global information, utilizes global
information to supplement local information, and uses the dynamic addition of
the two to generate prominent visual representation. To alleviate the pressure
of the redundant targets on the graph convolution network (GCN) and to improve
the model s attention on salient instances during modeling local features, the
de-noised representation matrix and the enhanced adjacency matrix (DREA) are
devised to assist GCN in producing superior local representations. DREA not
only filters out redundant features with high similarity, but also obtains more
powerful local features by enhancing the features of prominent objects.
Finally, to make full use of the information in the similarity matrix during
inference, we come up with a plug-and-play multivariate rerank (MR) algorithm.
The algorithm utilizes the k nearest neighbors of the retrieval results to
perform a reverse search, and improves the performance by combining multiple
components of bidirectional retrieval. Extensive experiments on public datasets
strongly demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GaLR methods on the
RSCTIR task. The code of GaLR method, MR algorithm, and corresponding files

aesthetic images. In recent years, there has been a transformation in camera
design from being purely physics-driven to increasingly data-driven and
task-specific. In this paper, we present a framework to understand the building
blocks of this nascent field of end-to-end design of camera hardware and
algorithms. As part of this framework, we show how methods that exploit both
physics and data have become prevalent in imaging and computer vision,
underscoring a key trend that will continue to dominate the future of
task-specific camera design. Finally, we share current barriers to progress in
end-to-end design, and hypothesize how these barriers can be overcome.

location, which is typically addressed by an increased radiation area and a
decreased dose. As a result, the treatments' efficacy is reduced. The recently
proposed hybrid MR-linac scanner holds the promise to efficiently deal with
such respiratory motion through real-time adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy
(MRgRT). For MRgRT, motion-fields should be estimated from MR-data and the
radiotherapy plan should be adapted in real-time according to the estimated
motion-fields. All of this should be performed with a total latency of
maximally 200 ms, including data acquisition and reconstruction. A measure of
confidence in such estimated motion-fields is highly desirable, for instance to
ensure the patient's safety in case of unexpected and undesirable motion. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Gaussian Processes to infer 3D
motion-fields and uncertainty maps in real-time from only three readouts of
MR-data. We demonstrated an inference frame rate up to 69 Hz including data
acquisition and reconstruction, thereby exploiting the limited amount of
required MR-data. Additionally, we designed a rejection criterion based on the
motion-field uncertainty maps to demonstrate the framework's potential for
quality assurance. The framework was validated in silico and in vivo on healthy
volunteer data (n=5) acquired using an MR-linac, thereby taking into account
different breathing patterns and controlled bulk motion. Results indicate
end-point-errors with a 75th percentile below 1mm in silico, and a correct
detection of erroneous motion estimates with the rejection criterion.
Altogether, the results show the potential of the framework for application in
real-time MR-guided radiotherapy with an MR-linac.

ejections (CMEs) is critical to understanding the solar-terrestrial
relationship. For the first time, Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO,
providing multiple views of CMEs in the heliosphere, observed the vast and
crucial observational gap between the Sun and the Earth. Using J-maps
constructed from coronagraphs (CORs) and HIs observations, we continuously
tracked different density enhanced features of CMEs. We implemented several
reconstruction methods to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of
CMEs during their evolution from the Sun to Earth. Our study provides evidence
that the 3D speeds of CMEs near the Sun are not reasonably sufficient for
understanding the propagation and accurate forecasting of the arrival time at
the Earth of a majority of CMEs. This finding can be due to many factors that
significantly change the CME kinematics beyond the COR field of view, such as
the interaction/collision of two or more CMEs or the interaction of CMEs with
the ambient solar wind medium. We attempted to understand the evolution and
consequences of the interacting/colliding CMEs in the heliosphere using
STEREO/HI, WIND, and ACE observations. The study found a significant change in
the dynamics of the CMEs after their collision and interaction. The in situ
observations show the signatures of CME-CME interaction as heating and
compression, formation of magnetic holes (MHs), and interaction region (IR). We
also noticed that long-lasting IR, formed at the rear edge of preceding CME, is
responsible for large geomagnetic perturbations. Our study highlights the
significance of using HIs observations in studying heliospheric evolution of
CMEs, CME-CME collision, identifying and associating the three-part structure
of CMEs in their remote and in situ observations, and hence for improved space
weather forecasting.

structure extracts the corresponding accent information and transforms the
input acoustic feature into an accent-related feature through the linear
combination of all accent bases. We further explore the injection position of
the adaptation layer, the number of accent bases, and different types of accent
bases to achieve better accent adaptation. Experimental results show that the

physical consequences to black holes. However, no physical principle has so far
been known for the identification. Here we propose that the consistency of the
first law of thermodynamics is the principle that should determine physically
sensible scale identification, at least close to the horizon. We show that this
leads to a natural solution that the Newton coupling should be a function of
the horizon area and find a universal formula for the quantum entropy, which
agrees with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for constant Newton
coupling, for Kerr black holes and other higher-dimensional black holes. This
suggests that the Newton coupling is a function of the area near the horizon,
and also away to infinity, where the quantum effects may not be so important.

power-efficient as it imitates the fundamental mechanism of the human brain.
Recently, backpropagation (BP) based SNN learning algorithms that utilize deep
learning frameworks have achieved good performance. However,
bio-interpretability is partially neglected in those BP-based algorithms.
Toward bio-plausible BP-based SNNs, we consider three properties in modeling
spike activities: Multiplicity, Adaptability, and Plasticity (MAP). In terms of
multiplicity, we propose a Multiple-Spike Pattern (MSP) with multiple spike
transmission to strengthen model robustness in discrete time-iteration. To
realize adaptability, we adopt Spike Frequency Adaption (SFA) under MSP to
decrease spike activities for improved efficiency. For plasticity, we propose a
trainable convolutional synapse that models spike response current to enhance
the diversity of spiking neurons for temporal feature extraction. The proposed
SNN model achieves competitive performances on neuromorphic datasets: N-MNIST
and SHD. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed three
aspects are significant to iterative robustness, spike efficiency, and temporal
feature extraction capability of spike activities. In summary, this work
proposes a feasible scheme for bio-inspired spike activities with MAP, offering
a new neuromorphic perspective to embed biological characteristics into spiking
neural networks.

evolutions. OsC modes are rotationally stabilized convective modes in the
convective core and they resonantly excite low frequency $g$-modes to obtain
large amplitudes in the envelope when the rotation rate of the core is larger
than critical rates. We use, for a network of three-mode couplings, amplitude
equations governing the time evolution of the mode amplitudes where each of
three-mode couplings is assumed to occur between two stable modes and one
unstable mode. Assuming that the unstable modes in the couplings are OsC modes
in the core and the stable modes are $g$- and $r$-modes in the envelope, we
integrate the amplitude equations to see how the $g$- and $r$-modes are
non-linearly excited by the OsC modes and whether or not the amplitude
evolutions tend toward a state of finite amplitudes. We find that the
non-linear three-mode couplings do excite low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes but
they are not necessarily effective to achieve amplitude saturation since the
three-mode couplings between the OsC modes with large growth rates and $g$- and
$r$-modes with small damping rates tend to destabilize amplitude evolutions.

resolution of a low frame-rate video, by interpolating novel frames between
existing temporally sparse frames. This paper presents a self-supervised
approach to video frame interpolation that requires only a single video. We
pose the video as a set of layers. Each layer is parameterized by two implicit
neural networks -- one for learning a static frame and the other for a
time-varying motion field corresponding to video dynamics. Together they
represent an occlusion-free subset of the scene with a pseudo-depth channel. To
model inter-layer occlusions, all layers are lifted to the 2.5D space so that
the frontal layer occludes distant layers. This is done by assigning each layer
a depth channel, which we call `pseudo-depth', whose partial order defines the
occlusion between layers. The pseudo-depths are converted to visibility values
through a fully differentiable SoftMin function so that closer layers are more
visible than layers in a distance. On the other hand, we parameterize the video
motions by solving an ordinary differentiable equation (ODE) defined on a
time-varying neural velocity field that guarantees valid motions. This implicit
neural representation learns the video as a space-time continuum, allowing
frame interpolation at any temporal resolution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on real-world datasets, where our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-arts that require ground truth labels

information from support image-mask pairs, resulting in various segmentation
failures, e.g., incomplete objects, ambiguous boundaries, and distractor
activation. To this end, we propose a simple yet versatile framework in the
spirit of divide-and-conquer. Specifically, a novel self-reasoning scheme is
first implemented on the annotated support image, and then the coarse
segmentation mask is divided into multiple regions with different properties.
Leveraging effective masked average pooling operations, a series of
support-induced proxies are thus derived, each playing a specific role in
conquering the above challenges. Moreover, we devise a unique parallel decoder
structure that integrates proxies with similar attributes to boost the
discrimination power. Our proposed approach, named divide-and-conquer proxies
(DCP), allows for the development of appropriate and reliable information as a

Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate the superiority of
DCP over conventional prototype-based approaches (up to 5~10% on average),

to consider a reweighting by $\prod_{B\subseteq [n]} e^{\sigma_B N_B}$, where
$\sigma_B$ are real constants and $N_B$ is the number of CLE loops surrounding
the points $z_i$ for $i\in B$. This is made precise via an approximation

$\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$. We define the partition function of the surface and
explain its relationship to Liouville conformal field theory (CFT) correlation
functions and a potential relationship with a CFT for CLE. In the case of
$n\in\{0,1\}$ points we derive an explicit formula for the partition function.
Furthermore, we obtain a recursive formula for the partition functions where we
express the $n$ point partition function in terms of the partition function for
disks with $k<n$ marked points, and we use this to partially determine for
which values of $(\sigma_B\colon B\subseteq [n])$ the partition function is
finite. The recursive formula is derived via a continuum counterpart of the
peeling process on planar maps, which was earlier studied in works of Miller,
Sheffield, and Werner in the setting of $n=0$ marked points. We also find an
explicit formula for the generator of the Markov process describing the LQG
boundary lengths in the continuum peeling process. Via an explicit calculation
for this Markov process for $n=0$ we give a new proof for the law of the
conformal radius of the outermost CLE loop in the unit disk around 0, which was

  Roux","STFT-Domain Neural Speech Enhancement with Very Low Algorithmic Latency","in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning based speech enhancement in the short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) domain typically uses a large window length such as 32 ms. A larger
window can lead to higher frequency resolution and potentially better
enhancement. This however incurs an algorithmic latency of 32 ms in an online
setup, because the overlap-add algorithm used in the inverse STFT (iSTFT) is
also performed using the same window size. To reduce this inherent latency, we
adapt a conventional dual-window-size approach, where a regular input window
size is used for STFT but a shorter output window is used for overlap-add, for
STFT-domain deep learning based frame-online speech enhancement. Based on this
STFT-iSTFT configuration, we employ complex spectral mapping for frame-online
enhancement, where a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to predict the real
and imaginary (RI) components of target speech from the mixture RI components.
In addition, we use the DNN-predicted RI components to conduct frame-online
beamforming, the results of which are used as extra features for a second DNN
to perform frame-online post-filtering. The frequency-domain beamformer can be
easily integrated with our DNNs and is designed to not incur any algorithmic
latency. Additionally, we propose a future-frame prediction technique to
further reduce the algorithmic latency. Evaluation on noisy-reverberant speech
enhancement shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared with
Conv-TasNet, our STFT-domain system can achieve better enhancement performance
for a comparable amount of computation, or comparable performance with less
computation, maintaining strong performance at an algorithmic latency as low as
2 ms.

protocluster Sgr B2(N) permitted by the advent of ALMA revealed a new dimension
of interstellar chemistry. Astrochemical simulations subsequently predicted
that beyond a certain degree of molecular complexity, branched molecules could
even dominate over their straight-chain isomers. More generally, we aim at
probing further the presence in the ISM of complex organic molecules with the
capacity to exhibit both a normal and iso form, via the attachment of a
functional group to either a primary or secondary carbon atom. We used the
imaging spectral line survey survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA and the results
of a recent spectroscopic study of propanol to search for the iso and normal
isomers of this molecule in the hot molecular core Sgr B2(N2). We expanded the
network of the astrochemical model MAGICKAL to explore the formation routes of
propanol. We report the first interstellar detection of iso-propanol toward a
position of Sgr B2(N2) that shows narrow linewidths. We also report the first
secure detection of normal-propanol in a hot core. i-Propanol is found to be
nearly as abundant as n-propanol, with an abundance ratio of 0.6 similar to the
ratio of 0.4 that we obtained previously for i- and n-propyl cyanide in Sgr
B2(N2). The results are in good agreement with the outcomes of our
astrochemical models, which indicate that OH-radical addition to propylene in
dust-grain ice mantles, driven by water photodissociation, can produce
appropriate quantities of n- and i-propanol. The n-to-i ratio in Sgr B2(N2) may
be a direct inheritance of the branching ratio of this reaction process. The
detection of n- and i-propanol and their ratio indicate that the modest
preference toward the normal form of propyl cyanide determined previously may
be a more general feature among similarly sized interstellar molecules.

are employed. Recent 2D projection-based methods, including range view and
multi-view fusion, can run in real time, but suffer from lower accuracy due to
information loss during the 2D projection. Besides, to improve the performance,
previous methods usually adopt test time augmentation (TTA), which further
slows down the inference process. To achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off,
we propose Cascade Point-Grid Fusion Network (CPGNet), which ensures both
effectiveness and efficiency mainly by the following two techniques: 1) the
novel Point-Grid (PG) fusion block extracts semantic features mainly on the 2D
projected grid for efficiency, while summarizes both 2D and 3D features on 3D
point for minimal information loss; 2) the proposed transformation consistency
loss narrows the gap between the single-time model inference and TTA. The
experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that the
CPGNet without ensemble models or TTA is comparable with the state-of-the-art
RPVNet, while it runs 4.7 times faster.

However, studies employ datasets provided by different location-based data

gap, in this study, we examined three prominent location-based data sources:
Spectus, X-Mode, and Veraset to analyze human mobility networks across
metropolitan areas at different scales: global, sub-structure, and microscopic.
Dissimilar results were obtained from the three datasets, suggesting the
sensitivity of network models and measures to datasets. This finding has
important implications for building generalized theories of human mobility and
urban dynamics based on different datasets. The findings also highlighted the
need for ground-truthed human movement datasets to serve as the benchmark for
testing the representativeness of human mobility datasets. Researchers and
decision-makers across different fields of science and technology should
recognize the sensitivity of human mobility results to dataset choice and
develop procedures for ground-truthing the selected datasets in terms of
representativeness of data points and transferability of results.

SinTra, consisting of a pyramid of Transformer-XL with a multi-scale training

for maintaining the inter-track correlation, we use the convolution operation
to process multi-track music, and when decoding, the tracks are independent to
each other to prevent interference. We evaluate SinTra with both subjective

extracting contextual features from these papers could help us to suggest the
most related paper to them. In this paper, we present a multi-task
recommendation system (RS) that predicts a paper recommendation and generates
its meta-data such as keywords. The system is implemented as a three-stage deep
neural network encoder that tries to maps longer sequences of text to an
embedding vector and learns simultaneously to predict the recommendation rate
for a particular user and the paper's keywords. The motivation behind this
approach is that the paper's topics expressed as keywords are a useful
predictor of preferences of researchers. To achieve this goal, we use a system
combination of RNNs, Highway and Convolutional Neural Networks to train
end-to-end a context-aware collaborative matrix. Our application uses Highway
networks to train the system very deep, combine the benefits of RNN and CNN to
find the most important factor and make latent representation. Highway Networks
allow us to enhance the traditional RNN and CNN pipeline by learning more
sophisticated semantic structural representations. Using this method we can
also overcome the cold start problem and learn latent features over large

computer vision. Nowadays unsupervised person re-identification methods have
achieved great progress by training with pseudo labels. However, how to purify
feature and label noise is less explicitly studied in the unsupervised manner.
To purify the feature, we take into account two types of additional features
from different local views to enrich the feature representation. The proposed
multi-view features are carefully integrated into our cluster contrast learning
to leverage more discriminative cues that the global feature easily ignored and
biased. To purify the label noise, we propose to take advantage of the
knowledge of teacher model in an offline scheme. Specifically, we first train a
teacher model from noisy pseudo labels, and then use the teacher model to guide
the learning of our student model. In our setting, the student model could
converge fast with the supervision of the teacher model thus reduce the
interference of noisy labels as the teacher model greatly suffered. After
carefully handling the noise and bias in the feature learning, our purification
modules are proven to be very effective for unsupervised person
re-identification. Extensive experiments on three popular person
re-identification datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
Especially, our approach achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy 85.8\% @mAP and
94.5\% @Rank-1 on the challenging Market-1501 benchmark with ResNet-50 under
the fully unsupervised setting. The code will be released.

convolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term
time dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also
adopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation
quality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer,
FastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any
intermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff
demonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech
samples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time
on a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech
synthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff
generalized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and
FastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech

patients in need for a replacement organ with compatible living donors. Ideally
many medical institutions should participate in a matching program to increase
the chance for successful matches. However, to fulfill legal requirements
current systems use complicated policy-based data protection mechanisms that
effectively exclude smaller medical facilities to participate. Employing secure
multi-party computation (MPC) techniques provides a technical way to satisfy
data protection requirements for highly sensitive personal health information
while simultaneously reducing the regulatory burdens.
  Results: We have designed, implemented, and benchmarked SPIKE, a secure
MPC-based privacy-preserving KEP which computes a solution by finding matching
donor-recipient pairs in a graph structure. SPIKE matches 40 pairs in cycles of
length 2 in less than 4 minutes and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
protocol by a factor of 400x in runtime while providing medically more robust
solutions.
  Conclusions: We show how to solve the KEP in a robust and privacy-preserving
manner achieving practical performance. The usage of MPC techniques fulfills
many data protection requirements on a technical level, allowing smaller health
care providers to directly participate in a kidney exchange with reduced legal

endoreversible approximation. We consider the ratio $\eta_{\text{MP}}^{(2)}$ at

$\eta_{\text{CA}}^2$, gives a good estimate of $\eta_{\text{MP}}^{(2)}$ for the

\eta_{\text{CA}}^2$. This resembles the situation where the Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency gives a good estimate of the efficiency at maximum power for various
kinds of finite-time heat engines. Taking an overdamped Brownian particle in a
harmonic potential as an example, we can realize such endoreversible small heat
engines and give an expression of the cumulants of work output and heat input.
The approximate relation $\eta_{\text{MP}}^{(2)} \simeq \eta_{\text{CA}}^2$ is
verified by numerical simulations. This relation also suggests a trade-off

sequence of positive linear operators on C[0,1] is an approximation process or
not by only testing the convergence on the functions \{1, t, t^2\} (the test
set). This result is known as the first Korovkin theorem. This outstanding
result led to a new theory called Korovkin-type Approximation Theory. In 1968,
O. Shisha and B. Mond formulated and proved a quantitative form of this
theorem. This estimation theorem gives the convergence of a sequence of
positive linear operators to the identity operator in terms of the convergence
of the test functions and a quantity called modulus of continuity. Later in
1972, Ronald A DeVore proved an extension to this theorem. T. Nishishiraho
obtained extensions of such results in various settings in the 1980's. These
quantitative versions give inequalities that cover the approximation results
and provide the convergence rate depending on the smoothness of the function.
In a recent article, Yusuf Zeren, Migdad Ismailov and Cemil Karacam proved
Korovkin-type theorems on Banach function spaces. They also derived an analogue
of the Korovkin theorem for Kantorovich polynomials. These results are
applicable in various concrete examples such as Lebesgue spaces, grand-Lebesgue
spaces, Morrey-type spaces and their weighted versions, weak Lebesgue spaces,
Orlicz spaces, etc. This article discusses the quantitative versions of these
results, in line with the classical quantitative versions by O. Shisha, B. Mond
and Ronald A DeVore. We obtained estimation theorems in terms of the modulus of
continuity for functions in C[0,1] under weaker conditions. These quantitative
forms apply to the case of Kantorovich polynomials on several spaces such as
Lebesgue spaces, Grand Lebesgue spaces, Morrey-type spaces etc. We also discuss
the special forms of the inequalities in these various examples.

misuses are common in software projects, and while there have been techniques
proposed to detect such misuses, studies have shown that they fail to reliably
detect misuses while reporting many false positives. One limitation of prior
work is the inability to reliably identify correct patterns of usage. Many
approaches confuse a usage pattern's frequency for correctness. Due to the
variety of alternative usage patterns that may be uncommon but correct, anomaly
detection-based techniques have limited success in identifying misuses. We
address these challenges and propose ALP (Actively Learned Patterns),
reformulating API misuse detection as a classification problem. After
representing programs as graphs, ALP mines discriminative subgraphs. While
still incorporating frequency information, through limited human supervision,
we reduce the reliance on the assumption relating frequency and correctness.
The principles of active learning are incorporated to shift human attention
away from the most frequent patterns. Instead, ALP samples informative and
representative examples while minimizing labeling effort. In our empirical

early Earth. Reduced phases in the impactor (e.g., metallic iron) can reduce
the planet's H$_2$O inventory to produce massive atmospheres rich in H$_2$.
Whilst previous studies have focused on the interactions between the impactor
and atmosphere in such scenarios, we investigate two further effects, 1) the
distribution of the impactor's iron inventory during impact between the target
interior, target atmosphere, and escaping the target, and 2) interactions
between the post-impact atmosphere and the impact-generated melt phase. We find
that these two effects can potentially counterbalance each other, with the
melt-atmosphere interactions acting to restore reducing power to the atmosphere
that was initially accreted by the melt phase. For a $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{kg}$
impactor, when the iron accreted by the melt phase is fully available to reduce
this melt, we find an equilibrium atmosphere with H$_2$ column density
$\sim10^4\,\mathrm{moles\,cm^{-2}}$
($p\mathrm{H2}\sim120\,\mathrm{bars}\mathrm{,}~X_\mathrm{H2}\sim0.77$),
consistent with previous estimates. However, when the iron is not available to
reduce the melt (e.g., sinking out in large diameter blobs), we find
significantly less H$_2$ ($7\times10^2-5\times10^3\,\mathrm{moles\,cm^{-2}}$,
$p\mathrm{H2}\lesssim60\,\mathrm{bars}\mathrm{,}~X_\mathrm{H2}\lesssim0.41$).
These lower H$_2$ abundances are sufficiently high that species important to
prebiotic chemistry can form (e.g., NH3, HCN), but sufficiently low that the
greenhouse heating effects associated with highly reducing atmospheres, which
are problematic to such chemistry, are suppressed. The manner in which iron is
accreted by the impact-generated melt phase is critical in determining the
reducing power of the atmosphere and re-solidified melt pool in the aftermath
of impact.

problem, where the start and endpoints of trajectory patterns within the
collected trajectory data are not known in advance. We study this problem in
the form of a set cover problem for a given polygonal curve: find the smallest
number $k$ of representative curves such that any point on the input curve is
contained in a subcurve that has Fr\'echet distance at most a given $\Delta$ to
a representative curve. We focus on the case where the representative curves
are line segments and approach this NP-hard problem with classical techniques
from the area of geometric set cover: we use a variant of the multiplicative
weights update method which was first suggested by Br\""onniman and Goodrich for
set cover instances with small VC-dimension. We obtain a
bicriteria-approximation algorithm that computes a set of $O(k\log(k))$ line
segments that cover a given polygonal curve of $n$ vertices under Fr\'echet
distance at most $O(\Delta)$. We show that the algorithm runs in
$\widetilde{O}(k^2 n + k n^3)$ time in expectation and uses $ \widetilde{O}(k n
+ n^3)$ space. For two dimensional input curves that are $c$-packed, we bound
the expected running time by $\widetilde{O}(k^2 c^2 n)$ and the space by $
\widetilde{O}(kn + c^2 n)$. In $\mathbb{R}^d$ the dependency on $n$ instead is
quadratic. In addition, we present a variant of the algorithm that uses
implicit weight updates on the candidate set and thereby achieves near-linear
running time in $n$ without any assumptions on the input curve, while keeping
the same approximation bounds. This comes at the expense of a small
(polylogarithmic) dependency on the relative arclength.

magnetic topological insulator with various topological phases such as quantum

high-temperature QAHE are not easy to realize. It is theoretically proposed
that the exchange bias can be introduced in the MnBi2Te4/ferromagnetic (FM)

easier to realize the zero-field or high-temperature QAHE. Here we report the
electrically tunable exchange bias in the van der Waals
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ heterostructure. The exchange bias emerges
over a critical magnetic field and reaches the maximum value near the magnetic

heterostructure provides a promising platform to study the novel exchange bias

graph $G$. Motifs capture higher order organizational structure of $G$ beyond
edge relationships, and, therefore, have found wide applications such as in
graph clustering, community detection, and analysis of biological and physical
networks to name a few. In these applications, the cut structure of motifs
plays a crucial role as vertices are partitioned into clusters by cuts whose
conductance is based on the number of instances of a particular motif, as
opposed to just the number of edges, crossing the cuts.
  In this paper, we introduce the concept of a motif cut sparsifier. We show
that one can compute in polynomial time a sparse weighted subgraph $G'$ with
only $\widetilde{O}(n/\epsilon^2)$ edges such that for every cut, the weighted
number of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G'$ is within a $1+\epsilon$
factor of the number of copies of $M$ crossing the cut in $G$, for every
constant size motif $M$.
  Our work carefully combines the viewpoints of both graph sparsification and
hypergraph sparsification. We sample edges which requires us to extend and
strengthen the concept of cut sparsifiers introduced in the seminal work of to
the motif setting. We adapt the importance sampling framework through the
viewpoint of hypergraph sparsification by deriving the edge sampling
probabilities from the strong connectivity values of a hypergraph whose
hyperedges represent motif instances. Finally, an iterative sparsification
primitive inspired by both viewpoints is used to reduce the number of edges in
$G$ to nearly linear.
  In addition, we present a strong lower bound ruling out a similar result for
sparsification with respect to induced occurrences of motifs.

employing a pulsed, slot jet in crossflow is investigated experimentally. A
parametric study on actuation frequencies and duty cycles is performed. The
actuator is a flush-mounted slot jet that injects fluid into a well-behaved
zero-pressure-gradient TBL over a flat plate. A heated-thin-foil sensor
measures the time-averaged convective heat transfer coefficient downstream of
the actuator location and the flow field is characterised by means of Particle
Image Velocimetry. The results show that both the jet penetration in the
streamwise direction and the overall Nusselt number increase with increasing
duty cycle. The frequency at which the Nusselt number is maximised is
independent of the duty cycle. The flow topology is considerably altered by the
jet pulsation. A wall-attached jet rises from the slot accompanied by a pair of
counter-rotating vortices that promote flow entrainment and mixing. Eventually,
a simplified model is proposed which decouples the effect of pulsation
frequency and duty cycle in the overall heat transfer enhancement, with a good
agreement with experimental data. The cost of actuation is also quantified in
terms of the amount of injected fluid during the actuation, leading to conclude
that the lowest duty cycle is the most efficient for heat transfer enhancement.

achieve robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. A natural way towards
this goal is capturing only clinically disease-related features, which is
composed of macroscopic attributes (e.g., margins, shapes) and microscopic
image-based features (e.g., textures) of lesion-related areas. However, such
disease-related features are often interweaved with data-dependent (but disease
irrelevant) biases during learning, disabling the OOD generalization. To
resolve this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Domain Invariant
Model with Graph Convolutional Network (DIM-GCN), which only exploits invariant
disease-related features from multiple domains. Specifically, we first propose
a Bayesian network, which explicitly decomposes the latent variables into
disease-related and other disease-irrelevant parts that are provable to be
disentangled from each other. Guided by this, we reformulate the objective
function based on Variational Auto-Encoder, in which the encoder in each domain
has two branches: the domain-independent and -dependent ones, which
respectively encode disease-related and -irrelevant features. To better capture
the macroscopic features, we leverage the observed clinical attributes as a
goal for reconstruction, via Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Finally, we
only implement the disease-related features for prediction. The effectiveness
and utility of our method are demonstrated by the superior OOD generalization
performance over others on mammogram benign/malignant diagnosis.

feasible to predict them. Predicting realistic children's faces may help settle
many social problems, such as age-invariant face recognition, kinship
verification, and missing child identification. It can be regarded as an
image-to-image translation task. Existing approaches usually assume domain
information in the image-to-image translation can be interpreted by ""style"",
i.e., the separation of image content and style. However, such separation is
improper for the child face prediction, because the facial contours between
children and parents are not the same. To address this issue, we propose a new
disentangled learning strategy for children's face prediction. We assume that
children's faces are determined by genetic factors (compact family features,
e.g., face contour), external factors (facial attributes irrelevant to
prediction, such as moustaches and glasses), and variety factors (individual
properties for each child). On this basis, we formulate predictions as a
mapping from parents' genetic factors to children's genetic factors, and
disentangle them from external and variety factors. In order to obtain accurate
genetic factors and perform the mapping, we propose a ChildPredictor framework.
It transfers human faces to genetic factors by encoders and back by generators.
Then, it learns the relationship between the genetic factors of parents and
children through a mapping function. To ensure the generated faces are
realistic, we collect a large Family Face Database to train ChildPredictor and
evaluate it on the FF-Database validation set. Experimental results demonstrate
that ChildPredictor is superior to other well-known image-to-image translation
methods in predicting realistic and diverse child faces. Implementation codes

corresponds to the spacial case $W_k = V_k$. The generalized QBM is more
complicated but the generalization is necessary. This is because the particle
transition and the pair production between the system and the environment
represent two very different physical processes, and usually cannot have the
same coupling strengths. Thus, the conventional QBM model, which is
well-defined at classical level, is hardly realized in real quantum physical
world. We discuss the physical realizations of the generalized QBM in different
physical systems, and derive its exact master equation for both the initial
decoupled states and initial correlated states. The Hu-Paz-Zhang master
equation of the conventional QBM model is reproduced as a special case. We find
that the renormalized Brownian particle Hamiltonian after traced out all the
environmental states induced naturally a momentum-dependent potential, which
also shows the necessity of including the momentum-dependent coupling in the
QBM Hamiltonian. In the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation, such a renormalized
potential is misplaced so that the correct renormalization Hamiltonian has not
been found. With the exact master equation for both the initial decoupled and
and initial correlated states, the issues about the initial jolt which is a
long-stand problem in the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation is also re-examined. We
find that the so-called ""initial jolt"", which has been thought to be an
artificial effect due to the use of the initial decoupled system-environment
states, has nothing do to with the initial decoupled state. The new exact
master equation for the generalized QBM also has the potential applications to

However, the retrieval of sensory data about PoIs is a real challenge because
most geographical information servers fail to provide this data. Moreover,
ad-hoc crowdsourcing campaigns do not guarantee to cover large geographical
areas and lack sustainability. Thus, we investigate the extraction of sensory
data about places from the consumer feedback collected by location-based
services, on which people spontaneously post reviews from all over the world.
Specifically, we propose a model for the extraction of sensory data from the
reviews about PoIs, and its integration in recommender systems to predict item
ratings by considering both user preferences and compatibility information. We
tested our approach with autistic and neurotypical people by integrating it
into diverse recommendation algorithms. For the test, we used a dataset built
in a crowdsourcing campaign and another one extracted from TripAdvisor reviews.
The results show that the algorithms obtain the highest accuracy and ranking
capability when using TripAdvisor data. Moreover, by jointly using these two
datasets, the algorithms further improve their performance. These results
encourage the use of consumer feedback as a reliable source of information
about places in the development of inclusive recommender systems.

buses. Dynamic interlining is an operational strategy for routes that have a
terminal station at a common hub, that allows a portion of (or all) the fleet
to be shared among the routes belonging to the hub (shared fleet) as needed.
The shared fleet is dispatched on an on-demand basis to serve scheduled trips
on any route to avoid delays and regulate services. The paper examines
systematically the impacts of dynamic interlining on service reliability. It
formulates the dispatching problem as an optimization problem and uses
simulation to evaluate the dynamic interlining strategy under a variety of
operating conditions. Using bus routes in Boston Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority (MBTA) as a case study, the feasibility of the
strategy, as well as factors that affect its performance are investigated.
Results show that dynamic interlining can improve service reliability
(increases on-time departures and decreases departure headways variability at
the hub). The fraction of the fleet that is shared has the most dominant impact
on performance. In the case where all buses are dynamically interlined, the
performance improves as route frequency increases and more routes participate
in the strategy.

such line forces currently can only be done by specialised codes in 1-D

alternative approaches. We presented a comprehensive and fast method for
computing the radiation line-force using tables of spectral line-strength
distribution parameters, which can be applied in arbitrary (multi-D,
time-dependent) simulations, including those accounting for the
line-deshadowing instability, to compute the appropriate opacities. We assumed
local thermodynamic equilibrium to compute a flux-weighted line opacity from
$>4$ million spectral lines. We derived the spectral line strength and
tabulated the corresponding line-distribution parameters for a range of input
densities $\rho\in[10^{-20},10^{-10}]gcm^{-3}$ and temperatures
$T\in[10^4,10^{4.7}]K$. We found that the variation of the line distribution
parameters plays an essential role in setting the wind dynamics in our models.
In our benchmark study, we also found a good overall agreement between the
O-star mass-loss rates of our models and those derived from steady-state
studies using more detailed radiative transfer. Our models reinforce that
self-consistent variation of the line-distribution parameters is important for
the dynamics of line-driven flows. Within a well-calibrated O-star regime, our
results support the proposed methodology. In practice, utilising the provided
tables, yielded a factor $>100$ speed-up in computational time compared to
specialised 1-D model-atmosphere codes of line-driven winds, which constitutes
an important step towards efficient multi-D simulations. We conclude that our
method and tables are ready to be exploited in various radiation-hydrodynamic

by the radiative coupling of the local dipoles in each particle. Probably the
most impressive example is bound states in the continuum (BICs), which are
electromagnetic modes with a dispersion inside the light cone but infinite
lifetime, i.e., modes that cannot leak to the continuum. Symmetry-protected
BICs appear at highly symmetric points in the dispersion of periodic systems.
Although the addition of nonequivalent lattice points in a unit cell is an easy
and straightforward way of tuning the symmetry, BICs in such particle lattice,
i.e., non-Bravais lattice, are less explored among periodic systems. Starting
from a periodic square lattice of Si nanodisks, we have prepared three
non-Bravais lattices by detuning size and position of the second disk in the
unit cell. Diffraction-induced coupling excites magnetic/electric dipoles in
each nanodisk, producing two surface lattice resonances at the $\Gamma$ point
with a band gap in between. %of $\sim$ 41 meV.
  The high/low energy branch becomes a BIC for the size/position-detuned array,
respectively, while both branches are bright (or leaky) when both size and
position are detuned simultaneously. The role of magnetic and electric
resonances in dielectric nanoparticles and the change of BIC to bright
character of the modes is explained by the two different origins of BICs in the
detuned arrays, which is further discussed with the aid of a coupled electric
and magnetic dipole model. This study gives a simple way of tuning BICs at
telecom wavelengths in non-Bravais lattices, including both plasmonic and
dielectric systems, thus scalable to a wide range of frequencies.

method, the stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) and
the damped random walk (DRW) models are used to model the long-term LCs. Our
results show that the long-term variabilities of 23 AGNs can be characterized
well by both SHO and DRW models. However, the SHO model is restricted in the
over-damped mode and the parameters are poorly constrained. The SHO power
spectral densities (PSDs) are same as the typical DRW PSD. In the plot of the
rest-frame timescale that corresponds to the broken frequency in the PSD versus
black hole mass, the intrinsic $\gamma$-ray characteristic timescales of 23
AGNs occupy almost the same space with the optical variability timescales
obtained from the accretion disk emission. This suggests a connection between
the jet and the accretion disk. Same as the optical variability of AGN
accretion disk, the $\gamma$-ray timescale is also consistent with the thermal

Our detailed experimental and theoretical polarization-resolved study reveals a

the polarization of the detected photoluminescence is governed by the symmetry
of the wurtzite 1D quantum wire subbands on the one hand, but also by the

different data samples, which ignores the inherent ""recognition difficulty""
differences between various samples. We propose to feed different data samples
with varying quantization schemes to achieve a data-dependent dynamic
inference, at a fine-grained layer level. However, enabling this adaptive
inference with changeable layer-wise quantization schemes is challenging
because the combination of bit-widths and layers is growing exponentially,
making it extremely difficult to train a single model in such a vast searching
space and use it in practice. To solve this problem, we present the Arbitrary
Bit-width Network (ABN), where the bit-widths of a single deep network can
change at runtime for different data samples, with a layer-wise granularity.
Specifically, first we build a weight-shared layer-wise quantizable
""super-network"" in which each layer can be allocated with multiple bit-widths
and thus quantized differently on demand. The super-network provides a
considerably large number of combinations of bit-widths and layers, each of
which can be used during inference without retraining or storing myriad models.
Second, based on the well-trained super-network, each layer's runtime bit-width
selection decision is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by
an adaptive inference strategy accordingly. Experiments show that the
super-network can be built without accuracy degradation, and the bit-widths
allocation of each layer can be adjusted to deal with various inputs on the
fly. On ImageNet classification, we achieve 1.1% top1 accuracy improvement

has been used for the fabrication and cast iron-based FMMCs. The main
characteristics being considered during the designing and fabrication of FMMCs
are wear resistance and improved specific mechanical properties. To fabricate
cheaper and eco-friendly FMMCs, traditionally used costly reinforcements such
as SiC, WC, TiC, SiO2, TiO2, TiB2 are required to be replaced by inexpensive
industrial wastes like red-mud, fly-ashes and grinding swarf. The data
extracted from the web of science exhibited that the FMMCs have been researched
less than the NFMMCs. The increasing number of research papers on FMMCs
indicates a bright future. FMMCs are going to be a favourite topic among
researchers and manufacturers. Higher strengths, wear resistance, dimensional
stability at elevated temperatures, and, most importantly, the lower cost will
put forward the FMMCs as a stiff competitor of NFMMCs. In developing and mass
production of FMMCs for field applications, challenges like oxidation and
higher weight still require special research efforts.

reidentification. The support pairs can provide the most informative
relationships and support the discriminative feature learning. Specifically, we
firstly design a dual uncertainty selection strategy to iteratively discover
support pairs and require human annotations. Afterwards, we introduce a
constrained clustering algorithm to propagate the relationships of labeled
support pairs to other unlabeled samples. Moreover, a hybrid learning strategy
consisting of an unsupervised contrastive loss and a supervised support pair
loss is proposed to learn the discriminative re-id feature representation. The
proposed overall framework can effectively lower the labeling cost by mining
and leveraging the critical support pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art active learning
methods on large-scale person re-id benchmarks.

the relation between ferromagnetism in bulk and in exfoliated layers. The
magnetoconductance measured on field-effect transistors and tunnel barriers
shows that the Curie temperature of exfoliated multilayers is $T_C$ = 57 K,
larger than in bulk ($T_{\rm C,bulk}$ = 50 K). Below $T \approx$ 40 K, we
observe an unusual evolution of the tunneling magnetoconductance, analogous to
the phenomenology observed in bulk. Comparing the magnetoconductance measured

determine that the orientation of the easy-axis in multilayers is similar to
that in bulk, and suggests that the in-plane component of the magnetization
points in different directions in different layers. Besides establishing that
the magnetic state of bulk and multilayers are similar, our experiments
illustrate the complementarity of magnetotransport and magneto-optical

between medical features and learn better patient health representations.
Existing methods try to estimate feature correlations only from data, or
increase the quality of estimation by introducing task-specific medical
knowledge. However, such methods either are difficult to estimate the feature
correlations due to insufficient training samples, or cannot be generalized to
other tasks due to reliance on specific knowledge. There are medical research
revealing that not all the medical features are strongly correlated. Thus, to
address the issues, we expect to group up strongly correlated features and
learn feature correlations in a group-wise manner to reduce the learning
complexity without losing generality. In this paper, we propose a general
patient health representation learning framework MedFACT. We estimate
correlations via measuring similarity between temporal patterns of medical
features with kernel methods, and cluster features with strong correlations
into groups. The feature group is further formulated as a correlation graph,
and we employ graph convolutional networks to conduct group-wise feature
interactions for better representation learning. Experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of MedFACT. The discovered medical
findings are also confirmed by literature, providing valuable medical insights

zero-shot capabilities on a wide variety of tasks. This gives rise to the
appealing vision of a single, versatile model with a wide range of
functionalities across disparate applications. However, current leading
techniques for leveraging a ""frozen"" LM -- i.e., leaving its weights untouched
-- still often underperform fine-tuning approaches which modify these weights
in a task-dependent way. Those, in turn, suffer forgetfulness and compromise
versatility, suggesting a tradeoff between performance and versatility. The
main message of this paper is that current frozen-model techniques such as
prompt tuning are only the tip of the iceberg, and more powerful methods for
leveraging frozen LMs can do just as well as fine tuning in challenging domains
without sacrificing the underlying model's versatility. To demonstrate this, we
introduce three novel methods for leveraging frozen models: input-dependent
prompt tuning, frozen readers, and recursive LMs, each of which vastly improves
on current frozen-model approaches. Indeed, some of our methods even outperform
fine-tuning approaches in domains currently dominated by the latter. The
computational cost of each method is higher than that of existing frozen model
methods, but still negligible relative to a single pass through a huge frozen
LM. Each of these methods constitutes a meaningful contribution in its own
right, but by presenting these contributions together we aim to convince the
reader of a broader message that goes beyond the details of any given method:
that frozen models have untapped potential and that fine-tuning is often
unnecessary.

pitch-shift data augmentation enables the coverage of a variety of pitch

that every edge of $G$ belongs to at most two of them; and a conjecture by
Mazzuoccolo (2013), which states that $G$ admits two perfect matchings whose

we show that given any $1^+$-factor $F$ (a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that

induced by individual ion impacts. The phenomenon has been reproduced using
atomistic simulations, although the time scale limitations and the lack of
accurate interatomic models within the metal-silica interface lead unavoidably
to severe simplifications. We improve the realism in the simulations with an

the processes in the matrix between impacts. The simulations with correct
adhesion show that the nanoparticles can grow in aspect ratio in the molten

active role of the matrix: without explicitly modeling processes in the matrix

Using a unique dataset, which enables us to study sensor resolution domain gaps

by a strong dependence on the number of LiDAR points per object, while the

mutation or fuzzing according to a predefined coverage metric to find inputs
that cause misbehavior. With the introduction of a neuron coverage metric, CGT
has also recently been applied to DNNs. In this work, we apply CGT to the task
of person detection in crowded scenes. The proposed pipeline uses YOLOv3 for
person detection and includes finding DNN bugs via sampling and mutation, and
subsequent DNN retraining on the updated training set. To be a bug, we require
a mutated image to cause a significant performance drop compared to a clean
input. In accordance with the CGT, we also consider an additional requirement
of increased coverage in the bug definition. In order to explore several types
of robustness, our approach includes natural image transformations,
corruptions, and adversarial examples generated with the Daedalus attack. The
proposed framework has uncovered several thousand cases of incorrect DNN

traditional index structures with machine learning models, has been actively
explored to reduce storage and search costs. However, accurate and efficient
similarity query processing in high-dimensional metric spaces remains to be an
open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing approach called LIMS
that uses data clustering, pivot-based data transformation techniques and
learned indexes to support efficient similarity query processing in metric
spaces. In LIMS, the underlying data is partitioned into clusters such that
each cluster follows a relatively uniform data distribution. Data
redistribution is achieved by utilizing a small number of pivots for each
cluster. Similar data are mapped into compact regions and the mapped values are
totally ordinal. Machine learning models are developed to approximate the
position of each data record on disk. Efficient algorithms are designed for
processing range queries and nearest neighbor queries based on LIMS, and for
index maintenance with dynamic updates. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of LIMS compared with
traditional indexes and state-of-the-art learned indexes.

to the High-Luminosity LHC, it is time for the international high energy
physics community to define the future of collider particle physics. The
European Strategy for Particle Physics highlights an electron-positron Higgs
boson factory as the main priority and as a first step towards a very
high-energy future hadron collider.
  A staged Future Circular Collider (FCC), consisting of a luminosity-frontier
highest-energy electron-positron collider (FCC-ee) followed by an
energy-frontier hadron collider (FCC-hh), promises the most far-reaching
physics program for the post-LHC era. FCC-ee is a precision instrument to study
the Z, W, Higgs and top particles, and offers unprecedented sensitivity to
signs of new physics. Most of the FCC-ee infrastructure can later be reused for
the subsequent hadron collider, FCC-hh.
  The FCC-hh provides proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
100 TeV and can directly produce new particles with masses of up to several
tens of TeV. This collider will also measure the Higgs self-coupling and
explore the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking. Thermal dark matter
candidates will be either discovered or conclusively ruled out by FCC-hh.
  Heavy-ion collisions and ep collisions (FCC-eh) further contribute to the
breadth of the overall FCC program. The integrated FCC infrastructure will
serve the particle physics community through the end of the 21st century.
  This presentation summarizes the feasibility of such a plan, possible
implementation and conceptual designs of FCC-ee and FCC-hh, as well as physics
potential.

  processing","1 figure",,,,"quant-ph physics.data-an stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two types of states are widely used in quantum mechanics, namely
(deterministic-coefficient) pure states and statistical mixtures. A density
operator can be associated with each of them. We here address a third type of
states, that we previously introduced in a more restricted framework. These
states generalize pure ones by replacing each of their deterministic ket
coefficients by a random variable. We therefore call them Random-Coefficient
Pure States, or RCPS. We analyze their properties and their relationships with
both types of usual states. We show that RCPS contain much richer information
than the density operator and mean of observables that we associate with them.
This occurs because the latter operator only exploits the second-order
statistics of the random state coefficients, whereas their higher-order
statistics contain additional information. That information can be accessed in
practice with the multiple-preparation procedure that we propose for RCPS, by
using second-order and higher-order statistics of associated random
probabilities of measurement outcomes. Exploiting these higher-order statistics
opens the way to a very general approach for performing advanced quantum
information processing tasks. We illustrate the relevance of this approach with
a generic example, dealing with the estimation of parameters of a quantum
process and thus related to quantum process tomography. This parameter
estimation is performed in the non-blind (i.e. supervised) or blind (i.e.
unsupervised) mode. We show that this problem cannot be solved by using only
the density operator \rho of an RCPS and the associated mean value Tr(\rho A)
of the operator A that corresponds to the considered physical quantity. We
succeed in solving this problem by exploiting a fourth-order statistical
parameter of state coefficients, in addition to second-order statistics.
Numerical tests validate this result.

scattering processes and dimension-8 operators contributing to anomalous
quartic gauge couplings~(aQGCs). Because of the cleaner final state, it is
easier to decode subprocess and certain operator couplings at a muon collider.
We attempt to identify the anomalous $WWWW$ coupling in the exclusive $WW\to
WW$ scattering in this paper. Since one aQGC can be induced by multiple
dimension-8 operators, the study of one coupling can help to confine different
operators. Meanwhile, singling out the $WW\to WW$ process can help to study the
unitarity bounds. The vector boson scattering process corresponding to the
anomalous $WWWW$ coupling is $\mu^+\mu^-\to
\nu\nu\bar{\nu}\bar{\nu}\ell^+\ell^-$, with four (anti-)neutrinos in the final
state, which brings troubles in phenomenological studies. In this paper, the
machine learning method is used to tackle this problem. We find that, using the
artificial neural network can extract the $W^+W^-\to W^+W^-$ contribution, and
is helpful to reconstruct the center of mass energy of the subprocess which is
important in the study of the Standard Model effective field theory. The
sensitivities and the expected constraints on the dimension-8 operators at the

learning. Despite their rapid development, GNNs also face some challenges, such
as over-fitting, over-smoothing, and non-robustness. Previous works indicate
that these problems can be alleviated by random dropping methods, which
integrate augmented data into models by randomly masking parts of the input.
However, some open problems of random dropping on GNNs remain to be solved.
First, it is challenging to find a universal method that are suitable for all
cases considering the divergence of different datasets and models. Second,
augmented data introduced to GNNs causes the incomplete coverage of parameters
and unstable training process. Third, there is no theoretical analysis on the
effectiveness of random dropping methods on GNNs. In this paper, we propose a
novel random dropping method called DropMessage, which performs dropping
operations directly on the propagated messages during the message-passing
process. More importantly, we find that DropMessage provides a unified
framework for most existing random dropping methods, based on which we give
theoretical analysis of their effectiveness. Furthermore, we elaborate the
superiority of DropMessage: it stabilizes the training process by reducing
sample variance; it keeps information diversity from the perspective of
information theory, enabling it become a theoretical upper bound of other
methods. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments that aims for
multiple tasks on five public datasets and two industrial datasets with various
backbone models. The experimental results show that DropMessage has the
advantages of both effectiveness and generalization, and can significantly
alleviate the problems mentioned above.

for forbidden pairs is NP-hard. However, our polynomial-time algorithm for the
case of only forced pairs can be extended to a fixed-parameter tractable
algorithm with respect to the number of forbidden pairs when both forced and

show either that our algorithmic results can be extended or that formerly

observations obtained with LIFE using its simulator LIFEsim, considering all
major astrophysical noise sources. With the nominal spectral resolution (R=50)
and signal-to-noise ratio (assumed to be S/N=10 at 11.2 $\mu$m), we can
identify the main spectral features of all the analyzed scenarios (most notably
CO$_2$, H$_2$O, O$_3$, CH$_4$). This allows us to distinguish between inhabited
and lifeless scenarios. Results suggest that particularly O$_3$ and CH$_4$
yield an improved abundance estimate by doubling the S/N from 10 to 20. We
conclude that the baseline requirements for R and S/N are sufficient for LIFE
to detect O$_3$ and CH$_4$ in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet with an
abundance of O$_2$ of around 2% in volume mixing ratio. This information is
relevant in terms of the LIFE mission planning. We also conclude that
cloud-free retrievals of cloudy planets can be used to characterize the
atmospheric composition of terrestrial habitable planets, but not the thermal
structure of the atmosphere. From the inter-model comparison performed, we
deduce that differences in the opacity tables (caused by e.g. a different line
wing treatment) may be an important source of systematic errors.

characterize the level of ionization of the circumstellar gas at small envelope
radii and investigate its relation to the efficiency of the coupling between
the star-forming gas and the magnetic field in the Class 0 protostar B335. We
have obtained molecular line emission maps of B335 with ALMA, which we use to
measure the deuteration fraction of the gas, its ionization fraction, and the
cosmic-ray ionization rate, at envelope radii $\lesssim$1000 au. We find large
fractions of ionized gas, $\chi_{e} \simeq 1-8 \times 10^{-6}$. Our
observations also reveal an enhanced ionization that increases at small
envelope radii, reaching values up to $\zeta_{CR} \simeq 10^{-14}$~s$^{-1}$ at
a few hundred au from the central protostellar object. We show that this
extreme ionization rate can be attributed to the presence of cosmic rays
accelerated close to the protostar. We report the first resolved map of the
cosmic-ray ionization rate at scales $\lesssim 1000$~au in a solar-type Class 0
protostar, finding remarkably high values. Our observations suggest that local
acceleration of cosmic rays, and not the penetration of interstellar Galactic
cosmic rays, may be responsible for the gas ionization in the inner envelope,
potentially down to disk forming scales. If confirmed, our findings imply that
protostellar disk properties may also be determined by local processes setting
the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field, and not only by the amount
of angular momentum available at large envelope scales and the magnetic field
strength in protostellar cores.

Regge trajectories we have derived the relations between slope ratios,
intercepts, and baryon masses. Using these relations, the ground state masses
of $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Xi_{bc}$, $\Omega_{cc}$, and $\Omega_{bc}$ baryons are
obtained. The values of Regge slopes and Regge intercepts are extracted for
these baryons to estimate the excited state masses in both the ($J,M^{2}$) and
($n,M^{2}$) planes. Our obtained results are compared with the experimental
observations where available and other theoretical predictions, which could be
a valuable addition to the interpretations of experimentally unknown heavy

aspect in judging their suitability for specific tasks, and ultimately, for
generating trust in them. We address the problem of finding the robustness of
individual predictions. We show both theoretically and with empirical examples
that a method based on counterfactuals that was previously proposed for this is
insufficient, as it is not a valid metric for determining the robustness
against perturbations that occur ``naturally'', outside specific adversarial
attack scenarios. We propose a flexible approach that models possible
perturbations in input data individually for each application. This is then
combined with a probabilistic approach that computes the likelihood that a
``real-world'' perturbation will change a prediction, thus giving quantitative
information of the robustness of individual predictions of the trained machine
learning model. The method does not require access to the internals of the
classifier and thus in principle works for any black-box model. It is, however,
based on Monte-Carlo sampling and thus only suited for input spaces with small
dimensions. We illustrate our approach on the Iris and the Ionosphere datasets,
on an application predicting fog at an airport, and on analytically solvable
cases.

expensive for large data sets. This paper provides a set of alternative
strategies for identifying and mitigating aliasing that are applicable even to

directly from the governing equations, can be used to detect aliasing and to
turn the ill-posed problem of removing aliasing from data into a well-posed

spatial filtering can be used to remove aliasing for convective systems. We
also propose strategies to prevent aliasing when generating a database,

non-linear Ginzburg-Landau model and large-eddy simulation (LES) data for a

such as bug detection. Lacking real bugs, most existing works construct
training and test data by injecting synthetic bugs into correct programs.
Despite achieving high test accuracy (e.g., 90%), the resulting bug detectors
are found to be surprisingly unusable in practice, i.e., <10% precision when
used to scan real software repositories. In this work, we argue that this
massive performance difference is caused by a distribution shift, i.e., a
fundamental mismatch between the real bug distribution and the synthetic bug
distribution used to train and evaluate the detectors. To address this key
challenge, we propose to train a bug detector in two phases, first on a
synthetic bug distribution to adapt the model to the bug detection domain, and
then on a real bug distribution to drive the model towards the real
distribution. During these two phases, we leverage a multi-task hierarchy,
focal loss, and contrastive learning to further boost performance. We evaluate
our approach extensively on three widely studied bug types, for which we
construct new datasets carefully designed to capture the real bug distribution.
The results demonstrate that our approach is practically effective and
successfully mitigates the distribution shift: our learned detectors are highly
performant on both our test set and the latest version of open source
repositories. Our code, datasets, and models are publicly available at

antiferromagnetism at around liquid nitrogen temperature. In this work,
polycrystalline BaFeF4 has been prepared by solid state reaction. The slight
deficiency of Fe leads to the coexistence of valence states of +2 and +3,
facilitating the electrons to hop between the neighboring Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions
through the middle F- ion, leading to the strong double exchange interaction
with weak ferromagnetism above room temperature. A bifurcation at about 170 K
between the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled temperature dependent
magnetization curves indicates the onset of 2-dimensional antiferromagnetism,
which is completed at about 125 K with the sudden drop of magnetization.
Despite the fact of type-I multiferroic, its magnetoelectricity can be
evidenced by the pyroelectric current, which shows a peak starting at about 170
K and finishing at about 125 K. The saturated ferroelectric polarization change
of around 34 {\mu}C/m2 is observed, which is switchable by the reversed poling
electric field and decreases to about 30 {\mu}C/m2 under a magnetic field of 90
kOe. This magnetoelectricity can be qualitatively reproduced by
first-principles calculations. Our results represent substantial progress to
search for high-temperature multiferroics in ferroelectric fluorides.

are sequences of time-stamped locations that mobile entities visit. To analyse
such trajectories, a crucial part is a measure of similarity between two
trajectories. We propose the time-window Frechet distance, which enforces the
maximum temporal separation between points of two trajectories that can be
paired in the calculation of the Frechet distance, and the metric-based edit
distance which incorporates the underlying metric in the computation of the
insertion and deletion costs. Using these measures, we can cluster trajectories
to infer group motion patterns. We look at the $k$-gather problem which
requires each cluster to have at least $k$ trajectories. We prove that k-gather
remains NP-hard under edit distance, metric-based edit distance and Jaccard
distance. Finally, we improve over previous results on discrete Frechet
distance and show that there is no strongly sub-quadratic time with
approximation factor less than $1.61$ in two dimensional setting unless SETH

Here, we introduce efficient measures of magic resource for pure quantum states
with a sampling cost that is independent of the number of qubits. Our method
uses Bell measurements over two copies of a state, which we implement in
experiment together with a cost-free error mitigation scheme. We show the
transition of classically simulable stabilizer states into intractable quantum

distinguish stabilizer and non-stabilizer states with low measurement cost even
in the presence of experimental noise. Further, we propose a variational
quantum algorithm to maximize our measure via the shift-rule. Our algorithm can
be free of barren plateaus even for highly expressible variational circuits.
Finally, we experimentally demonstrate a Bell measurement protocol for the

described via a time-continuous evolution through the weighting schemes. By
adapting this flow to preserve the Markovian property, its limits turn out to
be curvature sharp. Our aim is to present the flow in the most general case of
not necessarily reversible random walks allowing laziness, including vanishing
transition probabilities along some edges (""degenerate"" edges). This approach
requires to extend all concepts (in particular, the Bakry-\'Emery curvature
related notions) to this general case and it leads to a distinction between the
underlying topology (a mixed combinatorial graph) and the weighting scheme
(given by transition rates). We present various results about curvature sharp
vertices and weighted graphs as well as some fundamental properties of this new
curvature flow. This paper is accompanied by a second paper discussing the
curvature flow implementation in Python for practical use. In this second paper
we present examples and exhibit further properties of the flow.

time-averaged quantities of chaotic systems with respect to input parameters.
Such sensitivities cannot be computed by conventional adjoint analysis tools,
because the presence of positive Lyapunov exponents leads to exponential growth
of the adjoint variables. The proposed method is based on the least-square
shadowing (LSS) approach [1], that formulates the evaluation of sensitivities
as an optimisation problem, thereby avoiding the exponential growth of the
solution. However, all existing formulations of LSS (and its variants) are in
the time domain and the computational cost scales with the number of positive
Lyapunov exponents. In the present paper, we reformulate the LSS method in the
Fourier space using harmonic balancing. The new method is tested on the
Kuramoto-Sivashinski system and the results match with those obtained using the
standard time-domain formulation. Although the cost of the direct solution is
independent of the number of positive Lyapunov exponents, storage and computing
requirements grow rapidly with the size of the system. To mitigate these
requirements, we propose a resolvent-based iterative approach that needs much
less storage. Application to the Kuramoto-Sivashinski system gave accurate
results with very low computational cost. The method is applicable to large
systems and paves the way for application of the resolvent-based shadowing
approach to turbulent flows. Further work is needed to assess its performance
and scalability.

solar masses, using the time-dependent evolution of an accretion disk unstable
due to the dominant radiation pressure. We use a 1-dimensional, vertically
integrated time-dependent numerical scheme which models simultaneous evolution
of the disk and corona, coupled by the vertical mass exchange. We also discuss
the possibility of presence of an inner optically thin flow, namely the
Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). We found that the outburst character
strongly depends on the magnetic field and the outer radius of the disk if this
radius is smaller (due to TDE phenomenon) than the size of the instability zone
in a stationary disk with infinite radius. For microquasars, the dependence on
the magnetic field is monotonic, and the period decreases with the field
strength. For larger black hole masses, the dependence is non-monotonic, and
initial rise of the period is later replaced with the relatively rapid decrease
as the magnetic field continues to rise. Still stronger magnetic field
stabilizes the disk. Our computations confirm that the radiation pressure
instability model can account for heartbeat states in microquasars. Rapid
variability detected in IMBH in the form of Quasi-Periodic Ejection can be
consistent with the model but only if combined with TDE phenomenon. Yearly
repeating variability in Changing Look AGN also requires, in our model, small

on identifying and fully exploiting the deterministic information in WSOD. We
discover that negative instances (i.e. absolutely wrong instances), ignored in

deterministic information (NDI) based method for improving WSOD, namely
NDI-WSOD. Specifically, our method consists of two stages: NDI collecting and

and distill the NDI from negative instances online. In the exploiting stage, we
utilize the extracted NDI to construct a novel negative contrastive learning
mechanism and a negative guided instance selection strategy for dealing with
the issues of part domination and missing instances, respectively. Experimental

physical and chemical phenomena, impacting the quantification of biodiversity,
measured by diversity indexes such as Shannon's entropy. Then, once a point
estimate is obtained, confidence intervals methods such as the bootstrap ones
are often used. These methods, however, can have different performances, which
many authors have revealed in the last decade. Furthermore, problems such as
the asymmetry of the distribution of estimates and the possibility of Shannon's
diversity index estimator bias can lead to incorrect recommendations to the
research community. Thus, we propose two methods and compare them with seven
others using their performances to face these problems. The first idea uses the
credible interval (CI) method to build a bootstrap confidence interval. The
second one starts by correcting the bias and then uses an asymptotic approach.
We considered 27 community structures representing scenarios with high
dominance, high codominance or moderate dominance, the number of species equal
to 4, 20 or 80 and 10, 50 or 500 individuals to compare their performances.
Then, we generated 1000 samples, built 95% confidence intervals, and calculated
the percentage of times they included the community diversity index (coverage
percentage) for each community structure. Our results showed the feasibility of
both proposed methods to estimate Shannon's diversity. The simulation study
revealed the bootstrap-t technique had the best performance, i.e., best
coverage percentage, compared with the other methods. Finally, we illustrate
the methodology by applying it to an original aphid and parasitoid species
dataset. We recommend the bootstrap-t when the community structure analysed is
similar to the simulated ones. Also, the methods provided high performance for
the high dominance scenarios.

field of research in the development of new optoelectronics and photonic
applications over the last decade. Organic-inorganic layered perovskites are
currently some of the most promising 2D van der Waals materials, due to their
exceptional optical brightness and enhanced excitonic effects. However, low
crystal quality and spectral diffusion usually broaden the exciton linewidth,
obscuring the fine structure of the exciton in conventional photoluminescence
experiments. Here, we propose a mechanical approach for reducing the effect of
spectral diffusion by means of hBN-capping on layered perovskites with
different thicknesses, revealing the exciton fine structure. We used a
stochastic model to link the reduction of the spectral linewidth with the
population of active charge fluctuation centres present in the organic spacer
taking part in the dynamical Stark shift. Active fluctuation centres are
reduced by a factor of 3.7 to 7.1 when we include hBN-capping according to our
direct spectral measurements. This rate is in good agreement with the analysis
of the overlap between the squared perovskite lattice and the hexagonal hBN
lattice. Van der Waals forces between both lattices cause the partial clamping
of the perovskite organic spacer molecules, and hence, the amplitude of the
dynamical Stark shift characteristic of the spectral diffusion effect is
reduced. Our work provides an easy and low-cost solution to the problem of
accessing important fine-structure excitonic state information, along with an
explanation of the important carrier dynamics present in the organic spacer
that affect the quality of the optical emission.

learning algorithm. The second level consists of a decision-making system that
can trigger an alarm based on this health indicator. Three degrees of
refinements are compared in the first level of the framework, from simple
threshold-based univariate predictive technique to supervised learning methods
based on the remaining time before failure. We choose to use the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and its variations as the common algorithm used in all the
formulations. We apply and compare the different strategies on a real-world

  Heterogeneous Trade Graph",,,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the booming growth of e-commerce, detecting financial fraud has become
an urgent task to avoid transaction risks. Despite the successful applications
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in fraud detection, the existing solutions are
only suitable for a narrow scope due to the limitation in data collection.
Especially when expanding a business into new territory, e.g., new cities or
new countries, developing a totally new model will bring the cost issue and
result in forgetting previous knowledge. Moreover, recent works strive to
devise GNNs to expose the implicit interactions behind financial transactions.
However, most existing GNNs-based solutions concentrate on either homogeneous
graphs or decomposing heterogeneous interactions into several homogeneous
connections for convenience. To this end, this study proposes a novel solution
based on heterogeneous trade graphs, namely HTG-CFD, to prevent knowledge
forgetting of cross-regional fraud detection. In particular, the heterogeneous
trade graph (HTG) is meticulously constructed from original transaction records
to explore the complex semantics among different types of entities and
relationships. And motivated by recent continual learning, we present a
practical and task-oriented forgetting prevention method to alleviate knowledge
forgetting in the context of cross-regional detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed HTG-CFD not only promotes the performance in
cross-regional scenarios but also significantly contributes to single-regional
fraud detection.

biggest remaining source of uncertainty when daily IGRT or adaptation is used,
it has not been accounted for quantitatively in treatment planning. Using
probabilistic planning allows to directly account for contouring uncertainties
in plan optimisation. The first step is to create an algorithm that can
generate many realistic contours with variation matching actual inter-observer
variation.
  We propose a methodology to generate random contours, based on measured
spatial inter-observer variation, IOV, and a single parameter that controls its
geometrical dependency: alpha, the width of the 3D Gaussian used as point
spread function (PSF). We used a level set formulation of the median shape,
with the level set function defined as the signed distance transform. To create
a new contour, we added the median level set and a noise map which was weighted
with the IOV map and then convolved with the PSF. Thresholding the level set
function reconstructs the newly generated contour.
  We used data from 18 patients from the golden atlas, consisting of five
prostate delineations on T2-w MRI scans. To evaluate the similarity between the
contours, we calculated the maximum distance to agreement to the median shape
(maxDTA), and the minimum dose of the contours using an ideal dose
distribution. We used the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the
distributions for maxDTA and minDose between the generated and manually
delineated contours.
  Only alpha=0.75cm produced maxDTA and minDose distributions that were not
significantly different from the manually delineated structures. Accounting for
the PSF is essential to correctly simulate inter-observer variation.

two major challenges in HSI classification: interclass similarity and
intraclass variability. Many advanced deep learning methods have attempted to
address these issues from the perspective of a region/patch-based approach,
instead of a pixel-based alternate. However, the patch-based approaches
hypothesize that neighborhood pixels of a target pixel in a fixed spatial
window belong to the same class. And this assumption is not always true. To
address this problem, we herein propose a new deep learning architecture,
namely Gramian Angular Field encoded Neighborhood Attention U-Net (GAF-NAU),
for pixel-based HSI classification. The proposed method does not require
regions or patches centered around a raw target pixel to perform 2D-CNN based
classification, instead, our approach transforms 1D pixel vector in HSI into 2D
angular feature space using Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and then embed it to a
new neighborhood attention network to suppress irrelevant angular feature while
emphasizing on pertinent features useful for HSI classification task.
Evaluation results on three publicly available HSI datasets demonstrate the

designed for operating efficiently in such context [1][2], where static and
mobile IoT devices are enriched with ICN functions. Specifically, MobCCN
leverages an efficient routing and forwarding protocol, exploiting
opportunistic contacts among IoT mobile devices, to fill the Forwarding

the intended data producers. In this paper, we aim to enhance the reliability
of MobCCN by exploring different retransmissions mechanisms, such as
retransmissions based on number of duplicate Interests that are received for
the same requested content, periodic retransmissions, single path versus
disjoint multi-path forwarding, hysteresis mechanism and combinations of them.
Extensive simulation results show that, among the analysed MobCCN variants, the
one that implements both periodic retransmissions and a hysteresis-based
retransmission process ensures the highest delivery rates (up to 95\%) and the
shortest network path, with a very limited traffic overhead due to
retransmissions.

this study is the first to introduce a flexible visual working memory model in
video decomposition tasks to provide interpretable and high-performance
hierarchical deep architecture, integrating the transformative representations
between sensory and control layers from the perspective of visual and cognitive
neuroscience. Specifically, robust PCA unrolling networks acting as a
structure-regularized sensor layer decompose XCA into sparse/low-rank
structured representations to separate moving contrast-filled vessels from
noisy and complex backgrounds. Then, patch recurrent convolutional LSTM
networks with a backprojection module embody unstructured random
representations of the control layer in working memory, recurrently projecting
spatiotemporally decomposed nonlocal patches into orthogonal subspaces for
heterogeneous vessel retrieval and interference suppression. This video
decomposition deep architecture effectively restores the heterogeneous profiles
of intensity and the geometries of moving objects against the complex

Then I describe a theory of elastic turbulence and prediction of elastic waves

Alfven waves in magneto-hydrodynamics and in in a contrast to all other fluid
flows with wave speed depending on medium elasticity. Since the established and
testified mechanism of elastic instability of viscoelastic flows with
curvilinear streamlines becomes ineffective at zero curvature, so parallel
shear flows are proved linearly stable, similar to Newtonian parallel shear
flows. However, the linear stability of parallel shear flows does not imply
their global stability. Here I switch to the main subject, namely a recent
development in inertia-less parallel shear channel flow of polymer solutions.
In such flow, we discover an elastically driven instability, elastic
turbulence, elastic waves, and drag reduction down to relaminarization that
contradicts the linear stability prediction. In this regard, I discuss shortly
normal versus non-normal bifurcations in such flows, flow resistance, velocity
and pressure fluctuations, and spatial and spectral velocity as a function of

stage, participants, etc. This paper reports an industrial case study that aims
to investigate the experiences and lessons from this software practice. To this
end, we collected and analyzed various empirical evidence for data
triangulation. The results reflect that retro-inspection distinguishes itself
from peer code review by identifying more complicated and underlying defects,
providing more indicative and suggestive comments. Many experienced inspectors
indicate defects together with their rationale behind and offer suggestions for
correction and prevention. As a result, retro-inspection can benefit not only
quality assurance (like Fagan inspection), but also internal audit,
inter-division communication, and competence promotion. On the other side, we
identify several lessons of retro-inspection at this stage, e.g., developers'
acceptance and organizers' predicament, for next-step improvement of this

retro-inspection, e.g., more adequate preparation and more careful publicity.
This study concludes that most of the expected benefits of retro-inspection can
be empirically confirmed in this enterprise and its value on the progress to
continuous maturity can be recognized organization-wide. The experiences on

related ambient solar wind in the ecliptic and meridional plane are different.
Therefore, one can expect that the orientation of the flux-rope axis of a
coronal mass ejection (CME) influences the propagation of the CME itself.
However, the determination of the CME orientation, especially from image data,
remains a challenging task to perform. This study aims to provide a reference
to different CME orientation determination methods in the near-Sun environment.
Also, it aims to investigate the non-radial flow in the sheath region of the
interplanetary CME (ICME) in order to provide the first proxy to relate the
ICME orientation with its propagation. We investigated 22 isolated CME-ICME
events in the period 2008-2015. We determined the CME orientation in the
near-Sun environment using the following: 1) a 3D reconstruction of the CME
with the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model applied to coronagraphic
images provided by the STEREO and SOHO missions and; 2) an ellipse fitting
applied to single spacecraft data from SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs. In
the near-Earth environment, we obtained the orientation of the corresponding
ICME using in situ plasma and field data and also investigated the non-radial
flow (NRF) in its sheath region. The ability of GCS and ellipse fitting to
determine the CME orientation is found to be limited to reliably distinguish
only between the high or low inclination of the events. Most of the CME-ICME
pairs under investigation were found to be characterized by a low inclination.
For the majority of CME-ICME pairs, we obtain consistent estimations of the
tilt from remote and in situ data. The observed NRFs in the sheath region show
a greater y direction to z direction flow ratio for high-inclination events,
indicating that the CME orientation could have an impact on the CME
propagation.

(bones) from the outside (skin). This has many applications in medicine and
biomechanics. Existing state-of-the-art biomechanical skeletons are detailed
but do not easily generalize to new subjects. Additionally, computer vision and
graphics methods that predict skeletons are typically heuristic, not learned
from data, do not leverage the full 3D body surface, and are not validated
against ground truth. To our knowledge, our system, called OSSO (Obtaining
Skeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from the 3D
body surface to the internal skeleton from real data. We do so using 1000 male
and 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To these, we fit
a parametric 3D body shape model (STAR) to capture the body surface and a novel
part-based 3D skeleton model to capture the bones. This provides inside/outside
training pairs. We model the statistical variation of full skeletons using PCA
in a pose-normalized space. We then train a regressor from body shape
parameters to skeleton shape parameters and refine the skeleton to satisfy
constraints on physical plausibility. Given an arbitrary 3D body shape and
pose, OSSO predicts a realistic skeleton inside. In contrast to previous work,
we evaluate the accuracy of the skeleton shape quantitatively on held-out DXA
scans, outperforming the state-of-the-art. We also show 3D skeleton prediction
from varied and challenging 3D bodies. The code to infer a skeleton from a body

stable way with respect to noise in the data. A typical approach to enforce
uniqueness and select a meaningful solution is to introduce a regularizer.
While for most applications the regularizer is convex, in many cases it is not
smooth nor strongly convex. In this paper, we propose and study two new
iterative regularization methods, based on a primal-dual algorithm, to solve
inverse problems efficiently. Our analysis, in the noise free case, provides
convergence rates for the Lagrangian and the feasibility gap. In the noisy
case, it provides stability bounds and early-stopping rules with theoretical
guarantees. The main novelty of our work is the exploitation of some a priori
knowledge about the solution set, i.e. redundant information. More precisely we
show that the linear systems can be used more than once along the iteration.
Despite the simplicity of the idea, we show that this procedure brings
surprising advantages in the numerical applications. We discuss various
approaches to take advantage of redundant information, that are at the same
time consistent with our assumptions and flexible in the implementation.
Finally, we illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations for
robust sparse recovery and image reconstruction through total variation. We
confirm the efficiency of the proposed procedures, comparing the results with

density functional theory (DFT), including time-dependent (TD-)DFT in both its
linear-response and its explicitly time-dependent formulations. As applied to
the Kohn-Sham DFT ground state, linear-response theory affords an
eigenvalue-type problem for the excitation energies in a basis of
singly-excited Slater determinants, and is widely known simply as ""TDDFT""
despite its frequency-domain formulation. This form of TDDFT is the mostly
widely-used quantum-chemical method for excited states, due to a favorable
combination of low cost and reasonable accuracy. The chapter surveys the
accuracy of linear-response TDDFT, which is generally more sensitive to the
details of the exchange-correlation functional as compared to ground-state DFT,
and also describes some known systemic problems exhibited by this approach.
Some of those problems can be corrected on a case-by-case basis using
orbital-optimized, excited-state self-consistent field (SCF) calculations, in
what is known as excited-state Kohn-Sham theory or a ""Delta-SCF"" procedure, a
class of methods that includes restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham theory. Recent
successes of these approaches are highlighted, including double excitations and
core-level excitations. Finally, explicitly time-dependent (or ""real-time"")
TDDFT involves propagation of the molecular orbitals in time following an
external perturbation, according to the Kohn-Sham analogue of the
time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The time-dependent approach has been used
to model strong-field electron dynamics, and in the weak-field limit it
provides a route to broadband spectra based on the time evolution of the dipole
moment function. This is useful for describing high-energy excitations (as in
x-ray spectroscopy) and in systems where the density of states is high, as
demonstrated by a few examples.

characterised by a single parameter $\mathcal{K}$, allows for the existence of
bound states located between the effective vortex core and the angular momentum
barrier. The existence of these bound states leads to an enhanced absorption
when the frequency of the incoming wave matches bound state frequencies, which
result in Breit-Wigner type spectral lines in the absorption spectra. We also
investigate the case of rotating analogue ECOs. In this scenario, some of the
bound states undergo superradiant amplification and become unstable. In both

transmission/reflection spectra exhibiting the enhanced

celebrated Markov Chain Monte Carlo method using a simple model of population
dynamics as our motivation and focusing on a few elementary distributions.
Conceptually, the population flow between cities closely resembles the random
walk of a single walker in a state space. We start from two states, then three
states, and finally the setup is fully generalized to many states of both
discrete and continuous distributions. Despite the mathematical simplicity, the
setup remarkably includes all the essential concepts of Markov Chain Monte
Carlo without loss of generality, e.g., ergodicity, global balance and detailed
balance, proposal or selection probability, acceptance probability, up to the
underlying stochastic matrix, and error analysis. Our teaching experience
suggests that most senior undergraduate students in physics can closely follow
these materials without much difficulty.

understood by dividing this concept into two different types of probability,
namely physical probability and analogical probability. Loosely speaking, a
physical probability is a probability that applies to the outcomes of an
experiment that have been judged as being equally likely on the basis of
physical symmetry. Physical probabilities are arguably in some sense
'objective' and possess all the standard properties of the concept of
probability. On the other hand, an analogical probability is defined by making
an analogy between the uncertainty surrounding an event of interest and the
uncertainty surrounding an event that has a physical probability. Analogical
probabilities are undeniably subjective probabilities and are not obliged to
have all the standard mathematical properties possessed by physical
probabilities, e.g. they may not have the property of additivity or obey the
standard definition of conditional probability. Nevertheless, analogical
probabilities have extra properties, which are not possessed by physical
probabilities, that assist in their direct elicitation, general derivation,
comparison and justification. More specifically, these properties facilitate
the application of analogical probability to real-world problems that can not
be adequately resolved by using only physical probability, e.g. probabilistic
inference about hypotheses on the basis of observed data. Careful definitions
are given of the concepts that are introduced and, where appropriate, examples

Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) can identify TCFA and assess

developed an automated method that can detect lipidous plaque and assess
fibrous cap thickness in IVOCT images. This study analyzed a total of 4,360

performance, preprocessing included lumen segmentation, pixel-shifting, and
noise filtering on the raw polar (r, theta) IVOCT images. We used the
DeepLab-v3 plus deep learning model to classify lipidous plaque pixels. After
lipid detection, we automatically detected the outer border of the fibrous cap
using a special dynamic programming algorithm and assessed the cap thickness.
Our method provided excellent discriminability of lipid plaque with a
sensitivity of 85.8% and A-line Dice coefficient of 0.837. By comparing lipid
angle measurements between two analysts following editing of our automated
software, we found good agreement by Bland-Altman analysis (difference 6.7+/-17

analysis (4.2+/-14.6 micron; mean 175 micron), indicating little bias between
users and good reproducibility of the measurement. We developed a fully

simply connected $C^{1,\alpha}$ domain $\Omega$. After extending the linearised
problem for $L^2(\Omega)$ perturbations, we orthogonally decompose $L^2(\Omega)
= \oplus_{k=0}^\infty \mathcal{H}_k$ and prove Lipschitz stability on each of
the infinite-dimensional $\mathcal{H}_k$ subspaces. In particular,
$\mathcal{H}_0$ is the space of square-integrable harmonic perturbations. This
appears to be the first Lipschitz stability result for infinite-dimensional
spaces of perturbations in the context of the (linearised) Calder\'on problem.
Previous optimal estimates with respect to the operator norm of the data map
have been of the logarithmic-type in infinite-dimensional settings. The
remarkable improvement is enabled by using the Hilbert-Schmidt norm for the
Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary map and its Fr\'echet derivative with respect to
the conductivity coefficient. We also derive a direct reconstruction method
that inductively yields the orthogonal projections of a general $L^2(\Omega)$
perturbation onto the $\mathcal{H}_k$ spaces. If the perturbation is in the
subspace $\oplus_{k=0}^K \mathcal{H}_k$, then the reconstruction method only
requires data corresponding to $2K+2$ specific Neumann boundary values.

machines can also elicit greater self-disclosure by signaling to the users that
they are being heard, which can have positive outcomes. However, it takes
considerable engineering effort and training to embed active listening skills
in machines at scale, given the need to personalize active-listening cues to
individual users and their specific utterances. A more generic solution is
needed given the increasing use of conversational agents, especially by the
growing number of socially isolated individuals. With this in mind, we
developed an Amazon Alexa skill that provides privacy-preserving and
pseudo-random backchanneling to indicate active listening. User study (N = 40)
data show that backchanneling improves perceived degree of active listening by
smart speakers. It also results in more emotional disclosure, with participants
using more positive words. Perception of smart speakers as active listeners is
positively associated with perceived emotional support. Interview data
corroborate the feasibility of using smart speakers to provide emotional
support. These findings have important implications for smart speaker
interaction design in several domains of cooperative work and social computing.

neural network architectures and training pipelines that can capture the
relevant features from the input image. These features are then aggregated to
make accurate heatmap predictions from which the final keypoints of human body
parts can be inferred. Many papers in literature use CNN-based architectures
for the backbone, and/or combine it with a transformer, after which the
features are aggregated to make the final keypoint predictions [1]. In this

combine CNN and multi-head self attention (MHSA) layers effectively, and we
integrate it with a Transformer encoder and apply it to the task of 2D human
pose estimation. We consider different backbone architectures and pre-train
them using the DINO self-supervised learning method [3], this pre-training is
found to improve the overall prediction accuracy. We call our model BTranspose,

p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV measured over a
wide pseudorapidity range (${-3.5 <\eta <5}$), using ALICE at the Large Hadron

function of the centrality of the collisions, while results from pp collisions
are reported for inelastic events with at least one charged particle at
midrapidity. The charged-particle pseudorapidity densities are, under simple

This allows for the calculation and the presentation of the evolution of the
width of the rapidity distributions and of a lower bound on the Bjorken energy
density, as a function of the number of participants in all three collision
systems. We find a decreasing width of the particle production, and roughly a
ten fold increase in the energy density, as the system size grows.

image analysis results, the software includes several important algorithmic
steps: pre-processing, deep learning plaque segmentation, machine learning
identification of stent struts, and registration of pullbacks. Interactive
visualization and manual editing of segmentations were included in the
software. Quantifications include stent deployment characteristics (e.g., stent
strut malapposition), strut level analysis, calcium angle, and calcium
thickness measurements. Interactive visualizations include (x,y) anatomical, en
face, and longitudinal views with optional overlays. Underlying plaque
segmentation algorithm yielded excellent pixel-wise results (86.2% sensitivity
and 0.781 F1 score). Using OCTOPUS on 34 new pullbacks, we determined that
following automated segmentation, only 13% and 23% of frames needed any manual
touch up for detailed lumen and calcification labeling, respectively. Only up
to 3.8% of plaque pixels were modified, leading to an average editing time of
only 7.5 seconds/frame, an approximately 80% reduction compared to manual
analysis. Regarding stent analysis, sensitivity and precision were both greater
than 90%, and each strut was successfully classified as either covered or
uncovered with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). We introduced and
evaluated the clinical application of a highly automated software package,
OCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque and stent analysis in IVOCT images. The
software is currently used as an offline tool for research purposes; however,
the software's embedded algorithms may also be useful for real-time treatment

\ldots, o_k\}$. Note that each of them may have embedded or equal edges. An
edge is called containment minimal (or just minimal, for short) if it is not a
strict superset of another edge. Yet, equal minimal edges may exist. By
duality,
  (i) $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ for every pair $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B \in

  (ii) if $A$ is minimal then for every $o \in A$ there exists a $B \in

  We will extend claim (ii) as follows. A linear order $\succ$ over $O$ defines
a unique lexicographic order $\succ_L$ over the $2^O$.
  Let $A$ be a lexicographically maximal (lexmax) edge of $\mathcal{A}$. Then,
  (iii) $A$ is minimal and for every $o \in A$ there exists a minimal $B \in

  This property has important applications in game theory implying
Nash-solvability of tight game forms as shown in the old (1975 and 1989) work
of the first author. Here we give a new, very short, proof of (iii).
  Edges $A$ and $B$ mentioned in (iii) can be found out in polynomial time.
This is trivial if $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are given explicitly. Yet,
it is true even if only $\mathcal{A}$ is given, and not explicitly, but by a
polynomial containment oracle, which for a subset $O_A \subseteq O$ answers in
polynomial time whether $O_A$ contains an edge of $\mathcal{A}$.

is based on the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which provides a means of
determining spatiotemporal modes from measurements alone. DMD models are easily
updated as new data is recorded and do not require any physics to inform the
dynamics. However, in the case of ionospheric profiles, we find a wide range of
oscillations, including some far above the diurnal frequency. Therefore, we
propose nontrivial extensions to DMD using wavelet decompositions. We call this
method the Scale-Separated Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SSDMD) since the
wavelets isolate fluctuations at different time scales in the data into
separated components. We show that this method provides a stable reconstruction
of the peak plasma density and can be used to predict the state of foF2 and

score for an automatic metric using the full test set instead of the subset of

demonstrate how this small change leads to more precise estimates of
system-level correlations. Second, we propose to calculate correlations only on
pairs of systems that are separated by small differences in automatic scores
which are commonly observed in practice. This allows us to demonstrate that our
best estimate of the correlation of ROUGE to human judgments is near 0 in
realistic scenarios. The results from the analyses point to the need to collect
more high-quality human judgments and to improve automatic metrics when
differences in system scores are small.

phenomenon, we focus on a class of scalar-tensor theories, well motivated by
high energy theories of dark energy and dark matter, where the scalar is
conformally and disformally coupled to matter during the early cosmological
evolution. For a conformally dominated epoch, the PGW spectrum has a flat
step-like shape. More interestingly, a disformally dominated epoch is
characterised by a peaked spectrum with a broken power-law profile, with slopes
depending on the scalar-tensor theory considered. We introduce a graphical

role in route planning and preventing congestion on highways. These methods
utilize data collected from traffic recording stations at different timestamps

storage, and extraction techniques can have a significant impact on the
performance of the traffic flow model. On the other hand, a comprehensive
database can provide the opportunity for using complex, yet reliable predictive
models such as deep learning methods. However, most of these methods have
difficulties in handling missing values and outliers. This study focuses on
hybrid deep neural networks to predict traffic flow in the California Freeway
Performance Measurement System (PeMS) with missing values. The proposed
networks are based on a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to
consider the temporal dependencies in the data recorded in each station and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to take the spatial correlations in the
adjacent stations into account. Various architecture configurations with series
and parallel connections are considered based on RNNs and CNNs, and several
prevalent data imputation techniques are used to examine the robustness of the
hybrid networks to missing values. A comprehensive analysis performed on two
different datasets from PeMS indicates that the proposed series-parallel hybrid
network with the mean imputation technique achieves the lowest error in
predicting the traffic flow and is robust to missing values up until 21%
missing ratio in both complete and incomplete training data scenarios when
applied to an incomplete test data.

treatment gives testable predictions for the nucleonic generalized
polarizabilities -- fundamental quantities describing the nucleon's response to
an external field. We have measured the proton's generalized spin
polarizabilities in the region where $\chi$PT is expected to be valid. Our
results include the first ever data for the transverse-longitudinal spin
polarizability $\delta_{LT}$, and also extend the coverage of the
polarizability $\bar{d_2}$ to very low $Q^2$ for the first time. These results
were extracted from moments of the structure function $g_2$, a quantity which
characterizes the internal spin structure of the proton. Our experiment ran at
Jefferson Lab using a polarized electron beam and a polarized solid ammonia

quantity for $\chi$PT to reproduce, despite its reduced sensitivity to higher
resonance contributions; recent competing calculations still disagree with each
other and also diverge from the measured neutron data at very low $Q^2$. Our
proton results provide discriminating power between existing calculations, and
will help provide a better understanding of this strong QCD regime.

{\deg}C eliminates the formation of inversion domains and leads to improved
dopant activation efficiency. Extended defects in the form of inversion domains
contain electrically inactive Mg after post-implantation annealing at
temperatures as high as 1300 {\deg}C (one GPa N2 overpressure), which results
in a low dopant activation efficiency. Triple axis X-ray data show that the
implant-induced strain is fully relieved after annealing at 1300 {\deg}C for 10
min, indicating that the strain-inducing point defects formed during
implantation have reconfigured. However, annealing at temperatures of 1400
{\deg}C to 1500 {\deg}C (also one GPa N2 overpressure) eliminates the presence
of the inversion domains. Annealing at these higher temperatures and for a
longer time does not have any further impact on the strain state. While
residual defects, such as dislocation loops, still exist after annealing at and
above 1400 {\deg}C, chemical analysis at the dislocation loops shows no sign of
Mg segregation. Meanwhile, an overall decreasing trend in the dislocation loop
size and density is observed after annealing at higher temperatures and longer
times. Earlier work [1] addressing electrical measurements of these types of
samples showed that annealing at 1400 {\deg}C leads to a dopant activation
efficiency that is an order of magnitude higher than that observed at 1300
{\deg}C. This work complements the earlier work by identifying the microscopic
defects (inversion domains) which incorporate Mg, and points to the benefits,
in terms of defect density and p-type dopant activation, of using higher
temperatures annealing cycles to activate Mg in GaN.

AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with speech sound disorders
(SSD). The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated the requirement for automated speech
therapy tools for persons with SSD making speech therapy accessible and
affordable. However, there are no guidelines for designing such automated tools
and their required degree of automation compared to human experts. In this
systematic review, we followed the PRISMA framework to address four research
questions: 1) what types of SSD do AI-based automated speech therapy tools
address, 2) what is the level of autonomy achieved by such tools, 3) what are
the different modes of intervention, and 4) how effective are such tools in
comparison with human experts. An extensive search was conducted on digital
libraries to find research papers relevant to our study from 2007 to 2022. The
results show that AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD
are increasingly gaining attention among researchers. Articulation disorders
were the most frequently addressed SSD based on the reviewed papers. Further,
our analysis shows that most researchers proposed fully automated tools without
considering the role of other stakeholders. Our review indicates that
mobile-based and gamified applications were the most frequent mode of
intervention. The results further show that only a few studies compared the
effectiveness of such tools compared to expert Speech-Language Pathologists
(SLP). Our paper presents the state-of-the-art in the field, contributes
significant insights based on the research questions, and provides suggestions
for future research directions.

while many prior authors have provided such guidance, no established consensus
exists, and the extant literature has not been examined for implied consensus
and sources of disagreement. Here we present the results of a systematic review
of published normative recommendations regarding the use of population
categories, particularly in genetics research. Following PRISMA guidelines, we
extracted recommendations from n=121 articles matching inclusion criteria.
Articles were published consistently throughout the time period examined and in
a broad range of journals, demonstrating an ongoing and interdisciplinary
perceived need for guidance. Examined recommendations fall under one of eight
themes identified during analysis. Seven are characterized by broad agreement
across articles; one, Appropriate definitions of population categories and
contexts for use, revealed substantial fundamental disagreement among articles.
While many articles focus on the inappropriate use of race, none fundamentally
problematize ancestry. This work can be a resource to researchers looking for
normative guidance on the use of population descriptors, and can orient authors

Protein design, known as the inverse of protein structure prediction, aims to

Recent works on computational protein design have studied designing sequences
for the desired backbone structure with local positional information and
achieved competitive performance. However, similar local environments in
different backbone structures may result in different amino acids, indicating
that protein structure's global context matters. Thus, we propose the
Global-Context Aware generative de novo protein design method (GCA), consisting

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GCA method outperforms

this study, inherent true noise information from 2-NEX acquisition was used to
develop a deep-learning model based on residual learning of convolutional

is quantified using total, lane-changing and lane-keeping errors and associated
receiver operating characteristic curves. The benchmark analysis includes

late-time accelerating universe. A multiple scalar inflaton field is assumed to
have a conformal coupling to the Ricci scalar curvature in the lagrantian,
which results in, after a Weyl rescaling to the Einstein metric frame,
modification of inflaton kinetic and potential terms along with its coupling to
Higgs fields in the standard model. One may define an effective cosmological
$\Lambda$ function in the Einstein metric frame, which controls, when the
potential is added, a slow-roll inflation and subsequent oscillation at the
potential minimum of a spontaneous symmetry breaking phase. The inflaton
oscillation accompanies particle production towards thermalized hot big-bang
universe. At the same time zero-point quantum fluctuation of second inflaton

restoration, pushing back the inflaton field towards the infinity. This gives a

symmetric matrix, and we prove a ``Ihara-Bass'' type formula for it.
  We use this theory to prove new results on polynomial-time strong refutations
of random constraint satisfaction problems with $k$ variables per constraints
(k-CSPs). For a random k-CSP instance constructed out of a constraint that is
satisfied by a $p$ fraction of assignments, if the instance contains $n$
variables and $n^{k/2} / \epsilon^2$ constraints, we can efficiently compute a
certificate that the optimum satisfies at most a $p+O_k(\epsilon)$ fraction of
constraints.
  Previously, this was known for even $k$, but for odd $k$ one needed $n^{k/2}
(\log n)^{O(1)} / \epsilon^2$ random constraints to achieve the same
conclusion.
  Although the improvement is only polylogarithmic, it overcomes a significant
barrier to these types of results. Strong refutation results based on current
approaches construct a certificate that a certain matrix associated to the
k-CSP instance is quasirandom. Such certificate can come from a Feige-Ofek type
argument, from an application of Grothendieck's inequality, or from a spectral
bound obtained with a trace argument. The first two approaches require a union
bound that cannot work when the number of constraints is $o(n^{\lceil k/2

$o(n^{k/2} \sqrt{\log n})$.
  We further apply our techniques to obtain a new PTAS finding assignments for

vacuum friction on an intrinsically dissipative particle. The friction arises
not only from the field fluctuations but also from the dipole fluctuations
intrinsic to the particle. As a result, the dissipative particle can be out of
the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), where it loses or gains internal
energy. Only if the temperature of the particle equals a special NESS
temperature will the particle be in NESS. We first derive the NESS conditions
which give the NESS temperature of the particle as a function of the radiation
temperature and the velocity of the particle. Imposing the NESS conditions, we
then obtain an expression for the quantum vacuum friction in NESS. The NESS
quantum vacuum friction is shown to be always negative definite, therefore a
true drag. The NESS temperature and quantum vacuum friction are calculated
numerically for various models. Out of NESS, even though the quantum vacuum
frictional force no longer has a definite sign in the rest frame of the
radiation, we find the external force needed to keep the particle moving must
be in the same direction as the motion of the particle. This then excludes the
possibility of making a perpetual motion machine, which could convert the
vacuum energy into useful mechanical work. In addition, we find that the
deviation of the temperature of the particle from its NESS temperature causes
the particle to lose or gain internal energy in such a way that the particle
would return to NESS after deviating from it. This enables experimental
measurements of the NESS temperature of the particle to serve as a feasible
signature for these quantum vacuum frictional effects.

unrealistic assumption commonly used in the literature is that the truth values
of these propositions are accurately known. In real situations, however, these
truth values are uncertain since they come from sensors that suffer from
imperfections. At the same time, reward machines can be difficult to model

the propositions' truth values. In order to address such uncertainties, the
algorithm maintains a probabilistic estimate about the truth value of the

the algorithm maintains a hypothesis reward machine, which acts as an estimate

many challenges. Many different feature extraction methods exist and are widely
used. However, extracting features from millions of protein sequences becomes
impractical because they are not scalable with current algorithms. Therefore,
there is a need for an efficient feature extraction approach that extracts
significant features. We have proposed two scalable feature extraction
approaches for extracting features from huge protein sequences using Apache
Spark, which are termed 60d-SPF (60-dimensional Scalable Protein Feature) and
6d-SCPSF (6-dimensional Scalable Co-occurrence-based Probability-Specific
Feature). The proposed 60d-SPF and 6d-SCPSF approaches capture the statistical
properties of amino acids to create a fixed-length numeric feature vector that
represents each protein sequence in terms of 60-dimensional and 6-dimensional
features, respectively. The preprocessed huge protein sequences are used as an
input in two clustering algorithms, i.e., Scalable Random Sampling with
Iterative Optimization Fuzzy c-Means (SRSIO-FCM) and Scalable Literal Fuzzy
C-Means (SLFCM) for clustering. We have conducted extensive experiments on
various soybean protein datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed feature extraction methods, 60d-SPF, 6d-SCPSF, and existing feature
extraction methods on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms. The reported
results in terms of the Silhouette index and the Davies-Bouldin index show that
the proposed 60d-SPF extraction method on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering
algorithms achieves significantly better results than the proposed 6d-SCPSF and
existing feature extraction approaches.

the performance estimation component adhering to NAS is often prohibitively

of efforts have been dedicated to alleviating this pain point, no consensus has

We implemented the proposed approach by using a graph neural network for link
prediction and acquired the knowledge from NAS-Bench-101. Compared to existing

signals reveal the underlying neurophysiological activities of the brain and
muscle. Our approach first randomly masks out a portion of the input signal and
then predicts the missing information from either spatiotemporal or the Fourier
domain. Pre-trained models can be potentially used for downstream tasks such as
sleep stage classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and gesture
recognition using electromyography (EMG) signals. Unlike contrastive-based

has booming applications in both science and engineering fields, critical
mysteries about its foundations remain unsolved. Fundamental yet difficult
questions concern how information transfer and causal relation originate, what
they depend on, how they differ from each other, and if they are created by a
unified and general quantity. These questions essentially determine the
validity of causal relation measurement via information transfer. Here we
pursue to lay a complete theoretical basis of information transfer and causal
relation. Beyond the well-known relations between these concepts that
conditionally hold, we demonstrate that information transfer and causal
relation universally originate from specific information synergy and redundancy
phenomena characterized by high-order mutual information. More importantly, our
theory analytically explains the mechanisms for information transfer and causal
relation to originate, vanish, and differ from each other. Moreover, our theory
naturally defines the effect sizes of information transfer and causal relation
based on high-dimensional coupling events. These results may provide a unified
view of information, synergy, and causal relation to bridge Pearl's causal
inference theory in computer science and information transfer analysis in

partitioning during the magma ocean stage following planet formation and the
subsequent cycling between the surface and mantle over Earth history using
argon (Ar) and N isotopes as tracers. The partitioning model, constrained by
Ar, shows that only about 10% of the total N content can be trapped in the
solidified mantle due to N's low solubility in magma and low partitioning
coefficients in minerals in oxidized conditions supported from geophysical and
geochemical studies. A possible solution for the primordial origin is that
Earth had about 10 times more N at the time of magma ocean solidification. We
show that the excess N could be removed by impact erosion during late
accretion. The cycling model, constrained by N isotopes, shows that mantle N
can originate from efficient N subduction, if the sedimentary N burial rate on
early Earth is comparable to that of modern Earth. Such a high N burial rate
requires biotic processing. Finally, our model provides a methodology to
distinguish the two possible origins with future analysis of the surface and

permeability of deformation bands in the damage zone of faults. Deformation
bands are relatively small, low permeability features that can have a
significant effect on flow dynamics, however, the discrepancy of scales is a
challenge for field-scale simulation. A new analytical upscaling model is
proposed in order to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional

improved estimate of effective permeability compared to conventional upscaling
