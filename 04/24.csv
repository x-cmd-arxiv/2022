an electron in a Coulomb field, obtained in the approximation of the smallness
of the electron coupling with the radiation field, has been known for a long
time. However, in astrophysics, the classical approach, which does not
explicitly use this smallness, is sometimes used to describe similar processes
in systems of magnetic monopoles or self-interacting dark matter particles. The
importance of such problems is determined by the fact that recombination
processes play a crucial role in the evolution of the large-scale structure of
the Universe. Therefore, of particular interest is the fact that the classical
and quantum expressions for the recombination cross section differ
significantly in magnitude. It is shown that the applicability of quantum and
classical approaches to radiative recombination is closely related to the
radiated angular momentum and its quantization. For situations where the
classical approach is not suitable, a semi-classical approach based on the
angular momentum quantization is proposed, in some respects an alternative to
the well-known semi-classical Kramers' approach.

Since many networks have severe degree heterogeneity, the ordinary spectral

SCORE alleviates the effect of degree heterogeneity by introducing a new
normalization idea in the spectral domain and makes OSC more effective. SCORE
is easy to use and computationally fast. It adapts easily to new directions and
sees an increasing interest in practice. In this paper, we review the basics of
SCORE, the adaption of SCORE to network mixed membership estimation and topic
modeling, and the application of SCORE in real data, including two datasets on
the publications of statisticians. We also review the theoretical 'ideology'
underlying SCORE. We show that in the spectral domain, SCORE converts a
simplicial cone to a simplex, and provides a simple and direct link between the
simplex and network memberships. SCORE attains an exponential rate and a sharp
phase transition in community detection, and achieves optimal rates in mixed
membership estimation and topic modeling.

venerable concepts of heat, work and entropy production for individual
stochastic trajectories of mesoscopic systems. Remarkably, this approach,
relying on stochastic equations of motion, introduces time into the description
of thermodynamic processes -- which opens the way to fine control them. As a
result, the field of finite-time thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems has
blossomed. In this article, after introducing a few concepts of control for
isolated mechanical systems evolving according to deterministic equations of
motion, we review the different strategies that have been developed to realize
finite-time state-to-state transformations in both over and underdamped
regimes, by the proper design of time-dependent control parameters/driving. The
systems under study are stochastic, epitomized by a Brownian object immersed in
a fluid; they are thus strongly coupled to their environment playing the role
of a reservoir. Interestingly, a few of those methods (inverse engineering,
counterdiabatic driving, fast-forward) are directly inspired by their
counterpart in quantum control. The review also analyzes the control through
reservoir engineering. Besides the reachability of a given target state from a
known initial state, the question of the optimal path is discussed. Optimality
is here defined with respect to a cost function, a subject intimately related
to the field of information thermodynamics and the question of speed limit.
Another natural extension discussed deals with the connection between arbitrary
states or non-equilibrium steady states. This field of control in stochastic
thermodynamics enjoys a wealth of applications, ranging from optimal mesoscopic
heat engines to population control in biological systems.

future time point based on the learning from previous time points. To keep the
problem tractable, learning methods use data from a fixed length window in the
past as an explicit input. In this paper, we study how the performance of
predictive models change as a function of different look-back window sizes and
different amounts of time to predict into the future. We also consider the
performance of the recent attention-based Transformer models, which has had
good success in the image processing and natural language processing domains.
In all, we compare four different deep learning methods (RNN, LSTM, GRU, and
Transformer) along with a baseline method. The dataset (hourly) we used is the
Beijing Air Quality Dataset from the UCI website, which includes a multivariate
time series of many factors measured on an hourly basis for a period of 5 years
(2010-14). For each model, we also report on the relationship between the
performance and the look-back window sizes and the number of predicted time
points into the future. Our experiments suggest that Transformer models have
the best performance with the lowest Mean Average Errors (MAE = 14.599, 23.273)
and Root Mean Square Errors (RSME = 23.573, 38.131) for most of our single-step
and multi-steps predictions. The best size for the look-back window to predict
1 hour into the future appears to be one day, while 2 or 4 days perform the
best to predict 3 hours into the future.

  Sim-to-Real Adaptation","Accepted by 2022ICRA",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-robot shared control, which integrates the advantages of both humans
and robots, is an effective approach to facilitate efficient surgical
operation. Learning from demonstration (LfD) techniques can be used to automate
some of the surgical subtasks for the construction of the shared control
framework. However, a sufficient amount of data is required for the robot to
learn the manoeuvres. Using a surgical simulator to collect data is a less
resource-demanding approach. With sim-to-real adaptation, the manoeuvres
learned from a simulator can be transferred to a physical robot. To this end,
we propose a sim-to-real adaptation method to construct a human-robot shared
control framework for robotic surgery.
  In this paper, a desired trajectory is generated from a simulator using LfD
method, while dynamic motion primitives (DMPs) based method is used to transfer
the desired trajectory from the simulator to the physical robotic platform.
Moreover, a role adaptation mechanism is developed such that the robot can
adjust its role according to the surgical operation contexts predicted by a
neural network model. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated
on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Results of the user studies indicated that
with the adaptive human-robot shared control framework, the path length of the
remote controller, the total clutching number and the task completion time can
be reduced significantly. The proposed method outperformed the traditional
manual control via teleoperation.

Furthermore, one can also calculate the Sylvester matrices of the first and the
second kind. Thus, by means of a few strings, one can calculate the resultant
of two polynomials as well as the discriminant of a binary form. Some new
matrix functions are also added. So, today the list of matrix functions
includes the transpose, adjugate, conjugate, inverse, generalized inverse, and
pseudo inverse of a matrix, the matrix determinant, the kernel, the echelon

LSU decomposition, which is an exact block recursive LU decomposition, the QR
block recursive decomposition, and the singular value decomposition. In
addition, two block-recursive functions have been implemented for calculating
the Cholesky decomposition of symmetric positive-definite matrices: one
function for sparse matrices with the standard multiplication algorithm and
another function for dense matrices with multiplication according to the

constants. Recent controversy on the existence (versus non-existence) of
variability in the observation of decay rate can be settled by considering
mixing in decay configuration. Purpose: Variability in decay rate was
investigated based on the available information of beta decay rate data, solar
neutrino flux, and energy distribution. Method: Full systematic analysis of the
oscillatory behavior was carried out. Based on the zero threshold energy for
neutrino absorption in beta emitters, a model for configuration mixing between
two distinct beta disintegration modes $\beta^\nu$-disintegration (electron
from neutrino interaction) and the $\beta^-$-disintegration (electron from
natural decay) was proposed. Results: The phenomenon of variability in beta
decay rate was related to the possible exothermic neutrino absorption by
unstable nuclei which, in principle, should include the whole range of flux
energies involving flux with energy below the $^{71}$Ga threshold at 0.23 MeV.
These two disintegration modes occur independently and model for their apparent
mixing rate was proposed. Conclusions: The configuration mixing between the two
modes causes depletion of radioactive nuclei which is subject to change with
seasonal solar neutrino variability. Ability to detect this variability was
found to be dependent on the Q-value of the $\beta^\nu$ disintegration and
detection instrument setup. Value of neutrino cross section weighted by the
ratio between $\beta^\nu$ and $\beta^-$ detection efficiencies was found to be
in the range $10^{-44}$ to $10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$. For experiments that uses the
end point to determine the neutrino mass, interference due to mixing should be
taken into account.

Unfortunately, despite recent intensive interest and research, existing methods

show that, for many subfamilies of canonical pipelines, computing Shapley value
is in PTIME, contrasting the exponential complexity of computing Shapley value
in general. We then put this to practice -- given an sklearn pipeline, we
approximate it with a canonical pipeline to use as a proxy. We conduct

results show that DataScope is up to four orders of magnitude faster over

compact state vectors or goal images from the same robot scene. The former is
hard to interpret for non-experts and necessitates detailed state estimation

high-fidelity models must be simulated. Various deep-learning-based surrogate
modeling techniques have been developed to reduce the simulation costs
associated with these applications. However, to construct data-driven surrogate
models, several thousand high-fidelity simulation runs may be required to
provide training samples, and these computations can make training
prohibitively expensive. To address this issue, in this work we present a
framework where most of the training simulations are performed on coarsened
geomodels. These models are constructed using a flow-based upscaling method.
The framework entails the use of a transfer-learning procedure, incorporated
within an existing recurrent residual U-Net architecture, in which network
training is accomplished in three steps. In the first step. where the bulk of
the training is performed, only low-fidelity simulation results are used. The
second and third steps, in which the output layer is trained and the overall
network is fine-tuned, require a relatively small number of high-fidelity
simulations. Here we use 2500 low-fidelity runs and 200 high-fidelity runs,
which leads to about a 90% reduction in training simulation costs. The method
is applied for two-phase subsurface flow in 3D channelized systems, with flow
driven by wells. The surrogate model trained with multifidelity data is shown
to be nearly as accurate as a reference surrogate trained with only
high-fidelity data in predicting dynamic pressure and saturation fields in new
geomodels. Importantly, the network provides results that are significantly
more accurate than the low-fidelity simulations used for most of the training.
The multifidelity surrogate is also applied for history matching using an
ensemble-based procedure, where accuracy relative to reference results is again
demonstrated.

As a first illustration, we analyze a selection of string quartets by Haydn,
Mozart and Beethoven and discuss possible implications of our results in terms
of different approaches by these composers to stylistic exploration and

by Mozart, while Beethoven is the most innovative, expanding and modifying the

stochastic equations of motion, and their corresponding Janssen--De~Dominicis

well-separated from the statics, at least to one-loop order in a perturbative
treatment with respect to the static and dynamical nonlinearities. Since the
static nonlinear sigma model must be analyzed in a dimensional $d = 2 +
\varepsilon$ expansion about its lower critical dimension $d_\textrm{lc} = 2$,
whereas the dynamical mode-coupling terms are governed by the upper critical
dimension $d_c = 4$, a simultaneous perturbative dimensional expansion is not
feasible, and the reversible critical dynamics for this model cannot be
accessed at the static critical renormalization group fixed point. However, in
the coexistence limit addressing the long-wavelength properties of the
low-temperature ordered phase, we can perform an $\epsilon = 4 - d$ expansion

be fully included in the quantum time evolution of the total system. We perform
numerical simulations of projective measurements of the polarization, with the
spins prepared initially in a neutral pure state. The likewise pure initial
state of the environment is constructed as a product of coherent states of the
boson modes with a random distribution of their centroids around the origin of
phase space. Switching the self-energy of the spin and the coupling to the heat
bath on and off by a time-dependent modulation, we observe the outcome of the

the heat bath, the spins get entangled with it and lose coherence, thus
reproduce the ""collapse of the wavefunction"". The expected quantum randomness
in the final state is manifest in our simulations as a tendency of the spin to
approach either one of the two eigenstates of the measured spin operator,
recovering an almost pure state. The unitary time evolution allows us to
reproducibly relate these random final states to the respective initial states
of the environment and to monitor the exchange of information between the two
subsystems in terms of their purity and mutual entropy.

online learning algorithm against an adaptive adversary. We study restrictions
on the adversary that enable efficient minimization of the \emph{complete
policy regret}, which is the strongest possible version of policy regret. We
identify a gap in the current theoretical understanding of what sorts of
restrictions permit tractability in this challenging setting. To resolve this
gap, we consider a generalization of the stochastic multi armed bandit, which
we call the \emph{tallying bandit}. This is an online learning setting with an
$m$-memory bounded adversary, where the average loss for playing an action is
an unknown function of the number (or tally) of times that the action was
played in the last $m$ timesteps. For tallying bandit problems with $K$ actions
and time horizon $T$, we provide an algorithm that w.h.p achieves a complete
policy regret guarantee of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(mK\sqrt{T})$, where the
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ notation hides only logarithmic factors. We additionally
prove an $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m K T})$ lower bound on the expected complete
policy regret of any tallying bandit algorithm, demonstrating the near
optimality of our method.

current few-shot benchmarks use perfectly class-balanced tasks at inference. We
argue that such an artificial regularity is unrealistic, as it assumes that the
marginal label probability of the testing samples is known and fixed to the
uniform distribution. In fact, in realistic scenarios, the unlabeled query sets
come with arbitrary and unknown label marginals. We introduce and study the
effect of arbitrary class distributions within the query sets of few-shot tasks
at inference, removing the class-balance artefact. Specifically, we model the
marginal probabilities of the classes as Dirichlet-distributed random
variables, which yields a principled and realistic sampling within the simplex.
This leverages the current few-shot benchmarks, building testing tasks with
arbitrary class distributions. We evaluate experimentally state-of-the-art
transductive methods over 3 widely used data sets, and observe, surprisingly,
substantial performance drops, even below inductive methods in some cases.
Furthermore, we propose a generalization of the mutual-information loss, based

mapping from a point in the Euclidean space to the mass probability measure at

the decay of correlation functions of trimers along open chains, as well as the
average two-magnon distribution. The ground state is ferrimagnetic for $0<J\leq
1$, and is a singlet for $-1\leq J<0$. In the singlet phase, the spin
correlation functions along the legs present an antiferromagnetic power-law
decay, similar to the spin-1/2 linear chain, thus suggesting that the ground

unclear how smart contract developers approach security. To help fill this
research gap, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study consisting of a
semi-structured interview and a code review task with 29 smart contract
developers with diverse backgrounds, including 10 early stage (less than one
year of experience) and 19 experienced (2-5 years of experience) smart contract
developers.
  Our findings show a wide range of smart contract security perceptions and
practices including various tools and resources they used. Our early-stage
developer participants had a much lower success rate (15%) of identifying
security vulnerabilities in the code review task than their experienced
counterparts (55%). Our hierarchical task analysis of their code reviews
implies that just by accessing standard documentation, reference
implementations and security tools is not sufficient. Many developers checked
those materials or used a security tool but still failed to identify the
security issues. In addition, several participants pointed out shortcomings of
current smart contract security tooling such as its usability. We discuss how
future education and tools could better support developers in ensuring smart
contract security.

about the research patterns and trends, research impacts, and network topology
of the statistics community. In this paper we focus on (i) using the citation
relationships to estimate the research interests of authors, and (ii) using the
coauthor relationships to study the network topology.
  Using co-citation networks we constructed, we discover a ""statistics

propose new approaches to constructing the ""research map"" of statisticians, as
well as the ""research trajectory"" for a given author to visualize his/her
research interest evolvement. Using co-authorship networks we constructed, we
discover a multi-layer community tree and produce a Sankey diagram to visualize
the author migrations in different sub-areas. We also propose several new
metrics for research diversity of individual authors.
  We find that ""Bayes"", ""Biostatistics"", and ""Nonparametric"" are three primary
areas in statistics. We also identify 15 sub-areas, each of which can be viewed
as a weighted average of the primary areas, and identify several underlying
reasons for the formation of co-authorship communities. We also find that the
research interests of statisticians have evolved significantly in the 41-year

The positive frequencies of all the phonon modes indicate the mechanical
stability of the compound. The specific heat at constant volume and Helmholtz
free energy are calculated under harmonic approximation, while calculation of
thermal expansion is done under quasi-harmonic approximation. Lattice thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_{L}$) is calculated using first-principle anharmonic
lattice dynamics calculations. The zero-point energy and Debye temperature are
computed as $\sim$21 kJ/mol and 638 K, respectively. The calculated thermal
expansions are found to be $\sim$6.3 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$ and $\sim$7.2

deviation between calculated ($\sim$48.6 W/m-K) and experimental ($\sim$22.8
W/m-K) values of $\kappa_{L}$ are observed at 300 K. But, as the temperature
increases, the calculated and experimental $\kappa_{L}$ come closer with the
corresponding values of $\sim$18.2 W/m-K and $\sim$11.0 W/m-K at 800. The
possible reasons for the deviation of $\kappa_{L}$ are addressed. The
temperature dependent of phonon lifetime is computed in order to understand the

study time series that contain strong coupling between their events. We firstly
propose how compared to normal densities, our target time series seem to be
associated with a higher number of rare events, and Gaussian statistics tend to
underestimate these events' frequency drastically. To this end, we suggest that
by imposing Gaussian densities to the natural processes, one will seriously
neglect the existence of extreme events in many circumstances. The central
question of our study concerns the consideration of the effects of these rare
events in the corresponding probability densities and studying their role from
the point of view of quantum measurements. To model the non-Gaussian behavior
of these time-series, we utilize the multifractal random walk (MRW) approach
and control the non-Gaussianity parameter $\lambda$ accordingly. Using the
framework of quantum mechanics, we then examine the role of $\lambda$ in
quantum potentials derived for these time series. Our Bohmian quantum analysis
shows that the derived potential takes some negative values in high frequencies
(its mean values), then substantially increases, and the value drops again for
the rare events. We thus conclude that these events could generate a potential
barrier that the system, lingering in a non-Gaussian high-frequency region,
encounters, and their role becomes more prominent when it comes to transversing
this barrier. In this study, as an example of the application of quantum
potential outside of the micro-world, we compute the quantum potentials for the
S\&P financial market time series to verify the presence of rare events in the
non-Gaussian densities for this real data and remark the deviation from the
Gaussian case.

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and inelastic neutron

measurements suggested that the collinear antiferromagnetism persists to
$x=0.8$, with similar N\'{e}el temperature $T_N$ and structural transition
temperature $T_s$ around 32 K, but the charge carriers change from electron
type to hole type around $x=$ 0.5. In this study, we have found that the
in-plane resistivity anisotropy also highly depends on the Cr dopings and the
type of charge carriers. While ARPES measurements suggest possibly weak orbital
anisotropy onset near $T_s$ for both $x=0.05$ and $x=0.5$ compounds, INS
experiments reveal clearly different onset temperatures of low-energy spin
excitation anisotropy, which is likely related to the energy scale of spin
nematicity. These results suggest that the interplay between the local spins on
Fe atoms and the itinerant electrons on Fermi surfaces is crucial to the
nematic fluctuations of iron pnictides, where the orbital degree of freedom may
behave differently from the spin degree of freedom, and the transport
properties are intimately related to the spin dynamics.

relative entropy maximization (REM) and conditional entropy minimization (CEM)
to control data generation, where REM is designed to enhance the diversity of

EPiDA can support efficient and continuous data generation for effective
classifier training. Extensive experiments show that EPiDA outperforms existing

themselves are not always observed, in which case we can only bound the
propensity, and therefore bound the magnitude of causal effects. In many
important cases, like administering a dose of some medicine, the possible
treatments belong to a continuum. Sensitivity models, which are required to tie
the true propensity to something that can be estimated, have been explored for
binary treatments. We propose one for continuous treatments. We develop a
framework to compute ignorance intervals on the partially identified

autonomous driving technology under the guidance of deep learning artificial

combining the model-streamlined recognition algorithm, the depth estimation
algorithm with information fusion, and deploying them on the Jetson-Nano for
unmanned vehicles with monocular vision sensors. We use ROS for experiment. The
method proposed in this paper is suitable for mobile platforms with high
real-time request. Innovation of our method is using information fusion to
compensate the problem of insufficient frame rate of output image, and improve
the robustness of target detection and depth estimation under monocular
vision.Object Detection is based on YOLO-v5. We have simplified the network
structure of its DarkNet53 and realized a prediction speed up to 0.01s. Depth
Estimation is based on the VNL Depth Estimation, which considers multiple
geometric constraints in 3D global space. It calculates the loss function by
calculating the deviation of the virtual normal vector VN and the label, which
can obtain deeper depth information. We use PnP fusion algorithm to solve the
problem of insufficient frame rate of depth map output. It solves the motion
estimation depth from three-dimensional target to two-dimensional point based
on corner feature matching, which is faster than VNL calculation. We
interpolate VNL output and PnP output to achieve information fusion.
Experiments show that this can effectively eliminate the jitter of depth
information and improve robustness. At the control end, this method combines
the results of target detection and depth estimation to calculate the target
position, and uses a pure tracking control algorithm to track it.

language models (PLMs) like BERT contain matching subnetworks that have similar
transfer learning performance as the original PLM. These subnetworks are found
using magnitude-based pruning. In this paper, we find that the BERT subnetworks
have even more potential than these studies have shown. Firstly, we discover
that the success of magnitude pruning can be attributed to the preserved
pre-training performance, which correlates with the downstream transferability.
Inspired by this, we propose to directly optimize the subnetwork structure
towards the pre-training objectives, which can better preserve the pre-training
performance. Specifically, we train binary masks over model weights on the
pre-training tasks, with the aim of preserving the universal transferability of
the subnetwork, which is agnostic to any specific downstream tasks. We then
fine-tune the subnetworks on the GLUE benchmark and the SQuAD dataset. The
results show that, compared with magnitude pruning, mask training can
effectively find BERT subnetworks with improved overall performance on
downstream tasks. Moreover, our method is also more efficient in searching
subnetworks and more advantageous when fine-tuning within a certain range of
data scarcity. Our code is available at https://github.com/llyx97/TAMT.

reconstruct the flow field in large-scale numerically simulated wind farms by
large-eddy simulations (LES). Different wind farm layouts are considered, and
we find that a combination of horizontal and vertical staggering leads to
improved wind farm performance compared to traditional horizontal staggering.
We analyze the wind farm flows using the amplitude selection (AP) and
sparsity-promoting (SP method) DMD approach. We find that the AP method tends
to select modes with a small length scale and a high frequency, while the SP
method selects large coherent structures with low frequency. The latter are
somewhat reminiscent of modes obtained using proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD). We find that a relatively limited number of SP-DMD modes is sufficient
to accurately reconstruct the flow field in the entire wind farm, whereas the
AP-DMD method requires more modes to achieve an accurate reconstruction. Thus,
the SP-DMD method has a smaller performance loss compared to the AP-DMD method
in terms of the reconstruction of the flow field.

dynamical system, i.e. numerical approximations whose energy decreases, just
like in the original differential equation. With this aim, a discrete gradient
method is implemented for numerical integration of a system of ordinary
differential equations. In principle, this procedure yields first order
methods, but the analysis paves the way to the design of higher-order methods.
As a case in point, the proposed method is applied to the Duffing equation
without external forcing, considering that in this case, preserving the
Lyapunov function is more important than accuracy of particular trajectories.
Results are validated by means of numerical experiments, where the discrete
gradient method is compared to standard Runge-Kutta methods. As predicted by
the theory, discrete gradient methods preserve the Lyapunov function, whereas
conventional methods fail to do so, since either periodic solutions appear or
the energy does not decrease. Besides, the discrete gradient method outperforms
conventional schemes when these do preserve the Lyapunov function, in terms of
computational cost, thus the proposed method is promising.

outstanding challenge to such characterization is the mathematical complexity
that their evaluation possesses. A method to quantify quantum computational
complexity is to use a class of functions called magic monotones, which are,
however, notoriously hard and impractical to evaluate. In this work, we provide
a new perspective on calculating magic monotones by connecting them to the
concept of information scrambling. Specifically, we establish a connection
between information scrambling in random quantum circuits and the magic these
circuits generate. This connection allows us to establish a novel,
experimentally scalable way to approximate magic monotones in an arbitrary
Hilbert space dimension and therefore evaluate the amount of quantum resources
using out-of-time-order correlator measurements. Furthermore, we exploit our
result connecting scrambling and magic to formulate a simple criterion to
determine chaoticity of a given Hamiltonian.

significant metallic bonding. Study of thermophysical properties, namely, Debye
temperature, Gr\""uneisen parameter, acoustic parameters, melting temperature,
heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, and dominant phonon mode is also
indicative of soft nature of SrSi2. The electronic band structure calculations
without and with spin-orbit coupling disclose semimetallic character with clear
Weyl nodes close to the Fermi level. The electronic dispersion is anisotropic
characterized by nearly flat and linear regions within the Brillouin zone.
Optical parameters at different photon energies are investigated. SrSi2 shows
excellent nonselective reflection spectrum across an extended range of energy
encompassing the visible region implying that the compound under study has
significant potential to be used as an efficient solar energy reflector. SrSi2
absorbs ultraviolet light quite efficiently. The compound also possesses high

enrich and expand the content of the conversation. Recently, many approaches
based on external knowledge are proposed to generate rich semantic and
information conversation. Two types of knowledge have been studied for
knowledge-aware open-domain dialogue generation: structured triples from
knowledge graphs and unstructured texts from documents. To take both advantages
of abundant unstructured latent knowledge in the documents and the information
expansion capabilities of the structured knowledge graph, this paper presents a
new dialogue generation model, Dynamic Multi-form Knowledge Fusion based
Open-domain Chatt-ing Machine (DMKCM).In particular, DMKCM applies an indexed
text (a virtual Knowledge Base) to locate relevant documents as 1st hop and
then expands the content of the dialogue and its 1st hop using a commonsense
knowledge graph to get apposite triples as 2nd hop. To merge these two forms of
knowledge into the dialogue effectively, we design a dynamic virtual knowledge
selector and a controller that help to enrich and expand knowledge space.
Moreover, DMKCM adopts a novel dynamic knowledge memory module that effectively
uses historical reasoning knowledge to generate better responses. Experimental
results indicate the effectiveness of our method in terms of dialogue coherence
and informativeness.

proposed for next-generation cellular networks. Compared to the
state-of-the-art, where the total bandwidth is used for integrated sensing and
communication (ISaC), the proposed Semi-ISaC framework provides more freedom as
it allows that a portion of the bandwidth is exclusively used for either
wireless communication or radar detection, while the rest is for ISaC
transmission. To enhance the bandwidth efficiency (BE), we investigate the
evolution of Semi-ISaC networks from orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). First, we evaluate the performance of an
OMA-based Semi-ISaC network. As for the communication signals, we investigate
both the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic rate. As for the radar echoes,
we characterize the ergodic radar estimation information rate (REIR). Then, we
investigate the performance of a NOMA-based Semi-ISaC network, including the OP
and the ergodic rate for communication signals and the ergodic REIR for radar
echoes. The diversity gains of OP and the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
slopes of the ergodic REIR are also evaluated as insights. The analytical
results indicate that: 1) Under a two-user NOMA-based Semi-ISaC scenario, the
diversity order of the near-user is equal to the coefficient of the Nakagami-m
fading channels (m), while that of the far-user is zero; and 2) The high-SNR
slope for the ergodic REIR is based on the ratio of the radar signal's duty
cycle to the pulse duration. Our simulation results show that: 1) Semi-ISaC has
better channel capacity than the conventional ISaC; and 2) The NOMA-based
Semi-ISaC has better channel capacity than the OMA-based Semi-ISaC.

feasible but not necessarily optimal schedules. We propose a mixed-integer
linear optimization model to determine the optimal gas flow directions while
scheduling the system. This unlocks additional flexibility to power systems,
provided that a tight coordination between power and gas systems exists. The
increased flexibility, although it comes at the cost of increased computational
complexity, is quantified by comparing the total operational cost of the entire
system with bidirectional gas flows as opposed to unidirectional gas flows. We
numerically show that modeling gas flow directions as state variables may bring
added value not only in the meshed but also in the radial gas networks.

  Fix a Dedekind domain $\mathcal{O}$ and a non-zero prime $\mathfrak{p}$ in it
along with a uniformizer $\pi$. In the first part of the paper, we construct
$m$-shifted $\pi$-typical Witt vectors $W_{mn}(B)$ for any $\mathcal{O}$
algebra $B$ of length $m+n+1$. They are a generalization of the usual
$\pi$-typical Witt vectors. Along with it we construct a lift of Frobenius,
called the lateral Frobenius $\tilde{F}: W_{mn}(B) \rightarrow W_{m(n-1)}(B)$
and show that it satisfies a natural identity with the usual Frobenius map. Now
given a group scheme $G$ defined over $\mathrm{Spec}~ R$, where $R$ is an
$\mathcal{O}$-algebra with a fixed $\pi$-derivation $\delta$ on it, one
naturally considers the $n$-th arithmetic jet space $J^nG$ whose points are the
Witt ring valued points of $G$. This leads to a natural projection map of group
schemes $u: J^{m+n}G \rightarrow J^mG$. Let $N^{mn}G$ denote the kernel of $u$.
  One of our main results imply that for any $\pi$-formal group scheme
$\hat{G}$ over $\mathrm{Spf}~ R$, $N^{mn}\hat{G}$ is isomorphic to
$J^{n-1}(N^{m1}G)$. As an application, if $\hat{G}$ is a smooth commutative
$\pi$-formal group scheme of dimension $d$ and $R$ is of characteristic 0 whose
ramification is bounded above by $p-2$, then our result implies that $J^nG$ is
a canonical extension of $\hat{G}$ by $(\mathbb{W}_{n-1})^d$ where
$\mathbb{W}_{n-1}$ is the $\pi$-formal group scheme $\hat{\mathbb{A}}^n$
endowed with the group law of addition of Witt vectors. Our results also give a
geometric characterization of $G(\pi^{n+1}R)$ which is the subgroup of points
of $G(R)$ that reduces to identity under the modulo $\pi^{n+1}$ map.

generalizability to new domains is improved, as demonstrated here with novel

the signal observation time is infinite. However, the calculation of
finite-time mutual information, which remains unknown, is essential for guiding
the design of practical communication systems. In this paper, we investigate
the mutual information between two correlated Gaussian processes within a
finite-time observation window. We first derive the finite-time mutual
information by providing a limit expression. Then we numerically compute the
mutual information within a single finite-time window. We reveal that the
number of bits transmitted per second within the finite-time window can exceed
the mutual information averaged over the entire time axis, which is called the
exceed-average phenomenon. Furthermore, we derive a finite-time mutual
information formula under a typical signal autocorrelation case by utilizing
the Mercer expansion of trace class operators, and reveal the connection
between the finite-time mutual information problem and the operator theory.
Finally, we analytically prove the existence of the exceed-average phenomenon
in this typical case, and demonstrate its compatibility with the Shannon
capacity.

determined by the number $n$ of vortices shed per half-period. It is found that
this number is identical to the superfluid Reynolds number. The possibility of
moving a levitating sphere through superfluid $^3$He at microkelvin
temperatures is considered. A laser beam moving through a Bose-Einstein

BEC. In particular, in either case a linear dependence of the shedding
frequency $f_v$ on $\Delta v = v - v_c$ is observed, where $v$ is the velocity
amplitude of the sphere or the constant velocity of the laser beam above $v_c$
for the onset of turbulent flow: $f_v = a \Delta v$, where the coefficient $a$
is proportional to the oscillation frequency $ \omega $ above some
characteristic frequency $\omega_k$ and assumes a finite value for steady

Energy Storage Systems (BESSs). While exploiting further the synergy between
BESSs and slow ramping resources, the proposed scheme offers an insight into
the energy-neutral operation, which is achieved by smoothly discontinuing the
BESS participation along with the minimization of Area Injection Error (AIE), a
variant of traditional Area Control Error (ACE). The first stage of ORRA is to
incorporate Neural Networks (NNs) with the AIE in order to ensure a zero-mean
of ramping reserves to be allocated among BESSs. These AIE signals are then
used to formulate the optimal coordination of BESS as an online optimization
problem, which is therefore feedback-driven. Finally, a distributed
optimization algorithm is developed to solve the formulated problem in
real-time, achieving a sublinear dynamic regret that quantifies the cost
difference to the trajectory computed by a centralized optimizer with perfect
global information. Consistent with the geographical distribution of BESSs, the
proposed ORRA is fully distributed such that the algorithm can be executed in
parallel at all nodes. Simulations on a modified IEEE 14-bus system are

database systems that concurrently support transactions and data analytics.
These hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) database systems
can support real-time data analysis without the high costs of synchronizing
across separate single-purpose databases. Unfortunately, for many applications
that perform a high rate of data updates, state-of-the-art HTAP systems incur
significant losses in transactional (up to 74.6%) and/or analytical (up to
49.8%) throughput compared to performing only transactional or only analytical
queries in isolation, due to (1) data movement between the CPU and memory, (2)
data update propagation from transactional to analytical workloads, and (3) the
cost to maintain a consistent view of data across the system.
  We propose Polynesia, a hardware-software co-designed system for in-memory
HTAP databases that avoids the large throughput losses of traditional HTAP
systems. Polynesia (1) divides the HTAP system into transactional and
analytical processing islands, (2) implements new custom hardware that unlocks
software optimizations to reduce the costs of update propagation and
consistency, and (3) exploits processing-in-memory for the analytical islands
to alleviate data movement overheads. Our evaluation shows that Polynesia
outperforms three state-of-the-art HTAP systems, with average
transactional/analytical throughput improvements of 1.7x/3.7x, and reduces
energy consumption by 48% over the prior lowest-energy HTAP system.

of a single commit. However, refactorings may be performed over multiple
commits because of code complexity or other real development problems, which is
why attempting to detect refactorings at single-commit granularity is
insufficient. We observe that some refactorings can be detected only at coarser
granularity, that is, changes spread across multiple commits. Herein, this type
of refactoring is referred to as coarse-grained refactoring (CGR). We compared
the refactorings detected on different granularities of commits from 19
open-source repositories. The results show that CGRs are common, and their
frequency increases as the granularity becomes coarser. In addition, we found
that Move-related refactorings tended to be the most frequent CGRs. We also

by the principle of PCA, a novel type of learning discriminative matrix
information geometry (MIG) detectors in the unsupervised scenario are
developed, and applied to signal detection in nonhomogeneous environments.
Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices can be used to model the sample
data, while the clutter covariance matrix is estimated by the geometric mean of
a set of secondary HPD matrices. We define a projection that maps the HPD
matrices in a high-dimensional manifold to a low-dimensional and more
discriminative one to increase the degree of separation of HPD matrices by
maximizing the data variance. Learning a mapping can be formulated as a
two-step mini-max optimization problem in Riemannian manifolds, which can be
solved by the Riemannian gradient descent algorithm. Three discriminative MIG
detectors are illustrated with respect to different geometric measures, i.e.,
the Log-Euclidean metric, the Jensen--Bregman LogDet divergence and the
symmetrized Kullback--Leibler divergence. Simulation results show that
performance improvements of the novel MIG detectors can be achieved compared

nitrogen, an essential element. Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, with its
dense atmosphere of molecular nitrogen and methane, offers an exceptional
opportunity to explore how this element is incorporated into carbon chains

consistently produced in the atmosphere and accumulates on the surface on the
moon. This solid material is nitrogen-rich and may contain prebiotic molecules
carrying nitrogen. Aims. To date, our knowledge of the processes leading to the
incorporation of nitrogen into organic chains has been rather limited. In the
present work, we investigate the formation of nitrogen-bearing ions in an
experiment simulating Titan s upper atmosphere, with strong implications for
the incorporation of nitrogen into organic matter on Titan. Methods. By
combining experiments and theoretical calculations, we show that the abundant
N2+ ion, produced at high altitude by extreme-ultraviolet solar radiation, is
able to form nitrogen-rich organic species. Results. An unexpected and
important formation of CH3N2+ and CH2N2+ diazo-ions is experimentally observed
when exposing a gas mixture composed of molecular nitrogen and methane to
extreme-ultraviolet radiation. Our theoretical calculations show that these
diazo-ions are mainly produced by the reaction of N2+ with CH3 radicals. These
small nitrogen-rich diazo-ions, with a N/C ratio of two, appear to be a missing
link that could explain the high nitrogen content in Titan s organic matter.
More generally, this work highlights the importance of reactions between ions
and radicals, which have rarely been studied thus far, opening up new
perspectives in astrochemistry.

attracted much attention for the last years. Since finding such a set of good

for the problem so far, most of which are either approximate or incomplete. To
overcome this difficulty, we study efficient enumeration of all good models for
a subclass of interpretable models, called rule lists. Based on a
state-of-the-art optimal rule list learner, CORELS, proposed by Angelino et al.
in 2017, we present an efficient enumeration algorithm CorelsEnum for exactly
computing a set of all good models using polynomial space in input size, given
a dataset and a error tolerance from an optimal model. By experiments with the
COMPAS dataset on recidivism prediction, our algorithm CorelsEnum successfully
enumerated all of several tens of thousands of good rule lists of length at
most $\ell = 3$ in around 1,000 seconds, while a state-of-the-art top-$K$ rule
list learner based on Lawler's method combined with CORELS, proposed by Hara
and Ishihata in 2018, found only 40 models until the timeout of 6,000 seconds.
For global analysis, we conducted experiments for characterizing the Rashomon
set, and observed large diversity of models in predictive multiplicity and
fairness of models.

  Concerning shift complexity, explicit bounds are given on how slow-growing
$q$ must be for any member of $\rm{LUA}(q)$ to compute $\delta$-shift complex

shift complexity to consider sequences $X$ satisfying $\operatorname{KP}(\tau)
\geq f(|\tau|) - O(1)$ for all substrings $\tau$ of $X$ where $f$ is any order
function. We show that for sufficiently slow-growing $f$, $f$-shift complex
sequences can be uniformly computed by $g$-complex sequences, where $g$ grows
slightly faster than $f$.
  The structure of the $\mathrm{LUA}$ hierarchy is examined using bushy tree
forcing, with the main result being that for any order function $p$, there is a
slow-growing order function $q$ such that $\mathrm{LUA}(p)$ and

problem. Most existing self-supervised and unsupervised approaches in the
time-series domain do not capture low and high-frequency features at the same
time. Further, some of these methods employ large scale models like
transformers or rely on computationally expensive techniques such as
contrastive learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a non-contrastive
self-supervised learning approach efficiently captures low and high-frequency
time-varying features in a cost-effective manner. Our method takes raw time
series data as input and creates two different augmented views for two branches
of the model, by randomly sampling the augmentations from same family.
Following the terminology of BYOL, the two branches are called online and
target network which allows bootstrapping of the latent representation. In
contrast to BYOL, where a backbone encoder is followed by multilayer perceptron
(MLP) heads, the proposed model contains additional temporal convolutional
network (TCN) heads. As the augmented views are passed through large kernel
convolution blocks of the encoder, the subsequent combination of MLP and TCN
enables an effective representation of low as well as high-frequency
time-varying features due to the varying receptive fields. The two modules (MLP
and TCN) act in a complementary manner. We train an online network where each
module learns to predict the outcome of the respective module of target network
branch. To demonstrate the robustness of our model we performed extensive

study the trade-offs between the convergence rate (which quantifies how fast
the initial conditions are forgotten) and the ""risk"" of suboptimality, i.e.
deviations from the expected suboptimality. We focus on a general class of
momentum methods (GMM) which recover popular methods such as gradient descent
(GD), accelerated gradient descent (AGD), and heavy-ball (HB) method as special
cases depending on the choice of GMM parameters. We use well-known risk
measures ""entropic risk"" and ""entropic value at risk"" to quantify the risk of
suboptimality. For strongly convex smooth minimization, we first obtain new
convergence rate results for GMM with a unified theory that is also applicable
to both AGD and HB, improving some of the existing results for HB. We then
provide explicit bounds on the entropic risk and entropic value at risk of
suboptimality at a given iterate which also provides direct bounds on the
probability that the suboptimality exceeds a given threshold based on
Chernoff's inequality. Our results unveil fundamental trade-offs between the
convergence rate and the risk of suboptimality. We then plug the entropic risk
and convergence rate estimates we obtained in a computationally tractable
optimization framework and propose entropic risk-averse GMM (RA-GMM) and
entropic risk-averse AGD (RA-AGD) methods which can select the GMM parameters
to systematically trade-off the entropic value at risk with the convergence
rate. We show that RA-AGD and RA-GMM lead to improved performance on quadratic
optimization and logistic regression problems compared to the standard choice
of parameters. To our knowledge, our work is the first to resort to coherent
measures to design the parameters of momentum methods in a systematic manner.

cancer patients using whole slide images (WSIs).However, identification of
image phenotypes within the WSIs that are relevant to patient survival and
disease progression is difficult for both clinicians, and deep learning
algorithms. Most deep learning based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
algorithms for survival prediction use either top instances (e.g., maxpooling)
or top/bottom instances (e.g., MesoNet) to identify image phenotypes. In this
study, we hypothesize that wholistic information of the distribution of the
patch scores within a WSI can predict the cancer survival better. We developed
a distribution based multiple-instance survival learning algorithm
(DeepDisMISL) to validate this hypothesis. We designed and executed experiments
using two large international colorectal cancer WSIs datasets - MCO CRC and
TCGA COAD-READ. Our results suggest that the more information about the
distribution of the patch scores for a WSI, the better is the prediction
performance. Including multiple neighborhood instances around each selected
distribution location (e.g., percentiles) could further improve the prediction.
DeepDisMISL demonstrated superior predictive ability compared to other recently

Nonrelativistic QCD which entails the Schoedinger equation as zero order

to explore quarkonium properties in the realm of QCD. In particular it allows
us to make calculations with unprecedented precision when high order

from long range contributions where observables are sensitive to the
nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. Such effective field theory treatment can be
extended at finite temperature and in presence of gluonic and light quark

verification of quantitative properties of quantitative systems. These systems
are found in numerous applications, and their quantitative verification is
important, but also rather challenging. In particular, given that most systems
found in applications are rather big, compositionality and incrementality of
verification methods are essential.
  In order to ensure robustness of verification, we replace the Boolean yes-no
answers of standard verification with distances. Depending on the application
context, many different types of distances are being employed in quantitative
verification. Consequently, there is a need for a general theory of system
distances which abstracts away from the concrete distances and develops
quantitative verification at a level independent of the distance. It is our
view that in a theory of quantitative verification, the quantitative aspects
should be treated just as much as input to a verification problem as the
qualitative aspects are. In this work we develop such a general theory of
quantitative verification. We assume as input a distance between traces, or
executions, and then employ the theory of games with quantitative objectives to
define distances between quantitative systems. Different versions of the
quantitative bisimulation game give rise to different types of distances,
viz.~bisimulation distance, simulation distance, trace equivalence distance,
etc., enabling us to construct a quantitative generalization of van Glabbeek's
linear-time--branching-time spectrum. We also extend our general theory of
quantitative verification to a theory of quantitative specifications. For this
we use modal transition systems, and we develop the quantitative properties of
the usual operators for behavioral specification theories.

applications requires increased fault coverage. However, generating a test set
using commercial automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) tools that lead to
zero-defect escape is still an open problem. It is challenging to detect all
stuck-at faults to reach 100% fault coverage. In parallel, the hardware
security community has been actively involved in developing solutions for logic
locking to prevent IP piracy. Locks (e.g., XOR gates) are inserted in different
locations of the netlist so that an adversary cannot determine the secret key.
Unfortunately, the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based attack, introduced in
[1], can break different logic locking schemes in minutes. In this paper, we
propose a novel test pattern generation approach using the powerful SAT attack
on logic locking. A stuck-at fault is modeled as a locked gate with a secret
key. Our modeling of stuck-at faults preserves the property of fault activation
and propagation. We show that the input pattern that determines the key is a
test for the stuck-at fault. We propose two different approaches for test
pattern generation. First, a single stuck-at fault is targeted, and a
corresponding locked circuit with one key bit is created. This approach
generates one test pattern per fault. Second, we consider a group of faults and
convert the circuit to its locked version with multiple key bits. The inputs
obtained from the SAT tool are the test set for detecting this group of faults.
Our approach is able to find test patterns for hard-to-detect faults that were
previously failed in commercial ATPG tools. The proposed test pattern
generation approach can efficiently detect redundant faults present in a
circuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on ITC'99 benchmarks.
The results show that we can achieve a perfect fault coverage reaching 100%.

incident polarization, restricting its applications. Here, we report, for the

metasurfaces composed of periodic Ge$_2$Se$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) disks. For such a

appropriate GST crystalline fraction regardless of the incident polarization.
The operation wavelength and the required GST crystalline fraction can be
conveniently tuned over large ranges since these parameters scale linearly with
the disk size and the lattice period, greatly facilitating the design. Making
use of the obtained resonant lattice Kerker effect, we realize a reconfigurable

been extensively studied both for its methodological richness and its various
practical applications. With the expansion of inclusive finance, recent
attentions are paid to micro and small-sized enterprises (MSEs). Compared with
large companies, MSEs present a higher exposure rate to default owing to their
insecure financial stability. Conventional efforts learn classifiers from
historical data with elaborate feature engineering. However, the main obstacle
for MSEs involves severe deficiency in credit-related information, which may
degrade the performance of prediction. Besides, financial activities have
diverse explicit and implicit relations, which have not been fully exploited
for risk judgement in commercial banks. In particular, the observations on real
data show that various relationships between company users have additional
power in financial risk analysis. In this paper, we consider a graph of banking
data, and propose a novel HIDAM model for the purpose. Specifically, we attempt
to incorporate heterogeneous information network with rich attributes on
multi-typed nodes and links for modeling the scenario of business banking
service. To enhance feature representation of MSEs, we extract interactive
information through meta-paths and fully exploit path information. Furthermore,
we devise a hierarchical attention mechanism respectively to learn the
importance of contents inside each meta-path and the importance of different
metapahs. Experimental results verify that HIDAM outperforms state-of-the-art
competitors on real-world banking data.

the most fundamental critical phenomena for the study of complex systems. On
simple networks, percolation displays a second-order phase transition; on
multiplex networks, the percolation transition can become discontinuous.
However, little is known about percolation in networks with higher-order
interactions. Here, we show that percolation can be turned into a fully-fledged
dynamical process when higher-order interactions are taken into account. By
introducing signed triadic interactions, in which a node can regulate the
interactions between two other nodes, we define triadic percolation. We uncover
that in this paradigmatic model the connectivity of the network changes in time
and that the order parameter undergoes a period-doubling and a route to chaos.
We provide a general theory for triadic percolation which accurately predicts
the full phase diagram on random graphs as confirmed by extensive numerical
simulations. We find that triadic percolation on real network topologies
reveals a similar phenomenology. These results radically change our
understanding of percolation and may be used to study complex systems in which
the functional connectivity is changing in time dynamically and in a
non-trivial way, such as in neural and climate networks.

syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been found rapid and large-scale
diagnosis to spread across the communities. The risk of infectious airborne
aerosol transmission has been an area of increasing concern. In this regard, a
selective optic detection of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol is highly desirable, which can
actively collect the surrounding air samples and provide real-time feedbacks to
users. In this work, we developed an integrated Air Quality Monitoring System
(iAQMS) that enables real-time SARS-CoV-2 aerosol detection with high
sensitivity. The detection device, inspired by localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR), was designed to measure the intensity changes of light going
through our biochips in which gold nanoparticles (AuNP) combined with
antibodies were exposed to airflow containing virus aerosols. We found that the
variation of the measured photocurrent after 350 seconds of exposure to virus
aerosols is a function of virus particle concentrations. By incorporating the
air collection device and the optic detection device into a handheld sized
device that can communicate with a smart-phone through Bluetooth serial, we
demonstrate real-time and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus aerosols with
a concentration dynamic range of 0.00001 - 0.1 pfu/uL. Because of its
sensitivity and reliability, our device can also be used for detection of other
virus aerosols by simply switching the antibodies combined to the AuNP in the
biochips.

items brought by the massive logistic orders from e-commerce. A key to
automated item distribution is to plan paths for robots, also known as task
planning, where each task is to deliver racks with items to pickers for
processing and then return the rack back. Prior solutions are unfit for
large-scale robotized warehouses due to the inflexibility to time-varying item
arrivals and the low efficiency for high throughput. In this paper, we propose
a new task planning problem called TPRW, which aims to minimize the end-to-end
makespan that incorporates the entire item distribution pipeline, known as a
fulfilment cycle. Direct extensions from state-of-the-art path finding methods
are ineffective to solve the TPRW problem because they fail to adapt to the
bottleneck variations of fulfillment cycles. In response, we propose Efficient
Adaptive Task Planning, a framework for large-scale robotized warehouses with
time-varying item arrivals. It adaptively selects racks to fulfill at each
timestamp via reinforcement learning, accounting for the time-varying
bottleneck of the fulfillment cycles. Then it finds paths for robots to
transport the selected racks. The framework adopts a series of efficient
optimizations on both time and memory to handle large-scale item throughput.
Evaluations on both synthesized and real data show an improvement of $37.1\%$
in effectiveness and $75.5\%$ in efficiency over the state-of-the-arts.

its ability to accurately detect and quantify inequality proportionally to
controlled inequalities. Extensive analyses were carried out to quantify health
inequalities (a) embedded in two real-world ICU datasets; (b) induced by AI
models trained for two resource allocation scenarios. Results showed that
compared to men, women had up to 33% poorer deterioration in markers of
prognosis when admitted to HiRID ICUs. All four AI models assessed were shown
to induce significant inequalities (2.45% to 43.2%) for non-White compared to
White patients. The models exacerbated data embedded inequalities significantly
in 3 out of 8 assessments, one of which was >9 times worse.
