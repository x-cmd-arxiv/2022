the surge of face manipulation models; new forgery approaches emerge at an
unprecedented pace. Unfortunately, existing forgery detection methods suffer
significant performance drops when applied to novel forgery approaches. In this
work, we address the few-shot forgery detection problem by designing a
comprehensive benchmark based on coverage analysis among various forgery
approaches, and proposing Guided Adversarial Interpolation (GAI). Our key
insight is that there exist transferable distribution characteristics among
different forgery approaches with the majority and minority classes.
Specifically, we enhance the discriminative ability against novel forgery
approaches via adversarially interpolating the artifacts of the minority
samples to the majority samples under the guidance of a teacher network. Unlike
the standard re-balancing method which usually results in over-fitting to
minority classes, our method simultaneously takes account of the diversity of
majority information as well as the significance of minority information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GAI achieves state-of-the-art
performances on the established few-shot forgery detection benchmark. Notably,
our method is also validated to be robust to choices of majority and minority
forgery approaches.

We use stringent tests on both simulated and real data, as well as comparison
to public catalogues to evaluate the advantages of using multi-band over

significant advantages when trying to decompose galaxies into their individual
constituents, as more data are being used, by effectively being able to use the
colour information buried in the individual exposures to its advantage. Using
simulated data, we find that multi-band fitting significantly reduces the
deviations from real parameter values, allows component sizes and S\'ersic
indices to be recovered more accurately, and, by design, constrains the
band-to-band variations of these parameters to more physical values. On both
simulated and real data, we confirm that the SEDs of the 2 main components can
be recovered to fainter magnitudes compared to using single-band fitting, which
tends to recover disks and bulges to - on average - have identical SEDs when
the galaxies become too faint, instead of the different SEDs they truly have.
By comparing our results to those provided by other fitting codes, we confirm
that they agree in general, but measurement errors can be significantly reduced
by using the multi-band tools developed by the MegaMorph project. We conclude
that the multi-band fitting employed by Galapagos-2 and Galfitm significantly
improves the accuracy of structural galaxy parameters and enables much larger

We find that by correcting for regions of compressed primordial field and
accounting for the fact that part of the intergalactic medium is occupied by

condensed matter physics. A major effort in this direction has been devoted to
using classical light in the form of Floquet drives to manipulate and induce
states with non-trivial topology. A different route can be achieved with cavity
photons. Here we consider a prototypical model for topological phase
transition, the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, coupled to a
single mode cavity. We show that quantum light can affect the topological
properties of the system, including the finite-length energy spectrum hosting
edge modes and the topological phase diagram. In particular we show that
depending on the lattice geometry and the strength of light-matter coupling one
can either turn a trivial phase into a topological one or viceversa using
quantum cavity fields. Furthermore, we compute the polariton spectrum of the
coupled electron-photon system, and we note that the lower polariton branch
disappears at the topological transition point. This phenomenon can be used to
probe the phase transition in the SSH model.

the global convergence of the algorithm with an algebraic rate both in

simulations of LSNe that simultaneously learns spatial and temporal
relationships from time series of images. We find that our method obtains a LSN

DeepZipper selected 2,245 candidates from a magnitude-limited ($m_i$ $<$ 22.5)

unable to answer questions like: Do loyal users enjoy better recommendations
than non-loyal users? Loyalty can be defined by the time period a user has been
active in a recommender system, or by the number of historical interactions a
user has. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive analysis of recommendation
results along global timeline. We conduct experiments with five widely used
models, i.e., BPR, NeuMF, LightGCN, SASRec and TiSASRec, on four benchmark

experiment results give an answer ""No"" to the above question. Users with many
historical interactions suffer from relatively poorer recommendations. Users
who stay with the system for a shorter time period enjoy better
recommendations. Both findings are counter-intuitive. Interestingly, users who
have recently interacted with the system, with respect to the time point of the
test instance, enjoy better recommendations. The finding on recency applies to
all users, regardless of users' loyalty. Our study offers a different

remained largely unaddressed. The lack of a framework with training protocols,
baseline models and suitable metrics, has so far hindered research in this

dialogue policy optimisation to go from static to dynamic learning. We provide
a continual learning algorithm, baseline architectures and metrics for
assessing continual learning models. Moreover, we propose the dynamic dialogue

significant zero-shot performance when being exposed to unseen domains, without

  npm Packages Releases","19 pages, 2 figures, Journal",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semantic versioning policy is widely used to indicate the level of changes in
a package release. Unfortunately, there are many cases where developers do not
respect the semantic versioning policy, leading to the breakage of dependent
applications. To reduce such cases, we proposed using machine learning (ML)
techniques to effectively predict the new release type, i.e., patch, minor,
major, in order to properly determine the semantic versioning type. To perform
our prediction, we mined and used a number of features about a release, such as
the complexity of the changed code, change types, and development activities.
We then used four ML classifiers. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
ML classifiers, we conducted an empirical study on 31 JavaScript packages
containing a total of approximately 6,260 releases. We started by extracting 41
release level features from historical data of packages' source code and
repositories. Then, we used four machine learning classifiers, namely XGBoost,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. We found that the
XGBoost classifiers performed the best, achieving median ROC AUC values of
0.78, 0.69, and 0.74 for major, minor, and patch releases, respectively. We
also found that features related to the change types in a release are the best
predictors group of features in determining the semantic versioning type.
Finally, we studied the generalizability of determining the semantic versioning
type by applying cross-package validation. Our results showed that the general
classifier achieved median ROC AUC values of 0.76, 0.69, and 0.75 for major,
minor, and patch releases.

exploration for better superconductors proceeded without knowledge of the

following half century higher critical temperature T$_c$ was achieved only
serendipitously as new materials were synthesized. Meanwhile the formal theory
of phonon-coupled superconductivity at the material-dependent level became
highly developed: given a known compound, its value of T$_c$, the
superconducting gap function, and several other properties of the
superconducting state became available independent of further experimental
input. More recently, density functional theory based computational materials
design has progressed to a predictive level -- new materials can be predicted
on the basis of various numerical algorithms. Taken together, these
capabilities enable theoretical prediction of new superconductors. Here the
process that resulted in three new highest temperature superconductors,
predicted numerically, confirmed experimentally -- SH$_3$, LaH$_{10}$, and
YH$_9$ -- is recounted. These hydrides have T$_c$ in the 200-280K range at

theorem improves estimates due to several earlier researchers and shows that if
$G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\hom (G) \geq n^{1/2}$ then $f(G) \geq \big (
{n}/{\hom (G)} \big )^{1 - o(1)}$. The bound here is sharp up to the
$o(1)$-term, and asymptotically solves a conjecture of Narayanan and Tomon. In
particular, this implies that $\max \{ \hom (G), f(G) \} \geq n^{1/2 -o(1)}$
for any $n$-vertex graph $G$,which is also sharp. The above relationship
between $\hom (G)$ and $f(G)$ breaks down in the regime where $\hom (G) <

biased random graphs, i.e. on $f\big (G(n,p) \big )$. We believe that the
behaviour here determines the extremal relationship between $\hom (G)$ and
$f(G)$ in this second regime. Our approach to lower bounding $f(G)$ proceeds
via a translation into an (almost) equivalent probabilistic problem, and it can
be shown to be effective for arbitrary graphs. It may be of independent

acting on 1D systems. They model a wide variety of situations, including
communication channels with memory effects, quantum cellular automata, mixed
states in 1D quantum systems, or holographic boundary models associated to 2D
quantum systems. A scenario where MPOs have proven particularly useful is to
represent algebras of non-trivial symmetries. Concretely, the boundary of both
symmetry protected and topologically ordered phases in 2D quantum systems
exhibit symmetries in the form of MPOs.
  In this paper, we develop a theory of MPOs as representations of algebraic
structures. We establish a dictionary between algebra and MPO properties which
allows to transfer results between both setups, covering the cases of
pre-bialgebras, weak bialgebras, and weak Hopf algebras. We define the notion
of pulling-through algebras, which abstracts the minimal requirements needed to
define topologically ordered 2D tensor networks from MPO algebras. We show, as
one of our main results, that any semisimple pivotal weak Hopf algebra is a
pulling-trough algebra. We demonstrate the power of this framework by showing
that they can be used to construct Kitaev's quantum double models for Hopf
algebras solely from an MPO representation of the Hopf algebra, in the exact
same way as MPO symmetries obtained from fusion categories can be used to
construct Levin-Wen string-net models, and to explain all their topological
features; it thus allows to describe both Kitaev and string-net models on the
same formal footing.

  Task-Transferable Neural Architecture Search","Accepted by CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to find efficient models for multiple
tasks. Beyond seeking solutions for a single task, there are surging interests
in transferring network design knowledge across multiple tasks. In this line of
research, effectively modeling task correlations is vital yet highly neglected.
Therefore, we propose \textbf{Arch-Graph}, a transferable NAS method that
predicts task-specific optimal architectures with respect to given task
embeddings. It leverages correlations across multiple tasks by using their
embeddings as a part of the predictor's input for fast adaptation. We also
formulate NAS as an architecture relation graph prediction problem, with the
relational graph constructed by treating candidate architectures as nodes and
their pairwise relations as edges. To enforce some basic properties such as
acyclicity in the relational graph, we add additional constraints to the
optimization process, converting NAS into the problem of finding a Maximal
Weighted Acyclic Subgraph (MWAS). Our algorithm then strives to eliminate
cycles and only establish edges in the graph if the rank results can be
trusted. Through MWAS, Arch-Graph can effectively rank candidate models for
each task with only a small budget to finetune the predictor. With extensive
experiments on TransNAS-Bench-101, we show Arch-Graph's transferability and
high sample efficiency across numerous tasks, beating many NAS methods designed
for both single-task and multi-task search. It is able to find top 0.16\% and
0.29\% architectures on average on two search spaces under the budget of only
50 models.

share a common theory, which is based on a one-dimensional model of rotating,
stratified flow over a sloping, insulated boundary. This commonly used model,
however, lacks rapid adjustment of interior flows, limiting its ability to
capture the full physics of spin up and spin down of along-slope flow.
Motivated by two-dimensional dynamics, the present work extends the
one-dimensional model by constraining the vertically integrated cross-slope
transport and allowing for a barotropic cross-slope pressure gradient. This
produces a closed secondary circulation by forcing Ekman transport in the
bottom boundary layer to return in the interior. The extended model can thus
capture Ekman spin up and spin down physics: the interior return flow is turned
by the Coriolis acceleration, leading to rapid \linelabel{ll:slowdiff}rather
than slow diffusive adjustment of the along-slope flow. This
transport-constrained one-dimensional model accurately describes
two-dimensional mixing-generated spin up over an idealized ridge and provides a

turbulent mixing. Recent studies have identified thin bottom boundary layers
(BLs) as locations of intense upwelling, yet it remains unclear how they
interact with and shape the large-scale circulation of the abyssal ocean. The
current understanding of this BL--interior coupling is shaped by 1D theory,
suggesting that variations in locally produced BL transport generate exchange
with the interior and thus a global circulation. Until now, however, this
picture has been based on a 1D theory that fails to capture the local evolution
in even highly idealized 2D geometries. The present work applies BL theory to
revised 1D dynamics, which more naturally generalizes to two and three
dimensions. The BL is assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium between the upwelling
of dense water and the convergence of downward buoyancy fluxes. The BL
transport, for which explicit formulae are presented, exerts an influence on
the interior by modifying the bottom boundary condition. In 1D, this BL
transport is independent of the interior evolution, but in 2D the BL and
interior are fully coupled. Once interior variables and the bottom slope are
allowed to vary in the horizontal, the resulting convergences and divergences
in the BL transport exchange mass with the interior. This framework allows for
the analysis of previously inaccessible problems such as the BL--interior
coupling in the presence of an exponential interior stratification, laying the
foundation for developing a full theory for the abyssal circulation.

intuitive ways to share thoughts and emotions, such as tapping to get one's
attention or caressing to soothe one's anxiety. A deeper understanding of these
human-to-human interactions will require, in part, the precise measurement of
skin-to-skin physical contact. Among prior efforts, each measurement approach
exhibits certain constraints, e.g., motion trackers do not capture the precise
shape of skin surfaces, while pressure sensors impede direct skin contact. In
contrast, this work develops an interference-free 3D visual tracking system
using a depth camera to measure the contact attributes between the bare hand of
a toucher and the forearm of a receiver. The toucher's hand is tracked as a
posed and positioned mesh by fitting a hand model to detected 3D joints,
whereas the forearm is extracted as a detailed 3D surface. Based on a contact
model of point clouds, the spatiotemporal contact changes are decomposed as six
high-resolution time-series attributes, i.e., contact area, indentation depth,
absolute velocity, and three orthogonal velocity components, together with
contact duration. To examine the system's capabilities and limitations, two
experiments were performed. First, to evaluate its ability to discern human
touches, one person delivered cued social messages, e.g., happiness, anger,
sympathy, to another using their preferred gestures. The results indicated that
messages, gestures, and the individual touchers, were readily discerned from
their contact attributes. Second, the measurement accuracy was validated
against independent devices, including an electromagnetic tracker, pressure
mat, and laser sensor. While validated here in the context of social

maternal care of infants and massage therapy.

block encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, whose implementation is known to
require a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue
transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QET-U), which uses a
controlled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit and
no multi-qubit control operations, and is thus suitable for early
fault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that
outperforms all previous algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for
estimating the ground state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians,
we propose a new method that exploits certain anti-commutation relations and
further removes the need of implementing the controlled Hamiltonian evolution.
Coupled with Trotter based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the
resulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum
devices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM Qiskit for
the transverse field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multi-qubit
Toffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary
amplitude estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases
the total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal
complexity for ground state preparation and energy estimating using a constant

using artificially designed magnetic field landscapes (MFL) is promising for
the implementation of key functionalities in Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. A
close-to-substrate transport is hereby instrumental to use changing
particle-substrate interactions upon analyte binding for analytics and
diagnostics. Here, we present an essential prerequisite for such an
application, namely the label-free quantitative experimental determination of
the three-dimensional trajectories of superparamagnetic particles (SPP)
transported by a dynamically changing MFL above a topographically flat
substrate. The evaluation of the SPP sharpness within defocused video-recorded
images, acquired by an optical bright-field microscope, was employed to obtain
a vertical z-coordinate. This method applied to a prototypical transport
scheme, using the static MFL of parallel-stripe domains superposed by a
particular magnetic field pulse sequence, revealed a hopping-like motion of the
magnetic particles, previously predicted by theory. Maximum vertical particle
jumps of several micrometers have been observed experimentally, corroborating
theoretical estimates for the particle-substrate distance. As our findings pave
the way towards precise quantification of particle-substrate separations in the
discussed transport system, they bear deep implications for future LOC
detection schemes using only optical microscopy.

etc. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) are
two commonly used signal decomposition tools for surface roughness and texture
analysis. Both methods require selecting a threshold to decompose a given
surface into its three main components: form, waviness, and roughness. However,
although DWT and DCT are part of the ISO surface finish standards, there exists
no systematic guidance on how to compute these thresholds, and they are often
manually selected on case by case basis. This makes utilizing these methods for
studying surfaces dependent on the user's judgment and limits their automation
potential. Therefore, we present two automatic threshold selection algorithms
based on information theory and signal energy. We use machine learning to
validate the success of our algorithms both using simulated surfaces as well as
digital microscopy images of machined surfaces. Specifically, we generate
feature vectors for each surface area or profile and apply supervised
classification. Comparing our results with the heuristic threshold selection
approach shows good agreement with mean accuracies as high as 95\%. We also
compare our results with Gaussian filtering (GF) and show that while GF results
for areas can yield slightly higher accuracies, our results outperform GF for
surface profiles. We further show that our automatic threshold selection has
significant advantages in terms of computational time as evidenced by
decreasing the number of mode computations by an order of magnitude compared to
the heuristic thresholding for DCT.

maintenance. However, manual bug fixing scheduling can be time-consuming,
cumbersome, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose the Schedule and
Dependency-aware Bug Triage (S-DABT), a bug triaging method that utilizes
integer programming and machine learning techniques to assign bugs to suitable
developers. Unlike prior works that largely focus on a single component of the
bug reports, our approach takes into account the textual data, bug fixing
costs, and bug dependencies. We further incorporate the schedule of developers
in our formulation to have a more comprehensive model for this multifaceted
problem. As a result, this complete formulation considers developers' schedules
and the blocking effects of the bugs while covering the most significant
aspects of the previously proposed methods. Our numerical study on four
open-source software systems, namely, EclipseJDT, LibreOffice, GCC, and
Mozilla, shows that taking into account the schedules of the developers
decreases the average bug fixing times. We find that S-DABT leads to a high
level of developer utilization through a fair distribution of the tasks among
the developers and efficient use of the free spots in their schedules. Via the
simulation of the issue tracking system, we also show how incorporating the
schedule in the model formulation reduces the bug fixing time, improves the
assignment accuracy, and utilizes the capability of each developer without much
comprising in the model run times. We find that S-DABT decreases the complexity
of the bug dependency graph by prioritizing blocking bugs and effectively
reduces the infeasible assignment ratio due to bug dependencies. Consequently,
we recommend considering developers' schedules while automating bug triage.

video captioning are vast, mainly to deal with a significant amount of video
recordings in video surveillance, or assisting people visually impaired, to
mention a few. To analyze where the efforts of our community to solve the video
captioning task are, as well as what route could be better to follow, this
manuscript presents an extensive review of more than 105 papers for the period
of 2016 to 2021. As a result, the most-used datasets and metrics are
identified. Also, the main approaches used and the best ones. We compute a set
of rankings based on several performance metrics to obtain, according to its
performance, the best method with the best result on the video captioning task.
Finally, some insights are concluded about which could be the next steps or
opportunity areas to improve dealing with this complex task.

that are isolated and gas-rich. Assuming that the dark matter halos of these

(which allows for constant-density cores), the inferred halo concentrations are
systematically lower than the cosmological median, even as low as $-0.6$ dex
(about $5\sigma$ away) in some cases. Alternatively, similar fits can be
obtained with a density profile that scales roughly as $1/r^2$ for radii larger
than a few kiloparsecs. Both solutions require the radius where the halo
circular velocity peaks ($R_{\rm max}$) to be much larger than the median
expectation. Surprisingly, we find an overabundance of such large-$R_{\rm max}$
halos in the IllustrisTNG dark-matter-only simulations compared to the Gaussian
expectation. These halos form late and have higher spins compared to median
halos of similar masses. The inner densities of the most extreme among these
late-forming halos are higher than their NFW counterparts, leading to a $\sim
1/r^2$ density profile. However, the two well-resolved UDGs in our sample
strongly prefer lower dark matter densities in the center than the simulated
ones. Comparing to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we also find a
tension in getting both low enough circular velocities and high enough halo
mass to accommodate the measurements. Our results indicate that the gas-rich
UDGs present a significant challenge for galaxy formation models.

  Counting",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Safe memory reclamation (SMR) schemes are an essential tool for lock-free
data structures and concurrent programming. However, manual SMR schemes are
notoriously difficult to apply correctly, and automatic schemes, such as
reference counting, have been argued for over a decade to be too slow for
practical purposes. A recent wave of work has disproved this long-held notion
and shown that reference counting can be as scalable as hazard pointers, one of
the most common manual techniques. Despite these tremendous improvements, there
remains a gap of up to 2x or more in performance between these schemes and
faster manual techniques such as epoch-based reclamation (EBR).
  In this work, we first advance these ideas and show that in many cases,
automatic reference counting can in fact be as fast as the fastest manual SMR
techniques. We generalize our previous Concurrent Deferred Reference Counting
(CDRC) algorithm to obtain a method for converting any standard manual SMR
technique into an automatic reference counting technique with a similar
performance profile. Our second contribution is extending this framework to
support weak pointers, which are reference-counted pointers that automatically
break pointer cycles by not contributing to the reference count, thus
addressing a common weakness in reference-counted garbage collection.
  Our experiments with a C++-library implementation show that our automatic
techniques perform in line with their manual counterparts, and that our weak
pointer implementation outperforms the best known atomic weak pointer library
by up to an order of magnitude on high thread counts. All together, we show
that the ease of use of automatic memory management can be achieved without
significant cost to practical performance or general applicability.

engineering. Computing their numerical solution, however, is challenging due to
its high dimensionality.
  In this work we develop an algorithm to efficiently solve the transport
equation in moderately complex geometrical domains using a Galerkin method
stabilized by streamline diffusion. The ansatz spaces are a tensor product of a
sparse grid in space and discontinuous piecewise polynomials in time. Here, the
sparse grid is constructed upon nested multilevel finite element spaces to
provide geometric flexibility. This results in an implicit time-stepping scheme
which we prove to be stable and convergent. If the solution has additional
mixed regularity, the convergence of a $2d$-dimensional problem equals that of
a $d$-dimensional one up to logarithmic factors.
  For the implementation, we rely on the sparse grid combination technique,
which enables us to store the functions and to carry out the computations on a
sequence of anisotropic full grids exploiting the tensor product structure of
the ansatz spaces. In this way existing finite element libraries and GPU
acceleration can be used. The combination technique is also used as a
preconditioner for an iterative scheme to solve the transport equation on the
sequence of time strips.
  Numerical tests show that the method works well for problems in up to six
dimensions. Finally, the method is also used as a building block to solve
nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson equations.

that greater environmental prestige leads to larger faculty-led research

not increase substantially with prestige for either faculty papers published

suggests that re-ranking could help correct prediction errors. We add a new,

benchmark datasets of entity linking: COMETA in the biomedical domain, and
AIDA-CoNLL in the news domain. We show through ablation studies that each of

for clusters $>100$ Myr. The kinematical substructures of f1-type clusters are
elongated; these resemble the disrupted cluster Group X. Kinematic tails are
distinct in t-type clusters, especially Pleiades. We identify 29 hierarchical
groups in four young regions (Alessi 20, IC 348, LP 2373, LP 2442); ten among
these are new. The hierarchical groups form filament networks. Two regions
(Alessi 20, LP 2373) exhibit global ""orthogonal"" expansion (stellar motion
perpendicular to the filament), which might cause complete dispersal.
Infalling-like flows (stellar motion along the filament) are found in UBC 31

2442 region (LP 2442 gp 1-5) are spatially well-mixed but kinematically
coherent. A merging process might be ongoing in the LP 2442 subgroups. For
younger systems ($\lesssim30$ Myr), the mean axis ratio, cluster mass and
half-mass radius tend to increase with age values. These correlations between
structural parameters may imply two dynamical processes occurring in the
hierarchical formation scenario in young stellar groups: (1) filament
dissolution and (2) sub-group mergers.

gravitational lensing, due to their brightness, extragalactic nature, and the
compact, coherent characteristics of their emission. In a companion work
[Kader, Leung+2022], we use a novel interferometric method to search for
gravitationally lensed FRBs in the time domain using bursts detected by
CHIME/FRB. There, we dechannelize and autocorrelate electric field data at a
time resolution of 1.25 ns. This enables a search for FRBs whose emission is
coherently deflected by gravitational lensing around a foreground compact
object such as a primordial black hole (PBH). Here, we use our non-detection of
lensed FRBs to place novel constraints on the PBH abundance outside the Local
Group. We use a novel two-screen model to take into account decoherence from
scattering screens in our constraints. Our constraints are subject to a single
astrophysical model parameter -- the effective distance between an FRB source
and the scattering screen, for which we adopt a fiducial distance of 1 parsec.
We find that coherent FRB lensing is a sensitive probe of sub-solar mass
compact objects. Having observed no lenses in $172$ bursts from $114$
independent sightlines through the cosmic web, we constrain the fraction of
dark matter made of compact objects, such as PBHs, to be $f \lesssim 0.8$, if

capture may occur when the orbital period around the SMBH (the ""outer binary"")
and the apsidal precession of the BHB (the ""inner binary"") are in a 1:1
commensurability. This effect is analogous to the phenomenon of lunar evection
resonance in the early Sun-Earth-Moon system, with the distinction that in the
present case, the BHB apsidal precession is due to general relativity, rather
than rotationally-induced distortion. In contrast to the case of lunar
evection, however, the inner binary undergoes orbital decay driven by GW
emission, rather than orbital expansion driven by tidal dissipation. This
distinction fundamentally alters the three-body dynamics, forbidding resonance
capture, and limiting eccentricity growth. However, if the BHB migrates through
of a gaseous AGN disk, the change in the outer binary can counterbalance the
suppressing effect of BHB decay, permitting evection resonance capture and the
production of eccentric BHB mergers. We compute the likelihood of resonance
capture assuming an agnostic distribution of parameters for the three bodies
involved and for the properties of the AGN disk. We find that intermediate-mass
ratio BHBs (involving an intermediate-mass black hole and a stellar-mass black
hole) are the most likely to be captured into evection resonance and thus
undergo an eccentric merger. We also compute the GW signature of these mergers,
showing that they can enter the LISA band while eccentric.

slow compared to momentum-conserving ones. While the microscopic details
necessary to satisfy this condition are material-specific, experimentally
accessible current densities share remarkable similarities. We study the
dependence of electron hydrodynamic flows on the rates of momentum-relaxing and
momentum-conserving scattering processes in a microscopics-agnostic way. We
develop a framework for generating random collision operators which respect
crystal symmetries and conservation laws and which have a tunable ratio between
the momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing lifetimes. Using various random
instances of these collision operators, we calculate macroscopic electron
viscosity tensors and solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in a channel
geometry over a grid of momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing lifetimes,
and for different crystal symmetry groups. We find that different random
collision operators using the same lifetimes produce very similar current
density profiles, meaning that the current density is primarily a probe of the
overall rates of momentum conservation and relaxation. By contrast, the
viscosity tensor varies substantially at fixed lifetimes, meaning that
properties like channel resistance provide detailed probes of the underlying
scattering processes. This suggests that, while details of the scattering
process are imprinted in the electronic viscosity tensor, for many applications
theoretical calculations of hydrodynamic electron flows can use
experimentally-available lifetimes within a spatially-resolved BTE framework
rather than requiring the costly computation of ab initio collision operators.

Therefore, to elucidate the nature of solar flares, it is critical to estimate

helicity, a measure of the twist of coronal magnetic structures, is thus used

numerically and analytically for different parameter regimes. This allows us to
extract the full temperature and chemical potential dependence of the transport
coefficients. In particular, we uncover that the diffusivity matrix takes on a
simple form in various limits and leads to simplified Einstein relations. At
low temperatures, we also recover a previously known result for the
Wiedemann-Franz ratio. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between
diffusion and quantum chaos by showing that the diffusivity eigenvalues are
upper bounded by the chaos propagation rate at all temperatures. Our work
showcases an important example of an analytically tractable calculation of
transport properties in a strongly interacting quantum system and reveals a
more general purpose method for addressing strongly coupled transport.

develop a method that can localize the origin of variability on the sky to
better than one fifth of a pixel. Given measured frequencies of observed
variability (e.g., from periodogram analysis), we show that the corresponding
best-fit sinusoid amplitudes to raw light curves extracted from each pixel are
distributed the same as light from the variable source. The primary assumption
of this method is that other nearby stars are not variable at the same
frequencies. Essentially, we are using the high frequency resolution of TESS to
overcome limitations from its low spatial resolution. We have implemented our
method in an open source Python package, TESS Localize
(github.com/Higgins00/TESS-Localize), that determines the location of a
variable source on the sky given TESS pixel data and a set of observed
frequencies of variability. Our method utilizes the TESS Pixel Response

isolated galaxies in the xCOLD GASS sample, our group galaxies tend to have low
star formation rates and low H2 gas fractions. Our findings suggest that the
group environment can change the distribution of cold gas components, including
the molecular gas, and star formation properties of galaxies. This is
supporting evidence that pre-processing in the group-like environment can play

  3. The performances of methods are highly dependent on the selection
criterion. When the signal sizes are small, the methods using the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) have better performances. And when the signal sizes
are large enough, the methods using the phylogenetic Bayesian information
criterion (pBIC) (Khabbazian et al., 2016) have better performance. Moreover,
the performance is heavily impacted by measurement error and tree

PhylogeneticEM is even more conservative with small signal sizes and falls

fluids as it deforms in the presence of continuous horizontal air jet. Such a
fragmentation typically occurs after the bulk liquid has disintegrated upon
exiting the atomizer and is in the form of an ensemble of drops which undergo
further breakup. The drop deformation and its eventual disintegration is
important in evaluating the efficacy of a particular industrial process, be it
combustion in automobile engines or pesticide spraying in agricultural
applications. The interplay between competing influences of surface tension and
aerodynamic disruptive forces is represented by the Weber number, $We$, and
Ohnesorge number, $Oh$, and used to describe the breakup morphology. The
breakup pattern considered in our study corresponds to that of a bag attached
to a toroidal ring which occurs from $12 < We < 16$. We aim to address several
issues connected with this breakup process and their dependence on $We$ and
$Oh$ which have been hitherto unexplored. The $We$ boundary at which breakup
begins is theoretically determined and the expression obtained, $We = 12(1 +
2/3Oh^2)$, is found to match well with experimental data available in
literature. An exponential growth in the radial extent of the deformed drop and
the streamline dimension of the bag is predicted by a theoretical model and
confirmed by experimental findings. These quantities are observed to strongly

translating unique nanoscale properties to the macroscale. One emerging example
is graphene oxide (GO) membranes for separation processes. Thus, here we
investigate how individual GO properties can impact layered GO characteristics
and water permeability. GO chemistry and morphology were controlled with
easy-to-implement photo-reduction and sonication techniques and were
quantitatively correlated offering a valuable tool to speed up the
characterization process. For example, one could perform chemical analysis and
concurrently obtain morphology information or vice versa. Chemical GO
modification allows for fine control of GO oxidation state and GO laminate
nanoarchitecture enabling controlled synthesis of a GO architectural laminate
(GOAL). The GOAL can be considered as the selective layer of the membrane
created by interconnected sub-nanometer channels, characterized by a length and
a height (i.e., GO spacing), through which water molecules permeate. Water
permeability was measured for eight GOAL characterized by different GO
chemistry and morphology, and indicate that GO nanochannel height dictates
water transport. The simulations indicate a no-slip Darcy-like water transport
regime inside the GOAL due to the presence of basal oxygen functionalities. The
experimental and simulation evidence presented in this letter help create a
clearer picture of water transport in GO and can be used to rationally design
more effective and efficient GO membranes.

uncertainty quantification and machine learning, but its successful application
depends strongly on the accuracy and reliability of the resulting PCE-based
response surface. High accuracy typically requires high polynomial degrees,
demanding many training points especially in high-dimensional problems through
the curse of dimensionality. So-called sparse PCE concepts work with a much
smaller selection of basis polynomials compared to conventional PCE approaches
and can overcome the curse of dimensionality very efficiently, but have to pay
specific attention to their strategies of choosing training points.
Furthermore, the approximation error resembles an uncertainty that most
existing PCE-based methods do not estimate. In this study, we develop and
evaluate a fully Bayesian approach to establish the PCE representation via
joint shrinkage priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo. The suggested Bayesian PCE
model directly aims to solve the two challenges named above: achieving a sparse
PCE representation and estimating uncertainty of the PCE itself. The embedded
Bayesian regularizing via the joint shrinkage prior allows using higher
polynomial degrees for given training points due to its ability to handle
underdetermined situations, where the number of considered PCE coefficients
could be much larger than the number of available training points. We also
explore multiple variable selection methods to construct sparse PCE expansions
based on the established Bayesian representations, while globally selecting the
most meaningful orthonormal polynomials given the available training data. We
demonstrate the advantages of our Bayesian PCE and the corresponding
sparsity-inducing methods on several benchmarks.

provide bounds on the possible benefit a signalling policy can provide with and

revealing information can reduce system cost in some settings, it can also be
detrimental and cause worse performance than not signalling at all. However, by
utilizing both signalling and incentive mechanisms, the system operator can
guarantee that revealing information does not worsen performance while offering
similar opportunities for improvement. These findings emerge from the closed
form bounds we derive on the benefit a signalling policy can provide. We
provide a numerical example which illustrates the phenomenon that revealing
more information can degrade performance when incentives are not used and
improves performance when incentives are used.

(inertial flat case), the spinning cosmic string (CS) spacetime (inertial
curved case), and the spinning CS spacetime with noninertial effects
(noninertial curved case). In particular, in the first two scenarios, we have
an inertial frame, while in the third, we have a rotating frame. With respect
to bound-state solutions, we focus primarily on eigenfunctions (Dirac spinor
and wave function) and on energy eigenvalues (Landau levels), where we use the
flat and curved Dirac equation in polar coordinates to reach such solutions.

could confound the findings. We explored the possibility of reversing food
craving preference using psychophysical tasks on human participants considering
their individual food preferences in a multisensory food exposure set-up.
Participants were grouped into Positive Control (PC), Negative Control (NC),
and Neutral Control (NEC) based on their preference for sweet and savory items.
Participants reported their momentary craving of the displayed food stimuli
through desire scale and bidding scale (willingness to pay) pre and post
multisensory exposure. Participants were exposed to food items they either
liked or disliked. Our results asserted the effect of the multisensory food
exposure showing statistically significant increase in food craving for
negative control post-exposure to disliked food items.
  Using computational model and statistical methods we also show that desire
for food does not necessarily translate to willingness to pay every time and
instantaneous subjective valuation of food craving is an important parameter
for subsequent action.
  Our results further demonstrate the role of parietal N200 and centro-parietal

landscapes of many complex variables. Unlike real landscapes, the
classification of saddles by index is trivial. Instead, the spectrum of
fluctuations at stationary points determines their topological stability under
analytic continuation of the theory. Topological changes, which occur at
so-called Stokes points, proliferate among saddles with marginal (flat)
directions and are suppressed otherwise. This gives a direct interpretation of
the gap or 'threshold' energy -- which in the real case separates saddles from
minima -- as the level where the spectrum of the hessian matrix of stationary
points develops a gap. This leads to different consequences for the analytic
continuation of real landscapes with different structures: the global minima of
'one step replica-symmetry broken' landscapes lie beyond a threshold, their
hessians are gapped, and are locally protected from Stokes points, whereas
those of 'many step replica-symmetry broken' have gapless hessians and Stokes
points immediately proliferate. A new matrix ensemble is found, playing the
role that GOE plays for real landscapes in determining the topological nature
of saddles.

with the advent of networks supporting 25-100 Gb/s and storage devices
delivering 1, 000, 000 reqs/sec, the CPU has become the bottleneck trying to
keep up feeding data in and out of these fast devices. The result is that data
access libraries executed on single clients are often CPU-bound and cannot
utilize the scale-out benefits of distributed storage systems. One attractive
solution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering
tasks to the storage layer. However, modifying legacy storage systems to
support compute offloading is often tedious and requires an extensive
understanding of the system internals. Previous approaches re-implemented
functionality of data processing frameworks and access libraries for a

  This paper presents PaC-trees, a purely-functional data structure supporting
functional interfaces for sets, maps, and sequences that provides a significant
reduction in space over existing approaches. A PaC-tree is a balanced binary
search tree which blocks the leaves and compresses the blocks using arrays. We
provide novel techniques for compressing and uncompressing the blocks which
yield practical parallel functional algorithms for a broad set of operations on

which are both theoretically and practically efficient.
  Using PaC-trees we designed CPAM, a C++ library that implements the full

compression. CPAM consistently matches or outperforms PAM on a set of

direct and indirect detection constraints. We have found that the LSP dark

the MSSM in terms of dark matter properties as $\lambda$ and $\kappa$ are very
small. The LSP can also be either higgsino-dominated or bino-dominated in some
parameter space. The most important parameters affecting the mass and

lobes of non-central galaxies are generally not detectable, we use Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope 610~MHz observations to identify jet sources and
estimate their size, and Chandra data to estimate the pressure of the
surrounding ICM. In the radio, we detect 4.5% of galaxies above the
spectroscopic survey limit (M*K+2.0) of the Arizona cluster redshift survey
(ACReS) which covers five of our six clusters. Approximately one tenth of these
are extended radio sources. Using star formation (SF) rates determined from
mid-infrared data, we estimate the expected contribution to radio luminosity
from the stellar population of each galaxy, and find that most of the
unresolved or poorly-resolved radio sources are likely star formation
dominated. The relatively low frequency and good spatial resolution of our
radio data allows us to trace star formation emission down to galaxies of
stellar mass ~10^9.5 Msol. We estimate the enthalpy of the (AGN dominated)
jet/lobe and tailed sources, and place limits on the energy available from
unresolved radio jets. We find jet powers in the range ~10^43-10^46 erg/s,
comparable to those of brightest cluster galaxies. Our results suggest that
while cluster-central sources are the dominant factor balancing ICM cooling
over the long term, non-central sources may have a significant impact, and that

Specifically, we found that increase in the growth temperature leads to
increase in the elastic moduli and hardness of the films. The relative porosity
in the films also increases while the a-SiO2 network itself becomes denser,
resulting in an overall increase in density despite increased porosity. In
addition, we found that the a-SiO2 films exhibit the same anomalous temperature

  Gaussian Mechanisms",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a trained model and a data sample, membership-inference (MI) attacks
predict whether the sample was in the model's training set. A common
countermeasure against MI attacks is to utilize differential privacy (DP)
during model training to mask the presence of individual examples. While this
use of DP is a principled approach to limit the efficacy of MI attacks, there
is a gap between the bounds provided by DP and the empirical performance of MI
attacks. In this paper, we derive bounds for the \textit{advantage} of an
adversary mounting a MI attack, and demonstrate tightness for the widely-used
Gaussian mechanism. We further show bounds on the \textit{confidence} of MI
attacks. Our bounds are much stronger than those obtained by DP analysis. For
example, analyzing a setting of DP-SGD with $\epsilon=4$ would obtain an upper
bound on the advantage of $\approx0.36$ based on our analyses, while getting
bound of $\approx 0.97$ using the analysis of previous work that convert
$\epsilon$ to membership inference bounds.
  Finally, using our analysis, we provide MI metrics for models trained on
CIFAR10 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
state-of-the-art membership inference bounds for the privacy.

increasingly popular choice as the detection algorithm for Network-based
Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes). Unfortunately, DL algorithms are
vulnerable to adversarial examples that inject imperceptible modifications to
the input and cause the DL algorithm to misclassify the input. Existing
adversarial attacks in the NIDS domain often manipulate the traffic features
directly, which hold no practical significance because traffic features cannot
be replayed in a real network. It remains a research challenge to generate
practical and evasive adversarial attacks.
  This paper presents the Liuer Mihou attack that generates practical and
replayable adversarial network packets that can bypass anomaly-based NIDS
deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The core idea behind Liuer
Mihou is to exploit adversarial transferability and generate adversarial
packets on a surrogate NIDS constrained by predefined mutation operations to
ensure practicality. We objectively analyse the evasiveness of Liuer Mihou
against four ML-based algorithms (LOF, OCSVM, RRCF, and SOM) and the
state-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune. From the results of our experiment, we gain
valuable insights into necessary conditions on the adversarial transferability
of anomaly detection algorithms. Going beyond a theoretical setting, we replay
the adversarial attack in a real IoT testbed to examine the practicality of
Liuer Mihou. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing feature-level
adversarial defence cannot defend against Liuer Mihou and constructively
criticise the limitations of feature-level adversarial defences.

framework for efficient and reliable Hardware Trojan (HT) detection. HT is a
backdoor attack that tampers with the design of victim integrated circuits

scalability and accuracy of detecting smaller Trojans in the presence of noise
and variations. To achieve high trigger coverage, AdaTest leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce a diverse set of test inputs.
Particularly, we progressively generate test vectors with high reward values in
an iterative manner. In each iteration, the test set is evaluated and
adaptively expanded as needed. Furthermore, AdaTest integrates adaptive
sampling to prioritize test samples that provide more information for HT
detection, thus reducing the number of samples while improving the sample
quality for faster exploration. We develop AdaTest with a Software/Hardware
co-design principle and provide an optimized on-chip architecture solution.
AdaTest's architecture minimizes the hardware overhead in two ways:(i)
Deploying circuit emulation on programmable hardware to accelerate reward
evaluation of the test input; (ii) Pipelining each computation stage in AdaTest
by automatically constructing auxiliary circuit for test input generation,
reward evaluation, and adaptive sampling. We evaluate AdaTest's performance on
various HT benchmarks and compare it with two prior works that use logic
testing for HT detection. Experimental results show that AdaTest engenders up
to two orders of test generation speedup and two orders of test set size
reduction compared to the prior works while achieving the same level or higher
Trojan detection rate.

dark energy for its explanation if general relativity is an accurate model of
gravity. However, dark energy is a mysterious quantity and we do not know much
about its nature so understanding dark energy is an exciting scientific
challenge. Cosmological dark energy models are fairly well tested in the low
and high redshift parts of the universe. The highest of the low redshift,
$z\sim2.3$, region is probed by baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements
and the only high redshift probe is the cosmic microwave background anisotropy
which probes the $z\sim1100$ part of redshift space. In the intermediate
redshift range $2.3 < z < 1100$ there are only a handful of observational
probes and cosmological models are poorly tested in this region.
  In this thesis we constrain three pairs of general relativistic cosmological
dark energy models using observational data which reach beyond the current BAO
limit. We use quasar X-ray and UV flux measurements, the current version of
these data span $0.009 \leq z \leq 7.5413$. We have discovered that most of
these data cannot be standardized using the proposed method. However, the lower
redshift part, $z \lesssim 1.5-1.7$, of these data are standardizable and can
be used to derive lower-$z$ cosmological constraints. Another data set we use
are gamma-ray burst measurements which span $0.3399 \leq z \leq 8.2$.
Cosmological constraints derived from these data are significantly weaker than,
but consistent with, those obtained from better-established cosmological
probes. We also study and standardize 78 reverberation-measured Mg II time-lag
quasars in the redshift range $0.0033 \leq z \leq 1.89$ by using their
radius-luminosity relation. We also study 118 reverberation-measured H$\beta$

to understand the creditworthiness assessment performance dynamics and how it

allow us to characterize each borrower according to their credit behavior, and

stabilizes. The most notable effect on perfomance of social networks features
occurs at loan application; in personal scoring, this effect prevails a few

category generalize with respect to two parameters: the dimension n of the
things which compose, and the position i of the thing which is the result of
the composition. In the nerve of a small category, the dimension of the things
which compose (maps) is n=1. Compositions are 2-simplices (commutative
triangles) in which the position of the composite is the 1-simplex opposite
vertex i=1. These conditions generalize to all n>1 and i in {0 , ... , n+1}. We
call such a simplicial set an (n,i)-composer. This paper explores two aspects
of composers: models and the algebra of such generalized composition.
  Models: we develop a family of set-based models for composers analogous to
sets-and-functions models for ordinary categories. The key to obtaining
set-based models of (n,i)-composers is to observe that in the nerve of a
category of sets-and-functions, a 1-simplex is a binary relation with certain
properties on its two faces, that is, its codomain and domain. In a model of an
(n,i)-composer, each k-simplex is a (k+1)-ary relation on its faces having
certain properties, with special attention to k=n (things which compose) and
k=n+1 (a composition of things). The development of these models is guided by
requiring: (i) the usual sets-and-functions model, i.e. when n=1 and i=1,
belongs to the family; (ii) the things which compose have properties which
resemble and generalize properties possessed by ordinary functions.
  Algebra: we explore some notions which are inspired by the algebra of
ordinary composition. These include ""comma-composers"" generalizing comma
categories, a composer structure for function complexes, representables, and a
generalization of universal map. In its current form, this part of the paper is
provisional in content and organization.

produced in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions to obtain 3D isotopic
distributions within an object. The locations of the inelastic scattering
centers are calculated by measuring the arrival time and the position of the
associated particle, the alpha particle in the fusion reaction, and the arrival
time of the prompt gamma created in the scattering event. While the neutron and
its associated particle move in opposite directions in the center-of-mass (COM)
system, in the laboratory system the angle is slightly less than 180 degrees,
and the COM movement must be taken into account in the reconstruction of the
scattering location. Furthermore, due to energy loss of ions in the target, the
fusion reactions are produced by ions of different energies, and thus the COM
velocity varies, resulting in an uncertainty in the reconstructed positions. In
this paper, we analyze the COM corrections to this reconstruction by simulating
the energy loss of beam ions in the target material and identifying sources of
uncertainty in these corrections. We show that an average COM velocity can be
used in the reconstruction and discuss errors as a function of ion beam energy,
composition, and alpha detection location. When accounting for the COM effect,
the mean of the reconstructed locations can be considered a systematic error
leading to shift/tilt in the reconstruction. However, the distribution of
reconstructed locations also have a spread that will introduce an error in the
reconstruction that cannot be corrected. In this paper, we will use the known
stopping powers of ions in materials and reaction cross-sections to examine
this effect.

invaluable tools for studying photoexcited dynamics due to their sensitivity to
carrier occupations and local chemical or structural changes. One of the most
studied mate-rials using transient XUV spectroscopy is $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$
because of its rich photoexcited dynamics, including small polaron formation.
The interpretation of carrier and polaron effects in $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is
currently done using a semi-empirical method that is not transferrable to most
materials. Here, an ab initio, Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach is
developed that can incorporate photoexcited state effects for arbitrary
materials systems. The accuracy of this approach is proven by calculating the
XUV absorption spectra for the ground, photoexcited, and polaron states of
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. Furthermore, the theoretical approach allows for the
projection of the core-valence excitons and different components of the X-ray
transition Hamiltonian onto the band structure, providing new insights into old
measurements. From this information, a physical intuition about the origins and
nature of the transient XUV spectra can be built. A route to extracting
electron and hole energies is even shown possible for highly angular momentum
split XUV peaks. This method is easily generalized to K, L, M, and N edges to
provide a general approach for analyzing transient X-ray absorption or
reflection data.

PLM models in terms of the Impossible Triangle: 1) moderate model size, 2)

PLMs, various techniques have been proposed, such as knowledge distillation,
data augmentation and prompt learning, which inevitably brings additional work

companion masses $M_2$ $\lesssim 0.05\,\rm M_\odot$, which can be used to study
the accretion history and the radiation of pulsars, as well as the origin of
isolated MSPs. Recent observations indicate that there are two sub-types of
BWs. One is the BWs with $M_2$ $\sim$ $0.01-0.05\,\rm M_\odot$, whereas another
with $M_2$ $\lesssim 0.01\,\rm M_\odot$. However, the origin of the latter is
still highly uncertain. In this paper, we investigated the formation of BWs
with $M_2$ $\lesssim 0.01\,\rm M_\odot$ through ultra-compact X-ray binaries
(UCXBs) with He star companions, in which a neutron star (NS) accretes material
from a He star through Roche-lobe overflow. By considering different He star
masses and evaporation efficiencies with the stellar evolution code Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we evolved a series of NS+He star
systems that can undergo UCXB stage. We found that this channel can explain the
formation of BWs with $M_2$ $\lesssim 0.01\,\rm M_\odot$ within the Hubble
time, especially three widely studied BWs, i.e. PSRs J1719-1438, J2322-2650 and
J1311-3430. We also found that X-ray irradiation feedback does not affect the
evolutionary tracks of evaporation process. Our simulations indicate that the
UCXB channel with He star companions are the potential progenitors of isolated
MSPs, and that the origin of BWs with $M_2$ $\lesssim 0.01\,\rm M_\odot$ is
different with another sub-type of BWs. In addition, the present work suggests
that the BWs with $M_2$ $\lesssim 0.01\,\rm M_\odot$ may not be produced by
redback systems.

reconnection and intermittent magnetic turbulence in coronal mass ejections in
the solar corona and solar wind via remote and in situ observations. The
signatures of turbulent magnetic reconnection, i.e., bifurcated current sheet,
reconnecting jet, parallel/anti-parallel Alfv\'en waves, and spiky dynamical
pressure pulse, as well as fully-developed Kolmogorov intermittent turbulence,
are detected at the leading edge of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection and
the interface region of two interplanetary magnetic flux ropes. Methods for
quantifying the degree of coherence, amplitude-phase synchronization, and
multifractality of nonlinear multiscale fluctuations are discussed. The
stochastic chaotic nature of Alfv\'en intermittent structures driven by
magnetic reconnection is determined by a complexity-entropy analysis. Next, we
discuss the theory of chaos, intermittency, and complexity for nonlinear
Alfv\'en waves, and parametric decay and modulational wave-wave interactions,
in the absence/presence of noise. The transition from order to chaos is studied
using the bifurcation diagram. Two types of plasma chaos are considered: type-I
Pomeau-Manneville intermittency and crisis-induced intermittency. The role of
transient structures known as chaotic saddles in deterministic and stochastic
chaos in plasmas is investigated. Alfv\'en complexity associated with
noise-induced intermittency, in the presence of multistability, is studied.

parametric regressions to machine learning algorithms. It can be challenging to
choose an approach, as it is impossible to know in advance which one is the

serve as simulators of strongly correlated systems and topological states of
matter. A fascinating example is to realize the Kitaev quantum spin liquid by
using ultracold polar molecules. However, although experimental implementation
of the Kitaev-type interaction was proposed, the stability of the Kitaev
quantum spin liquid has not been fully investigated thus far. Here we study a
quantum spin model with long-range angle-dependent Kitaev-type interactions
proposed for the polar molecules, by the pseudofermion functional
renormalization group method. We reveal that the ground state is magnetically
ordered in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic models regardless of the
spatial anisotropy of the interactions, while the isotropic case is most
frustrated and closest to the realization of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid.
Furthermore, by introducing a cutoff in the interaction range, we clarify how
the Kitaev quantum spin liquid is destroyed by the long-range interactions. The

We show a data-redundant countermeasure for NTT which offers two concurrent

full Dilithium signature sequence on a 667 MHz ARM Cortex-A9 processor
integrated in a Xilinx Zynq SoC. We perform a detailed EM fault-injection

10% of the injected faults become potentially exploitable. However, the
bit-sliced NTT design is able to catch the majority of these potentially
exploitable faults, even when the remainder of the Dilithium algorithm as well
as the control flow is left unprotected. To our knowledge, this is the first

the RMs, and the known pulsar positions and dispersion measures (DMs), to map
the projected parallel component of the Galactic magnetic field toward the
cluster. The $\langle B_{||}\rangle$ shows a rough gradient of
$\sim$6\,nG/arcsec ($\sim$160\,nG/parsec), or fractionally, a change of

Galactic magnetic field variability at sub-parsec scales. We also measured

likely a selection effect due to the high frequencies used in pulsar searches
to mitigate dispersion and scattering. The inferred pulsar luminosity function

model, we explore three techniques to maximally boost the performance of each
model size: 1) Use separate decoders for each sub-model while sharing the
encoders; 2) Use funnel-pooling to improve the encoder efficiency; 3) Balance
the size of causal and non-causal encoders to improve quality and fit
deployment constraints. Overall, the proposed large-medium model has 30%
smaller size and reduces power consumption by 33%, compared to the baseline
cascaded encoder model. The triple-size model that unifies the large, medium,
and small models achieves 37% total size reduction with minimal quality loss,
while substantially reducing the engineering efforts of having separate models.

  Interpolation",,,"10.1007/s11075-022-01352-5",,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A number of key scientific computing applications that are based upon
tensor-product grid constructions, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP)
and combustion simulations, require property-preserving interpolation.
Essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) interpolation is a classic example of such
interpolation schemes. In the aforementioned application areas, property
preservation often manifests itself as a requirement for either data
boundedness or positivity preservation. For example, in NWP, one may have to
interpolate between the grid on which the dynamics is calculated to a grid on
which the physics is calculated (and back). Interpolating density or other key
physical quantities without accounting for property preservation may lead to
negative values that are nonphysical and result in inaccurate representations
and/or interpretations of the physical data. Property-preserving interpolation
is straightforward when used in the context of low-order numerical simulation
methods. High-order property-preserving interpolation is, however, nontrivial,
especially in the case where the interpolation points are not equispaced. In
this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct high-order
interpolation methods that ensure either data boundedness or constrained
positivity preservation. A novel feature of the algorithm is that the
positivity-preserving interpolant is constrained; that is, the amount by which
it exceeds the data values may be strictly controlled. The algorithm we have
developed comes with theoretical estimates that provide sufficient conditions
for data boundedness and constrained positivity preservation. We demonstrate
the application of our algorithm on a collection of 1D and 2D numerical
examples, and show that in all cases property preservation is respected.

framework aims at three goals: (1) inter-device communication to enable
high-quality predictions, (2) scalability to an arbitrary number of devices,
and (3) lifelong online learning to ensure adaptability to changing

largely task-agnostic - they augment a dataset using random image

ultimately benign for control. In contrast to prior work that synthesizes
adversarial examples for single-step vision tasks, our key contribution is to
synthesize adversarial scenarios tailored to multi-step, model-based control.
To do so, we use differentiable MPC methods to calculate the sensitivity of a

a non-parametric solution for domain adaptation in neural machine translation

in translating out-of-domain sentences by coordinating with an additional
token-level feature-based retrieval module constructed from in-domain data.
Previous studies have already demonstrated that non-parametric NMT is even
superior to models fine-tuned on out-of-domain data. In spite of this success,
kNN retrieval is at the expense of high latency, in particular for large
datastores. To make it practical, in this paper, we explore a more efficient
kNN-MT and propose to use clustering to improve the retrieval efficiency.
Concretely, we first propose a cluster-based Compact Network for feature
reduction in a contrastive learning manner to compress context features into
90+% lower dimensional vectors. We then suggest a cluster-based pruning
solution to filter out 10%-40% redundant nodes in large datastores while
retaining translation quality. Our proposed methods achieve better or
comparable performance while reducing up to 57% inference latency against the
advanced non-parametric MT model on several machine translation benchmarks.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods maintain the most
useful information of the original datastore and the Compact Network shows good
generalization on unseen domains.

over a separation range of 300-8900 au. The median separation of companions is
about 2100 au. The occurrence of stellar multiplicity may depend on the
physical characteristics of the dense cores. Notably, those containing
binary/multiple systems tend to show higher gas density and Mach number than
cores forming single stars. The integral-shaped filament (ISF) of Orion A giant
molecular cloud (GMC), which has the highest gas density and hosts high-mass
star formation in its central region (the Orion Nebula cluster), shows the
highest MF and CSF among the Orion GMCs. In contrast, the $\lambda$ Orionis

by the infeasibility. We study in the present work the convergence properties
of PALM-I. In particular, we construct a surrogate sequence to surmount the
nonmonotonicity issue and devise an implementable inexact criterion. Based upon
these, we manage to establish the stationarity of any accumulation point and,

conversation. Accurately predicting DAs can greatly facilitate the development
of dialog agents. Although researchers have done extensive research on dialog
act classification, the feature information of classification has not been
fully considered. This paper suggests that word cues, part-of-speech cues and
statistical cues can complement each other to improve the basis for
recognition. In addition, the different types of the three lead to the
diversity of their distribution forms, which hinders the mining of feature
information. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model based on
universality and individuality strategies, called Universality-Individuality
Integration Model (UIIM). UIIM not only deepens the connection between the
clues by learning universality, but also utilizes the learning of individuality
to capture the characteristics of the clues themselves. Experiments were made
over two most popular benchmark data sets SwDA and MRDA for dialogue act
classification, and the results show that extracting the universalities and
individualities between cues can more fully excavate the hidden information in
the utterance, and improve the accuracy of automatic dialogue act recognition.

Adaptation (PVDA) is a more general and practical scenario for cross-domain
video classification problems. The key challenge of PVDA is to mitigate the
negative transfer caused by the source-only outlier classes. To tackle this
challenge, a crucial step is to aggregate target predictions to assign class
weights by up-weighing target classes and down-weighing outlier classes.
However, the incorrect predictions of class weights can mislead the network and
lead to negative transfer. Previous works improve the class weight accuracy by
utilizing temporal features and attention mechanisms, but these methods may
fall short when trying to generate accurate class weight when domain shifts are
significant, as in most real-world scenarios. To deal with these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modality Cluster-calibrated partial Adversarial Network
(MCAN). MCAN enhances video feature extraction with multi-modal features from
multiple temporal scales to form more robust overall features. It utilizes a
novel class weight calibration method to alleviate the negative transfer caused
by incorrect class weights. The calibration method tries to identify and weigh
correct and incorrect predictions using distributional information implied by
unsupervised clustering. Extensive experiments are conducted on prevailing PVDA
benchmarks, and the proposed MCAN achieves significant improvements when
compared to state-of-the-art PVDA methods.

may not be possible to implement them successfully in the experiment. This
situation can be avoided if the entanglement is detected through the

Then we find some conditions on the parameters of the map for which the map
represent a positive map. Further, we have constructed a Choi matrix
corresponding to the map and have shown that it is not completely positive. We
then construct an entanglement witness operator, which is based on the linear
combination of the function of Choi matrix and the identity matrix and it can
detect both NPTES and PPTES. Finally, we prove its efficiency by detecting
several bipartite bound entangled states which were previously undetected by
some well-known separability criteria. We also compared the detection power of
our witness operator with three well-known powerful entanglement detection

sensors that can collect combined time of arrival (TOA), received signal
strength (RSS) and angle of arrival (AOA) measurements, the localization
accuracy can be enhanced further by optimally designing the placements of the
hybrid sensors. In this paper, we present an optimal sensor placement
methodology, which is based on the principle of majorization-minimization (MM),
for hybrid localization technique. We first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) of the hybrid measurement model, and formulate the design problem using
the A-optimal criterion. Next, we introduce an auxiliary variable to
reformulate the design problem into an equivalent saddle-point problem, and
then construct simple surrogate functions (having closed form solutions) over
both primal and dual variables. The application of MM in this paper is distinct
from the conventional MM (that is usually developed only over the primal
variable), and we believe that the MM framework developed in this paper can be
employed to solve many optimization problems. The main advantage of our method
over most of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms (which are mostly
analytical in nature) is its ability to work for both uncorrelated and
correlated noise in the measurements. We also discuss the extension of the
proposed algorithm for the optimal placement designs based on D and E optimal

first class comprises about 7 underluminous stars with smaller helium-burning

design of mechanical parts. However, existing TO algorithms use the Finite
Element Analysis (FEA) that requires massive computational resources. We
present a novel TO algorithm that incurs a much lower iterative cost. Unlike
conventional methods that require exact inversions of large FEA system matrices
at every iteration, we reformulate the problem as a bilevel optimization that
can be solved using a first-order algorithm and only inverts the system matrix
approximately. As a result, our method incurs a low iterative cost, and users
can preview the TO results interactively for fast design updates. Theoretical
convergence analysis and numerical experiments are conducted to verify our
effectiveness. We further discuss extensions to use high-performance
preconditioners and fine-grained parallelism on the Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU).

  problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The reconstruction of low-rank matrix from its noisy observation finds its
usage in many applications. It can be reformulated into a constrained nuclear
norm minimization problem, where the bound $\eta$ of the constraint is
explicitly given or can be estimated by the probability distribution of the
noise. When the Lagrangian method is applied to find the minimizer, the
solution can be obtained by the singular value thresholding operator where the
thresholding parameter $\lambda$ is related to the Lagrangian multiplier. In
this paper, we first show that the Frobenius norm of the discrepancy between
the minimizer and the observed matrix is a strictly increasing function of
$\lambda$. From that we derive a closed-form solution for $\lambda$ in terms of
$\eta$. The result can be used to solve the constrained nuclear-norm-type
minimization problem when $\eta$ is given. For the unconstrained
nuclear-norm-type regularized problems, our result allows us to automatically
choose a suitable regularization parameter by using the discrepancy principle.
The regularization parameters obtained are comparable to (and sometimes better
than) those obtained by Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE) approach while
the cost of solving the minimization problem can be reduced by 11--18 times.
Numerical experiments with both synthetic data and real MRI data are performed
to validate the proposed approach.

to endure noises that have been continuously thwarting their robustness.
Data-end defense, which improves robustness by operations on input data instead
of modifying models, has attracted intensive attention due to its feasibility
in practice. However, previous data-end defenses show low generalization
against diverse noises and weak transferability across multiple models.
Motivated by the fact that robust recognition depends on both local and global
features, we propose a defensive patch generation framework to address these
problems by helping models better exploit these features. For the
generalization against diverse noises, we inject class-specific identifiable
patterns into a confined local patch prior, so that defensive patches could
preserve more recognizable features towards specific classes, leading models
for better recognition under noises. For the transferability across multiple
models, we guide the defensive patches to capture more global feature
correlations within a class, so that they could activate model-shared global
perceptions and transfer better among models. Our defensive patches show great
potentials to improve application robustness in practice by simply sticking
them around target objects. Extensive experiments show that we outperform
others by large margins (improve 20+\% accuracy for both adversarial and
corruption robustness on average in the digital and physical world). Our codes

optical spectrum. At the single particle level, the shift of the plasmon peak
position with hydrogen concentration (i.e., the ""optical"" sensitivity) is
approximately constant at 180 nm/c_H for nanodisk diameters >~ 100 nm. For
smaller particles, the optical sensitivity is negative and increases with
decreasing diameter, due to the emergence of a second peak originating from
coupling between a localized surface plasmon and interband transitions. In
addition to tracking peak position, the onset of extinction as well as
extinction at fixed wavelengths is considered. We carefully compare the

discrepancies. Invariably, the results suggest that there is an upper bound for
the optical sensitivity that cannot be overcome by engineering composition

felt} by both the charged and neutral particles simultaneously. The resulting
neutral-mass loading of the ions leads to the rescaling of the effective
ion-cyclotron frequency-it becomes the Hall frequency, and the resultant
effective Larmor radius becomes of the order of few kms. Thus the finite Larmor
radius (FLR) effect which manifests as the ion and neutral pressure stress
tensors operates over macroscopic scales. Whereas parallel and perpendicular
(with respect to the magnetic field) viscous momentum transport competes with
the Ohm and Hall diffusion of the magnetic field in the
photosphere-chromosphre, the gyroviscous effect becomes important only in the
transition region between the chromosphere and corona, where it competes with
the ambipolar diffusion. The wave propagation in the gyroviscous effect
dominated medium depends on the plasma $\beta$ (a ratio of the thermal and
magnetic energies). The abundance of free energy makes gyro waves unstable with
the onset condition exactly opposite of the Hall instability. However, the
maximum growth rate is identical to the Hall instability. For a flow gradient
$\sim 0.1 \,\mbox{s}^{-1}$ the instability growth time is one minute. Thus, the
transition region may become subject to this fast growing, gyroviscous

adaptive sampling space can greatly improve the successful sampling rate of RRT
(the ratio of the number of samples successfully added to the RRT tree to the

ultracold atoms in optical lattices. In particular, the mixing of orbitals with
distinct parity representations, such as $s$ and $p$ orbitals, has been shown
to be especially useful for generating systems that require alternating phase
patterns, as with the sign of couplings within a lattice. Here we show that by
further breaking the symmetries of such mixed-orbital lattices, it is possible
to generate synthetic magnetic flux threading the lattice. This capability
allows the generation of multipole higher-order topological phases in synthetic
bosonic platforms, in which $\pi$ flux threading each plaquette of the lattice
is required, and which to date have only been implemented using tailored

quadrupole photonic topological insulator in a two-dimensional lattice of
waveguides that leverage modes with both $s$ and $p$ orbital-type

observing the presence of protected zero-dimensional states, which are
spatially confined to the corners, and by confirming that these states sit at

  using x-ray spectroscopy",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A gas cell for in-situ measurements of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and
their adsorption behavior on different surfaces by means of X-Ray Fluorescence
(XRF) and X-ray Absorption Fine-Structure (XAFS) spectroscopy has been
developed. The cell is especially designed to allow for the efficient
excitation and detection of low-Z elements such as carbon, oxygen or nitrogen
as main components of VOCs. Two measurement modes are available. In the surface
mode, adsorption on a surface can be studied using XAFS by fluorescence
detection under shallow angles of incidence. The transmission mode enables the
simultaneous investigation of gaseous samples via XAFS in transmittance and
fluorescence detection modes. Proof-of-principle experiments were performed at
the PTB plane grating monochromator beamline for soft x-ray radiation at the
synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II. The flexible design and high
versatility of the cell are demonstrated with the investigation of ethanol
(EtOH) as one of the most abundant VOCs. The comparison of Near-Edge X-ray
Absorption Fine-Structure (NEXAFS) spectra under transmission and fluorescence
detection in the gas phase with measurements of adsorbed molecules on a
Si-wafer surface both at the C and O-K absorption edges proves the
applicability of the cell for the monitoring of adsorption processes.

systems of various types. Recently, a new partition refinement algorithm and
associated tool CoPaR were developed that are generic in the transition type of
the input system and match the theoretical run time of the best known
algorithms for many concrete system types. Genericity is achieved by modelling
transition types as functors on sets and systems as coalgebras. Experimentation
has shown that memory consumption is a bottleneck for handling systems with a
large state space, while running times are fast. We have therefore extended an
algorithm due to Blom and Orzan, which is suitable for a distributed
implementation to the coalgebraic level of genericity, and implemented it in
CoPaR. Experiments show that this allows to handle much larger state spaces.
Running times are low in most experiments, but there is a significant penalty

sudden changes in the availability of resources or unexpected user behavior.
Without proper mitigation these uncertainties can jeopardize the system goals.
Self-adaptation is a common approach to tackle such uncertainties. When the
system goals may be compromised, the self-adaptive system has to select the
best adaptation option to reconfigure by analyzing the possible adaptation
options, i.e., the adaptation space. Yet, analyzing large adaptation spaces
using rigorous methods can be resource- and time-consuming, or even be
infeasible. One approach to tackle this problem is by using online machine
learning to reduce adaptation spaces. However, existing approaches require
domain expertise to perform feature engineering to define the learner, and
support online adaptation space reduction only for specific goals. To tackle
these limitations, we present 'Deep Learning for Adaptation Space Reduction
Plus' -- DLASeR+ in short. DLASeR+ offers an extendable learning framework for
online adaptation space reduction that does not require feature engineering,
while supporting three common types of adaptation goals: threshold,
optimization, and set-point goals. We evaluate DLASeR+ on two instances of an
Internet-of-Things application with increasing sizes of adaptation spaces for
different combinations of adaptation goals. We compare DLASeR+ with a baseline
that applies exhaustive analysis and two state-of-the-art approaches for
adaptation space reduction that rely on learning. Results show that DLASeR+ is
effective with a negligible effect on the realization of the adaptation goals

stochastic program filter, the measurement times are given by a policy that
determines whether a measurement should be taken based on the measurements
already acquired. The second, called the offline filter, determines all
measurement times at once by solving a combinatorial optimization program

building on well established results for quantum Hall states, using

intrinsic spatial curvature. This phenomenon is characterized by a
topologically quantized coupling constant. Remarkably, the charge-gravity
relationship remains linear in the curvature, up to the maximum curvature
achievable on the lattice, demonstrating absence of higher order nonlinear
response. Our findings facilitate articulating the physical principles
underlying the topological quantization of the gravitational coupling constant,
in analogy with the insights offered by the Chern number description of the

cloud scenes according to a free-form language description. Previous methods
mostly follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e., language-irrelevant detection and
cross-modal matching, which is limited by the isolated architecture. In such a
paradigm, the detector needs to sample keypoints from raw point clouds due to
the inherent properties of 3D point clouds (irregular and large-scale), to
generate the corresponding object proposal for each keypoint. However, sparse
proposals may leave out the target in detection, while dense proposals may
confuse the matching model. Moreover, the language-irrelevant detection stage
can only sample a small proportion of keypoints on the target, deteriorating
the target prediction. In this paper, we propose a 3D Single-Stage Referred
Point Progressive Selection (3D-SPS) method, which progressively selects
keypoints with the guidance of language and directly locates the target.
Specifically, we propose a Description-aware Keypoint Sampling (DKS) module to
coarsely focus on the points of language-relevant objects, which are
significant clues for grounding. Besides, we devise a Target-oriented
Progressive Mining (TPM) module to finely concentrate on the points of the
target, which is enabled by progressive intra-modal relation modeling and
inter-modal target mining. 3D-SPS bridges the gap between detection and
matching in the 3D visual grounding task, localizing the target at a single
stage. Experiments demonstrate that 3D-SPS achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets.

developed with certain assumptions defined in their respective threat models.
However, the robustness of these countermeasures is inadvertently ignored,
which can introduce severe consequences, e.g., a countermeasure can be misused
and result in a false implication of backdoor detection.
  For the first time, we critically examine the robustness of existing backdoor
countermeasures with an initial focus on three influential model-inspection
ones that are Neural Cleanse (S&P'19), ABS (CCS'19), and MNTD (S&P'21).
Although the three countermeasures claim that they work well under their
respective threat models, they have inherent unexplored non-robust cases
depending on factors such as given tasks, model architectures, datasets, and
defense hyper-parameter, which are \textit{not even rooted from delicate
adaptive attacks}. We demonstrate how to trivially bypass them aligned with
their respective threat models by simply varying aforementioned factors.
Particularly, for each defense, formal proofs or empirical studies are used to
reveal its two non-robust cases where it is not as robust as it claims or
expects, especially the recent MNTD. This work highlights the necessity of
thoroughly evaluating the robustness of backdoor countermeasures to avoid their

In this framework, an adversary changes the input to the regression model in
order to maximize the prediction error. We provide bounds on the prediction
error in the presence of an adversary as a function of the parameter norm and
the error in the absence of such an adversary. We show how these bounds make it
possible to study the adversarial error using analysis from non-adversarial
setups. The obtained results shed light on the robustness of overparameterized
linear models to adversarial attacks. Adding features might be either a source
of additional robustness or brittleness. On the one hand, we use asymptotic
results to illustrate how double-descent curves can be obtained for the
adversarial error. On the other hand, we derive conditions under which the
adversarial error can grow to infinity as more features are added, while at the
same time, the test error goes to zero. We show this behavior is caused by the
fact that the norm of the parameter vector grows with the number of features.
It is also established that $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$-adversarial attacks
might behave fundamentally differently due to how the $\ell_1$ and
$\ell_2$-norms of random projections concentrate. We also show how our
reformulation allows for solving adversarial training as a convex optimization
problem. This fact is then exploited to establish similarities between
adversarial training and parameter-shrinking methods and to study how the
training might affect the robustness of the estimated models.

describe deviations from homogeneity in filter media. We suggest to derive the
cloudiness index from the power spectrum of the relative local areal weight,
integrated over a selected frequency range. The power spectrum captures the
energy density in a broad spectral range. Moreover, under certain conditions,
the structure of a nonwoven is fully characterized by the areal weight, the
variance of the local areal weight, and the power spectrum. Consequently, the
power spectrum is the parameter that exclusively reflects the cloudiness. Here,
we address questions arising from practical application. The most prominent is
the choice of the spectral band. It certainly depends on the characteristic
""size of the clouds"", but is limited by the size and lateral resolution of the
images. We show that the cloudiness index based on the power spectrum of the
relative local areal weight is theoretically well founded and can be robustly
measured from image data. Choosing the spectral band allows to capture the
cloudiness either visually perceived or found to be decisive for product
properties. It is thus well suited to build a technical standard on it.

  In general, modelling preferences are consistent across the two paradigms.
When presented with location information, participants preferred to create
nodes to represent cities, rather than use metadata; although the preference
was less marked for Cypher. In Cypher, participants showed little difference in
preference between representing dates or population size as nodes. In RDF*,
this choice was not necessary since both could be represented as literals.
However, there was a significant preference for using the date as metadata to
describe a triple containing population size, rather than vice versa. There was
no significant difference overall in accuracy of interpretation of queries in
the two paradigms; although in one specific case, the use of a reverse arrow in
Cypher was interpreted significantly more accurately than the ^ symbol in
SPARQL. Based on our results and on the comments of participants, we make some
recommendations for modellers.
  Techniques for reifing RDF have attracted a great deal of research. Recently,
a hybrid approach, employing some of the features of property graphs, has

As part of UNIONS, CFIS provides r-band data which we use to study weak-lensing

weak-lensing peak counts and their impact on cosmological parameters for the
UNIONS survey. In particular, we present results on local calibration,
metacalibration shear bias, baryonic feedback, the source galaxy redshift
estimate, intrinsic alignment, and the cluster member dilution. For each
uncertainty and systematic effect, we describe our mitigation scheme and the
impact on cosmological parameter constraints. We obtain constraints on
cosmological parameters from MCMC using CFIS data and MassiveNuS N-body
simulations as a model for peak counts statistics. Depending on the calibration
(local versus global, and the inclusion of the residual multiplicative shear
bias), the mean matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ can shift up to $-0.024$
($-0.5\sigma$). We also see that including baryonic corrections can shift
$\Omega_m$ by $+0.027$ ($+0.5 \sigma$) with respect to the DM-only simulations.
Reducing the impact of the intrinsic alignment and cluster member dilution
through signal-to-noise cuts can lead to a shift in $\Omega_m$ of $+0.027$
($+0.5 \sigma$). Finally, with a mean redshift uncertainty of $\Delta \bar{z} =
0.03$, we see that the shift of $\Omega_m$ ($+0.001$ which corresponds to
$+0.02 \sigma$) is not significant. This paper investigates for the first time
with UNIONS weak-lensing data and peak counts the impact of systematic effects.
The value of $\Omega_m$ is the most impacted and can shift up to $\sim 0.03$
which corresponds to $0.5\sigma$ depending on the choices for each systematics.
We expect constraints to become more reliable with future (larger) data
catalogues, for which the current pipeline will provide a starting point.

well a language model captures distinct linguistic skills essential for
language understanding and reasoning. Thus they fail to effectively map out the
aspects of language understanding that remain challenging to existing models,
which makes it hard to discover potential limitations in models and datasets.
In this paper, we introduce Curriculum as a new format of NLI benchmark for
evaluation of broad-coverage linguistic phenomena. Curriculum contains a
collection of datasets that covers 36 types of major linguistic phenomena and
an evaluation procedure for diagnosing how well a language model captures
reasoning skills for distinct types of linguistic phenomena. We show that this
linguistic-phenomena-driven benchmark can serve as an effective tool for
diagnosing model behavior and verifying model learning quality. In addition,
our experiments provide insight into the limitation of existing benchmark
datasets and state-of-the-art models that may encourage future research on
re-designing datasets, model architectures, and learning objectives.

flagship of nanofluidic discoveries in recent years. By confining liquids down
to a few atomic layers, anomalies in molecular transport and structure have
been revealed. Currently, only indirect and ensemble averaged techniques have
been able to operate in such extreme confinements, as even the smallest
molecular fluorophores are too bulky to penetrate state-of-the-art single-digit
nanofluidic systems. This strong limitation calls for the development of novel
optical approaches allowing for the direct molecular imaging of liquids
confined at the nanoscale. Here, we show that native defects present at the
surface of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) - a widely used 2D material - can
serve as probes for molecular sensing in liquid, without compromising the
atomic smoothness of their host material. We first demonstrate that native
surface defects are readily activated through interactions with organic
solvents and confirm their quantum emission properties. Vibrational spectra of
the emitters suggest that their activation occurs through the chemisorption of
carbon-bearing liquid molecules onto native hBN defects. The correlated
activation of neighboring defects reveals single-molecule dynamics at the
interface, while defect emission spectra offer a direct readout of the local
dielectric properties of the liquid medium. We then harvest these effects in
atomically smooth slit-shaped van der Waals channels, revealing molecular
dynamics and increasing dielectric order under nanometre-scale confinement.
Liquid-activated native defects in pristine hBN bridge the gap between
solid-state nanophotonics and nanofluidics and open up new avenues for
nanoscale sensing and optofluidics.

characteristics of the produced states of light are characterized by applying
the Duan criterion and the positivity under partial transposition criterion.
Moreover, by using an internal dressing field to modulate atomic coherence,
multiple quantum coherent channels of FWM are simultaneously constructed, which
result in a great extension of entanglement mode number and quantum information
capacity. We find that the violation of the entanglement criteria inequalities
is coherent-channel dependent, and the produced states can be directly
modulated via atomic coherence. Our system can integrate the generation and

However, they frequently cause loss of information, putting forward a crucial
trade-off among data quality and privacy. A clever way to bypass such a

learning the real data properties. Both Academia and Industry realized the
importance of evaluating synthetic data quality: without all-round reliable

DAISYnt on the different synthetic replicas. Further potential uses, among
others, entail auditing and fine-tuning of generative models or ensuring high

sequentially illuminated with intensity patterns: the total signal is summed

Because of measurement noise, the retrieved object differs from the ground
truth by some error quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In
situations where the noise only arises from the photon counting process, it has
not been made clear if single-pixel detection multiplexing leads to a better
SNR than simply scanning the object with a focused intensity spot - a modality

with certain types of single-pixel detection multiplexing, and compares it with
raster scanning. In particular, we show that, under photon noise, when the
positive intensity modulation is based on Hadamard or Cosine patterns,
single-pixel detection multiplexing does not systematically improve the SNR as

Monte Carlo computation. Models that involve discrete variables can sometime
pose a challenge, either because the methods used do not support such variables
(e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) or because the presence of such variables can
slow down the computation. A common workaround is to marginalise the discrete
variables out of the model. While it is reasonable to expect that such
marginalisation would also lead to more time-efficient computations, to our
knowledge this has not been demonstrated beyond a few specialised models.
  We explored the impact of marginalisation on the computational efficiency for
a few simple statistical models. Specifically, we considered two- and
three-component Gaussian mixture models, and also the Dawid-Skene model for
categorical ratings. We explored each with two software implementations of
Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques: JAGS and Stan. We directly compared
marginalised and non-marginalised versions of the same model using the samplers
on the same software.
  Our results show that marginalisation on its own does not necessarily boost
performance. Nevertheless, the best performance was usually achieved with Stan,
which requires marginalisation. We conclude that there is no simple answer to
whether or not marginalisation is helpful. It is not necessarily the case that,
when turned 'on', this technique can be assured to provide computational
benefit independent of other factors, nor is it likely to be the model
component that has the largest impact on computational efficiency.

models to study the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on first star
formation. Our models self-consistently combine two competing effects: initial
(isocurvature) perturbations induced by PBHs and BH accretion feedback.
Focusing on PBHs with masses $\sim 30\ \rm M_{\odot}$, we find that the
standard picture of first star formation in molecular-cooling minihaloes is not
changed by PBHs, as the simulated star-forming gas clouds in the central parsec
are very similar to those in the $\rm \Lambda CDM$ case when PBHs make up
$f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-4}-0.1$ of dark matter. With a dynamical friction
timescale of $\sim 2-10\ \rm Myr$ when the central gas density reaches $10^{5}\
\rm cm^{-3}$, it is also unlikely that PBHs can sink into star-forming discs
and affect the evolution of protostars, although they may interact with the
stars during the main-sequence stage. At larger scales, PBHs tend to shift star
formation to more massive haloes, and accelerate structure formation. The
latter effect is stronger in regions with higher initial overdensities. For
$f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-4}-0.01$ (allowed by observational constraints), the
collapsed mass fraction of haloes hosting Population III stars is similar
(within a factor of $\sim2$ at $z\lesssim 30$) to that in $\rm \Lambda CDM$,
implying that the impact of stellar-mass PBHs on the cosmic star formation
history at $z\gtrsim 10$ is small. We also find that the Lyman-Werner photons
from PBH accretion in atomic-cooling haloes may facilitate the formation of
direct-collapse BHs.

be described by an effective axion action with a quantized axion field. Once
both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken, for example, in
antiferromagnetic topological insulators, the axion field becomes dynamical
along with magnetic fluctuations. The dynamical axion field, when coupled to
electromagnetic fields, can lead to rich physical phenomena. Here, based on the
modified Maxwell's equations, we reveal the existence of an exotic type of
polariton excitation, termed a surface axion polariton, which propagates in the
interface between a dynamical axion insulator and a dielectric. When doping the
dynamical axion insulator to be metallic, the coexistence of axion-photon
coupling and plasmon-photon coupling will further generate a mixed surface
axion plasmon polariton. We also propose a Kretschmann-Raether configuration to
experimentally detect the surface axion polariton. Our result provides an
alternative way to study the axion electrodynamics in condensed matter physics.

for the reliable and fail-safe operation of electricity grids. The reasons for

low-voltage grid is largely unmonitored and local power failures are sometimes
hard to detect. To overcome this, power line communication (PLC) has emerged as
a potential solution for reliable monitoring of the low-voltage grid. In
addition to establishing a communication infrastructure, PLC also offers the
possibility of evaluating the cables themselves, as well as the connection
quality between individual cable distributors based on their Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR). The roll-out of a large-scale PLC infrastructure therefore not
only ensures communication, but also introduces a tool for monitoring the

modems in three different areas of a German city with a population of about
150,000 as part of the F\""uhler-im-Netz project. Over a period of 22 months, an
SNR spectrum of each connection between adjacent PLC modems was generated every

a detailed analysis of the data generation and describes how the data was
collected during normal operation of the electricity grid. In addition, we
present common anomalies, effects, and trends that could be observed in the PLC

determined the distribution of the hydrogen column density (N(H2)) and dust

photometric data to identify and classify the YSOs. We also constructed a
colour-magnitude diagram and K luminosity functions (KLFs) to compare the

that N(H2) varies from about 3.0 to 5.5x10^(23)cm^(-2) within the G45.07 and
G45.12 regions, respectively. The maximum Td value is 35K in G45.12 and 42K in

UCHII regions are connected through a cold (Td=19K) bridge. The density
distribution of 518 YSOs exhibits dense clusters around both IRAS sources. The
parameters of YSOs in the IRAS clusters (124 objects) and 394 non-cluster
objects surrounding them show some differences. About 75% of the YSOs belonging
to the IRAS clusters have an evolutionary age greater than 10^6 years. Their
slope alpha of the KLF agrees well with a Salpeter-type Initial Mass Function
(IMF) (gamma=1.35) for a high mass range (O-F stars, beta=2) at 1Myr. The
non-cluster objects are uniformly distributed in the molecular cloud, 80% of
which are located to the right of the 0.1Myr isochrone. Based on the small age
spread of the stellar objects, we suggest that the clusters originate from a

increasingly important that they are not only able to perform well on their
training distribution, but also yield accurate predictions when confronted with
distribution shift. The Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework
proposes to address this issue by training models to minimize their expected
risk under a collection of distributions, to imitate test-time shifts. This is
most commonly achieved by instance-level re-weighting of the training objective
to emulate the likelihood ratio with possible test distributions, which allows
for estimating their empirical risk via importance sampling (assuming that they
are subpopulations of the training distribution). However, re-weighting schemes
in the literature are usually limited due to the difficulty of keeping the
optimization problem tractable and the complexity of enforcing normalization
constraints. In this paper, we show that three simple ideas -- mini-batch level
normalization, a KL penalty and simultaneous gradient updates -- allow us to
train models with DRO using a broader class of parametric likelihood ratios. In
a series of experiments on both image and text classification benchmarks, we
find that models trained with the resulting parametric adversaries are
consistently more robust to subpopulation shifts when compared to other DRO
approaches, and that the method performs reliably well with little
hyper-parameter tuning. Code to reproduce our experiments can be found at

another highly challenging set of 20 polyurethane foams differing in material

together with the effects of: (1) type of classifier (k-NN, SVM, LSTM)

configuration and speed of squeezing), (3) contribution of sensory modalities.
Classification results are complemented by visualization of the data using PCA.
We found: (i) all the grippers but the qb SoftHand could reliably distinguish
the ordinary objects set; (ii) Barrett Hand reached around 95% accuracy on the
foams; OnRobot RG6 around 75% and Robotiq 2F-85 around 70%; (iii) across all

faster compression speeds degrade classification performance; (v) transfer
learning between compression speeds worked well for the Barrett Hand only;
transfer between grasping configurations is limited; (vi) ablation experiments
provided intriguing insights -- sometimes a single sensory channel suffices for
discrimination. Overall, the Barrett Hand as a complex and expensive device
with rich sensory feedback provided best results, but uncalibrated parallel jaw
grippers without tactile sensors can have sufficient performance for
single-grasp object discrimination based on position and effort data only.

(e.g., researchers co-authoring a paper and ingredients used together in a
recipe), each of which corresponds to a hyperedge (i.e., a subset of nodes).
Predicting future or missing hyperedges bears significant implications for many
applications (e.g., collaboration and recipe recommendation). What makes
hyperedge prediction particularly challenging is the vast number of
non-hyperedge subsets, which grows exponentially with the number of nodes.
Since it is prohibitive to use all of them as negative examples for model
training, it is inevitable to sample a very small portion of them, and to this
end, heuristic sampling schemes have been employed. However, trained models
suffer from poor generalization capability for examples of different natures.
In this paper, we propose AHP, an adversarial training-based
hyperedge-prediction method. It learns to sample negative examples without
relying on any heuristic schemes. Using six real hypergraphs, we show that AHP
generalizes better to negative examples of various natures. It yields up to
28.2% higher AUROC than the best existing methods and often even outperforms
its variants with sampling schemes tailored to test sets.

paradigmatic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, in the thermodynamic limit. Exact
expressions for the Nielsen complexity (NC) and the Fubini-Study complexity
(FSC) are derived, that helps us to establish several distinguishing features
compared to complexity in other known spin models. In a time-independent LMG
model, close to phase transition, the NC diverges logarithmically, much like
the entanglement entropy. Remarkably however, in a time dependent scenario,
this divergence is replaced by a finite discontinuity, as we show by using the
Lewis-Riesenfeld theory of time-dependent invariant operators. The FSC of a
variant of the LMG model shows novel behaviour compared to quasi free spin
models. Namely, it diverges logarithmically when the target (or reference)
state is near the separatrix. Numerical analysis indicates that this is due to
the fact that geodesics starting with arbitrary boundary conditions are
""attracted"" towards the separatrix and that near this line, a finite change in
the affine parameter of the geodesic produces an infinitesimal change of the
geodesic length. The same divergence is shared by the NC of this model as well.

in deep learning has led to significant practical successes in a range of
tasks, including in particular in computer vision. Building on these advances,
reinforcement learning has also seen a leap forward with the emergence of
agents capable of making decisions directly from visual observations. Despite
these successes, the over-parametrization of neural architectures leads to
memorization of the data used during training and thus to a lack of
generalization. Reinforcement learning agents based on visual inputs also
suffer from this phenomenon by erroneously correlating rewards with unrelated
visual features such as background elements. To alleviate this problem, we
introduce a new regularization technique consisting of channel-consistent local
permutations (CLOP) of the feature maps. The proposed permutations induce
robustness to spatial correlations and help prevent overfitting behaviors in
RL. We demonstrate, on the OpenAI Procgen Benchmark, that RL agents trained
with the CLOP method exhibit robustness to visual changes and better
generalization properties than agents trained using other state-of-the-art
regularization techniques. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of CLOP as a
general regularization technique in supervised learning.

state $\eta_{t+1}(n)$ at each vertex $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ is obtained by
$\eta_{t+1}(n)= \text{NAND}\big(\text{BSC}_\delta(\eta_t(n-1)),

exists $\delta_0>0$ such that for all $0<\delta<\delta_0$ the distribution of

condition $\eta_0$.

noisy binary-symmetric channels $\text{BSC}_\delta$, where each node may apply
an arbitrary processing function to its input bits. We prove that there exists
$\delta_0'>0$ such that for all noise levels $0<\delta<\delta_0'$ it is

that LyMAS2, applied to the Horizon-noAGN dark matter fields, significantly
improves the predictions of the Ly-{\alpha} 3d clustering statistics,
especially when the DM overdensity is associated with the velocity dispersion

  Waters, and Large Water Regions, Sep 2021, Online, Spain",,"10.1117/12.2598032",,"cs.CV cs.NE eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ocean surface monitoring, especially oil slick detection, has become
mandatory due to its importance for oil exploration and risk prevention on
ecosystems. For years, the detection task has been performed manually by
photo-interpreters using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with the help of
contextual data such as wind. This tedious manual work cannot handle the
increasing amount of data collected by the available sensors and thus requires
automation. Literature reports conventional and semi-automated detection
methods that generally focus either on oil slicks originating from
anthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) sources on limited data collections.
As an extension, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slicks on
an extensive database with both kinds of slicks. It builds upon the slick
annotations of specialized photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data for 4
years over 3 exploration and monitoring areas worldwide. All the considered SAR
images and related annotation relate to real oil slick monitoring scenarios.
Further, wind estimation is systematically computed to enrich the data
collection. Paper contributions are the following : (i) a performance
comparison of two deep learning approaches: semantic segmentation using
FC-DenseNet and instance segmentation using Mask-RCNN. (ii) the introduction of
meteorological information (wind speed) is deemed valuable for oil slick
detection in the performance evaluation. The main results of this study show
the effectiveness of slick detection by deep learning approaches, in particular
FC-DenseNet, which captures more than 92% of oil instances in our test set.
Furthermore, a strong correlation between model performances and contextual
information such as slick size and wind speed is demonstrated in the
performance evaluation. This work opens perspectives to design models that can
fuse SAR and wind information to reduce the false alarm rate.

of new, large electric loads such as electric vehicles and heat pumps challenge
the correct and reliable operation of low voltage distribution systems. To
tackle potential problems, active management solutions are proposed in the
literature, which require distribution system models that include the phase
connectivity of all the consumers in the network. However, information on the
phase connectivity is in practice often unavailable. In this work, several
voltage and power measurement-based phase identification methods from the
literature are implemented. A consistent comparison of the methods is made
across different smart meter accuracy classes and smart meter penetration
levels using publicly available data. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed
that makes use of ensemble learning and that can combine data from different
measurement campaigns. The results indicate that generally better results are
obtained with voltage data compared to power data from smart meters of the same
accuracy class. If power data is available too, the novel ensemble method can
improve the accuracy of the phase identification obtained from voltage data
alone.

Universe has become a major challenge since the discovery of luminous quasars
only 700 million years after the Big Bang. Simulations indicate an evolutionary
sequence of dust-reddened quasars emerging from heavily dust-obscured
starbursts that then transition to unobscured luminous quasars by expelling gas
and dust. Although the last phase has been identified out to a redshift of 7.6,
a transitioning quasar has not been found at similar redshifts owing to their
faintness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Here we report observations
of an ultraviolet compact object, GNz7q, associated with a dust-enshrouded
starburst at a redshift of z=7.1899+/-0.0005. The host galaxy is more luminous
in dust emission than any other known object at this epoch, forming 1,600 solar
masses of stars per year within a central radius of 480 parsec. A red point
source in the far-ultraviolet is identified in deep, high-resolution imaging
and slitless spectroscopy. GNz7q is extremely faint in X-rays, which indicates
the emergence of a uniquely ultraviolet compact star-forming region or a
Compton-thick super-Eddington black-hole accretion disk at the dusty starburst
core. In the latter case, the observed properties are consistent with
predictions from cosmological simulations and suggest that GNz7q is an
antecedent to unobscured luminous quasars at later epochs.

anyway within its search trajectory. As suggested in Jankovic et al. (EvoAPPs

feature extraction by computing landscape features from points that a solver
sampled and evaluated during the optimization process. Features computed in
this manner are used to train algorithm performance regression models, upon

  In this work, we apply the trajectory-based approach onto a portfolio of five

the possibility of switching between the solvers once, which requires them to

Perovskites with thicker phases $n \geq 2$, has been identified as the source

(SET). The goal of SET is to detect an arbitrary number of high-priority event
classes while allowing misdetections of low-priority event classes where the
priority is given for each event class. In conventional methods of SED for
targeting a specific sound event class, it is only possible to give priority to
a single event class. Moreover, the level of priority is not adjustable, i.e,
the conventional methods can use only types of target event class such as
one-hot vector, as inputs. To flexibly control much information on the target
event, the proposed SET exploits not only types of target sound but also the
extent to which each target sound is detected with priority. To implement the
detection of events with priority, we propose class-weighted training, in which
loss functions and the network are stochastically weighted by the priority
parameter of each class. As this is the first paper on SET, we particularly
introduce an implementation of single target SET, which is a subtask of SET.
Results of the experiments using the URBAN-SED dataset show that the proposed
method of single target SET outperforms the conventional SED method by 8.70,
6.66, and 6.09 percentage points for ``air_conditioner,'' ``car_horn,'' and
``street_music,'' respectively, in terms of the intersection-based F-score. For
the average score of classes, the proposed methods increase the
intersection-based F-score by up to 3.37 percentage points compared with the
conventional SED and other target-class-conditioned models.

scaling parameters, based on which we design a novel regularisation term that
suppresses only neurons with low importance. Under our method, the weights of

identified several time intervals with a duration of half a year or longer

variations does not change. We found that the NS precession period varies
within one per cent in different intervals. Such variations in the free
precession period on a year time scale can be explained by <1% changes in the

discover such a secluded form of matter at high energy colliders. We explore
the full parameter space relevant to multi-lepton (2- and 3-lepton) signatures
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from representative minimal consistent
models with scalar and fermion DM. In our analysis, we suggest a new
parametrisation of the model parameter spaces in terms of the DM mass and mass
differences between DM and its multiplet partners. This parametrisation allows
us to explore properties of DM models in their whole parameter space. This
approach is generic and quite model-independent since the mass differences are
related to the couplings of the DM to the Standard Model (SM) sector. We
establish the most up-to-date LHC limits on the inert 2-Higgs Doublet Model
(i2HDM) and Minimal Fermion DM (MFDM) model parameter spaces, by using the
complementary information stemming from 2- and 3-lepton signatures. We provide
a map of LHC efficiencies and cross-section limits for such 2- and 3-lepton
signatures allowing one to easily make model-independent reinterpretations of
LHC results for analogous classes of models. We also present combined
constraints from the LHC, DM relic density and direct search experiments
indicating the current status of the i2HDM and MFDM model.

Laser driving is used to couple the internal levels and to induce an effective

interacting regime, where in the absence of flux the system behaves as a Mott
insulator with suppressed motional dynamics. At integer and fractional ratios
of the laser Rabi frequency to the onsite interactions, the system exhibits
resonant features in the dynamics. These resonances occur when interactions
help overcome kinetic constraints upon the tunneling of atoms, thus enabling
motion. Different resonances allow for the development of complex chiral
current patterns. The resonances resemble the ones appearing in the
longitudinal Hall resistance when the magnetic field is varied. We characterize
the dynamics by studying the system's long-time relaxation behavior as a
function of flux, number of internal levels $n$, and interaction strength. We
observe a series of non-trivial pre-thermal plateaus caused by the emergence of
resonant processes at successive orders in perturbation theory. We discuss

also a good thermal bath, in the sense that it allows a system coupled to it to
thermalize. We address this question by considering the dynamics of a system of
$N$ random non-interacting Majorana fermions coupled to an SYK$_{4}$ bath with
$M$ Majorana fermions that we solve with Keldysh techniques in the limit of
$M\gg N\gg 1$. We compare this nonequilibrium setting with a conventional bath
made of free non-interacting degrees of freedom with a continous spectrum. We
show that the SYK$_{4}$ bath is more efficient in thermalising the system at
weak coupling, due to its enhanced density of states at low frequency, while at
strong system-bath couplings both type of environments give rise to a similar
time scale for thermalisation.

learning to address the need for ground truth. Data programming is a practical
WS approach that allows programmatic labeling data samples using labeling
functions (LFs) instead of hand-labeling each data point. However, the existing
approach fails to fully exploit the domain knowledge encoded into LFs,
especially when the LFs' coverage is low. This is due to the common data
programming pipeline that neglects to utilize data features during the
generative process. This paper proposes a new approach called reinforced
labeling (RL). Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of LFs, RL augments the
LFs' outputs to cases not covered by LFs based on similarities among samples.
Thus, RL can lead to higher labeling coverage for training an end classifier.
The experiments on several domains (classification of YouTube comments, wine

produces significant performance improvement, leading up to +21 points in

previously been done in various modified gravity and quantum gravitationally
inspired cosmologies (besides standard general relativistic cosmology), no such
an endeavour has been taken up till now in the realms of renormalization group
approaches to cosmology and we have hence took up on this journey. In this
work, we consider the formation of cosmological singularities in an
asymptotically safe cosmology where the cut off scale is proportional to the
Hubble parameter. We consider a well motivated inhomogeneous form of the
equation of state(EOS) as well. We firstly delve into some basics of this
cosmology and show that such a scenario permits a transition between phantom
and quintessence forms of universal evolution. We then show that one can have
Type I - Type IV singularities in such a cosmology for various version of the
EOS and that the singularities can occur both in finite and infinite time. The
conditions in which these singularities occur is significantly different than
how they occur in the standard cosmology, with the formulations being even more
involved. Interestingly this difference comes about without the need of any
free parameters in the cosmological models, which is usually what one observes
when one goes for the same pursuit via various modified gravity/ QG inspired
cosmological approaches. Furthermore, we showed that usual singularity removal
methods like conformal anomaly effects and f(R) gravity effects do not offer
much hope for singularity removal in this cosmology.

automated-decision making algorithms, there has been strong recent interest in
the design of fair algorithms. However, there is often a dichotomy between
fairness and efficacy: fair algorithms may proffer low social welfare solutions
whereas welfare optimizing algorithms may be very unfair. This issue is
exemplified in the machine scheduling problem where, for $n$ jobs, the social
welfare of any fair solution may be a factor $\Omega(n)$ worse than the optimal
welfare. In this paper, we prove that this dichotomy between fairness and
efficacy can be overcome if we allow for a negligible amount of bias: there
exist algorithms that are both ""almost perfectly fair"" and have a constant
factor efficacy ratio, that is, are guaranteed to output solutions that have
social welfare within a constant factor of optimal welfare. Specifically, for
any $\epsilon>0$, there exist mechanisms with efficacy ratio
$\Theta(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and where no agent is more than an $\epsilon$
fraction worse off than they are in the fairest possible solution (given by an
algorithm that does not use personal or type data). Moreover, these bicriteria
guarantees are tight and apply to both the single machine case and the multiple
machine case. The key to our results are the use of Pareto scheduling
mechanisms. These mechanisms, by the judicious use of personal or type data,
are able to exploit Pareto improvements that benefit every individual; such
Pareto improvements would typically be forbidden by fair scheduling algorithms
designed to satisfy standard statistical measures of group fairness. We
anticipate this paradigm, the judicious use of personal data by a fair

wider application.

wavefront drifts that degrade the DH contrast during the observing time, thus
limiting the ability to retrieve planetary signals. Lyot-style coronagraphs are
starlight suppression systems that remove the central part of the image for an
unresolved observed star, the point spread function, with an opaque focal plane

the mask rejects part of the starlight through the pinhole which can be used to
retrieve information about low-order aberrations. We propose an active control
scheme using a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) to analyze the light rejected by
the FPM, control low-order aberrations, and stabilize the DH contrast. The
concept formalism is first presented before characterizing the sensor behavior
in simulations and in laboratory. We then perform experimental tests to
validate a wavefront control loop using a ZWFS on the HiCAT testbed. By
controlling the first 11 Zernike modes, we show a decrease in wavefront error
standard deviation by a factor of up to 9 between open- and closed-loop
operations using the ZWFS. In the presence of wavefront perturbations, we show
the ability of this control loop to stabilize a DH contrast around 7x10^-8 with
a standard deviation of 7x10^-9. Active control with a ZWFS proves a promising
solution in Lyot coronagraphs with an FPM-filtered beam to control and
stabilize low-order wavefront aberrations and DH contrast for exoplanet imaging

to build Markovian Generative Architectures (MGA) over PLM backbones for
efficient TOD systems. Experiments on MultiWOZ2.1 show that in the

without performance degradation; in the low-resource setting, the training

(QoLE) and plays a major role in developing intelligent educational interfaces.
The number of people learning through Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and
other online resources has been increasing rapidly because they provide us with
the flexibility to learn from anywhere at any time. This provides a good
learning experience for the students. However, such learning interface requires
the ability to recognize the level of engagement of the students for a holistic
learning experience. This is useful for both students and educators alike.
However, understanding engagement is a challenging task, because of its
subjectivity and ability to collect data. In this paper, we propose a variety
of models that have been trained on an open-source dataset of video
screengrabs. Our non-deep learning models are based on the combination of
popular algorithms such as Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust
Features (SURF). The deep learning methods include Densely Connected
Convolutional Networks (DenseNet-121), Residual Network (ResNet-18) and
MobileNetV1. We show the performance of each models using a variety of metrics
such as the Gini Index, Adjusted F-Measure (AGF), and Area Under receiver
operating characteristic Curve (AUC). We use various dimensionality reduction
techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to understand the distribution of data in
the feature sub-space. Our work will thereby assist the educators and students
in obtaining a fruitful and efficient online learning experience.

  Segmentation for Lung Adenocarcinoma",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype. Exploiting the potential
value of the histopathology images can promote precision medicine in oncology.
Tissue segmentation is the basic upstream task of histopathology image
analysis. Existing deep learning models have achieved superior segmentation
performance but require sufficient pixel-level annotations, which is
time-consuming and expensive. To enrich the label resources of LUAD and to
alleviate the annotation efforts, we organize this challenge WSSS4LUAD to call
for the outstanding weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) techniques
for histopathology images of LUAD. Participants have to design the algorithm to
segment tumor epithelial, tumor-associated stroma and normal tissue with only
patch-level labels. This challenge includes 10,091 patch-level annotations (the
training set) and over 130 million labeled pixels (the validation and test
sets), from 87 WSIs (67 from GDPH, 20 from TCGA). All the labels were generated
by a pathologist-in-the-loop pipeline with the help of AI models and checked by
the label review board. Among 532 registrations, 28 teams submitted the results
in the test phase with over 1,000 submissions. Finally, the first place team
achieved mIoU of 0.8413 (tumor: 0.8389, stroma: 0.7931, normal: 0.8919).
According to the technical reports of the top-tier teams, CAM is still the most
popular approach in WSSS. Cutmix data augmentation has been widely adopted to
generate more reliable samples. With the success of this challenge, we believe
that WSSS approaches with patch-level annotations can be a complement to the
traditional pixel annotations while reducing the annotation efforts. The entire
dataset has been released to encourage more researches on computational
pathology in LUAD and more novel WSSS techniques.

effective cross-lingual zero-shot transfer in many NLP tasks. A cross-lingual
adjustment of these models using a small parallel corpus can potentially
further improve results. This is a more data efficient method compared to
training a machine-translation system or a multi-lingual model from scratch
using only parallel data. In this study, we experiment with zero-shot transfer
of English models to four typologically different languages (Spanish, Russian,
Vietnamese, and Hindi) and three NLP tasks (QA, NLI, and NER). We carry out a
cross-lingual adjustment of an off-the-shelf mBERT model. We confirm prior
finding that this adjustment makes embeddings of semantically similar words
from different languages closer to each other, while keeping unrelated words
apart. However, from the paired-differences histograms introduced in our work
we can see that the adjustment only modestly affects the relative distances
between related and unrelated words. In contrast, fine-tuning of mBERT on
English data (for a specific task such as NER) draws embeddings of both related
and unrelated words closer to each other. The cross-lingual adjustment of mBERT
improves NLI in four languages and NER in two languages, while QA performance
never improves and sometimes degrades. When we fine-tune a cross-lingual
adjusted mBERT for a specific task (e.g., NLI), the cross-lingual adjustment of
mBERT may still improve the separation between related and related words, but
this works consistently only for the XNLI task. Our study contributes to a
better understanding of cross-lingual transfer capabilities of large
multilingual language models and of effectiveness of their cross-lingual
adjustment in various NLP tasks.

Experimentally, the method is arguably simple and low cost, and it is not

off-resonance frequencies, it allows for determining the imaginary parts of the

metal-insulator transition involves the emergence of a Jahn-Teller (JT)
distortion similar to the case of the related rare-earth vanadates, which also
exhibit a nominal $d^2$ occupation of the transition metal cation. Our
calculations indicate that, for realistic values of the Hubbard $U$ parameter,
the unstrained system exhibts a C-type antiferromagnetically ordered ground
state, that is already rather close to a JT instability. However, the emergence
of the JT distortion is disfavored by the large energetic overlap of the
$d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ band with the lower lying $d_{xy}$ band. Tensile epitaxial
strain lowers the energy of the $d_{xy}$ band relative to $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ and
thus brings the system closer to the nominal filling of
$d_{xy}^1(d_{xz}d_{yz})^1$. The JT distortion then lifts the degeneracy between
the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals and thus allows to open up a gap in the
electronic band structure.

giving rise to a transverse voltage $V_\perp$. Here, relying upon the equation
of vortex motion under competing vortex-vortex and $I_\mathrm{tr}$-vortex

[$\xi$: coherence length, $w$: strip width, $\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$: effective

$V_\perp(I_\mathrm{tr})$ which can be measured with Hall voltage leads placed
on the line $V_1V_2$ at a small distance $l$ apart from the edge defect and
which changes its sign upon $l\rightarrow -l$ reversal. For narrow strips, we
compare the theoretical predictions with experiment, by fitting the
$V_\perp(I_\mathrm{tr},l)$ data for $1\,\mu$m-wide MoSi strips with single edge
defects milled by a focused ion beam at distances $l = 16$-$80$\,nm from the

vortices moving in Pb bridges with a narrowing. Our findings are augmented with
the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations which reproduce the calculated
vortex jet shapes and the $V_\perp(I_\mathrm{tr},l)$ maxima. Furthermore, with

identified a kink in the IFMR for initial masses close to $2\,M_{\odot}$.
Adopting a physically-sound approach in which the efficiency $\lambda$ of the
3DU varies as a function of core and envelope masses, we calibrate $\lambda$ in
solar-metallicity TP-AGB models in order to reproduce the final masses of their
WD progeny, over a the range of initial masses $0.9 \le M_{\rm i}/M_{\odot} \le
6$. In particular, we find that in low-mass stars with $1.4 \le M_{\rm
i}/M_{\odot} \le 2.0$ the efficiency is small, $\lambda \le 0.3$, it steeply
rises to about $\lambda \simeq 0.65$ in intermediate-mass stars with $2.0 \le
M_{\rm i}/M_{\odot} \le 4.0$, and then it drops in massive TP-AGB stars with
$4.0 \le M_{\rm i}/M_{\odot} \le 6.0$. Our study also suggests that a second

stars and those that are dominated by hot-bottom burning.

entanglement', is different from 'target-space entanglement' proposed and
discussed recently by several groups. We consider several classes of quantum
states to which our approach can play important roles. When applied to fuzzy
sphere, matrix entanglement can be used to define the usual spatial
entanglement in two-brane or five-brane world-volume theory nonperturbatively
in a regularized setup. Another application is to a small black hole in AdS5*S5
that can evaporate without being attached to a heat bath, for which our
approach suggests a gauge theory origin of the Page curve. The confined degrees
of freedom in the partially-deconfined states play the important roles.

dependence on the density. We improve upon the existing literature by obtaining
two regularity results. The first is the existence of classical solutions
without the need to assume blow-up of the cost function near small densities.
The second result is the interior smoothness of weak solutions without the need
to assume neither blow-up of the cost function nor that the initial density be
bounded away from zero. We also characterize the long time behavior of the
solutions, proving that they satisfy the turnpike property with an exponential
rate of convergence, and that they converge to the solution of the infinite
horizon system. Our approach relies on the elliptic structure of the system and
displacement convexity estimates. In particular, we apply displacement
convexity methods to obtain both global and local a priori lower bounds on the
density.

contribution from magnetic bubbles from that of the volume-filling magnetic
component expected to be due to the seed field originating in the Early
Universe. We use this separation to extract the redshift dependence of each
component and to compare TNG model predictions with observation measurements of
the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We find that magnetized bubbles provide a
sizeable contribution to the extragalactic RM, with redshift-independent
$\langle |{\rm RM}| \rangle \simeq 13$ rad/m$^2$ for sources at redshifts $z\ge
2$. This is close to the mean residual RM of $16$ rad/m$^2$ found from NVSS
data in this redshift range. Using the IllustrisTNG simulations, we also
evaluate a simple model for the contribution to residual RM from individual
host galaxies and show that this contribution is negligible at high-redshift.
While the contribution from magnetic bubbles in the IllustrisTNG model is
currently compatible with observational measurements of residual RM, the
next-generation RM sky surveys, which will be free from the wrapping
uncertainty, have larger statistics and better sensitivity should be able to
observe predicted flat contribution from magnetic bubbles at large redshifts.
This should allow to experimentally probe magnetic bubbles and check models of
galaxy feedback in cosmological simulations.

($\alpha,\mu$)-entropy for nonunitary physical processes. The bounds depend on
both the Schatten speed and the smallest eigenvalue of the evolved state, and
the two-parametric unified entropy. We specialize these results to quantum
channels and non-Hermitian evolutions. In the first case, the QSL depends on
the Kraus operators related to the quantum channel, while in the second case
the speed limit is recast in terms of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. To
illustrate these findings, we consider a single-qubit state evolving under the
(i) amplitude damping channel, and (ii) the nonunitary dynamics generated by a
parity-time-reversal symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The QSL is nonzero at
earlier times, while it becomes loose as the smallest eigenvalue of the evolved
state approaches zero. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between
unified entropies and speed limits for the reduced dynamics of quantum
many-body systems. The unified entropy is upper bounded by the quantum
fluctuations of the Hamiltonian of the system, while the QSL is nonzero when
entanglement is created by the nonunitary evolution. Finally, we apply these
results to the XXZ model and verify that the QSL asymptotically decreases as
the system size increases. Our results find applications to nonequilibrium

significantly increases the perceptual sound quality in early-20th-century

wearing low-quality masks leads to a near fivefold city-wide increase in the
number of cases even if all staff is vaccinated, (ii) resuming activities with

prevent biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first global, wall-to-wall
canopy height map at 10 m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. No single
data source meets these requirements: dedicated space missions like GEDI
deliver sparse height data, with unprecedented coverage, whereas optical
satellite images like Sentinel-2 offer dense observations globally, but cannot
directly measure vertical structures. By fusing GEDI with Sentinel-2, we have
developed a probabilistic deep learning model to retrieve canopy height from
Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth, and to quantify the uncertainty in these
estimates. The presented approach reduces the saturation effect commonly
encountered when estimating canopy height from satellite images, allowing to
resolve tall canopies with likely high carbon stocks. According to our map,
only 5% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Such data
play an important role for conservation, e.g., we find that only 34% of these
tall canopies are located within protected areas. Our model enables consistent,
uncertainty-informed worldwide mapping and supports an ongoing monitoring to
detect change and inform decision making. The approach can serve ongoing
efforts in forest conservation, and has the potential to foster advances in
climate, carbon, and biodiversity modelling.

capacity to generate visually plausible results, which inhibits its
applications on resource-constraint platforms. In this work, we propose
MobileFSGAN, a novel lightweight GAN for face swap that can run on mobile
devices with much fewer parameters while achieving competitive performance. A
lightweight encoder-decoder structure is designed especially for image
synthesis tasks, which is only 10.2MB and can run on mobile devices at a
real-time speed. To tackle the unstability of training such a small network, we
construct the FSTriplets dataset utilizing facial attribute editing techniques.
FSTriplets provides source-target-result training triplets, yielding
pixel-level labels thus for the first time making the training process
supervised. We also designed multi-scale gradient losses for efficient
back-propagation, resulting in faster and better convergence. Experimental
results show that our model reaches comparable performance towards
state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing the number of network
parameters. Codes and the dataset have been released.

evolution of the textile industry system. As the innovation process changes, so
does the degree of technological diffusion and the state of competitive
equilibrium in the textile industry system, and this leads to fluctuations in
the economic growth of the industry system. The fluctuations resulting from the
role of innovation are complex, irregular and imperfectly cyclical. The study
of the chaos model of the accumulation of innovation in the evolution of the
textile industry can help to provide theoretical guidance for technological
innovation in the textile industry, and can help to provide suggestions for the
interaction between the government and the textile enterprises themselves. It
is found that reasonable government regulation parameters contribute to the
accelerated accumulation of innovation in the textile industry.

the mid-infrared. The measurement principle of the sensor relies on
supercontinuum-based Fourier transform photoacoustic spectroscopy (FT-PAS), in
which a scanning interferometer modulates the intensity of a mid-infrared
supercontinuum light source and a cantilever microphone is employed for
sensitive photoacoustic detection. With a custom-built external Herriott cell,
the supercontinuum beam propagates ten times through a miniature and
acoustically non-resonant gas cell. The performance of the FT-PAS system is
demonstrated by measuring the fundamental C-H stretch bands of various
hydrocarbons. A noise equivalent detection limit of 11 ppb is obtained for
methane (40 s averaging time, 15 $\mu$W/cm$^{-1}$ incident power spectral
density, 4 cm$^{-1}$ resolution), which is an improvement by a factor of 12
compared to the best previous FT-PAS systems. High linearity and good stability
of the sensor provide reliable identification of individual species from a gas
mixture with strong spectral overlap, laying the foundation for sensitive and
selective multi-species detection in small sample volumes.

conductive and radiative heat transfer in a Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
sample. PMMA is a kind of polymer utilized in various sensors and actuator
devices. One-dimensional combined heat transfer is considered in numerical
analysis. Computer implementation was obtained for the numerical solution of
governing equation with the implicit finite difference method in the case of
discretization. Kirchhoff transformation was used to get data from a non-linear
equation of conductive heat transfer by considering monochromatic radiation
intensity and temperature conditions applied to the PMMA sample boundaries. For
Deep Neural Network (DNN) method, the novel Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
method was introduced to find accurate results in the least processing time
than the numerical method. A recent study derived the combined heat transfers
and their temperature profiles for the PMMA sample. Furthermore, the transient
temperature profile is validated by another study. A comparison proves a
perfect agreement. It shows the temperature gradient in the primary positions
that makes a spectral amount of conductive heat transfer from a PMMA sample. It
is more straightforward when they are compared with the novel DNN method.
Results demonstrate that this artificial intelligence method is accurate and
fast in predicting problems. By analyzing the results from the numerical
solution it can be understood that the conductive and radiative heat flux is
similar in the case of gradient behavior, but it is also twice in its amount
approximately. Hence, total heat flux has a constant value in an approximated
steady state condition. In addition to analyzing their composition, ROC curve
and confusion matrix were implemented to evaluate the algorithm performance.

employed for SITS classification tasks with encouraging results. This paper
seeks to survey this method against a plethora of other contemporary methods
for SITS classification to validate the existing findings in recent literature.
Comprehensive experiments are carried out on two benchmark SITS datasets with
the results demonstrating that Temporal CNNs display a superior performance to

achieving the desired performance levels particularly at the cell-edge. In
future network architecture, RAN intelligent controller (RIC) running with

component to enable RRM. In this paper, based on deep reinforcement learning
(RL) xApp, a joint sub-band masking and power management is proposed for smart
interference management. The sub-band resource masking problem is formulated as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that can be solved employing deep RL to
approximate the policy functions as well as to avoid extremely high
computational and storage costs of conventional tabular-based approaches. The
developed xApp is scalable in both storage and computation. Simulation results
demonstrate advantages of the proposed approach over decentralized baselines in

However, existing certifications cannot transfer to SNNs directly because of
the distinct neuron behavior and input formats for SNNs. In this work, we first
design S-IBP and S-CROWN that tackle the non-linear functions in SNNs' neuron
modeling. Then, we formalize the boundaries for both digital and spike inputs.
Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed robust training method
