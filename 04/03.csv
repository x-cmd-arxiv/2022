instructed to execute household tasks. Given an instruction such as ""Rinse off
a mug and place it in the coffee maker,"" the robot is required to locate the
mug, wash it, and put it in the coffee maker. This is challenging because the
robot needs to break down the instruction sentences into subgoals and execute
them in the correct order. On the ALFRED benchmark, the performance of
state-of-the-art methods is still far lower than that of humans. This is
partially because existing methods sometimes fail to infer subgoals that are
not explicitly specified in the instruction sentences. We propose Moment-based
Adversarial Training (MAT), which uses two types of moments for perturbation
updates in adversarial training. We introduce MAT to the embedding spaces of
the instruction, subgoals, and state representations to handle their varieties.
We validated our method on the ALFRED benchmark, and the results demonstrated
that our method outperformed the baseline method for all the metrics on the
benchmark.

  End-to-End Neural Diarization","Accepted at Interspeech 2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  End-to-end neural diarization (EEND) is nowadays one of the most prominent
research topics in speaker diarization. EEND presents an attractive alternative
to standard cascaded diarization systems since a single system is trained at
once to deal with the whole diarization problem. Several EEND variants and
approaches are being proposed, however, all these models require large amounts
of annotated data for training but available annotated data are scarce. Thus,
EEND works have used mostly simulated mixtures for training. However, simulated
mixtures do not resemble real conversations in many aspects. In this work we
present an alternative method for creating synthetic conversations that
resemble real ones by using statistics about distributions of pauses and
overlaps estimated on genuine conversations. Furthermore, we analyze the effect
of the source of the statistics, different augmentations and amounts of data.
We demonstrate that our approach performs substantially better than the
original one, while reducing the dependence on the fine-tuning stage.
Experiments are carried out on 2-speaker telephone conversations of Callhome
and DIHARD 3. Together with this publication, we release our implementations of
EEND and the method for creating simulated conversations.

been proposed to solve the problem of high labor cost required to annotate
re-ID datasets. But their performance is still far lower than the supervised
counterparts. In the mean time, clean datasets without noise are used in these
methods, which is not realistic. In this paper, we propose to tackle this
problem by learning re-ID models from automatically generated person tracklets
by multiple objects tracking (MOT) algorithm. To this end, we design a
tracklet-based multi-level clustering (TMC) framework to effectively learn the
re-ID model from the noisy person tracklets. First, intra-tracklet isolation to
reduce ID switch noise within tracklets; second, alternates between using
inter-tracklet association to eliminate ID fragmentation noise and network
training using the pseudo label. Extensive experiments on MARS with various
manually generated noises show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
Specifically, the proposed framework achieved mAP 53.4% and rank-1 63.7% on the
simulated tracklets with strongest noise, even outperforming the best existing
method on clean tracklets. Based on the results, we believe that building re-ID
models from automatically generated noisy tracklets is a reasonable approach
and will also be an important way to make re-ID models feasible in real-world
applications.

we prove bounds for resolution coresets which improve known bounds in the

Horizon Telescope }(EHT) experiment, a remarkable surge in black hole physics
is to use the black hole shadow's observables to distinguish general relativity
(GR) and modified theories of gravity (MoG), which could also help to disclose
the astrophysical nature of the center black hole in EHT observation. In this
paper, we shall extensively carry out the study of a charged rotating black
hole in conformal gravity, in which the term related with the charge has
different falloffs from the usual Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole. We investigate
the spacetime properties including the horizons, ergospheres and the photon
regions; afterward, we show the boundary of black hole shadow and investigate
its characterized observables. The features closely depend on the spin and
charge parameters, which are compared with those in Kerr and KN black holes.
Then presupposing the M87* a charged rotating black hole in conformal gravity,
we also constrain the black hole parameters via the observation constraints
from EHT experiment. We find that the constraints on the inferred circularity
deviation, $\Delta C \lesssim 0.1$, and on the shadow axial ratio, $1< D_x
\lesssim 4/3$, for the M87* black hole are satisfied for the entire parameter
space of the charged rotating black hole in conformal gravity. However, the
shadow angular diameter $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3 \mu as$ will give upper bound on
the parameter space. Our findings indicate that the current charged rotating
black hole in conformal gravity could be a candidate for astrophysical black
holes. Moreover, the EHT observation on the axial ratio $D_x$ may help us to
distinguish Kerr black hole and the current charged rotating black hole in
conformal gravity in some parameter space.

of operations within these regions to be polynomial in the area of the ridge.

composite joints, assembled by adhesive bonding or fusion bonding, through
electrical resistance changes. This study focuses on investigating
multifunctional films and their suitability for ultrasonic welding (USW) of
TPCs, using two approaches: 1) MWCNT/filled polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites
prepared via solvent dispersion, and 2) high conductivity MWCNT buckypaper
embedded between PP films by hot pressing. Nanocomposite formulations
containing 5 wt and 10 wt MWCNTs were synthesized using solvent dispersion
method, followed by compression molding to manufacture films. The effect of
MWCNT concentration on electrical and dynamic mechanical behavior of
multifunctional films was examined with a Sourcemeter and Dynamic Mechanical
Analyzer, and a comparison was made between 5 to 20 wt MWCNT-PP films based on
previous research. Glass fiber/polypropylene (GF/PP) composite joints were
ultrasonically welded in a single lap shear configuration using buckypaper and
MWCNT/PP films. Furthermore, electrical resistance measurements were carried
out for joints under bending loads. It was observed that 15 wt and 20 wt
MWCNT/PP films had higher stability and sensitivity for resistance response
than embedded buckypaper and films with low MWCNT contents, demonstrating their
suitability for USW and potential for SHM.

engineering objects. Thus, extraction of circles from scanned point clouds is a
quite important task in 3D geometry data processing. However, existing circle
extraction methods either are sensitive to the quality of raw point clouds when
classifying circle-boundary points, or require well-designed fitting functions
when regressing circle parameters. To relieve the challenges, we propose an
end-to-end Point Cloud Circle Algebraic Fitting Network (Circle-Net) based on a
synergy of deep circle-boundary point feature learning and weighted algebraic
fitting. First, we design a circle-boundary learning module, which considers
local and global neighboring contexts of each point, to detect all potential
circle-boundary points. Second, we develop a deep feature based circle
parameter learning module for weighted algebraic fitting, without designing any
weight metric, to avoid the influence of outliers during fitting. Unlike most
of the cutting-edge circle extraction wisdoms, the proposed
classification-and-fitting modules are originally co-trained with a
comprehensive loss to enhance the quality of extracted circles.Comparisons on
the established dataset and real-scanned point clouds exhibit clear
improvements of Circle-Net over SOTAs in terms of both noise-robustness and
extraction accuracy. We will release our code, model, and data for both

strength of the self-avoiding interaction plays a significant role in the
preferred packing orientation, leading to a first-order transition for oblate

prolate spheroids the ground state is always a polar like order, strong self
avoidance result with a deep meta-stable state along the equator. We compute
the critical surface describing the transition between azimuthal and polar

container shape, and self avoidance) and show that the critical behavior of

smoothness. In this paper we investigate the theoretical implications of
incorporating a multi-view latent variable model, a type of low-rank model,
into nonparametric density estimation. To do this we perform extensive analysis
on histogram-style estimators that integrate a multi-view model. Our analysis
culminates in showing that there exists a universally consistent
histogram-style estimator that converges to any multi-view model with a finite
number of Lipschitz continuous components at a rate of
$\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{n})$ in $L^1$ error. In contrast, the standard
histogram estimator can converge at a rate slower than $1/\sqrt[d]{n}$ on the
same class of densities. We also introduce a new nonparametric latent variable
model based on the Tucker decomposition. A rudimentary implementation of our
estimators experimentally demonstrates a considerable performance improvement
over the standard histogram estimator. We also provide a thorough analysis of
the sample complexity of our Tucker decomposition-based model and a variety of
other results. Thus, our paper provides solid theoretical foundations for
extending low-rank techniques to the nonparametric setting

balance leads to the competition of many metastable configurations. Here we
present an experimental and theoretical framework for ""active foam"" where an
individual voxel inflates and deflates periodically. We explore structural
adaptations of this disordered material with respect to added activity.
Periodic injection of local activity leads to a small number of irreversible
and reversible T1 transitions throughout the foam. Regardless of the presence
of T1 transitions, individual vertices will displace outwards and subsequently
return back to their approximate original radial position; this radial
displacement follows an inverse law. Surprisingly, each return trajectory does
not retrace its outbound path but rather encloses a finite area, with either a
CW or CCW direction - which we define as a local swirl. These swirls form
coherent patterns spanning the entire scale of the material. Using a reduced
order dynamical model, we demonstrate that swirl arises as a direct consequence
of spatial disorder in the local micro-structure. Building a first principles
model, we demonstrate that disorder and strain rate control a crossover between
cooperation and competition between swirls in adjacent vertices. Over longer
timescales, the region around the active voxel structurally adapts from a
higher-energy metastable state to a lower energy state, indicative of a
localized annealing process. Finally, we develop a statistical toy-model that
evolves edge lengths based on a set of simple rules to explore how this class
of materials adapts over time as a function of initial structure. Adding
activity to foam couples structural disorder and adaptive dynamics to encourage
the development of a new class of abiotic, cellularized active matter.

multiple seismic surveys in the exact location, we can identify the reservoir
changes by analyzing the difference in the data. However, such analysis can be
skewed by the near-surface seasonal velocity variations, inaccuracy in the
acquisition parameters, and other inevitable noise. The common practice
(cross-equalization) to address this problem uses the part of the data where
changes are not expected to design a matching filter and then apply it to the
whole data, including the reservoir area. Like cross-equalization, we train a
recurrent neural network on parts of the data excluding the reservoir area and
then infer the reservoir-related data. The recurrent neural network can learn
the time dependency of the data, unlike the matching filter that processes the

demonstrate the method of matching the data in various examples and compare it

pondering upon is how exactly do we anticipate? Is it by anticipating future

anticipating an occurrence, the human brain counts on both systems. In this

instance, there are toposes in which the axiom of choice and the intermediate
value theorem from undergraduate calculus fail. The purpose of this
contribution is to give a glimpse of the toposophic landscape, presenting
several specific toposes and exploring their peculiar properties, and to
explicate how toposes provide distinct lenses through which the usual
mathematical objects of the standard topos can be viewed.

extract a single feature vector per input image. Few-shot classification
methods also mostly follow this trend. In this work, we depart from this
established direction and instead propose to extract sets of feature vectors
for each image. We argue that a set-based representation intrinsically builds a
richer representation of images from the base classes, which can subsequently
better transfer to the few-shot classes. To do so, we propose to adapt existing
feature extractors to instead produce sets of feature vectors from images. Our
approach, dubbed SetFeat, embeds shallow self-attention mechanisms inside
existing encoder architectures. The attention modules are lightweight, and as
such our method results in encoders that have approximately the same number of
parameters as their original versions. During training and inference, a
set-to-set matching metric is used to perform image classification. The
effectiveness of our proposed architecture and metrics is demonstrated via
thorough experiments on standard few-shot datasets -- namely miniImageNet,
tieredImageNet, and CUB -- in both the 1- and 5-shot scenarios. In all cases
but one, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

develop a methodology to find the nearest NI system to a non NI system. This
later problem stated as follows: for any linear time invariant (LTI) system

with the state space matrices $(A+\Delta_A,B+\Delta_B,C+\Delta_C,D+\Delta_D)$,
such that the norm of $(\Delta_A,\Delta_B,\Delta_C,\Delta_D)$ is minimized.
Then, this methodology will be used to find the nearest optimal controller for

methodology, such as LQG, is used to design an optimal controller that satisfy
a particular performance measure. Then, the developed methodology of finding
the nearest NI system is used, as a near-optimal control synthesis methodology,
to find the nearest NI system to the designed optimal controller. Hence, the
synthesized controller satisfy the NI property and therefore guarantee a robust

  Energy Harvester Non-Linearities","13 pages, 11 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Waveform optimization has shown its great potential to boost the performance
of far-field wireless power transfer (WPT). Current research has optimized
transmit waveform, adaptive to channel state information (CSI), to maximize the
harvested power in WPT while accounting for energy harvester (EH)'s
non-linearity. However, the existing transmit waveform design disregards the
non-linear high power amplifiers (HPA) at the transmitter. Driven by this, this
paper optimizes the multi-carrier waveform at the input of HPA to maximize the
harvested DC power considering both HPA's and EH's non-linearities. Two
optimization models are formulated based on whether the frequencies of the
multi-carrier waveform are concentrated within the transmit pass band or not.
Analysis and simulations show that, while EH's non-linearity boosts the power
harvesting performance, HPA's non-linearity degrades the harvested power.
Hence, the optimal waveform shifts from multi-carrier that exploits EH's
non-linearity to single-carrier that reduces HPA's detrimental non-linear
distortion as the operational regime of WPT becomes more sensitive to HPA's
non-linearity and less sensitive to EH's non-linearity (and inversely).
Simultaneously, operating towards HPA's non-linear regime by increasing the
input signal power benefits the harvested power since HPA's DC power supply is
better exploited, whereas the end-to-end power transfer efficiency (PTE) might
decrease because of the increasing non-linear degradation. Throughout the
simulations, the proposed waveforms show significant gain over those not
accounting for HPA's non-linearity, especially in frequency-flat channels. We
also compare the two proposed waveforms and show that the severity of HPA's
non-linearity dictates which of the two proposed waveforms is more beneficial.

uncertainty about future fitness outcomes, which may all lead to a decline in

researches have been conducted on correcting RS distortions. However, most of
the existing work relies heavily on the prior assumptions of scenes or motions.
Besides, the motion estimation steps are either oversimplified or
computationally inefficient due to the heavy flow warping, limiting their
applicability. In this paper, we investigate using rolling shutter with a
global reset feature (RSGR) to restore clean global shutter (GS) videos. This
feature enables us to turn the rectification problem into a deblur-like one,
getting rid of inaccurate and costly explicit motion estimation. First, we
build an optic system that captures paired RSGR/GS videos. Second, we develop a

beneficial to downstream tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art RS solution,
our RSGR solution is superior in both effectiveness and efficiency. Considering

We have proved the following results in both cases. First, when the $H^k$ norm
of the initial perturbation around a constant state is sufficiently small and
the integer $k\geq2$, a unique classical solution to such Cauchy problem is
shown to exist. Second, if we further assume that the $L^1$ norm of the initial

such ML-based solutions are laid bare. We first explore how phishing sites
bypass ML-based detection with a deep dive into 13K phishing pages targeting
major brands such as Facebook. Results show successful evasion is caused by:
(1) use of benign services to obscure phishing URLs; (2) high similarity
between the HTML structures of phishing and benign pages; (3) hiding the
ultimate phishing content within Javascript and running such scripts only on
the client; (4) looking beyond typical credentials and credit cards for new
content such as IDs and documents; (5) hiding phishing content until after
human interaction. We attribute the root cause to the dependency of ML-based
models on the vertical feature space (webpage content). These solutions rely
only on what phishers present within the page itself. Thus, we propose
Anti-SubtlePhish, a more resilient model based on logistic regression. The key
augmentation is the inclusion of a horizontal feature space, which examines
correlation variables between the final render of suspicious pages against what
trusted services have recorded (e.g., PageRank). To defeat (1) and (2), we
correlate information between WHOIS, PageRank, and page analytics. To combat

modeling has achieved tremendous success in NLP, images, and point clouds, such
as BERT. However, directly extending BERT from NLP to point clouds requires
training a fixed discrete Variational AutoEncoder (dVAE) before pre-training,
which results in a complex two-stage method called Point-BERT. Inspired by BERT
and MoCo, we propose POS-BERT, a one-stage BERT pre-training method for point
clouds. Specifically, we use the mask patch modeling (MPM) task to perform
point cloud pre-training, which aims to recover masked patches information
under the supervision of the corresponding tokenizer output. Unlike Point-BERT,
its tokenizer is extra-trained and frozen. We propose to use the dynamically
updated momentum encoder as the tokenizer, which is updated and outputs the
dynamic supervision signal along with the training process. Further, in order
to learn high-level semantic representation, we combine contrastive learning to
maximize the class token consistency between different transformation point
clouds. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that POS-BERT can extract
high-quality pre-training features and promote downstream tasks to improve
performance. Using the pre-training model without any fine-tuning to extract
features and train linear SVM on ModelNet40, POS-BERT achieves the
state-of-the-art classification accuracy, which exceeds Point-BERT by 3.5\%. In
addition, our approach has significantly improved many downstream tasks, such
as fine-tuned classification, few-shot classification, part segmentation. The

several attempts have tried variable-length speaker embedding. However, they
neglect to transfer the personal pronunciation characteristics related to
phoneme content, leading to poor speaker similarity in terms of detailed
speaking styles and pronunciation habits. To improve the ability of the speaker
encoder to model personal pronunciation characteristics, we propose
content-dependent fine-grained speaker embedding for zero-shot speaker
adaptation. The corresponding local content embeddings and speaker embeddings
are extracted from a reference speech, respectively. Instead of modeling the
temporal relations, a reference attention module is introduced to model the
content relevance between the reference speech and the input text, and to
generate the fine-grained speaker embedding for each phoneme encoder output.
The experimental results show that our proposed method can improve speaker
similarity of synthesized speeches, especially for unseen speakers.

During the past decades, the three- and four-wave mixing ($\chi^{(2)}$ and
$\chi^{(3)}$) effects have been extensively studied, especially in the
micro-/nano-structures by which the photon-photon interaction strength is
greatly enhanced. So far, the high-order nonlinearity beyond the $\chi^{(3)}$
has rarely been studied in dielectric materials due to their weak intrinsic
nonlinear susceptibility, even in high-quality microcavities. Here, an
effective five-wave mixing process ($\chi^{(4)}$) is synthesized for the first
time, by incorporating $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ processes in a single
microcavity. The coherence of the synthetic $\chi^{(4)}$ is verified by
generating time-energy entangled visible-telecom photon-pairs, which requires
only one drive laser at the telecom waveband. The photon pair generation rate
from the synthetic process shows an enhancement factor over $500$ times upon
intrinsic five-wave mixing. Our work demonstrates a universal approach of
nonlinear synthesis via photonic structure engineering at the mesoscopic scale

it by a frequency analysis. Inspired by this finding, we first investigate the

can be attributed to the better usage of the high-frequency components. Then,
to compensate for this insufficient ability of ViT models, we propose HAT,

The automated design of metaheuristic algorithms provides an attractive path to

representation in the current automated design pipeline restrict the design
within a fixed algorithm structure, which hinders discovering novelties and
diversity across the metaheuristic family. To address this challenge, this
paper proposes a general framework, AutoOpt, for automatically designing

innovations: (i) A general algorithm prototype dedicated to covering the
metaheuristic family as widely as possible. It promotes high-quality automated
design on different problems by fully discovering potentials and novelties
across the family. (ii) A directed acyclic graph algorithm representation to
fit the proposed prototype. Its flexibility and evolvability enable discovering
various algorithm structures in a single run of design, thus boosting the
possibility of finding high-performance algorithms. (iii) A graph
representation embedding method offering an alternative compact form of the
graph to be manipulated, which ensures AutoOpt's generality. Experiments on
numeral functions and real applications validate AutoOpt's efficiency and
practicability.

counterpart. It works on the principle of superposition. But due to the
decoherence effect, the superposition of a quantum state gets destroyed by the
interaction with the environment. It is a real challenge to completely isolate
a quantum system to make it free of decoherence. This problem can be
circumvented by the use of topological quantum phases of matter. These phases
have quasiparticles excitations called anyons. The anyons are charge-flux
composites and show exotic fractional statistics. When the order of exchange
matters, then the anyons are called non-Abelian anyons. Majorana fermions in
topological superconductors and quasiparticles in some quantum Hall states are
non-Abelian anyons. Such topological phases of matter have a ground state
degeneracy. The fusion of two or more non-Abelian anyons can result in a
superposition of several anyons. The topological quantum gates are implemented
by braiding and fusion of the non-Abelian anyons. The fault-tolerance is
achieved through the topological degrees of freedom of anyons. Such degrees of
freedom are non-local, hence inaccessible to the local perturbations. In this
paper, the Hilbert space for a topological qubit is discussed. The Ising and
Fibonacci anyonic models for binary gates are briefly given. Ternary logic
gates are more compact than their binary counterparts and naturally arise in a
type of anyonic model called the metaplectic anyons. The mathematical model,
for the fusion and braiding matrices of metaplectic anyons, is the quantum
deformation of the recoupling theory. We proposed that the existing quantum
ternary arithmetic gates can be realized by braiding and topological charge
measurement of the metaplectic anyons.

the non-linear YM charge parameter, temperature, and pressure. And both the
changes of photon sphere radius and impact parameter before and after phase
transition can be regarded as the order parameter, their critical exponents

ordinary thermal systems. These indicate that there maybe exists a universal
relationship of gravity nearby the critical point for a black hole

more realistic situations where action interruption or action inconsistencies
occur in the video. Besides, we also provide a fine-grained annotation of the

Such a dataset contains 1,451 videos with about 20,000 annotations, which is

driving safety during both training and testing. The motion predictor estimates
the trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles from kinematic

updates the actions based on safety distance and replaces risky actions, before
sending them to the low-level controller. We train, evaluate and test our

  Scenes","accepted at CVPR2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurately detecting and tracking pedestrians in 3D space is challenging due
to large variations in rotations, poses and scales. The situation becomes even
worse for dense crowds with severe occlusions. However, existing benchmarks
either only provide 2D annotations, or have limited 3D annotations with
low-density pedestrian distribution, making it difficult to build a reliable
pedestrian perception system especially in crowded scenes. To better evaluate
pedestrian perception algorithms in crowded scenarios, we introduce a
large-scale multimodal dataset,STCrowd. Specifically, in STCrowd, there are a
total of 219 K pedestrian instances and 20 persons per frame on average, with
various levels of occlusion. We provide synchronized LiDAR point clouds and
camera images as well as their corresponding 3D labels and joint IDs. STCrowd
can be used for various tasks, including LiDAR-only, image-only, and
sensor-fusion based pedestrian detection and tracking. We provide baselines for
most of the tasks. In addition, considering the property of sparse global
distribution and density-varying local distribution of pedestrians, we further
propose a novel method, Density-aware Hierarchical heatmap Aggregation (DHA),
to enhance pedestrian perception in crowded scenes. Extensive experiments show
that our new method achieves state-of-the-art performance for pedestrian
detection on various datasets.

  Single Equirectangular Projection Image",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  360{\deg} images are widely available over the last few years. This paper
proposes a new technique for single 360{\deg} image depth prediction under open
environments. Depth prediction from a 360{\deg} single image is not easy for
two reasons. One is the limitation of supervision datasets - the currently
available dataset is limited to indoor scenes. The other is the problems caused
by Equirectangular Projection Format (ERP), commonly used for 360{\deg} images,
that are coordinate and distortion. There is only one method existing that uses
cube map projection to produce six perspective images and apply self-supervised
learning using motion pictures for perspective depth prediction to deal with
these problems. Different from the existing method, we directly use the ERP
format. We propose a framework of direct use of ERP with coordinate conversion
of correspondences and distortion-aware upsampling module to deal with the ERP
related problems and extend a self-supervised learning method for open
environments. For the experiments, we firstly built a dataset for the
evaluation, and quantitatively evaluate the depth prediction in outdoor scenes.
We show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art technique

extending the usual definition of category enriched over a monoidal category.
Even though oplax monoidal structures involve infinitely many functors $V^n\to
V$, defining categories enriched over $V$ only requires the lower arity maps
$(n \leq 3)$, similarly to the monoidal case. The focal point of the enrichment
theory shifts, in the oplax case, from the notion of $V$-category (given by
collections of objects and hom-objects together with composition and unit maps)
to the one of categories enriched over $V$ (genuine categories equipped with
additional structures). One of the merits of the notion of categories enriched
over $V$ is that it becomes straightforward to define enriched functors and
natural transformations. We show moreover that the resulting 2-category
$\mathsf{Cat}_V$ can be put in correspondence (via the theory of distributors)
with the 2-category of modules over $V$. We give an example of such an enriched
category in the framework of operads: every cocomplete symmetric monoidal
category $C$ is enriched over the category of sequences in $C$ endowed with an
oplax monoidal structure stemming from the usual operadic composition product,
whose monoids are still the operads. As an application of the study of the
2-functor $V\mapsto\mathsf{Cat}_V$, we show that when $V$ is also endowed with
a compatible lax monoidal structure - thus forming a lax-oplax duoidal category
- the 2-category $\mathsf{Cat}_V$ inherits a lax 2-monoidal structure, thereby
generalising the corresponding result when the enrichment base is a braided
monoidal category. We illustrate this result by discussing the lax-oplax
structure on the category of $(R^\mathrm{e}, R^\mathrm{e})$-bimodules, whose
bimonoids are the bialgebroids. We also comment on the relations with other
enrichment theories (monoidal, multicategories, skew and lax).

the quadratic Riemannian indicatrices in the tangent spaces of a manifold are
replaced by more general convex bodies as unit spheres. A linear connection on
the base manifold is called compatible with the Finsler metric if the induced
parallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of tangent vectors. Finsler
manifolds admitting compatible linear connections are called generalized
Berwald manifolds. Compatible linear connections are the solutions of the
so-called compatibility equations containing the torsion components as
unknowns. Although there are some theoretical results for the solvability of
the compatibility equations (monochromatic Finsler metrics \cite{BM}, extremal
compatible linear connections, algorithmic solutions \cite{V14}), it is very
hard to solve in general because compatible linear connections may or may not
exist on a Finsler manifold and may or may not be unique. Therefore special
cases are of special interest. One of them is the case of the so-called
semi-symmetric compatible linear connection with decomposable torsion tensor.
It is proved \cite{V10} (see also \cite{V11}) that such a compatible linear
connection must be uniquely determined. The original proof is based on
averaging in the sense that the 1-form in the decomposition of the torsion
tensor can be expressed by integrating differential forms on the tangent
manifold over the Finslerian indicatrices. The integral formulas are very
difficult to compute in practice. We present a new proof for the unicity result
by using linear algebra and some basic facts about convex bodies and an
explicit formula for the solution without integration. Necessary conditions of
the solvability are also formulated in terms of intrinsic equations without
unknown quantities. They are sufficient if and only if the solution depends
only on the position.

2015 by one of the present authors in collaboration with Alexander Sorin, which
allows for a more systematic classification and algorithmic construction of
Beltrami flows on torii $\mathbb{R}^3/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a

Universal Classifying Group $\mathfrak{UG}_\Lambda$, is here revised. We
construct the so far missing $\mathfrak{UG}_{\Lambda_{Hex}}$ for the hexagonal

The classification relation between Beltrami Flows and contact structures is
enlightened. The most promising research direction opened by the present work
streams from the fact that the Fourier series expansion of a generic
Navier-Stokes solution can be regrouped into an infinite sum of contributions
$\mathbf{W}_r$, each associated with a spherical layer of quantized radius $r$
in the momentum lattice and consisting of a superposition of a Beltrami and an
anti-Beltrami field, with an analogous decomposition into irreps of the group
$\mathfrak{UG}_\Lambda$ that are variously repeated on higher layers. This
crucial property enables the construction of generic Fourier series with
prescribed hidden symmetries as candidate solutions of the NS equations.

system of MATHEMATICA Codes named \textbf{AlmafluidaNSPsystem} has been
constructed and is now available through the site of the Wolfram Community. The

The merits of the new method are illustrated by some statistical properties

aligns the target garment with the corresponding body parts in the person
image. Prior methods typically adopt a local appearance flow estimation model.
They are thus intrinsically susceptible to difficult body poses/occlusions and
large mis-alignments between person and garment images (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}). To overcome this limitation, a novel global appearance
flow estimation model is proposed in this work. For the first time, a StyleGAN
based architecture is adopted for appearance flow estimation. This enables us
to take advantage of a global style vector to encode a whole-image context to
cope with the aforementioned challenges. To guide the StyleGAN flow generator
to pay more attention to local garment deformation, a flow refinement module is
introduced to add local context. Experiment results on a popular virtual try-on
benchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. It is
particularly effective in a `in-the-wild' application scenario where the
reference image is full-body resulting in a large mis-alignment with the
garment image (Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1} Top). Code is available at:

are largely associated with the existence of a pole of order one in the kinetic

selected logarithmic Kahler potentials K1 and ~K1, which parameterize the same
hyperbolic manifold with scalar curvature R=-2/N, where N>0 is the coefficient
of a logarithmic term. The associated superpotential W exhibits the same R
charge with the inflaton-accompanying superfield and includes all the allowed
renormalizable terms. For K=K1, inflation can be attained for N=2 at the cost
of some tuning regarding the coefficients of the W terms and predicts a
tensor-to-scalar ratio r at the level of 0.001. The tuning can be totally
eluded for K=~K1, which allows for quadratic- and quartic-like models with N
values increasing with r and spectral index ns close or even equal to its
present central observational value.

objective functions limit objective perturbation in general deep learning
tasks. Second, gradient perturbation does not achieve a satisfactory
privacy-utility trade-off due to over-injected noise in each epoch. Third, high
utility of the output perturbation method is not guaranteed because of the
loose upper bound on the global sensitivity of the trained model parameters as
the noise scale parameter. To address these problems, we analyse a tighter
upper bound on the global sensitivity of the model parameters. Under a
black-box setting, based on this global sensitivity, to control the overall
noise injection, we propose a novel output perturbation framework by injecting
DP noise into a randomly sampled neuron (via the exponential mechanism) at the
output layer of a baseline non-private neural network trained with a
convexified loss function. We empirically compare the privacy-utility
trade-off, measured by accuracy loss to baseline non-private models and the
privacy leakage against black-box membership inference (MI) attacks, between
our framework and the open-source differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD) approaches on six commonly used real-world datasets. The
experimental evaluations show that, when the baseline models have observable
privacy leakage under MI attacks, our framework achieves a better
privacy-utility trade-off than existing DP-SGD implementations, given an

estimation accuracy by exploiting data symbols as pilot signals for updating an
initial channel estimate. In this paper, we propose a semi-data-aided channel
estimator for multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. Our
strategy is to leverage reinforcement learning (RL) for selecting reliable
detected symbols among the symbols in the first part of transmitted data block.
This strategy facilitates an update of the channel estimate before the end of
data block transmission and therefore achieves a significant reduction in
communication latency compared to conventional data-aided channel estimation
approaches. Towards this end, we first define a Markov decision process (MDP)
which sequentially decides whether to use each detected symbol as an additional
pilot signal. We then develop an RL algorithm to efficiently find the best
policy of the MDP based on a Monte Carlo tree search approach. In this
algorithm, we exploit the a-posteriori probability for approximating both the
optimal future actions and the corresponding state transitions of the MDP and
derive a closed-form expression for the best policy. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed channel estimator effectively mitigates both
channel estimation error and detection performance loss caused by insufficient
pilot signals.

2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on circulant graphs, i.e. on Cayley
graphs of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$, and prove that the number of rounds
until stabilization is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(d(n)\log n)$, where $d(n)$ is

individualization of two appropriately chosen vertices. Thus, the canonical

astronomical observations and of laboratory experiments with heavy-ion

interacting matter at high baryon densities are also unknown. While
Quantum-Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) calculations on the lattice find a smooth chiral
crossover between hadronic matter and the quark-gluon plasma for high

weights and biases as well as $L$ hidden layers, each of width proportional to

estimates in powers of $1/n$ for the joint cumulants of the network output and
its derivatives. Moreover, we show that network cumulants form a perturbatively
solvable hierarchy in powers of $1/n$ in that $k$-th order cumulants in one
layer have recursions that depend to leading order in $1/n$ only on $j$-th
order cumulants at the previous layer with $j\leq k$. By solving a variety of
such recursions, however, we find that the depth-to-width ratio $L/n$ plays the
role of an effective network depth, controlling both the scale of fluctuations
at individual neurons and the size of inter-neuron correlations. Thus, while
the cumulant recursions we derive form a hierarchy in powers of $1/n$,
contributions of order $1/n^k$ often grow like $L^k$ and are hence
non-negligible at positive $L/n$. We use this to study a somewhat simplified

photon cavity over a wide range of temperature up to room temperature. A key
component of such a system is presented here in the form of a Purcell-enhanced
single-photon source based on Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics, cQED. We use a
real set of pure dephasing data extracted from experimental measurements of
InGaAs QD to calculate the effective QD-cavity coupling strength, the Purcell
factor, and the single photon efficiency emerged from the QD-cavity system in
the cases without and with detuning. In the non-detuned system, the effective
coupling strength between the QD and the resonator decreases with increasing
temperature, results in a decrease in efficiency. However, when the temperature
of the QD-cavity system increases under Purcell effect conditions, the detuned
QD-cavity system induces spontaneous emission rate enhancement. As a result, we
found that the increase in efficiency can be obtained under a certain
condition, when the maximum effective coupling strength and the Purcell factor
are related to the spontaneous emission and the pure dephasing rates.
Additionally, the influences of the pumping mechanism on the efficiency of the
QD-system were examined and showed that the pumping process can be used to
further increase in efficiency. Our results can be advantageous for advanced
quantum optics applications once temperature is taken into account.

  equations on 2D Curved Domains",,,"10.4208/cicp.OA-2022-0106",,"math.NA cs.NA math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This article concerns the weak Galerkin mixed finite element method (WG-MFEM)
for second order elliptic equations on 2D domains with curved boundary. The
Neumann boundary condition is considered since it becomes the essential
boundary condition in this case. It is well-known that the discrepancy between
the curved physical domain and the polygonal approximation domain leads to a
loss of accuracy for discretization with polynomial order $\alpha>1$. The
purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we present a detailed error analysis
of the original WG-MFEM for solving problems on curved domains, which exhibits
an $O(h^{1/2})$ convergence for all $\alpha\ge 1$. It is a little surprising to
see that even the lowest-order WG-MFEM ($\alpha=1$) experiences a loss of
accuracy. This is different from known results for the finite element method
(FEM) or the mixed FEM, and appears to be a combined effect of the WG-MFEM
design and the fact that the outward normal vector on the polygonal
approximation domain is different from the one on the curved domain. Second, we
propose a remedy to bring the approximation rate back to optimal by employing
two techniques. One is a specially designed boundary correction technique. The
other is to take full advantage of the nice feature that weak Galerkin
discretization can be defined on polygonal meshes, which allows the curved
boundary to be better approximated by multiple short edges without increasing
the total number of mesh elements. Rigorous analysis shows that a combination
of the above two techniques renders optimal convergence for all $\alpha$.
Numerical results further confirm this conclusion.

that exist in jets ejected out from active galactic nuclei (AGN). A powerful
source of relativistic particles observed in the centre of the Galaxy and
associated with the rotating supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* can energize
the FB and keeps its active for a long time. The absence of accretion onto a BH
and thus the absence of a relativistic jet does not mean that there is no loss
of rotational energy of BH. In the case of FB, the energy lost by BH can keep
the FB activity. The regular FBs structure could be formed by inheritance from
a relativistic jet that presumably existed in the active past of the Galaxy $
10^7 $ years ago, or by processes near the Galaxy centre existing during the
entire life cycle of the Galaxy. The acceleration of protons in electromagnetic
fields of FB are found up to energies $ E_{max} \simeq 10^{17} $ eV, which

black holes with fine-tuned Lovelock couplings in the regularized theory, which
is needed for our purpose. Next, it is shown that the regularized $4D$
Einstein-Lovelock gravity theories of odd order $N > 3$ do not possess any
physical isolated critical point, unlike the conventional Lovelock gravity. In
fact, the critical (inflection) points of the equation of state always occur
for the branch of black holes with negative entropy. The situation is quite
different for the case of the regularized $4D$ Einstein-Lovelock gravity with
cubic curvature corrections ($N=3$). In this case ($N=3$), although the entropy
is non-negative and the equation of state of hyperbolic vacuum black holes has
a nonstandard Taylor expansion about its inflection point, but there is no
criticality associated with this special point. At the inflection point, the
physical properties of the black hole system change drastically ...

In the first part of the thesis, I investigate how can the collected data from

systems? To investigate the impact of possible dependency in the inter-event
times on the optimal control and performance measures of the system, a
manufacturing system that is controlled by using a single-threshold production
control policy is analyzed. It is shown that ignoring autocorrelation in
inter-arrival or service times leads to overestimation (underestimation) of the
optimal threshold level for negatively (positively) correlated processes. Then,
it is shown that the optimal control policy of a production/inventory system
with correlated inter-arrival and service times modeled as Markovian Arrival
Processes is a state-dependent threshold policy. In the second part of the
thesis, an exploratory data analysis is conducted by using a large industrial
dataset related to the flow of the products at a semiconductor wafer
fabrication. Then, the cycle times of the products are predicted using Machine
Learning methods, and the performance of different prediction algorithms is
assessed. The analytical and empirical results presented in this dissertation
show that effective use of collected data from a manufacturing system enables
controlling the system effectively and predicting its main performance measures
accurately.

fixed (non-switched) and switched structured systems. More precisely, we
consider selecting the minimum cost of inputs from a prior set of inputs, and
selecting the inputs of the smallest possible cost with a bound on their
cardinality, all to ensure system structural controllability. Those problems
have attracted much attention recently; unfortunately, they are NP-hard in
general. In this paper, it is found that, if the input structure satisfies
certain `regularizations', which are characterized by the proposed restricted
total unimodulairty notion, those problems can be solvable in polynomial time
via linear programming (LP) relaxations. Particularly, the obtained
characterizations depend only on the incidence matrix relating the inputs and
the source strongly connected components (SCC) of the system structure,
irrespective of how the inputs actuate states within the same SCC. They cover
all the currently known polynomially solvable cases (such as the dedicated
input case), and contain many new cases unexploited in the past, among which
the source-SCC separated input (SSSI) constraint is highlighted. Further, for
switched systems, the obtained polynomially solvable condition (namely the
joint SSSI constraint) does not require each of the subsystems to satisfy the
SSSI constraint. We achieve these by first formulating those problems as
equivalent integer linear programmings (ILPs), and then proving total
unimodularity of the corresponding constraint matrices. This property allows us
to solve those ILPs efficiently via LP-relaxation. We also discuss solutions
obtained via LP-relaxation and LP-rounding in the general case. Several
examples are given to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.

(NF) is a non-invasive self-brain training technique used for emotion
regulation to enhance brain function and treatment of mental disorders leading
to behavioral changes. Most neurofeedback studies were limited to using the
activity of a single brain region of fMRI data or the power of a single or two
EEG electrodes. In a novel study, we use the connectivity-based EEG
neurofeedback through retrieving positive autobiographical memories and
simultaneous fMRI to upregulate positive emotion. The feedback was calculated
based on the coherence of EEG electrodes rather than the power of single/two
electrodes. We demonstrated the efficiency of the connectivity-based
neurofeedback to traditional activity-based neurofeedback through several
experiments. The results confirmed the effectiveness of connectivity-based
neurofeedback to enhance brain activity/connectivity of deep brain regions with
key roles in emotion regulation e.g., amygdala, thalamus, and insula, and
increase EEG frontal asymmetry as a biomarker for emotion regulation or
treatment of mental disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The
results of psychometric assessments before and after neurofeedback experiments
demonstrated that participants were able to increase positive and decrease
negative emotion using connectivity-based neurofeedback more than traditional
activity-based neurofeedback. The results suggest using the connectivity-based
neurofeedback for emotion regulation and alternative therapeutic approaches for
mental disorders with more effectiveness and higher volitional ability to

major variant of such attacks is poisoning attacks which can indirectly

of proposed effective defense models are only effective when an attacker is not

De-Pois defense is hardly an exception to that rule. In fact, we demonstrate
its vulnerability to the simplest White-Box and Black-Box attacks by an
attacker that knows the structure of the De-Pois defense model. In essence, the
De-Pois defense relies on a critic model that can be used to detect poisoned
data before passing it to the target model. In our work, we break this
poison-protection layer by replicating the critic model and then performing a
composed gradient-sign attack on both the critic and target models
simultaneously -- allowing us to bypass the critic firewall to poison the

this paper, a novel hierarchical FC approach is proposed to allow HPPs to
provide three types of FCSs, namely fast frequency response (FFR), frequency
containment response (FCR) and frequency restoration response (FRR). To
accommodate state-of-the-art fast FC, controllers for fast FCSs, such as FFR
and FCR, are implemented at asset controllers, while controllers for slow FCSs
like FRR are implemented at plant controllers or the HPP controller (HPPC).
Control counteraction issue, which arises across control hierarchy, is then
discussed. To solve this issue, an innovative frequency response observer
(FROB) is proposed. Inspired by the concept of disturbance observer (DOB), FROB
at plant controllers and the HPPC accurately estimates frequency response
initiated at asset controllers, and the obtained estimation is used for control
compensation at plant controllers and the HPPC to avoid control counteraction.
This scheme achieves robust performance even when there are system
uncertainties existing in HPPs, such as parameter uncertainty, unknown control
malfunction, and time-varying communication delays. The proposed approach is
implemented in a power system dynamic model in MATLAB/Simulink to highlight its
effectiveness and robustness.

the upcoming Sixth Generation (6G) of communication systems. The use of
collimated beams at mmW/sub-THz to compensate for the increased path and
penetration loss arises the need for a seamless Beam Management (BM),
especially for high mobility scenarios such as the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I) one. Recent research advances in Integrated Sensing and Communication
(ISAC) indicate that equipping the network infrastructure, e.g., the Base
Station (BS), with either a stand-alone radar or sensing capabilities using
optimized waveforms, represents the killer technology to facilitate the BM.
However, radio sensing should accurately localize the Vehicular Equipment
(VE)'s antenna, which is not guaranteed in general. Differently, employing side
information from VE's onboard positioning sensors might overcome this
limitation at the price of an increased control signaling between VE and BS.
This paper provides a pragmatic comparison between radar-assisted and
position-assisted BM for mmW V2I systems in a typical urban scenario in terms
of BM training time and beamforming gain loss due to a wrong BM decision.
Simulation results, supported by experimental evidence, show that the point
target approximation of a traveling VE does not hold in practical V2I scenarios
with radar-equipped BS. Therefore, the true antenna position has a residual
uncertainty that is independent of radar's resolution and implies 50\,\% more
BM training time on average. Moreover, there is not a winning technology for BM
between BS-mounted radar and VE's onboard positioning systems. They provide
complementary performance, depending on position, although outperforming blind
BM techniques compared to conventional blind methods. Thus, we propose to
optimally combine radar and positioning information in a multi-technology
integrated BM solution.

  via Explainable AI Systems","Under review",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern applications such as self-driving cars and drones rely heavily upon
robust object detection techniques. However, weather corruptions can hinder the
object detectability and pose a serious threat to their navigation and
reliability. Thus, there is a need for efficient denoising, deraining, and
restoration techniques. Generative adversarial networks and transformers have
been widely adopted for image restoration. However, the training of these
methods is often unstable and time-consuming. Furthermore, when used for object
detection (OD), the output images generated by these methods may provide
unsatisfactory results despite image clarity. In this work, we propose a
contrastive approach towards mitigating this problem, by evaluating images
generated by restoration models during and post training. This approach
leverages OD scores combined with attention maps for predicting the usefulness
of restored images for the OD task. We conduct experiments using two novel
use-cases of conditional GANs and two transformer methods that probe the
robustness of the proposed approach on multi-weather corruptions in the OD
task. Our approach achieves an averaged 178 percent increase in mAP between the
input and restored images under adverse weather conditions like dust tornadoes
and snowfall. We report unique cases where greater denoising does not improve
OD performance and conversely where noisy generated images demonstrate good
results. We conclude the need for explainability frameworks to bridge the gap
between human and machine perception, especially in the context of robust
object detection for autonomous vehicles.

by the multiple collective members into a single solution is essential for
exploiting the collective's intelligence and for effective crowdsourcing. There
are various aggregation techniques, some of which come down to a simple and
sometimes effective deterministic aggregation rule. However, it has been shown
that the efficiency of those techniques is unstable under varying conditions
and within different domains. Other methods mainly rely on learning from the
decision-makers previous responses or the availability of additional
information about them. In this study, we present two one-shot
machine-learning-based aggregation approaches. The first predicts, given
multiple features about the collective's choices, including meta-cognitive
ones, which aggregation method will be best for a given case. The second
directly predicts which decision is optimal, given, among other things, the
selection made by each method. We offer a meta-cognitive feature-engineering
approach for characterizing a collective decision-making case in a
context-sensitive fashion. In addition, we offer a new aggregation method, the
Devil's-Advocate aggregator, to deal with cases in which standard aggregation
methods are predicted to fail. Experimental results show that using either of
our proposed approaches increases the percentage of successfully aggregated
cases (i.e., cases in which the correct answer is returned) significantly,
compared to the uniform application of each rule-based aggregation method. We
also demonstrate the importance of the Devil's Advocate aggregator.

beneficial for this task. Our proposed method, MADA, explicitly focuses on two
modalities other than the audio itself, namely, the underlying emotions
expressed in the abusive audio and the semantic information encapsulated in the

over audio-only approaches on the ADIMA dataset. We test the proposed approach
on 10 different languages and observe consistent gains in the range 0.6%-5.2%

increasing survival rate when diagnosed at early stages. Learning-based methods
hold significant promise for the detection of melanoma from dermoscopic images.
However, since melanoma is a rare disease, existing databases of skin lesions
predominantly contain highly imbalanced numbers of benign versus malignant
samples. In turn, this imbalance introduces substantial bias in classification
models due to the statistical dominance of the majority class. To address this
issue, we introduce a deep clustering approach based on the latent-space
embedding of dermoscopic images. Clustering is achieved using a novel
center-oriented margin-free triplet loss (COM-Triplet) enforced on image
embeddings from a convolutional neural network backbone. The proposed method
aims to form maximally-separated cluster centers as opposed to minimizing
classification error, so it is less sensitive to class imbalance. To avoid the
need for labeled data, we further propose to implement COM-Triplet based on
pseudo-labels generated by a Gaussian mixture model. Comprehensive experiments
show that deep clustering with COM-Triplet loss outperforms clustering with
triplet loss, and competing classifiers in both supervised and unsupervised
settings.

nontrivial properties of ordinal arithmetic, which then enable us to expand
normal modal logic's semantics naturally and elegantly onto the novel
transfinite modal logic, while still keeping the ordinary definition of Kripke
models totally intact. Despite all the transfinite mathematical definition, we
argue that in practice, this logic can actually fit into a completely finite

essence of Bayesian reasoning in a rather clear and simple form, in particular,
it provides a perfect explanation for Sherlock Holmes' famous saying, ""When you
have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be
the truth."" We also prove a counterpart of finite model property theorem for

Priority (PIP) for CTCVR estimation, where there is a risk that the ESMM
overlooks the causality from click to conversion. To this end, we devise a
principled approach named Entire Space Counterfactual Multi-task Modelling

ESMM to address both IEB and PIP issues simultaneously. Extensive experiments
on offline datasets and online environments demonstrate that our proposed
ESCM$^2$ can largely mitigate the inherent IEB and PIP issues and achieve
better performance than baseline models.

depth is provided by a zone of lateral soil failure. We also found that the
articulation translates a horizontal draft force into a vertical penetration
force strong enough to penetrate a narrow spike to a depth where the soil can
sustain the draft force, in a self-regulating way. It is conceivable that a
granular material like regolith or sand with little to no cohesive strength
provides less vertical penetration resistance and less resistance to a
horizontal draft force than a cohesive soil, which leads to the question of
whether and how much tractive force an interlocking spike can generate on a
granular material. Here we report on field trials that study different spike
designs in dry and unsaturated moist sand. The results demonstrate that a loose
granular material requires larger spikes than a cohesive soil, that these
larger spikes penetrate dry and moist sand reliably, and that they promise good
