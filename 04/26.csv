  Nernst-Planck model",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Charge dynamics play essential role in many practical applications such as
semiconductors, electrochemical devices and transmembrane ion channels. A
Maxwell-Amp\`{e}re Nernst-Planck (MANP) model that describes charge dynamics
via concentrations and the electric displacement is able to take effects beyond
mean-field approximations into account. To obtain physically faithful numerical
solutions, we develop a structure-preserving numerical method for the MANP
model whose solution has several physical properties of importance. By the
Slotboom transform with entropic-mean approximations, a positivity preserving
scheme with Scharfetter-Gummel fluxes is derived for the generalized
Nernst-Planck equations. To deal with the curl-free constraint, the dielectric
displacement from the Maxwell-Amp\`{e}re equation is further updated with a
local relaxation algorithm of linear computational complexity. We prove that
the proposed numerical method unconditionally preserves the mass conservation
and the solution positivity at the discrete level, and satisfies the discrete
energy dissipation law with a time-step restriction. Numerical experiments
verify that our numerical method has expected accuracy and structure-preserving
properties. Applications to ion transport with large convection, arising from
boundary-layer electric field and Born solvation interactions, further
demonstrate that the MANP formulation with the proposed numerical scheme has
attractive performance and can effectively describe charge dynamics with large
convection of high numerical cell P\'{e}clet numbers.

contrast at 300 [mas] and FWHM of the non-coronagraphic PSF, for a total of 111
different stars observed between 2016 and 2022 with IRDIS. For this, we
processed a large number of individual frames that were obtained under
different atmospheric conditions. We then compared the resulting raw contrast
and the PSF shape as a function of the visible wave front sensor instant flux
which scales with the G-band stellar magnitude. We repeated this analysis for
the top 10\% and 30\% best turbulence conditions in Cerro Paranal. Results: We
found a strong decrease in the coronagraphic achievable contrast for star
fainter than G $\sim$ 12.5 mag, even under the best atmospheric conditions. In
this regime, the AO correction is dominated by the read-out noise of the WFS
detector. In particular we found roughly a factor ten decrease in the raw
contrast ratio between stars with G $\sim$ 12.5 and G $\sim$ 14.0 mag.
Similarly, we observe a sharp increase in the FWHM of the non-coronagraphic PSF
beyond G $\sim$ 12.5 mag, and a corresponding decrease in the strehl ratio from
$\sim$ 50\% to $\sim$ 20\% for the faintest stars. Although these trend are

Specifically, there has been little consideration of the interplay between
local tissue geometry and cellular properties influencing larger scale tissue
behaviours. Here we consider a simple two dimensional computational vertex
model for confluent tissue monolayers, which exhibits a rigidity phase
transition controlled by the shape index (ratio of perimeter to square root

We also find that the radial location of the peak polarized intensity differs
on either side of the star by 11 AU, suggesting that the disk may be eccentric,
although, such an eccentricity does not fully explain the large brightness and
radial asymmetry observed. Observations of the disk halo with HST also show the
disk to be warped at larger separations, with a bifurcation feature in the
northwest, further suggesting that there may be a planet in this system
creating an asymmetrical disk structure. Measuring the disk color shows that
the brighter extension is bluer compared to the dimmer extension, suggesting
that the two sides have different dust grain properties. This finding, along
with the large brightness asymmetry, are consistent with the hypothesis that a
giant impact occurred between two large bodies in the northern extension of the

for plate pattern irregularities, which is time-consuming and prone to human

Advances in deep learning-driven computer vision has led to the exploration of
automated visual quality inspection of light guide plates to improve inspection
consistency, accuracy, and efficiency. However, given the cost constraints in
visual inspection scenarios, the widespread adoption of deep learning-driven

potentially be remedied by introducing F12 explicit correlation: we investigate
the basis set convergence of both DHDFT and DHDFT-F12 for the large and

noncovalent interactions) benchmark suite. The B2GP-PLYP-D3(BJ) and
revDSD-PBEP86-D4 double hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) are investigated as
test cases, together with orbital basis sets as large as aug-cc-pV5Z and F12
basis sets as large as cc-pV(Q+d)Z-F12. We show that F12 greatly accelerates
basis set convergence of DHDFs, to the point that even the modest cc-pVDZ-F12
basis set is closer to the basis set limit than cc-pV(Q+d)Z or def2-QZVPP in
orbital-based approaches, and in fact comparable in quality to cc-pV(5+d)Z.
Somewhat surprisingly, aug-cc-pVDZ-F12 is not required even for the anionic

convergence in both the development and application of double-hybrid

circumvented by localized pair natural orbital approximations, which also
exhibit much gentler system size scaling.

  II","Sometimes size does not matter","31 pages, 1 table",,,,"physics.hist-ph astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Cosmological fine-tuning has traditionally been associated with the
narrowness of the intervals in which the parameters of the physical models must
be located to make life possible. A more thorough approach focuses on the
probability of the interval, not on its size. Most attempts to measure the
probability of the life-permitting interval for a given parameter rely on a
Bayesian statistical approach for which the prior distribution of the parameter
is uniform. However, the parameters in these models often take values in spaces
of infinite size, so that a uniformity assumption is not possible. This is
known as the normalization problem. This paper explains a framework to measure
tuning that, among others, deals with normalization, assuming that the prior
distribution belongs to a class of maximum entropy (maxent) distributions. By
analyzing an upper bound of the tuning probability for this class of
distributions the method solves the so-called weak anthropic principle, and
offer a solution, at least in this context, to the well-known lack of
invariance of maxent distributions. The implication of this approach is that,
since all mathematical models need parameters, tuning is not only a question of
natural science, but also a problem of mathematical modeling. Cosmological
tuning is thus a particular instantiation of a more general scenario.
Therefore, whenever a mathematical model is used to describe nature, not only
in physics but in all of science, tuning is present. And the question of
whether the tuning is fine or coarse for a given parameter -- if the interval
in which the parameter is located has low or high probability, respectively --
depends crucially not only on the interval but also on the assumed class of
prior distributions. Novel upper bounds for tuning probabilities are presented.

Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) constraints. The robots and objects evolve subject
to uncertain dynamics in an obstacle-cluttered environment. The key part of the
proposed solution is the intelligent construction of a coupled transition
system that encodes the motion and tasks of the robots and the objects. We
achieve such a construction by designing appropriate adaptive control protocols
in the lower level, which guarantee the safe robot navigation/object
transportation in the environment while compensating for the dynamic
uncertainties. The transition system is efficiently interfaced with the
temporal logic specification via a sampling-based algorithm to output a
discrete path as a sequence of synchronized actions of the robots; such actions
satisfy the robots' as well as the objects' specifications. The robots execute
this discrete path by using the derived low level control protocol. Simulation
results verify the proposed framework.

using the weighted essentially non-oscillatory with adaptive-order (WENO-AO)
method for spatial reconstruction and the two-stage fourth-order scheme for
time evolution. Since the UGKS updates both the macroscopic flow variables and
microscopic distribution function, and provides an adaptive flux function by
combining the equilibrium and non-equilibrium parts, it is possible to take
separate treatment of the equilibrium and non-equilibrium calculation in the
UGKS for the development of high-order scheme. Considering the fact that
high-order techniques are commonly required for continuum flow with complex
structures, and the rarefied flow structure are relatively simple and smooth in
the physical space, we apply the high-order techniques in the equilibrium part
of the UGKS for the capturing of macroscopic flow evolution, and retain the
calculation of distribution function as a second-order method, so that a
balance of computational cost and numerical accuracy could be well achieved.
The high-order UGKS has been validated by several numerical test cases,
including sine-wave accuracy test, sod-shock tube, Couette, oscillating
Couette, lid-driven cavity and oscillating cavity flow. It is shown that the
current method preserves the multiscale property of the original UGKS and
obtains more accurate solutions in several cases.

SyntaSpeech to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker text-to-speech.
Ablation studies demonstrate the necessity of each component in SyntaSpeech.

of this problem are two folds: 1) Data samples ceaselessly flowing in may carry
shifted patterns over time, requiring learners to update hence adapt
on-the-fly. 2) Newly emerging features are described by very few samples,
resulting in weak learners that tend to make error predictions. A plausible
idea to overcome the challenges is to establish relationship between the
pre-and-post evolving feature spaces, so that an online learner can leverage
the knowledge learned from the old features to better the learning performance
on the new features. Unfortunately, this idea does not scale up to
high-dimensional media streams with complex feature interplay, which suffers an
tradeoff between onlineness (biasing shallow learners) and
expressiveness(requiring deep learners). Motivated by this, we propose a novel
OLD^3S paradigm, where a shared latent subspace is discovered to summarize
information from the old and new feature spaces, building intermediate feature
mapping relationship. A key trait of OLD^3S is to treat the model capacity as a
learnable semantics, yields optimal model depth and parameters jointly, in
accordance with the complexity and non-linearity of the input data streams in
an online fashion. Both theoretical analyses and empirical studies substantiate
the viability and effectiveness of our proposal.

activities, is the gold standard for diagnosing cardiovascular disease (CVD).
However, ECG is infeasible for continuous cardiac monitoring due to its
requirement for user participation. By contrast, photoplethysmography (PPG)
provides easy-to-collect data, but its limited accuracy constrains its clinical
usage. To combine the advantages of both signals, recent studies incorporate
various deep learning techniques for the reconstruction of PPG signals to ECG;
however, the lack of contextual information as well as the limited abilities to
denoise biomedical signals ultimately constrain model performance. In this
research, we propose Performer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that
reconstructs ECG from PPG and combines the PPG and reconstructed ECG as
multiple modalities for CVD detection. This method is the first time that
Transformer sequence-to-sequence translation has been performed on biomedical
waveform reconstruction, combining the advantages of both PPG and ECG. We also
create Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA), an effective method to
encode/decode the biomedical waveforms. Through fetching the various sequence
lengths and capturing cross-patch connections, SPA maximizes the signal
processing for both local features and global contextual representations. The
proposed architecture generates a state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for
the reconstruction of PPG to ECG on the BIDMC database, surpassing prior
studies. We also evaluated this model on the MIMIC-III dataset, achieving a
95.9% accuracy in CVD detection, and on the PPG-BP dataset, achieving 75.9%
accuracy in related CVD diabetes detection, indicating its generalizability. As

vector addition systems with a pushdown store. A PVASS is said to be
\emph{bidirected} if every transition (pushing/popping a symbol or modifying a
counter) has an accompanying opposite transition that reverses the effect.
Bidirectedness arises naturally in many models; it can also be seen as a
overapproximation of reachability. We show that the reachability problem for
\emph{bidirected} PVASS is decidable in Ackermann time and primitive recursive
for any fixed dimension. For the special case of one-dimensional bidirected
PVASS, we show reachability is in $\mathsf{PSPACE}$, and in fact in polynomial
time if the stack is polynomially bounded. Our results are in contrast to the
\emph{directed} setting, where decidability of reachability is a long-standing
open problem already for one dimensional PVASS, and there is a
$\mathsf{PSPACE}$-lower bound already for one-dimensional PVASS with bounded
stack.
  The reachability relation in the bidirected (stateless) case is a congruence
over $\mathbb{N}^d$. Our upper bounds exploit saturation techniques over
congruences. In particular, we show novel elementary-time constructions of
semilinear representations of congruences generated by finitely many vector
pairs. In the case of one-dimensional PVASS, we employ a saturation procedure
over bounded-size counters.
  We complement our upper bound with a $\mathsf{TOWER}$-hardness result for
arbitrary dimension and $k$-$\mathsf{EXPSPACE}$ hardness in dimension $2k+6$

applicable to information theory when all random variables involved are linear
functions of the individual bits of a source of independent bits.
  We say that a collection of subspaces of a vector space are ""coordinated"" if
the vector space has a basis such that each subspace is spanned by its
intersection with the basis. We measure the failure of a collection of
subspaces to be coordinated by an invariant that we call the ""discoordination""
of the family. We develop some foundational results regarding discoordination.
In particular, these results give a number of new formulas involving three
subspaces of a vector space.
  We then apply a number of our results, along with a method of Tian to obtain
some new lower bounds in a special case of the basic coded caching problem. In
terms of the usual notation for these problems, we show that for $N=3$
documents and $K=3$ caches, we have $6M+5R\ge 11$ for a scheme that achieves
the memory-rate pair $(M,R)$, assuming the scheme is linear. We also give a new
caching scheme for $N=K=3$ that achieves the pair $(M,R) = (1/2,5/3)$.

synthesis tasks. Though they can generate highly natural human speech, the
iterative generation inevitably makes the synthesis time proportional to the
utterance's length, leading to low efficiency. Many works were dedicated to
generating the whole speech time sequence in parallel and then proposed
GAN-based, flow-based, and score-based models. This paper proposed a new
thought for the autoregressive generation. Instead of iteratively predicting
samples in a time sequence, the proposed model performs frequency-wise
autoregressive generation (FAR) and bit-wise autoregressive generation (BAR) to
synthesize speech. In FAR, a speech utterance is first split into different
frequency subbands. The proposed model generates a subband conditioned on the
previously generated one. A full band speech can then be reconstructed by using
these generated subbands and a synthesis filter bank. Similarly, in BAR, an
8-bit quantized signal is generated iteratively from the first bit. By
redesigning the autoregressive method to compute in domains other than the time
domain, the number of iterations in the proposed model is no longer
proportional to the utterance's length but the number of subbands/bits. The
inference efficiency is hence significantly increased. Besides, a post-filter
is employed to sample audio signals from output posteriors, and its training
objective is designed based on the characteristics of the proposed
autoregressive methods. The experimental results show that the proposed model
is able to synthesize speech faster than real-time without GPU acceleration.
Compared with the baseline autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, the
proposed model achieves better MOS and shows its good generalization ability
while synthesizing 44 kHz speech or utterances from unseen speakers.

good approximations of the multi-component fluid for small perturbations and
when the non-equilibrium equation of state of the fluid depends on only one
independent particle fraction. For more than one independent particle fraction
and for large perturbations, the bulk stress approximation is still valid but
less accurate. In addition, we include the energy loss due to the luminosity of
the reactions in the bulk stress formulation. We find that the energy loss due
to bulk viscosity has a larger effect on the dynamics than the bulk stress or
the variation in particle composition per se. The new one-dimensional,

present a stress-only theory of emergent elasticity for a non-thermal amorphous
assembly of grains in a jammed solid, where each grain is subjected to
mechanical constraints of force and torque balance. These grain-level
constraints lead to the Gauss's law of an emergent $U(1)$ tensor
electromagnetism, which then accounts for the mechanical response of such
solids. This formulation of amorphous elasticity has several immediate
consequences. The mechanical response maps exactly to the static, dielectric
response of this tensorial electromagnetism with the polarizability of the
medium mapping to emergent elastic moduli. External forces act as vector
electric charges whereas the tensorial magnetic fields are sourced by momentum
density. The dynamics in the electric and magnetic sectors, naturally translate
into the dynamics of the rigid jammed network and ballistic particle motion
respectively. The theoretical predictions for both stress-stress correlations

frictionless granular packings in the static limit of the theory in both 2D and

We test convolutional neural networks for retrieving a planet's rotation axis,
surface and cloud map from simulated single-pixel flux and polarization
observations. We investigate the assumption that the planets reflect Lambertian
in the retrieval while their actual reflection is bidirectional, and of
including polarization in retrievals. We simulate observations along a planet's
orbit using a radiative transfer algorithm that includes polarization and
bidirectional reflection by vegetation, desert, oceans, water clouds, and
Rayleigh scattering in 6 spectral bands from 400 to 800 nm, at various photon
noise levels. The surface-types and cloud patterns of the facets covering a
model planet are based on probability distributions. Our networks are trained
with simulated observations of millions of planets before retrieving maps of
test planets. The neural networks can constrain rotation axes with a mean
squared error (MSE) as small as 0.0097, depending on the orbital inclination.
On a bidirectionally reflecting planet, 92% of ocean and 85% of vegetation,
desert, and cloud facets are correctly retrieved, in the absence of noise. With
realistic noise, it should still be possible to retrieve the main map features
with a dedicated telescope. Except for face-on orbits, a network trained with
Lambertian reflecting planets, yields significant retrieval errors when given
observations of bidirectionally reflecting planets, in particular, brightness
artefacts around a planet's pole. Including polarization improves retrieving
the rotation axis and the accuracy of the retrieval of ocean and cloud facets.

distributions of electric charge and magnetic moment at fixed light-front time
and connect the nucleon's elastic form factors with its partonic structure. The
dispersive representation of the form factors $F_{1, 2}(t)$ expresses the
densities in terms of exchanges of hadronic states in the $t$-channel and
permits their analysis using hadronic physics methods.
  Purpose: Compute the densities at peripheral distances $b =
\mathcal{O}(M_\pi^{-1})$, where they are generated predominantly by the
two-pion states in the dispersive representation. Quantify the uncertainties.
  Methods: Dispersively improved chiral effective field theory (DI$\chi$EFT) is
used to calculate the isovector spectral functions $\textrm{Im}\, F_{1, 2}(t)$
on the two-pion cut. The method includes $\pi\pi$ interactions ($\rho$
resonance) through elastic unitarity and provides realistic spectral functions
up to $t \approx$ 1 GeV$^2$. Higher-mass states are parametrized by effective
poles and constrained by sum rules (charges, radii, superconvergence
relations). The densities $\rho_{1, 2}(b)$ are obtained from their dispersive
representation. Uncertainties are quantified by varying the spectral functions.
The method respects analyticity and ensures the correct $b \rightarrow \infty$
asymptotic behavior of the densities.
  Results: Accurate densities are obtained at all distances $b \gtrsim 0.5$ fm,
with correct behavior down to $b \rightarrow 0$. The region of distances is
quantified where transverse nucleon structure is governed by the two-pion
state. The light-front current distributions in the polarized nucleon are
computed and discussed.
  Conclusions: Peripheral nucleon structure can be computed from first
principles using DI$\chi$EFT. The method can be extended to generalized parton
distributions and other nucleon form factors.

primordial black hole merger rate density is expected to rise monotonically
with redshift, while Population~III mergers can only occur after the birth of
the first stars. Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic

close-in orbits. If this ``Neptune desert' is entirely cleared out by
atmospheric mass loss, then planets at its upper edge should only be marginally
stable against photoevaporation, exhibiting strong outflow signatures in
tracers like the metastable helium triplet. We test this hypothesis by carrying
out a 12-night photometric survey of the metastable helium feature with
Palomar/WIRC, targeting seven gas-giant planets orbiting K-type host stars.
Eight nights of data are analyzed here for the first time along with reanalyses
of four previously-published datasets. We strongly detect helium absorption
signals for WASP-69b, HAT-P-18b, and HAT-P-26b; tentatively detect signals for
WASP-52b and NGTS-5b; and do not detect signals for WASP-177b and WASP-80b. We
interpret these measured excess absorption signals using grids of Parker wind
models to derive mass-loss rates, which are in good agreement with predictions
from the hydrodynamical outflow code ATES for all planets except WASP-52b and
WASP-80b, where our data suggest that the outflows are much smaller than
predicted. Excluding these two planets, the outflows for the rest of the sample
are consistent with a mean energy-limited outflow efficiency of $\varepsilon =

determined and we find mass distributions in the ranges 6.1 to 22.3 Solar
masses for RSGs and 3.7 to 15.6 Solar masses for their companions. The most
massive RSG binary system in the SMC has a combined mass of 32 $\pm$4
M$_\odot$, with a mass ratio (q) of 0.92. By simulating observing biases, we
find an intrinsic multipliciy fraction of 18.8 $\pm$ 1.5% for mass ratios in
the range 0.3 < q < 1.0 and orbital periods approximately in the range 3 < log
P [days] < 8. By comparing our results with those of a similar mass on the

that the orbital period distribution declines rapidly beyond log P ~ 3.5. We
study the mass-ratio distribution of RSG binary systems and find that a uniform

scalar field theories, is an important phenomenon in early universe cosmology.
Recently, real-time semi-classical techniques based on ensembles of lattice
simulations were applied to the problem of false vacuum decay. In this context,
or any other lattice simulation, the effective potential experienced by
long-wavelength modes is not the same as the bare potential. To make
quantitative predictions using the real-time semi-classical techniques, it is
therefore necessary to understand the redefinition of model parameters and the
corresponding deformation of the vacuum state, as well as stochastic
contributions that require modeling of unresolved subgrid modes. In this work,
we focus on the former corrections and compute the expected modification of the
true and false vacuum effective mass, which manifests as a modified dispersion
relationship for linear fluctuations about the vacuum. We compare these
theoretical predictions to numerical simulations and find excellent agreement.
Motivated by this, we use the effective masses to fix the shape of a
parameterized effective potential, and explore the modeling uncertainty
associated with non-linear corrections. We compute the decay rates in both the
Euclidean and real-time formalisms, finding qualitative agreement in the
dependence on the UV cutoff. These calculations further demonstrate that a
quantitative understanding of the rates requires additional corrections.

on the conditions under which fast flavor conversion is enhanced or suppressed

the absence of spatial inhomogeneities, we consider two angular configurations:
The first one with angular distributions of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ that are
almost isotropic as expected before complete neutrino decoupling and showing
little flavor conversion when collisions are absent. The second one with
angular distributions of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ that are forward peaked as

direction-changing collisions, we find that collisions are responsible for an
overall enhancement (damping) of flavor conversion in the former (latter)
angular configuration. These opposite outcomes are due to the non-trivial
interplay between collisions, flavor conversion, and the initial angular
distributions of the electron type neutrinos. The enhancement in neutrino
flavor conversion is found to be anticorrelated with the magnitude of flavor
conversions in the absence of collisions.

Ensuring criticality awareness for diverse functional safety applications and
providing fault tolerance in an autonomous manner are essential for future 6G
systems. Therefore, this paper proposes jointly employing the concepts of
resilience and mixed criticality. In this work, we conduct physical layer
resource management in cloud-based networks under the rate-splitting paradigm,
which is a promising factor towards achieving high resilience. We recapitulate
the concepts individually, outline a joint metric to measure the
criticality-aware resilience, and verify its merits in a case study. We,
thereby, formulate a non-convex optimization problem, derive an efficient
iterative algorithm, propose four resilience mechanisms differing in quality
and time of adaption, and conduct extensive numerical simulations. Towards this
end, we propose a highly autonomous rate-splitting-enabled physical layer
resource management algorithm for future 6G networks respecting mixed-critical
quality of service (QoS) levels and providing high levels of resilience.
Results emphasize the considerable improvements of incorporating a mixed
criticality-aware resilience strategy under channel outages and strict QoS
demands. The rate-splitting paradigm is particularly shown to overcome
state-of-the-art interference management techniques, and the resilience and
throughput adaption over consecutive outage events reveals the proposed schemes

Lya halos do not show ordered motion in their velocity fields, whereas most of
the [CII] velocity fields do. In those cases where a velocity gradient can be

While optical observations suggest little ongoing star formation, some have

suggestion that gas depletion is not required to end the starburst, and that
star formation is suppressed by other processes. We present NOEMA CO(1-0)

Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) photoionization. We collect post-starburst
candidates with molecular gas measurements from the literature, with some
classified as classical E+A, while others with line ratios consistent with AGN

fact obscured star formation, with some systems showing star formation rates

of 26 (26\%) host obscured starbursts. Using far-infrared observations,
post-starburst candidates show similar SFR-$M_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ and

quenching by processes other than the consumption of molecular gas by star

entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation in the absence of island surface
is increasing linearly with time. After including contribution from the island
surface, we find that after the Page time, entanglement entropy of the Hawking

Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole and we obtain the Page curves. We
find that Page curves appear at later or earlier time when the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling increases or decreases. Further, scrambling time of
Reissner-Nordstr\""om is increasing or decreasing depending upon whether the
correction term (coming from ${\cal O}(R^2)$ terms in the gravitational action)
is increasing or decreasing in the first case whereas scrambling time remains
unaffected in the second case (Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case). As a

and feedback. As for the latter, we keep as reference the model setup

star formation efficiency with the local dust to gas ratio would better
reproduce the observed evolution of the cosmic star formation density.
Moreover, the paucity of quenched galaxies at low redshift demands a stronger
role of AGN feedback. We tune the parameters ruling direct dust production from
evolved stars and accretion in the inter stellar medium to get scaling
relations involving dust, stellar mass and metallicity in good agreement with
observations. In low mass galaxies the accretion process is inefficient. As a
consequence, they remain poorer in silicate and small grains than higher mass
ones. We reproduce reasonably well the few available data on the radial
distribution of dust outside the galactic region, supporting the assumption
that the dust and gas dynamics are well coupled at galactic scales.

generalization of MUBs called mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs). These
measurements inherit the essential property of complementarity from MUBs, but
the Hilbert space dimension is no longer required to match the number of
outcomes. This operational complementarity property renders MUMs highly useful
for device-independent quantum information processing. It has been shown that
MUMs are strictly more general than MUBs. In this work we provide a complete
proof of the characterization of MUMs that are direct sums of MUBs. We then
proceed to construct new examples of MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. A
crucial technical tool for these construction is a correspondence with
quaternionic Hadamard matrices, which allows us to map known examples of such
matrices to MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. Furthermore, we show that --
in stark contrast with MUBs -- the number of MUMs for a fixed outcome number is
unbounded. Next, we focus on the use of MUMs in quantum communication. We
demonstrate how any pair of MUMs with d outcomes defines a d-dimensional
superdense coding protocol. Using MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs, we
disprove a recent conjecture due to Nayak and Yuen on the rigidity of
superdense coding for infinitely many dimensions.

studied in recent years. Closing the domain gap between the source (synthetic)

progressively train a multi-scale neural network to perform image translation
from the source domain to the target domain. We denote the new transformed data
as ""Source in Target"" (SiT). Then, we insert the generated SiT data as the
input to any standard UDA approach. This new data has a reduced domain gap from
the desired target domain, which facilitates the applied UDA approach to close
the gap further. We emphasize the effectiveness of our method via a comparison
to other leading UDA and image-to-image translation techniques when used as SiT
generators. Moreover, we demonstrate the improvement of our framework with
three state-of-the-art UDA methods for semantic segmentation, HRDA, DAFormer

previous study, it was assumed that the dark photon has a St\""uckelberg mass,
or a mass generated by the Higgs mechanism with a sufficiently heavy Higgs
boson. In this paper we consider a case in which the Higgs boson is not fully
decoupled; the Higgs field changes its vacuum expectation value after
inflation. Then, the dark photon mass also changes with time after inflation,
and the time evolution of the longitudinal mode is different from the case with
a St\""{u}ckelberg mass. Consequently, the spectrum of the dark photon energy
density can have two peaks at an intermediate scale and a small scale. We show
that the dark photon can explain the dark matter if its current mass is larger
than $6 \, \mu {\rm eV} \times (H_I / 10^{14} \, {\rm GeV})^{-4}$ and smaller
than $0.8 \, {\rm GeV} \times (H_I / 10^{14} \, {\rm GeV})^{-3/2}$, with $H_I$
being the Hubble parameter during inflation. A higher mass is required if one
considers a larger gauge coupling constant. The result for the St\""uckelberg
mass can be reproduced in the limit of a small gauge coupling constant. We also
comment on the constraints set by various conjectures in quantum gravity

algorithm. However, existing meta-learning methods either only work with
differentiable algorithms or are hand-crafted to improve one specific component
of an algorithm. We develop a unifying meta-learning framework, called
Reinforcement Teaching, to improve the learning process of any algorithm. Under
Reinforcement Teaching, a teaching policy is learned, through reinforcement, to
improve a student's learning. To effectively learn such a teaching policy, we
introduce a parametric-behavior embedder that learns a representation of the
student's learnable parameters from its input/output behavior. Further, we use
learning progress to shape the teacher's reward, allowing it to more quickly
maximize the student's performance. To demonstrate the generality of
Reinforcement Teaching, we conduct experiments where a teacher learns to
significantly improve both reinforcement and supervised learning algorithms,
outperforming hand-crafted heuristics and previously proposed parameter
representations. Results show that Reinforcement Teaching is capable of not
only unifying different meta-learning approaches, but also effectively
leveraging existing tools from reinforcement learning research.

flavor-singlet quark helicity distributions in the shock wave ($s$-channel)

evolution equation for the gluon field-strength $F^{12}$ and quark ""axial
current"" ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$ operators (sandwiched between the
appropriate light-cone Wilson lines) in the double-logarithmic approximation
(DLA: summing powers of $\alpha_s\,\ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong
coupling constant). In this work, we observe that an important mixing of the
above operators with another gluon operator, $\overleftarrow{D}^i\,{D}^i$, also
sandwiched between the light-cone Wilson lines (with the repeated index $i=1,2$
summed over), was missing in the previous works. This operator has the physical
meaning of the sub-eikonal (covariant) phase: its contribution to helicity
evolution is shown to be proportional to another sub-eikonal operator,
$D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, which is related to the Jaffe-Manohar polarized
gluon distribution. In this work we include this operator into small-$x$
helicity evolution, and construct a novel evolution mixing all three operators
($D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, $F^{12}$, and ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$),
generalizing the previous results. We also construct closed DLA evolution
equations in the large-$N_c$ and large-$N_c\& N_f$ limits, with $N_c$ and $N_f$
the numbers of quark colors and flavors, respectively. Solving the large-$N_c$
equations numerically we obtain the following small-$x$ asymptotics of the
quark and gluon helicity distributions $\Delta \Sigma$ and $\Delta G$, along
with the $g_1$ structure function, \[\Delta\Sigma(x,Q^2)\sim\Delta G(x,Q^2)\sim
g_1(x,Q^2)\sim\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{3.66\,\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s\,N_c}{2\pi}}},\]

generalize these ideas to arbitrary variational wave functions and we focus, as
illustration, on the particular case of restricted Boltzmann machines. The
imaginary time evolution is carried out using stochastic reconfiguration
(natural gradient descent), combined with Monte Carlo sampling. Since the time
evolution takes place on the tangent space, deviations between the actual path
in the Hilbert space and the trajectory on the variational manifold can be
important, depending on the internal structure and expressivity of the
variational states. We show how these differences translate into a rescaled
temperature and demonstrate the application of the method to quantum spin
systems in one and two spatial dimensions.

interacting with a funnel potential under dc driving as the skyrmion density

average skyrmion velocity due to jamming of skyrmions near the funnel opening,
while the Magnus force causes skyrmions to accumulate on one side of the funnel
array. For driving in the hard direction, there is a critical skyrmion density
below which the skyrmions become trapped. Above this critical value, a clogging

can rearrange into different clogged configurations, while at higher drives,
the velocity-force curves become continuous. When skyrmions pile up near the

other skyrmions is blocked by the repulsive skyrmion-skyrmion interactions. We
observe a strong diode effect in which the critical depinning force is higher

of Magnus force to dissipative term is varied, the skyrmion velocity varies in
a non-linear and non-monotonic way due to the pile up of skyrmions on one side

driving is diminished.

more than ever it has found many application areas for many challenging
optimization problems. It is, however, a known fact that PSO has a severe
drawback in the update of its global best (gbest) particle, which has a crucial
role of guiding the rest of the swarm. In this paper, we propose three
efficient solutions to remedy this problem using the SPSA Algorithm. In the
first approach, gbest is updated with respect to a global estimation of the
gradient and can avoid getting trapped into a local optimum. The second
approach is based on the formation of an alternative or artificial global best
particle, the so-called aGB, which can replace the native gbest particle for a
better guidance, the decision of which is held by a fair competition between
the two. The third approach is based on the update of the swarm particle. For
this purpose we use simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA)
for its low cost. Since SPSA is applied only to the gbest (not to the entire
swarm) or to the entire swarm, both approaches result thus in a negligible
overhead cost for the entire PSO process. Both approaches are shown to
significantly improve the performance of PSO over a wide range of non-linear
functions, especially if SPSA and PSO parameters are well selected to fit the
problem at hand. As in the basic PSO application, experimental results show
that the proposed approaches significantly improved the quality of the

public and private sector applications and often requires handling delayed
feedback, small data, and distribution shifts. We demonstrate its importance on
real data from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS
performs yearly audits of the tax base. Two of its most important objectives
are to identify suspected misreporting and to estimate the ""tax gap"" -- the
global difference between the amount paid and true amount owed. Based on a
unique collaboration with the IRS, we cast these two processes as a unified

consequences given that the current tax gap is estimated at nearly half a

task for computer-aided orthodontic treatments. Existing learning-based methods
rely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we
are the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance
segmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each
dental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we
present a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely
DArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and
tooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help
locate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch
proposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection.
Specifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental
arch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve
regression, and then a graph-based convolutional network (GCN) is trained to
refine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware
Point Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation.
Meantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training
strategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the
tooth centroid. Experimental results on $4,773$ dental models have shown our
DArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance
is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

that both emit non-thermal emission in the radio regime, with the clearest
evidence for NGC7635. Our results are less conclusive for BD+433654, as the
emission from its bow shock becomes weaker and fainter at higher radio
frequencies. Our results extend the previous radio results for the BD+433654
bow shock to higher frequencies. Modelling of our data for both sources shows
that accelerated electrons at the wind termination shock are a plausible source
for the non-thermal radio emission, but energetics arguments suggest that any
non-thermal X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission could be significantly below
existing upper limits. Enhanced synchrotron emission from compressed Galactic
cosmic rays in the radiative bow shock could also explain the radio emission
from the BD+433654 bow shock but not NGC7635. Non-detection of point-like radio
emission from BD+433654 puts an upper limit on the mass-loss rate of the star

dynamic generation of trace links that are far more accurate than was
previously possible. However, DL-generated links lack clear explanations, and
therefore non-experts in the domain can find it difficult to understand the
underlying semantics of the link, making it hard for them to evaluate the
link's correctness or suitability for a specific software engineering task. In
this paper we present a novel NLP pipeline for generating and visualizing trace
link explanations. Our approach identifies domain-specific concepts, retrieves
a corpus of concept-related sentences, mines concept definitions and usage
examples, and identifies relations between cross-artifact concepts in order to
explain the links. It applies a post-processing step to prioritize the most
likely acronyms and definitions and to eliminate non-relevant ones. We evaluate
our approach using project artifacts from three different domains of
interstellar telescopes, positive train control, and electronic health-care
systems, and then report coverage, correctness, and potential utility of the
generated definitions. We design and utilize an explanation interface which
leverages concept definitions and relations to visualize and explain trace link
rationales, and we report results from a user study that was conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of the explanation interface. Results show that the
explanations presented in the interface helped non-experts to understand the
underlying semantics of a trace link and improved their ability to vet the
correctness of the link.

of ferroelectric materials can provide a path that is less vulnerable to
mechanical failures and thus complements and expands current tuning systems. In
this work, we present and design a novel concept for using the ferroelectric
Potassium Tantalate ($KTaO_3$ or KTO) material as a tuning element in
haloscopes based on coupled microwave cavities. In this line, the structures
used in the Relic Axion Detector Exploratory Setup (RADES) group are based on
several cavities that are connected by metallic irises, which act as
interresonator coupling elements. In this article, we also show how to use
these $KTaO_3$ films as interresonator couplings between cavities, instead of
inductive or capacitive metallic windows used in the past. These two concepts
represent a crucial upgrade over the current systems employed in the dark
matter axions community, achieving a tuning range of $2.23 \, \%$ which
represents a major improvement as compared to previous works ($<0.1 \, \%$) for

traffic at intermediate nodes represents a defining characteristic for
classification. In this context, the transition from the first generation of
optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) mode to the second generation of
optical-bypass marked a paradigm shift in redesigning optical transport
networks towards greater network efficiency. Optical-bypass operation has then
become the \textit{de facto} approach adopted by the majority of carriers in
both metro and backbone networks in the last two decades and has remained
basically unchanged. However, in optical-bypass network, the fact that
in-transit lightpaths crossing a common intermediate node must be separated in
either time, frequency or spatial domain to avoid adversarial interference
appears to be a critical shortcoming as the interaction of such lightpaths in
optical domain may result in efficient computing and/or signal processing
operations for saving spectral resources. Inspired by the accelerated
progresses in optical signal processing technologies and the integration of
computing and communications, we introduce in this paper a new architectural
paradigm for future optical networks and highlight how this new architecture
has the potential to shatter the \textit{status quo}. Indeed, our proposal is
centered on exploiting the superposition of in-transit lightpaths at
intermediate nodes to generate more spectrally efficient lightpaths and how to
harness this opportunity from network design perspectives. We present two case
studies featuring optical aggregation and optical XOR encoding to demonstrate
the merit of optical-processing-enabled operation compared to its counterpart,
optical-bypass. Numerical results on realistic network typologies are provided,
revealing that a spectral saving up to $30\%$ could be achieved thanks to
adopting optical-processing network.

solve the corresponding McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential

which the mean-field interaction only depends on expectation or other moments
and thus inadequate to solve problems when the mean-field interaction has full

  In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for computing
MV-FBSDEs with a general form of mean-field interactions. Specifically, built
on fictitious play, we recast the problem into repeatedly solving standard
FBSDEs with explicit coefficient functions. These coefficient functions are
used to approximate the MV-FBSDEs' model coefficients with full distribution
dependence, and are updated by solving another supervising learning problem
using training data simulated from the last iteration's FBSDE solutions. We use
deep neural networks to solve standard BSDEs and approximate coefficient
functions in order to solve high-dimensional MV-FBSDEs. Under proper
assumptions on the learned functions, we prove that the convergence of the
proposed method is free of the curse of dimensionality (CoD) by using a class
of integral probability metrics previously developed in [Han, Hu and Long,

octahedral distortions were found to strongly depend on the ionic radii of the
rare-earth element. First-principles calculations based on density-functional
theory within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew- Burke-

some insights into the electronic characteristics of the series of RCrO3
compounds. The calculated values of lattice parameters and band gaps with
Hubbard U correction (SCAN+U) agree well with values measured experimentally

  Let $z_L(G)$ be the smallest number of lazy zombies (zombies that can stay

The enhanced input is generated by a multichannel adaptive noise cancellation

its filter taps. The time-frequency mask is applied to the noisy input to
produce enhanced output features for ASR. Detailed evaluations are presented
with simulated and re-recorded datasets in speech-based and non-speech-based

large-scale state-of-the-art ASR model. It also will be shown to significantly

model is agnostic of the number of microphones and array configuration and,
therefore, can be used with different microphone arrays without the need for

As opposed to using a fixed squeeze factor, we sample it uniformly during

trade-off between word error rate (WER) and inference time with only marginal
WER degradation compared to the W2V2 and SEW models trained for a specific

A key contribution of our work is a novel solver for efficiently recovering
approximate solutions to discrete-continuous inference problems. The key
insight to our approach is that while joint inference over continuous and
discrete state spaces is often hard, many commonly encountered
discrete-continuous problems can naturally be split into a ""discrete part"" and
a ""continuous part"" that can individually be solved easily. Leveraging this
structure, we optimize discrete and continuous variables in an alternating
fashion. In consequence, our proposed work enables straightforward
representation of and approximate inference in discrete-continuous graphical

both discrete and continuous variables. We demonstrate the versatility of our
approach through its application to distinct robot perception applications,

dynamics. Two of the v-gutter's geometrical parameters are varied: the
v-gutter's base angle ($\theta$) and the size of a slit ($\xi$) at the
leading-edge of the v-gutter. Turbulent flow kinematics and pressure field are
analyzed to evaluate the unsteadiness at a freestream Mach number of $M_\infty

length (L) of $Re_L=0.1 \times 10^6$. Five v-gutter angles are considered
($\theta$, $^\circ = \pi/6, \pi/4, \pi/3, 5\pi/12, \pi/2$) and three slit sizes
($\xi$, mm =0,0.25,0.5) are considered only for a particular $\theta =
[\pi/6]$. In general, high fluctuations in velocity and pressure are seen for
the bluffest body in consideration ($\theta = \pi/2$) with higher drag ($c_d$)
and total pressure loss ($\Delta p_0$). On the other hand, the presence of a
slit on a streamlined body ($\theta = \pi/6$) tends to efficiently stabilize
the wake and thus, producing almost a periodic shedding structure with lower
$c_d$ and $\Delta p_0$. For $\theta = [\pi/6]$, broadened spectra in vortex
shedding is seen with a peak at $[fL/u_\infty] \sim 0.08$. For $\theta \geq
[\pi/4]$, a dominant discrete shedding frequency is seen with a gradual
spectral decay. Similarly, the effects of $\xi$ on the $\theta = [\pi/6]$ case
produce a discrete shedding frequency instead of a broadened one, as told
before. The shedding frequency increases to a maximum of $[fL/u_\infty] \sim
0.26$ for the maximum slit size of $\xi = 0.5$. More insights on the shedding
vortices, momentum deficit in the wake, varying energy contents in the flow

require domain expertise to create, and necessitate mathematical insight for

coil turns induced by the electromagnetic forces can cause quenches limiting
the magnet performance. For this reason, an azimuthal preload is applied to
avoid azimuthal movements of the coil up to the required operational current.
However, several tests showed that accelerator magnets can operate with a
partial preload, i.e. that coil unloading during the ramp does not prevent
reaching higher currents. This issue is particularly relevant for Nb3Sn
magnets, where the loads applied to the Nb3Sn filaments can reach the
degradation limits of critical current. In order to investigate the impact of
coil preload on the quench performance, the MQXFS6 short model quadrupole for
the High Luminosity Upgrade was tested under an azimuthal preload at 80% of the
short sample current, reaching 93% of short sample current at 1.9 K. The
preload was then released to 60%, still showing ability to operate in the range
of 80-85% of short sample current as required by HL-LHC project. With this
lower preload, the ability of going above 90% of short sample was lost, and a
significant training appeared above 85%. When the preload was restored to the
original 80% value, the magnet reached with few quenches 95% of short sample

further context to studies of their co-evolution, an investigation is carried
out to gain insight as to whether quasars and their hosts at earlier epochs
follow the local relation between black hole (BH) mass and stellar velocity
dispersion. We use 584 SDSS quasars at 0.2 < z < 0.8 with black hole
measurements, and properties of their hosts from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program. An inference of the stellar velocity dispersion is achieved
for each based on the stellar mass and size of the host galaxy by using the
galaxy mass fundamental plane for inactive galaxies at similar redshifts. In
agreement with past studies, quasars occupy an elevated position from the local
M_BH-sigma relation, considered as a flattening, while maintaining ratios of
M_BH/M* consistent with local values. Based on a forward-modeling of the
sample, we demonstrate that an evolving intrinsic M_BH-sigma relation can match
the observations. However, we hypothesize that these changes may be a
reflection of a non-evolving intrinsic relationship between M_BH and M*.
Reassuringly, there are signs of migration onto the local M_BH-sigma for
galaxies that are either massive, quiescent or compact. Thus, the majority of
the bulges of quasar hosts at high redshift are in a development stage and
likely to align with their black holes onto the mass scaling relation at later
times.

malicious attacks, the audit mechanism has been widely deployed in various
practical fields. In order to examine security vulnerabilities and prevent the
leakage of sensitive data in a timely manner, the database logging system
usually employs an online signaling scheme to issue an alert when suspicious
access is detected. Defenders can audit alerts to reduce potential damage. This
interaction process between a defender and an attacker can be modeled as an
audit game. In previous studies, it was found that sending real-time signals in
the audit game to warn visitors can improve the benefits of the defender.
However, the previous approaches usually assume perfect information of the
attacker, or simply concentrate on the utility of the defender. In this paper,
we introduce a brand-new zero-determinant (ZD) strategy to study the sequential
audit game with online signaling, which empowers the defender to unilaterally
control the utility of visitors when accessing sensitive data. In addition, an
optimization scheme based on the ZD strategy is designed to effectively
maximize the utility difference between the defender and the attacker.
Extensive simulation results show that our proposed scheme enhances the
security management and control capabilities of the defender to better handle
different access requests and safeguard the system security in a cost-efficient
manner.

  In an $n$-node network ($n$ is unknown), our first algorithm, which is {\em

be known to all but $o(1)$ fraction of the good nodes. This algorithm works for
\emph{any} bounded degree expander network. However, this algorithms assumes
that good nodes can send arbitrarily large-sized messages in a round.
  Our second algorithm is {\em randomized} and most good nodes send only
small-sized messages (Throughout this paper, a small-sized message is defined
to be one that contains $O(\log{n})$ bits in addition to at most a constant
number of node IDs.). This algorithm works in \emph{almost all} $d$-regular

$B(n)$ are unknown to the algorithm) arbitrarily (adversarially) placed
Byzantine nodes, where $\xi$ is any arbitrarily small (but fixed) positive
constant. This algorithm takes $O(B(n)\log^2{n})$ rounds and outputs a (fixed)
constant factor estimate of $\log{n}$ with probability at least $1 - o(1)$. The
said estimate is known to most nodes, i.e., $\geq (1 - \beta)n$ nodes for any
arbitrarily small (but fixed) positive constant $\beta$.

of the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham (KS) states as analytical functions of
the external potential, $\Delta v$, and of the interaction strength, $U$. We
use this unique circumstance to establish a rigorous comparison between the
individual contributions to the correlation energies stemming from the two
theories in the $\{U,\Delta v\}$ parameter space. Within this analysis of the
Hubbard dimer, we observe a change in the sign of the HF kinetic correlation
energy, compare the indirect repulsion energies, and derive an expression for
the 'traditional' correlation energy, i.e. the one that corrects the HF
estimate, in a pure site-occupation function theory spirit [Eq. (43)]. Next, we
test the performances of the Liu-Burke and the Seidl-Perdew-Levy functionals,
which model the correlation energy based on its weak- and strong-interaction
limit expansions and can be used for both the traditional and the KS
correlation energies. Our results show that, in the Hubbard dimer setting, they
typically work better for the HF reference, despite having been originally
devised for KS. These conclusions are somewhat in line with prior assessments
of these functionals on various chemical data sets. However, the Hubbard dimer
model allows us to show the extent of the error that may occur in using the
strong-interaction ingredient for the KS reference in place of the one for the
HF reference, as has been carried out in most of the prior assessments.

success, from natural language processing to learning the languages of
biological sequences and organic molecules. These models have demonstrated
superior performance in the generation, structure classification, and
functional predictions for proteins and molecules with learned representations.
However, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed
for generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to
interpret their design logic. Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a
neural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and
tinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank
filling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique
advantages in learning the ""materials grammars"" together with high-quality
generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically
valid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\% charge neutrality and
84.8\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher
compared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation
process of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned
materials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the
TCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to
discover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations. Our work
thus brings the unsupervised transformer language models based generative
artificial intelligence to inorganic materials. A user-friendly web app has
been developed for computational materials doping and can be accessed freely at

methods for viruses as well as biomarkers and environmental hormones. For
example, testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential in the fight against the COVID-19
pandemic. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the
current standard for COVID-19 testing; however, it is hampered by the long
testing process. Shortening the testing process while achieving high
sensitivity would facilitate sooner quarantine and thus presumably prevention
of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we aim to achieve rapid, sensitive detection
of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by enhancing the performance of optical
biosensing with a dual-comb configuration of optical frequency combs. The
virus-concentration-dependent optical spectrum shift is transformed into a
photonic RF shift by frequency conversion between the optical and RF regions,
facilitating mature electrical frequency measurements. Furthermore,
active-dummy temperature-drift compensation enables very small changes in the
virus-concentration-dependent signal to be extracted from the large, variable
background signal. This dual-comb biosensing technique has the potential to
reduce the COVID-19 testing time to 10 min while maintaining sensitivity close
to that of RT-PCR. Furthermore, this system can be applied for sensing of not
only viruses but also various biomolecules for clinical diagnosis, health care,
and environmental monitoring.

joint embedding that fully supports the ``optionality"" that this
complementarity brings. Our embedding supports optionality on two axes: (i)
optionality across modalities -- use any combination of modalities as query for
downstream tasks like retrieval, (ii) optionality across tasks --
simultaneously utilising the embedding for either discriminative (e.g.,
retrieval) or generative tasks (e.g., captioning). This provides flexibility to
end-users by exploiting the best of each modality, therefore serving the very
purpose behind our proposal of a trilogy in the first place. First, a
combination of information-bottleneck and conditional invertible neural
networks disentangle the modality-specific component from modality-agnostic in
sketch, photo, and text. Second, the modality-agnostic instances from sketch,
photo, and text are synergised using a modified cross-attention. Once learned,
we show our embedding can accommodate a multi-facet of scene-related tasks,

Quantum programming is different from classical programming, for example, the
state of a quantum program is probabilistic in nature, and a quantum computer
is error-prone due to the instability of quantum mechanisms. Therefore, the
characteristics of bugs in quantum software projects may be very different from
that of classical software projects. This work aims to understand the
characteristics of bugs in quantum software projects, in order to provide
insights to help devise effective testing and debugging mechanisms. To achieve
this goal, we conduct an empirical study on the bug reports of 125 quantum
software projects. We observe that quantum software projects are more buggy
than classical software projects and that quantum project bugs are more costly
to fix than classical project bugs. We also identify the types of the bugs and
the quantum programming components where they occurred. Our study shows that
the bugs are spread across different components, but quantum-specific bugs
particularly appear in the compiler, gate operation, and state preparation
components. The three most occurring types of bugs are Program anomaly bugs,
Configuration bugs, and Data type and structure bugs. Our study highlights some
particularly challenging areas in quantum software development, such as the
lack of scientific quantum computation libraries that implement comprehensive
mathematical functions for quantum computing. Quantum developers also seek
specialized data manipulation libraries for quantum software engineering like
Numpy for quantum computing. Our findings also provide insights for future work
to advance the quantum program development, testing, and debugging of quantum
software, such as providing tooling support for debugging low-level circuits.

they are easier to satisfy. We argue that - before deployment - system
designers should: estimate the shifts a recommender would induce; evaluate
whether such shifts would be undesirable; and perhaps even actively optimize to
avoid problematic shifts. These steps involve two challenging ingredients:
estimation requires anticipating how hypothetical algorithms would influence
user preferences if deployed - we do this by using historical user interaction
data to train a predictive user model which implicitly contains their
preference dynamics; evaluation and optimization additionally require metrics
to assess whether such influences are manipulative or otherwise unwanted - we
use the notion of ""safe shifts"", that define a trust region within which
behavior is safe: for instance, the natural way in which users would shift
without interference from the system could be deemed ""safe"". In simulated
experiments, we show that our learned preference dynamics model is effective in
estimating user preferences and how they would respond to new recommenders.
Additionally, we show that recommenders that optimize for staying in the trust
region can avoid manipulative behaviors while still generating engagement.

from loss of vision on time scales of years despite therapy, whereas the
prediction of the visual acuity (VA) and the earliest possible detection of
deterioration under real-life conditions is challenging due to heterogeneous
and incomplete data. In this contribution, we present a workflow for the
development of a research-compatible data corpus fusing different IT systems of
the department of ophthalmology of a German maximum care hospital. The
extensive data corpus allows predictive statements of the expected progression
of a patient and his or her VA in each of the three diseases. We found out for
the disease AMD a significant deterioration of the visual acuity over time.
Within our proposed multistage system, we classify the VA progression into the
three groups of therapy ""winners"", ""stabilizers"", and ""losers"" (WSL scheme).
Our OCT biomarker classification using an ensemble of deep neural networks
results in a classification accuracy (F1-score) of over 98 %, enabling us to
complete incomplete OCT documentations while allowing us to exploit them for a
more precise VA modelling process. Our VA prediction requires at least four VA
examinations and optionally OCT biomarkers from the same time period to predict
the VA progression within a forecasted time frame, whereas our prediction is
currently restricted to IVOM / no therapy. While achieving a prediction
accuracy of up to 69 % (macro average F1-score) when considering all three

it is more time-efficient and cost-effective to do so during the design phase

relies on logic synthesis, logic simulation, gate-level power estimation, and
gate leakage assessment to compute a ranking. The ranking metric can be defined

mini-Neptune in a 7.7 day period orbit. HIP 94235 is part of the AB Doradus
moving group, one of the youngest and closest associations. Due to its youth,
the host star exhibits significant photometric spot modulation, lithium
absorption, and X-ray emission. Three 0.06% transits were observed during
Sector-27 of the TESS Extended Mission, though these transit signals are
dwarfed by the 2% peak-to-peak photometric variability exhibited by the host
star. Follow-up observations with CHEOPS confirmed the transit signal and
prevented the erosion of the transit ephemeris. HIP 94235 is part of a 50 AU
G-M binary system. We make use of diffraction limited observations spanning 11
years, and astrometric accelerations from Hipparchos and Gaia, to constrain the
orbit of HIP 94235 B. HIP 94235 is one of the tightest stellar binaries to host
an inner planet. As part of a growing sample of bright, young planet systems,
HIP 94235 b is ideal for follow-up transit observations, such as those that

approximating training on infinite data, test errors tend to be close to the
ground truth decision boundary. Qualitatively speaking these are also more
difficult for a human. By contrast, adversarial examples can be found almost
everywhere and are often obvious mistakes. However, when we constrain
adversarial examples to the manifold, we observe a 90\% reduction in
adversarial errors. If we inflate the manifold by training with Gaussian noise
we observe a similar effect. In both cases, the remaining adversarial errors
tend to be close to the ground truth decision boundary. Qualitatively, the
remaining adversarial errors are similar to test errors on difficult examples.

offline VRPs, which consider a given set of trip requests to be served, and
online VRPs, which consider requests as they arrive in real-time. Based on
discussions with public transit agencies, we identify a real-world problem that
is not addressed by existing formulations: booking trips with flexible pickup
windows (e.g., 3 hours) in advance (e.g., the day before) and confirming tight
pickup windows (e.g., 30 minutes) at the time of booking. Such a service model
is often required in paratransit service settings, where passengers typically
book trips for the next day over the phone. To address this gap between offline
and online problems, we introduce a novel formulation, the offline vehicle
routing problem with online bookings. This problem is very challenging
computationally since it faces the complexity of considering large sets of
requests -- similar to offline VRPs -- but must abide by strict constraints on
running time -- similar to online VRPs. To solve this problem, we propose a
novel computational approach, which combines an anytime algorithm with a
learning-based policy for real-time decisions. Based on a paratransit dataset
obtained from the public transit agency of Chattanooga, TN, we demonstrate that
our novel formulation and computational approach lead to significantly better

a few Tesla. Here, we characterize the QL of ZrTe$_5$ at fields up to 64 T by a
combination of electrical-transport and ultrasound measurements. We find that
the Zeeman effect in ZrTe$_5$ enables an efficient tuning of the 1D Landau band
structure with magnetic field. This results in a Lifshitz transition to a 1D
Weyl regime in which perfect charge neutrality can be achieved. Since no
instability-driven phase transitions destabilise the 1D electron liquid for the
investigated field strengths and temperatures, our analysis establishes
ZrTe$_5$ as a thoroughly understood platform for potentially inducing more
exotic interaction-driven phases at lower temperatures.

images is able to detect genetic variations and tumor environment, but few
studies focus on differential gene expression in tumor cells. In this paper, we
propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, HistCode, to infer
differential gene expressions from whole slide images (WSIs). We leveraged
contrastive learning on large-scale unannotated WSIs to derive slide-level
histopathological feature in latent space, and then transfer it to tumor
diagnosis and prediction of differentially expressed cancer driver genes. Our
extensive experiments showed that our method outperformed other
state-of-the-art models in tumor diagnosis tasks, and also effectively
predicted differential gene expressions. Interestingly, we found the higher
fold-changed genes can be more precisely predicted. To intuitively illustrate
the ability to extract informative features from pathological images, we
spatially visualized the WSIs colored by the attentive scores of image tiles.
We found that the tumor and necrosis areas were highly consistent with the
annotations of experienced pathologists. Moreover, the spatial heatmap
generated by lymphocyte-specific gene expression patterns was also consistent
with the manually labeled WSI.

of the black hole in M87. It is proposed that, instead of being a torus of
accreting gas, the observed annular ring is a rotating, magnetically-dominated
ergomagnetosphere that can transmit electromagnetic angular momentum and energy
outward to the disc through a combination of large scale magnetic torque and
small scale instabilities. It is further proposed that energy can be extracted
by magnetic flux threading the ergosphere through the efficient emission of
long wavelength electromagnetic disturbances onto negative energy orbits, when
the invariant $B^2-E^2$ becomes negative. In this way, the spinning black hole
and its ergosphere not only power the jets but also the ejection disc so as to
drive away most of the gas supplied near the Bondi radius. This outflow takes
the form of a MHD wind, extending over many decades of radius, with a
unidirectional magnetic field, that is collimated by the infalling gas across a
magnetopause. This wind, in turn, collimates the relativistic jets and the
emission observed from the jet sheath may be associated with a return current.
A model for the global flow of mass, angular momentum, energy and current, on
scales from the horizon to the Bondi radius, is presented and discussed.

range. Here, we examine the dynamics in polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) using a
combination of simulations and experiments and quantitatively separate the role
of polymer packing from other effects on the dynamics, as a function of
distance from the nanoparticle surfaces. After showing good qualitative
agreement between the simulations and experiments in glassy structure and creep
compliance, we use a recently developed machine learning technique to decompose
polymer dynamics in our simulated PNCs into structure-dependent and
structure-independent processes. With this decomposition, the free energy
barrier for polymer rearrangement can be described as a combination of
packing-dependent and packing-independent barriers. We find both barriers are
higher near nanoparticles and decrease with applied stress, quantitatively
demonstrating that the slow interfacial dynamics is not solely due to polymer
packing differences, but also the change of structure-dynamics relationships.
Finally, we present how this decomposition can be used to accurately predict
strain-time creep curves for PNCs from their static configuration, providing
additional insights into the effects of polymer-nanoparticle interfaces on

optics and refractive optics. Diffractive optics is characterized by a
perturbative expansion of the Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integral, while
refractive optics is characterized by the stationary phase approximation.
Previously, it has been assumed that the Fresnel scale, $R_F$ , is the relevant
physical scale that separates these two regimes. With the recent introduction
of Picard-Lefschetz theory to the field of lensing, it has become possible to
generalize the refractive description of discrete images to all wave
parameters, and, in particular, exactly evaluate the diffraction integral at
all frequencies. In this work, we assess the regimes of validity of refractive
and diffractive approximations for a simple one-dimensional lens model through
comparison with this exact evaluation. We find that, contrary to previous
assumptions, the true separation scale between these regimes is given by $R_F /
\sqrt{\kappa}$, where $\kappa$ is the convergence of the lens. Thus, when the
lens is strong, refractive optics can hold for arbitrarily small scales. We
also argue that intensity variations in diffractive optics are generically
small, which has implications for the study of strong diffractive scintillation
(DISS).

introduced to search for the optimal training samples on the fly. Further, to
exploit local latent-space dynamics captured by the local DI models for an
improved modeling accuracy with a minimum number of local DI models in the

The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various

  of Large DNNs","17 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  DNN models across many domains continue to grow in size, resulting in high
resource requirements for effective training, and unpalatable (and often
unaffordable) costs for organizations and research labs across scales. This
paper aims to significantly reduce training costs with effective use of
preemptible instances, i.e., those that can be obtained at a much cheaper price
while idle, but may be preempted whenever requested by priority users. Doing
so, however, requires new forms of resiliency and efficiency to cope with the
possibility of frequent preemptions - a failure model that is drastically
different from the occasional failures in normal cluster settings that existing
checkpointing techniques target.
  We present Bamboo, a distributed system that tackles these challenges by
introducing redundant computations into the training pipeline, i.e., whereby
one node performs computations over not only its own layers but also over some
layers in its neighbor. Our key insight is that training large models often
requires pipeline parallelism where ""pipeline bubbles"" naturally exist. Bamboo
carefully fills redundant computations into these bubbles, providing resilience
at a low cost. Across a variety of widely used DNN models, Bamboo outperforms
traditional checkpointing by 3.7x in training throughput, and reduces costs by
2.4x compared to a setting where on-demand instances are used.

iteration complexity bound, oracle complexity bound, and local convergence
under a H\""olderian growth condition. The local convergence results include
local quadratic convergence under the quadratic growth condition; this is the
first to extend the classical result for least-squares problems to a general
smooth composite function. In addition, this is the first LM method with both
an oracle complexity bound and local quadratic convergence under standard

that using PAoI as the information freshness metric in designing sleep-wake

hidden-space representations of samples in each class, REPRINT extrapolates, in

spanned by principal components to summarize distribution structure of both

Besides, this method involves a label refinement component which allows to
synthesize new soft labels for augmented examples. Compared with different NLP

through comprehensive ablation studies, we show that label refinement is better

an algorithm which forms a tabular Markov Decision Process (MDP) over the

learned dynamics models to plan short trajectories between states. Since exact
value iteration can be performed on this constructed MDP, it becomes easy to
identify which trajectories are advantageous to add to the MDP. Crucially,
since most transitions in this MDP come from the logged data, trajectories from
the MDP can be rolled out for long periods with confidence. We prove that this
property allows one to make upper and lower bounds on the value function up to
appropriate distance metrics. Finally, we demonstrate empirically how
algorithms that uniformly constrain the learned policy to the entire dataset
can result in unwanted behavior, and we show an example in which simply
behavior cloning the optimal policy of the MDP created by our algorithm avoids

the corresponding spectra with QPO and non-QPO are analyzed. We find that the
spectra with QPO (hereafter QPO spectra) are softer than those without QPO
(hereafter non-QPO spectra) in the hard intermediate state (HIMS). While in the
soft intermediate state (SIMS), the QPO spectra are slightly harder. The disk
temperature of QPO regime is slightly lower during HIMS, but becomes higher

significant differences. The flux ratio of the disk to total flux is higher for

over-confidence issue, which degrades the performance and calibration. Inspired
by label smoothing and driven by the ambiguity of boundary annotation in NER
engineering, we propose boundary smoothing as a regularization technique for
span-based neural NER models. It re-assigns entity probabilities from annotated
spans to the surrounding ones. Built on a simple but strong baseline, our model
achieves results better than or competitive with previous state-of-the-art
systems on eight well-known NER benchmarks. Further empirical analysis suggests
that boundary smoothing effectively mitigates over-confidence, improves model
calibration, and brings flatter neural minima and more smoothed loss
landscapes.

be fair players in the Ultimatum Game, the whole population unexpectedly
evolves into the full fairness level. The basic observations are quite robust
in homogeneous networks, but the converging time as a function of the pinning

heterogeneous networks, this leverage effect is even more pronounced that one

be applied to further save the control cost. Intermittent failures are seen
when the pinning control is marginally strong, our statistical analysis

that has gained increasing attention in recent years, which aims to predict the
future facts by using relevant historical facts on the temporal knowledge
graphs. There are two main difficulties in this prediction task. First, from
the historical facts point of view, how to model the evolutionary patterns of
the facts to predict the query accurately. Second, from the query perspective,
how to handle the two cases where the query contains seen and unseen entities
in a unified framework. Driven by the two problems, we propose a novel adaptive
pseudo-siamese policy network for temporal knowledge prediction based on
reinforcement learning. Specifically, we design the policy network in our model
as a pseudo-siamese policy network that consists of two sub-policy networks. In
sub-policy network I, the agent searches for the answer for the query along the
entity-relation paths to capture the static evolutionary patterns. And in
sub-policy network II, the agent searches for the answer for the query along
the relation-time paths to deal with unseen entities. Moreover, we develop a
temporal relation encoder to capture the temporal evolutionary patterns.
Finally, we design a gating mechanism to adaptively integrate the results of
the two sub-policy networks to help the agent focus on the destination answer.
To assess our model performance, we conduct link prediction on four benchmark

considerable performance compared with existing methods.

learns to predict \texttt{[null]} and real words jointly given the surrounding
context. In the inference stage, the model readily detects whether a word
should be inserted or deleted with the standard masked language modeling
function. We further create an evaluation dataset to foster research on word

of HESS J1858+020 can be smoothly connected by a power-law function, with an
index of $\sim$2.2. The connected spectrum is well explained with a hadronic
emission, with the cutoff energy of protons above 1 PeV. It thus indicates that
there is a potential PeVatron in the HII region and should be further verified
with ultra-high energy observations with, e.g., LHAASO.

nucleus of the Milky Way discovered in ~1-100 GeV data collected by the Large
Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. Previous work has
revealed substructure within the Fermi Bubbles that has been interpreted as a
signature of collimated outflows from the Galaxy's super-massive black hole.
Here we show via a spatial template analysis that much of the gamma-ray
emission associated to the brightest region of substructure -- the so-called
cocoon -- is likely due to the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy.
This large Milky Way satellite is viewed through the Fermi Bubbles from the
position of the Solar System. As a tidally and ram-pressure stripped remnant,
the Sgr dSph has no on-going star formation, but we nevertheless demonstrate
that the dwarf's millisecond pulsar (MSP) population can plausibly supply the
gamma-ray signal that our analysis associates to its stellar template. The
measured spectrum is naturally explained by inverse Compton scattering of
cosmic microwave background photons by high-energy electron-positron pairs
injected by MSPs belonging to the Sgr dSph, combined with these objects'
magnetospheric emission. This finding plausibly suggests that MSPs produce
significant gamma-ray emission amongst old stellar populations, potentially
confounding indirect dark matter searches in regions such as the Galactic
Centre, the Andromeda galaxy, and other massive Milky Way dwarf spheroidals.

therefore, this is a direct test of systematic uncertainties on estimation of

al. (2021; arXiv:2105.08299) provide a large and uniformly measured sample of
IR SBF distances which we directly compare with distances to 25 SNIa host
galaxies. We divide the Hubble flow SNIa into sub-samples that best match the
divergent supernova properties seen in the IR SBF hosts and Cepheid hosts. We
further divide the SNIa into a sample with light curve widths and host masses
that are congruent to those found in the SBF-calibrated hosts. We refit the
light curve stretch and color correlations with luminosity, and use these
revised parameters to calibrate the Hubble flow supernovae with IR SBF
calibrators. Relative to the Hubble flow, the average calibrator distance
moduli vary by 0.03mag depending on the SNIa subsamples examined and this adds
a 1.8% systematic uncertainty to our Hubble constant estimate. Based on the IR
SBF calibrators, Ho=74.6$\pm$0.9(stat)$\pm$ 2.7(syst) km/s/Mpc, which is
consistent with the Hubble constant derived from supernovae calibrated from

pandemic-induced restrictions on travel and social gathering. Contrary to
in-person conferences, virtual conferences face the challenge of efficiently
scheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants from
different timezones and their interests in attending different talks. A natural
objective for conference organizers is to maximize efficiency, e.g., total
expected audience participation across all talks. However, we show that
optimizing for efficiency alone can result in an unfair virtual conference
schedule, where individual utilities for participants and speakers can be
highly unequal. To address this, we formally define fairness notions for
participants and speakers, and derive suitable objectives to account for them.
As the efficiency and fairness objectives can be in conflict with each other,
we propose a joint optimization framework that allows conference organizers to
design schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) among efficiency,
participant fairness and speaker fairness objectives. While the optimization
problem can be solved using integer programming to schedule smaller
conferences, we provide two scalable techniques to cater to bigger conferences.
Extensive evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the efficacy and
flexibility of our proposed approaches.

components: user and item embedding learning, followed by the user-item
interaction modeling. By utilizing the auxiliary review information accompanied
with user ratings, many of the existing review-based recommendation models
enriched user/item embedding learning ability with historical reviews or better
modeled user-item interactions with the help of available user-item target
reviews. Though significant progress has been made, we argue that current
solutions for review-based recommendation suffer from two drawbacks. First, as
review-based recommendation can be naturally formed as a user-item bipartite
graph with edge features from corresponding user-item reviews, how to better
exploit this unique graph structure for recommendation? Second, while most
current models suffer from limited user behaviors, can we exploit the unique
self-supervised signals in the review-aware graph to guide two recommendation
components better? To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Review-aware
Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCL) framework for review-based recommendation.
Specifically, we first construct a review-aware user-item graph with
feature-enhanced edges from reviews, where each edge feature is composed of
both the user-item rating and the corresponding review semantics. This graph
with feature-enhanced edges can help attentively learn each neighbor node
weight for user and item representation learning. After that, we design two
additional contrastive learning tasks (i.e., Node Discrimination and Edge
Discrimination) to provide self-supervised signals for the two components in
recommendation process. Finally, extensive experiments over five benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RGCL compared to the
state-of-the-art baselines.

limited bandwidth) further limit the performance of CI. To overcome these

a sense of body ownership and thus an immersive experience. However, breaking
this consistency can enable new interaction functionalities, such as pseudo
haptic feedback or input augmentation, at the expense of immersion. We propose
to quantify the probability of users noticing the movement inconsistency while
the inconsistency amplitude is being enlarged, which aims to guide the
intervention of the users' sense of body ownership in VR. We applied angular
offsets to the avatar's shoulder and elbow joints and recorded whether the user
identified the inconsistency through a series of three user studies and built a
statistical model based on the results. Results show that the noticeability of
movement inconsistency increases roughly quadratically with the enlargement of
offsets and the offsets at two joints negatively affect the probability
distributions of each other. Leveraging the model, we implemented a technique
that amplifies the user's arm movements with unnoticeable offsets and then
evaluated implementations with different parameters(offset strength, offset
distribution). Results show that the technique with medium-level and
balanced-distributed offsets achieves the best overall performance. Finally, we
demonstrated our model's extendability in interventions in the sense of body
ownership with three VR applications including stroke rehabilitation, action

should construct optimal teaching datasets assuming the teacher knows
everything about the student. However, in the real world, the teacher doesn't
have complete information about the student. The teacher must interact and
diagnose the student, before teaching. Our work proposes a simple diagnosis
algorithm which uses Gaussian processes for inferring student-related
information, before constructing a teaching dataset. We apply this to two
settings. One is where the student learns from scratch and the teacher must
figure out the student's learning algorithm parameters, eg. the regularization
parameters in ridge regression or support vector machines. Two is where the
student has partially explored the environment and the teacher must figure out
the important areas the student has not explored; we study this in the offline
reinforcement learning setting where the teacher must provide demonstrations to
the student and avoid sending redundant trajectories. Our experiments highlight
the importance of diagosing before teaching and demonstrate how students can
learn more efficiently with the help of an interactive teacher. We conclude by
outlining where diagnosing combined with teaching would be more desirable than
passive learning.

Considering the complexity of ultrasound images, we develop an adaptive

module, which mainly consists of a channel self-attention block and a spatial
self-attention block, to replace the traditional convolution operation.
Compared with the conventional convolution operation, the design of the hybrid
adaptive attention module can help us capture more features under different
receptive fields. Different from existing attention mechanisms, the hybrid
adaptive attention module can guide the network to adaptively select more
robust representation in channel and space dimensions to cope with more complex
breast lesions segmentation. Extensive experiments with several

holographic quantum uncertainties in an emergent background space-time. Despite
increasing promise for the target detection regime of Planckian strain spectral
density, the latest motivating theoretical ideas have not been connected to a
phenomenological model of observables measured in a realistic experiment. This
manuscript proposes a candidate model, based on the central hypothesis that all
horizons are universal boundaries of coherent quantum information -- where the
decoherence of space-time happens for the observer. The prediction is motivated
by 't Hooft's algebra for black hole information that gives coherent states on
horizons, whose spatial correlations were shown by Verlinde and Zurek to also
appear on holographic fluctuations of causal boundaries in flat space-time
(conformal Killing horizons). Time-domain correlations are modeled from
Planckian jitters whose coherence scales match causal diamonds, motivated by
Banks' framework for the emergence of space-time and locality. The universality
of this coherence on causal horizons compels a multimodal research program
probing concordant signatures: An analysis of cosmological data to probe
primordial correlations, motivated by Hogan's interpretation of well-known CMB
anomalies as coherent fluctuations on the inflationary horizon, and upcoming 3D
interferometers to probe causal diamonds in flat space-time. Candidate

volume) through a single-shot coded image (a 2-D measurement). We designed an
imaging model that synchronously applies aperture coding and pixel-wise
exposure coding within a single exposure time. This coding scheme enables us to
effectively embed the original information into a single observed image. The
observed image is then fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN) for
light-field reconstruction, which is jointly trained with the camera-side
coding patterns. We also developed a hardware prototype to capture a real 3-D
scene moving over time. We succeeded in acquiring a dynamic light field with
5x5 viewpoints over 4 temporal sub-frames (100 views in total) from a single
observed image. Repeating capture and reconstruction processes over time, we
can acquire a dynamic light field at 4x the frame rate of the camera. To our
knowledge, our method is the first to achieve a finer temporal resolution than
the camera itself in compressive light-field acquisition. Our software is

Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme, and show that

reconstruction and three-dimensional (3D) localization of targets based on
multiple two-dimensional (2D) observations of the same scene. The resolving
along the elevation direction can be treated as a line spectrum estimation
problem. However, traditional super-resolution spectrum estimation algorithms
require multiple snapshots and uncorrelated targets. Meanwhile, as the most
popular TomoSAR imaging method in modern years, compressed sensing (CS) based
methods suffer from the gridding mismatch effect which markedly degrades the
imaging performance. As a gridless CS approach, atomic norm minimization can
avoid the gridding effect but requires enormous computing resources. Addressing
the above issues, this paper proposes an improved fast ANM algorithm to TomoSAR
elevation focusing by introducing the IVDST-ANM algorithm, which reduces the
huge computational complexity of the conventional time-consuming semi-positive
definite programming (SDP) by the iterative Vandermonde decomposition and
shrinkage-thresholding (IVDST) approach, and retains the benefits of ANM in
terms of gridless imaging and single snapshot recovery. We conducted
experiments using simulated data to evaluate the performance of the proposed

in nearby disc galaxies. These were originally detected as a displacement of
the interstellar medium about the midplane, either in terms of vertical
distance or vertical velocity. Over the past decade, similar patterns have
emerged in the Milky Way's stellar disc. We investigate how these vertical
waves are triggered by a passing satellite. Using high-resolution
N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, we systematically study how the corrugations
set up and evolve jointly in the stellar and gaseous discs. We find that the
gas corrugations follow the stellar corrugations, i.e. they are initially in
phase although, after a few rotation periods (500-700 Myr), the distinct waves
separate and thereafter evolve in different ways. The spatial and kinematic
amplitudes (and thus the energy) of the corrugations dampen with time, with the
gaseous corrugation settling at a faster rate (~800 Myr versus ~1 Gyr). In
contrast, the vertical energy of individual disc stars is fairly constant
throughout the galaxy's evolution. This difference arises because corrugations
are an emergent phenomenon supported by the collective, ordered motions of
co-spatial ensembles of stars. We show that the damping of the stellar
corrugations can be understood as a consequence of incomplete phase mixing,
while the damping of the gaseous corrugations is a natural consequence of the
dissipative nature of the gas. We suggest that - in the absence of further,
strong perturbations - the degree of correlation between the stellar and
gaseous waves may help to age-date the phenomenon.

matter with the running vacuum. The vacuum energy density varies as the squares
of the Hubble parameter ($\rho_{\Lambda}\propto H^2$), and the coefficient of
bulk viscosity of matter is proportional to the velocity of expansion ($\xi
\propto H$). We obtained an analytical solution to the Friedmann equations and
estimated the model parameters using the combined data set SN1a+CMB+BAO+OHD. We
have evaluated the universe's age as 14 Gyr, which is slightly higher than the
age-predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, it is an improved result
compared to the age-predicted by a class of bulk viscous matter-dominated
models. Interestingly, we have obtained the coefficient of bulk viscosity of
the matter component as $1.316\times 10^5$ kg $\textnormal m^{-1}$ $\textnormal
s^{-1}$ which is one to two orders of magnitude less than the value predicted
by most of the bulk viscous matter-dominated models and it falls in the range
of highly viscous materials found on the earth. The Hubble parameter is a
decreasing function of the scale factor, and it attains a constant value in the
far future that corresponds to an end deSitter phase of evolution. The
deceleration parameter shows a transition from matter-dominated decelerated
phase to vacuum energy-dominated accelerating phase, and the transition
redshift is obtained as $z_T = 0.73$. The statefinder analysis distinguishes
our model from the $\Lambda$CDM model at present, and the $r-s$ trajectory
reveals the quintessence behaviour of the vacuum energy. The phase space
analysis shows that the universe is evolving towards a mechanically stable
state in the far future. The entropy evolution satisfies the generalised second
law of thermodynamics, and the entropy is maximised in the far future
evolution.

image in real-world applications. On many modern cameras, dual-pixel (DP)
sensors create two-image views, based on which stereo information can be
exploited to benefit defocus deblurring. Despite the impressive results
achieved by existing DP defocus deblurring methods, the misalignment between DP
image views is still not studied, leaving room for improving DP defocus
deblurring. In this work, we propose a Dual-Pixel Alignment Network (DPANet)
for defocus deblurring. Generally, DPANet is an encoder-decoder with
skip-connections, where two branches with shared parameters in the encoder are
employed to extract and align deep features from left and right views, and one
decoder is adopted to fuse aligned features for predicting the sharp image. Due
to that DP views suffer from different blur amounts, it is not trivial to align
left and right views. To this end, we propose novel encoder alignment module
(EAM) and decoder alignment module (DAM). In particular, a correlation layer is
suggested in EAM to measure the disparity between DP views, whose deep features
can then be accordingly aligned using deformable convolutions. DAM can further
enhance the alignment of skip-connected features from encoder and deep features
in decoder. By introducing several EAMs and DAMs, DP views in DPANet can be
well aligned for better predicting latent sharp image. Experimental results on
real-world datasets show that our DPANet is notably superior to
state-of-the-art deblurring methods in reducing defocus blur while recovering
visually plausible sharp structures and textures.

map-based visual-inertial localization. First, we propose a new Lie group with
its algebra, based on which a novel invariant extended Kalman filter (invariant
EKF) is designed. We theoretically prove that, when we do not consider the
uncertainty of the map information, the proposed invariant EKF can naturally
maintain the correct observability properties of the system. To consider the
uncertainty of the map information, we introduce a Schmidt filter. With the
Schmidt filter, the uncertainty of the map information can be taken into
consideration to avoid over-confident estimation while the computation cost
only increases linearly with the size of the map keyframes. In addition, we
introduce an easily implemented observability-constrained technique because
directly combining the invariant EKF with the Schmidt filter cannot maintain
the correct observability properties of the system that considers the
uncertainty of the map information. Finally, we validate our proposed system's
high consistency, accuracy, and efficiency via extensive simulations and
real-world experiments.

instance indicated by a natural language expression. There are typically two
kinds of existing methods: one-stage methods that directly perform segmentation
on the fused vision and language features; and two-stage methods that first
utilize an instance segmentation model for instance proposal and then select
one of these instances via matching them with language features. In this work,
we propose a novel framework that simultaneously detects the target-of-interest
via feature propagation and generates a fine-grained segmentation mask. In our
framework, each instance is represented by an Instance-Specific Feature (ISF),
and the target-of-referring is identified by exchanging information among all
ISFs using our proposed Feature Propagation Module (FPM). Our instance-aware
approach learns the relationship among all objects, which helps to better
locate the target-of-interest than one-stage methods. Comparing to two-stage
methods, our approach collaboratively and interactively utilizes both vision
and language information for synchronous identification and segmentation. In
the experimental tests, our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art

However, clustering methods have not been explored extensively for speaker

agglomerative hierarchical clustering only take into account properties such as
proximity and relative densities. In this paper we propose to view
clustering-based diarization as a community detection problem. By doing so the
topological structure is considered. This work has four major contributions.
First it is shown that Leiden community detection algorithm significantly
outperforms the previous methods on the clustering of speaker-segments. Second,
we propose to use uniform manifold approximation to reduce dimension while
retaining global and local topological structure. Third, a masked filtering
approach is introduced to extract ""clean"" speaker embeddings. Finally, the
community structure is applied to an end-to-end post-processing network to
obtain diarization results. The final system presents a relative DER reduction

special nodes with specific information and frozen bit patterns. To further
improve the parallelism of SC decoding, this paper present a new class of
special nodes composed of a sequence of rate one or single-parity-check

$\mu_0H_{\rm m}\approx 35$~T for the applied magnetic fields along the
crystallographic $b$ axis in the orthorhombic structure. The resultanting
volume magnetostriction of $\Delta V/V \approx-5.9\times 10^{-4}$ gives the
initial pressure dependence of $H_{\rm m}$ by employing the
Clausius-Clapeyron's equation, which agrees with previous pressure experiments.
Further, significant anisotropic magnetostriction (AMS), derived by subtracting
the averaged linear magnetostriction, was revealed. Contrary to the weakly
field-dependent AMS along the $a$ axis, those along the $b$ and $c$ axes show
strong field dependences with a similar magnitude but with opposite signs,
indicating its lattice instability. The relationship between characteristic

shrinkage in UTe$_2$ at $H_{\rm m}$, contrary to the volume expansion in

scenarios. Due to the diversity of human languages, texts with the same label
in different domains may differ greatly, which brings challenges to the
multi-domain text classification. Current advanced methods use the
private-shared paradigm, capturing domain-shared features by a shared encoder,
and training a private encoder for each domain to extract domain-specific
features. However, in realistic scenarios, these methods suffer from
inefficiency as new domains are constantly emerging. In this paper, we propose
a robust contrastive alignment method to align text classification features of
various domains in the same feature space by supervised contrastive learning.
By this means, we only need two universal feature extractors to achieve
multi-domain text classification. Extensive experimental results show that our

explore further the issue of cartilage boundary lubrication, which has been
attributed to phospholipid (PL)-exposing layers at the cartilage surface in
part. A surface force balance (SFB) with unique sensitivity is used to
investigate the normal and frictional interactions of the boundary layers
formed by PLs extracted from osteoarthritic (OA) human synovial fluid (hSF).
Our results reveal that vesicles of the OA-hSF lipids rupture spontaneously to
form bilayers on the mica substrate (which, like the in-vivo articular
cartilage surface in synovial joints, is negatively-charged) which then undergo
hemifusion at quite low pressures in the SFB, attributed to the large
heterogeneity of the hSF lipids. Nanometric friction measurements reveal
friction coefficients mu = ca. 0.03 across the hemi-fused bilayer of these
lipids, indicating residual hydration lubrication at the lipid-headgroup vs.
substrate interface. Addition of calcium ions causes an increase in friction to
mu = ca. 0.2, attributed either to calcium-bridging attraction of lipid
headgroups to the negatively-charged substrate, or a shift of the slip plane to
the more dissipative hydrophobic-tail vs. hydrophobic-tail interface. Our
results suggest that the heterogeneity and composition of the OA-hSF lipids may
be associated with higher friction at the cartilage boundary layers, and thus a
connection with greater wear and degradation, due to hemifusion of the exposed
lipid bilayers.

paired blurry-sharp training data is unavailable. Conventional Maximum A
Posteriori estimation and deep learning-based deblurring methods are restricted

propose a Neural Maximum A Posteriori (NeurMAP) estimation framework for
training neural networks to recover blind motion information and sharp content
from unpaired data. The proposed NeruMAP consists of a motion estimation
network and a deblurring network which are trained jointly to model the
(re)blurring process (i.e. likelihood function). Meanwhile, the motion
estimation network is trained to explore the motion information in images by
applying implicit dynamic motion prior, and in return enforces the deblurring
network training (i.e. providing sharp image prior). The proposed NeurMAP is an
orthogonal approach to existing deblurring neural networks, and is the first
framework that enables training image deblurring networks on unpaired datasets.
Experiments demonstrate our superiority on both quantitative metrics and visual
quality over state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available on

to study the spatial distribution of its members as function of metallicity
with little selection effects. Our study compares the spatial distributions of
a metal-poor population of 9719 stars with [Fe/H] $< -1.3$ and a metal rich one

Neumann boundary conditions and anti-collocated boundary input and output. The
desired reference tracking is solved using the well-known flatness and Lyapunov
approaches. The reference profile is obtained by solving the motion planning
problem for the nominal plant. To robustify the closed-loop system in the
presence of the disturbances and uncertainties, it is then augmented with PI
feedback plus a discontinuous component responsible for rejecting matched
disturbances with \textit{a priori} known magnitude bounds. Such control law
only requires the information of the system at the same boundary as the control
input is located. The resulting dynamic controller globally exponentially
stabilizes the error dynamics while also attenuating the influence of
Lipschitz-in-time external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. For the
case when the motion planning is performed over the uncertain plant, an
exponential Input-to-State Stability is obtained, preserving the boundedness of
the tracking error norm. The proposed controller relies on a discontinuous term
that however passes through an integrator, thereby minimizing the chattering
effect in the plant dynamics. The performance of the closed-loop system, thus
designed, is illustrated in simulations under different kinds of reference
trajectories in the presence of external disturbances and parameter
uncertainties.

composed of competing short- and long-range interactions, are investigated on a
$\pi$-flux lattice by using the mean-field theory and determinant quantum Monte
Carlo (DQMC) simulations. Both methods identify a plaquette-dimer phase, which
develops from a finite interaction strength. While its signature in DQMC is
relatively weak, a obvious antiferromagnetic transition is revealed in the spin
structure factor instead. The corresponding critical interaction and exponents
are readily obtained by finite-size scalings, with the plaquette-dimer
structure factor that can also be well scaled. These results suggest a possible
deconfined quantum critical point between the plaquette-dimer and
antiferromagnetic phases driven by the cluster-charge interaction on a

build meaningful operation call sequences, researchers have proposed techniques
to learn and utilize the API dependencies based on OpenAPI specifications.
However, these techniques either lack the overall awareness of how all the APIs
are connected or the flexibility of adaptively fixing the learned knowledge. In
this paper, we propose Morest, a model-based RESTful API testing technique that
builds and maintains a dynamically updating RESTful-service Property Graph

ClothFormer involves three major modules. First, a two-stage anti-occlusion

utilizes ridge regression and optical flow correction to smooth the dense flow

attacker. While allowing targets to have different values, classic settings
often assume uniform requirements to defend the targets. This enables existing
results that study mixed strategies (randomized allocation algorithms) to adopt
a compact representation of the mixed strategies.
  In this work, we initiate the study of mixed strategies for the security
games in which the targets can have different defending requirements. In
contrast to the case of uniform defending requirement, for which an optimal
mixed strategy can be computed efficiently, we show that computing the optimal
mixed strategy is NP-hard for the general defending requirements setting.
However, we show that strong upper and lower bounds for the optimal mixed

close-to-optimal Patching algorithm that computes mixed strategies that use

variation, which dynamically adapts to the emergence of patterns in the
population. However, GP-GOMEA lacks a mechanism to optimize coefficients. In
this paper, we study how fairly simple approaches for optimizing coefficients
can be integrated into GP-GOMEA. In particular, we considered two variants of
Gaussian coefficient mutation. We performed experiments using different
settings on 23 benchmark problems, and used machine learning to estimate what
aspects of coefficient mutation matter most. We find that the most important
aspect is that the number of coefficient mutation attempts needs to be
commensurate with the number of mixing operations that GP-GOMEA performs. We
applied GP-GOMEA with the best-performing coefficient mutation approach to the
data sets of SRBench, a large SR benchmark, for which a ground-truth underlying
equation is known. We find that coefficient mutation can help re-discovering
the underlying equation by a substantial amount, but only when no noise is
added to the target variable. In the presence of noise, GP-GOMEA with
coefficient mutation discovers alternative but similarly-accurate equations.

this end, we propose a model-driven method for constructing hyper-reduced order

Multi-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM) to formulate the equations of motion in

Subsequently, a Galerkin projection reduces the order of the model.
Nonetheless, the necessary fine discretization of the interfaces represents a
bottleneck for achieving high speedups. For this reason, we implement an

encounter a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost when deciding on
the mesh size, whose estimation is particularly challenging for problems of
this type. To assess the accuracy of our method without resorting to the HF

can be computed from the change in the grand potential (or free energy) in

Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer mean-field theory emphasizing its origin as a
variational approximation for the grand potential. The variational parameters
are the effective fields that enter in the mean-field Hamiltonian, namely the
Hartree-Fock potential and the pairing potential. The superfluid weight is
usually computed by ignoring the dependence of the effective fields on the
twisted boundary conditions. However, it has been pointed out in recent works
that this can lead to unphysical results, particularly in the case of lattice

dependence of the effective fields on the twisted boundary conditions leads in
fact to the generalized random phase approximation. Our second result is
providing the mean-field grand potential as an explicit function of the
one-particle density matrix. This allows us to derive the expression for the
superfluid weight within the generalized random phase approximation in a
transparent manner. Moreover, reformulating mean-field theory as a well-posed
minimization problem in terms of the one-particle density matrix is a first

in the near- to far-infrared waveband, mainly due to the zodiacal light
foreground. Instead, gamma-ray astronomy offers the possibility to indirectly
set limits on the EBL by studying the effects of gamma-ray absorption in the
very high energy (VHE:$>$100 GeV) spectra of distant blazars. The High Altitude
Water Cherenkov gamma ray observatory (HAWC) is one of the few instruments
sensitive to gamma rays with energies above 10 TeV. This offers the opportunity
to probe the EBL in the near/mid IR region: $\lambda$ = 1 $\mu$m - 100 $\mu$m.
In this study, we fit physically motivated emission models to Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT) GeV data to extrapolate the intrinsic TeV spectra of blazars.
We then simulate a large number of absorbed spectra for different randomly
generated EBL model shapes and calculate Bayesian credible bands in the EBL
intensity space by comparing and testing the agreement between the absorbed
spectra and HAWC extragalactic observations of two blazars. The resulting bands
are in agreement with current EBL lower and upper limits, showing a downward

previous measurements.

direct numerical simulations (with up to 1.8 billions cells) of the
compressible turbulent flow around a supercritical airfoil, at Reynolds and
Mach numbers of $Re_\infty= 3 \times 10^5$ and $M_\infty =0.7$. Control via
spanwise forcing is applied over a fraction of the suction side of the airfoil.
Besides locally reducing friction, the control modifies the shock wave and
significantly improves the aerodynamic efficiency of the airfoil by increasing
lift and decreasing drag. Hence, the airfoil can achieve the required lift at a
lower angle of attack and with a lower drag. Estimates at the aircraft level
indicate that substantial savings are possible; when control is active, its
energy cost becomes negligible thanks to the small application area. We suggest
that skin-friction drag reduction should be considered not only as a goal, but
also as a tool to improve the global aerodynamics of complex flows.

Besides, we maintain only the keyframe poses in the map and employ Schmidt
extended Kalman filter to update the state partially, so that the uncertainty
of the map information can be consistently considered with low computational
cost. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that the ever-changing
linearization points of the estimated state can introduce spurious information
to the augmented system and make the original four-dimensional unobservable
subspace vanish, leading to inconsistent estimation in practice. To relieve
this problem, we employ first-estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to maintain the correct
observability properties of the augmented system. Furthermore, we introduce an
observability-constrained updating method to compensate for the significant
accumulated error after the long-term absence (can be 3 minutes and 1 km) of

proposed algorithm is validated. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate

in detecting delay times. In this article, we will show in detail not only the
relationship between delay times and Goos-Haenchen shifts, but also the close
connection between the impulse change in quantum mechanics and angular
deviations in optics. Lateral shifts are caused by the phase of Fresnel
coefficients whereas angular deviations by the breaking of symmetry of the wave
number distributions. The classical formula for the delay time is based on the
use of the stationary phase method and contains a divergence for incidence at a
critical potential energy. For Gaussian beams, the mean value calculation
removes such a divergence. The closed expression for the delay time for
incidence at critical energy show an excellent agreement with the numerical
calculation. The three-dimensional analysis of delay times allow to find the
final and definitive connection between wave packets reflected by a potential

Binary Cross-Entropy and pairwise Bayesian Personalized Ranking, are not

optimized on the loss would inherit the data biases, or even worse, amplify the
biases. For example, a few popular items take up more and more exposure
opportunities, severely hurting the recommendation quality on niche items --
known as the notorious Mathew effect. In this work, we develop a new learning
paradigm named Cross Pairwise Ranking (CPR) that achieves unbiased
recommendation without knowing the exposure mechanism. Distinct from inverse
propensity scoring (IPS), we change the loss term of a sample -- we
innovatively sample multiple observed interactions once and form the loss as
the combination of their predictions. We prove in theory that this way offsets
the influence of user/item propensity on the learning, removing the influence
of data biases caused by the exposure mechanism. Advantageous to IPS, our
proposed CPR ensures unbiased learning for each training instance without the

is one of the most fundamental theories of physics and has been shown to be in
excellent agreement with experimental results. Specifically, measurements of
the electronic magnetic moment (or $g$ factor) of highly charged ions (HCI) in
Penning traps can provide a stringent probe for QED, testing the Standard model
in the strongest electromagnetic fields. When studying the difference of
isotopes, even the intricate effects stemming from the nucleus can be resolved
and tested as, due to the identical electron configuration, many common QED
contributions do not have to be considered. Experimentally however, this
becomes quickly limited, particularly by the precision of the ion masses or the
achievable magnetic field stability. Here we report on a novel measurement
technique that overcomes both of these limitations by co-trapping two HCIs in a
Penning trap and measuring the difference of their $g$ factors directly. The
resulting correlation of magnetic field fluctuations leads to drastically
higher precision. We use a dual Ramsey-type measurement scheme with the ions
locked on a common magnetron orbit, separated by only a few hundred
micrometres, to extract the coherent spin precession frequency difference. We
have measured the isotopic shift of the bound electron $g$ factor of the neon
isotopes of $^{20}$Ne$^{9+}$ and $^{22}$Ne$^{9+}$ to 0.56 parts-per-trillion
($5.6 \cdot 10^{-13}$) precision relative to their $g$ factors, which is an
improvement of more than two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art
techniques. This resolves the QED contribution to the nuclear recoil for the
very first time and accurately validates the corresponding theory. Furthermore,
the agreement with theory allows setting constraints for a fifth-force,
resulting from Higgs-portal-type dark-matter interactions.

important topic for disease diagnosis. Although the convolutional neural
network (CNN) has been proven to have excellent performance in image
segmentation tasks, it is difficult to obtain global information. The lack of
global information will seriously affect the accuracy of the segmentation
results of the lesion area. In addition, there are visual representation
differences between multimodal data of the same patient. These differences will
affect the results of the automatic segmentation methods. To solve these
problems, we propose a segmentation method suitable for multimodal medical
images that can capture global information, named TranSiam. TranSiam is a 2D
dual path network that extracts features of different modalities. In each path,
we utilize convolution to extract detailed information in low level stage, and
design a ICMT block to extract global information in high level stage. ICMT
block embeds convolution in the transformer, which can extract global
information while retaining spatial and detailed information. Furthermore, we
design a novel fusion mechanism based on cross attention and selfattention,
called TMM block, which can effectively fuse features between different
modalities. On the BraTS 2019 and BraTS 2020 multimodal datasets, we have a
significant improvement in accuracy over other popular methods.

generalization capacity of these models within the framework of kernel theory.
We introduce and study the effective kernel rank, a figure of merit that
quantifies the number of independent features a noisy quantum kernel is able to

driven-dissipative quantum spins to perform a classification task, where the
input data are encoded into the driving fields and the quantum physical system

progressively and autonomously develop pixel-wise representations in a video

paired with a contrastive term, leads to an unsupervised learning criterion
that naturally copes with the considered setting. Differently from most
existing works, the learned representations are used in open-set

physical properties of widely observed complex systems in nature. In many
cases, pattern formation processes are measured on the basis of spatially
coarse-grained features of the smallest elements, that is, the pixel space of a
grayscale image. By binarizing the data using a common threshold, one can
analyze such grayscale image data using geometrical features, such as the
number of domains (Betti number) or domain size. Because such topological
features are indicators for evaluating all regions uniformly, it is difficult
to determine the nature of each region in a nonuniform structure. Moreover,
binarization leads to loss of valuable information such as fluctuations in the
domain. Here, we show that the analysis method based on persistent homology
provides effective knowledge to understand such pattern formation processes.
Specifically, we analyze the pattern formation process in ferromagnetic
materials under a rapidly sweeping external magnetic field and discover not
only existing types of pattern formation dynamics but also novel ones. On the
basis of results of topological data analysis, we also found a candidate
reduction model to describe the mechanics of these novel magnetic domain
formations. The analysis procedure with persistent homology presented in this

influence of user experience on the user satisfaction rating of TDS as opposed

conversational recommendation dataset. Unlike prior work, we annotate the
sampled dialogues at both the turn and dialogue level on six dialogue aspects:
relevance, interestingness, understanding, task completion, efficiency, and
interest arousal. The annotations allow us to study how different dialogue
aspects influence user satisfaction. We introduce a comprehensive set of user

influence users' overall impression. We find that the concept of satisfaction

offered the state-of-the-art performance. However, two key challenges have not
been well explored in existing solutions: i) The over-smoothing effect with

Such computation however, is still orders of magnitude slower than direct

FHE schemes can work natively either at bit-level using Boolean circuits, or
over integers using modular arithmetic. Operations on integers are limited to
addition/subtraction and multiplication. On the other hand, bit-level
arithmetic is much more comprehensive allowing more operations, such as
comparison and division. While modular arithmetic can emulate bit-level

attack method against MLP-Mixer called Maxwell's demon Attack (MA). MA breaks
the channel-mixing and token-mixing mechanism of MLP-Mixer by controlling the
part input of MLP-Mixer's each Mixer layer, and disturbs MLP-Mixer to obtain
the main information of images. Our method can mask the part input of the Mixer
layer, avoid overfitting of the adversarial examples to the source model, and
improve the transferability of cross-architecture. Extensive experimental
evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the
proposed MA. Our method can be easily combined with existing methods and can
improve the transferability by up to 38.0% on MLP-based ResMLP. Adversarial
examples produced by our method on MLP-Mixer are able to exceed the
transferability of adversarial examples produced using DenseNet against CNNs.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to study adversarial
transferability of MLP-Mixer.

random flows with different characteristic time scales and amplitudes. Methods:
We conducted a series of 3D MHD simulations of random driving imposed on a
gravitationally stratified model of the solar atmosphere. In order to
understand differences between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC)
heating, we considered the effects of changing the characteristic time scales
of the imposed velocities. We also investigated the effects of the magnitude of
the velocity driving. Results: Complex foot point motions lead to a
proliferation of current sheets and energy dissipation throughout the corona.
For a given amplitude, DC driving typically leads to a greater rate of energy
injection when compared to AC driving. This leads to the formation of larger
currents, increased heating rates and higher temperatures in DC simulations.
There is no difference in the spatial distribution of energy dissipation across
simulations, however, energy release events in AC cases tend to be more
frequent and last for less time. Higher velocity driving is associated with
larger currents, higher temperatures and the corona occupying a larger fraction
of the simulation volume. In all cases, most of heating is associated with
small energy release events, which occur much more frequently than large
events. Conclusions: When combined with observational results showing a greater
abundance of power in low frequency modes, these findings suggest that energy
release in the corona is likely to be driven by long time scale motions. In the
corona, AC and DC driving will occur concurrently and their effects remain
difficult to isolate. The distribution of field line temperatures and the
asymmetry of temperature profiles may reveal the frequency and longevity of
energy release events and therefore the relative importance of AC and DC
heating.

variability of magnetic fields on the surface of lower main-sequence stars.
However, determining the lifetime of active region growth and decay as well as
their evolution is a complex task. We aim to test whether the lifetime for
active region evolution shows any dependency on the stellar parameters. We
identify a sample of stars with well-defined ages via their kinematics. We made
use of high-resolution spectra to compute rotational velocities, activity
levels, and emission excesses. We use these data to revisit the
activity-rotation-age relationship. The time-series of the main optical
activity indicators were analysed together with the available photometry by
using Gaussian processes to model the stellar activity of these stars.
Autocorrelation functions of the available photometry were also analysed. We
use the derived lifetimes for active region evolution to search for
correlations with the stellar age, the spectral type, and the level of
activity. We also use the pooled variance technique to characterise the
activity behaviour of our targets. Our analysis confirms the decline of
activity and rotation as the star ages. We also confirm that the rotation rate
decays with age more slowly for cooler stars and that, for a given age, cooler
stars show higher levels of activity. We show that F- and G-type young stars
also depart from the inactive stars in the flux-flux relationship. The gaussian
process analysis of the different activity indicators does not seem to provide
any useful information on active region's lifetime and evolution. On the other
hand, active region's lifetimes derived from the light-curve analysis might
correlate with the stellar age and temperature. Although we caution the small
number statistics, our results suggest that active regions seem to live longer
on younger, cooler, and more active stars.

the materials studied and obtain good agreement with experimental coercive

Potential flow around a cylinder then solves the Navier--Stokes equations using
friction parameter $\beta=-2\nu$. This negative friction parameter can be
interpreted physically as the fluid being accelerated by the cylinder wall.
This explains the lack of drag.
  In this paper, we introduce the Navier slip boundary condition and show that
choosing the friction parameter positive resolves d'Alembert's paradox. We then
further examine the effect of the friction parameter $\beta$ on the drag

interpreted, using molecular dynamics simulations, as arising from charge

around transient voids having an average lifetime of 300 fs. Although voids
were also present in CCl4, they were not characterized by hydrogen bond defects

exhibit different properties that are complementary to one another. It has

Fisher-KPP type, in which the diffusion is given by an integral operator. The
level sets will organize themselves into an invasion front that is
asymptotically linear in time, corrected by a logarithmic term.
  For a special class of nonlinearities, this fact can be deduced from the
study of an underlying branching random walk (A\""idekon, 2013). This extends a
famous result by Bramson (1983), where the diffusion is given by the Laplacian,

  Motivated by models arising from epidemiology and ecology, that go beyond the

logarithmic correction can be derived by working directly on the

performance on various audio tasks. These representations are pre-trained by
self-supervised learning methods that create training signals from the input.
For example, typical audio contrastive learning uses temporal relationships
among input sounds to create training signals, whereas some methods use a
difference among input views created by data augmentations. However, these
training signals do not provide information derived from the intact input
sound, which we think is suboptimal for learning representation that describes
the input as it is.
  In this paper, we seek to learn audio representations from the input itself
as supervision using a pretext task of auto-encoding of masked spectrogram
patches, Masked Spectrogram Modeling (MSM, a variant of Masked Image Modeling
applied to audio spectrogram). To implement MSM, we use Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), an image self-supervised learning method. MAE learns to efficiently
encode the small number of visible patches into latent representations to carry
essential information for reconstructing a large number of masked patches.
While training, MAE minimizes the reconstruction error, which uses the input as
training signal, consequently achieving our goal.
  We conducted experiments on our MSM using MAE (MSM-MAE) models under the
evaluation benchmark of the HEAR 2021 NeurIPS Challenge. Our MSM-MAE models
outperformed the HEAR 2021 Challenge results on seven out of 15 tasks (e.g.,
accuracies of 73.4% on CREMA-D and 85.8% on LibriCount), while showing top
performance on other tasks where specialized models perform better. We also
investigate how the design choices of MSM-MAE impact the performance and
conduct qualitative analysis of visualization outcomes to gain an understanding

a number of important and unique advantages it offers, most notably the
unprecedented durability and density. While the technology is evolving rapidly,
the prohibitive cost of reads and writes, the high frequency and the peculiar
nature of errors occurring in DNA storage pose a significant challenge to its
adoption. In this work we make a novel observation that the probability of
successful recovery of a given bit from any type of a DNA-based storage system
highly depends on its physical location within the DNA molecule. In other
words, when used as a storage medium, some parts of DNA molecules appear
significantly more reliable than others. We show that large differences in
reliability between different parts of DNA molecules lead to highly inefficient
use of error-correction resources, and that commonly used techniques such as
unequal error-correction cannot be used to bridge the reliability gap between
different locations in the context of DNA storage. We then propose two
approaches to address the problem. The first approach is general and applies to
any types of data; it stripes the data and ECC codewords across DNA molecules
in a particular fashion such that the effects of errors are spread out evenly
across different codewords and molecules, effectively de-biasing the underlying
storage medium. The second approach is application-specific, and seeks to
leverage the underlying reliability bias by using application-aware mapping of
data onto DNA molecules such that data that requires higher reliability is
stored in more reliable locations, whereas data that needs lower reliability is
stored in less reliable parts of DNA molecules. We show that the proposed data
mapping can be used to achieve graceful degradation in the presence of high
error rates, or to implement the concept of approximate storage in DNA.

lunar surface. This wealth of data presents a unique opportunity to study the
meteoroid flux of the Earth-Moon environment, and in recent years the physical
properties of the impactors. However, other than through serendipitous events,
there has not been yet a systematic search and discovery of the craters
associated to these events. Such a meteoroid-crater link would allow us to get
insight into the crater formation via these live observations of collisions.
Here we present the PyNAPLE (Python NAC Automated Pair Lunar Evaluator)
software pipeline for locating newly formed craters using the location and
epoch of an observed impact flash. We present the first results from PyNAPLE,
having been implemented on the 2017-09-27 impact flash.
  A rudimentary analysis on the impact flash and linked impact crater is also
performed, finding that the crater's ejecta pattern indicates an impact angle
between 10-30 degree, and although the rim-to-rim diameter of the crater is not
resolvable in current LRO NAC images, using crater scaling laws we predict this
diameter to be 24.1-55.3 m, and using ejecta scaling predict a diameter of
27.3-37.7 m. We discuss how PyNAPLE will enable large scale analyses of
sub-kilometer scale cratering rates and refinement of both scaling laws, and
the luminous efficiency.

recent years by developing large deep models. Despite the outstanding
performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted
the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required
to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M
structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning
approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint.
However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and
performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network.
To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration
accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio
for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on
super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method

DNA sequences (contigs). Given the complexity of microbial communities, single
contig microbial genomes are rarely obtained. Instead, contigs are eventually
clustered into bins, with each bin ideally making up a full genome. This

  Current state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning rely only on the
local features for the individual contigs. These techniques therefore fail to

  A study of four online hackathons","Accepted in Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction
  (CSCW'22)",,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hackathons and similar time-bounded events have become a popular form of
collaboration. They are commonly organized as in-person events during which
teams engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a
project that is of interest to them. Most research to date has focused on
studying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the
advantages of radical co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has
led to many hackathons moving online, which challenges our current
understanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by
presenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that
participated in 4 hackathons across two continents. By analyzing the collected
data, we found that teams merged synchronous and asynchronous means of
communication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as well as to
maintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based
on individual skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different
strategies (e.g., participant experience, the responsibility of registering the
team in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons, such as the
radical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams
that kept synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio
territories), in a sort of ""radical virtual co-location"". However, others, such
as interactions with other teams, easy access to mentors, and networking with
other participants, decreased. In addition, the technical constraints of the
different communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and were
overwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual
collaboration of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how
technologies and event structures proposed by organizers imply this
collaboration.

relation, i.e. $r_{\rm msph} \propto B^{4/7}$, but also find that the
dependence on the accretion rate is very weak. Furthermore, we find that the
material torque correlates linearly with the mass-accretion rate, although both
of them exhibit rapid fluctuations. Interestingly, the total torque fluctuates
drastically in strong magnetic field simulations and these unsteady torques
observed in the simulations could be associated with the spin fluctuations

Previously performed theoretical studies have predicted the phase instability
of SnS in this crystal structure at ambient condition. But, after a detailed
study performing on the phonon calculation of SnS, we have predicted the phase
stability of SnS with considering the Sn 4$p$ orbitals as valence states in
$ab-initio$ calculation. The importance of long range Coulomb forces along with
the themodynamical properties are also described in detailed for both
materials. The preliminary evidence of topological phonon is found along X-W
direction, where the linear band touching is observed as compared to type II
Weyl phononic material ZnSe. The topological phase transition is seen for these
materials due to EPI, where non-linear temperature dependent bandgap is
estimated. The predicted value of transition temperature for SnS (SnSe) is
found to be $\sim$700 K, where after this temperature the non-trivial to
trivial topological phase is seen. The strength of EPI shows more stronger
impact on the electronic structure of SnS than SnSe material. The reason of
non-linear behaviour of bandgap with rise in temperature is discussed with the
help of temperature dependent linewidths and lineshifts of conduction band and
valence band due to EPI. The present study reveals the phase stability of SnS
along with the comparative study of thermal effect on EPI of SnS and SnSe.
Further, the possibility of temperature induced topological phase transition
provides one of important behaviour to apply these two materials for device
making application.

the sounds infants make at different ages and in different contexts but do not
fully describe how sounds are perceived by listeners, can be inefficient to

extraction and unsupervised machine learning, specifically Uniform Manifold

clients and the parameter server. Such process would cause privacy leakage
since adversaries may retrieve sensitive information by analyzing the overheard

(local SGD) and partial client participation (PCP) for addressing the issues of

the data privacy whereas the larger number of local SGD steps could increase
privacy leakage, revealing a non-trivial tradeoff between algorithm
communication efficiency and privacy protection. Specifically, we show that, by
guaranteeing $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP for each client per communication round,
the proposed algorithm guarantees $(\mathcal{O}(q\epsilon \sqrt{p T}),
\delta)$-DP after $T$ communication rounds while maintaining an
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{pTQ})$ convergence rate for a convex and non-smooth

  Context: In the previous paper in this series, we identified that a
pentagonal arrangement of five telescopes, using a kernel-nulling beam
combiner, shows notable advantages for some important performance metrics for a
space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer over several other considered
configurations for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets around solar-type
stars.
  Aims: We aim to produce a physical implementation of a kernel-nulling beam
combiner for such a configuration, as well as a discussion of systematic and
stochastic errors associated with the instrument.
  Methods: We developed a mathematical framework around a nulling beam
combiner, and then used it along with a space interferometry simulator to
identify the effects of systematic uncertainties.
  Results: We find that errors in the beam combiner optics, systematic phase
errors and the RMS fringe tracking errors result in instrument limited
performance at $\sim$4-7 $\mu$m, and zodiacal limited at $\gtrsim$10 $\mu$m.
Assuming a beam splitter reflectance error of $|\Delta R| = 5\%$ and phase
shift error of $\Delta\phi = 3$ degrees, we find that the fringe tracking RMS
should be kept to less than 3 nm in order to be photon limited, and the
systematic piston error be less than 0.5 nm to be appropriately sensitive to
planets with a contrast of 1$\times 10^{-7}$ over a 4-19 $\mu$m bandpass. We
also identify that the beam combiner design, with the inclusion of a well
positioned shutter, provides an ability to produce robust kernel observables
even if one or two collecting telescopes were to fail. The resulting four
telescope combiner, when put into an X-array formation, results in a
transmission map with a relative signal-to-noise ratio equivalent to 80% of the
fully functioning X-array combiner.

temporally localize activities or language. End-to-end training for such tasks
is limited by the compute device memory constraints and lack of temporal
annotations at large-scale. These limitations can be addressed by pre-training
on large datasets of temporally trimmed videos supervised by class annotations.
Once the video encoder is pre-trained, it is common practice to freeze it
during fine-tuning. Therefore, the video encoder does not learn temporal
boundaries and unseen classes, causing a domain gap with respect to the
downstream tasks. Moreover, using temporally trimmed videos prevents to capture
the relations between different action categories and the background context in
a video clip which results in limited generalization capacity. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel post-pre-training approach without freezing the
video encoder which leverages language. We introduce a masked contrastive
learning loss to capture visio-linguistic relations between activities,
background video clips and language in the form of captions. Our experiments
show that the proposed approach improves the state-of-the-art on temporal
action localization, few-shot temporal action localization, and video language

In recent years, many efforts have investigated classical machine learning
methods to automate this process. Deep learning techniques have recently
sparked interest as a means of diagnosing brain tumours more accurately and
robustly. The goal of this study, therefore, is to employ brain MRI images to
distinguish between healthy and unhealthy patients (including tumour tissues).

optimal classification. Nonlinear L\'evy Chaotic Moth Flame Optimizer (NLCMFO)

powerful ability in graph data representation and learning. Existing graph
convolution layers are mainly designed based on graph signal processing and
transform aspect which usually suffer from some limitations, such as
over-smoothing, over-squashing and non-robustness, etc. As we all know that
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have received great success in many computer
vision and machine learning. One main aspect is that CNNs leverage many
learnable convolution filters (kernels) to obtain rich feature descriptors and
thus can have high capacity to encode complex patterns in visual data analysis.
Also, CNNs are flexible in designing their network architecture, such as
MobileNet, ResNet, Xception, etc. Therefore, it is natural to arise a question:
can we design graph convolutional layer as flexibly as that in CNNs?
Innovatively, in this paper, we consider connecting GCNs with CNNs deeply from
a general perspective of depthwise separable convolution operation.
Specifically, we show that GCN and GAT indeed perform some specific depthwise
separable convolution operations. This novel interpretation enables us to
better understand the connections between GCNs (GCN, GAT) and CNNs and further
inspires us to design more Unified GCNs (UGCNs). As two showcases, we implement
two UGCNs, i.e., Separable UGCN (S-UGCN) and General UGCN (G-UGCN) for graph
data representation and learning. Promising experiments on several graph
representation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the
proposed UGCNs.

that the SSO-Europa transit midpoint indicates a 6.62-minute variation at 4.40

decays of highly Lorentz-boosted particles. Using an end-to-end deep learning
strategy, the technique bypasses existing rule-based particle reconstruction
methods typically used in high energy physics analyses. It uses minimally
processed detector data as input and directly outputs particle properties of
interest. The new technique is demonstrated for the reconstruction of the
invariant mass of particles decaying in the CMS detector. The decay of a
hypothetical scalar particle $\mathcal{A}$ into two photons,
$\mathcal{A}\to\gamma\gamma$, is chosen as a benchmark decay. Lorentz boosts
$\gamma_\mathrm{L}$ = 60-600 are considered, ranging from regimes where both
photons are resolved to those where the photons are closely merged as one
object. A training method using domain continuation is introduced, enabling the
invariant mass reconstruction of unresolved photon pairs in a novel way. The
new technique is validated using $\pi^0\to$gg decays in LHC collision data.

topology, that is, domains with non-vanishing harmonic Dirichlet and/or Neumann
fields. If the space of harmonic Dirichlet (or Neumann) fields is
infinite-dimensional, there is an abundance of choice of pairwise incomparable
topologies generalising the one for topologically trivial $\Omega$. It will be
demonstrated that if the domain satisfies the Maxwell's compactness property
the corresponding natural version of the corresponding (generalised) nonlocal
$H$-convergence topology has no such ambiguity. Moreover, on multiplication
operators the nonlocal $H$-topology coincides with the one induced by (local)
$H$-convergence introduced by Murat and Tartar. The topology is used to obtain
nonlocal homogenisation results including convergence of the associated energy
for electrostatics. The derived techniques prove useful to deduce a new

robustness-like metamorphic relations, limiting the scope of linguistic

relations, which address the properties of systematicity, compositionality and
transitivity. Unlike robustness, our relations are defined over multiple source
inputs, thus increasing the number of test cases that we can produce by a
polynomial factor. With them, we test the internal consistency of
state-of-the-art NLP models, and show that they do not always behave according
to their expected linguistic properties. Lastly, we introduce a novel graphical

the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and iteratively perform
neighborhood aggregation to propagate the collaborative signals. While
conventional CF models are known for facing the challenges of the popularity
bias that favors popular items, one may wonder ""Whether the existing

performances w.r.t. accuracy and novelty for existing graph-based CF methods.
The empirical results show that symmetric neighborhood aggregation adopted by
most existing graph-based CF models exacerbate the popularity bias and this
phenomenon becomes more serious as the depth of graph propagation increases.
Further, we theoretically analyze the cause of popularity bias for graph-based
CF. Then, we propose a simple yet effective plugin, namely r-AdjNorm, to
achieve an accuracy-novelty trade-off by controlling the normalization strength
in the neighborhood aggregation process. Meanwhile, r-AdjNorm can be smoothly
applied to the existing graph-based CF backbones without additional
computation. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets show
that our proposed method can improve novelty without sacrificing accuracy under

eigenstates, and this coherency is maintained during the propagation due to the
small mass difference of neutrinos. In this paper, we consider the decoherence
due to the neutrino interaction in the material medium with constant density in
addition to the decoherence coming from the localization properties. For this
purpose, we use $l_1\text{-norm}$ in order to quantify the coherence and
investigate its dependence on the matter density. According to our results, in

surrounding vessels are the arteries of interest. Their visualization in case
of an acute stroke is often enabled by Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA).
Still, the identification and analysis of the cerebral arteries remain time
consuming in such scans due to a large number of peripheral vessels which may
disturb the visual impression. In previous work we proposed VirtualDSA++, an
algorithm designed to segment and label the cerebrovascular tree on CTA scans.
Especially with stroke patients, labeling is a delicate procedure, as in the
worst case whole hemispheres may not be present due to impeded perfusion.
Hence, we extended the labeling mechanism for the cerebral arteries to identify
occluded vessels. In the work at hand, we place the algorithm in a clinical
context by evaluating the labeling and occlusion detection on stroke patients,
where we have achieved labeling sensitivities comparable to other works between
92\,\% and 95\,\%. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to
address labeling and occlusion detection at once, whereby a sensitivity of
67\,\% and a specificity of 81\,\% were obtained for the latter. VirtualDSA++
also automatically segments and models the intracranial system, which we
further used in a deep learning driven follow up work. We present the generic
concept of iterative systematic search for pathways on all nodes of said model,
which enables new interactive features. Exemplary, we derive in detail,
firstly, the interactive planning of vascular interventions like the mechanical
thrombectomy and secondly, the interactive suppression of vessel structures
that are not of interest in diagnosing strokes (like veins). We discuss both
features as well as further possibilities emerging from the proposed concept.

20190520B using Tomo-e Gozen, a high-speed CMOS camera mounted on the Kiso
105-cm Schmidt telescope, simultaneously with radio observations carried out
using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We
succeeded in the simultaneous optical observations of 11 radio bursts that FAST
detected. However, no corresponding optical emission was found. The optical
fluence limits as deep as 0.068 Jy ms are obtained for the individual bursts
(0.029 Jy ms on the stacked data) corrected for the dust extinction in the
Milky Way. The fluence limit is deeper than those obtained in the previous
simultaneous observations for an optical emission with a duration $\gtrsim 0.1$
ms. Although the current limits on radio--optical spectral energy distribution
(SED) of FRBs are not constraining, we show that SED models based on observed
SEDs of radio variable objects such as optically detected pulsars, and a part
of parameter spaces of theoretical models in which FRB optical emission is
produced by inverse-Compton scattering in a pulsar magnetosphere or a strike of
a magnetar blastwave into a hot wind bubble, can be ruled out once a similar
fluence limit as in our observation is obtained for a bright FRB with a radio
fluence $\gtrsim 5$ Jy ms.

understanding and harnessing of quantum many-body physics. However, their
complexity makes the inference of such fundamental processes difficult. Thus,
efficient and experimentally non-demanding methods for their diagnosis are
strongly desired. Here, we introduce a general scheme, based on the combination
of finite-size scaling and the linear response of a given observable to a
time-dependent perturbation, to efficiently extract the energy gaps to the
lowest excited states of the system, and thus infer its dynamical critical
exponents. Remarkably, the scheme is able to tackle both integrable and
non-integrable models, prepared away from their ground states. It thus holds
the potential to embody a valuable diagnostic tool for experimentally
significant problems in quantum many-body physics.

propose to extract topological information from room attributes using what we
call Iterative and adaptive graph Topology Learning (ITL). ITL progressively
predicts multiple relations between rooms; at each iteration, it improves node
embeddings, which in turn facilitates generation of a better topological graph
structure. This notion of iterative improvement of node embeddings and
topological graph structure is in the same spirit as \cite{chen2020iterative}.
However, while \cite{chen2020iterative} computes the adjacency matrix based on
node similarity, we learn the graph metric using a relational decoder to
extract room correlations. Experiments using a new challenging indoor dataset
validate our proposed method. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation for

of freedom to their electrons, the so called valley index or valley pseudospin.
This quantity behaves conceptually like the electron spin and the term
valleytronics has been coined. In this context, the group of semiconducting
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) are particularly appealing, due to
large spin-orbit interactions and a direct bandgap at the K points of the
hexagonal Brillouin zone. In this work, we present investigations of excitonic
transitions in mono- and multilayer WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ materials by
time-resolved Faraday ellipticity (TRFE) with in-plane magnetic fields,
$B_{\parallel}$, of up to 9 T. In monolayer samples, the measured TRFE time
traces are almost independent of $B_{\parallel}$, which confirms a close to
zero in-plane exciton $g$ factor $g_\parallel$, consistent with
first-principles calculations. In stark contrast, we observe pronounced
temporal oscillations in multilayer samples for $B_{\parallel}>0$. Remarkably,
the extracted in-plane $g_\parallel$ are very close to reported out-of-plane
exciton $g$ factors of the materials, namely $|g_{\parallel 1s}|=3.1\pm 0.2$
and $2.5\pm0.2$ for the 1s A excitons in WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ multilayers,
respectively. Our first-principles calculations nicely confirm the presence of
a non-zero $g_{\parallel}$ for the multilayer samples. We propose that the
oscillatory TRFE signal in the multilayer samples is caused by pseudospin
quantum beats of excitons, which is a manifestation of spin- and pseudospin
layer locking in the multilayer samples. Our results demonstrate ultrafast
pseudospin rotations in the GHz- to THz frequency range, which pave the way
towards ultrafast pseudospin manipulation in multilayer TMDC samples.

limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle this problem, we
introduce a practical adversarial attack that does not require any queries to
the facial image forgery model. Our method is built on a substitute model
persuing for face reconstruction and then transfers adversarial examples from
the substitute model directly to inaccessible black-box DeepFake models.
Specially, we propose the Transferable Cycle Adversary Generative Adversarial

for 3D wetting from a more microscopic Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian. The
Casimir term changes the interpretation of fluctuation effects occurring at
wetting transitions so that, for example, mean-field predictions are no longer
obtained when interfacial fluctuations are ignored. While the Casimir
contribution does not alter the surface phase diagram, it significantly
increases the adsorption near a first-order wetting transition and changes
completely the predicted critical singularities of tricritical wetting,
including the non-universality occurring in 3D arising from interfacial
fluctuations. Using the numerical renormalization group we show that, for
critical wetting, the asymptotic regime is extremely narrow with the growth of
the parallel correlation length characterised by an effective exponent in
quantitative agreement with Ising model simulations, resolving a longstanding

emission of the surrounding dusty shell. We also find that the dust production
rate of the system decreases rapidly as the stars recede from each other,
though the rate of decrease is significantly lower than the rate of increase
during periastron passage. This was found to be due to strong cooling and its
associated thermal instabilities, resulting in cool, high-density pockets of
gas in the WCR where dust forms. The WCR also shows a degree of hysteresis,
resulting in a radiative post-shock flow even when the stars are separated
enough for the region to behave adiabatically.

$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma_{c}$ hadronic molecules. Together with their four

they present a complete multiplet of hadronic molecules of
$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}$. It is widely recognized that to
understand their nature, other discovery channels play an important role. In
this work, we investigate two three-body decay modes of the
$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}$ molecules. The tree-level modes proceed
via off-shell $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}$ baryons,
$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)} \to
\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\left(\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}\to

$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Lambda_{c}\pi$ are several MeV, as a result can be observed
in the upcoming Run 3 and Run 4 of LHC. The partial decay widths into
$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Lambda_{c}\pi$ of the $P_{c}(4312)$ and $P_{c}(4440)$ states
range from tens to hundreds of keV. In addition, the partial decay widths of
$\bar{D}^{\ast}\Sigma_{c}$ molecules into $J/\psi N \pi$ and $\eta_c N \pi$ are
several keV and tens of keV, respectively, and the partial decay widths of
$\bar{D}^{\ast}\Sigma_{c}^{\ast}$ molecules into $J/\psi N \pi$ vary from
several keV to tens of keV. These three-body decay modes of the pentaquark

robots. One example is soft fluidic robotics, which exploits fluidic power and
stiffness gradients. Porous structures are an interesting type for this
approach, as they are flexible and allow for fluid transport. Within this work,
the Infill-Foam (InFoam) is proposed to print structures with graded porosity
by liquid rope coiling (LRC). By exploiting LRC, the InFoam method could
exploit the repeatable coiling patterns to print structures. To this end, only
the characterization of the relation between nozzle height and coil radius and
the extruded length were necessary (at a fixed temperature). Then by adjusting
the nozzle height and/or extrusion speed the porosity of the printed structure
could be set. The InFoam method was demonstrated by printing porous structures
using styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) with porosities ranging from
46\% to 89\%. In compression tests, the cubes showed large changes in modulus
(more than 200 times), density (-89\% compared to bulk), and energy
dissipation. The InFoam method combined coiling and normal plotting to realize
a large range of porosity gradients. This grading was exploited to realize
rectangular structures with varying deformation patterns, which included
twisting, contraction, and bending. Furthermore, the InFoam method was shown to
be capable of programming the behavior of bending actuators by varying the
porosity. Both the output force and stroke showed correlations similar to those
of the cubes. Thus, the InFoam method can fabricate and program the mechanical
behavior of a soft fluidic (porous) actuator by grading porosity.

follow the evolution of a number of eccentric binary systems with an initial

leads to envelope expansion at the tip of the RGB. The inflated RGB star
engulfs many secondary stars to start a CEE that otherwise would not occur. If
the secondary star manages to remove most of the RGB envelope the primary
evolves to become an EHB star with a mass of ~0.47Mo. However, we expect that
in most cases the secondary star does not have time to spiral-in to close
orbits. It rather ends at a large orbit and leaves a massive enough envelope
for the primary star to later evolve along the asymptotic giant branch and to
engulf the secondary star, therefore forming a non-spherical planetary nebula.

perimeter, the contribution from purchasing goods and services is dominant,
about 40% of the total, slightly exceeding the contribution from professional

make a smaller contribution to IRAP's carbon footprint, about 25% over the

since the energy used to produce the electricity and heating has a relatively
low carbon footprint. Over the full perimeter, the large share from the use of
ground-based observatories and space-borne facilities and the fact that the

classifiers may perform poorly on out-of-distribution samples because spurious
correlations between non-robust features and labels can be changed in a new
environment. By analyzing procedures for out-of-distribution generalization
with a causal graph, we show that standard classifiers fail because the
association between images and labels is not transportable across settings.
However, we then show that the causal effect, which severs all sources of
confounding, remains invariant across domains. This motivates us to develop an
algorithm to estimate the causal effect for image classification, which is
transportable (i.e., invariant) across source and target environments. Without
observing additional variables, we show that we can derive an estimand for the
causal effect under empirical assumptions using representations in deep models
as proxies. Theoretical analysis, empirical results, and visualizations show
that our approach captures causal invariances and improves overall

models with interactions. We consider models with low-order interactions and
develop a simple and intuitive approach based on first principles. We then show
how the methodology generalizes to the well-known Shapely decomposition and the

techniques in the literature for local interpretability of machine learning
results, B-Shap is computationally tractable since it involves just function

unpaired nighttime infrared and daytime visible videos are even huger than
paired ones that captured at the same time, establishing an effective
translation mapping will greatly contribute to various fields. In this case,
the structural knowledge within nighttime infrared videos and semantic
information contained in the translated daytime visible pairs could be utilized
simultaneously. To this end, we propose a tailored framework ROMA that couples
with our introduced cRoss-domain regiOn siMilarity mAtching technique for
bridging the huge gaps. To be specific, ROMA could efficiently translate the

introduce the strain at the hetero-interface, and present sensitivity to
humidity, which strongly limits the further exploration of the hetero-interface
between electrolyte and 2D materials, and their wide applications for

solid-state electrolyte, the character of the electric double layer (EDL) at
hetero-interface and its effect on the optical property of transition metal
chalcogenides (TMDs) have been revealed by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)
and (time-resolved) photoluminescence measurements. The work function of TMDs
can be strongly tailored by electrochemical gating, up to 0.7eV for WSe2 and
0.3 eV for MoS2, respectively. Besides, from the gate-dependent surface
potential of TMDs with different thicknesses, the potential drop across the EDL
has been quantitatively revealed. Furthermore, from the gate-dependent PL
emission at room temperature, monolayer WS2 exhibits only neutral exciton
emission in the whole range of gate voltage applied, which also exhibits
exciton-exciton annihilation. Our results demonstrate that lithium-ion

Implementing Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for non-safety related applications

out-of-distribution samples that are outside of the scope of a DNN, but which
result in high confidence outputs despite no prior knowledge of such input.
  In this paper, we analyze three methods that separate between in- and

computational models to estimate thermal comfort (TC). Given the impetus toward
energy efficiency, the current focus is on data-driven TC prediction solutions
that leverage state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, an
indoor occupant's perception of indoor thermal comfort (TC) is subjective and
multi-dimensional. Different aspects of TC are represented by various standard
metrics/scales viz., thermal sensation (TSV), thermal comfort (TCV), and
thermal preference (TPV). The current ML-based TC prediction solutions adopt
the Single-task Learning approach, i.e., one prediction model per metric.
Consequently, solutions often focus on only one TC metric. Moreover, when
several metrics are considered, multiple TC models for a single indoor space
lead to conflicting predictions, making real-world deployment infeasible. This
work addresses these problems. With the vision toward energy conservation and
real-world application, naturally ventilated primary school classrooms are
considered. First, month-long field experiments are conducted in 5 schools and
14 classrooms, including 512 unique student participants. Further,
""DeepComfort,"" a Multi-task Learning inspired deep-learning model is proposed.
DeepComfort predicts multiple TC output metrics viz., TSV, TPV, and TCV,
simultaneously, through a single model. It demonstrates high F1-scores,
Accuracy (>90%), and generalization capability when validated on the ASHRAE-II

skyrmionic 2D spin-lattices in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. However,
recent examples suggest that the requirements for topological superconductivity
are complicated by the multi-orbital nature of the magnetic components and
disorder effects. Here, we investigate Fe monolayer islands grown on a surface
of the s-wave superconductor with the largest gap of all elemental
superconductors, Nb, with respect to magnetism and superconductivity using
spin-resolved scanning tunneling spectrosopy. We find three types of Fe
monolayer islands which differ by their reconstruction inducing disorder, the
magnetism and the sub-gap electronic states. All three types are ferromagnetic
with different coercive fields indicating diverse exchange and anisotropy
energies. On all three islands, there is finite spectral weight throughout the
substrate's energy gap at the expense of the coherence peak intensity,
indicating the formation of Shiba bands overlapping with the Fermi energy. The
gap filling and coherence peak reduction is strongest for the island with
largest coercive field. A strong lateral variation of the spectral weight of
the Shiba bands signifies substantial disorder on the order of the substrate's
pairing energy with a length scale of the period of the three different

In order to shed light on the role of BN in adversarial training, we
investigate to what extent the expressiveness of BN can be used to robustify
fragile features in comparison to random features. On CIFAR10, we find that
adversarially fine-tuning just the BN layers can result in non-trivial

time-resolution limitations to these systems, which makes simultaneous high
spectral and temporal resolution impossible. Here, we demonstrate an FT
spectrometer whose operational principle is based on continuous rotational,
rather than linear, motion of the scanning mirror, decoupling the spectral
resolution from the temporal one. This enables 0.5 cm${}^{-1}$ resolution on
sub-ms time scales. Furthermore, we show that such rotational FT spectrometers
can perform dual-comb spectroscopy with a single comb source, since the
Doppler-shifted version of the comb serves as the second comb. In this way, we
combine the advantages of dual-comb and FT spectroscopy using a single quantum
cascade laser frequency comb as a light source. Our technique does not require
any diffractive or dispersive optical elements and hence preserve the
Jacquinot's-, Fellgett's-, and Connes'-advantages of FT spectrometers. The
system supports a large optical bandwidth from visible to THz frequencies. The

drive constellations' performance in this new context, and are no exception to
real-time and scalability requirements. The majority of frequency assignment
methods proposed in the literature fail to fulfill these two requirements, or
are unable to meet them without falling short on bandwidth and/or power

to prioritize operational requirements. We present an algorithm based on
Integer Linear Programming (ILP) that is able to fully define a frequency plan
while respecting key system constraints such as handovers and interference. We
are able to encode operators' goals such as bandwidth maximization or power
reduction and produce optimal or quasi-optimal plans according to such
objectives. In our experiments, we find our method is able to allocate at least
50% more bandwidth and reduce power consumption by 40% compared to previous

offers a continuous metric for extracting information in noisy images. Finally,
our empirical results on information recovery from various inversion attacks

generalization of Brownian motion and the mean-reverting process referred to as
the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with time-dependent
coefficients. Using past observed values of the input time series, these
coefficients can be regressed online by the cells of the first half of the
network (Reg). The regressed coefficients depend only on - but are very
sensitive to - a small number of hyperparameters required to be set by a global
optimization procedure for which, Bayesian optimization is an adequate
heuristic. Thanks to its multi-layered architecture, the second half of the
regression network (Pred) can project time-dependent values for the OU process
coefficients and generate realistic trajectories of the time series.
Predictions can be easily derived in the form of expected values estimated by
averaging values obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The forecasting accuracy
on a 100 days horizon is evaluated for several of the most important FX rates

incorporation of new concepts (classes) over time, referred to as Class
Incremental Learning (CIL). The major challenge in CIL is catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., preserving as much of the old knowledge as possible while
learning new tasks. Various techniques, such as regularization, knowledge
distillation, and the use of exemplars, have been proposed to resolve this
issue. However, prior works primarily focus on the incremental learning step,
while ignoring the optimization during the base model training. We hypothesize
that a more transferable and generalizable feature representation from the base
model would be beneficial to incremental learning.
  In this work, we adopt multitask learning during base model training to
improve the feature generalizability. Specifically, instead of training a
single model with all the base classes, we decompose the base classes into
multiple subsets and regard each of them as a task. These tasks are trained
concurrently and a shared feature extractor is obtained for incremental
learning. We evaluate our approach on two datasets under various
configurations. The results show that our approach enhances the average
incremental learning accuracy by up to 5.5%, which enables more reliable and
accurate keyword spotting over time. Moreover, the proposed approach can be

years. Current deep learning models for code summarization generally follow the
principle in neural machine translation and adopt the encoder-decoder
framework, where the encoder learns the semantic representations from source
code and the decoder transforms the learnt representations into human-readable
text that describes the functionality of code snippets. Despite they achieve
the new state-of-the-art performance, we notice that current models often
either generate less fluent summaries, or fail to capture the core
functionality, since they usually focus on a single type of code
representations. As such we propose GypSum, a new deep learning model that
learns hybrid representations using graph attention neural networks and a
pre-trained programming and natural language model. We introduce particular
edges related to the control flow of a code snippet into the abstract syntax
tree for graph construction, and design two encoders to learn from the graph
and the token sequence of source code, respectively. We modify the
encoder-decoder sublayer in the Transformer's decoder to fuse the
representations and propose a dual-copy mechanism to facilitate summary
generation. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GypSum
over existing code summarization models.

even experts struggle with difficult tasks while sloppy workers can get easy

examination tasks should have moderate degree of difficulty and
discriminability to score workers more objectively. Thus, we first score
workers' ability mainly on the medium difficult tasks, then reducing the weight

the focus of the work presented here. Polycrystalline thin film Sb$_2$Se$_3$
absorbers and solar cells are prepared in substrate configuration and the
dominant recombination path is studied using photoluminescence spectroscopy and
temperature dependent current-voltage characteristics. It is found that a
post-deposition annealing after the CdS buffer layer deposition can effectively
remove interface recombination since the activation energy of the dominant
recombination path becomes equal to the bandgap of the Sb$_2$Se$_3$ absorber.
The increased activation energy is accompanied by an increased
photoluminescence yield, i.e. reduced non-radiative recombination. Finished
Sb$_2$Se$_3$ solar cell devices reach open circuit voltages as high as 485 mV.
Contrarily, the short-circuit current density of these devices is limiting the
efficiency after the post-deposition annealing. It is shown that atomic layer
deposited intermediate buffer layers such as TiO$_2$ or Sb$_2$Se$_3$ can pave
the way for overcoming this limitation.

Yet, the fill factor of these solar cells, with best values around 80 %, is

Recently, we proposed metastable defects, a general feature of the Cu(In,Ga)Se2
alloy, to be the origin of the increased diode factor. We measure the diode
factor of the bare absorber layers by excitation-dependent photoluminescence.
For high quality and thus high luminescent polycrystalline absorbers, we
evaluate the diode factor excitation dependence over four orders of magnitude.
Using simulations and the model of metastable defects, we can well describe the
experimental findings on n- and p-type epitaxial films as well as the
polycrystalline absorbers, providing additional evidence for this model. We
find that the diode factors measured optically by photoluminescence impose a
lower limit for the diode factor measured electrically on a finished solar
cell. Interestingly, the lowest diode factor (optical and electrical) and
consequently highest fill factor of 81.0 % is obtained by Ag alloying, i.e. an

factors and thus efficiencies for Cu(In,Ga)Se2-based solar cells.

and additional factors; a systematic way is required for expressing knowledge
and facilitating communication between scientists in various fields. A function
decomposition tree is such a representation, but domain scientists face
difficulty in constructing it. Thus, this study cites the general problems
encountered by beginners in generating function decomposition trees and
proposes a new function decomposition representation method based on a
causality-first perspective for resolution of these problems. The
causality-first decomposition tree was obtained from a workflow expressed
according to the processing sequence. Moreover, we developed a program that
performed automatic conversion using the features of the causality-first
decomposition trees. The proposed method was applied to materials informatics
to demonstrate the systematic representation of expert knowledge and its
usefullness.

produced from small molecules such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and N$_2$. Devices with
physical separation of the anodic and cathodic zones, photoelectrochemical-type

operation that affect the current density and relations with device
architecture are first discussed. Aspects relevant to device design in relation
to practical use are also commented on. Then discussion is moved towards the
relevance of these aspects to compare the behaviour in the state-of-the-art of
the conversion of these small molecules, with focus on solar fuels from H$_2$O,
CO$_2$ and N$_2$ conversion, highligthing the gaps and perspectives of such
technologies. The still significant lack of crucial data, notwithstanding the
extensive literature on the topic, has to be remarked on, particularly in terms
of the need to operate these cells in conjunction with sun concentration (in
the 50-100 sun range) which emerges as the necessary direction from this
analysis, with consequent aspects in terms of cell and materials design to
operate in these conditions. The work provides a guide for the optimisation of
the investigated technology and the fixing of their practical limits for
large-scale applications.

often using Genetic Programming.
  Since there is usually no restriction to what form the function can have,
Genetic Programming may return a hard to understand model due to non-linear
function chaining or long expressions. A novel representation called
Interaction-Transformation was recently proposed to alleviate this problem. In
this representation, the function form is restricted to an affine combination
of terms generated as the application of a single univariate function to the
interaction of selected variables. This representation obtained competing
solutions on standard benchmarks. Despite the initial success, a broader set of
benchmarking functions revealed the limitations of the constrained
representation.
  In this paper we propose an extension to this representation, called
Transformation-Interaction-Rational representation that defines a new function
form as the rational of two Interaction-Transformation functions. Additionally,
the target variable can also be transformed with an univariate function. The
main goal is to improve the approximation power while still constraining the
overall complexity of the expression.
  We tested this representation with a standard Genetic Programming with
crossover and mutation. The results show a great improvement when compared to
its predecessor and a state-of-the-art performance for a large benchmark.

be used to meet performance objectives of applications. However, the failure of
a single node may result in cascading failures that will adversely impact the
delivery of the service and will result in failure to meet specific objectives.
The impact of these failures needs to be minimised at runtime. Three techniques
are explored in this paper, namely repartitioning, early-exit and
skip-connection. When an edge node fails, the repartitioning technique will
repartition and redeploy the DNN thus avoiding the failed nodes. The early-exit
technique makes provision for a request to exit (early) before the failed node.
The skip connection technique dynamically routes the request by skipping the
failed nodes. This paper will leverage trade-offs in accuracy, end-to-end
latency and downtime for selecting the best technique given user-defined
objectives (accuracy, latency and downtime thresholds) when an edge node fails.
To this end, CONTINUER is developed. Two key activities of the framework are
estimating the accuracy and latency when using the techniques for distributed
DNNs and selecting the best technique. It is demonstrated on a lab-based
experimental testbed that CONTINUER estimates accuracy and latency when using
the techniques with no more than an average error of 0.28% and 13.06%,
respectively and selects the suitable technique with a low overhead of no more
than 16.82 milliseconds and an accuracy of up to 99.86%.
