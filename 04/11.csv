moored in a harbour or coastal waters require an accurate description of the
(nonlinear) evolution of waves over variable bottom topography, the
interactions of the waves with the structure, and the dynamics of the mooring
system. In this paper, we present a new advanced numerical model to simulate
the wave-induced response of a floating structure that is moored in an
arbitrary nearshore region. The model is based on the non-hydrostatic approach,
and implemented in the open-source model SWASH, which provides an efficient
numerical framework to simulate the nonlinear wave evolution over variable
bottom topographies. The model is extended with a solution to the rigid body
that is tightly coupled to the hydrodynamic equations. The model was validated
for two test cases that consider different floating structures of increasing
geometrical complexity: a cylindrical geometry that is representative of a
wave-energy-converter, and a vessel with a more complex shaped hull. A range of
wave conditions were considered, varying from monochromatic to short-crested
sea states. Model predictions of the excitation forces, added mass, radiation
damping, and the wave-induced response agreed well with benchmark solutions to
the potential flow equations. Besides the response to the primary wave
(sea-swell) components, the model was also able to capture the second-order
difference-frequency forcing and response of the moored vessel. Importantly,
the model captured the wave-induced response with a relatively coarse vertical
resolution, allowing for applications at the scale of a realistic harbour or
coastal region. The proposed model thereby provides a new tool to seamlessly
simulate the nonlinear evolution of waves over complex bottom topography and
the wave-induced response of a floating structure that is moored in coastal
waters.

neutral particle ($\eta$), which violates both the baryon number
($\mathcal{B}$) and the lepton number ($\mathcal{L}$) by one unit but conserves
their difference $(\mathcal{B}-\mathcal{L})$. Such mixing may give rise to
non-trivial effects that are different from the Standard Model predictions. We
organize our discussions based on two scenarios, roughly depending on whether
an interference between oscillation and decay occurs, or whether the
new-physics effects associated with the $n$-$\eta$ mixing contribute to the
absorptive mixing amplitude. If an oscillation process is not accompanied by an
interference between oscillation and decay, or the new-physics interactions do
not contribute to the absorptive mixing amplitude, such a process can be
classified as pure oscillation. Otherwise, it can be classified as impure
oscillation. In the scenario of pure oscillation, CP-violation arising from the
Majorana phase can manifest itself through the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation
process and may lead to observable effects. In the scenario of impure
oscillation, we analyze the testable implications on the masses and lifetimes
of the mass eigenstates formed as a result of the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation
mediated by $\eta$. In this scenario, we also suggest a unified interpretation
of the neutron lifetime anomaly and the $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation measurements
based on the $n$-$\eta$ mixing. In both scenarios, we present the lower bounds
imposed by the experimental searches for $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillations on the
masses of the color multiplet bosons and point out that they could be within
the reach of a direct detection at the LHC or future high-energy experiments.

sliding window model of computation. In this model, the input consists of a
sequence of weighted edges on a given vertex set $V$ of size $n$. The objective
is to maintain an approximation of a maximum-weight matching in the graph
spanned by the $L$ most recent edges, for some integer $L$, using as little
space as possible. Prior to our work, the state-of-the-art results were a
$(3.5+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for MWM by Biabani et al.
[ISAAC'21] and a $(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation for (unweighted) Maximum
Matching (MM) by Crouch et al. [ESA'13]. Both algorithms use space
$\tilde{O}(n)$.
  We give the following results:
  1. We give a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for MWM with space
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nL})$. Under the reasonable assumption that the graphs spanned
by the edges in each sliding window are simple, our algorithm uses space
$\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{n})$.
  2. In the $\tilde{O}(n)$ space regime, we give a
$(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for MWM, thereby closing the gap
between the best-known approximation ratio for MWM and MM.
  Similar to Biabani et al.'s MWM algorithm, both our algorithms execute
multiple instances of the $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation $\tilde{O}(n)$-space
streaming algorithm for MWM by Paz and Schwartzman [SODA'17] on different
portions of the stream. Our improvements are obtained by selecting these
substreams differently. Furthermore, our $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm runs the Paz-Schwartzman algorithm in reverse direction over some
parts of the stream, and in forward direction over other parts, which allows
for an improved approximation guarantee at the cost of increased space
requirements.

crossover is described by a non-linear system which interpolates between the
derivative and the standard non-linear Schrodinger equations in imaginary time.
We solve this system using the inverse scattering method for mixed-time
boundary conditions introduced by us to solve the WNT. We obtain the rate
function which describes the large deviations of the sample-to-sample

a crossover as the asymmetry is varied, recovering both MFT and KPZ limits. We
sketch how it is consistent with extracting the asymptotics of a Fredholm
determinant formula, recently derived for sticky Brownian motions. The
crossover mechanism studied here should generalize to a larger class of models
described by the MFT. Our results apply to study extremal diffusion beyond

networks, downlink channel state information (CSI) is required at the base

through a feedback signal from the user equipment (UE). However, this may lead
to an important overhead in FDD massive MIMO systems. Focusing on these
systems, in this study, we propose a novel strategy to design the CSI feedback.
Our strategy allows to optimally design variable length feedback, that is
promising compared to fixed feedback since users experience channel matrices
differently sparse. Specifically, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to
compress the channel into a latent space with adaptive dimensionality. To
quantize this compressed channel, the feedback bits are smartly allocated to
the latent space dimensions by minimizing the normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) distortion. Finally, the quantization codebook is determined with
k-means clustering. Numerical simulations show that our strategy improves the
zero-forcing beamforming sum rate by 17%, compared to CsiNetPro. The number of
model parameters is reduced by 23.4 times, thus causing a significantly smaller
offloading overhead. At the same time, PCA is characterized by a lightweight

capture and even amplify the biases on news providers, and are unfair for some
minority news providers. In this paper, we propose a provider fairness-aware
news recommendation framework (named ProFairRec), which can learn news
recommendation models fair for different news providers from biased user data.
The core idea of ProFairRec is to learn provider-fair news representations and
provider-fair user representations to achieve provider fairness. To learn
provider-fair representations from biased data, we employ provider-biased
representations to inherit provider bias from data. Provider-fair and -biased
news representations are learned from news content and provider IDs
respectively, which are further aggregated to build fair and biased user
representations based on user click history. All of these representations are
used in model training while only fair representations are used for user-news
matching to achieve fair news recommendation. Besides, we propose an
adversarial learning task on news provider discrimination to prevent
provider-fair news representation from encoding provider bias. We also propose
an orthogonal regularization on provider-fair and -biased representations to
better reduce provider bias in provider-fair representations. Moreover,
ProFairRec is a general framework and can be applied to different news
recommendation methods. Extensive experiments on a public dataset verify that
our ProFairRec approach can effectively improve the provider fairness of many
existing methods and meanwhile maintain their recommendation accuracy.

diffeomorphism from the degree $3$ Fock-Thomas space $\mathcal{T}^3(S)$ of
higher complex structures to the $\text{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ Hitchin component.
Our construction is equivariant with respect to natural actions of the mapping
class group $\text{Mod}(S)$. For all $n \geq 3$, we show that the Fock-Thomas
space $\mathcal{T}^n(S)$ has a canonical vector bundle structure over
Teichm\""uller space. We then construct a $\text{Mod}(S)$-equivariant bundle
isomorphism from $\mathcal{T}^n(S)$ to a sub-bundle of the restriction of the
tangent bundle of the $\text{PSL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ Hitchin component to the
Fuchsian locus. As consequences, we prove that the higher degree moduli space
of complex structures is a bundle over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and
that the action of $\text{Mod}(S)$ on $\mathcal{T}^n(S)$ is a proper action by
holomorphic automorphisms with respect to a canonical complex structure. The
core of our approach is a careful analysis of higher degree diffeomorphism
groups.

neural activity via supervised learning. However, since generally there is a
strong connection between learning of subjects and their expectations on
long-term rewards, we propose NeuRL, an inverse reinforcement learning approach
that (1) extracts an intrinsic reward function from collected trajectories of a
subject in closed form, (2) maps neural signals to this intrinsic reward to
account for long-term dependencies in the behavior and (3) predicts the
simulated behavior for unseen neural signals by extracting Q-values and the
corresponding Boltzmann policy based on the intrinsic reward values for these
unseen neural signals. We show that NeuRL leads to better generalization and
improved decoding performance compared to supervised approaches. We study the
behavior of rats in a response-preparation task and evaluate the performance of
NeuRL within simulated inhibition and per-trial behavior prediction. By
assigning clear functional roles to defined neuronal populations our approach
offers a new interpretation tool for complex neuronal data with testable
predictions. In per-trial behavior prediction, our approach furthermore
improves accuracy by up to 15% compared to traditional methods.

Multimodal recognition mitigates a number of such issues: prediction outcomes
of different sensors complement each other due to different modality-specific
strengths and weaknesses. While several late fusion methods have been
considered in previously published frameworks, they constantly feature
different architecture backbones and building blocks making it very hard to
isolate the role of the chosen late fusion strategy itself. This paper presents
an empirical evaluation of different paradigms for decision-level late fusion
in video-based driver observation. We compare seven different mechanisms for
joining the results of single-modal classifiers which have been both popular,
(e.g. score averaging) and not yet considered (e.g. rank-level fusion) in the
context of driver observation evaluating them based on different criteria and
benchmark settings. This is the first systematic study of strategies for fusing
outcomes of multimodal predictors inside the vehicles, conducted with the goal
to provide guidance for fusion scheme selection.

they have indirect bandgap, which is not good for solar cell applications. Only
those conformers, which have favourable thermodynamics and structural

infer that Sn substitution is more favorable than that of Ge in replacing Pb

very expensive and challenging. Over the past few years, I have built two
methods to address this challenge, one via direct density functional theory
(DFT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the other via deep learning graph
neural networks. The DFT approach is based on statistical analysis of
small-size solid-liquid coexistence MD simulations. It eliminates the risk of
metastable superheated solid in the fast-heating method, while also
significantly reducing the computer cost relative to the traditional
large-scale coexistence method. Being both accurate and efficient (at the speed
of several days per material), it is considered as one of the best methods for
direct DFT melting temperature calculation. The deep learning method is based
on graph neural networks that effectively handles permutation invariance in
chemical formula, which drastically improves efficiency and reduces cost. At
the speed of milliseconds per material, the model is extremely fast, while
being moderately accurate, especially within the composition space expanded by
the dataset. I have implemented both methods into automated computer code
packages, making them publicly available and free to download. The DFT and deep
learning methods are highly complementary to each other, and hence they can be
potentially well integrated into a framework for melting temperature
prediction. I demonstrated examples of applying the methods to materials design

paper we perform a comparative empirical analysis of Copilot-generated code
from a security perspective. The aim of this study is to determine if Copilot
is as bad as human developers. We investigate whether Copilot is just as likely
to introduce the same software vulnerabilities as human developers. Using a
dataset of C/C++ vulnerabilities, we prompt Copilot to generate suggestions in
scenarios that led to the introduction of vulnerabilities by human developers.
The suggestions are inspected and categorized in a 2-stage process based on
whether the original vulnerability or fix is reintroduced. We find that Copilot
replicates the original vulnerable code about 33% of the time while replicating
the fixed code at a 25% rate. However this behaviour is not consistent: Copilot
is more likely to introduce some types of vulnerabilities than others and is
also more likely to generate vulnerable code in response to prompts that
correspond to older vulnerabilities. Overall, given that in a significant
number of cases it did not replicate the vulnerabilities previously introduced
by human developers, we conclude that Copilot, despite performing differently
across various vulnerability types, is not as bad as human developers at

problem that models solidification and melting processes. It is assumed that
the physical domain is filled by a medium whose state is liquid on the left and
solid, with constant temperature, on the right. In between we find a
free-boundary (the interface that separates the liquid from the solid). In the
liquid domain, a parabolic equation completed with initial and boundary
conditions must be satisfied by the temperature. On the interface, an
additional free-boundary requirement, called the {\it Stefan condition,} is
imposed. We prove the local exact controllability to the (smooth) trajectories.
To this purpose, we first reformulate the problem as the local null
controllability of a coupled PDE-ODE system with distributed controls. Then, a
new Carleman inequality for the adjoint of the linearized PDE-ODE system,
coupled on the boundary through nonlocal in space and memory terms, is
presented. This leads to the null controllability of an appropriate linear
system. Finally, a local result is obtained via local inversion, by using {\it
Liusternik-Graves' Theorem}. As a byproduct of our approach, we find that some
parabolic equations which contains memory terms localized on the boundary are
null-controllable.

the values that are 2-times and 2-orders of magnitude higher, respectively
compared to NCO or MWCNT alone. This offers straightforward application in
optical limiting with optical limiting (FOL) and optical onset (FON) threshold
ca. 2-10 times lower than benchmark NLO materials, e.g., graphene, family of

NCO. Notably, for femtosecond pumping, NLO response of NCO@MWCNT is dominated
by saturable absorption (SA) with a week contribution from two photon

reversal along with a larger amplitude is obtained for n2 thanks to the charge

  Using Satellite Image","accepted to CVPR2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of vehicle-mounted camera localization by
matching a ground-level image with an overhead-view satellite map. Existing
methods often treat this problem as cross-view image retrieval, and use learned
deep features to match the ground-level query image to a partition (eg, a small
patch) of the satellite map. By these methods, the localization accuracy is
limited by the partitioning density of the satellite map (often in the order of
tens meters). Departing from the conventional wisdom of image retrieval, this
paper presents a novel solution that can achieve highly-accurate localization.
The key idea is to formulate the task as pose estimation and solve it by
neural-net based optimization. Specifically, we design a two-branch {CNN} to
extract robust features from the ground and satellite images, respectively. To
bridge the vast cross-view domain gap, we resort to a Geometry Projection
module that projects features from the satellite map to the ground-view, based
on a relative camera pose. Aiming to minimize the differences between the
projected features and the observed features, we employ a differentiable
Levenberg-Marquardt ({LM}) module to search for the optimal camera pose
iteratively. The entire pipeline is differentiable and runs end-to-end.
Extensive experiments on standard autonomous vehicle localization datasets have
confirmed the superiority of the proposed method. Notably, e.g., starting from
a coarse estimate of camera location within a wide region of 40m x 40m, with an
80% likelihood our method quickly reduces the lateral location error to be
within 5m on a new KITTI cross-view dataset.

network might be considered a reflection of underlying dynamics in some latent
space, whereby nodes are associated with dynamic locations and their relative
distances drive their interaction tendencies. As time passes nodes can change
their locations assuming new configurations, with different interaction
patterns. The aim of this paper is to define a dynamic latent space relational
event model. We then develop a computationally efficient method for inferring
the locations of the nodes. We make use of the Expectation Maximization
algorithm which embeds an extension of the universal Kalman filter. Kalman
filters are known for being effective tools in the context of tracking objects
in the space, with successful applications in fields such as geolocalization.
We extend its application to dynamic networks by filtering the signal from a

unlike the compressible Euler equations whose smooth solutions must blow up in
finite time no matter how small and how smooth the initial data is, the
dissipative structure of such a radiation hydrodynamics model can indeed
guarantee that its one-dimensional Cauchy problem admits a unique global smooth
solution provided that the initial data is sufficiently small, while for large
initial data, even if the heat conductivity is taken into account but the
viscosity effect is ignored, shock type singularities must appear in finite
time for smooth solutions of the Cauchy problem of one-dimensional radiation
hydrodynamics model with thermal conductivity and zero viscosity. Thus a
natural question is, if effects of both the viscosity and the thermal
conductivity are considered, does the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics
model with viscosity and thermal conductivity exist a unique global large
solution? We give an affirmative answer to this problem and show in this paper
that the initial-boundary value problem to the radiation hydrodynamics model in

does exist a unique global smooth solution for any large initial data. The main
ingredient in our analysis is to introduce some delicate estimates, especially
an improved estimate on the absolute temperature and a pointwise estimate

Fisher's dangerous-irrelevant-variable formalism applied to thermodynamic

the RG with analytical and numerical results for Ising systems. We explain how
the extension of dangerous irrelevancy to the correlation sector is key to
marrying the above concepts into a comprehensive RG scaling picture that
renders hyperscaling and finite-size scaling valid in all dimensions. We
collect what we believe is the current status of the theory, including some new
insights and results. This paper is in grateful memory of Michael Fisher who

due to dubious assumptions and corrupted data. Traditionally, this placed
special emphasis on risk-based and robust formulations, and their focus on

based on Rockafellian relaxations in which optimization is conducted not only
over the original decision space but also jointly with a choice of model
perturbation. The framework enables us to address challenging problems with
ambiguous probability distributions from the areas of two-stage stochastic
optimization without relatively complete recourse, probability functions
lacking continuity properties, expectation constraints, and outlier analysis.
We are also able to circumvent the fundamental difficulty in stochastic
optimization that convergence of distributions fails to guarantee convergence
of expectations. The framework centers on the novel concepts of exact and
asymptotically exact Rockafellians, with interpretations of ``negative''
regularization emerging in certain settings. We illustrate the role of
Phi-divergence, examine rates of convergence under changing distributions, and
explore extensions to first-order optimality conditions. The main development
is free of assumptions about convexity, smoothness, and even continuity of
objective functions. Numerical results in the setting of computer vision with

prediction, $M_{W}^{\rm SM}=80357 \pm 6 \,$MeV. Such a large discrepancy may be
partially due to exotic particles that radiatively alter the relation between
the W and Z boson masses. In this Letter, we study singlet extensions of the
Standard Model focusing on the shift of the W boson mass. In the minimal
extension with a real singlet field, using the bounds from the electroweak
oblique parameters, B meson decays, LEP, and LHC, we find that the W boson mass
shift is at most a few MeV, and therefore it does not alleviate the tension
between the CDF II result and the SM prediction. We then examine how much
various bounds are relaxed when the singlet is allowed to decay invisibly and
find that the increase of the W boson mass does not exceed $5$ MeV due to the
bound from the Higgs signal strength. We also discuss phenomenological and
cosmological implications of the singlet extensions such as the muon $g-2$
anomaly, axion/hidden photon dark matter, and self-interacting dark radiation
as a possible alleviation of the Hubble tension.

on $\mathbf P^1$ defined by the $n+3$ forgetful maps $\mathcal
M_{0,n+3}\rightarrow \mathcal M_{0,n+2}$. We recall classical results which
show that this web is linearizable when $n$ is odd, or is equivalent to a web
by conics when $n$ is even. We then turn to the abelian relations (ARs) of
these webs. After recalling the well-known case when $n=2$ (related to the
5-terms functional identity of the dilogarithm), we focus on the case of the
6-web $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{0,6}}$. We show that this web is isomorphic to
the web formed by the lines contained in Segre's cubic primal
$\boldsymbol{S}\subset \mathbf P^4$ and that a kind of `Abel's theorem' allows
to describe the ARs of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{0,6}}$ by means of the
abelian 2-forms on the Fano surface $F_1(\boldsymbol{S})\subset G_1(\mathbf
P^4)$ of lines contained in $\boldsymbol{S}$. We deduce from this that
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{0,6}}$ has maximal rank with all its ARs rational,
and that these span a space which is an irreducible $\mathfrak S_6$-module.
Then we take up an approach due to Damiano that we correct in the case when $n$
is odd: it leads to an abstract description of the space of ARs of
$\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{0,n+3}$ as a $\mathfrak S_{n+3}$-representation. In
particular, we obtain that this web has maximal rank for any $n\geq 2$.
Finally, we consider `Euler's abelian relation $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}_n$', a
particular AR for $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{0,n+3}$ constructed by Damiano from
a characteristic class on the grassmannian of 2-planes in $\mathbf R^{n+3}$ by
means of Gelfand-MacPherson theory of polylogarithmic forms. We give an
explicit conjectural formula for the components of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}_n$

transport phenomena with applications in spintronics and quantum information.
The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized
spins and itinerant states comprising the topological bands, and the subsequent
formation of an exchange gap. However, this interaction has never been measured
in any intrinsic magnetic topological material. Using a multimodal approach,
this exchange interaction is measured in MnBi2Te4, the first realized intrinsic
magnetic topological insulator. Interrogating nonequilibrium spin dynamics,
itinerant bands are found to exhibit a strong exchange coupling to localized Mn
spins. Momentum-resolved ultrafast electron scattering and magneto-optic
measurements reveal that itinerant spins disorder via electron-phonon
scattering at picosecond timescales. Localized Mn spins, probed by resonant
X-ray scattering, disorder concurrently with itinerant spins, despite being
energetically decoupled from the initial excitation. Modeling the results using
atomistic simulations, the exchange coupling between localized and itinerant
spins is estimated to be >100 times larger than superexchange interactions.
This implies an exchange gap of >25 meV should occur in the topological surface
states. By directly quantifying local-itinerant exchange coupling, this work
validates the materials-by-design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic
order to create and manipulate magnetic topological phases, from static to
ultrafast timescales.

unauthorized distribution of such datasets) concerns since location data
contain users' sensitive information, e.g., regular moving patterns and
favorite spots. To address this, we propose a novel fingerprinting scheme that
simultaneously identifies unauthorized redistribution of location datasets and
provides differential privacy guarantees for the shared data. Observing data
utility degradation due to differentially-private mechanisms, we introduce a
utility-focused post-processing scheme to regain spatio-temporal correlations
between points in a location trajectory. We further integrate this
post-processing scheme into our fingerprinting scheme as a sampling method. The
proposed fingerprinting scheme alleviates the degradation in the utility of the
shared dataset due to the noise introduced by differentially-private mechanisms
(i.e., adds the fingerprint by preserving the publicly known statistics of the
data). Meanwhile, it does not violate differential privacy throughout the
entire process due to immunity to post-processing, a fundamental property of
differential privacy. Our proposed fingerprinting scheme is robust against
known and well-studied attacks against a fingerprinting scheme including random
flipping attacks, correlation-based flipping attacks, and collusions among
multiple parties, which makes it hard for the attackers to infer the
fingerprint codes and avoid accusation. Via experiments on two real-life
location datasets and two synthetic ones, we show that our scheme achieves high
fingerprinting robustness and outperforms existing approaches. Besides, the
proposed fingerprinting scheme increases data utility for
differentially-private datasets, which is beneficial for data analyzers.

fake news always has been a problem for many years, but after the evolution of
social networks and increasing speed of news dissemination in recent years has
been considered again. There are several approaches to solving this problem,
one of which is to detect fake news based on its text style using deep neural
networks. In recent years, one of the most used forms of deep neural networks
for natural language processing is transfer learning with transformers. BERT is
one of the most promising transformers who outperforms other models in many NLP
benchmarks. This article, we introduce MWPBert, which uses two parallel BERT
networks to perform veracity detection on full-text news articles. One of the
BERT networks encodes news headline, and another encodes news body. Since the
input length of the BERT network is limited and constant and the news body is
usually a long text, we cannot fed the whole news text into the BERT.
Therefore, using the MaxWorth algorithm, we selected the part of the news text
that is more valuable for fact-checking, and fed it into the BERT network.
Finally, we encode the output of the two BERT networks to an output network to
classify the news. The experiment results showed that the proposed model
outperformed previous models in terms of accuracy and other performance

metaverse. To guarantee a robust connection between these two worlds, DTs
should maintain accurate representations of the physical applications, while
preserving synchronization between real and digital entities. In this paper, a
novel edge continual learning framework is proposed to accurately model the
evolving affinity between a physical twin (PT) and its corresponding cyber twin
(CT) while maintaining their utmost synchronization. In particular, a CT is
simulated as a deep neural network (DNN) at the wireless network edge to model
an autonomous vehicle traversing an episodically dynamic environment. As the
vehicular PT updates its driving policy in each episode, the CT is required to
concurrently adapt its DNN model to the PT, which gives rise to a
de-synchronization gap. Considering the history-aware nature of DTs, the model
update process is posed a dual objective optimization problem whose goal is to
jointly minimize the loss function over all encountered episodes and the
corresponding de-synchronization time. As the de-synchronization time continues
to increase over sequential episodes, an elastic weight consolidation (EWC)
technique that regularizes the DT history is proposed to limit
de-synchronization time. Furthermore, to address the plasticity-stability
tradeoff accompanying the progressive growth of the EWC regularization terms, a
modified EWC method that considers fair execution between the historical
episodes of the DTs is adopted. Ultimately, the proposed framework achieves a
simultaneously accurate and synchronous CT model that is robust to catastrophic
forgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve an
accuracy of 90 % while guaranteeing a minimal desynchronization time.

previous methods deeply couple the existing action models and need to retrain

actions that include heavy Pauli-Villars (PV) type bosons. This modification
does not affect the infrared dynamics but greatly reduces the ultraviolet

previously possible. I consider two different PV actions and find that both
show an apparent continuous phase transition in the 8-flavor system.
  I investigate the critical behavior using finite size scaling of the
renormalized gradient flow coupling. The finite size scaling curve-collapse
analysis predicts a first order phase transition consistent with discontinuity
exponent $\nu=1/4$ in the system without PV bosons. The scaling analysis with
the PV boson actions is not consistent with a first order phase transition. The
numerical data are well described by ""walking scaling"" corresponding to a
renormalization group $\beta$ function that just touches zero, $\beta(g^2) \sim

by Tsai et al. [1] and Luna et al. [2], in a digital receiver it is possible to
treat the TI-ADC errors as part of the communication channel and take advantage
of the adaptive equalizer to compensate them. Therefore calibration becomes an
integral part of the channel equalization. No special purpose analog or digital
calibration blocks or algorithms are required. However, there is a large class
of receivers where the equalization technique cannot be directly applied
because other signal processing blocks are located between the TI-ADC and the
equalizer. The technique presented here generalizes earlier works to this class
of receivers. The error backpropagation algorithm, traditionally used in
machine learning, is applied to the error computed at the receiver slicer and
used to adapt an auxiliary equalizer adjacent to the TI-ADC, called the
Compensation Equalizer (CE). Simulations using a dual polarization optical

approach combines and generalizes the unbiased MCMC and Multilevel Monte Carlo

can be implemented on parallel processors. We show that our estimator has a
finite variance and computational complexity and can achieve
$\varepsilon$-accuracy within the optimal $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ computational
cost under mild conditions. Our numerical experiments confirm our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the benefits of unbiased estimators in the massively

considered in probability theory. Since Athreya and Ney (1972) showed the
almost sure convergence of urn proportions in a randomized urn model with
irreducible replacement matrix under the $L\log L$ moment assumption, this
assumption has been regarded as the weakest moment assumption, but the
necessary has never been shown. In this paper, we study the strong and weak
convergence of generalized Friedman urns. It is proved that, when the random
replacement matrix is irreducible in probability, the sufficient and necessary
moment assumption for the almost sure convergence of the urn proportions is
that the expectation of the replacement matrix is finite, which is less
stringent than the $L\log L$ moment assumption, and when the replacement is
reducible, the $L\log L$ moment assumption is the weakest sufficient condition.
The rate of convergence and the strong and weak convergence of non-homogenous
generalized Friedman urns are also derived.

success in many natural language generation tasks. However, there has been
relatively less work on analyzing their ability to generate structured outputs
such as graphs. Unlike natural language, graphs have distinct structural and
semantic properties in the context of a downstream NLP task, e.g., generating a
graph that is connected and acyclic can be attributed to its structural
constraints, while the semantics of a graph can refer to how meaningfully an
edge represents the relation between two node concepts. In this work, we study
pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end
manner and analyze their ability to learn the structural constraints and
semantics of such graphs. We first show that with limited supervision,
pre-trained language models often generate graphs that either violate these
constraints or are semantically incoherent. Since curating large amount of
human-annotated graphs is expensive and tedious, we propose simple yet
effective ways of graph perturbations via node and edge edit operations that
lead to structurally and semantically positive and negative graphs. Next, we
leverage these graphs in different contrastive learning models with Max-Margin
and InfoNCE losses. Our methods lead to significant improvements in both
structural and semantic accuracy of explanation graphs and also generalize to
other similar graph generation tasks. Lastly, we show that human errors are the
best negatives for contrastive learning and also that automatically generating
more such human-like negative graphs can lead to further improvements. Our code

a popular tool for understanding the growth of galaxies and its connection with
the quenching of star formation. The emerging picture suggests that building a
central dense core is a necessary condition for quenching. However, it is not
clear whether changes in $\Sigma_{1}$ trace changes in stellar kinematics and
the growth of dispersion-dominated bulges. In this paper, we combine imaging
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with stellar kinematics from the Sydney-AAO
Multi-object Integral-field unit (SAMI) and Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache
Point Observatory (MaNGA) surveys to quantify the correlation between
$\Sigma_{1}$ and the proxy for stellar spin parameter within one effective
radius ($\lambda_{re}$) for 1599 nearby galaxies. We show that, on the
star-forming main sequence and at fixed stellar mass, changes in $\Sigma_{1}$
are mirrored by changes in $\lambda_{re}$. While forming stars, main sequence
galaxies remain rotationally-dominated systems, with their $\Sigma_{1}$
increasing but their stellar spin staying either constant or slightly
increasing. The picture changes below the main sequence, where $\Sigma_{1}$ and
$\lambda_{re}$ are no longer correlated. Passive systems show a narrower range
of $\Sigma_{1}$, but a wider range of $\lambda_{re}$ compared to star-forming
galaxies. Our results indicate that, from a structural point of view, passive
galaxies are a more heterogeneous population than star-forming systems, and may
have followed a variety of evolutionary paths. This also suggests that, if
dispersion-dominated bulges still grow significantly at $z\sim$0, this
generally takes place during, or after, the quenching phase.

zero, thus halting evolution. To make self-adaptive MR robust, this paper
introduces the Group Elite Selection of Mutation Rates (GESMR) algorithm. GESMR
co-evolves a population of solutions and a population of MRs, such that each MR
is assigned to a group of solutions. The resulting best mutational change in
the group, instead of average mutational change, is used for MR selection
during evolution, thus avoiding the vanishing MR problem. With the same number
of function evaluations and with almost no overhead, GESMR converges faster and
to better solutions than previous approaches on a wide range of continuous test
optimization problems. GESMR also scales well to high-dimensional
neuroevolution for supervised image-classification tasks and for reinforcement
learning control tasks. Remarkably, GESMR produces MRs that are optimal in the
long-term, as demonstrated through a comprehensive look-ahead grid search.
Thus, GESMR and its theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate how
self-adaptation can be harnessed to improve performance in several applications
of evolutionary computation.

of accurate data is available. Those data often come from a high-fidelity
model, which is computationally expensive. By combining the realizations of the
high-fidelity model with one or more low-fidelity models, the multi-fidelity
method can make accurate predictions of quantities of interest. This paper
proposes a new dimension reduction framework based on rotated multi-fidelity
Gaussian process regression and a Bayesian active learning scheme when the
available precise observations are insufficient. By drawing samples from the
trained rotated multi-fidelity model, the so-called supervised dimension
reduction problems can be solved following the idea of the sliced average
variance estimation (SAVE) method combined with a Gaussian process regression
dimension reduction technique. This general framework we develop can
effectively solve high-dimensional problems while the data are insufficient for
applying traditional dimension reduction methods. Moreover, a more accurate
surrogate Gaussian process model of the original problem can be obtained based
on our trained model. The effectiveness of the proposed rotated multi-fidelity
Gaussian process(RMFGP) model is demonstrated in four numerical examples. The
results show that our method has better performance in all cases and

the photohadronic model is very successful in explaining the VHE gamma-ray

to observe the VHE gamma-ray spectra from nearby GRBs in their afterglow
phases, then some of them could only be explained by employing two different
spectral indices. If confirmed, such VHE spectra could be interpreted as a
result of the interactions of the high energy protons with the photons, both

geometric conditions. On the boundaries of the cavities we impose either the
Dirichlet or a nonlinear Robin condition; the choice of the type of the

optimal latency and power tradeoffs for configurable computer systems. Instead
of randomly sampling from the configuration space, SEML reduces the search cost
by dramatically reducing the number of configurations that must be sampled to
optimize system goals (e.g., low latency or energy). Nevertheless, SEML only
reduces one component of cost -- the total number of samples collected -- but
does not decrease the cost of collecting each sample. Critically, not all
samples are equal; some take much longer to collect because they correspond to
slow system configurations. This paper present Cello, a computer systems
optimization framework that reduces sample collection costs -- especially those
that come from the slowest configurations. The key insight is to predict ahead
of time whether samples will have poor system behavior (e.g., long latency or
high energy) and terminate these samples early before their measured system
behavior surpasses the termination threshold, which we call it predictive early
termination. To predict the future system behavior accurately before it
manifests as high runtime or energy, Cello uses censored regression to produces
accurate predictions for running samples. We evaluate Cello by optimizing
latency and energy for Apache Spark workloads. We give Cello a fixed amount of
time to search a combined space of hardware and software configuration
parameters. Our evaluation shows that compared to the state-of-the-art SEML
approach in computer systems optimization, Cello improves latency by 1.19X for
minimizing latency under a power constraint, and improves energy by 1.18X for
minimizing energy under a latency constraint.

essential task, which aims to retrieve a set of person images over visible and
infrared camera views. In order to mitigate the impact of large modality
discrepancy existing in heterogeneous images, previous methods attempt to apply
generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate the modality-consisitent data.
However, due to severe color variations between the visible domain and infrared
domain, the generated fake cross-modality samples often fail to possess good
qualities to fill the modality gap between synthesized scenarios and target
real ones, which leads to sub-optimal feature representations. In this work, we
address cross-modality matching problem with Aligned Grayscale Modality (AGM),
an unified dark-line spectrum that reformulates visible-infrared dual-mode
learning as a gray-gray single-mode learning problem. Specifically, we generate
the grasycale modality from the homogeneous visible images. Then, we train a
style tranfer model to transfer infrared images into homogeneous grayscale
images. In this way, the modality discrepancy is significantly reduced in the
image space. In order to reduce the remaining appearance discrepancy, we
further introduce a multi-granularity feature extraction network to conduct
feature-level alignment. Rather than relying on the global information, we
propose to exploit local (head-shoulder) features to assist person Re-ID, which
complements each other to form a stronger feature descriptor. Comprehensive
experiments implemented on the mainstream evaluation datasets include SYSU-MM01
and RegDB indicate that our method can significantly boost cross-modality
retrieval performance against the state of the art methods.

units) of $0.30\pm0.09$ and $0.11\pm0.04$ and metallicity gradients of
$-0.37\pm0.13$ dex/$R_{25}$ and $-0.36\pm0.16$ dex/$R_{25}$ are measured for M
31 and M 33, respectively. For M 33 the 2-dimensional distribution of
metallicity indicates a deviation from azimutal symmetry with an off-centre
peak. The flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relationship of blue supergiant
stars is used to determine a distance modulus of 24.51$\pm$0.13 mag for M 31

physical properties and applications ranging from nanoelectronics to sensing
and photonics. In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material,
monolayers of other layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides
MoS2 or WSe2 are gaining in importance as promising channel materials for
field-effect transistors (FETs) and phototransistors. However, it is unclear
that how the specific process of electron transport is affected by temperature.
So, nowadays the electron dynamics of single-layer semiconductor cannot be
understood fundamentally. Here, we develop an analytical theory distinguishing
from traditional energy band theory, backed up by Monte-Carlo simulations, that
predicts the process of electron transport and the effect of temperature on the
electron transport in the single-layer semiconductor. In this paper, A new
model is built to deal with electron transporting in the sing-layer
semiconductor. The resistance is decided by the barrier rather than the
electron scattering in the single-layer semiconductor, which is macroscopic
quantum effect. Electron transport in FETs with different dielectric
configurations are investigated at different temperatures and a new control
factor that is decided by top-gate voltage or bottom-gate voltage is introduced
to describe the effect of gate voltage on the electron transport in 2D
semiconductor. The results of simulation show the drain current is mainly
determined by some elements, such as temperature, top-gate voltage, bottom-gate
voltage and source-drain voltage.

We aim to recover the MFG model parameters that govern the underlying

severe ill-posedness, obtaining a good quality reconstruction is very
difficult. Nonetheless, it is vital to recover the model parameters stably and
efficiently in order to uncover the underlying causes for population dynamics
for practical needs.
  Our work focuses on the simultaneous recovery of running cost and interaction
energy in the MFG equations from a \emph{finite number of boundary
measurements} of population profile and boundary movement. To achieve this
goal, we formalize the inverse problem as a constrained optimization problem of
a least squares residual functional under suitable norms. We then develop a
fast and robust operator splitting algorithm to solve the optimization using
techniques including harmonic extensions, three-operator splitting scheme, and
primal-dual hybrid gradient method. Numerical experiments illustrate the

limiting cases of the theory, corresponding to the drift and diffusive part of
the energy flux, respectively. We find that due to the presence of quadratic
flexural phonons the drifting second sound does not exist in the thermodynamic
limit, while the driftless mode is less affected. This is understood as a
result of infinite effective inertia of flexual phonons, due to their constant
density states and divergent Bose-Einstein distribution in the long wave length
limit. Consequently, the group velocity of the drifting mode is smaller than
that of the driftless mode. However, upon tensile strain, the velocity of
drifting mode becomes larger. Both of them increase with tensile strain due to
the linearization of the flexural phonon dispersion. Our results clarify
several puzzles encountered previously and pave the way for exploring wave-like
heat transport beyond hydrodynamic regime.

  Population Dynamics","Published at ICLR 2023 (notable top 25%)",,,,"cs.LG q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Population dynamics is the study of temporal and spatial variation in the
size of populations of organisms and is a major part of population ecology. One
of the main difficulties in analyzing population dynamics is that we can only
obtain observation data with coarse time intervals from fixed-point
observations due to experimental costs or measurement constraints. Recently,
modeling population dynamics by using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and
dynamic optimal transport has been proposed to infer the sample trajectories
from a fixed-point observed population. While the sample behavior in CNFs is
deterministic, the actual sample in biological systems moves in an essentially
random yet directional manner. Moreover, when a sample moves from point A to
point B in dynamical systems, its trajectory typically follows the principle of
least action in which the corresponding action has the smallest possible value.
To satisfy these requirements of the sample trajectories, we formulate the
Lagrangian Schr\""odinger bridge (LSB) problem and propose to solve it
approximately by modeling the advection-diffusion process with regularized
neural SDE. We also develop a model architecture that enables faster
computation of the loss function. Experimental results show that the proposed
method can efficiently approximate the population-level dynamics even for
high-dimensional data and that using the prior knowledge introduced by the
Lagrangian enables us to estimate the sample-level dynamics with stochastic
behavior.

fixed version of a function. In multiclass classification task, CompDefect
categorizes the type of defect via multiclass classification with the

its characteristics using our own Earth. We estimate photon fluxes from such a

Einstein ring around the Sun, seen through the solar corona. The solar corona
background contributes a significant amount of stochastic noise and represents
the main noise source for observations utilizing the SGL. We estimate the

and the room layout (e.g., room elements such as floor and walls), our
architecture generates a collection of objects (e.g., furniture items such as
sofa, table and chairs) that is consistent with the room type and layout. This
is a challenging problem because the generated scene should satisfy multiple
constrains, e.g., each object must lie inside the room and two objects cannot
occupy the same volume. To address these challenges, we propose a deep
generative model that encodes these relationships as soft constraints on an
attributed graph (e.g., the nodes capture attributes of room and furniture
elements, such as class, pose and size, and the edges capture geometric
relationships such as relative orientation). The architecture consists of a
graph encoder that maps the input graph to a structured latent space, and a
graph decoder that generates a furniture graph, given a latent code and the
room graph. The latent space is modeled with auto-regressive priors, which
facilitates the generation of highly structured scenes. We also propose an
efficient training procedure that combines matching and constrained learning.

that the independence polynomial $Z_G(\lambda)$ of a graph $G$ of maximum
degree at most $d+1$ does not vanish provided that $\vert{\lambda}\vert \leq
\frac{d^d}{(d+1)^{d+1}}$. Significant extensions of this result have recently
been given in the case $\Re \lambda \geq 0$ by Peters and Regts (2019) and
Bencs and Csikv\'ari (arxiv:1807.08963). In this paper, our motivation is to
further extend these results and find zero free regions when $\Re \lambda \leq
0$.
  We begin by giving new geometric criteria for establishing zero-free regions
as well as for carrying out semi-rigorous numerical explorations. We then
provide two examples of the (rigorous) use of these criteria, by establishing
two new zero-free regions in the left-half plane. We also improve upon the
results of Bencs and Csikv\'ari (arxiv:1807.08963) for the right half-plane
using our framework. By a direct application of the interpolation method of
Barvinok, combined with extensions due to Patel and Regts, these results also
imply deterministic polynomial time approximation algorithms for the
independence polynomial of bounded degree graphs in the new zero-free regions.

self-supervised learning approach for graph-structured data. Despite its
remarkable success, existing GCL methods highly rely on an augmentation scheme
to learn the representations invariant across different augmentation views. In
this work, we revisit such a convention in GCL through examining the effect of
augmentation techniques on graph data via the lens of spectral theory. We found
that graph augmentations preserve the low-frequency components and perturb the
middle-and high-frequency components of the graph, which contributes to the
success of GCL algorithms on homophilic graphs but hinder its application on
heterophilic graphs, due to the high-frequency preference of heterophilic data.
Motivated by this, we propose a novel, theoretically-principled, and
augmentation-free GCL method, named AF-GCL, that (1) leverages the features
aggregated by Graph Neural Network to construct the self-supervision signal
instead of augmentations and therefore (2) is less sensitive to the graph
homophily degree. Theoretically, We present the performance guarantee for
AF-GCL as well as an analysis for understanding the efficacy of AF-GCL.
Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets with varying degrees of
heterophily show that AF-GCL presents competitive or better performance on

propose to treat RNN as dynamical systems and to correlate hyperparameters with
accuracy through Lyapunov spectral analysis, a methodology specifically
designed for nonlinear dynamical systems. To address the fact that RNN features
go beyond the existing Lyapunov spectral analysis, we propose to infer relevant
features from the Lyapunov spectrum with an Autoencoder and an embedding of its
latent representation (AeLLE). Our studies of various RNN architectures show
that AeLLE successfully correlates RNN Lyapunov spectrum with accuracy.
Furthermore, the latent representation learned by AeLLE is generalizable to
novel inputs from the same task and is formed early in the process of RNN
training. The latter property allows for the prediction of the accuracy to
which RNN would converge when training is complete. We conclude that
representation of RNN through Lyapunov spectrum along with AeLLE, and assists
with hyperparameter selection of RNN, provides a novel method for organization
and interpretation of variants of RNN architectures.

medium composed of two species, baryonic (bright) and dark matter particles,
using a hybrid quantum-classical fluid approach. Baryonic matter is treated
classically, which is appropriate for most astrophysical environments, e.g.,
Bok globules, while dark matter is treated through a quantum hydrodynamic
approach allowing for possible nonlinearities. These nonlinearities may arise
in bosonic dark matter due to attractive or repulsive short-range
self-interaction (attractive interaction being more relevant for axions) or
from the Pauli exclusion principle for fermionic dark matter, e.g., massive
neutrinos. This allows us to explore, in a very broad context, the impact of a
dark matter background on the Jeans process for different scenarios discussed
in the literature. In the simplest case, it is shown that the effect of a dark
matter background on the Jeans mass depends only on the ratio of densities and
velocity dispersions of baryonic and dark matter particles. Taking advantage of
that, we confront the established stability criterion with Bok globule
stability observations and show that the model adequately accounts for the data
with dark matter parameters close to those predicted independently from
numerical simulations.

calculations of the static electrical response tensors of the H2 molecule to
construct the perturbed rovibrational eigensystem and its ground state
absorptions. We restrict attention to two simple field configurations that are
relevant to condensed hydrogen molecules in the interstellar medium: a uniform
electric field, and the field of a point-like charge. The energy eigenstates
are mixtures of vibrational and angular momentum eigenstates so there are many
transitions that satisfy the dipole selection rules. We find that mixing is
strongest amongst the states with high vibrational excitation, leading to
hundreds of absorption lines across the optical and near infrared. These
spectra are very different to that of the field-free molecule, so if they
appeared in astronomical data they would be difficult to assign. Furthermore in
a condensed environment the excited states likely have short lifetimes to
internal conversion, giving the absorption lines a diffuse appearance. We
therefore suggest electrified H2 as a possible carrier of the Diffuse
Interstellar Bands (DIBs). We further argue that in principle it may be
possible to account for all of the DIBs with this one carrier. However, despite
electrification the transitions are not very strong and a large column of
condensed H2 would be required, making it difficult to reconcile this
possibility with our current understanding of the ISM.

($H_1$). Dark Higgs boson plays a crucial role in DM phenomenology, not only
for generation of dark photon mass, but also opening new channels for DM pair
annihilations into the final states involving dark Higgs boson, such as dark
Higgs pair as well as $Z' Z'$ through dark Higgs exchange in the $s$-channel,
and co-annihilation into $Z' H_1$ in case of inelastic DM. Thus dark Higgs
boson will dissect the strong correlation $M_{Z'} \sim 2 M_{\rm DM}$, and much
wider mass range is allowed for $U(1)_X$-charged complex scalar and Dirac
fermion DM, still explaining the muon $(g-2)$. We consider both generic
$U(1)_X$ breaking as well as ${\rm U(1)}_X \rightarrow Z_2$ (and also into
$Z_3$ only for scalar DM case).

  Semantic Segmentation and Object Localization","IEEE TPAMI, 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Obtaining accurate pixel-level localization from class labels is a crucial
process in weakly supervised semantic segmentation and object localization.
Attribution maps from a trained classifier are widely used to provide
pixel-level localization, but their focus tends to be restricted to a small
discriminative region of the target object. An AdvCAM is an attribution map of
an image that is manipulated to increase the classification score produced by a
classifier before the final softmax or sigmoid layer. This manipulation is
realized in an anti-adversarial manner, so that the original image is perturbed
along pixel gradients in directions opposite to those used in an adversarial
attack. This process enhances non-discriminative yet class-relevant features,
which make an insufficient contribution to previous attribution maps, so that
the resulting AdvCAM identifies more regions of the target object. In addition,
we introduce a new regularization procedure that inhibits the incorrect
attribution of regions unrelated to the target object and the excessive
concentration of attributions on a small region of the target object. Our
method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in weakly and
semi-supervised semantic segmentation, on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO
2014 datasets. In weakly supervised object localization, it achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance on the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets.

quality first. In this paper, we consider AR technology as the superimposition
of virtual scenes and real scenes, and introduce visual confusion as its basic
theory. A more general problem is first proposed, which is evaluating the
perceptual quality of superimposed images, i.e., confusing image quality
assessment. A ConFusing Image Quality Assessment (CFIQA) database is
established, which includes 600 reference images and 300 distorted images
generated by mixing reference images in pairs. Then a subjective quality
perception study and an objective model evaluation experiment are conducted
towards attaining a better understanding of how humans perceive the confusing

the confusing image quality. Moreover, an extended ARIQA study is further
conducted based on the CFIQA study. We establish an ARIQA database to better
simulate the real AR application scenarios, which contains 20 AR reference
images, 20 background (BG) reference images, and 560 distorted images generated
from AR and BG references, as well as the correspondingly collected subjective

DNN modules to improve prediction accuracy. Traditional CPU-based recommender
systems cannot meet these two trends, and GPU- centric training has become a
trending approach. However, we observe that GPU devices in training recommender
systems are underutilized, and they cannot attain an expected throughput
improvement as what it has achieved in CV and NLP areas. This issue can be
explained by two characteristics of these recommendation models: First, they
contain up to a thousand input feature fields, introducing fragmentary and
memory-intensive operations; Second, the multiple constituent feature
interaction submodules introduce substantial small-sized compute kernels. To
remove this roadblock to the development of recommender systems, we propose a

models on commodity hardware. Specifically, we conduct a systematic analysis to
reveal the bottlenecks encountered in training recommendation models. We
leverage the model structure and data distribution to unleash the potential of
hardware through our packing, interleaving, and caching optimization.
Experiments show that PICASSO increases the hardware utilization by an order of
magnitude on the basis of SOTA baselines and brings up to 6x throughput
improvement for a variety of industrial recommendation models. Using the same

$, is proportional to $ \Theta^\phi_{n}(A, \cdot)$. If $ k = n-1 $ the
conclusion holds for all sets of positive reach with finite and positive
volume. We also prove a related sharp result about the removability of the
singularities. This result is based on the extension of the notion of a normal
boundary point, originally introduced by Busemann and Feller (1936) for
arbitrary convex bodies, to sets of positive reach.
  These results are new even in the Euclidean space.
  Several auxiliary and related results are also proved, which are of
independent interest. They include the extension of the classical Steiner--Weyl
tube formula to arbitrary closed sets in a finite dimensional uniformly convex
normed vector space and a general formula for the derivative of the localized
volume function, which extends and complements recent results of
Chambolle--Lussardi--Villa (2021).

traffic throughput and safety at road intersections, single-track lanes, and
construction zones. However, multiple CAVs can block each other and create a
mutual deadlock around these road segments (i) when vehicle systems have a
failure, such as a communication failure, control failure, or localization
failure and/or (ii) when vehicles use a long shared road segment. In this
paper, we present an Autonomous Deadlock Detection and Recovery Protocol at
Intersections for Automated Vehicles named A-DRIVE that is a decentralized and
time-sensitive technique to improve traffic throughput and shorten worst-case
recovery time. To enable the deadlock recovery with automated vehicles and with
human-driven vehicles, A-DRIVE includes two components: V2V communication-based
A-DRIVE and Local perception-based A-DRIVE. V2V communication-based A-DRIVE is
designed for homogeneous traffic environments in which all the vehicles are
connected and automated. Local perception-based A-DRIVE is for mixed traffic,
where CAVs, non-connected automated vehicles, and human-driven vehicles
co-exist and cooperate with one another. Since these two components are not
exclusive, CAVs inclusively and seamlessly use them in practice. Finally, our
simulation results show that A-DRIVE improves traffic throughput compared to a
baseline protocol.

a relevant object while recognizing their interaction, is crucial for
understanding a still image. Recently, transformer-based models have
significantly advanced the progress of HOI detection. However, the capability
of these models has not been fully explored since the Object Query of the model
is always simply initialized as just zeros, which would affect the performance.
In this paper, we try to study the issue of promoting transformer-based HOI
detectors by initializing the Object Query with category-aware semantic
information. To this end, we innovatively propose the Category-Aware
Transformer Network (CATN). Specifically, the Object Query would be initialized
via category priors represented by an external object detection model to yield
better performance. Moreover, such category priors can be further used for
enhancing the representation ability of features via the attention mechanism.
We have firstly verified our idea via the Oracle experiment by initializing the
Object Query with the groundtruth category information. And then extensive
experiments have been conducted to show that a HOI detection model equipped
with our idea outperforms the baseline by a large margin to achieve a new
state-of-the-art result.

ill-conditioned problem due to the inherent 2D-3D depth ambiguity, inter-person
occlusions, and body truncations. To tackle these issues, recent works have
shown promising results by simultaneously reasoning for different people.
However, in most cases this is done by only considering pairwise person
interactions, hindering thus a holistic scene representation able to capture
long-range interactions. This is addressed by approaches that jointly process
all people in the scene, although they require defining one of the individuals
as a reference and a pre-defined person ordering, being sensitive to this
choice. In this paper, we overcome both these limitations, and we propose an
approach for multi-person 3D pose estimation that captures long-range
interactions independently of the input order. For this purpose, we build a
residual-like permutation-invariant network that successfully refines
potentially corrupted initial 3D poses estimated by an off-the-shelf detector.
The residual function is learned via Set Transformer blocks, that model the
interactions among all initial poses, no matter their ordering or number. A
thorough evaluation demonstrates that our approach is able to boost the
performance of the initially estimated 3D poses by large margins, achieving
state-of-the-art results on standardized benchmarks. Additionally, the proposed
module works in a computationally efficient manner and can be potentially used
as a drop-in complement for any 3D pose detector in multi-people scenes.

existing works are based on power flow equations, which require accurate
network parameters that may be unobservable in many distribution systems. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a learning-based surrogate model for
JCC-OPF with renewable generation. This model equivalently converts joint
chance constraints in quantile-based forms and introduces deep quantile
regression to replicate them, in which a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is
trained with a special loss function to predict the quantile of constraint
violations. Another MLP is trained to predict the expected power loss. Then,
the JCC-OPF can be formulated without network parameters by reformulating these
two MLPs into mixed-integer linear constraints. To further improve its
performance, two pre-processing steps, i.e., data augmentation and calibration,
are developed. The former trains a simulator to generate more training samples
for enhancing the prediction accuracy of MLPs. The latter designs a positive
parameter to calibrate the predictions of MLPs so that the feasibility of
solutions can be guaranteed. Numerical experiments based on the IEEE 33- and
123-bus systems validate that the proposed model can achieve desirable
feasibility and optimality simultaneously with no need for network parameters.

dimensionality reduces, known as exceptional points (EPs), demonstrates
distinguishing behavior from the Hermitian counterpart. Here, we present an
analytical description of local density of states (LDOS) for microcavity
featuring chiral EPs, and unveil the anomalous spontaneous emission dynamics
from a quantum emitter (QE) due to the non-Lorentzian response of EPs.
Specifically, we reveal that a square Lorentzian term of LDOS contributed by
chiral EPs can destructively interfere with the linear Lorentzian profile,
resulting in the null Purcell enhancement to a QE with special transition
frequency, which we call {\it{EP induced transparency}}. While for the case of
constructive interference, the square Lorentzian term can narrow the linewidth
of Rabi splitting even below that of bare components, and thus significantly
suppresses the decay of Rabi oscillation. Interestingly, we further find that
an open microcavity with chiral EPs supports atom-photon bound states for
population trapping and decay suppression in long-time dynamics. As
applications, we demonstrate the advantages of microcavity operated at chiral
EPs in achieving high-fidelity entanglement generation and high-efficiency
single-photon generation. Our work unveils the exotic cavity quantum
electrodynamics unique to chiral EPs, which opens the door for controlling
light-matter interaction at the quantum level through non-Hermiticity, and
holds great potential in building high-performance quantum-optics devices.

adaptive distance threshold (instead of a fixed threshold) is employed for loop
closure detection, which achieves more accurate loop closure detection results.
Besides, a feature-based matching method is used in our approach to compute
vehicle pose transformations between loop closure point cloud pairs, instead of
using the raw point cloud obtained by the LiDAR sensor, which significantly
reduces the computation time. The KITTI dataset is used for verifications of
our method, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms typical LiDAR odometry/SLAM methods in the literature. Our code is

about the misclassification of instances with similar spatial structures. In
this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network DGFA-Net rooted in dilated
graph feature aggregation (DGFA), guided by multi-basis aggregation loss
(MALoss) calculated through Pyramid Decoders. To configure multi-receptive
field features, DGFA which takes the proposed dilated graph convolution
(DGConv) as its basic building block, is designed to aggregate multi-scale
feature representation by capturing dilated graphs with various receptive
regions. By simultaneously considering penalizing the receptive field
information with point sets of different resolutions as calculation bases, we
introduce Pyramid Decoders driven by MALoss for the diversity of receptive
field bases. Combining these two aspects, DGFA-Net significantly improves the
segmentation performance of instances with similar spatial structures.
Experiments on S3DIS, ShapeNetPart and Toronto-3D show that DGFA-Net
outperforms the baseline approach, achieving a new state-of-the-art
segmentation performance.

the system is given as the sum of a Cahn-Hilliard term and an elastic
polyconvex term, with a coupling between the phase field variable and the
elastic deformation gradient in the elastic contribution. General constitutive
assumptions complying with a mechanical version of the second law of
thermodynamics in isothermal situations are taken. We study the global
existence of a weak solution for a simplified and regularized version of the
general model, which considers an incompressible elastic free energy of
Neo-Hookean type with elastic coefficients depending on the phase field
variable. The regularization is properly designed to deal with the coupling
between the phase field variable and the elastic deformation gradient in the
elastic energy density. The analysis is made both in two and three space
dimensions.

However, they neglect that it is challenging-yet-unnecessary to construct a

a combination of indicators including counterparts offset, parallax

identified 40 per cent of the variables with stars, 10 per cent with accreting

the variables are identified as galaxies. It is found that the mean effective
temperatures of the highly variable stars are lower than those of less variable
stars. Our sample of highly variable AGN tend to have lower black hole masses,
redshifts, and marginally lower soft X-ray luminosities compared to the less

list. Recently there is a trend in e-commerce that the recommended items are
organized as two-dimensional grid-based panels where users can view the items
in both vertical and horizontal directions. Presenting items in grid-based
result panels poses new challenges to recommender systems because existing
models are all designed to output sequential lists while the slots in a
grid-based panel have no explicit order. Directly converting the item rankings
into grids (e.g., pre-defining an order on the slots)overlooks the
user-specific behavioral patterns on grid-based pan-els and inevitably hurts
the user experiences. To address this issue, we propose a novel Markov decision
process (MDP) to place the items in 2D grid-based result panels at the final
re-ranking stage of the recommender systems. The model, referred to as
Panel-MDP, takes an initial item ranking from the early stages as the input.
Then, it defines the MDP discrete time steps as the ranks in the initial
ranking list, and the actions as the slots in the grid-based panels, plus a
NULL action. At each time step, Panel-MDP sequentially takes an action of
selecting one slot for placing an item of the initial ranking list, or
discarding the item if NULL action is selected. The process is continued until
all of the slots are filled. The reinforcement learning algorithm of DQN is
employed to implement and learn the parameters in the Panel-MDP. Experiments on
a dataset collected from a widely-used e-commerce app demonstrated the
superiority ofPanel-MDP in terms of recommending 2D grid-based result panels.

design end-to-end models based on information propagation schemes. However,
existing propagation-based methods fail to (1) model the underlying
hierarchical structures and relations, and (2) capture the high-order
collaborative signals of items for learning high-quality user and item
representations.
  In this paper, we propose a new model, called Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Gated
Network (HAKG), to tackle the aforementioned problems. Technically, we model
users and items (that are captured by a user-item graph), as well as entities
and relations (that are captured in a KG) in hyperbolic space, and design a
hyperbolic aggregation scheme to gather relational contexts over KG. Meanwhile,
we introduce a novel angle constraint to preserve characteristics of items in
the embedding space. Furthermore, we propose a dual item embeddings design to
represent and propagate collaborative signals and knowledge associations
separately, and leverage the gated aggregation to distill discriminative
information for better capturing user behavior patterns. Experimental results
on three benchmark datasets show that, HAKG achieves significant improvement
over the state-of-the-art methods like CKAN, Hyper-Know, and KGIN. Further
analyses on the learned hyperbolic embeddings confirm that HAKG offers
meaningful insights into the hierarchies of data.

is given, each edge/arc assigned two weights. Let us call them ""cost"" and
""length"" for definiteness. Finding a min-cost upper-bounded length path between
a given pair of vertices is required. The problem is NP-hard even when the
lengths of all edges are the same. Therefore, various approximation algorithms
have been proposed in the literature for it. The constraint on path length can
be accounted for by considering one edge weight equals to a linear combination
of cost and length. By varying the multiplier value in a linear combination, a
feasible solution delivers a minimum to the function with new weights. At the
same time, Dijkstra's algorithm or its modifications are used to construct the
shortest path with the current weights of the edges. However, with
insufficiently large graphs, this approach may turn out to be time-consuming.
In this article, we propose to look for a solution, not in the original graph
but specially constructed hierarchical structures (HS). We show that the
shortest path in the HS is constructed with $O(m)$-time complexity, where $m$
is the number of edges/arcs of the graph, and the approximate solution in the
case of integer costs and lengths of the edges is found with $O(m\log n)$-time
complexity. The a priori estimate of the algorithm's accuracy turned out to
depend on the parameters of the problem and can be significant. Therefore, to
evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness, we conducted a numerical experiment on
the graphs of roads of megalopolis and randomly constructed unit-disk graphs
(UDGs). The numerical experiment results show that in the HS, a solution close
to optimal one is built 10--100 times faster than in the methods which use
Dijkstra's algorithm to build a min-weight path in the original graph.

their applications. To address this limitation, we generalize the online

Specifically, the main idea of our generalized OFW is to perform an update
similar to the original OFW after receiving any delayed gradient, and play the
latest decision for each round. Moreover, the essential change on OSPF is to
replace the sum of queried gradients, which is originally utilized in each
update, with the sum of available gradients. Despite their simplicities, our
novel analysis shows that under a relatively large amount of delay, the
generalized OFW and OSPF enjoy the same regret bound as OFW and OSPF in the

singularity at $r=\infty$ with the topology of a 2-dimensional sphere. The
expansion scalar of geodesics reaching this singularity diverges in a finite

be taken into account. Following classical reinforcement learning, these
objectives have to be combined into a single reward function. In contrast,
multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) methods learn from vectors of
per-objective rewards instead. In the case of multi-policy MORL, sets of
decision policies for various preferences regarding the conflicting objectives
are optimized. This is especially important when target preferences are not
known during training or when preferences change dynamically during
application. While it is, in general, straightforward to extend a
single-objective reinforcement learning method for MORL based on linear
scalarization, solutions that are reachable by these methods are limited to
convex regions of the Pareto front. Non-linear MORL methods like Thresholded
Lexicographic Ordering (TLO) are designed to overcome this limitation.

the main statements of the Langlands classification and Arthur's conjectures
for real reductive groups as formulated by Adams, Barbasch, and Vogan. In the
second half, I will turn my attention to the Orbit Method, a conjectural scheme
for classifying irreducible unitary representations of a real reductive group.
I will give a definition of the Orbit Method in the case when the group is
complex. The main input is the theory of unipotent ideals and Harish-Chandra
bimodules, developed in arXiv:2108.03453. I will show that the Orbit Method I
define is related to Arthur's conjectures via a natural duality map. Finally, I
will sketch a possible generalization of this Orbit Method for arbitrary real
groups.

microswimmers in orbits, where the trapping time heavily depends on the swimmer
flow field and noise is needed to escape the trap. Here, we use experiments and
simulations to investigate the trapping of microrollers by obstacles.
Microrollers are rotating particles close to a bottom surface, which have a
prescribed propulsion direction imposed by an external rotating magnetic field.
The flow field that drives their motion is quite different from previously
studied swimmers. We found that the trapping time can be controlled by
modifying the obstacle size or the colloid-obstacle repulsive potential. We
detail the mechanisms of the trapping and find two remarkable features: The
microroller is confined in the wake of the obstacle, and it can only enter the
trap with Brownian motion. While noise is usually needed to escape traps in
dynamical systems, here, we show that it is the only means to reach the
hydrodynamic attractor.

traffic flow of automated vehicles (AVs) and human driven vehicles (HVs). The
leading vehicle moves with constant speed in the experiment. The following
vehicles consist of six developable AVs and different number of HVs. Thus, the
market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs decreases with the increase of platoon
size. The AVs are homogeneously distributed in the platoon. The constant time
gap car-following policy is adopted for the AVs and the gap is set to 1.5 s.
The experiment shows that in the 7-vehicle-platoon, the oscillations grow only
slightly. In the 10-vehicle-platoon, the AVs could still significantly suppress
the growth of oscillations. With the further decrease of MPR of AVs in the 13-
and 20-vehicle-platoon, the AVs become having no significant impact on
oscillation growth. On the other hand, with the decrease of MPR of AVs, average
density of the vehicles and flow rate of the platoon increase, which
demonstrates a trade-off between traffic stability and throughput under the
given setup of AVs. The simulation study is also carried out, which exhibits
good agreement with the experiment. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the
parameters in the AV upper-level control algorithm has been performed, which is
expected to guide future experiment design.

failure. Overheating causes irreversible damage to circuit components and can
also lead to fire, explosions, and injuries. Accordingly, in the advent of 2D
material-based electronics, an understanding of their thermal properties in
addition to their electric ones is crucial to enable efficient transfer of
excess heat away from the electronic components. In this work we propose
structures based on free-standing, few-layer, nanopatterned MoS2 that insulate
and guide heat in the in-plane direction. We arrive at these designs via a
thorough study of the in-plane thermal conductivity as a function of thickness,
porosity, and temperature in both pristine and nanopatterned MoS2 membranes.
Two-laser Raman thermometry was employed to measure the thermal conductivities
of a set of free-standing MoS2 flakes with diameters greater than 20 um and
thicknesses from 5 to 40 nm, resulting in values from 30 to 85 W/mK,
respectively. After nanopatterning a square lattice of 100-nm diameter holes
with a focused ion beam we have obtained a greater than 10-fold reduction of
the thermal conductivities for the period of 500 nm and values below 1 W/mK for
the period of 300 nm. The results were supported by equilibrium molecular
dynamic simulations for both pristine and nanopatterned MoS2. The selective
patterning of certain areas results in extremely large difference in thermal
conductivities within the same material. Exploitation of this effect enabled
for the first time thermal insulation and heat guiding in the few-layer MoS2.
The patterned regions act as high thermal resistors: we obtained a thermal
resistance of 4x10-6 m2K/W with only four patterned lattice periods of 300 nm,
highlighting the significant potential of MoS2 for thermal management
applications.

ferroelectrics do not belong in the topological universe because strong
anisotropy imposes insurmountable energy barriers for topological excitations.
Here we show that uniaxial ferroelectrics provide unique opportunity for the
formation of topological polarization networks comprising branching intertwined
domains with opposite counterflowing polarization. We report that they host the
topological state of matter: a crisscrossing structure of topologically
protected colliding head-to-head and tail-to-tail polarization domains, which
for decades has been considered impossible from the electrostatic viewpoint.
The domain wall interfacing the counterflowing domains is a multiconnected

Moreover, the growth in the halo population is not matched by a decrease of the

observations at distances greater than 0.3 au. We also find that the halo is
negligible at small heliocentric distances. The fractional strahl density

coefficients of B-spline functions of degree $m$ in the Bernstein-B\'{e}zier
form is derived. Its complexity is proportional to the number of coefficients
in the case of coincident boundary knots. This means that, asymptotically, the
algorithm is optimal. In other cases, the complexity is increased by at most
$O(m^3)$. When the Bernstein-B\'{e}zier coefficients of B-spline basis
functions are known, it is possible to compute any B-spline function in linear
time with respect to its degree by performing the geometric algorithm proposed
recently by the authors. This algorithm scales well when evaluating the
B-spline curve at multiple points, e.g., in order to render it, since one only
needs to find the coefficients for each knot span once. When evaluating many
B-spline curves at multiple points (as is the case when rendering tensor
product B-spline surfaces), such approach has lower computational complexity
than using the de Boor-Cox algorithm. The numerical tests show that the new
method is efficient. The problem of finding the coefficients of the B-spline
functions in the power basis can be solved similarly.

expressed in terms of the associated population risk. To derive bounds for the
performance of the estimator under covariate shift, however, pointwise
convergence rates are required. Under weak assumptions on the design
distribution, it is shown that the least squares estimator (LSE) over
$1$-Lipschitz functions is also minimax rate optimal with respect to a weighted
uniform norm, where the weighting accounts in a natural way for the
non-uniformity of the design distribution. This moreover implies that although
least squares is a global criterion, the LSE turns out to be locally adaptive.
We develop a new indirect proof technique that establishes the local
convergence behavior based on a carefully chosen local perturbation of the LSE.
These local rates are then used to construct a rate-optimal estimator for
transfer learning under covariate shift.

interior of the alveoli is covered with a ~ 1 micron thick lining fluid, called
pulmonary surfactant. Inhaled nanoparticles are susceptible to interact with
the lung fluid and modify pulmonary functions. Here we evaluate the structural
and rheological properties of the pulmonary surfactant substitute Curosurf
which is administered to premature babies for the treatment of respiratory
distress syndrome. Curosurf is considered a reliable model of endogenous
pulmonary surfactant in terms of composition, structure and function. Using
active microrheology based on magnetically actuated wires, we find that
Curosurf dispersions exhibit a Newtonian behavior at lipid concentration from 0
to 80 g L-1, and that the viscosity follows the Krieger-Dougherty law observed
for a wide variety of colloids. Upon addition of 40 nm alumina nanoplatelets, a
significant change of the Curosurf rheology is noticed. The dispersions then
enter a soft solid phase characterized by an infinite viscosity and a non-zero
equilibrium elastic modulus. The sol-gel transition induced by the
nanoparticles is interpreted as the result of the alumina/vesicle interaction,
which are illustrated by transmission electron microscopy. It also suggests a
potential toxicity associated with the modification of the lung fluid
structural and dynamical properties.

observations of them have proven extraordinarily difficult to interpret,
leaving large uncertainties even in basic quantities such as mass outflow
rates. Part of this uncertainty arises from the relatively simplistic models to
which complex wind observations are often fit, which inevitably discard much of
the available information. Here we present an analysis of the wind of the
nearby dwarf starburst galaxy M82 using a semi-analytic model that is able to
take advantage of the full three-dimensional information present in
position-position-velocity data cubes measured in the Hi 21 cm line, the CO 2-1
line, and the Ha line. Our best-fitting model produces position-dependent
spectra in good agreement with the observations, and shows that the total wind
mass flux in the atomic and molecular phases is approx 10 M_sun yr-1
(corresponding to a mass loading factor of about 2 - 3), with less than a
factor of two uncertainty; the mass flux in the warm ionised phase is more
poorly constrained, and may be comparable to or smaller than this. At least
over the few kpc off the plane for which we trace the outflow, it appears to be
a wind escaping the galaxy, rather than a fountain that falls back. Our fits
require that clouds of cool gas entrained into the wind expand only modestly,
suggesting they are magnetically confined. Finally, we demonstrate that
attempts to model the wind using simplifying assumptions such as instantaneous
acceleration and a constant terminal wind speed can yield significantly
erroneous results.

attention due to its broad applications for sensing 360{\deg} surroundings.
Existing approaches in this field suffer from limitations in recovering small
object details and data lost during the ground-truth depth map acquisition. In
this paper, a novel monocular omnidirectional depth estimation model, namely
HiMODE is proposed based on a hybrid CNN+Transformer (encoder-decoder)
architecture whose modules are efficiently designed to mitigate distortion and
computational cost, without performance degradation. Firstly, we design a
feature pyramid network based on the HNet block to extract high-resolution
features near the edges. The performance is further improved, benefiting from a
self and cross attention layer and spatial/temporal patches in the Transformer
encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a spatial residual block is
employed to reduce the number of parameters. By jointly passing the deep
features extracted from an input image at each backbone block, along with the
raw depth maps predicted by the transformer encoder-decoder, through a context
adjustment layer, our model can produce resulting depth maps with better visual
quality than the ground-truth. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the
significance of each individual module. Extensive experiments conducted on
three datasets; Stanford3D, Matterport3D, and SunCG, demonstrate that HiMODE
can achieve state-of-the-art performance for 360{\deg} monocular depth
estimation.

distribution and the fraction of LGRBs required to produce the local rate of
BBH mergers.
  We find that BBH mergers and LGRBs cannot have the same formation history,
unless BBHs mergers have a long coalescence time of several Gyr. This would
imply that BHs born during the peak of long GRB formation at redshift z~2-3
merge within the horizon of current GW interferometers. We also show that LGRBs
are more numerous than BBH mergers, so that most of them do not end their lives
in BBH mergers.
  We interpret these results as an indication that BBH mergers and LGRBs
constitute two distinct populations of stellar mass BHs, with LGRBs being more
frequent than BBH mergers. We speculate that the descendants of LGRBs may

motion transfer task aims to generate a video by learning the motion from the
driving video while preserving the appearance from the source image. In this
paper, we propose a novel structure-aware motion modeling approach, the
deformable anchor model (DAM), which can automatically discover the motion
structure of arbitrary objects without leveraging their prior structure
information. Specifically, inspired by the known deformable part model (DPM),
our DAM introduces two types of anchors or keypoints: i) a number of motion
anchors that capture both appearance and motion information from the source
image and driving video; ii) a latent root anchor, which is linked to the
motion anchors to facilitate better learning of the representations of the
object structure information. Moreover, DAM can be further extended to a
hierarchical version through the introduction of additional latent anchors to
model more complicated structures. By regularizing motion anchors with latent
anchor(s), DAM enforces the correspondences between them to ensure the
structural information is well captured and preserved. Moreover, DAM can be
learned effectively in an unsupervised manner. We validate our proposed DAM for
motion transfer on different benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments clearly
demonstrate that DAM achieves superior performance relative to existing
state-of-the-art methods.

The popularity of Machine learning (ML), Deep learning (DL), and
Artificial intelligence (AI) has risen sharply in recent years. Despite this
spike in popularity, the inner workings of ML and DL algorithms are often
perceived as opaque, and their relationship to classical data analysis tools
remains debated. 2. Although it is often assumed that ML and DL excel primarily
at making predictions, ML and DL can also be used for analytical tasks
traditionally addressed with statistical models. Moreover, most recent
discussions and reviews on ML focus mainly on DL, missing out on synthesizing
the wealth of ML algorithms with different advantages and general principles.
3. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field of ML and DL,
starting by summarizing its historical developments, existing algorithm
families, differences to traditional statistical tools, and universal ML
principles. We then discuss why and when ML and DL models excel at prediction
tasks and where they could offer alternatives to traditional statistical
methods for inference, highlighting current and emerging applications for
ecological problems. Finally, we summarize emerging trends such as scientific
and causal ML, explainable AI, and responsible AI that may significantly impact
ecological data analysis in the future. 4. We conclude that ML and DL are
powerful new tools for predictive modeling and data analysis. The superior
performance of ML and DL algorithms compared to statistical models can be
explained by their higher flexibility and automatic data-dependent complexity
optimization. However, their use for causal inference is still disputed as the
focus of ML and DL methods on predictions creates challenges for the
interpretation of these models. Nevertheless, we expect ML and DL to become an
indispensable tool in E&E, comparable to other traditional statistical tools.

  policies using reinforcement learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Infectious disease outbreaks can have a disruptive impact on public health
and societal processes. As decision making in the context of epidemic
mitigation is hard, reinforcement learning provides a methodology to
automatically learn prevention strategies in combination with complex epidemic
models. Current research focuses on optimizing policies w.r.t. a single
objective, such as the pathogen's attack rate. However, as the mitigation of
epidemics involves distinct, and possibly conflicting criteria (i.a.,
prevalence, mortality, morbidity, cost), a multi-objective approach is
warranted to learn balanced policies. To lift this decision-making process to
real-world epidemic models, we apply deep multi-objective reinforcement
learning and build upon a state-of-the-art algorithm, Pareto Conditioned
Networks (PCN), to learn a set of solutions that approximates the Pareto front
of the decision problem. We consider the first wave of the Belgian COVID-19
epidemic, which was mitigated by a lockdown, and study different deconfinement
strategies, aiming to minimize both COVID-19 cases (i.e., infections and
hospitalizations) and the societal burden that is induced by the applied
mitigation measures. We contribute a multi-objective Markov decision process
that encapsulates the stochastic compartment model that was used to inform
policy makers during the COVID-19 epidemic. As these social mitigation measures
are implemented in a continuous action space that modulates the contact matrix
of the age-structured epidemic model, we extend PCN to this setting. We
evaluate the solution returned by PCN, and observe that it correctly learns to
reduce the social burden whenever the hospitalization rates are sufficiently
low. In this work, we thus show that multi-objective reinforcement learning is
attainable in complex epidemiological models and provides essential insights to
balance complex mitigation policies.

non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev) $v_\Delta$ is introduced to facilitate
the generation of small neutrino masses. A non-zero $v_\Delta$ also affects the
W mass through the electroweak $\rho$ parameter, making it to be less than 1 as
predicted by standard model (SM). The component fields in $\Delta$ come along
introduce additional contributions to reduce the SM rare neutrino trident
scattering cross section. These fields also induce new processes not existed in
SM, such as $l_i \to \overline{ l_j} l_k l_l$ and $l_i \to l_j \gamma$. There
are severe constraints on these processes which limit the effects on neutrino
trident scattering and the $\rho$ parameter and therefore the W mass. The newly
measured W mass by CDF makes the central value of $\rho$ parameter to be larger
than 1, even larger than previously expected. Combining neutrinoless double
beta decay, direct neutrino mass and oscillation data, we find a lower limit
for $v_\Delta$ as a function of the triplet scalar mass $m_\Delta$, $v_\Delta >
(6.3 \sim 8.4) \mathrm{eV} (100 \mathrm{GeV}/m_\Delta)$. To have significant
effect on $\rho$ in this model, $v_\Delta$ needs to be in the range of a GeV or
so. However this implies a very small $m_\Delta$ which is ruled out by data. We
conclude that the effect of triplet vev $v_\Delta$ on the W mass can be
neglected. We also find that at 3$\sigma$ level, the deviation of the ratio for

reduced to be below 1, but is restricted to be larger than 0.98.

propose Pareto Conditioned Networks (PCN), a method that uses a single neural
network to encompass all non-dominated policies. PCN associates every past
transition with its episode's return. It trains the network such that, when
conditioned on this same return, it should reenact said transition. In doing so
we transform the optimization problem into a classification problem. We recover
a concrete policy by conditioning the network on the desired Pareto-efficient
solution. Our method is stable as it learns in a supervised fashion, thus
avoiding moving target issues. Moreover, by using a single network, PCN scales
efficiently with the number of objectives. Finally, it makes minimal
assumptions on the shape of the Pareto front, which makes it suitable to a
wider range of problems than previous state-of-the-art multi-objective

because of many advantages of high speed, large bandwidth, and ultra-low delay.
However, mmWave communications systems suffer from fast fading and frequent
blocking. Hence, the ideal communication environment for mmWave is line of
sight (LOS) channel. To improve the efficiency and capacity of mmWave system,
and to better build the Internet of Everything (IoE) service network, this
paper focuses on the channel identification technique in line-of- sight (LOS)

user equipments (UEs), this paper proposes a novel channel identification
architecture based on eigen features, i.e. eigenmatrix and eigenvector (EMEV)
of channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, this paper explores clustered
delay line (CDL) channel identification with mmWave, which is defined by the
3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). Ther experimental results show that
the EMEV based scheme can achieve identification accuracy of 99.88% assuming

This produces, among others, modified Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequalities

global in the focusing and mass critical case, for initial data that are
suitably small in terms of the best Gagliardo-Nirenberg constant.

effects which are not present in flat systems of the same material. These
emergent magnetochiral effects can lead to frequency nonreciprocity of spin
waves, which has been shown to be a bulk effect of dipolar origin and is
related to a curvature-induced symmetry breaking in the magnetic volume
charges. So far, such effects have been investigated theoretically mostly for
thin shells, where the spatial profiles of the spin waves can be assumed to be
homogeneous along the thickness. Here, using a finite-element dynamic-matrix
approach, we investigate the transition of the spin-wave spectrum from thin to
thick curvilinear shells, at the example of magnetic nanotubes in the vortex
state. With increasing thickness, we observe the appearance of higher-order
radial modes which are strongly hybridized and resemble the
perpendicular-standing-waves (PSSWs) in flat films. Along with an increasing
dispersion asymmetry, we uncover the curvature-induced non-reciprocity of the
mode profiles. This is explained in a very simple picture general for thick
curvilinear shells, considering the inhomogeneity of the emergent geometric
volume charges along the thickness of the shell. Such curvature-induced
mode-profile asymmetry also leads to non-reciprocal hybridization which can
facilitate unidirectional spin-wave propagation. With that, we also show how
curvature allows for nonlinear three-wave splitting of a higher-order radial
mode into secondary modes which can also propagate unidirectionally. We believe
that our study provides a significant contribution to the understanding of the
spin-wave dynamics in curvilinear magnetic systems, but also advertises these
for novel magnonic applications.

this paper, we empirically analyze the vital differences between CBFT and CFFT.
The former transforms features based on the flat-world assumption, which may
cause distortion of regions lying above the ground plane. The latter is limited

time-consuming computation. In order to reap the benefits and avoid the

Furthermore, we design a mutual learning scheme to augment hybrid
transformation by applying feature mimicking. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that with negligible extra overhead, HFT achieves a relative
improvement of 13.3% on the Argoverse dataset and 16.8% on the KITTI 3D Object

object classes with limited data by transferring knowledge gained on abundant
base classes. FSOD approaches commonly assume that both the scarcely provided
examples of novel classes and test-time data belong to the same domain.
However, this assumption does not hold in various industrial and robotics
applications, where a model can learn novel classes from a source domain while
inferring on classes from a target domain. In this work, we address the task of
zero-shot domain adaptation, also known as domain generalization, for FSOD.
Specifically, we assume that neither images nor labels of the novel classes in
the target domain are available during training. Our approach for solving the
domain gap is two-fold. First, we leverage a meta-training paradigm, where we
learn the domain shift on the base classes, then transfer the domain knowledge
to the novel classes. Second, we propose various data augmentations techniques
on the few shots of novel classes to account for all possible domain-specific
information. To constraint the network into encoding domain-agnostic
class-specific representations only, a contrastive loss is proposed to maximize
the mutual information between foreground proposals and class embeddings and
reduce the network's bias to the background information from target domain. Our
experiments on the T-LESS, PASCAL-VOC, and ExDark datasets show that the
proposed approach succeeds in alleviating the domain gap considerably without
utilizing labels or images of novel categories from the target domain.

We aim to produce a new taxonomic classification of asteroids based on their

computed from the Sloan Moving Objects Catalog using the HG12 system. We
calculated the absolute colors with them. To perform the taxonomic
classification, we applied a unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as
fuzzy C-means. This is a useful soft clustering tool for working with {data

regions of overlap between them. We have chosen to work with the four main
taxonomic complexes, C, S, X, and V, as they comprise most of the known

than 60% probability of belonging to the assigned taxonomic class, with 162 of

topological superconductors, CdGM states are predicted to coexist with
zero-energy, chargeless states widely known as Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Due
to their energy difference, current experiments rely on scanning tunneling

electrostatic inhomogeneities can push trivial CdGM states arbitrarily close to
zero energy in non-topological systems where no MZM is present. Furthermore,
the BCS charge of CdGM states is suppressed under the same mechanism. Through
exploration of the impurity parameter space, we establish that these two

charge shifts in CdGM may be enough to imitate the spectroscopic signatures of
MZMs even in cases where the estimated CdGM level spacing (in the absence of
impurities) is much larger than the typical experimental level broadening.

the content representations of the source. However, these few-shot font
generation methods either fail to capture content-independent style
representations, or employ localized component-wise style representations,
which is insufficient to model many Chinese font styles that involve
hyper-component features such as inter-component spacing and

pre-training strategy and a cross-modality transformer-based encoder that is
conditioned jointly on the glyph image and the corresponding stroke labels. The
cross-modality encoder is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner to allow
effective capture of cross- and intra-modality correlations, which facilitates
the content-style disentanglement and modeling style representations of all

multi-view 2D image features into the 3D BEV feature in ego-car coordinates.
Such BEV representation is important as it enables different tasks to share a
single encoder. Our framework further contains four important designs that
benefit both accuracy and efficiency: (1) An efficient BEV encoder design that
reduces the spatial dimension of a voxel feature map. (2) A dynamic box
assignment strategy that uses learning-to-match to assign ground-truth 3D boxes
with anchors. (3) A BEV centerness re-weighting that reinforces with larger

pre-training and auxiliary supervision. We show that these designs
significantly benefit the ill-posed camera-based 3D perception tasks where
depth information is missing. M$^2$BEV is memory efficient, allowing
significantly higher resolution images as input, with faster inference speed.

information to autonomous agents. It encompasses everything from concrete
instructions to abstract descriptions of the world. Despite this, natural
language is often challenging to learn from: it is difficult for machine
learning methods to make appropriate inferences from such a wide range of
input. This paper proposes a generalization of reward design as a unifying
principle to ground linguistic communication: speakers choose utterances to
maximize expected rewards from the listener's future behaviors. We first extend
reward design to incorporate reasoning about unknown future states in a linear
bandit setting. We then define a speaker model which chooses utterances
according to this objective. Simulations show that short-horizon speakers
(reasoning primarily about a single, known state) tend to use instructions,
while long-horizon speakers (reasoning primarily about unknown, future states)
tend to describe the reward function. We then define a pragmatic listener which
performs inverse reward design by jointly inferring the speaker's latent
horizon and rewards. Our findings suggest that this extension of reward design
to linguistic communication, including the notion of a latent speaker horizon,
is a promising direction for achieving more robust alignment outcomes from

valuable tool for model-based planning, closed-loop control, gain tuning, and
state estimation. Contrary to the case of fixed based manipulators with
prismatic or rotary joints, the state space of moving-base robotic systems such
as humanoids, quadruped robots, or aerial manipulators cannot be globally
parametrized by a finite number of independent coordinates. This impossibility
is a direct consequence of the fact that the state of these systems includes
the system's global orientation, formally described as an element of the
special orthogonal group SO(3). As a consequence, obtaining the linearization
of the equations of motion for these systems is typically resolved, from a
practical perspective, by locally parameterizing the system's attitude by means
of, e.g., Euler or Cardan angles. This has the drawback, however, of
introducing artificial parameterization singularities and extra derivative
computations. In this contribution, we show that it is actually possible to
define a notion of linearization that does not require the use of a local
parameterization for the system's orientation, obtaining a mathematically
elegant, recursive, and singularity-free linearization for moving-based robot
systems. Recursiveness, in particular, is obtained by proposing a nontrivial
modification of existing recursive algorithms to allow for computations of the
geometric derivatives of the inverse dynamics and the inverse of the mass
matrix of the robotic system. The correctness of the proposed algorithm is
validated by means of a numerical comparison with the result obtained via

wetting patterns were observed due to interfacial and polymer swelling effects.
This in-situ investigation reveals a slow wetting progression over six hours

an increased flux leads to faster wetting kinetics as the evolving wetting

additionally impacts the wetting kinetics by shifting the prevalent pressure
conditions. Although in dead-end mode, the wetting progression is non-uniform
along the membrane module length. In addition to this parameter study,
different pre-wetting agents' effect on the displacement behavior was
investigated in depth. This study helps to understand (a) complex wetting
phenomena inside multibore membranes in dead-end filtration, (b) the membranes'
interaction with their surroundings due to neighboring membranes, and (c) the
effect of the used fluid system for displacement on the resulting wetting
patterns.

address the problem that arousal level prediction fails when arousal and

of such arousal and non-arousal words, we generate word vectors based on

network is an attractive alternative to traditional solvers due to its
elegance, greater flexibility and the ease of incorporating observed data.
However, training such physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is notoriously
difficult in practice since PINNs often converge to wrong solutions. In this
paper, we address this problem by training an ensemble of PINNs. Our approach
is motivated by the observation that individual PINN models find similar
solutions in the vicinity of points with targets (e.g., observed data or
initial conditions) while their solutions may substantially differ farther away
from such points. Therefore, we propose to use the ensemble agreement as the
criterion for gradual expansion of the solution interval, that is including new
points for computing the loss derived from differential equations. Due to the
flexibility of the domain expansion, our algorithm can easily incorporate
measurements in arbitrary locations. In contrast to the existing PINN
algorithms with time-adaptive strategies, the proposed algorithm does not need
a pre-defined schedule of interval expansion and it treats time and space
equally. We experimentally show that the proposed algorithm can stabilize PINN
training and yield performance competitive to the recent variants of PINNs
trained with time adaptation.

fs were possible for lipid bilayer systems without proteins. This limitation is
relevant for, e.g., phase separating lipid mixtures that require long
equilibration times. We derive a quantitative kinetic model of time-integration
instabilities in molecular dynamics (MD) as a function of time step, ion
concentration and mass, system size, and simulation time. With this model, we
demonstrate that ion-water interactions are the main source of instability at
physiological conditions, followed closely by ion-ion interactions. We show
that increasing the ionic masses makes it possible to use time steps up to 40
fs with minimal impact on static equilibrium properties and on dynamical
quantities such as lipid and ion diffusion coefficients. Increasing the size of
the bead representing the ions (and thus changing their hydration) also permits
longer time steps. The use of larger time steps in Martini 3 simulations

allocates resources in the cloud (e.g., IP addresses) and thereafter leverages
latent configuration to exploit prior tenants. To measure and categorize cloud
squatting we deployed a custom Internet telescope within the Amazon Web

servers receiving 1.5 million unique IP addresses (56% of the available pool)
over 101 days beginning in March of 2021. We identified 4 classes of cloud

latent configurations. We discovered that exploitable configurations were both
common and in many cases extremely dangerous; we received over 5 million cloud
messages, many containing sensitive data such as financial transactions, GPS
location, and PII. Within the 7 classes of third-party services, we identified
dozens of exploitable software systems spanning hundreds of servers (e.g.,

primary step of using the QAOA is the efficient Hamiltonian construction based
on different problem instances. Hence, we solve the maximum likelihood (ML)
detection problem for general constellations by appropriately adapting the
QAOA, which gives rise to a new paradigm in communication systems. We first
transform the ML detection problem into a weighted minimum $N$-satisfiability
(WMIN-$N$-SAT) problem, where we formulate the objective function of the
WMIN-$N$-SAT as a pseudo Boolean function. Furthermore, we formalize the
connection between the degree of the objective function and the Gray-labelled
modulation constellations. Explicitly, we show a series of results exploring
the connection between the coefficients of the monomials and the patterns of
the associated constellation points, which substantially simplifies the
objective function with respect to the problem Hamiltonian of the QAOA. In
particular, for an M-ary Gray-mapped quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM)
constellation, we show that the specific qubits encoding the in-phase
components and those encoding the quadrature components are independent in the
quantum system of interest, which allows the in-phase and quadrature components
to be detected separately using the QAOA. Furthermore, we characterize the
degree of the objective function in the WMIN-$N$-SAT problem corresponding to
the ML detection of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) channels.
Finally, we evaluate the approximation ratio of the QAOA for the ML detection
problem of quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) relying on QAOA circuits of

In unsupervised settings where the data harbour latent classes/clusters, the
question of whether class discriminatory signals are retained under projection
is crucial. In the case of mean differences between classes, this question has
been well studied. However, in many contemporary applications, notably in
biomedicine, group differences at the level of covariance or graphical model
structure are important. Motivated by such applications, in this paper we ask
whether linear projections can preserve differences in second order structure
between latent groups. We focus on unsupervised projections, which can be
computed without knowledge of class labels. We discuss a simple theoretical
framework to study the behaviour of such projections which we use to inform an
analysis via quasi-exhaustive enumeration. This allows us to consider the
performance, over more than a hundred thousand sets of data-generating
population parameters, of two popular projections, namely random projections
(RP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Across this broad range of
regimes, PCA turns out to be more effective at retaining second order signals
than RP and is often even competitive with supervised projection. We complement
these results with fully empirical experiments showing 0-1 loss using simulated
and real data. We study also the effect of projection dimension, drawing
attention to a bias-variance trade-off in this respect. Our results show that
PCA can indeed be a suitable first-step for unsupervised analysis, including in
cases where differential covariance or graphical model structure are of
interest.

to the scattering by many, randomly placed and oriented, pinned dislocation
segments, is considered in a continuum mechanics framework. The scattering
mechanism is that of an elastic string of length L that re-radiates as a
response to an incoming wave. The scatterers are thus not static but have their
own dynamics. A Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation is established, and a
Ward-Takahashi Identity (WTI) is demonstrated. The BS equation is written as a
spectral problem that, using the WTI, is solved in the diffusive limit. To
leading order a diffusion behavior indeed results, and an explicit formula for
the diffusion coeffcient is obtained. It can be evaluated in an Independent
Scattering Approximation (ISA) in the absence of intrinsic damping. It depends
not only on the bare longitudinal and transverse wave velocities but also on
the renormalized velocities, as well as attenuation coeffcients, of the
coherent waves. The influence of the length scale given by L, and of the
resonant behavior for frequencies near the resonance frequency of the strings,
can be explicitly identified. A Kubo representation for the diffusion constant
can be identified. Previous generic results, obtained with an energy transfer
formalism, are recovered when the number of dislocations per unit volume is
small. This includes the equipartition of diffusive energy density which,
however, does not hold in general. The formalism bears a number of similarities
with the behavior of electromagnetic waves in a medium with a random
distribution of dielectric scatterers; the elastic interaction, however, is
momentum dependent.

general relativistic (GR) metric assumed to describe the Galaxy. Here we
generalize the concept, and derive the most general exact GR model for a
stationary axi-symmetric dynamically cold dust structure.
  We explicitly show how deviations from the commonly adopted Newtonian
dynamics are indeed manifest even at low velocities and low densities. We
provide for the first time a detailed description of the frequency shift
experienced by photons travelling from any emission site within an external
disc galaxy to the observer, relating the outcome of the shift measurement to
the gravitational properties of the galaxy. Finally, we devise a novel,
groundbreaking observational test potentially able to fully characterize the GR
metric under the minimal set of assumptions mentioned above. The proposed
experiment exploits the effects non-diagonal GR terms have on the frequency
shift of photons, ultimately providing a test to evaluate whether dark matter
is actually required by disc galaxy kinematics.

polarized femtosecond laser pulses is observed in our experiment. The obtained
shadowgraph snapshots demonstrate that a circularly polarized pulse may produce
several randomly-oriented jets effused from the expanding droplets, while a
linearly polarized laser pulse generates strictly the cruciform jets. The
latter orientation is tied with polarization plane, rotation of which causes
rotation of the cruciform jets by the same angle. To shed light on the
experimental data we performed molecular dynamics simulation of droplet
expansion induced by angle-dependent heating.
  Our simulation shows that the jet directions are determined by an oriented
angle-dependent energy distribution within a frontal hemisphere layer of
droplet after absorption of linearly polarized light. As a result, the produced
flow velocity field guided by surface tension forms two high-speed opposite
jets oriented across the electric field vector as in our experiment.
  A shock-wave pulse generated in the frontal layer has angle-dependent
amplitude inherited from the oriented energy deposition. The release part of
shock pulse produces a cavitation zone nearby the droplet center, and thus an
expanding spherical shell is formed from the droplet. The flow velocities
within a rearside hemisphere of the shell, produced after reflection of the
shock wave from the rear side of droplet, generate two low-speed opposite jets
oriented along the electric field vector. Thus we found that the cruciform jets
are originated independently from the frontal and rear sides of droplet, and a
pair of frontal jets is faster than a pair of rearside jets.

prominent research area in AI is ethics, which currently has no set of
benchmarks nor commonly accepted way for measuring the 'ethicality' of an AI
system. In this paper, drawing upon research in moral philosophy and
metaethics, we argue that it is impossible to develop such a benchmark. As
such, alternative mechanisms are necessary for evaluating whether an AI system
is 'ethical'. This is especially pressing in light of the prevalence of
applied, industrial AI research. We argue that it makes more sense to talk
about 'values' (and 'value alignment') rather than 'ethics' when considering
the possible actions of present and future AI systems. We further highlight
that, because values are unambiguously relative, focusing on values forces us
to consider explicitly what the values are and whose values they are. Shifting
the emphasis from ethics to values therefore gives rise to several new ways of
understanding how researchers might advance research programmes for robustly
safe or beneficial AI. We conclude by highlighting a number of possible ways

are used to predict the mechanics of biomimetic composites. The proposed
approach is validated by comparing coarse-grained finite element predictions
against full-field strain distributions measured using digital image
correlation. To evaluate the degree of coarse-graining on model accuracy,
pre-notched specimens decorated with a binarized version of a renowned painting
were modeled. Subsequently, coarse-graining is used to predict the fracture
behavior of bio-inspired composites incorporating complex designs, such as
functional gradients and hierarchical organizations. Finally, as a showcase of
the proposed approach, the inverse coarse-graining is combined with a
theoretical model of bone tissue adaptation to optimize the microarchitecture
of a 3D-printed femur. The predicted properties were in exceptionally good
agreement with the corresponding experimental results. Therefore, the

the process of deducing the goal or meaning of the user's request and mapping
it to one of the known intents for further processing. Gaining insights into
unrecognized utterances -- user requests the systems fail to attribute to a
known intent -- is therefore a key process in continuous improvement of
goal-oriented dialog systems.
  We present an end-to-end pipeline for processing unrecognized user
utterances, deployed in a real-world, commercial task-oriented dialog system,
including a specifically-tailored clustering algorithm, a novel approach to
cluster representative extraction, and cluster naming. We evaluated the
proposed components, demonstrating their benefits in the analysis of
unrecognized user requests.

force strengths of proton and neutron are optimized together with the
point-coupling constants, and are justified in satisfactory reproducing the
empirical pairing gaps. The comparison of experimental binding energies
compiled in AME2020 for 91 nuclei with the ones generated from the present and
other commonly used point-coupling interactions indicates that the
implementation of PC-L3R in relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov yields the lowest
root-mean-square deviation. The charge radii satisfactory agree with
experiment. Meanwhile, PC-L3R is capable of estimating the saturation
properties of the symmetric nuclear matter and of appropriately predicting the
isospin and mass dependence of binding energy. The experimental odd-even
staggering of single nucleon separation energies is well reproduced. The
comparison of the estimated binding energies for 7,373 nuclei based on the

factorizability could be derived from the more fundamental principle of local
causality. Here we show that, contrary to what is commonly assumed, in order to
derive factorizability from the principle of local causality, a non-trivial
assumption, similar but strictly independent of settings independence, is
required. Loosely speaking, such an extra assumption demands independence
between the states of the measurement apparatuses. We conclude that it is
possible to construct a model, satisfying both the principle of local causality

performance in a dialog system. For end-to-end (E2E) SLU, previous work has
used dialog history in text form, which makes the model dependent on a cascaded
automatic speech recognizer (ASR). This rescinds the benefits of an E2E system
which is intended to be compact and robust to ASR errors. In this paper, we
propose a hierarchical conversation model that is capable of directly using
dialog history in speech form, making it fully E2E. We also distill semantic
knowledge from the available gold conversation transcripts by jointly training
a similar text-based conversation model with an explicit tying of acoustic and
semantic embeddings. We also propose a novel technique that we call DropFrame
to deal with the long training time incurred by adding dialog history in an E2E
manner. On the HarperValleyBank dialog dataset, our E2E history integration
outperforms a history independent baseline by 7.7% absolute F1 score on the
task of dialog action recognition. Our model performs competitively with the
state-of-the-art history based cascaded baseline, but uses 48% fewer
parameters. In the absence of gold transcripts to fine-tune an ASR model, our
model outperforms this baseline by a significant margin of 10% absolute F1

coin-betting algorithms and propose the Coin Betting Politex (CBP) algorithm.
Assuming that the action-value functions are $\varepsilon_b$-close to the span
of the $d$-dimensional state-action features and no sampling errors, we prove
that $T$ iterations of CBP result in an $O\left(\frac{1}{(1 - \gamma)^3

plate, cubic splines, tensor products and Markov random fields. In addition,
this framework accounts for all types of censoring as well as left-truncation.
Estimation is conducted by using an efficient and stable penalized
likelihood-based algorithm whose empirical performance is evaluated through
extensive simulation studies. Some theoretical and asymptotic results are
discussed. Two case studies are presented using population-based cancer data

detailed and quantitative description of local galaxy environment by way of the
local number density (eta) and tidal strength (Q) parameters, star formation
efficiency (SFE(HI)), and HI integrated profile asymmetries, we present
plausible pathways for the broadening of the pair sample HI deficiency
distribution towards both high and low deficiencies compared to the narrower
isolated galaxy sample distribution (i.e. sigma_pairs = 0.34 versus sigma_AMIGA
= 0.28). We associate the gas-rich tail of the pair deficiency distribution
with the highest Q values, large profile asymmetries, and low SFEs. From this
we infer that merger activity is enhancing gas supplies, as well as disrupting
the efficiency of star formation, via strong gravitational torques. The
gas-poor wing of the deficiency distribution appears to be populated with
galaxies in denser environments (with larger eta values on average), more akin
to groups. Despite our gas-rich selection criterion, there is a small
population of early-type galaxies in the pair sample, which primarily fall in
the positive deficiency wing of the distribution. These results suggest that a
combination of a denser galaxy environment, early-type morphology, and higher
stellar mass, is contributing to the broadening of the deficiency distribution
towards larger deficiencies.

literature about analytics for software startups. This study set out to address
the knowledge gap by exploring how analytics is understood in the context of
software startups. To this end, we collected the qualitative data of three
analytics platforms that are mostly used by startups from multiple sources. We
covered platform documentation as well as experience reports of the software
startups using these platforms. The data was analyzed using content analysis
techniques. Four high-level concepts were identified that encapsulate the real
understanding of software startups on analytics, including instrumentation of
analytics, experimentation, diagnostic analysis, and getting insights. The
first concept describes how startups set up analytics and the latter three
illustrate the usage scenarios of analytics. This study is the first step
toward understanding analytics in the software startup context. The identified
concepts can guide further investigation of analytics in this context. It also
provides some insights for software startups to set up analytics for
data-informed decisions. Given the limitation of the data used in the study,
the immediate next step is to ground as well as validate the acquired

such as driving a vehicle in traffic, it is natural for human drivers to plan
fallback strategies as a backup to use if ever there is an unexpected change in
the environment. Knowing to expect the unexpected, and planning for such
outcomes, increases our capability for being robust to unseen scenarios and may
help prevent catastrophic failures. Control of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has a
particular interest in knowing when and how to use fallback strategies in the
interest of safety. Due to imperfect information available to an AV about its
environment, it is important to have alternate strategies at the ready which
might not have been deduced from the original training data distribution.
  In this paper we present a principled approach for a model-free Reinforcement
Learning (RL) agent to capture multiple modes of behaviour in an environment.
We introduce an extra pseudo-reward term to the reward model, to encourage
exploration to areas of state-space different from areas privileged by the
optimal policy. We base this reward term on a distance metric between the
trajectories of agents, in order to force policies to focus on different areas
of state-space than the initial exploring agent. Throughout the paper, we refer
to this particular training paradigm as learning fallback strategies.
  We apply this method to an autonomous driving scenario, and show that we are
able to learn useful policies that would have otherwise been missed out on
during training, and unavailable to use when executing the control algorithm.

long-lived localized phase in the thermodynamic limit has been the subject of
intense recent debate. While in one dimension substantial evidence for the
existence of such a many-body localized (MBL) phase exists, the behavior in
higher dimensions remains an open puzzle. In two-dimensional disordered
systems, for instance, it has been argued that rare regions may lead to
thermalization of the whole system through a mechanism dubbed the avalanche
instability. In quasiperiodic systems, rare regions are altogether absent and
the fate of a putative many-body localized phase has hitherto remained largely
unexplored. In this work, we investigate the localization properties of two
many-body quasiperiodic models, which are two-dimensional generalizations of
the Aubry-Andr\'e model. By studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of large
systems, we find a long-lived MBL phase, in contrast to random systems.
Furthermore, we show that deterministic lines of weak potential, which appear
in investigated quasiperiodic models, support large-scale transport, while the
system as a whole does not thermalize. Our results demonstrate that
quasiperiodic many-body systems have the remarkable and counter-intuitive
capability of exhibiting coexisting localization and transport properties - a
phenomenon reminiscent of the behavior of supersolids. Our findings are of
direct experimental relevance and can be tested, for instance, using
state-of-the-art cold atomic systems.

full-colour image from the grey-scale prior. It is an ill-posed problem, as
there are many plausible colourisations for a given grey-scale prior. The
current SOTA in auto-colourisation involves image-to-image type Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks with Generative Adversarial Networks showing the
greatest promise. The end goal of colourisation is to produce full colour
images that appear plausible to the human viewer, but human assessment is
costly and time consuming. This work assesses how well commonly used objective
measures correlate with human opinion. We also attempt to determine what facets
of colourisation have the most significant effect on human opinion. For each of
20 images from the BSD dataset, we create 65 recolourisations made up of local
and global changes. Opinion scores are then crowd sourced using the Amazon
Mechanical Turk and together with the images this forms an extensible dataset
called the Human Evaluated Colourisation Dataset (HECD). While we find
statistically significant correlations between human-opinion scores and a small
number of objective measures, the strength of the correlations is low. There is
also evidence that human observers are most intolerant to an incorrect hue of
naturally occurring objects.

imaging. The strength of EIT is its ability to reconstruct images of the body's
internal structures through radiation-safe techniques. EIT is regarded as safe
for patients' health, and it is currently being actively researched. This paper
investigates the application of EIT during deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery
as a means to identify targets during operations. DBS involves a surgical
procedure in which a lead or electrode array is implanted in a specific target
area in the brain. Electrical stimulations are then used to modulate neural
circuits within the target area to reduce disabling neurological symptoms. The
main difficulty in performing DBS surgery is to accurately position the lead in
the target area before commencing the treatment. Brain tissue shifts during DBS
surgery can be as large as the target size when compared with the pre-operative
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) images. To address
this problem, a solution based on open-domain EIT to reconstruct images
surrounding the probe during DBS surgery is proposed. Data acquisition and
image reconstruction were performed, and artificial intelligence was applied to
enhance the resulting images. The results showed that the proposed method is
rapid, produces valuable high-quality images, and constitutes a first step
towards in-vivo study.

Incorporating the observed red-tilted spectrum of curvature perturbation, the

the spectral tilt. Requiring one-loop correction to be much smaller than the
tree-level contribution leads to an upper bound on primordial non-Gaussianity.
While observationally allowed region of non-Gaussian parameter space is found
to be entirely included by the region, where one-loop correction is smaller
than the tree-level contribution, an appreciably large region has one-loop
correction larger than 1% or even 10% of the latter. If future observations
conclude non-Gaussianity falls in such a region, then it would be important to
incorporate higher-order corrections to the spectrum in order to achieve
precise cosmology. In some extreme cases, where one-loop correction has a
comparable magnitude to the tree-level contribution, it might indicate
breakdown of the cosmological perturbation theory in the context of

replicating the conditions for solar-like differential rotation and meridional
circulation using the results of helioseismic inversions as a constraint.
Inferences of meridional circulation, however, have provided controversial
results showing the possibility of one, two, or multiple cells along the
radius. To resolve this controversy and develop a more robust understanding of
global flow regimes in the solar interior, we apply a ""forward-modeling""
approach to the analysis of helioseismic signatures of meridional circulation
profiles obtained from numerical simulations. We employ the global acoustic
modeling code GALE to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves through
regimes of mean mass flows generated by global hydrodynamic and
magnetohydrodynamic models: EULAG, the Pencil Code, and the Rayleigh code.
These models are used to create synthetic dopplergram data products, used as
inputs for local time-distance helioseismology techniques. Helioseismic
travel-time signals from solutions obtained through global numerical
simulations are compared directly with inferences from solar observations, in
order to set additional constraints on global model parameters in a direct way.
We show that even though these models are able to replicate solar-like
differential rotation, the resulting rotationally-constrained convection
develops a multi-cell global meridional circulation profile that is measurably
inconsistent with local time-distance inferences of solar observations.
However, we find that the development of rotationally-unconstrained convection
close to the model surface is able to maintain solar-like differential
rotation, while having a significant impact on the helioseismic travel-time
signal, replicating solar observations within one standard deviation of the
error due to noise.

Hence, the complexity of the newly added features, and the frequency of the

success, we draw an empirical observation that there is a training objective
gap between pre-training and fine-tuning stages: e.g., mask language modeling
objective requires local understanding of the masked token and the
span-extraction objective requires global understanding and reasoning of the
input passage/paragraph and question, leading to the discrepancy between
pre-training and xMRC. In this paper, we first design a pre-training task
tailored for xSL named Cross-lingual Language Informative Span Masking (CLISM)

ContrAstive-Consistency Regularization (CACR), which utilizes contrastive
learning to encourage the consistency between representations of input parallel
sequences via unsupervised cross-lingual instance-wise training signals during
pre-training. By these means, our methods not only bridge the gap between
pretrain-finetune, but also enhance PLMs to better capture the alignment

projects, accurately identify the excellent scientific research team, and
intuitively and comprehensively describe the scientific research team, it is of
great significance for the scientific research management department to
comprehensively understand and objectively evaluate the scientific research
team. At present, the research work on the construction of accurate
three-dimensional portrait of scientific research team is relatively less. In
view of the practical demand of scientific research management department, this
paper proposes an accurate stereo portrait generation algorithm of scientific
research team. The algorithm includes three modules: research team
identification, research topic extraction and research team portrait
generation. Firstly, the leader of the scientific research team is identified
based on the iterative middle centrality ranking method, and the members of the
scientific research team are identified through the 2-faction and snowball
methods, so as to realize the identification of the scientific research team.
Then, considering the statistical information of words and the co-occurrence
features of words in the research team, the research topics of the research
team are extracted to improve the accuracy of research topic extraction.
Finally, the research team portrait generation module generates the accurate
three-dimensional portrait of the research team through the generation of the
research team profile, the construction of the research cooperation
relationship, and the construction of the research team topic cloud. The
research team is identified on the data set of scientific research
achievements, and the accurate three-dimensional portraits of the research team
are generated and visualized. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

consciousness is a fundamental aspect of reality instead of a product or
consequence of physical processes (i.e., brain activity). Panpsychism is an
elegant solution to the mind-body problem: it effectively rids itself of the
explanatory gap materialist theories of consciousness suffer from. However,
many theorists and experimentalists doubt panpsychism can ever be successful as
a scientific theory, as it cannot be empirically verified or falsified. In this
paper, I present a panpsychist model based on the controversial idea that
consciousness may be a so called higher physical dimension. Although this
notion seems outrageous, I show that the idea has surprising explanatory power,
even though the model (as most models) is most likely wrong. Most importantly,
though, it results in a panpsychist model that yields predictions that can be
empirically verified or falsified. As such, the model's main purpose is to
serve as an example how a metaphysical model of consciousness can be specified
in such a way that they can be tested in a scientifically rigorous way.

its eigenmodes. For a discrete system, eigenmode parity on a specific subset of
sites may also originate from so-called latent symmetry. This symmetry is
hidden, but can be revealed in an effective model upon reduction of the
original system onto the latently symmetric sites. Here we show how latent
symmetries can be leveraged for continuous wave setups in the form of acoustic
networks. These are systematically designed to have point-wise amplitude parity
between selected waveguide junctions for all low frequency eigenmodes. We
further develop a modular principle: latently symmetric networks can be
interconnected to feature multiple latently symmetric junction pairs, allowing
the design of arbitrarily large latently symmetric networks. By connecting such
networks to a mirror symmetric subsystem, we design asymmetric setups featuring
eigenmodes with domain-wise parity. Bridging the gap between discrete and
continuous models, our work takes a pivotal step towards exploiting hidden
geometrical symmetries in realistic wave setups.

heart and is used to detect fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
Conventionally, to capture the precise electrical activity, clinical experts
use multiple-lead ECGs (typically 12 leads). But in recent times, large-size
deep learning models have been used to detect these diseases. However, such
models require heavy compute resources like huge memory and long inference
time. To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose a low-parameter model, named
Low Resource Heart-Network (LRH-Net), which uses fewer leads to detect ECG
anomalies in a resource-constrained environment. A multi-level knowledge
distillation process is used on top of that to get better generalization
performance on our proposed model. The multi-level knowledge distillation
process distills the knowledge to LRH-Net trained on a reduced number of leads
from higher parameter (teacher) models trained on multiple leads to reduce the
performance gap. The proposed model is evaluated on the PhysioNet-2020
challenge dataset with constrained input. The parameters of the LRH-Net are
106x less than our teacher model for detecting CVDs. The performance of the
LRH-Net was scaled up to 3.2% and the inference time scaled down by 75%

parameter-intensive deep learning techniques, the proposed methodology uses a
subset of ECG leads using the low resource LRH-Net, making it eminently
suitable for deployment on edge devices.

probability that such matches arise can serve as a novel fairness criterion to
compare and evaluate match schedules. Our approach is illustrated by the UEFA

optimal strategy for disease control is to obtain a large number of simulations
of disease transitions under different scenarios. Therefore, the models that
can simulate the spreading of diseases under scenarios closer to the reality
and are with high efficiency are preferred. In the realistic social networks,
the random contact, including contacts between people in the public places and
the public transits, becomes the important access for the spreading of
infectious diseases. In this paper, a model can efficiently simulate the
spreading of infectious diseases under random contacts is proposed. In this
approach, the random contact between people is characterized by the random
matrix with elements randomly generated and the spread of the diseases is
simulated by the Markov process. We report an interesting property of the
proposed model: the main indicators of the spreading of the diseases such as
the death rate are invariant of the size of the population. Therefore,
representative simulations can be conducted on models consist of small number
of populations. The main advantage of this model is that it can easily simulate
the spreading of diseases under more realistic scenarios and thus is able to
give a large number of simulations needed for the searching of the optimal
control strategy. Based on this work, the reinforcement learning will be
introduced to give the optimal control strategy in the following work.

analysis of complex engineering systems given its deductive nature and

a subsystem or system may have over its basic components. In this study,
quantum computing is leveraged to propose a novel approach to encode a

uses quantum bits to represent basic events, effectively encoding the original
fault tree into a quantum circuit. The execution of the resulting quantum
circuit represents a full simulation of the fault tree, and multiple executions
can be utilized to compute the failure probability of the whole system. The
proposed approach is tested on a case study portraying a dynamic positioning
system. Results verify that the quantum-based proposed approach is able to
effectively obtain the dynamic positioning failure probability through
simulation, opening promising opportunities for future investigations in the
area.

now existed for almost 40 years. Different aspects and variations of the method
have been studied in multiple theses and research articles, and reviews are
also becoming available for certain subtopics. Still a field of active
development with many unsolved problems, deflectometry now encompasses a large
variety of application domains, hardware setup types, and processing workflows
designed for different purposes, and spans a range from qualitative defect
inspection of large vehicles to precision measurements of microscopic optics.
Over these years, many exciting developments have accumulated in the underlying
theory, in the systems design, and in the implementation specifics. This
diversity of topics is difficult to grasp for experts and non-experts alike and
may present an obstacle to a wider acceptance of deflectometry as a useful tool
in other research fields and in the industry.
  This paper presents an attempt to summarize the status of deflectometry, and
to map relations between its notable ""spin-off"" branches. The intention of the
paper is to provide a common communication basis for practitioners and at the
same time to offer a convenient entry point for those interested in learning
and using the method. The list of references is extensive but definitely not
exhaustive, introducing some prominent trends and established research groups
in order to facilitate further self-directed exploration by the reader.

formulation of four-dimensional variational data assimilation in large-scale
applications. We present a space-time decomposition approach that employs
domain decomposition along both the spatial and temporal directions in the
overlapping case and involves partitioning of both the solution and the
operators. Starting from the global functional defined on the entire domain, we
obtain a type of regularized local functionals on the set of subdomains
providing the order reduction of both the predictive and the data assimilation
models. We analyze the algorithm convergence and its performance in terms of
reduction of time complexity and algorithmic scalability. The numerical
experiments are carried out on the shallow water equation on the sphere
according to the setup available at the Ocean Synthesis/Reanalysis Directory
provided by Hamburg University.
