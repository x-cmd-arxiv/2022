field have suggested the presence of both the fluctuation-induced vortex liquid
regime and a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) vortex lattice. To get a
general picture on the magnetic phase diagram in type II superconductors with
strong superconducting (SC) fluctuation and strong paramagnetic pair-breaking
(PPB) such as FeSe, the vortex lattice melting curve Hm(T) is theoretically
investigated in the situations where a FFLO state is expected to occur. In
general, the PPB tends to narrow the vortex liquid regime intervening between
Hc2(T) and Hm(T). In particular, the vortex liquid regime is found to rapidly
shrink upon entering, by cooling, the temperature range in which the FFLO state
with a periodic modulation parallel to the magnetic field is stable in the mean
field theory. Based on the present results, the high field SC phase diagrams of
FeSe in the parallel and perpendicular field configurations are discussed.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated compelling road pothole

Model extension where the type-II seesaw and scotogenic mechanisms coexist. The
model features a flavour $\mathcal{Z}_8$ discrete symmetry which is broken down
to a $\mathcal{Z}_2$, stabilising the (scalar or fermion) DM particle.
Spontaneous CP violation is implemented through the complex vacuum expectation
value of a singlet scalar field, inducing observable CP-violating effects in
the lepton sector. The structure of the effective neutrino mass matrix leads to
constraints on the low-energy neutrino observables, namely the atmospheric
neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, the Dirac CP-violating phase $\delta$ and
the absolute neutrino mass scale $m_{\rm lightest}$. In particular, in most
cases, the model selects one $\theta_{23}$ octant with $\delta \simeq 3\pi/2$.
Moreover, the obtained lower bounds on $m_{\rm lightest}$ are typically in the
range probed by cosmology. We also analyse the constraints imposed on the model
by current experimental limits on charged lepton flavour violating (cLFV)
processes, as well as future projected sensitivities. It is shown that the
Higgs triplet and scotogenic contributions to cLFV never overlap and that the
interplay among Yukawa couplings, dark charged scalar masses and mixing leads
to a wide parameter-space region compatible with current experimental bounds.
We investigate the scalar and fermion DM parameter space of our model by
considering relic density, direct-detection (DD) and collider constraints. For
scalar DM the mass interval $68 \ \text{GeV} \lesssim m_{\text{DM}} \lesssim 90
\ \text{GeV}$ is viable and will be probed by future DD searches. In the
fermion DM case, correct relic density is always obtained for $m_{\text{DM}}
\gtrsim 45$ GeV thanks to dark fermion-scalar coannihilation channels.

future low-carbon grid scenarios must incorporate detailed representation of
grid operations. Often CEMs are formulated to model grid operations over
representative periods that are sampled from the original input data using
clustering algorithms. However, such representative period selection (RPS)
methods are limited by the declining efficacy of the clustering algorithm with
increasing dimensionality of the input data and do not consider the relative
importance of input data variations on CEM outcomes. Here, we propose a RPS
method that addresses these limitations by incorporating dimensionality
reduction, accomplished via neural network based autoencoders, prior to
clustering. Such dimensionality reduction not only improves the performance of
the clustering algorithm, but also facilitates using additional features, such
as estimated outputs produced from parallel solutions of simplified versions of
the CEM for each disjoint period in the input data (e.g. 1 week). The impact of
incorporating dimensionality reduction as part of RPS methods is quantified
through the error in outcomes of the corresponding reduced-space CEM vs. the
full space CEM. Extensive numerical experimentation across various networks and
range of technology and policy scenarios establish the superiority of the
dimensionality-reduction based RPS methods.

wisdom of a crowd or undermines it. This paper addresses this question based on
a naive learning setting in influence systems theory: in our models individuals
evolve their estimates of an unknown truth according to the weighted-average
opinion dynamics. A formal mathematization is provided with rigorous
theoretical analysis. We obtain various conditions for improving, optimizing
and undermining the crowd accuracy, respectively. We prove that if the wisdom
of finite-size group is improved, then the collective estimate converges to the
truth as group size increases, provided individuals' variances are finite. We
show that whether social influence improves or undermines the wisdom is
determined by the social power allocation of the influence system: if the
influence system allocates relatively larger social power to relatively more
accurate individuals, it improves the wisdom; on the contrary, if the influence
system assigns less social power to more accurate individuals, it undermines
the wisdom. At a population level, individuals' susceptibilities to
interpersonal influence and network centralities are both crucial. To improve
the wisdom, more accurate individuals should be less susceptible and have
larger network centralities. Particularly, in democratic influence networks, if
relatively more accurate individuals are relatively less susceptible, the
wisdom is improved; if more accurate individuals are more susceptible, the
wisdom is undermined, which is consistent with the reported empirical evidence.
Our investigation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the role
social influence plays in the emergence of collective wisdom.

these zero modes to one of their boundaries in a manner that is protected
against disorder by the reciprocal-space topology of the lattice's band
structure. Here, we introduce a class of mechanical bilayers as a model system
for designing topologically protected edge modes that couple in-plane
dilational and shearing modes to out-of-plane flexural modes, a paradigm that
we refer to as omnimodal polarization. While these structures exhibit a
high-dimensional design space that makes it difficult to predict the
topological polarization of generic geometries, we are able to identify a
family of mirror-symmetric bilayers that inherit the in-plane modal
localization of their constitutive monolayers whose topological polarization
can be determined analytically. Importantly, the coupling between the layers
results in the emergence of omnimodal polarization, whereby in-plane and
out-of-plane edge modes localize on the same edge. We demonstrate these
theoretical results by fabricating a mirror-symmetric, topologically polarized

manufacturing and confirm this finite-frequency polarization via finite element

attention on understanding vacancy stability and diffusion in refractory-based
MPEAs. Using density-functional theory, we examine vacancy stability and
diffusion barriers in body-centered cubic (Mo0.95W0.05)0.85Ta0.10(TiZr)0.05.
The results in this MPEA show strong dependence on environment, originating
from local lattice distortion associated with charge-transfer between
neighboring atoms that vary with different chemical environments. We find a
correlation between degree of lattice distortion and migration barrier: (Ti,
Zr) with less distortion have lower barriers, while (Mo, W) with larger
distortion have higher barriers, depending up local environments. Under
irradiation, our findings suggest that (Ti, Zr) are significantly more likely
to diffuse than (Mo, W) while Ta shows intermediate effect. As such, material
degradation caused by vacancy diffusion can be controlled by tuning composition
of alloying elements to enhance creep strength at extreme operating
temperatures and harsh conditions.

number of transiting exocomet events ($N$) as a function of the absorption
depth ($AD$) in the light curve follows a power law in the form $dN(AD) \propto
AD^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha=2.3\pm 0.4$. This distribution of absorption depth
leads to a differential comet size distribution proportional to $R^{-\gamma}$,

physics, and can be probed in different ways. If transport occurs via
dissipation-less supercurrents, they manifest as a fractional Josephson effect,
whereas in dissipative transport they can be revealed by the transport
statistics. However, in a regime where supercurrents and lossy currents
coincide, a full understanding of the relationship between these two transport
phenomena is still missing. Moreover, especially for superconducting circuits,
the question of how noninteger quasicharges can be reconciled with charge
quantization is still not fully resolved, and plays an important role for the
circuit dynamics. Here, we aim to unify the above concepts by studying the
system-detector dynamics in terms of a Lindbladian capturing both coherent and
dissipative transport. Charge quantization is here a conserved property of the
detector basis of the Lindbladian, while charge fractionalization is a
topological property of its complex-valued eigenspectrum. We show that already

topological phases, including an open quantum system version of a fractional

computational complexity of simulations operating on such three-dimensional
high-resolution voxel data comprising billions of unknowns induces the need for
algorithmically and numerically efficient solvers. The inability of voxelized
3D geometries to capture smooth material interfaces accurately, along with the
necessity for complexity reduction, motivates a special local coarse-graining
technique called composite voxels [Kabel,M. et al. (2015)]. Composite voxels
condense multiple fine-scale voxels into a single voxel obeying a
theory-inspired constitutive model by employing laminate theory. Composite
voxels enhance local field quality at a modest computational cost. Our
contribution comprises the generalization towards composite boxels (ComBo) that
are nonequiaxed, a feature that can pay off for materials with a preferred
direction. A novel image-based normal detection algorithm is devised which
improves the accuracy by around 30\% against the orientation cf. [Kabel,M. et

studied in detail. An efficient implementation is proposed, and an essential

developed, which improves robustness. Various examples show the efficiency of

quadrupole to the analysis allows for significant improvements on the
determination of the model parameters and specifically on $f$, similarly to the

answering a question), such ability has been largely neglected in multimodal
research, despite the importance of this problem to the usage of VQA in real
settings. In this work, we promote a problem formulation for reliable VQA,
where we prefer abstention over providing an incorrect answer. We first enable
abstention capabilities for several VQA models, and analyze both their
coverage, the portion of questions answered, and risk, the error on that
portion. For that, we explore several abstention approaches. We find that
although the best performing models achieve over 70% accuracy on the VQA v2
dataset, introducing the option to abstain by directly using a model's softmax
scores limits them to answering less than 7.5% of the questions to achieve a
low risk of error (i.e., 1%). This motivates us to utilize a multimodal
selection function to directly estimate the correctness of the predicted
answers, which we show can increase the coverage by, for example, 2.3x from
6.8% to 15.6% at 1% risk. While it is important to analyze both coverage and
risk, these metrics have a trade-off which makes comparing VQA models
challenging. To address this, we also propose an Effective Reliability metric
for VQA that places a larger cost on incorrect answers compared to abstentions.
This new problem formulation, metric, and analysis for VQA provide the
groundwork for building effective and reliable VQA models that have the
self-awareness to abstain if and only if they don't know the answer.

topological charge not only in the simplest (free) case, but also when coupled
to an Abelian gauge field. The implementation of the
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism shows that the effective models
for such a configuration possess a self-dual structure which looks like those
inherent to the gauged sigma models. Therefore, when the $CP(2)$ field is

well-defined Bogomol'nyi bound and a quantized magnetic flux. Further, when the

addition, the analysis verifies that the magnetic impurity contributes to the
BPS potentials and appears in both the models' BPS equations. Next, we
introduce a Gaussian type impurity and solve the self-dual equations via a
finite-difference scheme. The resulting solutions present a nonmonotonic
behavior that flips both the magnetic and electric fields. Finally, we discuss
the topologically trivial solutions in the limit for which the impurity becomes

map of color-guided branch along-with semantic image and sparse depth map is
passed as input to semantic-guided branch for estimating semantic depth. The
depth-guided branch takes sparse, color, and semantic depths to generate the
dense depth map. The color depth, semantic depth, and guided depth are
adaptively fused to produce the output of our proposed three-branch backbone.
In addition, we also propose to apply semantic-aware multi-modal
attention-based fusion block (SAMMAFB) to fuse features between all three
branches. We further use CSPN++ with Atrous convolutions to refine the dense
depth map produced by our three-branch backbone. Extensive experiments show

its corresponding ""roof to footprint"" offset vector. Thus the footprint can be
estimated by translating the predicted roof mask according to the predicted

augmentation module, which can significantly refine the offset vector
prediction by introducing little extra cost. Moreover, a new dataset, Buildings

Low energy consumption and hence a prolonged battery life. They are being used
in smart wearable devices, smart home automation system, beacons and many more
areas. BLE uses pairing mechanisms to achieve a level of peer entity
authentication as well as encryption. Although, there are a set of pairing
mechanisms available but BLE devices having no keyboard or display mechanism
(and hence using the Just Works pairing) are still vulnerable. In this paper,
we propose and implement, a light-weight digital certificate based
authentication mechanism for the BLE devices making use of Just Works model.
The proposed model is an add-on to the already existing pairing mechanism and
therefore can be easily incorporated in the existing BLE stack. To counter the
existing Man-in-The-Middle attack scenario in Just Works pairing (device
spoofing), our proposed model allows the client and peripheral to make use of
the popular Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to establish peer entity
authentication and a secure cryptographic tunnel for communication. We have
also developed a lightweight BLE profiled digital certificate containing the
bare minimum fields required for resource constrained devices, which
significantly reduces the memory (about 90\% reduction) and energy consumption.
We have experimentally evaluated the energy consumption of the device using the
proposed pairing mechanism to demonstrate that the model can be easily deployed
with less changes to the power requirements of the chips. The model has been
formally verified using automatic verification tool for protocol testing.

of the most promising candidates for early practical quantum advantage. We
analyse the requirements for quantitatively reliable quantum simulation beyond
the capabilities of existing classical methods for analogue quantum simulators

primary sources of error in analogue devices and how they propagate after a
quench in studies of the Hubbard or long-range transverse field Ising model, we

We conclude for models that are directly implementable that regimes of

adversaries with access to a machine learning model from extracting information
about individual training points. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient
Descent (DP-SGD), the most popular DP training method for deep learning,
realizes this protection by injecting noise during training. However previous
works have found that DP-SGD often leads to a significant degradation in
performance on standard image classification benchmarks. Furthermore, some
authors have postulated that DP-SGD inherently performs poorly on large models,
since the norm of the noise required to preserve privacy is proportional to the
model dimension. In contrast, we demonstrate that DP-SGD on over-parameterized
models can perform significantly better than previously thought. Combining
careful hyper-parameter tuning with simple techniques to ensure signal
propagation and improve the convergence rate, we obtain a new SOTA without

essential for the accurate alignment of these multi-modal images. However, it

convert the multi-modal registration problem to a mono-modal one. Specifically,
our approach incorporates a discriminator-free translation network to
facilitate the training of the registration network and a patchwise contrastive
loss to encourage the translation network to preserve object shapes.
Furthermore, we propose to replace an adversarial loss, that is widely used in
previous multi-modal image registration methods, with a pixel loss in order to
integrate the output of translation into the target modality. This leads to an
unsupervised method requiring no ground-truth deformation or pairs of aligned

random ensemble, i.e., form a {\it quantum state-design}, representing a
``deeper'' form of quantum thermalization. In this work, we investigate the
dynamical process underlying this novel emergent universality. Leveraging a
space-time duality mapping for one-dimensional quantum circuits, we argue that
the physics of dynamical purification, which arises in the context of monitored
quantum systems, constrains the the projected ensemble's approach towards the
uniform distribution. We prove that absence of dynamical purification in the
space-time dual dynamics (a condition realized in dual-unitary quantum circuits
with appropriate initial states and final measurement bases) generically yields
exact state-designs for all moments $k$ at the same time, extending previous
rigorous results [Ho and Choi, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 060601 (2022)].
Conversely, we show that, departing from these conditions, dynamical
purification can lead to a separation of timescales between the formation of a
quantum state-design for moment $k=1$ (regular thermalization) and for high
moments $k\gg 1$ (deep thermalization). Our results suggest that the projected
ensemble can probe nuanced features of quantum dynamics inaccessible to regular
thermalization, such as quantum information scrambling.

and we provide redshift estimates for the remaining 1,589 single broad-line AGN
with no cross matched spectral redshifts from SDSS DR14Q. The redshift range of
the AGN catalog is 0.25 < z < 4.32, with a median of z = 2.1. The bolometric
luminosity range is 10^9-10^14 Lsun with a median of 10^12 Lsun. The median
r-band magnitude of the AGN is 21.6 mag, with 34% of the AGN have r > 22.5, and
2.6% reaching the detection limit at r ~ 26 mag of the deepest imaging surveys

and outside observed CH boundaries. The polar modified and unmodified maps are
used to drive Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) models of the corona and solar wind (SW).
The WSA predicted CHs are compared with the observations, and SW predictions at
the WIND and Ulysses spacecraft are also used to provide context for the new
polar modified maps. We find that modifications of the polar flux never worsen
and typically improve both the CH and SW predictions. We also confirm the
importance of the choice of the domain over which WSA generates the coronal
magnetic field solution but find that solutions optimized for one location in
the heliosphere can worsen predictions at other locations. Finally, we
investigate the importance of low-latitude (i.e., active region) magnetic
fields in setting the boundary of polar CHs, determining that they have at
least as much impact as the polar fields themselves.

our algorithm is able to asymptotically exactly estimate the measurement noise.

Based on this finding, we propose KING, which generates safety-critical driving

a minimal representation of the IFCs. Our approach is tailored toward accurate
predictions of thermal conductivity, thus requiring knowledge of both harmonic
and anharmonic IFCs by matching second- and third-order displacement
derivatives, whereas second-order strain derivatives are needed for determining
the elastic constants. We demonstrate this approach as an efficient and robust
manner in which to train EIPs for predicting phonons and related properties, by
optimizing parameters of an embedded-atom method potential for ThO$_2$, which
is used as a model system for fluorite oxides. Our ID-trained EIP provides
thermophysical properties in great agreement with DFT, and outperforms
previously widely utilized EIP for ThO$_2$ in phonon dispersion and thermal

select phonon modes have a strong dependence on the Hubbard $U$, whereas
magnetic ordering has only a small influence overall. We perform measurements

contribution to the W-boson mass via one-loop RG effects, that is comparable to
the tree-level contribution of the much more strongly constrained operators

that, without any prior knowledge, if one can explore the full quantum state

one cannot explore the full state space but all operations are approximately
known and noise in Clifford gates is gate-independent, we find an efficient
algorithm for learning all operations up to a single unlearnable parameter
characterizing the fidelity of the initial state. For learning a noise channel
on Clifford gates to a fixed accuracy, our algorithm uses quadratically fewer
experiments than previously known protocols. Under more general conditions, the
true description of the noise can be unlearnable; for example, we prove that no
benchmarking protocol can learn gate-dependent Pauli noise on Clifford+T gates
even under perfect state preparation and measurement. Despite not being able to
learn the noise, we show that a noisy quantum computer that performs entangled
measurements on multiple copies of an unknown state can yield a large advantage

measures individual copies and then processes the measurement data using a

revolution, with various synthetic quantum matter platforms realizing evermore
exotic condensed matter and particle physics phenomena at high levels of
precision and control. The implementation of gauge theories on modern quantum
simulators is especially appealing due to three main reasons: (i) it offers a
new probe of high-energy physics on low-energy tabletop devices, (ii) it allows
exploring condensed matter phenomena that are prominent in gauge theories even
without a direct connection to high-energy physics, and (iii) it serves as a
banner of experimental benchmarking given the plethora of local constraints
arising from the gauge symmetry that need to be programmed and controlled. In
order to faithfully model gauge-theory phenomena on a quantum simulator,
stabilizing the underlying gauge symmetry is essential. In this brief review,
we outline recently developed experimentally feasible methods introduced by us
that have shown, in numerical and experimental benchmarks, reliable
stabilization of quantum-simulator implementations of gauge theories. We
explain the mechanism behind these \textit{linear gauge protection} schemes,
and illustrate their power in protecting salient features such as gauge
invariance, disorder-free localization, quantum many-body scars, and other
phenomena of topical interest. We then discuss their application in experiments
based on Rydberg atoms, superconducting qubits, and in particular ultracold
neutral atoms in optical superlattices. We hope this review will illustrate
some facets of the exciting progress in stabilization of gauge symmetry and in
gauge-theory quantum simulation in general.

causes quenching on a population scale is lacking. Studies have shown that
luminous AGN are preferentially located in gas-rich and star-forming galaxies,
an observation that has sometimes been suggested to be in tension with a
negative AGN feedback picture. We investigate three of the current cosmological
simulations (IllustrisTNG, EAGLE and SIMBA) along with post-processed models
for molecular hydrogen gas masses and perform similar tests to those used by
observers. We find that the simulations predict: (i) no strong negative trends
between AGN luminosity and molecular gas fraction or sSFR; (ii) both
high-luminosity ($L_{bol}>10^{44}$ erg/s) and high-Eddington ratio (>1%) AGN
are preferentially located in galaxies with high molecular gas fractions and
sSFR; and (iii) that the gas-depleted and quenched fractions of AGN host
galaxies are lower than a control sample of non-active galaxies. These three
findings are in qualitative agreement with observational samples at $z=0$ and
$z=2$ and show that such results are not in tension with the presence of strong
AGN feedback, which all simulations we employ require to produce realistic
massive galaxies. However, we also find quantifiable differences between
predictions from the simulations, which could allow us to observationally test
the different subgrid feedback models.

also a pressing need to develop methodologies that investigate how to transform
atmospheric compositions into planetary formation inferences. In this study we
summarize the complexities and uncertainties of state-of-the-art planet
formation models and how they influence planetary atmospheric compositions. We
introduce a methodology that explores the effect of different formation model

to the directly imaged planet HR 8799e. Based on its atmospheric composition,
this planet may have migrated significantly during its formation. We show that
including the chemical evolution of the protoplanetary disk leads to a reduced
need for migration. Moreover, we find that pebble accretion can reproduce the
planet's composition, but some of our tested setups lead to too low atmospheric
metallicities, even when considering that evaporating pebbles may enrich the
disk gas. We conclude that the definitive inversion from atmospheric abundances

we still rely to a large degree on a simplified energy conservation equation.
Unfortunately, this equation contains a theoretically rather poorly constrained
efficiency parameter ($\alpha_{\mathrm{CE}}$) and, even worse, it is unclear if
energy sources in addition to orbital energy (such as recombination energy)
contribute to the envelope ejection process. In previous works we reconstructed
the evolution of observed populations of post common envelope binaries (PCEBs)
consisting of white dwarfs with main sequence star companions and found
indications that the efficiency is rather small
($\alpha_{\mathrm{CE}}\simeq0.2-0.3$) and that extra energy sources are only
required in very few cases. Here we used the same reconstruction tool to
investigate the evolutionary history of a sample of observed PCEBs with brown
dwarf companions. In contrast to previous works, we found that the evolution of
observationally well characterized PCEBs with brown dwarf companions can be
understood assuming a low common envelope efficiency
($\alpha_{\mathrm{CE}}=0.24-0.41$), similar to that required to understand
PCEBs with main sequence star companions, and that contributions from
recombination energy are not required. We conclude that the vast majority of

spectroscopic extinction curves for the first time, enabling us to investigate
the extinction at wavelengths where it is usually only measured in broad
photometric bands. We use IRTF/SpeX spectra of a sample of reddened and

sample spans A(V) values from 0.78 to 5.65 and R(V) values from 2.43 to 5.33.
We confirm that the NIR extinction curves are well fit by a power law, with
indices and amplitudes differing from sight line to sight line. Our average
diffuse NIR extinction curve can be represented by a single power law with
index $\alpha = 1.7$, but because of the sight line-to-sight line variations,
the shape of any average curve will depend on the parental sample. We find that
most of the variation in our sample can be linked to the ratio of
total-to-selective extinction R(V), a rough measurement of the average dust
grain size. Two sight lines in our sample clearly show the ice extinction
feature at 3 $\mu$m, which can be fitted by a modified Drude profile. We find
tentative ice detections with slightly over 3$\sigma$ significance in two other

distinguish by examining their Floquet spectra. We formulate a toy model, based

an efficient (but computationally expensive) exact calculation of analytic

quickly and accurately predicted, and will speed-up the identification of
promising geometries for spintronic applications. While machine-learning
approaches to many-body interactions have largely been limited to exact
solutions of complex models at very small scales, this work establishes that
they can be successfully applied at very large scales at mean-field levels of

extracted from the analysis performed by the Code for Stellar properties
Heuristic Assignment (\textsc{CoSHA}) from the MaStar stellar library. It
follows that finding SNAs in other galaxies consist in matching, in a $\chi^2$
sense, the SN reference spectrum across the optical extent of the observed
galaxies. We apply this procedure to a selection of CALIFA galaxies, by
requiring a close to face-on projection, relative isolation and non-AGN. We
explore how the local and global properties of the SNAs (stellar age,
metallicity, dust extinction, mass-to-light ratio, stellar surface mass and
star-formation densities and galactocentric distance) and their corresponding
host galaxies (morphological type, total stellar mass, star-formation rate,
effective radius) compare with those of the SN and the Milky Way (MW). We find
that SNAs are located preferentially in S(B)a~--~S(B)c galaxies, in a ring-like
structure, which radii seems to scale with the galaxy size. Despite the known
sources of systematics and errors, {most} properties present a considerable
agreement with the literature on the SN. We conclude that the solar
neighborhood is relatively common in our sample of SNAs. Our results warrants a
systematic exploration of correlations among the physical properties of the
SNAs and their host galaxies. We reckon that our method should inform current
models of the galactic habitable zone in our MW and other galaxies.

atmospheres have thus far focused on either radiative transfer or
hydrodynamics. In this study, we couple the two processes by introducing
ultraviolet and infrared radiation to a turbulent boundary layer model. We also
test the effect of different vertical temperature profiles on atmospheric
dynamics. Results from the model show that UV radiation affects the atmosphere
much more than IR. UV heating and cooling work together to produce a
horizontally isothermal atmosphere away from the sub-stellar point regardless
of the vertical temperature profile. We also find that stronger temperature
inversions induce stronger winds and hence cool the atmosphere. Our simulated

properties (e.g., velocity, conductivity) from surface-based geophysical
measurements (e.g., seismic, electric/magnetic (EM) data). The problems are
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) like the wave or Maxwell's
equations. Solving geophysical inversion problems is challenging due to the
ill-posedness and high computational cost. To alleviate those issues, recent
studies leverage deep neural networks to learn the inversion mappings from
measurements to the property directly. In this paper, we show that such a
mapping can be well modeled by a very shallow (but not wide) network with only
five layers. This is achieved based on our new finding of an intriguing
property: a near-linear relationship between the input and output, after
applying integral transform in high dimensional space. In particular, when
dealing with the inversion from seismic data to subsurface velocity governed by
a wave equation, the integral results of velocity with Gaussian kernels are
linearly correlated to the integral of seismic data with sine kernels.
Furthermore, this property can be easily turned into a light-weight
encoder-decoder network for inversion. The encoder contains the integration of
seismic data and the linear transformation without need for fine-tuning. The
decoder only consists of a single transformer block to reverse the integral of
velocity. Experiments show that this interesting property holds for two
geophysics inversion problems over four different datasets. Compared to much
deeper InversionNet, our method achieves comparable accuracy, but consumes
significantly fewer parameters.

harbor a variety of unresolved mysteries. Two of the biggest are the origin of
the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the existence and nature of dark
matter. In the present thesis, the author addresses these topics in various
ways. The first part of the thesis is concerned with cosmological first-order
phase transitions that may have occurred shortly after the Big Bang. Such
transitions proceed via the nucleation and expansion of true vacuum bubbles and
give rise to a rich phenomenology. The author suggests a mechanism to
simultaneously explain the baryon asymmetry and dark matter, based on the
out-of-equilibrium dynamics at the boundary of a dark phase transition with
large order parameter. The same class of phase transitions can, in the
parameter regime of small dark matter Yukawa couplings, lead to the production
of primordial black holes via the compression of the plasma in shrinking false
vacuum regions, as the author demonstrates with a sophisticated numerical
simulation. In a third project regarding cosmological phase transitions, the
author investigates the possibility of sub-MeV hidden sectors that are
decoupled from the remaining plasma and cold enough to be reconciled with
cosmological constraints, but at the same time give rise to a detectable
gravitational-wave spectrum produced during bubble collisions. In the second
part of the thesis, the author assesses the prospects for new physics searches
at the DUNE near detector, focusing on the DUNE-PRISM concept, which suggests
consecutive measurements at different on- and off-axis positions. This setup
achieves improved signal-to-background ratios and reduces systematic

practice as each contrast provides complementary information. However, the
availability of each imaging contrast may vary amongst patients, which poses
challenges to radiologists and automated image analysis algorithms. A general
approach for tackling this problem is missing data imputation, which aims to
synthesize the missing contrasts from existing ones. While several
convolutional neural networks (CNN) based algorithms have been proposed, they
suffer from the fundamental limitations of CNN models, such as the requirement
for fixed numbers of input and output channels, the inability to capture
long-range dependencies, and the lack of interpretability. In this work, we
formulate missing data imputation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem
and propose a multi-contrast multi-scale Transformer (MMT), which can take any
subset of input contrasts and synthesize those that are missing. MMT consists
of a multi-scale Transformer encoder that builds hierarchical representations
of inputs combined with a multi-scale Transformer decoder that generates the
outputs in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The proposed multi-contrast Swin
Transformer blocks can efficiently capture intra- and inter-contrast
dependencies for accurate image synthesis. Moreover, MMT is inherently
interpretable as it allows us to understand the importance of each input
contrast in different regions by analyzing the in-built attention maps of
Transformer blocks in the decoder. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that MMT outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

on graphs -- the FO model checking problem (parameterized by the respective FO
formula), is well-understood on so-called sparse graph classes, but much less
understood on hereditary dense graph classes. Regarding the latter, a recent
concept of twin-width [Bonnet et al., FOCS 2020] appears to be very useful. For
instance, the question of these authors [CGTA 2019] about where is the exact
limit of fixed-parameter tractability of FO model checking on permutation
graphs has been answered by Bonnet et al. in 2020 quite easily, using the newly
introduced twin-width. We prove that such exact characterization of hereditary
subclasses with tractable FO model checking naturally extends from permutation
to circle graphs (the intersection graphs of chords in a circle). Namely, we
prove that under usual complexity assumptions, FO model checking of a
hereditary class of circle graphs is in FPT if and only if the class excludes
some permutation graph. We also prove a similar excluded-subgraphs
characterization for hereditary classes of interval graphs with FO model
checking in FPT, which concludes the line a research of interval classes with
tractable FO model checking started in [Ganian et al., ICALP 2013]. The
mathematical side of the presented characterizations -- about when subclasses
of the classes of circle and permutation graphs have bounded twin-width,
moreover extends to so-called bounded perturbations of these classes.

words in free text. Named Entities can also be multi-word expressions where the
additional I-O-B annotation information helps label them during the NER
annotation process. While English and European languages have considerable
annotated data for the NER task, Indian languages lack on that front -- both in
terms of quantity and following annotation standards. This paper releases a
significantly sized standard-abiding Hindi NER dataset containing 109,146
sentences and 2,220,856 tokens, annotated with 11 tags. We discuss the dataset
statistics in all their essential detail and provide an in-depth analysis of
the NER tag-set used with our data. The statistics of tag-set in our dataset
show a healthy per-tag distribution, especially for prominent classes like
Person, Location and Organisation. Since the proof of resource-effectiveness is
in building models with the resource and testing the model on benchmark data
and against the leader-board entries in shared tasks, we do the same with the
aforesaid data. We use different language models to perform the sequence
labelling task for NER and show the efficacy of our data by performing a
comparative evaluation with models trained on another dataset available for the
Hindi NER task. Our dataset helps achieve a weighted F1 score of 88.78 with all
the tags and 92.22 when we collapse the tag-set, as discussed in the paper. To
the best of our knowledge, no available dataset meets the standards of volume
(amount) and variability (diversity), as far as Hindi NER is concerned. We fill
this gap through this work, which we hope will significantly help NLP for
Hindi. We release this dataset with our code and models at

  Differential Equations","10 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  This paper introduces a novel two-stream deep model based on graph
convolutional network (GCN) architecture and feed-forward neural networks
(FFNN) for learning the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations
(PDEs). The model aims at incorporating both graph and grid input
representations using two streams corresponding to GCN and FFNN models,
respectively. Each stream layer receives and processes its own input
representation. As opposed to FFNN which receives a grid-like structure, the
GCN stream layer operates on graph input data where the neighborhood
information is incorporated through the adjacency matrix of the graph. In this
way, the proposed GCN-FFNN model learns from two types of input
representations, i.e. grid and graph data, obtained via the discretization of
the PDE domain. The GCN-FFNN model is trained in two phases. In the first
phase, the model parameters of each stream are trained separately. Both streams
employ the same error function to adjust their parameters by enforcing the
models to satisfy the given PDE as well as its initial and boundary conditions
on grid or graph collocation (training) data. In the second phase, the learned
parameters of two-stream layers are frozen and their learned representation
solutions are fed to fully connected layers whose parameters are learned using
the previously used error function. The learned GCN-FFNN model is tested on
test data located both inside and outside the PDE domain. The obtained
numerical results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed
GCN-FFNN model over individual GCN and FFNN models on 1D-Burgers,
1D-Schr\""odinger, 2D-Burgers and 2D-Schr\""odinger equations.

Given a dataset with input-label pairs, ls learns to split this dataset so that
predictors trained on the training split cannot generalize to the testing
split. This performance gap suggests that the testing split is
under-represented in the dataset, which is a signal of potential bias.
Identifying non-generalizable splits is challenging since we have no
annotations about the bias. In this work, we show that the prediction
correctness of each example in the testing split can be used as a source of
weak supervision: generalization performance will drop if we move examples that
are predicted correctly away from the testing split, leaving only those that
are mis-predicted. ls is task-agnostic and can be applied to any supervised
learning problem, ranging from natural language understanding and image
classification to molecular property prediction. Empirical results show that ls
is able to generate astonishingly challenging splits that correlate with
human-identified biases. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining robust
learning algorithms (such as group DRO) with splits identified by ls enables
automatic de-biasing. Compared to previous state-of-the-art, we substantially

unitary gate parameters without taking into account the changes induced by

the parameters of a unitary gate by drawing from a beta distribution. The
hyperparameters of the beta distribution are estimated from the data. To
further prevent barren plateau during training we add a novel perturbation at

that relies on a Gaussian Process regression (GPR) model to approximate the
objective function and an acquisition function to suggest candidate points. It
is well-known that BO does not scale well for high-dimensional problems because
the GPR model requires substantially more data points to achieve sufficient
accuracy and acquisition optimization becomes computationally expensive in high
dimensions. Several recent works aim at addressing these issues, e.g., methods
that implement online variable selection or conduct the search on a
lower-dimensional sub-manifold of the original search space. Advancing our
previous work of PCA-BO that learns a linear sub-manifold, this paper proposes
a novel kernel PCA-assisted BO (KPCA-BO) algorithm, which embeds a non-linear
sub-manifold in the search space and performs BO on this sub-manifold.
Intuitively, constructing the GPR model on a lower-dimensional sub-manifold
helps improve the modeling accuracy without requiring much more data from the
objective function. Also, our approach defines the acquisition function on the
lower-dimensional sub-manifold, making the acquisition optimization more
manageable.
  We compare the performance of KPCA-BO to a vanilla BO and to PCA-BO on the
multi-modal problems of the COCO/BBOB benchmark suite. Empirical results show
that KPCA-BO outperforms BO in terms of convergence speed on most test
problems, and this benefit becomes more significant when the dimensionality
increases. For the 60D functions, KPCA-BO achieves better results than PCA-BO
for many test cases. Compared to the vanilla BO, it efficiently reduces the CPU
time required to train the GPR model and to optimize the acquisition function
compared to the vanilla BO.

to the source document, but in reality, there is a large portion of entities in
the gold reference targets that are not directly in the source. In this work,
we show that these entities are not aberrations, but they instead require
utilizing external world knowledge to infer reasoning paths from entities in
the source. We show that by utilizing an external knowledge base, we can
improve the faithfulness of summaries without simply making them more
extractive, and additionally, we show that external knowledge bases linked from

underlying assumptions and perspectives. PL optimization with the REINFORCE
algorithm can be used for optimizing black-box objective functions over
permutations. In particular, it can be used for optimizing fairness measures.
However, though effective for queries with a moderate number of repeating
sessions, PL optimization has room for improvement for queries with a small
number of repeating sessions.
  In this paper, we present a novel way of representing permutation
distributions, based on the notion of permutation graphs. Similar to PL, our
distribution representation, called PPG, can be used for black-box optimization
of fairness. Different from PL, where pointwise logits are used as the
distribution parameters, in PPG pairwise inversion probabilities together with
a reference permutation construct the distribution. As such, the reference
permutation can be set to the best sampled permutation regarding the objective
function, making PPG suitable for both deterministic and stochastic rankings.
Our experiments show that PPG, while comparable to PL for larger session
repetitions (i.e., stochastic ranking), improves over PL for optimizing
fairness metrics for queries with one session (i.e., deterministic ranking).
Additionally, when accurate utility estimations are available, e.g., in tabular
models, the performance of PPG in fairness optimization is significantly
boosted compared to lower quality utility estimations from a learning to rank
model, leading to a large performance gap with PL. Finally, the pairwise
probabilities make it possible to impose pairwise constraints such as ""item
$d_1$ should always be ranked higher than item $d_2$."" Such constraints can be
used to simultaneously optimize the fairness metric and control another
objective such as ranking performance.

strong abilities in capturing long-term dependencies, they still suffer from
two key limitations. First, canonical self attention has a quadratic complexity
w.r.t. the input time series length, thus falling short in efficiency. Second,
different variables' time series often have distinct temporal dynamics, which
existing studies fail to capture, as they use the same model parameter space,
e.g., projection matrices, for all variables' time series, thus falling short
in accuracy. To ensure high efficiency and accuracy, we propose Triformer, a

novel patch attention with linear complexity. When stacking multiple layers of
the patch attentions, a triangular structure is proposed such that the layer
sizes shrink exponentially, thus maintaining linear complexity. (ii)
Variable-specific parameters: we propose a light-weight method to enable
distinct sets of model parameters for different variables' time series to

media agencies playing the role of intermediaries between advertisers and
platforms selling ad slots. When a group of competing advertisers is managed by
a common agency, many forms of collusion, such as bid rigging, can be
implemented by coordinating bidding strategies, dramatically increasing
advertisers' value. We study the problem of finding bids and monetary transfers
maximizing the utility of a group of colluders, under GSP and VCG mechanisms.
First, we introduce an abstract bid optimization problem -- called weighted
utility problem (WUP) -- , which is useful in proving our results. We show that
the utilities of bidding strategies are related to the length of paths in a
directed acyclic weighted graph, whose structure and weights depend on the
mechanism under study. This allows us to solve WUP in polynomial time by
finding a shortest path of the graph. Next, we switch to our original problem,
focusing on two settings that differ for the incentives they allow for.
Incentive constraints ensure that colluders do not leave the agency, and they
can be enforced by implementing monetary transfers between the agency and the
advertisers. In particular, we study the arbitrary transfers setting, where any
kind of monetary transfer to and from the advertisers is allowed, and the more
realistic limited liability setting, in which no advertiser can be paid by the
agency. In the former, we cast the problem as a WUP instance and solve it by
our graph-based algorithm, while, in the latter, we formulate it as a linear
program with exponentially-many variables efficiently solvable by applying the
ellipsoid algorithm to its dual. This requires to solve a suitable separation
problem in polynomial time, which can be done by reducing it to a WUP instance.

is to formally define the problem of learning and generalization with an

propose variation regularization (VR) which reduces variation of the feature

signal-to-noise $q$) does not behave as expected, which can potentially bias
cosmological inference. In particular, the observable becomes biased with
respect to its theoretical prediction and displays a variance that also differs
from its predicted value. We propose an iterative MMF (iMMF) approach designed
to mitigate these effects. In this approach, after a first standard MMF step,
the noise power spectra are reestimated by masking the detections from the
data, delivering an updated iterative cluster catalogue. Applying our iMMF to
our \textit{Planck}-like mock observations, we find that the aforementioned
effects are completely suppressed. This leads to a signal-to-noise gain
relative to the standard MMF, with more significant detections and a higher
number of them, and to a cluster observable with the expected theoretical
properties, thus eliminating any potential biases in the cosmological
constraints.

matter abundance of the universe. With its extremely small mass ($\ll
1\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$), axion dark matter interacts as a classical field rather
than a particle. Its coupling to photons leads to a modification of Maxwell's
equations that can be measured with extremely sensitive readout circuits.
DMRadio-m$^3$ is a next-generation search for axion dark matter below
$1\,\mu$eV using a $>4$ T static magnetic field, a coaxial inductive pickup, a
tunable LC resonator, and a DC-SQUID readout. It is designed to search for QCD
axion dark matter over the range $20\,\mathrm{neV}\lesssim m_ac^2\lesssim
800\,\mathrm{neV}$ ($5\,\mathrm{MHz}<\nu<200\,\mathrm{MHz}$). The primary
science goal aims to achieve DFSZ sensitivity above $m_ac^2\approx 120$ neV (30
MHz), with a secondary science goal of probing KSVZ axions down to
$m_ac^2\approx40\,\mathrm{neV}$ (10 MHz).

extract the true causal effect of interventions on outcomes and are by design

can be illustrated using the Structural Causal Model (SCM), and do-calculus can
be employed to estimate the causal effects. Pragmatic clinical trials (PCT)
fall between these two ends of the trial design spectra and are thus hard to

by proposing a generalized representation of PCT under the rubric of structural
causal models (SCM). We discuss different analysis techniques commonly employed
in PCT using the proposed graphical model, such as intention-to-treat,

self-similar rough surfaces, in which $f\equiv \log I$ plays the role of the
main field, where $I$ is the intensity of the received visible light. By
simulating the light scattering based on a coarse-grained phenomenological
model in a two-dimensional cloud, we argue the possible connection of $I$ to
the actual cloud thickness. Although in the vertical incident light $f$ is
proportional to the cloud thickness, in the general case it is complected. We
study the statistical properties of observational data for $f$ with a focus on
the conventional exponents of this scale-invariant rough surface. By
calculating the roughness exponents, and comparing them with other exponents
like the fractal dimension of loops, the distribution function of the radius of
gyration and loop lengths, and the exponent of the green function, we prove
that this surface is unconventional in the sense that it is the non-Gaussian
self-affine random surface which violates the Kondev hyper-scaling relations.

  Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS 2022)",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning is a private-by-design distributed learning paradigm where
clients train local models on their own data before a central server aggregates
their local updates to compute a global model. Depending on the aggregation
method used, the local updates are either the gradients or the weights of local
learning models. Recent reconstruction attacks apply a gradient inversion
optimization on the gradient update of a single minibatch to reconstruct the
private data used by clients during training. As the state-of-the-art
reconstruction attacks solely focus on single update, realistic adversarial
scenarios are overlooked, such as observation across multiple updates and
updates trained from multiple mini-batches. A few studies consider a more
challenging adversarial scenario where only model updates based on multiple
mini-batches are observable, and resort to computationally expensive simulation
to untangle the underlying samples for each local step. In this paper, we
propose AGIC, a novel Approximate Gradient Inversion Attack that efficiently
and effectively reconstructs images from both model or gradient updates, and
across multiple epochs. In a nutshell, AGIC (i) approximates gradient updates
of used training samples from model updates to avoid costly simulation
procedures, (ii) leverages gradient/model updates collected from multiple
epochs, and (iii) assigns increasing weights to layers with respect to the
neural network structure for reconstruction quality. We extensively evaluate
AGIC on three datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Our results show that
AGIC increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to 50% compared to
two representative state-of-the-art gradient inversion attacks. Furthermore,
AGIC is faster than the state-of-the-art simulation based attack, e.g., it is
5x faster when attacking FedAvg with 8 local steps in between model updates.

express arbitrary roots or fractional powers of single-qubit gates, and to use
such fractional powers as generators for algebras that combine these fractional
input signals, behaving as a kind of nonlinear addition. The method works by
connecting several well-known equivalences. The group of all single-qubit gates
is $U(2)$, the unitary transformations of $C^2$. Using an appropriate phase
multiplier, every element of $U(2)$ can be mapped to a corresponding element of
$SU(2)$ with unit determinant, whose quantum mechanical behavior is identical.
The group $SU(2)$ is isomorphic to the group of unit quaternions. Powers and
roots of unit quaternions can be constructed by extending de Moivre's theorem
for roots of complex numbers to the quaternions by selecting a preferred square
root of -1. Using this chain of equivalences, for any single-qubit gate $A$ and
real exponent $k$, a gate $B$ can be predictably constructed so that $B^k = A$.
Different fractions generated in this way can be combined by connecting the
individually rotated qubits to a common 'sum' qubit using 2-qubit CNOT gates.
Examples of such algebras are explored including those generated by roots of
the quaternion $k$ (which corresponds to and $X$-rotation of the Bloch sphere),
the quaternion $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(i + k)$ (which corresponds to the Hadamard
gate), and a mixture of these. One of the goals of this research is to develop
quantum versions of classical components such as the classifier ensembles and
activation functions used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. An
example application for text classification is presented, which uses fractional
rotation gates to represent classifier weights, and classifies new input by
using CNOT gates to collect the appropriate classifier weights in a
topic-scoring qubit.

direction, are one of the more striking observations of Parker Solar Probe
(PSP) thus far in its mission. While their precise production mechanisms are
still unknown, the two main theories are via interchange reconnection events
and in-situ generation. In this work density and abundance variations of alpha
particles are studied inside and outside individual switchbacks. We find no
consistent compositional differences in the alpha particle abundance ratio,
$n_{\alpha p}$, inside vs outside, nor do we observe any signature when
separating the switchbacks according to $V_{\alpha p}/V_{pw}$, the ratio of
alpha-proton differential speed to the wave phase speed (speed the switchback
is travelling). We argue these measurements cannot be used to rule in favour of
one production mechanism over the other, due to the distance between PSP and
the postulated interchange reconnection events. In addition we examine the 3D
velocity fluctuations of protons and alpha particles within individual
switchbacks. While switchbacks are always associated with increases in proton
velocity, alpha velocities may be enhanced, unchanged, or decrease. This is due
to the interplay between $V_{pw}$ and $V_{\alpha p}$, with the Alfv\'enic
motion of the alpha particles vanishing as the difference $|V_{pw} - V_{\alpha
p}|$ decreases. We show how the Alfv\'enic motion of both the alphas and the
protons through switchbacks can be understood as approximately rigid arm
rotation about the location of the wave frame, and illustrate that the wave
frame can therefore be estimated using particle measurements alone, via sphere
fitting.

of research finds that scientific contributions are evaluated differently
depending on the gender of the author, with women tending to receive fewer

research also suggests that these gender gaps are visible even under blinded
review, wherein the evaluator is not aware of the gender of the author. In this
article, we consider whether gender differences in writing styles -- how men

gaps. We ground our investigation in a previously established framework for
characterizing the linguistic style of written text, which distinguishes
between two sets of features -- informational (i.e., features that emphasize
facts) and involved (i.e., features that emphasize relationships). Using a
large, matched sample of academic papers and patents, we find significant
differences in writing style by gender; women use more involved features in
their writing, a pattern that holds universally across fields. The magnitude of
the effect varies across fields, with larger gender differences observed in the
social sciences and arts humanities and smaller gaps in the physical sciences
and technology. Subsequently, we show that gender differences in writing style
may have parallels in reading preferences; papers and patents with more
informational features tend to be cited more by men, while those with more
involved features tend to be cited more by women, even after controlling for
the gender of the author, inventor, and patent attorney. Our findings suggest
that formal written text is not devoid of personal character, which could

both for their application to a variety of biological and chemical phenomena,
and for their distinct features in terms of propagation speed and novel
instabilities not present in classical two-species reaction-diffusion systems.
We explore the onset of diffusive instabilities and resulting pattern formation
for such systems. Starting with a rather general formulation of the problem, we
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the Turing and wave
instabilities in such systems, thereby classifying parameter spaces for which
these diffusive instabilities occur. We find that the additional temporal terms
do not strongly modify the Turing patterns which form or parameters which admit
them, but only their regions of existence. This is in contrast to the case of
additional space derivatives, where past work has shown that resulting
patterned structures are sensitive to second-order cross-diffusion and
first-order advection. We also show that additional temporal terms are
necessary for the emergence of spatiotemporal patterns under the wave
instability. We find that such wave instabilities exist for parameters which
are mutually exclusive to those parameters leading to stationary Turing
patterns. This implies that wave instabilities may occur in cases where the
activator diffuses faster than the inhibitor, leading to routes to spatial

  Modeling Strain Localization",,,,,"cs.CE cs.LG cs.NA math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modeling the localized intensive deformation in a damaged solid requires
highly refined discretization for accurate prediction, which significantly
increases the computational cost. Although adaptive model refinement can be
employed for enhanced effectiveness, it is cumbersome for the traditional
mesh-based methods to perform while modeling the evolving localizations. In
this work, neural network-enhanced reproducing kernel particle method (NN-RKPM)
is proposed, where the location, orientation, and shape of the solution
transition near a localization is automatically captured by the NN
approximation via a block-level neural network optimization. The weights and
biases in the blocked parametrization network control the location and
orientation of the localization. The designed basic four-kernel NN block is
capable of capturing a triple junction or a quadruple junction topological
pattern, while more complicated localization topological patters are captured
by the superposition of multiple four-kernel NN blocks. The standard RK
approximation is then utilized to approximate the smooth part of the solution,
which permits a much coarser discretization than the high-resolution
discretization needed to capture sharp solution transitions with the
conventional methods. A regularization of the neural network approximation is
additionally introduced for discretization-independent material responses. The
effectiveness of the proposed NN-RKPM is verified by a series of numerical
verifications.

co-authorships, are ubiquitous; and they are naturally represented as a stream
of hyperedges. Despite their broad potential applications, anomaly detection in
hypergraphs (i.e., sets of hyperedges) has received surprisingly little
attention, compared to that in graphs. While it is tempting to reduce
hypergraphs to graphs and apply existing graph-based methods, according to our
experiments, taking higher-order structures of hypergraphs into consideration
is worthwhile. We propose HashNWalk, an incremental algorithm that detects
anomalies in a stream of hyperedges. It maintains and updates a constant-size
summary of the structural and temporal information about the stream. Using the
summary, which is the form of a proximity matrix, HashNWalk measures the
anomalousness of each new hyperedge as it appears. HashNWalk is (a) Fast: it
processes each hyperedge in near real-time and billions of hyperedges within a
few hours, (b) Space Efficient: the size of the maintained summary is a
predefined constant, (c) Effective: it successfully detects anomalous
hyperedges in real-world hypergraphs.

the principles underlying trustworthy AI, with insufficient attention paid to
how people develop trust. Given that AI systems differ in their level of
trustworthiness, two open questions come to the fore: how should AI
trustworthiness be responsibly communicated to ensure appropriate and equitable
trust judgments by different users, and how can we protect users from deceptive
attempts to earn their trust? We draw from communication theories and
literature on trust in technologies to develop a conceptual model called MATCH,
which describes how trustworthiness is communicated in AI systems through
trustworthiness cues and how those cues are processed by people to make trust
judgments. Besides AI-generated content, we highlight transparency and
interaction as AI systems' affordances that present a wide range of
trustworthiness cues to users. By bringing to light the variety of users'
cognitive processes to make trust judgments and their potential limitations, we
urge technology creators to make conscious decisions in choosing reliable
trustworthiness cues for target users and, as an industry, to regulate this
space and prevent malicious use. Towards these goals, we define the concepts of
warranted trustworthiness cues and expensive trustworthiness cues, and propose
a checklist of requirements to help technology creators identify appropriate
cues to use. We present a hypothetical use case to illustrate how practitioners
can use MATCH to design AI systems responsibly, and discuss future directions
for research and industry efforts aimed at promoting responsible trust in AI.

of a common monoid and, roughly speaking, $S$ has an action on the monoid
completion $U^1$ that is suitably compatible with the product in the
over-monoid.
  The semigroups encapsulated by the action pair construction include many
natural classes such as inverse semigroups and (left) restriction semigroups,
as well as many important concrete examples such as transformational wreath
products, linear monoids, (partial) endomorphism monoids of independence
algebras, and the singular ideals of many of these. Action pairs provide a
unified framework for systematically studying such semigroups, within which we
build a suite of tools to ensure a comprehensive understanding of them. We then
apply our abstract results to many special cases of interest.
  The first part of the paper constitutes a detailed structural analysis of
semigroups arising from action pairs. We show that any such semigroup $US$ is a
quotient of a semidirect product $U\rtimes S$, and we classify all congruences
on semidirect products that correspond to action pairs. We also prove several
covering and embedding theorems, each of which naturally extends celebrated
results of McAlister on proper (a.k.a. $E$-unitary) inverse semigroups.
  The second part of the paper concerns presentations by generators and
relations for semigroups arising from action pairs. We develop a substantial
body of general results and techniques that allow us to build presentations for
$US$ out of presentations for the constituents $U$ and $S$ in many cases, and
then apply these to several examples, including those listed above. Due to the
broad applicability of the action pair construction, many results in the
literature are special cases of our more general ones.

the benchmark suite DOSSIER (``Diagnostic Overview of Selection Schemes In
Evolutionary Runs'') for empirically analyzing selection schemes on important
aspects of exploitation and exploration. Exploitation is fundamentally hill
climbing, but we consider two scenarios: pure exploitation where each position
in the representation can be optimized independently, and constrained
exploitation where upward progress is more limited due to interactions between
positions. Exploration is necessary when the optimization path is less clear;
we consider the ability to follow multiple independent hill climbing pathways
and the ability to cross fitness valleys. Each combination of these scenarios
produces distinct fitness landscapes that help characterize the evolutionary
dynamics associated with a given selection scheme. We analyze six popular
selection schemes. Tournament selection and truncation selection both excelled
at with exploitation metrics, but performed poorly when exploration was
required; conversely, novelty search excelled at exploration but failed to
exploit gradients. Fitness sharing performed well when overcoming deception,
but poorly across all other diagnostics. Nondominated sorting was best for
maintaining diverse populations comprised of individuals inhabiting multiple
optima, but struggled to effectively exploit gradients. Lexicase selection
balanced search space exploration without sacrificing exploitation, generally
performing well across diagnostics. Our work demonstrates the value of
diagnostics for quickly building an intuitive understanding of selection scheme
characteristics, which can then be used to improve or develop new selection

learning methods to electronic health record (EHR) data for various clinical
purposes. This growing area of research has exposed the challenges of the
accessibility of EHRs. MIMIC is a popular, public, and free EHR dataset in a
raw format that has been used in numerous studies. The absence of standardized
pre-processing steps can be, however, a significant barrier to the wider
adoption of this rare resource. Additionally, this absence can reduce the
reproducibility of the developed tools and limit the ability to compare the
results among similar studies. In this work, we provide a greatly customizable
pipeline to extract, clean, and pre-process the data available in the fourth
version of the MIMIC dataset (MIMIC-IV). The pipeline also presents an
end-to-end wizard-like package supporting predictive model creations and
evaluations. The pipeline covers a range of clinical prediction tasks which can
be broadly classified into four categories - readmission, length of stay,
mortality, and phenotype prediction. The tool is publicly available at

overrecommending homogeneous items based on user features and historical
interactions. Filter bubbles will grow along the feedback loop and
inadvertently narrow user interests. Existing work usually mitigates filter
bubbles by incorporating objectives apart from accuracy such as diversity and
fairness. However, they typically sacrifice accuracy, hurting model fidelity
and user experience. Worse still, users have to passively accept the
recommendation strategy and influence the system in an inefficient manner with
high latency, e.g., keeping providing feedback (e.g., like and dislike) until
the system recognizes the user intention.
  This work proposes a new recommender prototype called UserControllable
Recommender System (UCRS), which enables users to actively control the
mitigation of filter bubbles. Functionally, 1) UCRS can alert users if they are
deeply stuck in filter bubbles. 2) UCRS supports four kinds of control commands
for users to mitigate the bubbles at different granularities. 3) UCRS can
respond to the controls and adjust the recommendations on the fly. The key to
adjusting lies in blocking the effect of out-of-date user representations on
recommendations, which contains historical information inconsistent with the
control commands. As such, we develop a causality-enhanced User-Controllable
Inference (UCI) framework, which can quickly revise the recommendations based
on user controls in the inference stage and utilize counterfactual inference to
mitigate the effect of out-of-date user representations. Experiments on three
datasets validate that the UCI framework can effectively recommend more desired
items based on user controls, showing promising performance w.r.t. both
accuracy and diversity.

  Prediction","15 pages,4 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Medical event prediction (MEP) is a fundamental task in the medical domain,
which needs to predict medical events, including medications, diagnosis codes,
laboratory tests, procedures, outcomes, and so on, according to historical
medical records. The task is challenging as medical data is a type of complex
time series data with heterogeneous and temporal irregular characteristics.
Many machine learning methods that consider the two characteristics have been
proposed for medical event prediction. However, most of them consider the two
characteristics separately and ignore the correlations among different types of
medical events, especially relations between historical medical events and
target medical events. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based
on attention mechanism, called cross-event attention-based time-aware network
(CATNet), for medical event prediction. It is a time-aware, event-aware and
task-adaptive method with the following advantages: 1) modeling heterogeneous
information and temporal information in a unified way and considering temporal
irregular characteristics locally and globally respectively, 2) taking full
advantage of correlations among different types of events via cross-event
attention. Experiments on two public datasets (MIMIC-III and eICU) show CATNet
can be adaptive with different MEP tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods on various MEP tasks. The source code of CATNet will be released after

caches in connected vehicular networks. The goal of the use of caches in our

environment and user mobility, the concept of age-of-information (AoI) is
considered for (1) updating the cached information as well as (2) maintaining
the freshness of cached information. The frequent updates of cached information
maintain the freshness of the information at the expense of network resources.
Here, the frequent updates increase the number of data transmissions between

tradeoff exists between the AoI of cached information and the system costs.

system cost reduction which is fundamentally required for content delivery

interest in deep learning-driven clinical decision support systems to tackle
this challenge. A major challenge to building deep neural networks for COVID-19
screening using POCUS is the heterogeneity in the types of probes used to
capture ultrasound images (e.g., convex vs. linear probes), which can lead to
very different visual appearances. In this study, we explore the impact of
leveraging extended linear-convex ultrasound augmentation learning on producing
enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 assessment, where we conduct data
augmentation on convex probe data alongside linear probe data that have been

diverse processing components, as it becomes the prevailing method to integrate

emerges: heterogeneous model to heterogeneous system mapping (H2H). While
previous mapping algorithms mostly focus on efficient computations, in this
work, we argue that it is indispensable to consider computation and
communication simultaneously for better system efficiency. We propose a novel
H2H mapping algorithm with both computation and communication awareness; by
slightly trading computation for communication, the system overall latency and
energy consumption can be largely reduced. The superior performance of our work

is then extended to tackle the event-triggered and periodic sampling
stabilization for a system where only partial state is available for feedback
and the system is subject to parameter uncertainties. The proposed framework is
further extended to solve two classes of event-triggered adaptive control
problems where the emulated closed-loop system does not admit an input-to-state

parameterized uncertainties, even-triggered global adaptive stabilization is
achieved without the global Lipschitz condition on nonlinearities as often

the reconstruction of 3D non-Cartesian MRI acquisitions due to extreme GPU
memory demand (>250 GB using traditional backpropagation) primarily because the
entire volume is needed for data-consistency steps embedded in the model. The
goal of this work is to develop and apply a memory efficient method called
block-wise learning that combines gradient checkpointing with patch-wise
training to allow for fast and high-quality 3D non-Cartesian reconstructions
using MBDL. Approach: Block-wise learning applied to a single unroll decomposes
the input volume into smaller patches, gradient checkpoints each patch, passes
each patch iteratively through a neural network regularizer, and then rebuilds
the full volume from these output patches for data-consistency. This method is
applied across unrolls during training. Block-wise learning significantly
reduces memory requirements by tying GPU memory to user selected patch size
instead of the full volume. This algorithm was used to train a MBDL
architecture to reconstruct highly undersampled, 1.25mm isotropic, pulmonary
magnetic resonance angiography volumes with matrix sizes varying from 300-450 x
200-300 x 300-450 on a single GPU. We compared block-wise learning
reconstructions against L1 wavelet compressed reconstructions and proxy ground
truth images. Main results: MBDL with block-wise learning significantly
improved image quality relative to L1 wavelet compressed sensing while
simultaneously reducing average reconstruction time 38x. Significance:
Block-wise learning allows for MBDL to be applied to high spatial resolution,
3D non-Cartesian datasets with improved image quality and significant
reductions in reconstruction time relative to traditional iterative methods

Here, we use the Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$(130) high-index crystal face as the
orthorhombic ferroelectric layer and construct a robust atomic structure of the
orthorhombic-Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$/SiO$_2$/Si gate stack without any gap

The calculated band offsets show that this gate structure is of the type-I band
alignment. Furthermore, the formation energies and charge transition levels
(CTLs) of defects reveal that the oxygen vacancy defects are more favorable to
form compared with other defects such as oxygen interstitial and Hf/Zr vacancy,
and their CTLs are mainly localized near the Si conduction band minimum and
valence band maximum, in agreement with the reported experimental results. The
oxygen vacancy defects are responsible for charge trapping/de-trapping behavior
in Si FeFET. This work provides an insight into gate defects and paves the way

wurtzite structure. We analyzed the character of the bond lengths and angles at
the atomic scale, using a supercell approach that does not impose any
constraint on the crystal potential. We show that the bond lengths of pristine
ZnS and ZnSe compounds are almost preserved between nearest neighbors, which is
different from what would be anticipated if Vegard's law were valid at the
atomic level. We also show that bond lengths start behaving in accordance to
Vegard's law from the third shell of nearest neighbors onward, which in turn
determines the average lattice parameters of the alloys determined by
diffraction experiments. Fundamental building blocks around the anions are
identified and are shown to be non-rigid but still volume preserving. Finally,
the geometrical analysis is connected to the trend exhibited by the electronic
structure, and in particular by the band gap. The latter is found to exhibit a
small deviation from the linearity with respect to the Se concentration, in
accordance to available experimental data. By assuming a quadratic dependence,
we can extract a bowing parameter and analyze various contributions to it with
various calculations under selected constraints. The structural deformation in
response to the doping process is shown to be the driving force behind the
deviation from linearity. The difference in stiffness between ZnS and ZnSe is
showed to play a key role in the asymmetric behavior of the bowing parameter
observed in the S-rich and Se-rich regions.

pretext tasks: image-text contrastive learning (ITC), masked language modeling
(MLM) and word-in-image prediction (WIP). The pre-trained model is able to
produce more informative representations with richer semantics, which could
readily benefit existing scene text detectors (such as EAST and PSENet) in the
down-stream text detection task. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can significantly improve the
performance of various representative text detectors, outperforming previous
pre-training approaches. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly

interface models before NO annealing include the gap states arising from the CO
bonds near the valence band edge of the bandgap. Our results imply that NO

most of the plume emission. Here we present high-resolution observations from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) and the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) that revealed numerous,
quasiperiodic, tiny jets (so-called jetlets) associated with transient
brightening, flows, and plasma heating at the chromospheric footpoints of the
plumelets. By analogy to larger coronal jets, these jetlets are most likely
produced within the plume base by magnetic reconnection between closed and open
flux at stressed 3D null points. The jetlet-associated brightenings are in
phase with plumelet-associated PDs, and vary with a period of about 3 to 5
minutes, which is remarkably consistent with the photospheric/chromospheric
p-mode oscillation. This reconnection at the open-closed boundary in the
chromosphere/transition region is likely modulated or driven by local
manifestations of the global p-mode waves. The jetlets extend upward to become
plumelets, contribute mass to the solar wind, and may be sources of the

(ii) an impermeable-wall with full layer of roughness elements matching the top
layer of the sediment bed, (iii) an impermeable-wall with half layer of
roughness elements , and (iv) a smooth wall. A double-averaging methodology is
used to compute the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses, form-induced stresses,
and turbulent kinetic energy budget. It is observed that the mean velocity,
Reynolds stresses, and form-induced pressure-velocity correlations representing
upwelling and downwelling fluxes are similar in magnitude for the permeable-bed
and impermeable-full layer wall cases. However, for the impermeable-half layer
case, the wall blocking effect results in higher streamwise and lower
wall-normal stresses compared to the permeable-bed case. Bed roughness
increases Reynolds shear stress whereas permeability has minimal influence. Bed
permeability, in contrast to Reynolds stresses, significantly influences
form-induced shear stress. Bed shear stress statistics show that probability of
extreme events increases in permeable bed and rough wall cases as compared to
the smooth wall. Findings suggest that bed permeability can have significant
impact on modeling of hyporheic exchange and its effect on bed shear and
pressure fluctuations are better captured by considering at least the top layer

only estimate the depth of extracted features, generating a sparse depth map.
To solve this sparsity problem, depth completion tasks that estimate a dense
depth from a sparse depth have gained significant importance in robotic
applications like exploration. Existing methodologies that use sparse depth
from visual SLAM mainly employ point features. However, point features have
limitations in preserving structural regularities owing to texture-less
environments and sparsity problems. To deal with these issues, we perform depth
completion with visual SLAM using line features, which can better contain
structural regularities than point features. The proposed methodology creates a
convex hull region by performing constrained Delaunay triangulation with depth
interpolation using line features. However, the generated depth includes
low-frequency information and is discontinuous at the convex hull boundary.
Therefore, we propose a mesh depth refinement (MDR) module to address this
problem. The MDR module effectively transfers the high-frequency details of an
input image to the interpolated depth and plays a vital role in bridging the
conventional and deep learning-based approaches. The Struct-MDC outperforms
other state-of-the-art algorithms on public and our custom datasets, and even
outperforms supervised methodologies for some metrics. In addition, the
effectiveness of the proposed MDR module is verified by a rigorous ablation

public-key encryption (PKE) schemes. To address this impending issue, the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently undertaking
the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project intending to
evaluate and subsequently standardize the suitable PQC scheme(s). One such
attractive approach, called Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE), has made to
the final round of the competition. Despite having some attractive features,
the IND-CCA security of the BIKE depends on the average decoder failure rate
(DFR), a higher value of which can facilitate a particular type of side-channel
attack. Although the BIKE adopts a Black-Grey-Flip (BGF) decoder that offers a
negligible DFR, the effect of weak-keys on the average DFR has not been fully
investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we first perform an implementation of
the BIKE scheme, and then through extensive experiments show that the weak-keys
can be a potential threat to IND-CCA security of the BIKE scheme and thus need
attention from the research community prior to standardization. We also propose
a key-check algorithm that can potentially supplement the BIKE mechanism and
prevent users from generating and adopting weak keys to address this issue.

for video capture often result in rolling shutter effects when relative
movements occur during the video acquisition process, calling for RS effect
removal techniques. However, current state-of-the-art RS correction methods
often fail to remove RS effects in real scenarios since the motions are various
and hard to model. To address this issue, we propose a real-world RS correction
dataset BS-RSC. Real distorted videos with corresponding ground truth are
recorded simultaneously via a well-designed beam-splitter-based acquisition
system. BS-RSC contains various motions of both camera and objects in dynamic
scenes. Further, an RS correction model with adaptive warping is proposed. Our
model can warp the learned RS features into global shutter counterparts
adaptively with predicted multiple displacement fields. These warped features
are aggregated and then reconstructed into high-quality global shutter frames
in a coarse-to-fine strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, and our dataset can improve the model's
ability to remove the RS effects in the real world.

Moreover, this often results in a static set of maskers that are inflexible to

inflexibility of traditional soundscape augmentation is twofold. First, given a

changes in the acoustic environment with near real-time latency. In this work,
we harness the combined prowess of cloud computing and the Internet of Things
(IoT) to allow in-situ listening and playback using microcontrollers while
delegating computationally expensive inference tasks to the cloud. In
particular, a serverless cloud architecture was used for inference, ensuring
near real-time latency and scalability without the need to provision computing

similarities, while MSR modules aim to fuse features at corresponding
positions. These two modules contain a few learnable parameters without
convolutions, based on which a lightweight yet effective model is built. This
architecture achieves state-of-the-art performances in real-time (51.3 FPS) and
becomes much faster with a reasonable performance drop on a smaller backbone

with inverter-based resources (IBR) integration into microgrids, the IBR
control provides a fast frequency response (FFR) to restore the system
frequency. Hence, supplementing PFR with FFR requires a sophisticated control
system and a high fidelity diesel electric generator model to design these
control systems. In this work, a high-fidelity model of a diesel electric
generator is developed. Its parameters are tuned using a surrogate optimization
algorithm by emulating its response during a load change to a 400 kVA
Caterpillar C-15 diesel generator, similar to those found in remote microgrids.
The diesel electric generator model consists of a synchronous machine, DC4B
excitation with V/Hz limiter, and a proposed modified IEEE GGOV1

simple, Woodward DEGOV, and a standard IEEE GGOV1 engine-governor model.
Results show that error in the diesel electric generator's response to load

in generating high-fidelity samples in generative modeling tasks. A major
limitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally
requires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned
diffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast
sampling method for DMs with a much less number of steps while retaining high
sample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure
in DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the
method of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned
diffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler~(DEIS).
It is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary

learned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed
method can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as

is a challenging problem that needs to be addressed by imaging algorithms to
take advantage of secondary particle detectors. In this work, we investigate
the utility of deep learning methods for achieving direct mapping from detector
data to the intrinsic dose distribution.
  $Approach$. We performed Monte Carlo simulations using GATE/Geant4 10.4
simulation toolkits to generate a dataset using human CT phantom irradiated
with high-energy protons and imaged with compact in-beam PET for realistic beam
delivery in a single-fraction ($\sim$2Gy). We developed a neural network model
based on conditional generative adversarial networks to generate dose maps
conditioned on coincidence distributions in the detector. The model performance
is evaluated by the mean relative error, absolute dose fraction difference, and
shift in Bragg peak position.
  $Main$ $results$. The relative deviation in the dose and range of the
distributions predicted by the model from the true values for mono-energetic
irradiation between 50 MeV and 122 MeV lie within 1% and 2%, respectively. This
was achieved using $\mathrm{10^5}$ coincidences acquired five minutes after
irradiation. The relative deviation in the dose and range for spread-out Bragg
peak distributions were within 1% and 2.6% uncertainties, respectively.
$Significance$. An important aspect of this study is the demonstration of a
method for direct mapping from detector counts to dose domain using the low
count data of compact detectors suited for practical implementation in particle
therapy. Including additional prior information in the future can further
expand the scope of our model and also extend its application to other areas of
medical imaging.

fracture toughness $K_{{\rm I}c}$, which represents the resistance to fracture,
can be estimated using the three-dimensional (3D) information of a fracture
surface, i.e., its roughness. However, this is time-consuming and expensive to
obtain the 3D information of a fracture surface; thus, it is desirable to
estimate $K_{{\rm I}c}$ from a two-dimensional (2D) image, which can be easily
obtained. In recent years, methods of estimating a 3D structure from its 2D
image using deep learning have been rapidly developed. In this study, we
propose a framework for fractography that directly estimates $K_{{\rm I}c}$
from a 2D fracture surface image using deep neural networks (DNNs). Typically,
image recognition using a DNN requires a tremendous amount of image data, which
is difficult to acquire for fractography owing to the high experimental cost.
To compensate for the limited data, in this study, we used the transfer
learning (TL) method, and constructed high-performance prediction models even
with a small dataset by transferring machine learning models trained using
other large datasets. We found that the regression model obtained using our
proposed framework can predict $K_{{\rm I}c}$ in the range of approximately 1-5
[MPa$\sqrt{m}$] with a standard deviation of the estimation error of
approximately $\pm$0.37 [MPa$\sqrt{m}$]. The present results demonstrate that
the DNN trained with TL opens a new route for quantitative fractography by
which parameters of fracture process can be estimated from a fracture surface
even with a small dataset. The proposed framework also enables the building of
regression models in a few hours. Therefore, our framework enables us to screen
a large number of image datasets available in the field of materials science
and find candidates that are worth expensive machine learning analysis.

secure key services. Of course, some recent efforts have been made to develop
secure communication protocols based on QKD. However, due to the limited key
generation capability of QKD devices, high quantum secure key utilization is
the major concern for QKD networks. Since traditional routing techniques do not
account for the state of quantum secure keys on links, applying them in QKD

Therefore, an efficient routing protocol for QKD networks, especially for

proposed for QKD networks. QOLSR considerably improves quantum key utilization

model three types of clouds with different density structures: collapsing
spherical, collapsing ellipsoidal, and static spherical profiles. The
collapsing models are better than the static models in matching the
observational characteristics in typical molecular clouds. This is mainly
because the gravity can speed up the formation of some important molecules
(e.g., H$_2$, CO, OH) by increasing the number density during collapse. The
different morphologies of prolate, oblate, and spherical clouds lead to
differences in chemical evolution, which are mainly due to their different
evolution of number density. We also study the effect of initial chemical
compositions on chemical evolution, and find that H atoms can accelerate OH
formation by two major reactions: O + H $\rightarrow$ OH in gas phase and on
dust grain surfaces, leading to the models in which hydrogen is mainly atomic
initially better match observations than the models in which hydrogen is mainly
molecular initially. Namely, to match observations, initially hydrogen must be
mostly atomic. The CO molecules are able to form even without the pre-existence
of H$_2$. We also study the influence of gas temperature, dust temperature,
intensity of interstellar radiation field and cosmic-ray ionization rate on
chemical evolution in static clouds. The static CO clouds with high dust
temperature, strong radiation field, and intensive cosmic rays are transient
due to rapid CO destruction.

deformable curved surfaces are constructed in the large deformation limit.
Emphasis is placed on the formulation of objective rates that account for
normal deformations whilst ensuring that tangential flows are Eulerian, and the
use of the surface derivative (rather than the covariant derivative) in the
nematic free energy, which elastically couples local order to out-of-plane
bending of the surface. Focusing on surface geometry and its dynamical
interplay with the hydrodynamics, several illustrative instabilities are then
characterised. These include cases where the role of the Scriven-Love number
and its nematic analogue are non-negligible, and where the active nematic
forcing can be characterised by an analogue of the F\""{o}ppl-von-K\'{a}rm\'{a}n
number. For the former, flows and changes to the nematic texture are coupled to
surface geometry by viscous dissipation. This is shown to result in non-trivial
relaxation dynamics for a nematic tube. For the latter, the nematic active
forcing couples to the surface bending terms of the nematic free energy,
resulting in extensile (active ruffling) and contractile (active pearling)
instabilities in the tube shape, as well as active bend instabilities in the
nematic texture. In comparison to the flat case, such bend instabilities now
have a threshold set by the extrinsic curvature of the tube. Finally, we
examine a topological defect located on an almost flat surface and show that
there exists a steady state where a combination of defect elasticity, activity

the FM induces the dynamic magnetization and superconducting current in the
underlying PM and SC, respectively, which affect the SW propagation by their
magnetic fields. As a result of this interaction, the SW spectrum becomes
nonreciprocal to depend on the sign of the SW wave vector q. We show that the
nonreciprocal contribution to the SW spectra in FM/PM and FM/SC systems is
given by the frequency shift of
{\Delta}{\omega}(q)={\omega}(q)-{\omega}(-q)=a(T)({\tau}{\cdot}q) with
{\tau}=(n{\times}M) being the toroidal magnetic moment, M the FM magnetization,
n the unit vector normal to the FM/PM(SC) interface, and a(T) the

T close to the critical temperature Tc for the FM-PM or normal metal-SC

However, while the former method only applies to proximal algorithms, it has

good spatial correspondence with regions of intense photospheric magnetic
field. Their observation started more than a hundred years ago with the
invention of the spectroheliograph. While the historical spectroheliograms are
essential for studying the long-term variability of the Sun, the modern
satellite-borne observations can help us reveal the nature of chromospheric
brightenings in previously unattainable detail. Our aim is to improve the
understanding of the relation between magnetic fields and radiative structures
by studying modern seeing-free observations of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation
around 1600 \r{A} and photospheric magnetic fields. We used Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations of photospheric magnetic fields and
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations of FUV contrast around 1600
\r{A}. We developed a robust method to find contrast thresholds defining bright
and dark AIA 1600 \r{A} pixels, and we combine them to bright and dark
clusters. We investigate the relation of magnetic fields and AIA 1600 \r{A}
radiation in bright and dark clusters. We find that the percentage of bright
pixels entirely explains the observed variability of 1600 \r{A} emission. We
developed a multilinear regression model based on the percentages of bright and
dark pixels, which can reliably predict the magnitude of the disk-averaged
unsigned magnetic field. We find that bright and dark clusters closely
correspond respectively to the populations of moderate (B > 55 G) and strong (B
> 1365 G) magnetic field HMI clusters. The largest bright clusters have a
constant mean unsigned magnetic field, as found previously for Ca II K plages.
However, the magnetic field strength of bright clusters is 254.7$\pm$0.1 G,
which is roughly 100 G larger than found earlier for Ca II K plages.

non-Hermitian degeneracies known as exceptional points~(EPs). The extensively
studied defective EPs occur when the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable.
Aside from this degeneracy, we show that NH systems may host two further types
of degeneracies, namely, non-defective EPs and ordinary (Hermitian) nodal
points. The non-defective EPs manifest themselves by i) the diagonalizability
of the NH Hamiltonian at these points, ii) the non-diagonalizability of the
Hamiltonian along certain intersections of these points and iii) instabilities
in the Jordan decomposition when approaching the points from certain
directions. We demonstrate that certain discrete symmetries, namely
parity-time, parity-particle-hole, and pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, guarantee the
occurrence of both defective and non-defective EPs. We extend this list of
symmetries by including the NH time-reversal symmetry in two-band systems.
Two-band and four-band models exemplify our findings. Through an example, we
further reveal that ordinary nodal points may coexist with defective EPs in NH
models when the above symmetries are relaxed.

results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the quality of
the decompressed point clouds, achieving 9.30dB BDPSNR gain on three

outstanding material system for the semiconductor industry in the 1950s. In
state-of-the-art device technology, SiO$_2$ is widely used as an insulator in
combination with high-$k$ dielectrics such as HfO$_2$, demanding fabrication of
ultra-thin interfacial layers. The classical standard model derived by Deal and
Grove accurately describes the oxidation of Si in a progressed stage, however,
strongly underestimates growth rates for thin oxide layers. Recent studies
report a variety of oxidation mechanisms during the growth of oxide films in
the range of \SI{10}{\angstrom} with various details still under debate. This
paper presents a first-principles based approach to theoretically assess the
thermal oxidation process of the technologically relevant Si(100) surfaceduring
this initial stage. Our investigations range from the chemisorption of single
O$_2$ molecules onto the $p(2\times2)$ reconstructed Si surface to oxidized Si
surface layers with a thickness of up to \SI{20}{\angstrom}. The initially
observed enhanced growth rate is assigned to barrierless O$_2$ chemisorption
events upon which the oxygen molecule dissociate. We present strong evidence
for an immediate amorphization of the oxide layer from the onset of oxidation.
Surface reactions dominate until the surface is saturated with oxygen and
separated from the Si substrate by a \SI{5}{\angstrom} transition region. The
saturated surface becomes inert to dissociative reactions and enables the
diffusion of molecular oxygen to the \interface interface as assumed within the
Deal-Grove model. Further oxidation of the Si substrate is then provided by
O$_2$ dissociations at the interface due to the same charge transfer process
responsible for the chemisorption at the surface.

To achieve this, a vibrotactile device called ErgoTac is employed to develop
three different feedback modalities that are able to provide a directional
guidance at the body segments towards a desired pose. In addition, an
evaluation is made to find the most suitable, comfortable, and intuitive
feedback modality for the user. Therefore, these modalities are first compared
experimentally on fifteen subjects wearing eight ErgoTac devices to achieve
targeted arm and torso configurations. The most effective directional feedback
modality is then evaluated on five subjects in a set of experiments in which an
ergonomic optimisation module provides the optimised body posture while
performing heavy lifting or forceful exertion tasks. The results yield strong
evidence on the usefulness and the intuitiveness of one of the developed
modalities in providing guidance towards ergonomic working conditions, by
minimising the effect of an external load on body joints. We believe that the
integration of such low-cost devices in workplaces can help address the
well-known and complex problem of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.

fine-grained entity typing. By randomly masking and recovering entities'

Utilizing the fine grained typing, we can filter unrelated entities during

Experiments on link prediction benchmarks demonstrate the proposed key

adapting a foreground to make it compatible with a background. However,
existing methods always only use the real image as the positive sample to guide
the training, and at most introduce the corresponding composite image as a
single negative sample for an auxiliary constraint, which leads to limited
distortion knowledge, and further causes a too large solution space, making the
generated harmonized image distorted. Besides, none of them jointly constrain
from the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency,
which exacerbates this problem. Moreover, recent region-aware adaptive instance
normalization achieves great success but only considers the global background
feature distribution, making the aligned foreground feature distribution
biased. To address these issues, we propose a self-consistent style contrastive
learning scheme (SCS-Co). By dynamically generating multiple negative samples,
our SCS-Co can learn more distortion knowledge and well regularize the
generated harmonized image in the style representation space from two aspects
of the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency,
leading to a more photorealistic visual result. In addition, we propose a
background-attentional adaptive instance normalization (BAIN) to achieve an
attention-weighted background feature distribution according to the

superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods in both

II supernova, (SN) 2019va, which shows an unusually flat plateau-phase

shows a weak brightening towards the end of the plateau phase. These uncommon
features are related to the influence of 56Ni decay on the light curve during
the plateau phase, when the SN emission is usually dominated by cooling of the
envelope. The inferred 56Ni mass of SN 2019va is 0.088+/-0.018 solar mass,
which is significantly larger than most SNe II. To estimate the influence of
56Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we calculate the ratio (dubbed as
eta_Ni) between the integrated time-weighted energy from 56Ni decay and that
from envelope cooling within the plateau phase, obtaining a value of 0.8 for SN
2019va, which is the second largest value among SNe II that have been measured.
After removing the influence of 56Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we
found that the progenitor/explosion parameters derived for SN 2019va are more
reasonable. In addition, SN 2019va is found to have weaker metal lines in its
spectra compared to other SNe IIP at similar epochs, implying a low-metallicity
progenitor, which is consistent with the metal-poor environment inferred from
the host-galaxy spectrum. We further discuss the possible reasons that might

function and activation functions of a GNN play a key role on its size
generalization ability. We take the GNN with mean aggregator, called mean-GNN,

several GNNs in the literature of wireless communications can generalize well
to problem scales. To illustrate how to design GNNs with size generalizability

suggest to select or pre-train activation function in the output layer of

trials as a single average treatment effect for a certain patient population.
Estimates of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) are more useful
for individualized treatment decision making, but randomized trials are often
too small to estimate the CATE. There are several examples in medical
literature where the assumption of a known constant relative treatment effect
(e.g. an odds-ratio) is used to estimate CATE models from large observational
datasets. One approach to estimating these CATE models is by using the relative
treatment effect as an offset, while estimating the covariate-specific baseline
risk. Whether this is a valid approach in the presence of unobserved
confounding is unknown. We demonstrate for a simple example that offset models
do not recover the true CATE in the presence of unobserved confounding. We then
explore the magnitude of this bias in numerical experiments. For virtually all
plausible confounding magnitudes, estimating the CATE using offset models is
more accurate than assuming a single absolute treatment effect whenever there
is sufficient variation in the baseline risk. Next, we observe that the
odds-ratios reported in randomized controlled trials are not the odds-ratios
that are needed in offset models because trials often report the marginal
odds-ratio. We introduce a constraint to better use marginal odds-ratios from
randomized controlled trials and find that the newly introduced constrained
offset models have lower bias than standard offset models. Finally, we
highlight directions for future research for exploiting the assumption of a

modification of that theory which allows for the limit to be performed in any
topology. For this, a second reference non-dynamical connection is introduced
in addition to the physical spacetime connection. The choice of reference
connection is related to the covering space of the spacetime topology. Instead
of featuring only the physical spacetime Ricci tensor, the modified Einstein
equation features the difference between the physical and the reference Ricci
tensors. This theory should be considered instead of general relativity if one
wants to study a model universe with a non-Euclidean topology and admitting a
non-relativistic limit.

enhancement tasks, which models a non-linear 3D color transform by sparsely
sampling it into a discretized 3D lattice. Previous works have made efforts to
learn image-adaptive output color values of LUTs for flexible enhancement but
neglect the importance of sampling strategy. They adopt a sub-optimal uniform
sampling point allocation, limiting the expressiveness of the learned LUTs
since the (tri-)linear interpolation between uniform sampling points in the LUT
transform might fail to model local non-linearities of the color transform.
Focusing on this problem, we present AdaInt (Adaptive Intervals Learning), a
novel mechanism to achieve a more flexible sampling point allocation by
adaptively learning the non-uniform sampling intervals in the 3D color space.
In this way, a 3D LUT can increase its capability by conducting dense sampling
in color ranges requiring highly non-linear transforms and sparse sampling for
near-linear transforms. The proposed AdaInt could be implemented as a compact
and efficient plug-and-play module for a 3D LUT-based method. To enable the
end-to-end learning of AdaInt, we design a novel differentiable operator called
AiLUT-Transform (Adaptive Interval LUT Transform) to locate input colors in the
non-uniform 3D LUT and provide gradients to the sampling intervals. Experiments
demonstrate that methods equipped with AdaInt can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on two public benchmark datasets with a negligible overhead
increase. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ImCharlesY/AdaInt.

investigate the effect of precipitate morphology and size distribution on

for elastic and plastic work dissipation in the fracture process zone is used
to formulate the coupled constitutive behavior for brittle and ductile damage,
respectively. Representative Volume Elements (RVE) with varying particle
morphology and orientation were generated and their uni-axial loading was
simulated to assess the damage resistance of the different model
microstructures. For critical energy release rate $G_c$ values of the aluminum
matrix ranging from 4 to 8~Jm$^{-2}$ for single crystals and from 10 to
16~Jm$^{-2}$ for polycrystals, the model predicts a change in failure modes
from particle debonding to cracking followed by ductile matrix failure. The
change of particle failure mechanism as a result of increased $G_c$ is observed
for both, single and polycrystalline model microstructures. For the case of
particle debonding, microstructures with circular or ellipsoidal particles
(with the major axis perpendicular to the loading direction) show a higher

Thus, gravastars consist of stiff matter shells with an interior deSitter space
and an exterior Schwarzshild spacetime whose attractive gravity balances the
interior repulsive gravity of the interior deSitter spacetime leading to a
stable stiff matter shell. Similar stabilization effects may be achieved by
considering rotating shells. Here we study the stability of slowly rotating
fluid shells. We show that the angular velocity of the shell has stabilizing
properties analogous to the repulsive deSitter gravity of the interior of a
gravastar. We thus use the Israel junction conditions and the fluid equation of
state of the rotating shell to construct the dynamical equations that determine
the evolution of the rotating shell radius. These dynamical equations depend on
the parameters of the background spacetime and on the angular velocity of the
shell. Assuming a rotating interior and a Schwarzschild exterior spacetime we
show that the angular velocity of the shell has interesting stabilizing
properties on the evolution of its radius R. Thus rotating matter (or vacuum)
shells can imitate black holes while avoiding the presence of a singularity and
without the presence of an interior deSitter space.

current increases with time before reaching a steady-state value within a
response time (from 10.000 s down to 10 s) that strongly depends on the applied
bias. Our findings corroborate the existence of a coupling between electronic
transport and ion kinetics that ultimately establishes the time scale of
electronic current. Effective ion mobility mui is extracted that exhibits
applied electrical field E dependence that varies on the perovskite
composition. While ion mobility results field-independent in the case of

ion mobility in the range of mui = 10-7-10-6 cm-2 V-1 s-1, in accordance with

two magnon modes are, respectively, coupled to the microwave cavity by the
magnetic dipole interaction. We first generate a stationary nonlocal entangled

exploiting the magnomechanical parametric down-conversion and the cavity-magnon

simultaneously, turn on a red-detuned pulsed drive on the ferrimagnet-2. The
latter drive is used to activate the magnomechanical beamsplitter interaction,

temperature based on chiral effective field theory interactions to
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. Our results assess the theoretical
uncertainties from the many-body calculation and the chiral expansion. Using a
Gaussian process emulator for the free energy, we derive the thermodynamic
properties of matter through consistent derivatives and use the Gaussian
process to access arbitrary proton fraction and temperature. This enables a
first nonparametric calculation of the equation of state in beta equilibrium,
and of the speed of sound and the symmetry energy at finite temperature.
Moreover, our results show that the thermal part of the pressure decreases with
increasing densities.

classification, less than 1% of adversary clients suffices to manipulate the
model output without any drop in the performance on clean sentences. For a less

vanishing components of the off-components of the field equation, in contrast

Using the KB spacetime form, we derive the analytic form of the energy-density,
radial, and tangential pressures and the anisotropic form. All of these
quantities are affected by the dimensional parameter $\epsilon$, which causes
them to have a noted difference from those given in the frame of Einstein
general relativity. The derived model of this study exhibits a non-trivial form
of torsion scalar, and it also contains three constants that we drew from the
matching of the boundary condition with a line element that also features a
non-trivial form of torsion scalar. Having established the physical conditions
that are needed for any real stellar, we check our model and show in detail
that it bypasses all of these. Finally, we analyze the model's stability
utilizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and adiabatic index and show
that our model satisfies these.

Machine Learning (ML) in a distributed manner without directly accessing

difficulty to obtain high accuracy, high communication cost between clients and
the server, and security attacks related to adversarial ML. To tackle these
three challenges, we propose an FL algorithm inspired by evolutionary
techniques. The proposed algorithm groups clients randomly in many clusters,
each with a model selected randomly to explore the performance of different
models. The clusters are then trained in a repetitive process where the worst
performing cluster is removed in each iteration until one cluster remains. In
each iteration, some clients are expelled from clusters either due to using
poisoned data or low performance. The surviving clients are exploited in the
next iteration. The remaining cluster with surviving clients is then used for
training the best FL model (i.e., remaining FL model). Communication cost is
reduced since fewer clients are used in the final training of the FL model. To
evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct a number of
experiments using FEMNIST dataset and compare the result against the random FL
algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of accuracy, communication cost,

the large-scale, LSASRD contains a list of challenging factors, such as complex

Secondly, we design a cross-role protocol to evaluate ASR performance, in which
query and gallery images must come from different roles to validate an ASR
model is to learn abstract painting style rather than learn discriminative

presence of a melting transition in the nerve membrane. In this transition, the
area of the nerve membrane and the nerve thickness change. It depends on
thermodynamic variables including temperature, the chemical potentials of
anesthetics and on hydrostatic pressure. A further variable relevant for
movement science is the the stretching of nerves, i.e., a tension in the nerve

problems can be tackled with, e.g., iterative regularisation methods and the
main challenge is to determine a suitable stopping index for the iteration.
Convergence results for popular adaptive methods to determine the stopping
index often come along with restrictions, e.g. concerning the type of
ill-posedness of the problem, the unknown solution or the error distribution.
In the recent work \cite{jahn2021optimal} a modification of the discrepancy
principle, one of the most widely used adaptive methods, applied to spectral
cut-off regularisation was presented which provides excellent convergence
properties in general settings. Here we investigate the performance of the
modified discrepancy principle with other filter based regularisation methods
and we hereby focus on the iterative Landweber method. We show that the method
yields optimal convergence rates and present some numerical experiments
confirming that it is also attractive in terms of computational complexity. The
key idea is to incorporate and modify the discretisation dimension in an
adaptive manner.

diagrams, a graphical notation for representing and manipulating a certain
class of linear maps on qubits, and Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a large
family of quantum error correcting codes constructed from classical codes,
including for example the Steane code, surface codes, and colour codes. The
stabilisers of a CSS code have an especially nice structure arising from a pair
of orthogonal $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspaces, or in the case of maximal CSS
codes, a single subspace and its orthocomplement. On the other hand, phase-free
ZX diagrams can always be efficiently reduced to a normal form given by the
basis elements of an $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspace. Here, we will show that
these two ways of describing a quantum state by an $\mathbb F_2$-linear
subspace $S$ are in fact the same. Namely, the maximal CSS code generated by
$S$ fixes the quantum state whose ZX normal form is also given by $S$.
  This insight gives us an immediate translation from stabilisers of a maximal
CSS code into a ZX diagram describing its associated state. We show that we can
extend this translation to stabilisers and logical operators of any (possibly
non-maximal) CSS code by ""bending wires"". To demonstrate the utility of this
translation, we give a simple picture of the surface code and a fully graphical
derivation of the action of physical lattice surgery operations on the space of
logical qubits, completing the ZX presentation of lattice surgery initiated by
de Beudrap and Horsman.

was to contribute to the awakening of a dialogue between information and
documentation concerned with knowledge organization systems (KOSs), and
branches in computer science with an emphasis on machines, algorithms and
ontologies. The technological evolution of the last decades has not only
fostered the emergence of ever more KOSs but also semantic web technologies.
Both the actions of 'making a KOS' and 'applying existing KOSs' represent
research. The design of an information layer for a knowledge domain and the
design of a domain specific research process are intrinsically interwoven. We
extended our intervention to KOS practices into education, by presenting a
translation of existing standards and recommendations about linked open data
(LOD) publishing for non-experts. The chapters describe the state of the art in
providing KOSs as semantic artefacts; how the state of the art is applied in
new fields; how the state of the art is pushed towards new technological
solutions by being confronted with new applications; how best practices need to
be tailored towards specific solutions; and what challenges occur when merging
new and old ways of expressing KOSs. The linked data (LD) ecosystem represents
a source of knowledge generation, acquisition, production and dissemination.
The underlying discourse shows historical vision alongside the promise of
linking knowledge for interaction. The already maturing ecosystems of the SW
are interlocking information institutions clearly devoted to the expansion of
human experience through the growth of knowledge interaction.

called robots, at a point (not known beforehand) placed on an infinite
triangular grid. The robots are considered to be myopic, i.e., robots have
limited visibility. Earlier works of gathering mostly considered the robots
either on a plane or on a circle or on a rectangular grid under both full and
limited visibility. In the triangular grid, there are two works to the best of
our knowledge. The first one is by Cicerone et al. on arbitrary pattern
formation where full visibility is considered. The other one by Shibata et al.
which considers seven robots with 2- hop visibility that form a hexagon with
one robot in the center of the hexagon in a collision-less environment under a
fully synchronous scheduler .
  In this work, we first show that gathering on a triangular grid with 1-hop
vision of robots is not possible even under a fully synchronous scheduler if
the robots do not agree on any axis. So one axis agreement has been considered
in this work (i.e., the robots agree on a direction and its orientation). We
have also shown that the lower bound for time is $\Omega(n)$ epochs when $n$
number of robots are gathering on an infinite triangular grid. An algorithm is
then presented where a swarm of $n$ number of robots with 1-hop visibility can
gather within $O(n)$ epochs under a semi-synchronous scheduler. So the
algorithm presented here is time optimal.

desirable goal is generating a spectrum that covers the whole visible range
(400 -900nm), i.e., white light. Nowadays, white-light generation is usually
achieved in specially designed photonic fibres requiring high laser
intensities. However, in previous studies we showed that amorphous powders of
$(PhSn)_4S_6$ cluster-molecules generate white light when they are irradiated
by low-intensity near-infrared light. In this study, we use the mid- and
far-infrared radiation of a free-electron laser to investigate the same
molecules. White-light generation is observed for excitation with wavelength
between 8 and 240$\mu$ m. While the emitted radiation shows only slight
variations, its intensity strongly depends on the excitation wavelength. We
then match the wavelength dependent efficiency with the infrared absorption
spectra of the material. This comparison shows: whenever the excitation can
introduce molecular vibrations, less white light is generated. For all other
wavelengths the excitation interacts mostly with the electron system. This
shows that the electron system and the molecular backbone are decoupled to a
large extent. Our work contributes to the understanding of the nonlinear
process that underlies white-light generation in $(PhSn)_4S_6$ cluster
molecules. Additionally, it shows the high potential of this material in
applications where a broad laser spectrum is desired.

Compatibility. It is in the form of probability distribution, has an obvious
modal gap with STISR - a pixel-level task; 2) Inaccuracy. it usually contains
wrong information, thus will mislead the main task and degrade super-resolution
performance. In this paper, we present a novel method C3-STISR that jointly
exploits the recognizer's feedback, visual and linguistical information as
clues to guide super-resolution. Here, visual clue is from the images of texts
predicted by the recognizer, which is informative and more compatible with the
STISR task; while linguistical clue is generated by a pre-trained
character-level language model, which is able to correct the predicted texts.
We design effective extraction and fusion mechanisms for the triple cross-modal
clues to generate a comprehensive and unified guidance for super-resolution.
Extensive experiments on TextZoom show that C3-STISR outperforms the SOTA

videos for quality regression, which are regarded as the sub-optimal solutions
because of the domain shifts between these tasks and the UGC VQA task. In this
paper, we propose a very simple but effective UGC VQA model, which tries to
address this problem by training an end-to-end spatial feature extraction
network to directly learn the quality-aware spatial feature representation from
raw pixels of the video frames. We also extract the motion features to measure
the temporal-related distortions that the spatial features cannot model. The
proposed model utilizes very sparse frames to extract spatial features and
dense frames (i.e. the video chunk) with a very low spatial resolution to
extract motion features, which thereby has low computational complexity. With
the better quality-aware features, we only use the simple multilayer perception
layer (MLP) network to regress them into the chunk-level quality scores, and
then the temporal average pooling strategy is adopted to obtain the video-level
quality score. We further introduce a multi-scale quality fusion strategy to
solve the problem of VQA across different spatial resolutions, where the
multi-scale weights are obtained from the contrast sensitivity function of the
human visual system. The experimental results show that the proposed model
achieves the best performance on five popular UGC VQA databases, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The code will be publicly

one-space-dimensional pressureless compressible Euler equations. The delta
shock appearing in the singular Riemann problem is exactly the piston that may
move freely forward or backward in a straight tube, driven by the pressureless
Euler flows on two sides of it in the tube. This result not only helps to
understand the physics of the somewhat mysterious delta shocks, but also
provides a way to reduce the fluid-solid interaction problem, which consists of
several initial-boundary value problems coupled with moving boundaries, to a
simpler Cauchy problem. We show the equivalence from three different
perspectives. The first one is from the sticky particles, and derives the
ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the trajectory of the piston by a
straightforward application of conservation law of momentum, which is
physically simple and clear. The second one is to study a coupled
initial-boundary value problem of pressureless Euler equations, with the piston
as a moving boundary following the Newton's second law. It depends on a concept
of Radon measure solutions of initial-boundary value problems of the

of fast convergence rates to the global optima of the original

fault diagnostics models due to the domain shift between the training and the

been proposed to overcome such domain shifts, their application is limited if
the fault classes represented in the two domains are not the same. To enable a
better transferability of the trained models between two different domains,
particularly in setups where only the healthy data class is shared between the
two domains, we propose a new framework for Partial and Open-Partial domain
adaptation based on generating distinct fault signatures with a Wasserstein
GAN. The main contribution of the proposed framework is the controlled
synthetic fault data generation with two main distinct characteristics.
Firstly, the proposed methodology enables to generate unobserved fault types in
the target domain by having only access to the healthy samples in the target
domain and faulty samples in the source domain. Secondly, the fault generation
can be controlled to precisely generate distinct fault types and fault severity
levels. The proposed method is especially suited in extreme domain adaption
settings that are particularly relevant in the context of complex and
safety-critical systems, where only one class is shared between the two
domains. We evaluate the proposed framework on Partial as well as Open-Partial
domain adaptation tasks on two bearing fault diagnostics case studies. Our
experiments conducted in different label space settings showcase the
versatility of the proposed framework. The proposed methodology provided
superior results compared to other methods given large domain gaps.

most Babcock-Leighton (BL)-type solar dynamo models, in which the poloidal
field is produced by the emergence and subsequent dispersal of sunspot groups.
However, magnetic activity of fully convective stars and MHD simulations of
global stellar convection have recently raised serious doubts regarding the
importance of the tachocline in the generation of the toroidal field. In this
study, we aim to develop a new BL-type dynamo model, in which the dynamo
operates mainly within the bulk of the convection zone. Our 2D model includes
the effect of solar-like differential rotation, one-cell meridional flow,
near-surface radial pumping, strong turbulent diffusion, BL-type poloidal
source, and nonlinear back-reaction of the magnetic field on its source with a
vertical outer boundary condition. The model leads to a simple dipolar
configuration of the poloidal field that has the dominant latitudinal
component, which is wound up by the latitudinal shear within the bulk of the
convection zone to generate the toroidal flux. As a result, the tachocline
plays a negligible role in the model. The model reproduces the basic properties
of the solar cycle, including (a) approximately 11 yr cycle period and 18 yr
extended cycle period; (b) equatorward propagation of the antisymmetric
toroidal field starting from high latitudes; and (c) polar field evolution that
is consistent with observations. Our model opens the possibility for a paradigm
shift in understanding the solar cycle to transition from the classical flux
transport dynamo.

Owing to the disentangled feature space, our method can smoothly control the

of an anomalous Josephson coupling and a dominance of high-harmonics in the

variations in the electronic structure across the heterostructure can generally
turn the ground state of the junction from 0- to a generic value of the
Josephson phase, thus realizing the so-called $\varphi$-junction. Hallmarks of
the resulting Josephson behavior, apart from non-standard current-phase

the clearest sign of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI). However, the
magnitude of this interaction is poorly constrained, and the intermittent
nature of the interaction is a challenge for observers. AU Mic is an early M
dwarf, and the most actively flaring planet host detected to date. Its
innermost companion, AU Mic b, is a promising target for magnetic SPI
observations. We used optical light curves of AU Mic obtained by the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite to search for signs of flaring SPI with AU Mic b
using a customized Anderson-Darling test. In the about $50$ days of
observations, the flare distributions with orbital, rotational, and synodic

strongest deviation ($p=0.07,\;n=71$) from intrinsic flaring with the orbital
period of AU Mic b, in the high energy half of our sample ($ED>1$ s). If it
reflects the true SPI signal from AU Mic b, extending the observing time by a

a $-3/4$ power-law with the magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ : $|\Pi_{\mathcal{H}}
| \le c \epsilon \ell_f Rm^{-3/4}\max[Pm,1]^{1/4}$, where $Pm$ the magnetic
Prandtl number and $\ell_f$ the forcing lengthscale. We demonstrate this
scaling with $Rm$ using direct numerical simulations of turbulent dynamos
forced at intermediate scales. The results further indicate that nonlinear
saturation is achieved by a balance between the inverse cascade and dissipation
at domain size scales $L$ for which the saturation value of the magnetic energy
is bounded by ${\mathcal{E}}_\text{m}\leq c L (\epsilon \ell_f)^{2/3}
Rm^{1/4}\max[1,Pm]^{1/4}$. Numerical simulations also demonstrate this bound.

dynamical invariants is provided. They are the correlation dimension
($\mathcal{D}$) and the correlation entropy ($\mathcal{K}$), both having
attracted attention over the past decades, and a new invariant called the
correlation concentration ($\mathcal{A}$) introduced in the present study. The
correlation concentration is defined as the normalised mean distance between
the reconstruction vectors, evaluated by the underlying probability measure on
the infinite-dimensional embedding space. These three invariants determine the
scaling behaviour of the system's R\'{e}nyi-type extended entropy, modelled by
Kummer's confluent hypergeometric function, with respect to the gauge parameter
($\rho$) coupled to the distance between the reconstruction vectors. The
entropy function reproduces the known scaling behaviours of $\mathcal{D}$ and
$\mathcal{K}$ in the 'microscopic' limit $\rho\to\infty$ while exhibiting a new
scaling behaviour of $\mathcal{A}$ in the other, 'macroscopic' limit $\rho\to
0$. The three invariants are estimated simultaneously via nonlinear regression
analysis without needing separate estimations for each invariant. The proposed
method is verified through simulations in both discrete and continuous systems.

appearance discrimination and size estimation by the classification and
regression. While such a paradigm typically optimizes the classification and
regression independently, leading to task misalignment (accurate prediction
boxes have no high target confidence scores). In this paper, to alleviate this
misalignment, we propose a novel tracking paradigm, called SiamLA. Within this
paradigm, a series of simple, yet effective localization-aware components are
introduced, to generate localization-aware target confidence scores.
Specifically, with the proposed localization-aware dynamic label (LADL) loss
and localization-aware label smoothing (LALS) strategy, collaborative
optimization between the classification and regression is achieved, enabling
classification scores to be aware of location state, not just appearance
similarity. Besides, we propose a separate localization branch, centered on a
localization-aware feature aggregation (LAFA) module, to produce location
quality scores to further modify the classification scores. Consequently, the
resulting target confidence scores, are more discriminative for the location
state, allowing accurate prediction boxes tend to be predicted as high scores.
Extensive experiments are conducted on six challenging benchmarks, including
GOT-10k, TrackingNet, LaSOT, TNL2K, OTB100 and VOT2018. Our SiamLA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
Furthermore, a stability analysis reveals that our tracking paradigm is
relatively stable, implying the paradigm is potential to real-world
applications.

To address these issues, we introduce PyramidCLIP, which constructs an input
pyramid with different semantic levels for each modality, and aligns visual
elements and linguistic elements in the form of hierarchy via peer-level
semantics alignment and cross-level relation alignment. Furthermore, we soften
the loss of negative samples (unpaired samples) so as to weaken the strict

the model to distinguish compatible negative pairs. Experiments on five
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PyramidCLIP. In

PyramidCLIP exceeds CLIP on ImageNet zero-shot classification top-1 accuracy by

protosolar value. Juno's measurements recently confirmed the supersolar N
abundance and also found that the O abundance was enriched by a factor 1--5
compared to its protosolar value. Here, we aim at determining the radial and
temporal evolution of the composition of gases and solids in the protosolar
nebula (hereafter, PSN) to assess the possibility that Jupiter's current
composition was acquired via the direct accretion of supersolar gases. To do
so, we model the evolution of a 1D $\alpha-$viscous accretion disk that
includes the radial transport of dust and ice particles and their vapors, with
their sublimation and condensation rates, to compute the composition of the
PSN. We find that the composition of Jupiter's envelope can be explained only
from its accretion from PSN gas ($\alpha \le 10^{-3}$), or from a mixture of
vapors and solids ($\alpha>10^{-3}$). The composition of the PSN at 4 AU,
namely between the locations of the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ icelines, reproduces the
one measured in Jupiter between 100 and 300 kyr of disk evolution. Our results
are found compatible with both the core accretion model, where Jupiter would
acquire its metallicity by late accretion of volatile-rich planetesimals, and
the gravitational collapse scenario, where the composition of proto-Jupiter
would be similar to that of the PSN.

AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated (VARFI) framework for Gaussian
processes. This novel approach allows to quantify the directed information flow
accounting for the simultaneous presence of short-term dynamics and long-range
correlations among the analyzed processes. The approach is first illustrated in
simulated VARFI processes and then applied to H, S and R time series measured
in healthy subjects monitored at rest and during mental and postural stress.
Our results highlight the dependence of the information transfer on the balance
between short-term and long-range correlations in coupled dynamical systems,
which cannot be observed using standard methods that do not consider long-range
correlations. The proposed methodology shows that postural stress induces
larger redundant effects at short time scales and mental stress induces larger
cardiovascular information transfer at longer time scales.

reconstruction methods with varying run time and computational complexity have
been proposed. Yet, no quantitative comparison between the different
reconstruction methods has been carried out so far. This paper focuses on a
comparison based on three sets of hot-rod phantom images captured with an
experimental Gamma-camera consisting of a Tungsten-based MURA mask with a 2mm
thick 256x256 pixelated CdTe semiconductor detector coupled to a Timepix
readout circuit. Analytical reconstruction methods, MURA Decoding, Wiener
Filter and a convolutional Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM)
algorithm were compared to data-driven Convolutional Encoder-Decoder (CED)
approaches. The comparison is based on the contrast-to-noise ratio as it has
been previously used to assess reconstruction quality. For the given set-up,
MURA Decoding, the most commonly used CAI reconstruction method, provides
robust reconstructions despite the assumption of a linear model. For single
image reconstruction, however, MLEM performed best among analytical
reconstruction methods, but took the longest with an average of 13s run time.
The fastest reconstruction method is the Wiener Filter with 67ms and mediocre
quality. The CED with a specifically tailored training set was able to succeed
the most commonly used MURA decoding on average by a factor between 1.37 and
2.60 and a run time of around 300ms.

service provider can proactively retrieve information from the information
source to update its data and users query the data at the service provider. One
example is crowdsensing-based applications. In order to keep users satisfied,
the application desires to provide users with fresh data, where the freshness
is measured by the Age-of-Information (AoI). However, maintaining fresh data
requires the application to update its database frequently, which incurs an
update cost (e.g., incentive payment). Hence, there exists a natural tradeoff
between the AoI and the update cost at the service provider who needs to make
update decisions. To capture this tradeoff, we formulate an optimization
problem with the objective of minimizing the total cost, which is the sum of
the staleness cost (which is a function of the AoI) and the update cost. Then,
we provide two useful guidelines for the design of efficient update policies.
Following these guidelines and assuming that the aggregated request arrival
process is Bernoulli, we prove that there exists a threshold-based policy that
is optimal among all online policies and thus focus on the class of
threshold-based policies. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form formula for
computing the long-term average cost under any threshold-based policy and
obtain the optimal threshold. Finally, we perform extensive simulations using
both synthetic data and real traces to verify our theoretical results and
demonstrate the superior performance of the optimal threshold-based policy

contributions. In 2011 M. de Gosson showed that the time-frequency
representation Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), which is the tool to define
modulation spaces, can be replaced by the Wigner distribution. This idea was
further generalized to $\tau$-Wigner representations in [9]. In this paper
time-frequency representations are viewed as images of symplectic matrices via
metaplectic operators. This new perspective highlights that the protagonists of
time-frequency analysis are metaplectic operators and symplectic matrices
$\mathcal{A} \in Sp(2d,\mathbb{R})$. We find conditions on $\mathcal{A}$ for
which the related symplectic time-frequency representation $W_\mathcal{A}$ can
replace the STFT and give equivalent norms for weighted modulation spaces. In
particular, we study the case of covariant matrices $\mathcal{A}$, i.e., their
corresponding $W_\mathcal{A}$ are members of the Cohen class.
  Finally, we show that symplectic time-frequency representations
$W_\mathcal{A}$ can be efficiently employed in the study of Schr\""{o}dinger

explicit set of neural network classifiers that achieve optimality. Since
effective neural networks in practice are typically both wide and deep, we
analyze infinitely wide networks that are also infinitely deep. In particular,
using the recent connection between infinitely wide neural networks and Neural
Tangent Kernels, we provide explicit activation functions that can be used to
construct networks that achieve optimality. Interestingly, these activation
functions are simple and easy to implement, yet differ from commonly used
activations such as ReLU or sigmoid. More generally, we create a taxonomy of
infinitely wide and deep networks and show that these models implement one of
three well-known classifiers depending on the activation function used: (1)
1-nearest neighbor (model predictions are given by the label of the nearest
training example); (2) majority vote (model predictions are given by the label
of the class with greatest representation in the training set); or (3) singular

geographic locations to provide low latency and high availability. The
Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a framework that provides a
principled approach to maintaining eventual consistency among data replicas.
CRDTs have been notoriously difficult to design and implement correctly. Subtle
deep bugs lie in the complex and tedious handling of all possible cases of
conflicting data updates. We argue that the CRDT design should be formally
specified and model-checked to uncover deep bugs. The implementation further
needs to be systematically tested. On the one hand, the testing needs to
inherit the exhaustive nature of the model checking and ensures the coverage of
testing. On the other hand, the testing is expected to find coding errors which
cannot be detected by design level verification.
  Towards the challenges above, we propose the Model Checking-driven
Explorative Testing (MET) framework. At the design level, MET uses TLA+ to
specify and model check CRDT designs. At the implementation level, MET conducts
model checking-driven explorative testing, in the sense that the test cases are
automatically generated from the model checking traces. The system execution is
controlled to proceed deterministically, following the model checking trace.
The explorative testing systematically controls and permutes all
nondeterministic message reorderings.
  We apply MET in our practical development of CRDTs. The bugs in both designs
and implementations of CRDTs are found. As for bugs which can be found by
traditional testing techniques, MET greatly reduces the cost of fixing the
bugs. Moreover, MET can find subtle deep bugs which cannot be found by existing
techniques at a reasonable cost. We further discuss how MET provides us with
sufficient confidence in the correctness of our CRDT designs and
implementations.

usage of this dataset by an application that automatically extracts a graph
representation from an SVC image. This is done by training a model via common
supervised learning methods. As there currently exist no large-scale public
datasets for the detailed analysis of SVC, we propose the Synthetic SVC (SSVC)
dataset comprising 12,000 images with respective bounding box annotations and
detailed graph representations. Our dataset enables the development of strong
models for the interpretation of SVCs while skipping the time-consuming dense
data annotation. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and manually annotated

given the presented application. Here, we evaluate that this proof of concept

discuss the limitations of our approach for further improvements. Our utilized

definitive answer is still missing. The hot Comptonizing corona interacting

BHXRBs, is essentially a dynamical system. Our aim is to investigate if the
radiative coupling between the two components can produce QPOs. We write and
solve the time-dependent equations that describe energy conservation in the
system corona - accretion disk. We examine both constant and variable mass
accretion rates. By necessity, in this first investigation we use a simple
model, but it contains all the essential ingredients. For a constant mass
accretion rate and certain justifiable conditions, the dynamic corona - disk
system exhibits oscillations, which die out after a few cycles. The
characteristic frequencies of these oscillations are similar to the ones
observed in the power spectra of BHXRBs. For most parameters, the natural
frequencies persist even in the case of variable accretion rates. We argue that
type-C QPOs in BHXRBs could, in principle, arise from the interaction of the
hot Comptonizing corona with the much colder accretion disk. If this picture is

Furthermore, we consider extensions to a spinful Rice-Mele model, namely a
staggered magnetic field or an Ising-type spin coupling, further reducing the
spin symmetry. The resulting models additionally allow for the transport of a
single charge in a two-component system of spinful fermions, whereas in the
absence of interactions, zero or two charges are pumped. In the SU(2)-symmetric

an integer amount of spin while the Ising term realizes a pure charge pump. We
employ real-time simulations in finite and infinite systems to calculate the

the many-body polarization to confirm the adiabatic nature of the pump. The

approaches to formulate the control problem as nonlinear optimization problems.
Increasing the number of scenarios improves robustness, while increasing the

reducing the number of scenarios requires knowledge about how the uncertainty
affects the system. This paper draws from local reduction methods used in
semi-infinite optimization to solve robust optimal control problems with
parametric uncertainty. We show that nonlinear robust optimal control problems
are equivalent to semi-infinite optimization problems and can be solved by
local reduction. By iteratively adding interim globally worst-case scenarios to
the problem, methods based on local reduction provide a way to manage the total
number of scenarios. In particular, we show that local reduction methods find
worst case scenarios that are not on the boundary of the uncertainty set. The
proposed approach is illustrated with a case study with both parametric and
additive time-varying uncertainty. The number of scenarios obtained from local
reduction is 101, smaller than in the case when all $2^{14+3\times192}$

shows that our proposed approach reduces the number of scenarios and ensures
robustness even if local solvers are used.

introduces a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for forward fitting
STIX visibilities and compares its effectiveness with respect to the standard
simplex-based optimization algorithm used so far for the analysis of
visibilities measured by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI). This comparison is made by considering experimental
visibilities measured by both RHESSI and STIX, and synthetic visibilities
generated by accounting for the STIX signal formation model. Results. We found
out that the parametric imaging approach based on PSO is as reliable as the one
based on the simplex method in the case of RHESSI visibilities. However, PSO is
significantly more robust when applied to STIX simulated and experimental
visibilities. Conclusions. Standard deterministic optimization is not effective
enough for forward-fitting the few visibilities sampled by STIX in the angular
frequency plane. Therefore a more sofisticated optimization scheme must be
introduced for parametric imaging in the case of the Solar Orbiter X-ray
telescope. The forward-fitting routine based on PSO we introduced in this paper
proved to be significantly robust and reliable, and could be considered as an
effective candidate tool for parametric imaging in the STIX context.

end, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is proposed as a promising solution
to improve spectral efficiency and provide better fairness for the
next-generation mobile networks. In this paper, the outage performance of
uplink RSMA transmission with randomly deployed users is investigated, taking
both user scheduling schemes and power allocation strategies into
consideration. Specifically, the greedy user scheduling (GUS) and cumulative
distribution function (CDF) based user scheduling (CUS) schemes are considered,
which could maximize the rate performance and guarantee scheduling fairness,
respectively. Meanwhile, we re-investigate cognitive power allocation (CPA)
strategy, and propose a new rate fairness-oriented power allocation (FPA)
strategy to enhance the scheduled users' rate fairness. By employing order
statistics and stochastic geometry, an analytical expression of the outage
probability for each scheduling scheme combining power allocation is derived to
characterize the performance. To get more insights, the achieved diversity
order of each scheme is also derived. Theoretical results demonstrate that both
GUS and CUS schemes applying CPA or FPA strategy can achieve full diversity
orders, and the application of CPA strategy in RSMA can effectively eliminate
the secondary user's diversity order constraint from the primary user.
Simulation results corroborate the accuracy of the analytical expressions, and
show that the proposed FPA strategy can achieve excellent rate fairness

crosslink radiometric measurements applied to a future lunar CubeSat mission to
clearly highlight its advantages with respect to existing ground-based

Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) method which provides an
autonomous navigation solution solely using satellite-to-satellite
measurements, such as range and/or range-rate, to estimate absolute spacecraft
states when at least one of the involved spacecraft has an orbit with a unique
size, shape, and orientation. The lunar vicinity is a perfect candidate for
this type of application due to the asymmetrical gravity field: the selected
lunar mission, an Earth-Moon L2 (EML2) Halo orbiter, has an inter-satellite
link between a lunar elliptical frozen orbiter. Simulation results show that,
even in case of high-measurement errors (in the order of 100 m, 1 sigma, the
navigation filter estimates the true states of spacecraft at EML2 with an error
in the order of 500 m for position, and 2 mm/s for velocity, respectively and
the elliptical lunar frozen orbiter states can be estimated in the order of 100
m for position and 1 cm/s for velocity, respectively. This study shows that
range-only measurements provide better state estimation than range-rate-only
measurements for this specific situation. Different bias handling strategies
are also investigated. It has been found that even a less accurate ranging
method, such as data-aided ranging, provides a sufficient orbit determination
solution. This would simplify the communication system design for the selected
CubeSat mission. The most observable states are found to be position states of
the lunar orbiter via the observability analysis. In addition, the best
tracking windows are also investigated for the selected mission scenario.

novel approach for controlling material properties through laser-dressing, as
well as for ultrafast spectroscopy via nonlinear light-matter interactions

advancements is that it is sometimes vague which band-picture should be used to
interpret strong-field experiments: the field-free bands, the adiabatic
(instantaneous) field-dressed bands, Floquet bands, or some other intermediate
picture. We here try to resolve this issue by performing 'theoretical
experiments' of time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES)
for a strong-field laser-pumped solid, which should give access to the actual
observable bands of the irradiated material. To our surprise, we find that the
adiabatic band-picture survives quite well, up to high field intensities
(~10^12 W/cm^2), and in a wide frequency range (driving wavelengths of 4000 to
800nm, with Keldysh parameters ranging up to ~7). We conclude that to first
order, the adiabatic instantaneous bands should be the standard blueprint for
interpreting ultrafast electron dynamics in solids when the field is highly
off-resonant with characteristic energy scales of the material. We then discuss
weaker effects of modifications of the bands beyond this picture that are
non-adiabatic, showing that by using bi-chromatic fields the deviations from
the standard picture can be probed with enhanced sensitivity. Our work outlines
a clear band picture for the physics of strong-field interactions in solids,
which should be useful for designing and analyzing strong-field experimental
observables and also to formulate simpler semi-empirical models.

We report observations of 2M0632, an M dwarf member of the Carina young moving
group that was observed by TESS over two one-year intervals. The combined light
curve contains >300 dimming events, each lasting a few hours, and as deep as
40% (0.55 magnitudes). These stochastic events are correlated with a distinct,
stable 1.86-day periodic signal that could be stellar rotation. Concurrent
ground-based, multi-band photometry show reddening consistent with ISM-like
dust. The star's excess emission in the infrared and emission lines in optical
and infrared spectra, reveal a T Tauri-like accretion disk around the star. We
confirm membership of 2M0632 in the Carina group by a Bayesian analysis of its
Galactic space motion and position. We combine stellar evolution models with
Gaia photometry and constraints on Teff, luminosity, and the absence of
detectable lithium in the photosphere to constrain the age of the group and
2M0632 to 40-60 Myr, consistent with earlier estimates. 2M0632 joins a handful
of long-lived disks which challenge the canon that disk lifetimes are <10 Myr.
All known examples surround M dwarfs, suggesting that lower X-ray/UV
irradiation and slower photoevaporation by these stars can dramatically affect
disk evolution. The multi-planet systems spawned by long-lived disks probably
experienced significant orbital damping and migration into close-in, resonant
orbits, and perhaps represented by the TRAPPIST-1 system.

introduced to represent interaction of the ions with a solid wall. Finally, the

commit-and-open strategy. Our protocol uses high-dimensional quantum states to
obliviously compute the linear function, $f (x)$, on Galois Fields of prime

of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases in prime-power dimension Hilbert

for the first time in this domain, employs an Evolutionary Computation
paradigm: EASGS. EASGS effectively searches the huge SGS solution space via
suitable solution encoding in a chromosome and a specially-designed set of
operators. The operators include three types of mutations, each focusing on a
particular aspect of the SGS solution, optimized crossover and a local coverage
improvement scheme (a memetic aspect of EASGS). We also introduce a new set of
benchmark games, based on dense or locally-dense graphs that reflect real-world
SGS settings. In the majority of 342 test game instances, EASGS outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, including a reinforcement learning method, in terms
of time scalability, nearly constant memory utilization, and quality of the
returned defender's strategies (expected payoffs).

are expected to fill the gap in terms of the first two aspects (i.e., higher

a wide open challenge. All is well when everything works but when there is a
failure or a security attack, the entire system collapses exposing the
associated human lives to imminent danger. Avoiding this requires the strongest
of assurances that safety and security aspects are protected no matter what.
Large scale critical applications are waiting for this piece of the puzzle to
be solved. At this juncture, we envision the bold theme of La R\'esistance 6G

services over 6G networks. It aims to achieve ultra-high reliability and
resiliency to any disruptions, be it failures or security attacks. A few
disruptions are easy to handle such as a cloud VM or primary link failure. In
both of these cases, applications can be restored by activating the standby

cut-vertex fails or when the disruption leaves the critical application to fail
without access to a standby resource. These critical applications (e.g. Smart

materials, and have been studied extensively over many decades. In this
article, a theoretical framework is presented that extends existing theories by
placing the surrounding solution environment on an equal footing with the
crystal itself; this is advantageous, e.g., when considering processes such as
crystal growth from solution. By considering the polar crystal as a stack of
parallel plate capacitors immersed in a solution environment, the equilibrium
adsorbed surface charge density is derived by minimizing the free energy of the
system. In analogy to the well-known diverging surface energy of a polar
crystal surface at zero temperature, for a crystal in solution it is shown that
the ""polar catastrophe"" manifests as a diverging free energy cost to perturb
the system from equilibrium. Going further than existing theories, the present
formulation predicts that fluctuations in the adsorbed surface charge density
become increasingly suppressed with increasing crystal thickness. We also show
how, in the slab geometry often employed in both theoretical and computational
studies of interfaces, an electric displacement field emerges as an
electrostatic boundary condition, the origins of which are rooted in the slab
geometry itself, rather than the use of periodic boundary conditions. This
aspect of the work provides a firmer theoretical basis for the recent

loudness in the field and in the laboratory of 36 driving actions done by four
different vehicles. The field measurements were done in a restricted street and

worldwide, deep learning (DL) algorithms-based electroencephalograph (EEG)
analysis provides the possibility for accurate epileptic seizure (ES)
prediction, thereby benefiting patients suffering from epilepsy. To identify
the preictal region that precedes the onset of seizure, a large number of
annotated EEG signals are required to train DL algorithms. However, the
scarcity of seizure onsets leads to significant insufficiency of data for
training the DL algorithms. To overcome this data insufficiency, in this paper,
we propose a preictal artificial signal synthesis algorithm based on a
generative adversarial network to generate synthetic multichannel EEG preictal
samples. A high-quality single-channel architecture, determined by visual and
statistical evaluations, is used to train the generators of multichannel
samples. The effectiveness of the synthetic samples is evaluated by comparing
the ES prediction performances without and with synthetic preictal sample
augmentation. The leave-one-seizure-out cross validation ES prediction accuracy
and corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
evaluation improve from 73.0\% and 0.676 to 78.0\% and 0.704 by 10$\times$
synthetic sample augmentation, respectively. The obtained results indicate that
synthetic preictal samples are effective for enhancing ES prediction
performance.

low-cost tools for improving signal propagation in wireless communications. An
RIS assists a base station in optimizing the channel and maximizing its
capacity by dynamically manipulating with reflected field. Typically, RISs are
based on dynamically reconfigurable reflectarrays, i.e. two-dimensional arrays
of passive patch antennas, individually switchable between two or more
reflection phases. Different communication scenarios and environments require
RISs to provide a different spatial resolution of reflected field patterns,
which depends on the aperture dimensions and the number of patches. Here we
demonstrate a 1-bit RIS for 5-GHz Wi-Fi band made by assembling together
multiple independently operating building blocks all powered by the same DC
source. Each block contains four separately phase-switchable patch antennas
with varactor diodes and a common microcontroller extracting digital control
commands from modulated infrared light illuminating the entire RIS. Such
distributed light-sensitive controllers grant the possibility of scaling the
aperture by adding or removing blocks without re-designing any control
circuitry. Moreover, in the proposed RIS a full 2D phase encoding capability is
achieved along with a robust remote infrared control.

stable rectifying device with the possibility of commercialization is a ""holy
grail"" of molecular electronics. Molecular rectifiers do not only exploit the
electronic function of the molecules but also offer the possibility of their
direct integration into specific nano-electronic circuits. However, even after
nearly three decades of extensive experimental and theoretical work, the
concept of molecular rectifiers still has many unresolved aspects concerning
both the fundamental understanding of the underlying phenomena and the
practical realization. At the same time, recent advancements in molecular
systems with rectification ratios exceeding 105 are highly promising and
competitive to the existing silicon-based devices. Here, we provide an overview
and critical analysis of the current state and recent progress in molecular
rectification relying on the different design concepts and material platforms
such as single molecules, self-assembled monolayers, molecular multilayers,
heterostructures, and metal-organic frameworks and coordination polymers. The
involvement of crucial parameters such as the energy of molecular orbitals,
electrode-molecule coupling, and asymmetric shifting of the energy levels will
be discussed. Finally, we conclude by critically addressing the challenges and
prospects for progress in the field and perspectives for the commercialization
of molecular rectifiers.

the anisotropic diffusion equations with deep neural networks. For many
numerical schemes, the accurate approximation of anisotropic heat flux is
crucial for the overall accuracy. In this work, the heat flux is firstly
decomposed into two components along the two eigenvectors of the diffusion
tensor, thus the anisotropic heat flux approximation is converted into the
approximation of two isotropic components.
  Moreover, to handle the possible jump of the diffusion tensor across the
interface, the weighted first-order formulation is obtained by multiplying this
first-order formulation by a weighted function. By the decaying property of the
weighted function, the weighted first-order formulation is always well-defined
in the pointwise way. Finally, the weighted first-order formulation is solved
with deep neural network approximation. Compared to the neural network
approximation with the original second-order elliptic formulation, the proposed
method can significantly improve the accuracy, especially for the discontinuous
anisotropic diffusion problems.

those of semi-sectorial matrices, which are possibly singular. Properties of
the phases are also extended, including those of the Moore-Penrose generalized

particular, a majorization relation is established between the phases of the
nonzero eigenvalues of $AB$ and the phases of the compressions of $A$ and $B$,
which leads to a generalized matrix small phase theorem. For the matrices which
are not necessarily semi-sectorial, we define their (largest and smallest)
essential phases via diagonal similarity transformation. An explicit expression

improve the training efficiency for the solutions with steep gradients. A
series of experiment comparisons between the RAR-PINN and traditional PINN

algorithm has faster convergence rate and better approximation ability,
especially in modeling the shape-changing vector-soliton interactions in the

frequently used as examples of birefringent materials in textbooks and
classroom demonstrations. Qualitatively, birefringence is often demonstrated by
layering such films between crossed-polarizers. In this work, we describe an
inexpensive experimental setup for the quantitative measurement of
birefringence in common household films, suitable for senior high school or
undergraduate labs. Whereas traditional approaches for polarization-based
classroom experiments typically use monochromatic laser light, we encourage the
combined use of an incoherent incandescent light source and portable
spectrometer. In addition, we demonstrate how any concomitant thin-film
interference effects can be used to separately measure the optical thickness in
the most heterogeneous and uniform films. Such measurement can then be used as
an independent experimental confirmation of either the film's index of
refraction or its thickness, given knowledge of the other. In an effort to
provide examples for the data analysis procedures as well as to investigate a
range of materials, we measure the birefringence across the visible spectrum of
six common household polymer films, including thin kitchen wrap, cellophane,
gift basket film, and common adhesive tapes.
