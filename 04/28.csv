the isotopic fractionation associated with laser-heating aerodynamic levitation
experiments is consistent with the velocity of flowing gas as the primary
control on the fractionation. The new Fe and Mg isotope data are well explained
where the gas is treated as a low-viscosity fluid that flows around the molten
spheres with high Reynolds numbers and minimal drag. A relationship between the
ratio of headwind velocity to thermal velocity and saturation is obtained on
the basis of this analysis. The recognition that it is the ratio of flow
velocity to thermal velocity that controls fractionation allows for
extrapolation to other environments in which molten rock encounters gas with
appreciable headwinds. In this way, in some circumstances, the degree of
isotope fractionation attending evaporation is as much a velocimeter as it is a
barometer.

has been collected, filtered and carefully annotated by dialogue NLU experts,

mechanical stabilities of the RN-AF in both the Gibbs-Boltzmann (GB) and the
alternative R\'enyi statistics when charge $q$ and electrostatic potential
$\phi$ are treated as pressure and volume, respectively. Interestingly, the
emergent phase of the RN-AF can be both thermodynamically and mechanically
stable in some range of parameters in the framework of R\'enyi thermodynamics.
With the construction of the Maxwell equal area law in $q-\phi$ plane, the
coexistence line between the near-extremal black hole phase and the emergent
phase can be found in some values of charge which can be associated as the
vapor pressure at which the liquid and gas phases coexist. In the aspect of
thermodynamic geometry, the microscopic interaction between the black hole
microstructures can be repulsive in the R\'enyi description. This implies that
a novel correlation between the microstates of a self-gravitating system could
be emerged via the nonextensive nature of long-range interaction systems.
Finally, we also investigate the critical phenomena of the RN-AF in R\'enyi
statistics compared to that of the van der Waals (vdW) fluid and find that the
critical exponents of the relevant physical quantities of both systems are
identical. This implies that both systems are in the same universality class of

comprising contributions from each individual configurational state, which
together sum to a baseline heat capacity, and contributions from each
state-to-state transition. We apply this analysis framework to a series of
replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of linear and 1-1
coarse-grained homo-oligomer models which fold into stable, configurationally
well-defined molecular knots, in order to better understand the parameters
leading to stable and cooperative folding of these knots. We find that a stiff
harmonic backbone bending angle potential is key to achieving knots with
specific 3D structures. Tuning the backbone equilibrium angle in small
increments yields a variety of knot topologies, including $3_1$, $5_1$, $7_1$,
and $8_{19}$ types. Populations of different knotted states as functions of
temperature can also be manipulated by tuning backbone torsion stiffness or by
adding side chain beads. We find that sharp total heat capacity peaks for the
homo-oligomer knots are largely due to a coil-to-globule transition, rather
than a cooperative knotting step. However, in some cases the cooperativity of
globule-to-knot and coil-to-globule transitions are comparable, suggesting that
highly cooperative folding to knotted structures can be achieved by refining
the model parameters or adding sequence specificity.

technologies for the next generation of wireless communications. It is
envisioned to enhance the signal coverage in cases when the direct link of the
communication is weak. Recently, beam training based on codebook selection is
proposed to obtain the optimized phase configuration of the RIS. After that,
the data is transmitted and received by using the classical coherent
demodulation scheme (CDS). This training approach is able to avoid the large
overhead required by the channel sounding process, and it also circumvents
complex optimization problems. However, the beam training still requires the
transmission of some reference signals to test the different phase
configurations of the codebook, and the best codeword is chosen according to
the measurement of the received energy of the reference signals. Then, the
overhead due to the transmission of reference signals reduces the spectral
efficiency. In this paper, a zero overhead beam training for RIS is proposed,
relying on data transmission and reception based on non-CDS (NCDS). At the BS,
the received differential data can also be used for the determination of the
best beam for the RIS. Therefore, the efficiency of the system is significantly
enhanced since reference signals are fully avoided. After choosing the best
codebook, NCDS is still more suitable to transmit information for high mobility
scenarios as compared to the classical CDS. Analytical expressions for the
Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) for the non-coherent
RIS-empowered system are presented. Moreover, a detailed comparison between the
NCDS and CDS in terms of efficiency and complexity is also given. The extensive
computer simulation results verify the accuracy of the presented analysis and
showcase that the proposed system outperforms the existing solutions.

large signals from relatively few measurements by exploiting known structures

sensing's vast repertoire of applications in areas such as communications and
image reconstruction stems from the traditional approach of utilizing
non-linear optimization to exploit the sparsity assumption by selecting the
lowest-weight (i.e. maximum sparsity) signal consistent with all acquired
measurements. Recent efforts in the literature consider instead a data-driven
approach, training tensor networks to learn the structure of signals of
interest. The trained tensor network is updated to ""project"" its state onto one
consistent with the measurements taken, and is then sampled site by site to
""guess"" the original signal. In this paper, we take advantage of this computing
protocol by formulating an alternative ""quantum"" protocol, in which the state
of the tensor network is a quantum state over a set of entangled qubits.
Accordingly, we present the associated algorithms and quantum circuits required
to implement the training, projection, and sampling steps on a quantum

coordinates, density distributions and mean gravitational potential are
considered to be independent of $x$ and $y$ and to be a function of $z$,
symmetric with respect to the $z = 0$ plane) in the context of the general
issues related to the role of weak collisionality in inhomogeneous
self-gravitating stellar systems. We thus consider the two-component case, that
is a system of heavy and light stars with assigned mass ratio ($\mu$) and
assigned global relative abundance ($\alpha$; the ratio of the total mass of
the heavy and light stars). The system is imagined to start from an initial
condition in which the two species are well mixed and have identical spatial
and velocity distributions and to evolve into a final configuration in which
collisions have generated equipartition and mass segregation. Initial and final
distribution functions are assumed to be Maxwellian. Application of mass and
energy conservation allows us to derive the properties of the final state from
the assumed initial conditions. In general, the derivation of these properties
requires a simple numerical integration of the Poisson equation. Curiously, the
case in which the heavy stars are exactly twice as massive as the light stars
($\mu = 2$) turns out to admit a relatively simple analytic solution. Although
the general framework of this investigation is relatively straightforward, some
non-trivial issues related to energy conservation and the possible use of a
virial constraint are noted and clarified. The formulation and the results of
this paper prepare the way to future studies in which the evolution induced by
weak collisionality will be followed either by considering the action of
standard collision operators or by means of dedicated numerical simulations.

by their nature as circuit description languages, involve two runtimes: one at
which the program generates a circuit and one at which the circuit is executed,
normally with probabilistic results due to measurements. Accordingly, the
language distinguishes two kinds of data: parameters, which are known at
circuit generation time, and states, which are known at circuit execution time.
Sometimes, it is desirable for the results of measurements to control the
generation of the next part of the circuit. Therefore, the language needs to
turn states, such as measurement outcomes, into parameters, an operation we
call dynamic lifting. The goal of this paper is to model this interaction
between the runtimes by providing a general categorical structure enriched in
what we call ""bisets"". We demonstrate that the biset-enriched structure
achieves a proper semantics of the two runtimes and their interaction, by
showing that it models a variant of Proto-Quipper with dynamic lifting. The
present paper deals with the concrete categorical semantics of this language,
whereas a companion paper [FKRS2022a] deals with the syntax, type system,
operational semantics, and abstract categorical semantics.

conformations and dynamics. However, conventional simulation suffers from being
trapped in some local energy minima that are hard to escape. Thus, most
computational time is spent sampling in the already visited regions. This leads
to an inefficient sampling process and further hinders the exploration of
protein movements in affordable simulation time. The advancement of deep
learning provides new opportunities for protein sampling. Variational
autoencoders are a class of deep learning models to learn a low-dimensional
representation (referred to as the latent space) that can capture the key
features of the input data. Based on this characteristic, we proposed a new
adaptive sampling method, latent space assisted adaptive sampling for protein
trajectories (LAST), to accelerate the exploration of protein conformational
space. This method comprises cycles of (i) variational autoencoders training,
(ii) seed structure selection on the latent space and (iii) conformational
sampling through additional MD simulations. The proposed approach is validated
through the sampling of four structures of two protein systems: two metastable
states of E. Coli adenosine kinase (ADK) and two native states of Vivid (VVD).
In all four conformations, seed structures were shown to lie on the boundary of
conformation distributions. Moreover, large conformational changes were
observed in a shorter simulation time when compared with conventional MD (cMD)
simulations in both systems. In metastable ADK simulations, LAST explored two
transition paths toward two stable states while cMD became trapped in an energy
basin. In VVD light state simulations, LAST was three times faster than cMD
simulation with a similar conformational space.

Proto-Quipper is a family of languages aiming to provide a formal foundation

description language, Proto-Quipper has two separate runtimes: circuit
generation time and circuit execution time. Values that are known at circuit
generation time are called parameters, and values that are known at circuit
execution time are called states. Dynamic lifting is an operation that enables
a state, such as the result of a measurement, to be lifted to a parameter,
where it can influence the generation of the next portion of the circuit. As a
result, dynamic lifting enables Proto-Quipper programs to interleave classical
and quantum computation. We describe the syntax of a language we call
Proto-Quipper-Dyn. Its type system uses a system of modalities to keep track of
the use of dynamic lifting. We also provide an operational semantics, as well
as an abstract categorical semantics for dynamic lifting based on enriched

therefore, key. However, as is the case in general with AIIAs, it is especially
challenging to assess and control the quality of chatbot systems. Beyond the
inherent statistical nature of these systems, where occasional failure is
acceptable, we identify two major challenges. The first is to release an
initial system that is of sufficient quality such that humans will interact
with it. The second is to maintain the quality, enhance its capabilities,
improve it and make necessary adjustments based on changing user requests or
drift. These challenges exist because it is impossible to predict the real

these requests. Moreover, any empirical distribution of requests is likely to
change over time. This may be due to periodicity, changing usage, and drift of

are obtained based on the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). Then, using
thermodynamic geometry, we show that the microstructure of black holes can be
determined by the ratio of GUP parameter to charge. For a small ratio, the
black hole exhibits the typical RN-AdS microstructure with van der Waals phase
transition and repulsive/attractive interactions. As the ratio increases, the
reentrant phase transition takes place, and both the repulsion-attraction
coexisted black hole and the attraction dominated black hole can be found in
this case. For a large ratio, the black hole behaves like a Schwarzchild-AdS
black hole in which neither phase transition nor repulsive interaction exists.
These results suggest that the GUP effect will reduce the repulsive interaction
presented by the charged AdS black hole, which can also be qualitatively
understood from the perspective of black hole molecules.

particularly challenging and can only be achieved via all-sky monitoring

objects. The Fermi-LAT satellite, thanks to its monitoring observing strategy,
is an ideal instrument for such a goal. Here, we aim to identify QPOs in the

Instead, they attempt to get the end-user to perform some other action, for
example, transferring money from their bank account to the mal-actors account.
These attacks are rarer, and before-the-click defence has been investigated
less than after-the-click defence. To better integrate and contextualize these

(CCSD) for the study of core excitations and ionizations of 18 small organic
molecules, without any use of response theory or equation-of-motion formalisms.
Three schemes are employed to successfully address the convergence difficulties
associated with the coupled-cluster equations, and the spin contamination
resulting from the use of a spin symmetry-broken reference, in the case of
excitations. In order to gauge the inherent potential of the methods studied,
an effort is made to provide reasonable basis set limit estimates for the
transition energies. Overall, we find that the two best-performing schemes
studied here for Delta-CCSD are capable of predicting excitation and ionization
energies with errors comparable to experimental accuracies. The proposed
Delta-CCSD schemes seem to fare better than the widely used equation-of-motion
CCSD (EOM-CCSD) with core-valence separation protocol, with statistical errors
being reduced by more than a factor of two when compared to FC-CVS-EOM-CCSD.

  Unreliable Sensors using Linear Temporal Logic",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the diagnosability verification problem of
partially-observed discrete-event systems (DES) subject to unreliable sensors.
In this setting, upon the occurrence of each event, the sensor reading may be
non-deterministic due to measurement noises or possible sensor failures.
Existing works on this topic mainly consider specific types of unreliable
sensors such as the cases of intermittent sensors failures, permanent sensor
failures or their combinations. In this work, we propose a novel \emph{uniform
framework} for diagnosability of DES subject to, not only sensor failures, but
also a very general class of unreliable sensors. Our approach is to use linear
temporal logic (LTL) with semantics on infinite traces to describe the possible
behaviors of the sensors. A new notion of $\varphi$-diagnosability is proposed
as the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a diagnoser when
the behaviors of sensors satisfy the LTL formula $\varphi$. Effective approach
is provided to verify this notion. We show that, our new notion of
$\varphi$-diagnosability subsumes all existing notions of robust diagnosability
of DES subject to sensor failures. Furthermore, the proposed framework is
user-friendly and flexible since it supports an arbitrary user-defined
unreliable sensor type based on the specific scenario of the application. As
examples, we provide two new notions of diagnosability, which have never been
investigated in the literature, using our uniform framework.

observations from the Parker Solar Probe of a sheath observed at 0.5 au in
March 2019, ahead of a slow streamer blowout CME. To examine the MHD-scale
turbulent properties, we calculated fluctuation amplitudes, magnetic
compressibility, partial variance of increments (PVI), cross helicity
($\sigma_c$), residual energy ($\sigma_r$), and the Jensen-Shannon permutation
entropy and complexity. The sheath consisted of slow and fast flows separated
by a 15-min change in magnetic sector that coincided with current sheet
crossings and a velocity shear zone. Fluctuation amplitudes and PVI were
greater through the sheath than upstream. Fluctuations had mostly negative
$\sigma_r$ and positive $\sigma_c$ in the sheath, the latter indicating an
anti-sunward sense of propagation. The velocity shear region marked an increase
in temperature and specific entropy, and the faster flow behind had local
patches of positive $\sigma_r$ as well as higher fluctuation amplitudes and
PVI. Fluctuations in the preceding wind and sheath were stochastic, with the
sheath fluctuations showing lower entropy and higher complexity than upstream.
The two-part sheath structure likely resulted from a warp in the heliospheric
current sheet (HCS) being swept up and compressed. The ejecta accelerated and
heated the wind at the sheath rear, which then interacted with the slower wind
ahead of the HCS warp. This caused differences in fluctuation properties across
the sheath. Sheaths of slow ICMEs can thus have complex structure where
fluctuation properties are not just downstream shock properties, but are
generated within the sheath.

in long-term memory even after a single exposure, as demonstrated by classic
experiments in psychology. For example, Standing (1973) showed that humans
could recognize with high accuracy thousands of pictures that they had seen

learning via gradient descent require approximately 10 exposures to the same
visual materials in order to reach a recognition memory performance humans
achieve after only a single exposure. Prior knowledge induced via pretraining
and bigger model sizes improve performance, but these improvements are not very
visible after a single exposure (it takes a few exposures for the improvements

numerous applications including augmented and virtual reality. Existing

Our algorithm is agnostic to object models, and it learns the physical rules
governing hand-object interaction. This requires automatically inferring the

seek to approach this challenging problem by proposing a collaborative learning
strategy where two-branches of deep networks are learning from each other.
Specifically, we transfer hand mesh information to the object branch and vice
versa for the hand branch. The resulting optimisation (training) problem can be
unstable, and we address this via two strategies: (i) attention-guided graph
convolution which helps identify and focus on mutual occlusion and (ii)
unsupervised associative loss which facilitates the transfer of information
between the branches. Experiments using four widely-used benchmarks show that
our framework achieves beyond state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D pose estimation,

have been originally introduced by Guruswami and Xing in 2013 to give the first
construction of positive rate rank-metric codes list decodable beyond half the
distance. However, sets of subspaces with special pattern of intersections with
other subspaces have been already studied, such as spreads, generalised arcs
and caps, and Cameron-Liebler sets. In this paper we provide bounds involving
the dimension of the subspaces forming a subspace design and the parameters of
the ambient space, showing constructions satisfying the equality in such
bounds. Then we also introduce two dualities relations among them. Among
subspace designs, those that we call s-designs are central in this paper, as
they generalize the notion of s-scattered subspace to subspace design and for
their special properties. Indeed, we prove that, for certain values of s, they
correspond to the optimal subspace designs, that is those subspace designs that
are associated with linear maximum sum-rank metric codes. Special attention has
been paid for the case s=1 for which we provide several examples, yielding
surprising to families of two-intersection sets with respect to hyperplanes
(and hence two-weight linear codes). Moreover, s-designs can be used to
construct explicit lossless dimension expanders (a linear-algebraic analogue of
expander graphs), without any restriction on the order of the field. Another
class of subspace designs we study is those of cutting designs, since they
extend the notion of cutting blocking set recently introduced by Bonini and
Borello. These designs turn out to be very interesting as they in one-to-one
correspondence with minimal sum-rank metric codes. The latter codes have been
introduced in this paper and they naturally extend the notions of minimal codes

research on hierarchical control in head-to-head autonomous racing by
considering a generalized version of the problem while maintaining the
two-level hierarchical control structure. A high-level tactical planner
constructs a discrete game that encodes the complex rules using simplified
dynamics to produce a sequence of target waypoints. The low-level path planner
uses these waypoints as a reference trajectory and computes high-resolution
control inputs by solving a simplified formulation of a racing game with a
simplified representation of the realistic racing rules. We explore two
approaches for the low-level path planner: training a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) policy and solving a linear-quadratic Nash game (LQNG)
approximation. We evaluate our controllers on simple and complex tracks against
three baselines: an end-to-end MARL controller, a MARL controller tracking a
fixed racing line, and an LQNG controller tracking a fixed racing line.
Quantitative results show our hierarchical methods outperform the baselines in
terms of race wins, overall team performance, and compliance with the rules.
Qualitatively, we observe the hierarchical controllers mimic actions performed
by expert human drivers such as coordinated overtaking, defending against
multiple opponents, and long-term planning for delayed advantages.

density field of dispersed gas-droplet flows modelled using the Fully
Lagrangian Approach (FLA). In this work, the nonparametric framework of kernel
regression is used to accumulate the FLA number density contributions of
individual droplets in accordance with the spatial structure of the dispersed
phase. The high variation which is observed in the droplet number density field
for unsteady flows is accounted for by using the Eulerian-Lagrangian
transformation tensor, which is central to the FLA, to specify the size and
shape of the kernel associated with each droplet. This procedure enables a high
level of structural detail to be retained, and it is demonstrated that far
fewer droplets have to be tracked in order to reconstruct a faithful Eulerian
representation of the dispersed phase. Furthermore, the kernel regression
procedure is easily extended to higher dimensions, and inclusion of the droplet
radius within the phase space description additionally enables the droplet size
distribution and its statistics, such as average and variance, to be determined
for polydisperse flows. The developed methodology is applied to a range of 1D
and 2D steady-state and transient flows, for both monodisperse and polydisperse
droplets, and it is shown that kernel regression performs well across this
variety of cases. A comparison is made against conventional direct trajectory
methods to determine the saving in computational expense which can be gained,
and it is found that $10^3$ times fewer droplet realisations are needed to
reconstruct a qualitatively similar representation of the number density field
in which the absolute error is generally below $10^{-1}$.

conductive domain walls is largely limited to wide-gap ferroelectrics, where
the conductivity typically arises from changes in charge carrier density, due
to screening charge accumulation at polar discontinuities. This work shows
that, in narrow-gap correlated insulators with strong charge lattice coupling,
local strain gradients can drive enhanced conductivity at the domain walls,
removing polar discontinuities as a criteria for conductivity. By combining
different scanning probe microscopy techniques, we demonstrate that the domain
wall conductivity in GaV4S8 does not follow the established screening charge

Jahn-Teller transition and the associated strain gradients across the domain

assumed that large-scale, strong magnetic flux emerges from the Sun's deep
interior in the form of arched, cylindrical structures, colloquially known as
flux tubes. Here, we continue to examine the different dynamics encountered
when these structures are considered as concentrations in a volume-filling
magnetic field rather than as isolated entities in a field-free background. Via
2.5D numerical simulations, we consider the buoyant rise of magnetic flux
concentrations from a radiative zone through an overshooting convection zone
that self-consistently (via magnetic pumping) arranges a volume-filling
large-scale background field. This work extends earlier papers that considered
the evolution of such structures in a purely adiabatic stratification with an
assumed form of the background field. This earlier work established the
existence of a bias that created an increased likelihood of successful rise for
magnetic structures with one (relative) orientation of twist and a decreased
likelihood for the other. When applied to the solar context, this bias is
commensurate with the solar hemispherical helicity rules (SHHR). This paper
establishes the robustness of this selection mechanism in a model incorporating
a more realistic background state, consisting of overshooting convection and a
turbulently-pumped mean magnetic field. Ultimately, convection only weakly
influences the selection mechanism, since it is enacted at the initiation of
the rise, at the edge of the overshoot zone. Convection does however add
another layer of statistical fluctuations to the bias, which we investigate in
order to explain variations in the SHHR.

alternative possibility is that the cosmic ray age distribution is broader than

calibration error could be $\Omega(1)$. Inspired by the equally seminal works

the forecaster the option of making two nearby probabilistic forecasts, or
equivalently an interval forecast of small width, and the endpoint closest to

variational objective and Hinf-norm based correction for a linear Gaussian

Kalman update with the dense covariance matrix for a large scale system
requires increased storage and computational complexity, making it impractical.
The VIF approach, based on mean-field Gaussian variational inference, reduces
this burden through the variational approximation to the covariance usually in
the form of a diagonal covariance approximation. The challenge is to retain
convergence and correct for biases introduced by the sequential VIF steps. We
desire a framework that improves feasibility while still maintaining reasonable
proximity to the optimal Kalman filter as data is assimilated. To accomplish
this goal, a Hinf-norm based optimization perturbs the VIF covariance matrix to
improve robustness. This yields a novel VIF- Hinf recursion that employs
consecutive variational inference and Hinf based optimization steps. We explore
the development of this method and investigate a numerical example to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter.

challenges remain: (1) 3D ground-truth meshes of clothing are usually
inaccessible due to annotation difficulties and time costs; (2) Conventional
template-based methods are limited to modeling non-rigid objects, e.g.,
handbags and dresses, which are common in fashion images; (3) The inherent
ambiguity compromises the model training, such as the dilemma between a large
shape with a remote camera or a small shape with a close camera.
  In an attempt to address the above limitations, we propose a causality-aware
self-supervised learning method to adaptively reconstruct 3D non-rigid objects
from 2D images without 3D annotations. In particular, to solve the inherent
ambiguity among four implicit variables, i.e., camera position, shape, texture,
and illumination, we introduce an explainable structural causal map (SCM) to
build our model. The proposed model structure follows the spirit of the causal
map, which explicitly considers the prior template in the camera estimation and
shape prediction. When optimization, the causality intervention tool, i.e., two
expectation-maximization loops, is deeply embedded in our algorithm to (1)
disentangle four encoders and (2) facilitate the prior template. Extensive
experiments on two 2D fashion benchmarks (ATR and Market-HQ) show that the
proposed method could yield high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, we
also verify the scalability of the proposed method on a fine-grained bird

find that the next-to-leading order in the EFT expansion, which comprises the
terms of the equations of motion that are quadratic in the field variables,
gives rise to a new instability in the regime of low speed of sound (high Mach
number). We rule out the possibility of a numerical artefact by considering
simplified cases in spherically and plane symmetric situations analytically. If
the speed of sound vanishes exactly, the non-linear instability makes the
evolution singular in finite time, signalling a breakdown of the EFT framework.
The case of finite (but small) speed of sound is subtle, and the local
singularity could be replaced by some other type of behaviour with strong
non-linearities. While an ultraviolet completion may cure the problem in
principle, there is no reason why this should be the case in general. As a
result, for a large range of the effective speed of sound $c_s$, a linear

have furthermore in common to be back-illuminated detectors, which allows for
ultra-thin and homogeneous photon entrance windows. This enables relatively
high quantum efficiencies at low energies and close to 100% for photon energies
between 1 keV and 10 keV. Steering of the DEPFET sensor is enabled by a
so-called Switcher ASIC and readout is performed by e.g. a VERITAS ASIC. The

results in full frame readout times of a few milliseconds for a 512 x 512 pixel

In this paper, we present the Head Swapper (HeSer), which achieves few-shot
head swapping in the wild through two delicately designed modules. Firstly, a
Head2Head Aligner is devised to holistically migrate pose and expression
information from the target to the source head by examining multi-scale
information. Secondly, to tackle the challenges of skin color variations and
head-background mismatches in the swapping procedure, a Head2Scene Blender is
introduced to simultaneously modify facial skin color and fill mismatched gaps

with the help of a Semantic-Guided Color Reference Creation procedure and a
Blending UNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
produces superior head swapping results in a variety of scenes.

representation learning methods. Yet so far, it has mostly focused on

the unsupervised context it is not clear how to guide the model to learn
representations that correspond to various potential object categories. In this
paper, we argue that self-supervised learning of object parts is a solution to
this issue. Object parts are generalizable: they are a priori independent of an
object definition, but can be grouped to form objects a posteriori. To this
end, we leverage the recently proposed Vision Transformer's capability of
attending to objects and combine it with a spatially dense clustering task for
fine-tuning the spatial tokens. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on
three semantic segmentation benchmarks by 17%-3%, showing that our

extend this to fully unsupervised segmentation - which refrains completely from

their broad applicability to graph-related problems such as quantum chemistry,
drug discovery, and high energy physics. However, meeting demand for novel GNN
models and fast inference simultaneously is challenging due to the gap between
developing efficient accelerators and the rapid creation of new GNN models.
Prior art focuses on accelerating specific classes of GNNs, such as Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCN), but lacks generality to support a wide range of
existing or new GNN models. Furthermore, most works rely on graph
pre-processing to exploit data locality, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic
dataflow architecture for GNN acceleration, named FlowGNN, which is
generalizable to the majority of message-passing GNNs. The contributions are
three-fold. First, we propose a novel and scalable dataflow architecture, which
generally supports a wide range of GNN models with message-passing mechanism.
The architecture features a configurable dataflow optimized for simultaneous
computation of node embedding, edge embedding, and message passing, which is
generally applicable to all models. We also propose a rich library of
model-specific components. Second, we deliver ultra-fast real-time GNN
inference without any graph pre-processing, making it agnostic to dynamically
changing graph structures. Third, we verify our architecture on the Xilinx
Alveo U50 FPGA board and measure the on-board end-to-end performance. We
achieve a speed-up of up to 24-254x against CPU (6226R) and 1.3-477x against

fuzzballs and microstate geometries: The reformation of black holes into

a systematic construction of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces as fine, regular, star

remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we construct Calabi-Yau orientifolds
from holomorphic reflection involutions of such hypersurfaces with Hodge
numbers $h^{1,1}\leq 12$. In particular, we compute orientifold configurations
for all favourable FRSTs for $h^{1,1}\leq 7$, while randomly sampling
triangulations for each pair of Hodge numbers up to $h^{1,1}=12$. We find
explicit string compactifications on these orientifolded Calabi-Yaus for which
the D3-charge contribution coming from O$p$-planes grows linearly with the
number of complex structure and K\""ahler moduli. We further consider non-local
D7-tadpole cancellation through Whitney branes. We argue that this leads to a
significant enhancement of the total D3-tadpole as compared to conventional
$\mathrm{SO}(8)$ stacks with $(4+4)$ D7-branes on top of O7-planes. In
particular, before turning-on worldvolume fluxes, we find that the largest
D3-tadpole in this class occurs for Calabi-Yau threefolds with
$(h^{1,1}_{+},h^{1,2}_{-})=(11,491)$ with D3-brane charges
$|Q_{\text{D3}}|=504$ for the local D7 case and $|Q_{\text{D3}}|=6,664$ for the

composition of exoplanets through material evaporated from their rocky
interiors. Among these objects are a class of disintegrating planets, observed
when their dusty tails transit in front of their host stars. These dusty tails
are thought to originate from dust condensation in thermally-driven winds
emanating from the sublimating surfaces of these planets. Existing models of
these winds have been unable to explain their highly variable nature and have
not explicitly modelled how dust forms in the wind. Here we present new
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the winds from these planets, including a
minimal model for the formation and destruction of dust, assuming that
nucleation can readily take place. We find that dust forms readily in the
winds, a consequence of large dust grains obtaining lower temperatures than the
planet's surface. As hypothesised previously, we find that the coupling of the
planet's surface temperature to the outflow properties via the dust's opacity
can drive time-variable flows when dust condensation is sufficiently fast. In
agreement with previous work, our models suggest that these dusty tails are a
signature of catastrophically evaporating planets that are close to the end of
their lives. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the dust's
composition. More detailed hydrodynamic models that self-consistently compute
the nucleation and composition of the dust and gas are warranted in order to
use these models to study the planet's interior composition.

of ""stationary"" such slices simplifies the analysis. This analysis goes beyond
standard derivations of Hawking radiation that focus on asymptotic excitations,
and in particular gives an evolving state that is regular at the horizon, with
no explicit transplanckian dependence, and that can in principle be generalized

connecting to information-theoretic investigation of black hole evolution. The
description of the evolving state depends on the choice of slices as well as
coordinates on the slices and mode bases; these choices give different

appearance in an energy eigenbasis, but such a basis is also singular at the
horizon; evolution of regular modes has a more complicated appearance, whose
properties may be inferred by comparing with the energy eigenbasis. In a
regular description, Hawking quanta are produced in a black hole atmosphere, at
scales comparable to the horizon size. This approach is also argued to extend

$\ell \in [100,500]$ and quantify the E/B power asymmetry through the $R_{EB}$
ratio, and the correlation coefficient $r^{TE}$ between T and E modes. We
quantify the dependence of $R_{EB}$ and $r^{TE}$ values on the offset angle
(between longest cloud axis and magnetic field) and inclination angle (between
line-of-sight and magnetic field) for both cloud shapes embedded either in a
regular or a turbulent magnetic field. We find that both cloud shapes cover the
same regions of the ($R_{EB}$, $r^{TE}$) parameter space. The dependence on
inclination and offset angles are similar for both shapes although sheet-like
structures generally show larger scatter. In addition to the known dependence
on the offset angle, we find a strong dependence of $R_{EB}$ and $r^{TE}$ on

with which the incoming signal interacts is initialised in a thermal state.
However, in [PRL 125:110504, 2020] the quantum capacity was found to be always
bounded away from zero for all $\lambda>0$, a phenomenon dubbed ""die-hard
quantum communication"" (D-HQCOM), provided that the initial environment state
can be chosen appropriately (depending on $\lambda$). Here we show an even
stronger version of D-HQCOM in the context of entanglement-assisted classical
communication: entanglement assistance and control of the environment enable
communication with performance at least equal to that of the ideal case of
absence of noise, even if $\lambda>0$ is arbitrarily small. These two phenomena
of D-HQCOM have technological potential provided that we are able to control
the environment. How can we achieve this? Our second main result answers this
question. Here we provide a fully consistent protocol to activate the phenomena
of D-HQCOM without directly accessing the environment state. This is done by
sending over the channel ""trigger signals"", i.e. signals which do not encode
information, prior to the actual communication, with the goal of modifying the
environment in an advantageous way. This is possible thanks to the memory
effects which arise when the sender feeds signals separated by a sufficiently
short temporal interval. Our results may offer a concrete scheme to communicate
across arbitrarily long optical fibres, without using quantum repeaters. As a
by-product of our analysis, we derive a simple Kraus representation of the
thermal attenuator exploiting the associated Lindblad master equation.

dispersion is an excellent proxy for the three-dimensional halo edge radius; 3)
we can accurately recover the full velocity dispersion profile for each of the

three distinct radial scales and two velocity dispersion amplitudes -- each of

small high-resolution crops to preserve fine segmentation details and large
low-resolution crops to capture long-range context dependencies with a learned
scale attention, while maintaining a manageable GPU memory footprint. HRDA
enables adapting small objects and preserving fine segmentation details. It

propose a novel method for determining neutrino mass ordering using the time
information on early supernova neutrino events. In a core-collapse supernova,
neutrinos are produced earlier than antineutrinos and, depending on the mass
ordering which affects the adiabatic flavor evolution, may cause earlier
observable signals in $\nu_e$ detection channels than in others. Hence, the
time differences are sensitive to the mass ordering. We find that using the
time information on the detection of the first galactic supernova events at
future detectors like DUNE, JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande, the mass ordering can
already be determined at $\sim 2 \sigma$ CL, while $\mathcal{O}(10)$ events
suffice for the discovery. Our method does not require high statistics and
could be used within the supernova early warning system (SNEWS) which will have
access to the time information on early supernova neutrino events recorded in a

  Evaluations","15 pages, 14 Figures, 10 Tables",,,,"quant-ph cs.ET","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Near-term quantum computers are noisy and have limited connectivity between
qubits. Compilers are required to introduce SWAP operations in order to perform
two-qubit gates between non-adjacent qubits. SWAPs increase the number of gates
and depth of programs, making them even more vulnerable to errors. Moreover,
they relocate qubits which affect SWAP selections for future gates in a
program. Thus, compilers must select SWAP routes that not only minimize the
overheads for the current operation, but also for future gates. Existing
compilers tend to select paths with the fewest SWAPs for the current
operations, but do not evaluate the impact of the relocations from the selected
SWAP candidate on future SWAPs. Also, they converge on SWAP candidates for the
current operation and only then decide SWAP routes for future gates, thus
severely restricting the SWAP candidate search space for future operations.
  We propose ForeSight, a compiler that simultaneously evaluates multiple SWAP
candidates for several operations into the future, delays SWAP selections to
analyze their impact on future SWAP decisions and avoids early convergence on
sub-optimal candidates. Moreover, ForeSight evaluates slightly longer SWAP
routes for current operations if they have the potential to reduce SWAPs for
future gates, thus reducing SWAPs for the program globally. As compilation
proceeds, ForeSight dynamically adds new SWAP candidates to the solution space
and eliminates the weaker ones. This allows ForeSight to reduce SWAP overheads
at program-level while keeping the compilation complexity tractable. Our
evaluations with a hundred benchmarks across three devices show that ForeSight
reduces SWAP overheads by 17% on average and 81% in the best-case, compared to
the baseline. ForeSight takes minutes, making it scalable to large programs.

an effective and popular approach for inferring the causal effect of an
intervention on a right-censored time-to-event outcome. A key challenge to
drawing such inferences in observational settings is the possible existence of
unmeasured confounding, which may invalidate most commonly used methods that
assume no hidden confounding bias. In this paper, rather than making the
standard no unmeasured confounding assumption, we extend the recently proposed
proximal causal inference framework of Miao et al. (2018), Tchetgen et al.
(2020), Cui et al. (2020) to obtain nonparametric identification of a causal
survival contrast by leveraging observed covariates as imperfect proxies of
unmeasured confounders. Specifically, we develop a proximal inverse
probability-weighted (PIPW) estimator, the proximal analog of standard IPW,
which allows the observed data distribution for the time-to-event outcome to
remain completely unrestricted. PIPW estimation relies on a parametric model
for a so-called treatment confounding bridge function relating the treatment
process to confounding proxies. As a result, PIPW might be sensitive to model
misspecification. To improve robustness and efficiency, we also propose a
proximal doubly robust estimator and establish uniform consistency and
asymptotic normality of both estimators. We conduct extensive simulations to
examine the finite sample performance of our estimators, and proposed methods
are applied to a study evaluating the effectiveness of right heart
catheterization in the intensive care unit of critically ill patients.

post-perovskite transition in MgSiO$_3$, we conduct calculations using the
phonon quasiparticle (PHQ) approach. The PHQ is based on \textit{ab initio}
molecular dynamics and, in principle, captures full anharmonicity. Free
energies in the thermodynamic limit ($N \rightarrow \infty$) are computed using
temperature-dependent quasiparticle dispersions within the phonon gas model.
Systematic results on anharmonic thermodynamic properties and phase boundary
are reported. Both the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) calculations are performed to provide confident
constraints on these properties. Anharmonic effects are demonstrated by
comparing results with those obtained using the quasiharmonic approximation
(QHA). The inadequacy of the QHA is indicated by its overestimation of thermal
expansivity and thermodynamic Gr\""{u}neisen parameter and its converged
isochoric heat capacity in the high-temperature limit. The PHQ phase boundary
has a Clapeyron slope ($dP/dT$) that increases with temperature. This result
contrasts with the nearly zero curvature of the QHA phase boundary.
Anharmonicity bends the phase boundary to lower temperatures at high pressures.
Implications for the double-crossing of the phase boundary by the mantle

good loss may significantly improve the model performance. However, manually
designing a good loss is a big challenge due to the complexity of the problem.
A large fraction of previous work focuses on handcrafted loss functions, which
needs significant expertise and human effort. In this paper, inspired by the
recent development of automated machine learning, we propose an automatic loss
function generation framework, AutoLossGen, which is able to generate loss
functions directly constructed from basic mathematical operators without prior
knowledge on loss structure. More specifically, we develop a controller model
driven by reinforcement learning to generate loss functions, and develop
iterative and alternating optimization schedule to update the parameters of
both the controller model and the recommender model. One challenge for
automatic loss generation in recommender systems is the extreme sparsity of
recommendation datasets, which leads to the sparse reward problem for loss
generation and search. To solve the problem, we further develop a reward
filtering mechanism for efficient and effective loss generation. Experimental
results show that our framework manages to create tailored loss functions for
different recommendation models and datasets, and the generated loss gives
better recommendation performance than commonly used baseline losses. Besides,
most of the generated losses are transferable, i.e., the loss generated based
on one model and dataset also works well for another model or dataset. Source

a novel hand-held robot for in-office laser surgery of the vocal folds.
In-office endoscopic laser surgery is an emerging trend in Laryngology: It
promises to deliver the same patient outcomes of traditional surgical treatment
(i.e., in the operating room), at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, office
procedures can be challenging to perform; the optical fibers used for laser
delivery can only emit light forward in a line-of-sight fashion, which severely
limits anatomical access. The robot we present in this letter aims to overcome
these challenges. The end effector of the robot is a steerable laser fiber,
created through the combination of a thin optical fiber (0.225 mm) with a
tendon-actuated Nickel-Titanium notched sheath that provides bending. This
device can be seamlessly used with most commercially available endoscopes, as
it is sufficiently small (1.1 mm) to pass through a working channel. To control
the fiber, we propose a compact actuation unit that can be mounted on top of
the endoscope handle, so that, during a procedure, the operating physician can
operate both the endoscope and the steerable fiber with a single hand. We
report simulation and phantom experiments demonstrating that the proposed
device substantially enhances surgical access compared to current clinical
fibers.

expensive function evaluations. Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (BO) can
be used to alleviate the computation time to find an approximated set of Pareto
optimal solutions. In many real-world problems, a decision-maker has some
preferences on the objective functions. One approach to incorporate the
preferences in multi-objective BO is to use a scalarising function and build a
single surrogate model (mono-surrogate approach) on it. This approach has two
major limitations. Firstly, the fitness landscape of the scalarising function
and the objective functions may not be similar. Secondly, the approach assumes
that the scalarising function distribution is Gaussian, and thus a closed-form
expression of an acquisition function e.g., expected improvement can be used.
We overcome these limitations by building independent surrogate models
(multi-surrogate approach) on each objective function and show that the
distribution of the scalarising function is not Gaussian. We approximate the
distribution using Generalised value distribution. We present an a-priori
multi-surrogate approach to incorporate the desirable objective function values

which can be attributed to pulsar's motion. By comparing archival and new CXO
observations, we measure the pulsar's proper motion $\mu=28.8\pm7.3$ mas/yr,
yielding a projected pulsar velocity $v \approx 440\pm110$ km/s (at d=3.2 kpc);
its direction is consistent with the PWN shape. Radio emission from the PWN is
polarized, with the magnetic field oriented along the pulsar tail. The radio
tail connects to a larger radio structure (not seen in X-rays) which we
interpret as a relic PWN (also known as a plerion). The spectral analysis of
the CXO data shows that the PWN spectrum softens from $\Gamma=1.7$ to
$\Gamma\approx2.3-2.5$ with increasing distance from the pulsar. The softening
can be attributed to rapid synchrotron burn-off, which would explain the lack
of X-ray emission from the older relic PWN. In addition to non-thermal PWN
emission, we detected thermal emission from a hot plasma which we attribute to
the host SNR. The radio PWN morphology and the proper motion of the pulsar
suggest that the reverse shock passed through the pulsar's vicinity and pushed
the PWN to one side.

for significant property damage and loss of life. Accurate, efficient models of
storm surge are needed both to assess long-term risk and to guide emergency
management decisions. While high-fidelity regional- and global-ocean
circulation models such as the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model can
accurately predict storm surge, they are very computationally expensive. Here
we develop a novel surrogate model for peak storm surge prediction based on a
multi-stage approach. In the first stage, points are classified as inundated or
not. In the second, the level of inundation is predicted . Additionally, we
propose a new formulation of the surrogate problem in which storm surge is
predicted independently for each point. This allows for predictions to be made
directly for locations not present in the training data, and significantly
reduces the number of model parameters. We demonstrate our modeling framework
on two study areas: the Texas coast and the northern portion of the Alaskan
coast. For Texas, the model is trained with a database of 446 synthetic
hurricanes. The model is able to accurately match ADCIRC predictions on a test
set of synthetic storms. We further present a test of the model on Hurricanes
Ike (2008) and Harvey (2017). For Alaska, the model is trained on a dataset of
109 historical surge events. We test the surrogate model on actual surge events
including the recent Typhoon Merbok (2022) that take place after the events in
the training data. For both datasets, the surrogate model achieves similar
performance to ADCIRC on real events when compared to observational data. In
both cases, the surrogate models are many orders of magnitude faster than
ADCIRC.

clients has been empirically shown to be a successful approach to overcoming
the communication bottleneck in Federated Learning (FL). Such methods are
usually implemented by having clients perform one or more epochs of local
training per round while randomly reshuffling their finite dataset in each
epoch. Data imbalance, where clients have different numbers of local training
samples, is ubiquitous in FL applications, resulting in different clients
performing different numbers of local updates in each round. In this work, we
propose a general recipe, FedShuffle, that better utilizes the local updates in
FL, especially in this regime encompassing random reshuffling and
heterogeneity. FedShuffle is the first local update method with theoretical
convergence guarantees that incorporates random reshuffling, data imbalance,
and client sampling - features that are essential in large-scale cross-device
FL. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of FedShuffle and show,
both theoretically and empirically, that it does not suffer from the objective
function mismatch that is present in FL methods that assume homogeneous updates
in heterogeneous FL setups, such as FedAvg (McMahan et al., 2017). In addition,
by combining the ingredients above, FedShuffle improves upon FedNova (Wang et
al., 2020), which was previously proposed to solve this mismatch. Similar to
Mime (Karimireddy et al., 2020), we show that FedShuffle with momentum variance
reduction (Cutkosky & Orabona, 2019) improves upon non-local methods under a
Hessian similarity assumption.

train a model without sharing their data. Models are optimized locally at each
client and further communicated to a central hub for aggregation. While FL is
an appealing decentralized training paradigm, heterogeneity among data from
different clients can cause the local optimization to drift away from the
global objective. In order to estimate and therefore remove this drift,
variance reduction techniques have been incorporated into FL optimization
recently. However, these approaches inaccurately estimate the clients' drift
and ultimately fail to remove it properly. In this work, we propose an adaptive
algorithm that accurately estimates drift across clients. In comparison to
previous works, our approach necessitates less storage and communication
bandwidth, as well as lower compute costs. Additionally, our proposed
methodology induces stability by constraining the norm of estimates for client
drift, making it more practical for large scale FL. Experimental findings
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges significantly faster and
achieves higher accuracy than the baselines across various FL benchmarks.

free. The couplings of the dilaton and the ""universal"" modulus to all fields of
the observable and hidden sectors are presented and analyzed. These

protect quantum information as it is transformed by logical gates. Given a CSS
code $\mathcal{C}$, we derive conditions that are both necessary and sufficient
for a transversal diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ to preserve $\mathcal{C}$
and induce $U_L$. The group of $Z$-stabilizers in a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$ is
determined by the dual of a classical $[n, k_1]$ binary code $\mathcal{C}_1$,
and the group of $X$-stabilizers is determined by a classical $[n, k_2]$ binary
code $\mathcal{C}_2$ that is contained in $\mathcal{C}_1$. The requirement that
a diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ fixes a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$ leads to
constraints on the congruence of weights in cosets of $\mathcal{C}_2$. These
constraints are a perfect fit to divisible codes, and represent an opportunity
to take advantage of the extensive literature on classical codes with two or
three weights. We construct new families of CSS codes using cosets of the first
order Reed Muller code defined by quadratic forms. We provide a simple
alternative to the standard method of deriving the coset weight distributions
(based on Dickson normal form) that may be of independent interest. Finally, we
develop an approach to circumventing the Eastin-Knill Theorem which states that
no QECC can implement a universal set of logical gates through transversal

analyzed in this paper. The satellites in these FSOSNs will have limited energy
and thereby limited power, and we investigate the effect of link distance and
link margin on optical inter-satellite link transmission power, and the effect
of slant distance, elevation angle, and link margin on optical uplink/downlink
transmission power. We model these optical links and compute the results for
various parameters. We observe that the transmission power increases when the
link distance increases for inter-satellite and uplink/downlink communications,
while the transmission power decreases when the elevation angle increases for
uplink/downlink transmission. We also observe an inverse relationship between
link margin and link distance. Furthermore, we highlight some practical
insights and design guidelines gained from this analysis.

threads visible in the AIA 304 {\AA} passband and in the core of Mg II
resonance lines have dark ($T_{\rm b}<5000$K) counterparts in the 1.25 mm maps,
but their visibility significantly varies across the filament spine and in
time. These opacity changes are possibly related to variations in temperature
and electron density in filament fine structures. The coolest $T_{\rm b}$
values ($<$5000 K) coincide with regions of low integrated intensity in the Mg
II h and k lines. ALMA Band 3 maps taken after the Band 6 ones do not clearly
show the filament structure, contrary to the expectation that the contrast
should increase at longer wavelengths based on previous observations of
quiescent filaments. The ALMA maps are not consistent with isothermal
conditions, but the temporal evolution of the filament may partly account for
this.

nonautonomous dynamical systems in multiscale media using Koopman operators.
Different from the case of autonomous dynamical systems, the Koopman operator
family of nonautonomous dynamical systems significantly depend on a time pair.
In order to effectively estimate the time-dependent Koopman operators, a moving
time window is used to decompose the snapshot data, and the extended dynamic
mode decomposition method is applied to computing the Koopman operators in each
local temporal domain. Many physical properties in multiscale media often vary
in very different scales. In order to capture multiscale information well, the
dimension of collected data may be high. To accurately construct the models of
dynamical systems in multiscale media, we use high spatial dimension of
observation data. It is challenging to compute the Koopman operators using the
very high dimensional data. Thus, the strategy of reduced-order modeling is
proposed to treat the difficulty. The proposed reduced-order modeling includes
two stages: offline stage and online stage. In offline stage, a block-wise low
rank decomposition is used to reduce the spatial dimension of initial snapshot
data. For the nonautonomous dynamical systems, real-time observation data may
be required to update the Koopman operators. The online reduced-order modeling
is proposed to correct the offline reduced-order modeling. Three methods are
developed for the online reduced-order modeling: fully online, semi-online and
adaptive online. The adaptive online method automatically selects the fully
online or semi-online and can achieve a good trade-off between modeling
accuracy and efficiency.

ISO26262 recommends fault injection as the proper technique to verify and

complexity, a lot of effort and stringent verification flow is needed.
Moreover, many fault injection tools offer only a limited degree of
controllability.
  We propose MetaFI, a model-driven simulator-independent fault simulation
framework that provides multi-purpose fault injection strategies such as
Statistical Fault Injection, Direct Fault Injection, Exhaustive Fault
Injection, and at the same time reduces manual efforts. The framework enables
injection of Stuck-at faults, Single-Event Transient faults, Single-Event Upset
faults as well as Timing faults. The fault simulation is performed at the
Register Transfer Level (RTL) of a design, in which parts of the design
targeted for fault simulation are represented with Gate-level (GL) granularity.
MetaFI is scalable with a full System-on-Chip (SoC) design and to demonstrate
the applicability of the framework, fault simulation was applied to various
components of two different SoCs. One SoC is running the Dhrystone application
and the other one is running a Fingerprint calculation application. A minimal
effort of 2 persondays was required to run 38 various fault injection campaigns

reached an unprecedented level of complexity, scale and heterogeneity, becoming
the core of several modern applications such as smart industry, smart buildings

stack, namely the sets of rules and data formats that determine how the nodes
in the network exchange information. A great effort has been put to devise
formal techniques to synthesize (offline) network protocols, starting from
system specifications and strict assumptions on the network environment.
However, offline design can be hard to apply in the most modern network
applications, either due to numerical complexity, or to the fact that the
environment might be unknown and the specifications might not available. In
these cases, online protocol design and adaptation has the potential to offer a
much more scalable and robust solution. Nevertheless, so far only a few
attempts have been done towards online automatic protocol design. Here, we
envision a protocol as an emergent property of a network, obtained by an

reinforcement signals to evolve, at runtime and without any central
coordination, a network protocol from scratch. We test this approach with a
3-state Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Medium Access Control (MAC)

approach that is applicable to meshes that consist of arbitrarily-shaped
polygonal and polyhedral (simple and nonsimple) elements. In the VEM, the basis
functions are defined as the solution of a local elliptic partial differential
equation, and are never explicitly computed in the implementation of the
method. The stifness matrix of each element is built by using the elliptic
projection operator of the internal virtual work (bilinear form) and it
consists of two terms: a consistency term that is exactly computed (linear
patch test is satisfied) and a correction term (ensures stability) that is
orthogonal to affine displacement fields and has the right scaling. The VEM
simplifies mesh generation for a multiphase composite: a stiff inclusion can be
modeled using a single polygonal or polyhedral element. Attributes of the
virtual element approach are highlighted through comparisons with Voronoi-cell
lattice models, which provide discrete representations of material structure.
The comparisons involve a suite of two-dimensional linear elastic problems:
patch test, axisymmetric circular inclusion problem, and the deformation of a
three-phase composite. The simulations demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility
of the virtual element method.

delays and failures caused by the system's heterogeneity and uncertainties. In
particular, minimizing the end-to-end job in-order execution delay, from
arrival to delivery, is of great importance for real-world delay-sensitive
applications. In this paper, for computation of each job iteration in a
stochastic heterogeneous distributed system where the workers vary in their
computing and communicating powers, we present a novel joint scheduling-coding
framework that optimally split the coded computational load among the workers.
This closes the gap between the workers' response time, and is critical to
maximize the resource utilization. To further reduce the in-order execution
delay, we also incorporate redundant computations in each iteration of a

delay obtained using the proposed solution is dramatically lower than the
uniform split which is oblivious to the system's heterogeneity and, in fact, is
very close to an ideal lower bound just by introducing a small percentage of
redundant computations.

performance assessment and evaluation of the impact of interference is of
interest for industry and academia. In this paper, we present contributions on
those topics. First, we evaluate the performance of mIAB compared to fiber
connected deployments. Moreover, we study the impact of interference on the
performance of mIAB networks and propose a solution based on inserting silent
slots on the time division duplex (TDD) frame pattern. According to our
simulation results, mIAB is capable of improving performance of onboard user
equipments (UEs) without harming too much the quality of service (QoS) of
surrounding UEs. Furthermore, we show that the TDD frame pattern should be
carefully designed to account for scenarios with different levels of
interference.

Phase-based analysis involves perturbation analysis about a periodically
varying base state and hence is tailored for the analysis of periodic flows. We
formulate the phase description of periodic flows with respect to the potential
and vortical perturbations in the flow field. The current phase-reduction
analysis can also be implemented consistently in the immersed boundary
projection method, which facilitates the analysis over arbitrarily-shaped
bodies. We demonstrate the strength of the phase-based analysis for periodic

The critical regions for phase modification in the cylinder flow are
investigated and the locations of flow separation are shown to be the most
sensitive regions. Further, the results reveal the influence of the angle of
attack and airfoil thickness on the phase-sensitivity distribution of flows
over various airfoils. The phase for such flows is defined based on the lift
coefficient, and hence is influenced by the vortical structures responsible for
lift production. The present framework sheds light on the connection between
phase-sensitivity and vortex formation dynamics.

a homogenous Finsler submersion, i.e., we study, what in Riemannian geometry
was called by Wilking, the dual leaves. More precisely, we investigate the
attainable sets $\mathcal{A}_{q}(\mathcal{C})$ of the set of analytic vector
fields $\mathcal{C}$ determined by the family of horizontal unit geodesic
vector fields $\mathcal{C}$ to the fibers $\mathcal{F}=\{\rho^{-1}(c)\}$ of a
homogenous analytic Finsler submersion $\rho: M\to B$. Since reverse of
geodesics don't need to be geodesics in Finsler geometry, one can have examples
on non compact Finsler manifolds $M$ where the attainable sets (the dual
leaves) are no longer orbits or even submanifolds. Nevertheless we prove that,
when $M$ is compact and the orbits of $\mathcal{C}$ are embedded, then the
attainable sets coincide with the orbits. Furthermore, if the flag curvature is
positive then $M$ coincides with the attainable set of each point. In other
words, fixed two points of $M$, one can travel from one point to the other
along horizontal broken geodesics.
  In addition, we show that each orbit $\mathcal{O}(q)$ of $\mathcal{C}$
associated to a singular Finsler foliation coincides with $M$, when the flag
curvature is positive, i.e, we prove Wilking's result in Finsler context. In
particular we review Wilking's transversal Jacobi fields in Finsler case.

contamination or crossover) occurs when a patient initially assigned to one
treatment arm changes to another arm during the course of follow-up.
Overlooking treatment switching might substantially bias the evaluation of
treatment efficacy or safety. To account for treatment switching, instrumental
variable (IV) methods by leveraging the initial randomized assignment as an IV
serve as natural adjustment methods because they allow dependent treatment
switching possibly due to underlying prognoses. However, the ``exclusion
restriction'' assumption for IV methods, which requires the initial
randomization to have no direct effect on the outcome, remains questionable,
especially for open-label trials. We propose a robust instrumental variable
estimator circumventing such a caveat. We derive large-sample properties of our
proposed estimator, along with inferential tools. We conduct extensive
simulations to examine the finite performance of our estimator and its
associated inferential tools. An R package ``ivsacim'' implementing all
proposed methods is freely available on R CRAN. We apply the estimator to
evaluate the treatment effect of Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
(NRTIs) on a safety outcome in the Optimized Treatment That Includes or Omits
NRTIs trial.

the curvature singularity the modified metric describes a space which is
exponentially expanding in one direction and oscillating the other two

introducing an intuitive and simple relation-specific translation, TranSHER can

slit or image slicer located in the intermediate focal plane. In such a
spectrograph, it is not trivial to distinguish aberrations in the first stage,
before the slit, from those in the second, after the slit. However, our method
achieves this. Measuring these aberrations separately opens the possibility of
reducing them, by realignment or other means, and thereby improving the optical
performance of the instrument. The method is based on fitting models to
multiple images of a point source, with controlled displacements of the source
perpendicular to the slit and controlled defocuses of the second stage or the
detector. Fitting models to these images allows the determination of the
aberrations in both stages. Our key discovery is that the displaced and
defocused images provide additional information which allows us to break the
ambiguity between the two stages. We present simulations that validate the
performance of the method.

Moreover, we also consider a variant, namely continuous top-k community
similarity search (CTop-kCS2), where the query community continuously moves
along a query line segment. We develop an efficient algorithm to split query
line segments into intervals, incrementally obtain similar candidate
communities for each interval and define actual CTop-kCS2 query answers.

environments (Omnidata), and (2) online finetuning of visuomotor
representations on specific tasks with image augmentations under long learning
schedules. We call this method Offline Visual Representation Learning (OVRL).
We conduct large-scale experiments - on 3 different 3D datasets (Gibson, HM3D,
MP3D), 2 tasks (ImageNav, ObjectNav), and 2 policy learning algorithms (RL, IL)
- and find that the OVRL representations lead to significant across-the-board

generalizing to datasets that were not seen during pretraining. While the
benefits of pretraining sometimes diminish (or entirely disappear) with long

the galaxy environments of a sample of 36 HI-selected partial Lyman limit
systems (pLLSs) and Lyman limit systems (LLSs) in 23 QSO fields at $z \lesssim
1$. These pLLSs/LLSs provide a unique sample of absorbers with unbiased and
well-constrained metallicities, allowing us to explore the origins of
metal-rich and low-metallicity circumgalactic medium (CGM) at $z<1$. Here we
present Keck/KCWI and VLT/MUSE observations of 11 of these QSO fields (19
pLLSs) that we combine with HST/ACS imaging to identify and characterize the
absorber-associated galaxies. We find 23 unique absorber-associated galaxies,
with an average of one associated galaxy per absorber. For seven absorbers, all
with $<10\%$ solar metallicities, we find no associated galaxies with $\log
M_\star \gtrsim 9.0$ within $\rho/R_{vir}$ and $|\Delta v|/v_{esc} \le$ 1.5
with respect to the absorber. We do not find any strong correlations between
the metallicities or HI column densities of the gas and most of the galaxy
properties, except for the stellar mass of the galaxies: the low-metallicity
([X/H] $\le -1.4$) systems have a probability of $0.39^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for
having a host galaxy with $\log M_\star \ge 9.0$ within $\rho/R_{vir} \le 1.5$,
while the higher metallicity absorbers have a probability of
$0.78^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$. This implies metal-enriched pLLSs/LLSs at $z<1$ are
typically associated with the CGM of galaxies with $\log M_\star > 9.0$,
whereas low-metallicity pLLSs/LLSs are found in more diverse locations, with
one population arising in the CGM of galaxies and another more broadly
distributed in overdense regions of the universe. Using absorbers not
associated with galaxies, we estimate the unweighted geometric mean metallicity
of the intergalactic medium to be [X/H] $\lesssim -2.1$ at $z<1$, which is
lower than previously estimated.

reactor concepts seek solid fuels that must withstand unprecedented temperature

safety. The science of thermal transport in nuclear fuel is a grand challenge
due to both computational and experimental complexities. Here, we provide a
comprehensive review of thermal transport research on two actinide oxides: one
currently in use in commercial nuclear reactors, uranium dioxide (UO2), and one
advanced fuel candidate material, thorium dioxide (ThO2). In both materials,
heat is carried by lattice waves or phonons. Crystalline defects caused by
fission events effectively scatter phonons and lead to a degradation in fuel
performance over time. Bolstered by new computational and experimental tools,
researchers are now developing the foundational work necessary to accurately
model and ultimately control thermal transport in advanced nuclear fuel. We
begin by reviewing research aimed at understanding thermal transport in perfect
single crystals. The absence of defects enables studies that focus on the
fundamental aspects of phonon transport. Next, we review research that targets
defect generation and evolution. Here, the focus is on ion irradiation studies
used as surrogates for damage caused by fission products. We end this review
with a discussion of modeling and experimental efforts directed at predicting

most galaxies with bulges, few SMBHs have been confirmed in bulgeless galaxies.
Identifying such a population could provide important insights to the BH seed
population and secular BH growth. To this end, we obtained near-infrared
spectroscopic observations of a sample of low-redshift bulgeless galaxies with
mid-infrared colors suggestive of AGN. We find additional evidence of AGN
activity (such as coronal lines and broad permitted lines) in 69$\%$ (9/13) of
the sample, demonstrating that mid-infrared selection is a powerful tool to
detect AGN. More than half of the galaxies with confirmed AGN activity show
fast outflows in [O III] in the optical and/or [Si VI] in the NIR, with the
latter generally having much faster velocities that are also correlated to
their spatial extent. We are also able to obtain virial BH masses for some
targets and find they fall within the scatter of other late-type galaxies in
the $M_{\rm{BH}}$-$M_{\rm{stellar}}$ relation. The fact that they lack a
significant bulge component indicates that secular processes, likely
independent of major mergers, grew these BHs to supermassive sizes. Finally, we
analyze the rotational gas kinematics and find two notable exceptions: two AGN
hosts with outflows that appear to be rotating faster than expected. There is
an indication that these two galaxies have stellar masses significantly lower
than expected from their dark matter halo masses. This, combined with the
observed AGN activity and strong gas outflows may be evidence of the effects of
AGN feedback.

the problem of the decrease of the neutron flux as it penetrates into a

steady-state neutron transport, starting from Stuart's formula. Simple formulae
were derived based on the integral cross-section parameters that could be
adopted by the user according to various variables, such as the neutron flux
distribution and geometry of the simulation at hand. The concluded formulae of
the self-shielding factors comprise an inverted sigmoid function normalized
with a weight representing the ratio between the macroscopic total and
scattering cross-sections of the medium. The general convex volume geometries
are reduced to a set of chord lengths, while the neutron interactions
probabilities within the volume are parameterized to the epithermal and thermal
neutron energies. The arguments of the inverted-sigmoid function were derived
from a simplified version of neutron transport formulation. Accordingly, the
obtained general formulae were successful in giving the values of the
experimental neutron self-shielding factor for different elements and different
geometries.

picture of reducing the number density of neutrons, the perturbation was found
to influence the moderation of neutrons in the medium, significantly above 1

numerical computing of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, in most
cases, Green's function is difficult to compute. The troubles arise in the
following three folds. Firstly, compared with the original PDE, the dimension
of Green's function is doubled, making it impossible to be handled by
traditional mesh-based methods. Secondly, Green's function usually contains
singularities which increase the difficulty to get a good approximation.
Lastly, the computational domain may be very complex or even unbounded. To
override these problems, we leverage the fundamental solution, boundary
integral method and neural networks to develop a new method for computing
Green's function with high accuracy in this paper. We focus on Green's function
of Poisson and Helmholtz equations in bounded domains, unbounded domains. We
also consider Poisson equation and Helmholtz domains with interfaces. Extensive
numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and the accuracy of our method
for solving Green's function. In addition, we also use the Green's function
calculated by our method to solve a class of PDE, and also obtain
high-precision solutions, which shows the good generalization ability of our
method on solving PDEs.

the server irrationally chooses malicious clients for aggregation even after
they have been detected in previous rounds; the defenses perform ineffectively
against sybil attacks or in the heterogeneous data setting.
  To overcome these issues, we propose MAB-RFL, a new method for robust
aggregation in FL. By modelling the client selection as an extended multi-armed
bandit (MAB) problem, we propose an adaptive client selection strategy to
choose honest clients that are more likely to contribute high-quality updates.
We then propose two approaches to identify malicious updates from sybil and
non-sybil attacks, based on which rewards for each client selection decision
can be accurately evaluated to discourage malicious behaviors. MAB-RFL achieves
a satisfying balance between exploration and exploitation on the potential
benign clients. Extensive experimental results show that MAB-RFL outperforms

features in the test environment (target domain) differs from that of the

adaptation (TTA), where a model adapts to the target domain without access to
the source dataset, can be used in the test environment. However, the existing
TTA methods lack feature distribution alignment between the source and target
domains, which unsupervised domain adaptation mainly addresses, because
accessing the source dataset is prohibited in the TTA setting. In this paper,
we propose a novel TTA method, named Covariance-Aware Feature alignment (CAFe),
which explicitly aligns the source and target feature distributions at test

auxiliary feature statistics (mean and covariance) pre-computed on the source
domain, which are lightweight and easily prepared. Further, to improve
efficiency and stability, we propose feature grouping, which splits the feature
dimensions into groups according to their correlations by using spectral
clustering to avoid degeneration of the covariance matrix. We empirically show
that CAFe outperforms prior TTA methods on a variety of distribution shifts.

the GRT lightcurve depends on $M_{\rm ej}$ and $v_{\rm ej}$ as $t_{\rm pk}
\approx 0.5~{\rm days} ~ (M_{\rm ej}/0.01M_{\odot})^{1/2}(v_{\rm

(M_{\rm ej}/0.01M_{\odot})^{1/2}(v_{\rm ej}/0.1c)$. Most radiating photons are
in the $100-3000$ keV band and the spectrum peaks at about 800~keV for
different nuclear physics inputs. The line features are blurred out by the
Doppler broadening effect. Adopting the ejecta parameters reported in
literature, we examine the detection probability of the possible GRT associated
with AT2017gfo. We show that the GRT cannot be convincingly detected neither
with current nor with the proposed missions in the MeV band, such as ETCC and
AMEGO. The low gamma-ray flux, together with the extremely low event rate at
local universe, makes a discovery of GRTs a great challenge.

network, has attracted the interest of researchers. While the training of
spiking neural networks is still an open problem. One effective way is to map
the weight of trained ANN to SNN to achieve high reasoning ability. However,
the converted spiking neural network often suffers from performance degradation
and a considerable time delay. To speed up the inference process and obtain
higher accuracy, we theoretically analyze the errors in the conversion process
from three perspectives: the differences between IF and ReLU, time dimension,
and pooling operation. We propose a neuron model for releasing burst spikes, a
cheap but highly efficient method to solve residual information. In addition,
Lateral Inhibition Pooling (LIPooling) is proposed to solve the inaccuracy
problem caused by MaxPooling in the conversion process. Experimental results on
CIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and accurate.
For example, our method can ensure nearly lossless conversion of SNN and only
use about 1/10 (less than 100) simulation time under 0.693$\times$ energy

use these results to explore future prospects at the HL-LHC. Our results can be
directly applied to any kind of new physics scenarios sharing the final states
and the event topology. For concreteness, we apply our results to a benchmark

Remarkably, even with current data the sensitivity of our analysis shows a
reach for masses of a heavy neutral Higgs and vectorlike leptons up to 2 TeV

electrons in a corona plays a fundamental role in shaping the X-ray spectra of
black-hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), particularly in the hard and
hard-intermediate states. In these states, the power-density spectra of these
sources typically show Type-C low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
Although several models have been proposed to explain the dynamical origin of
their frequency, only a few of those models predict the spectral-timing
radiative properties of the QPOs. Here we study the physical and geometrical
properties of the corona of the BH-LMXB GRS 1915+105 based on a large sample of
observations available in the RXTE archive. We use a recently-developed
spectral-timing Comptonisation model to fit simultaneously the energy-dependent
fractional rms amplitude and phase-lag spectra of the Type-C QPO in 398
observations. For this, we include spectral information gathered from fitting a
Comptonisation model to the corresponding time-averaged spectra. We analyse the
dependence of the physical and geometrical properties of the corona upon the
QPO frequency and spectral state of the source, the latter characterised by the
hardness ratio. We find consistent trends in the evolution of the corona size,
temperature, and feedback (the fraction of the corona photons that impinge back
onto the disc) that persist for roughly 15~years. By correlating our
observations with simultaneous radio-monitoring of the source at 15 GHz, we
propose a scenario in which the disc-corona interactions connect with the
launching mechanism of the radio jet in this source.

studies have successfully used domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) to address
this issue. In DAPT, models are initialized with the generic dataset
pre-trained weights, and further pre-training is performed using a moderately
sized in-domain dataset (medical images). Although this technique achieved good
results for the downstream tasks in terms of accuracy and robustness, it is
computationally expensive even when the datasets for DAPT are moderately sized.
These compute-intensive techniques and models impact the environment negatively
and create an uneven playing field for researchers with limited resources. This
study proposed computationally efficient DAPT without compromising the
downstream accuracy and robustness. This study proposes three techniques for
this purpose, where the first (partial DAPT) performs DAPT on a subset of
layers. The second one adopts a hybrid strategy (hybrid DAPT) by performing
partial DAPT for a few epochs and then full DAPT for the remaining epochs. The
third technique performs DAPT on simplified variants of the base architecture.
The results showed that compared to the standard DAPT (full DAPT), the hybrid
DAPT technique achieved better performance on the development and external

music vocoding model for mapping synthetically generated mel-spectrograms to
perceptually realistic waveforms. We find that this approach to music
enhancement outperforms baselines which use classical methods for
mel-spectrogram inversion and an end-to-end approach directly mapping noisy

confused about when and which pattern to adopt. In this paper, we present a set
of decision models for the selection of patterns for federated machine learning
architecture design based on a systematic literature review on federated
machine learning, to assist designers and architects who have limited knowledge
of federated machine learning. Each decision model maps functional and
non-functional requirements of federated machine learning systems to a set of

decision models by mapping the decision patterns to concrete federated machine
learning architectures by big tech firms to assess the models' correctness and

are able to bring structure to the federated machine learning architecture
design process and help explicitly articulate the design rationale.

the first thorough experiment for model selection and adaptation for transfer

computer vision on 667 wind and photovoltaic parks. To the best of our

classical optimization approaches for the development of coarse-grained model
parameters; namely bottom-up and top-down approaches. This is achieved through
integrating the optimization algorithms into a machine learning (ML) model,
trained using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. In the bottom-up
approach, bonded interactions of the CG model are optimized using deep neural
networks (DNN), where atomistic bonded distributions are matched. The atomistic
distributions emulate the local chain structure. In the top-down approach,
optimization of nonbonded potentials is accomplished by reproducing the
temperature-dependent experimental density. We demonstrate that CG model
parameters achieved through our machine-learning enabled hybrid optimization

associated with the classical approaches to coarse-graining model polymers. We
demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and transferability of the developed CG

field of RCW 120 is along the direction of $20^\circ$, parallel to the Galactic
plane. The field strength on the plane of the sky is $100\pm26\,\mu$G. The
magnetic field around the eastern shell shows evidence of compression by the
HII region. The external pressure (turbulent pressure + magnetic pressure) and
the gas density of the ambient cloud are minimum along the direction where RCW
120 breaks out, which explains the observed elongation of RCW 120. The

$\sim\,1.6\,\mathrm{Myr}$ for field strength of $100\,\mu$G, older than the

field. The strong magnetic field in general reduces the efficiency of triggered

observational signatures of cosmic string wakes as these signatures depend upon
the temperature fluctuations generated by the shock. We also find that as the
shock moves away, the residual magnetic field left behind reconnects and
dissipates rapidly. The magnetic field around the string is thus very

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) have been a promising direction in achieving
performance and productivity, but the current state of the art only supports
stencil computation, leaving solvers requiring loop-carried dependencies aside.
Alternatively, sparse matrices can represent such equation solvers and are more
general than existing DSLs, but the performance is sacrificed.
  This paper points out that sparse matrices can be represented as programs
instead of data, having both the generality from the matrix-based
representation and the performance from program optimizations. Based on the
idea, we propose the Staged Sparse Row (SSR) sparse matrix representation that
can efficiently cover applications on structured grids. With SSR
representation, users can intuitively define SSR matrices using generator
functions and use SSR matrices through a concise object-oriented interface. SSR
matrices can then be chained and applied to construct the algorithm, including
those with loop-carried dependences. We then apply a set of dedicated
optimizations, and ultimately simplify the SSR matrix-based codes into
straightforward matrix-free ones, which are efficient and friendly for further
analysis.
  Implementing BT pseudo application in the NAS Parallel Benchmark, with less
than $10\%$ lines of code compared with the matrix-free reference FORTRAN
implementation, we achieved up to $92.8\%$ performance. Implementing a
matrix-free variant for the High-Performance Conjugate Gradient benchmark, we

Inspired by this, we propose friendly adversarial data augmentation (FADA) to
generate friendly adversarial data. On top of FADA, we propose geometry-aware
adversarial training (GAT) to perform adversarial training on friendly
adversarial data so that we can save a large number of search steps.
Comprehensive experiments across two widely used datasets and three pre-trained

star. Moreover, a striking number of young circumstellar disks have gas and/or
dust gaps at large orbital separations, potentially driven by embedded
planetary objects. To form massive planets at large orbital separations through
core accretion within disk lifetime, however, an early solid body to seed
pebble and gas accretion is desirable. Young protoplanetary disks are likely
self-gravitating, and these gravitoturbulent disks may efficiently concentrate
solid material at the midplane driven by spiral waves. We run 3D local
hydrodynamical simulations of gravitoturbulent disks with Lagrangian dust
particles to determine whether particle and gas self-gravity can lead to the
formation of dense solid bodies, seeding later planet formation. When
self-gravity between dust particles is included, solids of size $\mathrm{St} =
0.1$ to $1$ concentrate within the gravitoturbulent spiral features and
collapse under their own self-gravity into dense clumps up to several
$M_{\oplus}$ in mass at wide orbits. Simulations with dust that drift most
efficiently, $\mathrm{St}=1$, form the most massive clouds of particles, while
simulations with smaller dust particles, $\mathrm{St}=0.1$, have clumps with
masses an order of magnitude lower. When the effect of dust backreaction onto
the gas is included, dust clumps become smaller by a factor of a few but more
numerous. The existence of large solid bodies at an early stage of the disk can
accelerate the planet formation process, particularly at wide orbital
separations, and potentially explain planets distant from the central stars and
young protoplanetary disks with substructures.

for manipulating spin at the limits of single or few atomic layers, and for
creating unique magneto-exciton devices through the coupling of long-range
ferromagnetic (FM) orders and excitons. However, 2D vdW ferromagnets explored
so far have rarely possessed exciton behaviors; to date, FM CrI3 have been
recently revealed to show ligand-field photoluminescence correlated with FM
ordering, but typically with a broad emission peak. Alternatively, many-body
excitons have been observed in antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiPS3, but the coupling
of excitons with AFM orders is exponentially more difficult, owing to extremely
high coercivity. Here, we report a straightforward approach to realize strong
coupling of narrow helical emission and FM orders at a low magnetic field in
CrI3 through a relatively simple microsphere cavity. We show that the resonant
whispering-gallery-modes (WGM) of SiO2 microspheres give rising to a series of
strong oscillation helical emissions with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
of ~5 nm under continuous wave excitation. Reversible magnetic control and
coding of helical luminescence with multiwavelength is realized in the range of
950-1100 nm. This work enables plenty of opportunities for creating magnetic

intermediate objectives do not always align with overall system performance.
For example, optimizing the likelihood of a trajectory prediction module might
focus more on easy-to-predict agents than safety-critical or rare behaviors

objectives (CAPOs), to evaluate the downstream effect of predictions on control

differ significantly from different viewpoints. Previous methods mainly use
manually annotated multi-attribute datasets to assist the network in getting

features, which can distinguish similar vehicles. And the OVG model can
generate multi-view features based on the input view features to reduce the
impact of viewpoint mismatches. Finally, the distance between vehicle
appearances is presented by the discriminative region features and multi-view
features together. Therefore, the significance of pairwise distance measure

time, for deployment in a hospital, the diagnosis must be explainable and
transparent. In this paper, we present an approach using diagnosis paths in a
medical knowledge graph. We show that those graphs can be refined using latent
representations with RDF2vec, while the final diagnosis is still made in an
explainable way. Using both an intrinsic as well as an expert-based evaluation,
we show that the embedding-based prediction approach is beneficial for refining
the graph with additional valid conditions.

This year marks the $101$-st
anniversary of R.U.R., a play by the writer Karel \v{C}apek, often credited
with introducing the word ""robot"". The word used to refer to feudal forced
labourers in Slavic languages. Indeed, it points to one key characteristic of
robotic systems: they are mere slaves, have no rights, and execute our wills
instruction by instruction, without asking anything in return. The relationship
with us humans is commensalism; in biology, commensalism subsists between two
symbiotic species when one species benefits from it (robots boost productivity
for humans), while the other species neither benefits nor is harmed (can you
really argue that robots benefit from simply functioning?).
  We then distinguish robots from ""living machines"", that is, machines infused
with life. If living machines should ever become a reality, we would need to
shift our relationship with them from commensalism to mutualism. The
distinction is not subtle: we experience it every day with domesticated
animals, that exchange serfdom for forage and protection. This is because life
has evolved to resist any attempt at enslaving it; it is stubborn.
  In the path towards living machines, let us ask: what has been achieved by
robotics in the last $100$ years? What is left to accomplish in the next $100$
years? For us, the answers boil down to three words: juice, need (or death),
and embodiment, as we shall see in the following.

status updating system, focusing on determining the stationary AoI-distribution
of the system. Firstly, let the queue model be Ber/G/1/1, we obtain the
AoI-distribution by introducing a two-dimensional AoI-stochastic process and
solving its steady state, which describes the random evolutions of AoI and age
of packet in system simultaneously. In this case, actually we analyze a more
general queue called probabilistic preemption Ber/G/1/1, where the packet
service is allowed to be preempted with certain probabilities. As a special
case, stationary AoI-distribution for the system with Ber/Geo/1/1 queue is
obtained either. For the system having size 2, two specific queues are
considered, i.e., the Ber/Geo/1/2 and Ber/Geo/1/2* queues. The core idea to
find the stationary AoI-distribution is that the random transitions of
three-dimensional vector including AoI at the receiver, the packet age in
service, and the age of waiting packet can be fully described, such that a
three-dimensional AoI process is constituted. The stationary distribution of
three-dimensional process then gives the stationary AoI distribution as one of
its marginal distributions. For both cases, the explicit expressions of
AoI-distribution are derived, thus giving the complete description of the
steady state AoI for the system. For all the cases, since the steady state of a
larger-dimensional AoI process is solved, so that except the AoI-distribution,
we obtain more. For instance, the distributions of packet system time and
waiting time for size-two updating system, and the so-called violation
probabilities that AoI exceeds certain threshold.

Based on first-principles calculations, we investigated the thermodynamics of
hydrogen monomers and dimers at finite temperatures within the harmonic
approximation. The free energies of formation indicate that the population of
H$^{-}$ cannot be neglected when compared that of H$^{+}$ at high temperatures.
The results allow us to propose that the formation of molecules occurs during
cooling processes, in the temperature window $T\sim700\textrm{-}500\,$K, above
which the molecules collide with Si-Si bonds and dissociate, and below which
the fraction of H$^{-}$ becomes negligible. The formation of H$^{-}$ and most
notably of a fast-diffusing neutral species could also provide an explanation
for the apparent \emph{accelerated} diffusivity of atomic hydrogen at elevated
temperatures in comparison to the figures extrapolated from measurements
carried out at cryogenic temperatures. We finally show that the observed

becomes spatially non-local. This non-locality gives rise to phenomena such as
hydrodynamic flow in transport and the anomalous skin effect in optics. In
systems characterized by an anisotropic electronic dispersion, the non-local
dynamics becomes dependent on the relative orientation of the sample with
respect to the applied field, in ways that go beyond the usual, homogeneous
response. Such orientational dependence should manifest itself not only in
transport experiments, as recently observed, but also in optical spectroscopy.
In this paper we develop a kinetic theory for the distribution function and the
transverse conductivity of two- and three-dimensional Fermi systems with
anisotropic electronic dispersion. By expanding the collision integral into the
eigenbasis of a collision operator, we include momentum-relaxing scattering as
well as momentum-conserving collisions. We examine the isotropic 2D case as a
reference, as well as anisotropic hexagonal and square Fermi-surface shapes. We
apply our theory to the quantitative calculation of the skin depth and the
surface impedance, in all regimes of skin effect. We find qualitative
differences between the frequency dependence of the impedance in isotropic and
anisotropic systems. Such differences are shown to persist even for more
complex 2D Fermi surfaces, including the ''supercircle'' geometry and an
experimental parametrization for PdCoO$_2$, which deviate from an ideal
polygonal shape. We study the orientational dependence of skin effect due to
Fermi-surface anisotropy, thus providing guidance for the experimental study of
non-local optical effects.

examined the mechanisms of pain associated with trauma or cancer-related
skeletal damage focusing on new approaches for the development of innovative
therapeutic interventions. In particular, the current review highlights tissue
engineering approaches that offer considerable promise in the application of
functional biomimetic fabrication of bone and nerve tissues, resembling the

deterministic, not requiring parameter tuning and hyperparameters. DONE
overcomes a severe problem of existing weight imprinting methods that

performance of DONE depends entirely on the pretrained DNN model used as a
backbone model, and we confirmed that DONE with current well-trained backbone

Existing works often utilize fine-tuning or resort to extra attribute
classifiers, yet suffer from storage and inference time increases. To address
these concerns, we explore attribute-based CTG in a prompt-based manner. In
short, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained
continuous vector (i.e., single-attribute prompt) and guides the generation of
a fixed PLM switch to a pre-specified attribute. We experimentally find that
these prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole to multi-attribute CTG
without any re-training, yet raises problems of fluency decrease and position
sensitivity. To this end, Tailor provides a multi-attribute prompt mask and a
re-indexing position-ids sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one
prompt for each task) and testing stage (concatenating more than one prompt).
To further enhance such single-attribute prompt combinations, Tailor also
introduces a trainable prompt connector, which can be concatenated with any two
single-attribute prompts to multi-attribute text generation. Experiments on 11
attribute-specific generation tasks demonstrate strong performances of Tailor
on both single-attribute and multi-attribute CTG, with 0.08\% training

a model at the particle level to describe the structural degradation caused by
phase transition in terms of loss of active material (LAM), loss of lithium

then incorporated into a cell-level P2D model to explore the effects of LAM and

to the capacity loss, and that the loss of positive electrode active materials
dominates the fade of usable cell capacity in discharge. The available capacity
at a given current rate is further decreased by the additional resistance of
the degraded shell layer. The change pattern of the state-of-charge curve
provides information of more dimensions than the conventional capacity-fade
curve, beneficial to the diagnosis of degradation modes. The model has been

Shannon by aiming to transmit the meaning of a message, i.e., semantics, rather
than its exact copy and thus allows for savings in information rate. In this
work, we extend the fundamental approach from Basu et al. for modeling
semantics to the complete communications Markov chain. Thus, we model semantics
by means of hidden random variables and define the semantic communication task
as the data-reduced and reliable transmission of messages over a communication
channel such that semantics is best preserved. We cast this task as an
end-to-end Information Bottleneck problem allowing for compression while
preserving relevant information at most. As a solution approach, we propose the
ML-based semantic communication system SINFONY and use it for a distributed
multipoint scenario: SINFONY communicates the meaning behind multiple messages
that are observed at different senders to a single receiver for semantic
recovery. We analyze SINFONY by processing images as message examples.

given p-mode, as an explicit function of the statistical properties of the
turbulent velocity field. We reduce the stochastic wave equation to complex
amplitude equations for the normal oscillating modes of the system. We then
derive the equivalent Fokker-Planck equation for the real amplitudes and phases
of all the oscillating modes of the system simultaneously. The effect of the
finite-memory time of the turbulent fluctuations (comparable to the period of
the modes) on the modes themselves is consistently and rigorously accounted
for, by means of the simplified amplitude equation formalism. This formalism
accounts for mutual linear mode coupling in full, and we then turn to the
special single-mode case. This allows us to derive evolution equations for the
mean energy and mean phase of each mode, from which the excitation rate, the
damping rate, and the modal surface effect naturally arise.
  We show that the expression for the excitation rate of the modes is identical
to previous results obtained through a different modelling approach, thus
supporting the validity of the formalism presented here. We also recover the
fact that the damping rate and modal surface effect correspond to the real and
imaginary part of the same single complex quantity. We explicitly separate the
different physical contributions to these observables, in particular the
turbulent pressure contribution and the joint effect of the
pressure-rate-of-strain correlation and the turbulent dissipation. We show that
the former dominates for high-frequency modes and the latter for low-frequency

  URLLC Systems","Accepted in IEEE Communications Letters",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is proposed for
maximizing the achievable finite blocklength (FBL) rate while minimizing the
utilized channel blocklengths (CBLs) in a reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-assisted short packet communication system. The formulated MOOP has two
objective functions namely maximizing the total FBL rate with a target error
probability, and minimizing the total utilized CBLs which is directly
proportional to the transmission duration. The considered MOOP variables are
the base station (BS) transmit power, number of CBLs, and passive beamforming
at the RIS. Since the proposed non-convex problem is intractable to solve, the
Tchebyshev method is invoked to transform it into a single-objective OP, then
the alternating optimization (AO) technique is employed to iteratively obtain
optimized parameters in three main sub-problems. The numerical results show a
fundamental trade-off between maximizing the achievable rate in the FBL regime
and reducing the transmission duration. Also, the applicability of RIS
technology is emphasized in reducing the utilized CBLs while increasing the
achievable rate significantly.

DPPM can determine a DLC direction by solving a two-dimensional quadratic
optimization problem, regardless of the dimensionally of the function

one-dimensional optimization problem. This gives the DPPM advantage over
competitive methods when dealing with large-scale problems, involving a large
number of variables. We show that the DPPM converges to critical points of f.
We also provide conditions under which the entire DPPM sequence converges to a

stellar rotation of the host galaxies. Specifically, we study how the

Similarly, AGN feedback has a key role in reproducing the dichotomy between

star formation suppression due to AGN feedback, the number of fast rotators
strongly exceeds the observational constraints. Our study shows that there are

nonconvex constraints into the optimization for motion planning, which makes
the optimal control problem hard to handle. One efficient approach to address
this issue is Successive Convex Approximation (SCA), where the nonconvex
problem is convexified and solved successively. However, this approach still
faces two main challenges: I) infeasibility, caused by linearisation about
infeasible reference points; ii) high computational complexity incurred by
multiple constraints, when solving the optimal control problem with a long
planning horizon and multiple obstacles. To overcome these challanges, this
paper proposes an energy efficient safetyaware control method for motion
planning with low computing complexity and address these challenges.
Specifically, a control barrier function-based linear quadratic regulator is
formulated for the motion planning to guarantee safety and energy efficiency.
Then, to avoid infeasibility, Backward Receding SCA (BRSCA) approach with a
dynamic constraints-selection rule is proposed. Dynamic programming with
primal-dual iteration is designed to decrease computational complexity. It is
found that BRSCA is applicable to time-varying control limits. Numerical
simulations and hardware experiments vevify the efficiency of BRSCA.
Simulations demonstrates that BRSCA has a higher probability of finding
feasible solutions, reduces the computation time by about 17.4% and the energy
cost by about four times compared to other methods in the literature.

are a common choice for optimization functions. Unfortunately, contrastive ICR
methods are vulnerable to predictive feature suppression. Predictive features
are features that correctly indicate the similarity between a query and a
candidate item. However, in the presence of multiple predictive features during
training, encoder models tend to suppress redundant predictive features, since
these features are not needed to learn to discriminate between positive and
negative pairs. While some predictive features are redundant during training,
these features might be relevant during evaluation. We introduce an approach to
reduce predictive feature suppression for resource-constrained ICR methods:
latent target decoding (LTD). We add an additional decoder to the contrastive
ICR framework, to reconstruct the input caption in a latent space of a
general-purpose sentence encoder, which prevents the image and caption encoder
from suppressing predictive features. We implement the LTD objective as an
optimization constraint, to ensure that the reconstruction loss is below a
bound value while primarily optimizing for the contrastive loss. Importantly,
LTD does not depend on additional training data or expensive (hard) negative
mining strategies. Our experiments show that, unlike reconstructing the input
caption in the input space, LTD reduces predictive feature suppression,
measured by obtaining higher recall@k, r-precision, and nDCG scores than a
contrastive ICR baseline. Moreover, we show that LTD should be implemented as
an optimization constraint instead of a dual optimization objective. Finally,
we show that LTD can be used with different contrastive learning losses and a
wide variety of resource-constrained ICR methods.

fact that, with upon decreasing the QE-MoS$_2$ distance, the QEs become so
hybridized with the EP that one or two bound states are formed between them.
Our result supplies a useful way to avoid the destructive impact of EP damping,
and it refreshes our understanding of the light-matter interaction in absorbing

in the high density regime, a fraction of the dimers become rotationally jammed
into local clusters, and the system exhibits spinodal-decomposition like
two-phase morphologies. For high enough densities, the system becomes
completely jammed in both rotational and translational degrees of freedom. Such
a simple system is found to exhibit rich and multiscale disordered
hyperuniformities among the above phases: the absorbing state shows a critical
hyperuniformity of the strongest class and subcritically preserves the
vanishing density-fluctuation scaling up to some length scale; the
locally-jammed state shows a two-phase hyperuniformity conversely beyond some
length scale with respect to the phase cluster sizes; the totally jammed state
appears to be a monomer crystal, but intrinsically loses large-scale
hyperuniformity. These results are inspiring for designing novel

suggested as a reliable tool to infer neutron skin thicknesses. To this aim,
various experiments have been performed, especially on 208Pb. Purpose: We
analyze the sensitivity of that reaction process to the nucleonic density, and
especially to the neutron skin thickness, for 12C, 40Ca and 208Pb, for which
reliable data exist, and on 116,124Sn, for which measurements have been
performed in Mainz. We study also the role played by the {\pi}0-nucleus

impulse approximation considering either plane waves or distorted waves to
describe the {\pi}0-nucleus scattering in the outgoing channel. Results: Our
calculations are in good agreement with existing data, especially for 208Pb.
The sensitivity of the theoretical cross sections to the choice of the
nucleonic density is small, and below the experimental resolution. Conclusions:
Coherent {\pi}0 photoproduction is mostly an isoscalar observable that bares no
practical sensitivity to the neutron skin thickness. To infer that structure
observable it should be coupled to other reaction measurements, such as
electron scattering, or by comparing experiments performed on isotopes of the
same chemical element.

in the generalized polarizabilities, our formalism allows to calculate the
total density of multipole modes, regardless of a specific illumination, which
is not possible with the conventional multipole expansion. Finally, our
approach directly provides the optimum illumination field distributions that
maximally couple to specific multipole modes. The formalism will be very useful
for various applications in nano-optics like illumination-field engineering, or

Using a Fisher matrix formalism, we investigate how the measurement precision
of source parameters degrades as a function of the size of the assumed
calibration uncertainties. If we require that parameter measurements are
degraded by no more than a factor of two relative to their value in the absence
of calibration error, we find that calibration errors should be smaller than a

investigate the possibility of using verification binaries and EMRIs to
constrain calibration uncertainties. Verification binaries can constrain
amplitude calibration uncertainties at the level of a few percent, while both

for at least low-mass ($1\times10^{10}<M_*/\rm M_{\odot} \lessapprox 4 \times

data sets is weak supervision, which introduces problems of noisy labels,
coverage and bias. Methods for overcoming these problems have either relied on
discriminative models, trained with cost functions specific to weak
supervision, and more recently, generative models, trying to model the output
of the automatic annotation process. In this work, we explore a novel direction
of generative modeling for weak supervision: Instead of modeling the output of
the annotation process (the labeling function matches), we generatively model
the input-side data distributions (the feature space) covered by labeling
functions. Specifically, we estimate a density for each weak labeling source,
or labeling function, by using normalizing flows. An integral part of our
method is the flow-based modeling of multiple simultaneously matching labeling
functions, and therefore phenomena such as labeling function overlap and
correlations are captured. We analyze the effectiveness and modeling
capabilities on various commonly used weak supervision data sets, and show that
weakly supervised normalizing flows compare favorably to standard weak
supervision baselines.

equatorial Rossby modes in the beta-plane approximation. Since then, a rich
spectrum of inertial modes has been observed on the Sun, which is not limited
to the equatorial Rossby modes and includes high-latitude modes.
  Here we extend the computation of toroidal modes in 2D to spherical geometry,
using realistic solar differential rotation and including viscous damping. The
aim is to compare the computed mode spectra with the observations and to study
mode stability.
  At fixed radius, we solve the eigenvalue problem numerically using a
spherical harmonics decomposition of the velocity stream function. Due to the
presence of viscous critical layers, the spectrum consists of four different
families: Rossby modes, high-latitude modes, critical-latitude modes, and
strongly damped modes. For each longitudinal wavenumber m<4, up to three
Rossby-like modes are present on the sphere, in contrast to the equatorial beta
plane where only the equatorial Rossby mode is present. The least damped modes
in the model have eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions that resemble the
observed modes; the comparison improves when the radius is taken in the lower
half of the convection zone. For radii above 0.75R and Ekman numbers E<10^{-4},
at least one mode is unstable. For either m=1 or m=2, up to two Rossby modes
are unstable when the radial dependence of the Ekman number follows a quenched
diffusivity model (E=2. 10^{-5} at the base of the convection zone). For m=3,
up to two Rossby modes can be unstable, including the equatorial Rossby mode.
  Although the 2D model discussed here is highly simplified, the spectrum of
toroidal modes appears to include many of the observed solar inertial modes.
The self-excited modes in the model have frequencies close to those of the
observed modes with the largest amplitudes.

the research of distributed deep learning has become pronounced. Two common
approaches to achieve this distributed learning is synchronous and asynchronous
weight update. In this manuscript, we have explored very simplistic synchronous
weight update mechanisms. It has been seen that with an increasing number of
worker nodes, the performance degrades drastically. This effect has been
studied in the context of extreme imbalanced classification (e.g. outlier
detection). In practical cases, the assumed conditions of i.i.d. may not be
fulfilled. There may also arise global class imbalance situations like that of
outlier detection where the local servers receive severely imbalanced data and
may not get any samples from the minority class. In that case, the DNNs in the
local servers will get completely biased towards the majority class that they
receive. This would highly impact the learning at the parameter server (which
practically does not see any data). It has been observed that in a parallel
setting if one uses the existing federated weight update mechanisms at the
parameter server, the performance degrades drastically with the increasing
number of worker nodes. This is mainly because, with the increasing number of
nodes, there is a high chance that one worker node gets a very small portion of
the data, either not enough to train the model without overfitting or having a
highly imbalanced class distribution. The chapter, hence, proposes a workaround
to this problem by introducing the concept of adaptive cost-sensitive momentum
averaging. It is seen that for the proposed system, there was no to minimal
degradation in performance while most of the other methods hit their bottom
performance before that.

the open, high, low and close (OHLC) prices of the stocks. Literature lacks the
study on the inherent property of OHLC prices. We argue that predicting the
OHLC prices for the next day is much more informative than predicting the
trends of the stocks as the trend is mostly calculated using these OHLC prices
only. The problem mainly is focused on Buy-Today Sell-Tomorrow (BTST) trading.
In this regard, AEs when pre-trained with the stock prices, may be beneficial.
A novel framework is proposed where a pre-trained encoder is cascaded in front
of the multi-task predictor network. This hybrid network can leverage the power
of a combination of networks and can both handle the OHLC constraints as well
as capture any sudden drastic changes in the prices. It is seen that such a
network is much more efficient at predicting stock prices. The experiments have
been extended to recommend the most profitable and most overbought stocks on

finite-temperature one-loop corrected effective potential and searches for
SFOEWPTs. An SFOEWPT is found to be allowed in a broad range of the parameter
space. Furthermore, there are parameter scenarios where spontaneous CP
violation is generated at finite temperature. The in addition spontaneously
broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry then leads to mixing between the dark and the
visible sector so that CP violation in the dark is promoted at finite
temperature to the visible sector and thereby provides additional sources of CP
violation that are not restricted by the electric dipole moment measurements at
zero temperature. Thus, `CP in the Dark' provides a promising candidate for the

Inspired by the conventional pooling layers in CNNs, many recent graph learning
approaches have introduced the pooling strategy to reduce the size of graphs
for learning, such that the scalability and efficiency can be improved.
However, these pooling-based methods are mainly tailored to a single
graph-level task and pay more attention to local information, limiting their
performance in multi-task settings which often require task-specific global
information. In this paper, departure from these pooling-based efforts, we
design a new approach called DOTIN (\underline{D}r\underline{o}pping

of graphs. Specifically, by introducing $K$ learnable virtual nodes to
represent the graph embeddings targeted to $K$ different graph-level tasks,
respectively, up to 90\% raw nodes with low attentiveness with an attention
model -- a transformer in this paper, can be adaptively dropped without notable
performance decreasing. Achieving almost the same accuracy, our method speeds
up GAT by about 50\% on graph-level tasks including graph classification and
graph edit distance (GED) with about 60\% less memory, on D\&D dataset. Code

introduced to the causal inference literature. Exact balancing alleviates the
extreme weight and model misspecification issues that may incur when one
implements inverse probability weighting. It eliminates covariate imbalance by
imposing balancing constraints in an optimization problem. The optimization
problem can nevertheless be infeasible when there is bad overlap between the
covariate distributions in the treated and control groups or when the
covariates are high-dimensional. Recently, approximate balancing was proposed
as an alternative balancing framework, which resolves the feasibility issue by
using inequality moment constraints instead. However, it can be difficult to
select the threshold parameters when the number of constraints is large.
Moreover, moment constraints may not fully capture the discrepancy of covariate
distributions. In this paper, we propose Mahalanobis balancing, which
approximately balances covariate distributions from a multivariate perspective.
We use a quadratic constraint to control overall imbalance with a single
threshold parameter, which can be tuned by a simple selection procedure. We
show that the dual problem of Mahalanobis balancing is an l_2 norm-based
regularized regression problem, and establish interesting connection to
propensity score models. We further generalize Mahalanobis balancing to the
high-dimensional scenario. We derive asymptotic properties and make extensive
comparisons with existing balancing methods in the numerical studies.

describing the dust in these regions, we aim to shed light on the role of low

far-infrared at 70 micron and 160 micron to derive dust temperatures and dust
masses in the wind-ISM interaction regions around a sample of carbon-rich and
oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The dust temperature and mass
are determined in two ways. First directly from the data using the ratio of the
measured fluxes and assuming opacities for dust with a constant grain size of
0.1 micron. We then perform 3D dust-radiative transfer models spatially
constrained by the observations to consistently calculate the temperature and
mass. For the radiative transfer models each model contains one constant grain
size, which is varied between 0.01 micron to 5.0 micron. We find that the
observed dust mass in the wind-ISM interaction regions is consistent with mass
accumulated from the stellar winds. For the carbon-rich sources adding the
spatial constraints in the radiative transfer models results in preferentially
larger grain sizes (approx. 2 micron). For the oxygen-rich sources the spatial
constraints result in too high temperatures in the models, making it impossible
to fit the observed far-infrared ratio irrespective of the grain size used,
indicating a more complex interplay of grain properties and the stellar
radiation field. The results have implications for how likely it is for the
grains to survive the transition into the ISM, and the properties of dust
particles that later act as seeds for grain growth in the ISM. However, the
results for the oxygen-rich sources show that the derivation of dust properties
is not straight forward, requiring more complex modelling

CIR of the RX depends on the exact location of the TX. By averaging over all
possible TX locations, we analyze the expected molecule hitting rate at the RX

microstructure of the polymer chains. To investigate the unsteady structural
changes induced by polymer chain morphology under stress, we develop a simple
rheo-optical technique combining a high-speed polarization camera and
dripping-onto-substrate capillary breakup extensional rheometry (CaBER-DoS),
which uniaxially extends and aligns the polymer along the stress direction.
Using this technique, the viscoelastic behavior and birefringence field of an
extending liquid polymer are simultaneously measured. Unlike the conditions
that occur under shear-stress loading with a rotational rheometer, this
technique provides a linear relation between birefringence and extensional
stress. The measurements reflect the structural change in a flexible polymer (a
mixed solution of PEO and CNCs) in the temporal evolution of the birefringence
and orientation angle, which is a measure of the orientation state and
coil-stretch transition of a polymer chain. Remarkably, within the
elasto-capillary regime, the measured birefringence remains constant with a
constant orientation state, while the Weissenberg number gradually increases,
which provides experimental evidence of the coil-stretch transition of the
polymer chain under constant extensional stress loading.

resulted in key atmospheric constraints under the assumption of a gray surface,
but the effect of wavelength-dependent surface albedo on retrieval has not been
shown. We explore the influence of the coupling effect of cloud and
wavelength-dependent surface albedo on retrieval performance via modeling
suites of Earth-like atmospheres with varying cloud and surface albedo
parameterizations. Under the assumption of known cloud scattering properties,
the surface spectral albedos can be reasonably recovered when the surface cover
represents that of Earth-like vegetation or ocean, which may aid in
characterizing the planet's habitability. When the cloud scattering properties
cannot be assumed, we show that the degeneracy between the cloud properties and
wavelength-dependent surface albedo leads to biased results of atmospheric and
cloud properties. The multi-epoch visible band observations offer limited
improvement in disentangling this degeneracy. However, the constraints on
atmospheric properties from the combination of UV band (R $\sim 6$) $+$ visible
band (R $\sim 140$) are consistent with input values to within 1 $\sigma$. If
short bandpass data is not available, an alternative solution to reduce the
retrieval uncertainties would be to have the prior constraints on planetary

abundant cues available, however, this comes at the expense of large-scale

propose to learn light field saliency from pixel-level noisy labels obtained
from unsupervised hand crafted featured based saliency methods. Given this
goal, a natural question is: can we efficiently incorporate the relationships
among light field cues while identifying clean labels in a unified framework?
We address this question by formulating the learning as a joint optimization of
intra light field features fusion stream and inter scenes correlation stream to
generate the predictions. Specially, we first introduce a pixel forgetting
guided fusion module to mutually enhance the light field features and exploit
pixel consistency across iterations to identify noisy pixels. Next, we
introduce a cross scene noise penalty loss for better reflecting latent
structures of training data and enabling the learning to be invariant to noise.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our framework showing that it learns saliency prediction
comparable to state-of-the-art fully supervised light field saliency methods.

The capacity of a link $(u,v)$ is determined by how much players $u$ and $v$
allocate for this link. Specifically, the input is a finite ordered sequence of
packets that arrive in both directions along a link. Given $(u, v)$ and a
packet of weight $x$ going from $u$ to $v$, player $u$ can either accept or
reject the packet. If player $u$ accepts the packet, their capacity on link
$(u,v)$ decreases by $x$. Correspondingly, player $v$ capacity on $(u,v)$
increases by $x$. If a player rejects the packet, this will entail a cost
linear in the weight of the packet. A link is ""rechargeable"" in the sense that
the total capacity of the link has to remain constant, but the allocation of
capacity at the ends of the link can depend arbitrarily on players' decisions.
The goal is to minimise the sum of the capacity injected into the link and the
cost of rejecting packets. We show the problem is NP-hard, but can be

a linear program. This linearization allows us to solve the model
quantitatively and to precisely characterize the regions and patterns of

nonlocally. We introduce two notions of bunching - blunt bunching and targeted
bunching. Blunt bunching constitutes 30 percent of all bunching, occurs at the
lowest regions of cognitive and manual skills, and lumps the allocations of
these workers resulting in a significant distortion. Targeted bunching
constitutes 70 percent of all bunching and recognizes the workers' comparative
advantage. The planner separates workers on their dominant skill and bunches
them on their weaker skill, thus mitigating distortions along the dominant
skill dimension. Tax wedges are particularly high for low skilled workers who
are bluntly bunched and are also high along the dimension of comparative
disadvantage for somewhat more skilled workers who are targetedly bunched.

thanks to their ability to overcome line-of-sight blockages in mmWave systems,
enabling in turn accurate localization with minimal infrastructure. Less
investigated are however the benefits of exploiting RIS with suitably designed
beamforming strategies for optimized localization and synchronization
performance. In this paper, a novel low-complexity method for joint
localization and synchronization based on an optimized design of the base
station (BS) active precoding and RIS passive phase profiles is proposed, for
the challenging case of a single-antenna receiver. The theoretical position
error bound is first derived and used as metric to jointly optimize the BS-RIS
beamforming, assuming a priori knowledge of the user position. By exploiting
the low-dimensional structure of the solution, a novel codebook-based robust
design strategy with optimized beam power allocation is then proposed, which
provides low-complexity while taking into account the uncertainty on the user
position. Finally, a reduced-complexity maximum-likelihood based estimation
procedure is devised to jointly recover the user position and the
synchronization offset. Extensive numerical analysis shows that the proposed
joint BS-RIS beamforming scheme provides enhanced localization and
synchronization performance compared to existing solutions, with the proposed
estimator attaining the theoretical bounds even at low signal-to-noise-ratio
and in the presence of additional uncontrollable multipath propagation.

studied due to their high applicability in various real-world scenarios.
However, it might happen that no stable solution exists, or stable solutions do
not meet certain requirements. In such cases, one might be interested in
modifying the instance so that the existence of a stable outcome with the
desired properties is ensured.
  We focus on three different modifications. In stable roommates problems with
all capacities being one, we give a simpler proof to show that removing an
agent from each odd cycle of a stable partition is optimal. We further show
that the problem becomes NP-complete if the capacities are greater than one, or
the deleted agents must belong to a fixed subset of vertices.
  Motivated by inverse optimization problems, we investigate how to modify the
preferences of the agents as little as possible so that a given matching
becomes stable. The deviation of the new preferences from the original ones can
be measured in various ways; here we concentrate on the $\ell_1$-norm. We show
that, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, the problem does not admit a better
than $2$ approximation. By relying on bipartite-submodular functions, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm for the bipartite case. We also show that a similar
approach leads to a 2-approximation for general graphs.
  Last, we consider problems where the preferences of agents are not fully
prescribed, and the goal is to decide whether the preference lists can be
extended so that a stable matching exists. We settle the complexity of several
variants, including cases when some of the edges are required to be included or

modeling of a massive binary consisting of a magnetar and an early-type star.
We model the interaction of the pulsar wind from the magnetar with an intense

radio emission can escape the system. This explains the duty cycle of the two
repeating FRB sources with periodic activity. The width of the transparency
window depends on the eccentricity, stellar wind properties, and the viewing
angle. To describe properties of the known sources it is necessary to assume
large eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.5$. We apply the maser cyclotron mechanism of
the radio emission generation to model spectral properties of the sources. The
produced spectrum is not wide: $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.2$ and the typical
frequency depends on the radius of the shock where the emission is generated.
The shock radius changes along the orbit. This, together with changing
parameters of the medium, allows us to explain the frequency drift during the
phase of visibility. Frequency dependence of the degree of polarization at few
GHz can be a consequence of a small scale turbulence in the shocked stellar
wind. It is much more difficult to explain huge ($\sim 10^5$ [rad/m$^2$]) and
variable value of the rotation measure observed for FRB 121102. We suggest that
this can be explained if the supernova explosion which produced the magnetar
happened near a dense interstellar cloud with $n \sim100$ cm$^{-3}$.

short-time delays between star formation and BBH mergers. Using a power law
form for the time delay distribution ($(t^{\rm min}_d)^{d}$) we find $d<-0.7$
credible at $90\%$ interval. The mass distribution of the BBHs {could be
fitted} with a power-law form with {a redshift-dependent peak feature that can
be linked to the pair instability supernovae (PISN) mass scale $M_{\rm

theoretical prediction of the lower edge of the PISN mass scale and differs
from previous analyses. Although we find a strong dependence of the PISN value
on metallicity, the model that we explored is not strongly favored over those

reflectance, have become an important data source in natural and social
sciences. Hyperspectral images are often generated in large quantities at a
relatively coarse spatial resolution. As such, unsupervised machine learning
algorithms incorporating known structure in hyperspectral imagery are needed to
analyze these images automatically. This work introduces the Spatial-Spectral
Image Reconstruction and Clustering with Diffusion Geometry (DSIRC) algorithm
for partitioning highly mixed hyperspectral images. DSIRC reduces measurement
noise through a shape-adaptive reconstruction procedure. In particular, for
each pixel, DSIRC locates spectrally correlated pixels within a data-adaptive
spatial neighborhood and reconstructs that pixel's spectral signature using
those of its neighbors. DSIRC then locates high-density, high-purity pixels far
in diffusion distance (a data-dependent distance metric) from other
high-density, high-purity pixels and treats these as cluster exemplars, giving
each a unique label. Non-modal pixels are assigned the label of their diffusion
distance-nearest neighbor of higher density and purity that is already labeled.
Strong numerical results indicate that incorporating spatial information
through image reconstruction substantially improves the performance of
pixel-wise clustering.

study this decomposition and use it to outline a new heuristic for PESP, based

the space of fractional cycle offsets is in fact a zonotope. We relate its

we also use this new understanding to give tight lower bounds on the minimum

transformative technology for future wireless communications. However, RISs'
inability to process signals and the attendant increased channel dimension have
brought new challenges to RIS-assisted systems, including significantly
increased pilot overhead required for channel estimation. To address these
problems, several prior contributions that enhance the hardware architecture of
RISs or develop algorithms to exploit the channels' mathematical properties
have been made, where the required pilot overhead is reduced to be proportional
to the number of RIS elements. In this paper, we propose a
dimension-independent channel state information (CSI) acquisition approach in
which the required pilot overhead is independent of the number of RIS elements.
Specifically, in contrast to traditional signal transmission methods, where
signals from the base station (BS) and the users are transmitted in different
time slots, we propose a novel method in which signals are transmitted from the
BS and the user simultaneously during CSI acquisition. With this method, an
electromagnetic interference random field (IRF) will be induced on the RIS, and
we propose the structure of sensing RIS to capture its features. Moreover, we
develop three algorithms for parameter estimation in this system, in which one
of the proposed vM-EM algorithm is analyzed with the fixed-point perturbation
method to obtain an asymptotic achievable bound. In addition, we also derive
the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and an asymptotic expression for
characterizing the best possible performance of the proposed algorithms.
Simulation results verify that our proposed signal transmission method and the
corresponding algorithms can achieve dimension-independent CSI acquisition for
beamforming.

also provides a non-perturbative procedure to reconstruct the surface elevation
from the wave envelope, based on the Birkhoff normal form transformation to
eliminate all non-resonant triads. This model is tested against direct

in-context learning performance heavily depends on the corpus domain source,
and the size of the pretraining corpus does not necessarily determine the
emergence of in-context learning, (2) in-context learning ability can emerge
when a language model is trained on a combination of multiple corpora, even
when each corpus does not result in in-context learning on its own, (3)
pretraining with a corpus related to a downstream task does not always
guarantee the competitive in-context learning performance of the downstream
task, especially in the few-shot setting, and (4) the relationship between
language modeling (measured in perplexity) and in-context learning does not
always correlate: e.g., low perplexity does not always imply high in-context
few-shot learning performance.

of a greater density, the injected fluid forms a plume that rises upwards due
to buoyancy. In the near-field of the injection point the plume adjusts its
speed to match the buoyancy velocity of the porous medium, either thinning or
thickening to conserve mass. These adjustments are the dominant controls on the
near-field plume shape, rather than mixing with the ambient fluid, which occurs
over larger vertical distances. In this study, we focus on the plume behaviour
in the near-field, demonstrating that for moderate injection rates the plume
will reach a steady state, whereby it matches the buoyancy velocity over a few
plume width-scales from the injection point. However, for very small injection
rates an instability occurs in which the steady plume breaks apart due to the
insurmountable density contrast with the surrounding fluid. The steady shape of
the plume in the near-field only depends on a single dimensionless parameter,
which is the ratio between the inlet velocity and the buoyancy velocity. A
linear stability analysis is performed, indicating that for small velocity
ratios an infinitesimal perturbation can be constructed that becomes unstable,
whilst for moderate velocity ratios the shape is shown to be stable. Finally,
we comment on the application of such flows to the context of CO$_2$
sequestration in porous geological reservoirs.

resource-intensive both to deploy and to fine-tune. Researchers have created
several methods for distilling language models into smaller ones to increase
efficiency, with a small performance trade-off. In this paper, we create
several different distilled versions of the state-of-the-art Dutch RobBERT
model and call them RobBERTje. The distillations differ in their distillation
corpus, namely whether or not they are shuffled and whether they are merged
with subsequent sentences. We found that the performance of the models using
the shuffled versus non-shuffled datasets is similar for most tasks and that
randomly merging subsequent sentences in a corpus creates models that train
faster and perform better on tasks with long sequences. Upon comparing
distillation architectures, we found that the larger DistilBERT architecture
worked significantly better than the Bort hyperparametrization. Interestingly,
we also found that the distilled models exhibit less gender-stereotypical bias
than its teacher model. Since smaller architectures decrease the time to
fine-tune, these models allow for more efficient training and more lightweight
deployment of many Dutch downstream language tasks.

analyze the Unruh-Fulling effect for a massless real scalar field in both the

identical to those of the standard Unruh-Fulling effect. The temperature of the

important to consider a scenario in which an attacker gains control over the

our analysis, we simulate a number of existing and planned LEO constellations
against an example GEO constellation, and evaluate the relative effectiveness
of each. Our model shows that with conservative power estimates, both current

groundstation considered, with effectiveness varying considerably between
locations. We analyse different patterns of interference, how they reflect the
structures of the constellations creating them, and how effective they might be
against a number of legitimate services. We found that real-time usage (e.g.

$\gamma$ and we then evaluate two different values of the said quantity in
comparison with classical methods in the field. This evaluation is conducted by
changing the amount of labeled data available and the number of nearest

laminar oblique shock wave / boundary layer interaction (SWBLI). It is shown
that the computed optimal gain, which can be seen as a transfer function of the
system, follows a first-order low-pass filter equation, recovering the results
of Touber and Sandham (JFM, 2011). This behaviour is understood as proceeding
from the excitation of a single stable, steady global mode whose damping rate
sets the time scale of the filter. Different Mach and Reynolds numbers are
studied, covering different recirculation lengths $L$. This damping rate is
found to scale as $1/L$, leading to a constant Strouhal number $St_L$ as
observed in the literature. It is associated with a breathing motion of the
recirculation bubble. This analysis furthermore supports the idea that the
low-frequency dynamics of the SWBLI is a forced dynamics, in which background
perturbations continuously excite the flow. The investigation is then carried
out for 3D perturbations for which two regimes are identified. At low wave
numbers of the order of $L$, a modal mechanism similar to that of 2D
perturbations is found and exhibits larger values of the optimal gain. At
larger wave numbers of the order of the boundary layer thickness, the growth of
streaks, which results from a non-modal mechanism, is detected. No interaction
with the recirculation region is observed. Based on these results, the
potential prevalence of 3D effects in the low-frequency dynamics of the SWBLI
is discussed.

showing the polariton nonlinearity causing fast relaxation correlated with the
pump so as to yield the condensation at threshold. Increasing the pump
intensity, a nonequilibrium phase transition towards the condensation of lower
polaritons emerges, with a statistics transiting from a thermal, through a
super-Poissonian and to a nonclassical distribution beyond the understanding at
the level of off-diagonal long-range order. The results signify the role of
dark states for polariton fluctuations, and lead to a nonclassical counting
statistics of emitted photons, which elaborates the role of the key parameters,
e.g., pump, detuning and temperature.

in 2017 and 1.4 $\textrm{nb}^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb collisions collected in 2018. In
both collision systems, jets are reconstructed via the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm.
The $b$-jets are identified from a sample of jets containing muons from the
semileptonic decay of $b$-quarks using template fits of the muon momentum
relative to the jet axis. In $pp$ collisions, $b$-jets are reconstructed for
radius parameters $R= 0.2$ and $R= 0.4$, and only $R= 0.2$ jets are used in
Pb+Pb collisions. For comparison, inclusive $R= 0.2$ jets are also measured
using 1.7 $\textrm{nb}^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb collisions collected in 2018 and the same
$pp$ collision data as the $b$-jet measurement. The nuclear modification
factor, $R_\textrm{AA}$, is calculated for both $b$-jets and inclusive jets
with $R= 0.2$ over the transverse momentum range of 80--290 GeV. The nuclear
modification factor for $b$-jets decreases from peripheral to central
collisions. The ratio of the $b$-jet $R_\textrm{AA}$ to inclusive jet
$R_\textrm{AA}$ is also presented and suggests that the $R_\textrm{AA}$ for
$b$-jets is larger than that for inclusive jets in central Pb+Pb collisions.
The measurements are compared with theoretical calculations and suggest a role
for mass and colour-charge effects in partonic energy loss in heavy-ion
collisions.

to help tackle disasters as they unfold. Whilst batch queue systems are not
ideal in supporting such workloads, many disadvantages can be worked around by
accurately predicting when a waiting job will start to run. However there are
numerous challenges in achieving such a prediction with high accuracy, not
least because the queue's state can change rapidly and depend upon many
factors. In this work we explore a novel machine learning approach for
predicting queue wait times, hypothesising that such a model can capture the
complex behaviour resulting from the queue policy and other interactions to
generate accurate job start times.
  For ARCHER2 (HPE Cray EX), Cirrus (HPE 8600) and 4-cabinet (HPE Cray EX) we
explore how different machine learning approaches and techniques improve the
accuracy of our predictions, comparing against the estimation generated by
Slurm. We demonstrate that our techniques deliver the most accurate predictions
across our machines of interest, with the result of this work being the ability
to predict job start times within one minute of the actual start time for
around 65\% of jobs on ARCHER2 and 4-cabinet, and 76\% of jobs on Cirrus. When
compared against what Slurm can deliver, this represents around 3.8 times
better accuracy on ARCHER2 and 18 times better for Cirrus. Furthermore our
approach can accurately predicting the start time for three quarters of all job
within ten minutes of the actual start time on ARCHER2 and 4-cabinet, and for
90\% of jobs on Cirrus. Whilst the driver of this work has been to better
facilitate placement of urgent workloads across HPC machines, the insights
gained can be used to provide wider benefits to users and also enrich existing

achieve their desired goals. In such videos, it is challenging for computer
vision systems to understand high-level concepts such as goal-directed

ability in artificially intelligent agents would make them better social
learners by allowing them to evaluate human action under a teleological lens.
To validate the ability of deep learning models to perform this task, we curate
the W-Oops dataset, built upon the Oops dataset [15]. W-Oops consists of 2,100
unintentional human action videos, with 44 goal-directed and 30 unintentional
video-level activity labels collected through human annotations. Due to the
expensive segment annotation procedure, we propose a weakly supervised

regions in the video leveraging solely video-level labels. In particular, we
employ an attention mechanism-based strategy that predicts the temporal regions
which contribute the most to a classification task. Meanwhile, our designed
overlap regularization allows the model to focus on distinct portions of the
video for inferring the goal-directed and unintentional activity while
guaranteeing their temporal ordering. Extensive quantitative experiments verify
the validity of our localization method. We further conduct a video captioning

exist spectral measures with arbitrary Hausdorff dimensions, and it is natural
to pose the question of whether similar phenomena occur for other dimensions of
spectral measures. In this paper, we first obtain the formulae of Assouad
dimension and of lower dimension for a class of Moran measures in dimension one
that is introduced by An and He [J. Funct. Anal. 266 (2014), 343--354]. Based
on these results, we show the existence of spectral measures with arbitrary
Assound dimensions $\dim_A$ and lower dimensions $\dim_L$ ranging from $0$ to
$1$, including non-atomic zero-dimensional spectral measures and
one-dimensional singular spectral measures, and prove that the two values may
coincide. In fact, more is obtained that for any $0 \leq t \leq s \leq r \leq
u\leq 1$, there exists a spectral measure $\mu$ such that \[\dim_L \mu=t,
\dim_H \mu=s, \dim_P\mu=r~ \text{and} \dim_A\mu=u,\] where $\dim_H$ and
$\dim_P$ denote the Hausdorff dimension and packing dimension of the measure
$\mu$, respectively. This result improves and generalizes the result of Dai and
Sun more simply and flexibly.

$L$-moments (Sittinen, 1969), $L$-skewness, and $L$-kurtosis (Hosking, 1990)
and introduce order numbers for a large class of $L$-functionals through
orthogonal series expansions of quantile functions. In particular, we motivate
why location, scale, skewness, and heavytailedness have order numbers 1, 2,
(3,2), and (4,2) respectively and describe how a family of $L$-functionals,
with different order numbers, is constructed from Legendre, Hermite, Laguerre

relationship between quantiles of the response and the covariates follow a
transformed linear model, with a link function that determines the appropriate
class of $L$-functionals. In this setting, the distribution of the response is
treated parametrically or nonparametrically, and the response variable is
either censored/truncated or not. We also provide a unified asymptotic theory
of estimates of $L$-functionals, and illustrate our approach by analyzing the
arrival time distribution of migrating birds. In this context a novel version

the necessity to keep the photocathodes at room temperature while being
surrounded by the cavity walls that are kept at cryogenic temperatures creates
an additional complexity for the SRF gun design and operation. The complex and

support for serverless-based training. However, the ability to train DL models
on serverless platforms is hindered by the resource limitations of today's
serverless infrastructure and DL models' explosive requirement for memory and
bandwidth. This paper describes FuncPipe, a novel pipelined training framework
specifically designed for serverless platforms that enable fast and low-cost
training of DL models. FuncPipe is designed with the key insight that model
partitioning can be leveraged to bridge both memory and bandwidth gaps between
the capacity of serverless functions and the requirement of DL training.
Conceptually simple, we have to answer several design questions, including how
to partition the model, configure each serverless function, and exploit each
function's uplink/downlink bandwidth. In particular, we tailor a micro-batch
scheduling policy for the serverless environment, which serves as the basis for
the subsequent optimization. Our Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming
formulation automatically and simultaneously configures serverless resources
and partitions models to fit within the resource constraints. Lastly, we
improve the bandwidth efficiency of storage-based synchronization with a novel
pipelined scatter-reduce algorithm. We implement FuncPipe on two popular cloud
serverless platforms and show that it achieves 7%-77% cost savings and
1.3X-2.2X speedup compared to state-of-the-art serverless-based frameworks.

In this paper, we employ and extend upon the notion of informational justice to
develop a framework for explicating issues of justice relating to
representation, participation, distribution of benefits and burdens, and
credibility in the misinformation detection pipeline. Drawing on the framework:
(1) we show how injustices materialize for stakeholders across three
algorithmic stages in the pipeline; (2) we suggest empirical measures for
assessing these injustices; and (3) we identify potential sources of these

intuitive insights into the data is a challenging topic in neuro-symbolic
research. We introduce a novel differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP)
model, called differentiable first-order rule learner (DFOL), which finds the
correct LPs from relational facts by searching for the interpretable matrix
representations of LPs. These interpretable matrices are deemed as trainable
tensors in neural networks (NNs). The NNs are devised according to the
differentiable semantics of LPs. Specifically, we first adopt a novel
propositionalization method that transfers facts to NN-readable vector pairs
representing interpretation pairs. We replace the immediate consequence
operator with NN constraint functions consisting of algebraic operations and a
sigmoid-like activation function. We map the symbolic forward-chained format of
LPs into NN constraint functions consisting of operations between subsymbolic
vector representations of atoms. By applying gradient descent, the trained well
parameters of NNs can be decoded into precise symbolic LPs in forward-chained
logic format. We demonstrate that DFOL can perform on several standard ILP
datasets, knowledge bases, and probabilistic relation facts and outperform
several well-known differentiable ILP models. Experimental results indicate
that DFOL is a precise, robust, scalable, and computationally cheap

day, also known as ultra-short period (USP) planets, formed further out within
their natal protoplanetary disk, before migrating to their current-day orbits
via dynamical interactions. One of the most accepted theories suggests a
violent scenario involving high-eccentricity migration followed by tidal
circularization. Here, we present the discovery of a four planet system
orbiting the bright (V=10.5) K6 dwarf star TOI-500. The innermost planet is a
transiting, Earth-sized USP planet with an orbital period of $\sim$ 13 hours, a
mass of 1.42 $\pm$ 0.18 M$_{\oplus}$, a radius of $1.166^{0.061}_{-0.058}$
R$_{\oplus}$, and a mean density of 4.89$^{+1.03}_{-0.88}$ gcm$^{-3}$. Via
Doppler spectroscopy, we discovered that the system hosts three outer planets
on nearly circular orbits with periods of 6.6, 26.2, and 61.3d and minimum
masses of 5.03 $\pm$ 0.41 M$_{\oplus}$, 33.12 $\pm$ 0.88 M$_{\oplus}$ and
15.05$^{+1.12}_{-1.11}$ M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. The presence of both a USP
planet and a low-mass object on a 6.6-day orbit indicates that the architecture
of this system can be explained via a scenario in which the planets started on
low-eccentricity orbits, then moved inwards through a quasi-static secular
migration. Our numerical simulations show that this migration channel can bring
TOI-500 b to its current location in 2 Gyrs, starting from an initial orbit of
0.02au. TOI-500 is the first four planet system known to host a USP Earth
analog whose current architecture can be explained via a non-violent migration
scenario.

image analysis. With the rapid development of deep learning, convolutional
neural networks (CNN) have dominated the medical image registration field. Due
to the disadvantage of the local receptive field of CNN, some recent
registration methods have focused on using transformers for non-local
registration. However, the standard Transformer has a vast number of parameters
and high computational complexity, which causes Transformer can only be applied
at the bottom of the registration models. As a result, only coarse information
is available at the lowest resolution, limiting the contribution of Transformer
in their models. To address these challenges, we propose a convolution-based
efficient multi-head self-attention (CEMSA) block, which reduces the parameters
of the traditional Transformer and captures local spatial context information
for reducing semantic ambiguity in the attention mechanism. Based on the
proposed CEMSA, we present a novel Symmetric Transformer-based model
(SymTrans). SymTrans employs the Transformer blocks in the encoder and the
decoder respectively to model the long-range spatial cross-image relevance. We
apply SymTrans to the displacement field and diffeomorphic registration.
Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in image registration. Our code is publicly available at

the scatters in the density of baryons and dark matter are strongly coupled at
large scales ($r>R_{200}$); but the coupling between gas and dark matter
density profiles fades near the core of halos ($r < 0.3 R_{200}$). We then show
that the correlation between halo profile and integrated quantities induces a
radius-dependent additive bias in the profile observables of halos when halos
are selected on properties other than their mass. We discuss the impact of this
effect on cluster abundance and cross-correlations cosmology with

have demonstrated the dependence of this chemistry on a number of experimental
parameters. One experimental parameter which has received significantly less
attention is that of the phase of the solid ice under investigation. In this
present study, we have performed systematic 2 keV electron irradiations of the
amorphous and crystalline phases of pure CH3OH and N2O astrophysical ice
analogues. Radiation-induced decay of these ices and the concomitant formation
of products were monitored in situ using FT-IR spectroscopy. A direct
comparison between the irradiated amorphous and crystalline CH3OH ices revealed
a more rapid decay of the former compared to the latter. Interestingly, a
significantly lesser difference was observed when comparing the decay rates of
the amorphous and crystalline N2O ices. These observations have been
rationalised in terms of the strength and extent of the intermolecular forces
present in each ice. The strong and extensive hydrogen-bonding network that
exists in crystalline CH3OH (but not in the amorphous phase) is suggested to
significantly stabilise this phase against radiation-induced decay. Conversely,
although alignment of the dipole moment of N2O is anticipated to be more
extensive in the crystalline structure, its weak attractive potential does not
significantly stabilise the crystalline phase against radiation-induced decay,
hence explaining the smaller difference in decay rates between the amorphous
and crystalline phases of N2O compared to those of CH3OH. Our results are
relevant to the astrochemistry of interstellar ices and icy Solar System
objects, which may experience phase changes due to thermally-induced
crystallisation or space radiation-induced amorphisation.

  in Low Dimensions",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) have been validated as powerful methods for
inferring missing links in knowledge graphs (KGs) since they map entities into
Euclidean space and treat relations as transformations of entities. Currently,
some Euclidean KGE methods model semantic hierarchies prevalent in KGs and
promote the performance of link prediction. For hierarchical data, instead of
traditional Euclidean space, hyperbolic space as an embedding space has shown
the promise of high fidelity and low memory consumption; however, existing
hyperbolic KGE methods neglect to model them. To address this issue, we propose
a novel KGE model -- hyperbolic hierarchical KGE (HypHKGE). To be specific, we
first design the attention-based learnable curvatures for hyperbolic space to
preserve rich semantic hierarchies. Moreover, we define the hyperbolic
hierarchical transformations based on the theory of hyperbolic geometry, which
utilize hierarchies that we preserved to infer the links. Experiments show that
HypHKGE can effectively model semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space and
outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperbolic methods, especially in low
dimensions.

expression are valuable sources of information for various clinical predictive
tasks. For example, predicting survival outcomes, cancer histology type and
other patients' related information is possible using not only clinical data
but molecular data as well. Moreover, using these data sources together, for
example in multitask learning, can boost the performance. However, in practice,
there are many missing data points which leads to significantly lower patient
numbers when analysing full cases, which in our setting refers to all
modalities being present.
  In this paper we investigate how imputing data with missing values using deep
learning coupled with multitask learning can help to reach state-of-the-art
performance results using combined genomics modalities, RNA, micro RNA and
methylation. We propose a generalised deep imputation method to impute values
where a patient has all modalities present except one. Interestingly enough,
deep imputation alone outperforms multitask learning alone for the
classification and regression tasks across most combinations of modalities. In
contrast, when using all modalities for survival prediction we observe that
multitask learning alone outperforms deep imputation alone with statistical
significance (adjusted p-value 0.03). Thus, both approaches are complementary
when optimising performance for downstream predictive tasks.

modalities are available. However, such a strong assumption does not always
hold in practice, and most of multimodal fusion models may fail when partial
modalities are missing. Several works have addressed the missing modality
problem; but most of them only considered the single modality missing case, and
ignored the practically more general cases of multiple modalities missing. To
this end, in this paper, we propose a Tag-Assisted Transformer Encoder (TATE)
network to handle the problem of missing uncertain modalities. Specifically, we
design a tag encoding module to cover both the single modality and multiple
modalities missing cases, so as to guide the network's attention to those
missing modalities. Besides, we adopt a new space projection pattern to align
common vectors. Then, a Transformer encoder-decoder network is utilized to
learn the missing modality features. At last, the outputs of the Transformer
encoder are used for the final sentiment classification. Extensive experiments
are conducted on CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP datasets, showing that our method can
achieve significant improvements compared with several baselines.

words, temporally and spatially distributed teams and organizations can develop
and work on a software application. The simplest case is to outsource
production and employ workforce at distributed sites so that multiple
distributed teams can work on a project within a parallel framework. If this
distribution is global, it will be called the global software evolution or
development. A higher level of distribution is defined as decentralization and
decentralized software evolution, which means that software development can be
independent of the initial provider. It also means that software execution is
independent of the initial provider and the initial system so that the software
application can easily be reused in different and new projects. However, the
high level architecture is managed within a practically centralized framework
in the decentralized software evolution. Most of the large scale open-source
projects are exemplars of this level. In terms of distribution, there is a
higher level of decentralized software evolution called ""distributed cognition
and leadership"". At this level of distribution, all system levels evolve within
a distributed framework, and there are no centralized points in the project
network and its evolution process. Some open-source software applications are
the exemplars of this last level. Not only is the distributed software
evolution faced with certain challenges and opportunities to reach its goals,
but it has also caused some challenges and opportunities in other fields. This
paper conducts a general review of the distributed software evolution. For this
purpose, the paper first addresses the importance of the distributed software
evolution, and then introduces its noteworthy paradigms.

coastal and ocean environment due to the scale of threats posed by climate
change and the limited resources to fill knowledge gaps. Using data from the
annotation activity of citizen scientists in a Swedish marine project, we
constructed Deep Neural Network models to predict forthcoming engagement. We
tested the models to identify patterns in annotation engagement. Based on the
results, it is possible to predict whether an annotator will remain active in
future sessions. Depending on the goals of individual citizen science projects,
it may also be necessary to identify either those volunteers who will leave or
those who will continue annotating. This can be predicted by varying the
threshold for the prediction. The engagement metrics used to construct the
models are based on time and activity and can be used to infer latent
characteristics of volunteers and predict their task interest based on their
activity patterns. They can estimate if volunteers can accomplish a given
number of tasks in a certain amount of time, identify early on who is likely to
become a top contributor or identify who is likely to quit and provide them
with targeted interventions. The novelty of our predictive models lies in the
use of Deep Neural Networks and the sequence of volunteer annotations. A
limitation of our models is that they do not use embeddings constructed from
user profiles as input data, as many recommender systems do. We expect that
including user profiles would improve prediction performance.

synthetic models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) using polarimetric imaging. Methods: Two SARS-CoV-2 models were
prepared as engineered lentiviruses pseudotyped with the G protein of the
vesicular stomatitis virus, and with the characteristic Spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2. Samples were preparations in two biofluids (saline solution and
artificial saliva), in four concentrations, and deposited as 5-{\mu}L droplets
on a supporting plate. The angles of maximal degree of linear polarization
(DLP) of light diffusely scattered from dry residues were determined using
Mueller polarimetry of 87 samples at 405 nm and 514 nm. A polarimetric camera
was used for simultaneous imaging of several samples under 380-420 nm
illumination at angles similar to those of maximal DLP. A per-pixel image
analysis included quantification and combination of polarization feature
descriptors in other 475 samples. Results: The angles (from sample surface) of
maximal DLP were 3 degrees for 405 nm and 6 degrees for 514 nm. Similar viral
particles that differ only in the characteristic spike protein of the
SARS-CoV-2, their corresponding negative controls, fluids, and the sample
holder were discerned from polarimetric image analysis at 10-degree and
15-degree configurations. Conclusion: Polarimetric imaging in the visible
spectrum has the potential for non-contact, reagent-free detection of viruses

chaotic Lagrangian structure, and also satisfies the Navier-Stokes (NS)
equations with an external force per unit mass. It is well-known that, although
trajectories of a chaotic system have sensitive dependence on initial
conditions, i.e. the famous ``butterfly-effect'', their statistical properties
are often insensitive to small disturbances. This kind of chaos (such as
governed by the Lorenz equations) is called normal-chaos. However, a new
concept, i.e. ultra-chaos, has been reported recently, whose statistics are
unstable to tiny disturbances. Thus, ultra-chaos represents higher disorder
than normal chaos. In this paper, we illustrate that ultra-chaos widely exists
in Lagrangian trajectories of fluid particles in steady-state ABC flow.
Moreover, solving the NS equation when $Re=50$ with the ABC flow plus a very
small disturbance as the initial condition, it is found that trajectories of
nearly all fluid particles become ultra-chaotic when the transition from
laminar to turbulence occurs. These numerical experiments and facts highly
suggest that ultra-chaos should have a relationship with turbulence. This paper
identifies differences between ultra-chaos and sensitivity of statistics to
parameters. Possible relationships between ultra-chaos and the Poincar\'{e}
section, ultra-chaos and ergodicity/non-ergodicity, etc., are discussed. The
concept of ultra-chaos opens a new perspective of chaos, the Poincar\'{e}
section, ergodicity/non-ergodicity, turbulence and their inter-relationships.

face videos, without any identity labels. Previous works employ cross-modal
instance discrimination tasks to establish the correlation of voice and face.
These methods neglect the semantic content of different videos, introducing
false-negative pairs as training noise. Furthermore, the positive pairs are
constructed based on the natural correlation between audio clips and visual
frames. However, this correlation might be weak or inaccurate in a large amount
of real-world data, which leads to deviating positives into the contrastive
paradigm. To address these issues, we propose the cross-modal prototype
contrastive learning (CMPC), which takes advantage of contrastive methods and
resists adverse effects of false negatives and deviate positives. On one hand,
CMPC could learn the intra-class invariance by constructing semantic-wise
positives via unsupervised clustering in different modalities. On the other
hand, by comparing the similarities of cross-modal instances from that of
cross-modal prototypes, we dynamically recalibrate the unlearnable instances'
contribution to overall loss. Experiments show that the proposed approach
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on various voice-face
association evaluation protocols. Additionally, in the low-shot supervision
setting, our method also has a significant improvement compared to previous
instance-wise contrastive learning.

  from canopy reflectance: theoretical basis and validation",,,,,"cs.CE eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Directional area scattering factor (DASF) is a critical canopy structural
parameter for vegetation monitoring. It provides an efficient tool for
decoupling of canopy structure and leaf optics from canopy reflectance. Current
standard approach to estimate DASF from canopy bidirectional reflectance factor
(BRF) is based on the assumption that in the weakly absorbing 710 to 790 nm
spectral interval, leaf scattering does not change much with the concentration
of dry matter and thus its variation can be neglected. This results in biased
estimates of DASF and consequently leads to uncertainty in DASF-related
applications. This study proposes a new approach to account for variations in
concentrations of this biochemical constituent, which additionally uses the
canopy BRF at 2260 nm. In silico analysis of the proposed approach suggests
significant increase in accuracy over the standard technique by a relative root
mean square error (rRMSE) of 49% and 34% for one- and three dimensional scenes,
respectively. When compared with indoor multi-angular hyperspectral
measurements reported in literature, the mean absolute error has reduced by 68%
for needle leaf and 20% for broadleaf canopies. Thus, the proposed DASF
estimation approach outperforms the current one and can be used more reliably
in DASF-related applications, such as vegetation monitoring of functional
traits, dynamics, and radiation budget.

multiple material and optoelectronic parameters with statistical confidence.
The methodology is applied to surface-guided CsPbBr$_3$ nanowires, which have
complex and interrelated geometric, structural and electronic properties.
Photoluminescence-based measurements, studying both the surface and embedded
interfaces, exploits the natural inter-nanowire geometric variation to show
that increasing the nanowire width reduces the optical bandgap, increases the
recombination rate in the nanowire bulk and reduces the rate at the surface
interface. A model of carrier recombination and diffusion is developed which
ascribes these trends to carrier density and strain effects at the interfaces
and self-consistently retrieves values for carrier mobility, trap densities,
bandgap, diffusion length and internal quantum efficiency. The model predicts
parameter trends, such as the variation of internal quantum efficiency with
width, which is confirmed by experimental verification. As this approach
requires minimal a-priori information, it is widely applicable to nano- and
micro-scale materials.

controlling prostheses and has been incorporated into occupational therapy for
individuals in need. In recent years, virtual reality (VR) and augmented

the convenience of rehabilitative prosthesis training systems. However, it is
uncertain if the comprehensive efficacy and effectiveness of VR or AR assistive
tools are adequate compared to conventional prosthetic tools and if not,
whether enhancements can be made through incorporation of other technical
paradigms.
  This work first presents a mixed reality system we developed for prosthesis
control and training. Five able-bodied subjects are involved to perform
three-dimensional object manipulation tasks in analogous AR and VR
environments. Multiple evaluation metrics are applied to assess subjects
performances within the two paradigms. Based on the comparative analysis, we
find that VR-based environment promotes more efficient motion along with higher
task completion rate and path efficiency while AR paradigm allows subjects to
perform motor tasks with shorter time consumed. Another study is conducted to
evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of AR-facilitated prosthesis control
system compared to that in real-world and if any technical additions can be
applied to improve the AR-based system. Three able-bodied subjects were engaged
in the experiment to perform object manipulation tasks in a) physical
environment, b) AR-without-bypass environment, and c) AR-with-bypass
environment. Based on the results obtained from the assessment, we conclude
that while our AR-based system modestly lags behind the effectiveness of
physical systems, the study conducted using a bypass prosthesis suggests that
AR system has the potential to improve the efficacy of prosthesis control.

produce generally useful, task-independent behaviors. One such universal
function, dubbed empowerment, measures the amount of control an agent exerts on
its environment via its sensorimotor system. Specifically, empowerment attempts
to maximize the mutual information between an agent's actions and its received
sensor states at a later point in time. Traditionally, empowerment has been
applied to a conventional sensorimotor apparatus, such as a robot. Here, we
expand the approach to a distributed, multi-agent sensorimotor system embodied
by a neural cellular automaton (NCA). We show that the addition of empowerment
as a secondary objective in the evolution of NCA to perform the task of
morphogenesis, growing and maintaining a pre-specified shape, results in higher
fitness compared to evolving for morphogenesis alone. Results suggest there may
be a synergistic relationship between morphogenesis and empowerment. That is,
indirectly selecting for coordination between neighboring cells over the
duration of development is beneficial to the developmental process itself. Such
a finding may have applications in developmental biology by providing potential
mechanisms of communication between cells during growth from a single cell to a

bifurcation, or change point detection. That is, given a collection of time
series over a varying parameter, when has the structure of the underlying
dynamical system changed? For this task, we turn to the field of topological
data analysis (TDA), which encodes information about the shape and structure of
data. The idea of utilizing tools from TDA for signal processing tasks, known
as topological signal processing (TSP), has gained much attention in recent
years, largely through a standard pipeline that computes the persistent
homology of the point cloud generated by the Takens' embedding. However, this
procedure is limited by computation time since the simplicial complex generated
in this case is large, but also has a great deal of redundant data. For this
reason, we turn to a more recent method for encoding the structure of the
attractor, which constructs an ordinal partition network (OPN) representing
information about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions
of state space. The result is a weighted graph whose structure encodes
information about the underlying attractor. Our previous work began to find
ways to package the information of the OPN in a manner that is amenable to TDA;
however, that work only used the network structure and did nothing to encode
the additional weighting information. In this paper, we take the next step:
building a pipeline to analyze the weighted OPN with TDA and showing that this
framework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system and
improves the accuracy of the dynamic state detection.

Service-Level Agreement (SLA) of customers while reducing operating costs. To
achieve this goal, CPs have built large-scale datacenters. This leads, however,
to underutilized resources and an increase in costs. A way to improve the
utilization of resources is to reclaim the unused parts and resell them at a
lower price. Providing SLA guarantees to customers on reclaimed resources is a
challenge due to their high volatility. Some state-of-the-art solutions
consider keeping a proportion of resources free to absorb sudden variation in
workloads. Others consider stable resources on top of the volatile ones to fill
in for the lost resources. However, these strategies either reduce the amount
of reclaimable resources or operate on less volatile ones such as Amazon Spot
instance. In this paper, we proposed RISCLESS, a Reinforcement Learning
strategy to exploit unused Cloud resources. Our approach consists of using a
small proportion of stable on-demand resources alongside the ephemeral ones in
order to guarantee customers SLA and reduce the overall costs. The approach
decides when and how much stable resources to allocate in order to fulfill
customers' demands. RISCLESS improved the CPs' profits by an average of 15.9%

regression (SR) problems. Compared with the machine learning or deep learning
methods that depend on the pre-defined model and the training dataset for
solving SR problems, GP is more focused on finding the solution in a search
space. Although GP has good performance on large-scale benchmarks, it randomly
transforms individuals to search results without taking advantage of the
characteristics of the dataset. So, the search process of GP is usually slow,
and the final results could be unstable.To guide GP by these characteristics,
we propose a new method for SR, called Taylor genetic programming (TaylorGP)
(Code and appendix at https://kgae-cup.github.io/TaylorGP/). TaylorGP leverages
a Taylor polynomial to approximate the symbolic equation that fits the dataset.
It also utilizes the Taylor polynomial to extract the features of the symbolic
equation: low order polynomial discrimination, variable separability, boundary,
monotonic, and parity. GP is enhanced by these Taylor polynomial techniques.
Experiments are conducted on three kinds of benchmarks: classical SR, machine
learning, and physics. The experimental results show that TaylorGP not only has
higher accuracy than the nine baseline methods, but also is faster in finding
stable results.

One such application is to use RFID to track inventory in warehouses and retail
stores. In this application, timely identifying the missing items is an ongoing
engineering problem. A feasible solution to this problem is to map each tag to
a time slot and verify the presence of a tag by comparing the status of the
predicted time slot and the actual time slot. However, existing works are time
inefficient because they only verify tags one by one in singleton slots but
ignore the collision slots mapped by multiple tags. To accelerate the
identification process, we use bit tracking to verify tags in collision slots
and design two protocols accordingly. We first propose the Sequential String
based Missing Tag Identification (SSMTI) protocol, which converts all time
slots to collision slots and enables tags in each slot to reply to a designed
string simultaneously. By using bit tracking to decode the combined string, the
reader can verify multiple tags together. To improve the performance of SSMTI
when most tags are missing, we further propose the Interactive String based
Missing Tag Identification (ISMTI) protocol. ISMTI improves the strategies of
designing strings for each collided tag so that the reader can verify more tags
using shorter strings than SSMTI.Besides, ISMTI can dynamically adjust the
verification mechanism according to the proportion of missing tags to maintain
time efficiency. We also provide theoretical analysis for proposed protocols to
minimize execution time and evaluate their performance through extensive
simulations. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed SSMTI and
ISMTI can reduce the time cost by as much as 39.74% and 68.87%.

transform robotics. One is already under way -- the miniaturization of robots,
to the point where invisible, microscopic robots could be around us and inside
us, performing monitoring or even life-saving functions. We have seen
systematic bio-inspired efforts to create microbe-like, microscopic robots. The
trend has parallels with miniaturization in the electronics industry, where
exponentially smaller and more energy efficient units have been produced each
generation. To put this statement in context, examples already include magnetic
microswimmer robots, employing bacterial modes of locomotion, which are
biocompatible, potentially ready for integration within our bodies. They
require lithography to create clever microscopic screw-type structures, enough
to produce the cork-screw swimming movement. Such micro-robots have
encapsulated, picked, and delivered cells, protecting them from shear forces in
fluids, while others have captured non-motile sperm, propelled them, and
