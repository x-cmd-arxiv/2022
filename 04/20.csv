increasingly popular tool to uncover novel compounds. However, traditional
methods tend to be limited to stability predictions of stoichiometric phases at
absolute zero. Such methods thus carry the risk of identifying an excess of
possible phases that do not survive to temperatures of practical relevance. We
demonstrate how the Calphad formalism, informed by simple first-principles
input can be simply used to overcome this problem at a low computational cost
and deliver quantitatively useful phase diagram predictions at all
temperatures. We illustrate the method by re-assessing prior compound formation
predictions and reconcile these findings with long-standing experimental
evidence to the contrary.

quantum engineering and quantum control, including the estimation of dynamical
parameters of open quantum systems monitored through the environment. However,
such measurements do not extract the maximum amount of information available in
the output state, so finding alternative optimal measurement strategies is a
major open problem.
  In this paper we solve this problem in the setting of discrete-time
input-output quantum Markov chains. We present an efficient algorithm for
optimal estimation of one-dimensional dynamical parameters which consists of an
iterative procedure for updating a `measurement filter' operator and
determining successive measurement bases for the output units. A key ingredient
of the scheme is the use of a coherent quantum absorber as a way to
post-process the output after the interaction with the system. This is designed
adaptively such that the joint system and absorber stationary state is pure at
a reference parameter value. The scheme offers an exciting prospect for optimal
continuous-time adaptive measurements, but more work is needed to find
realistic practical implementations.

sequence of decisions despite lacking complete information about the latent
states of the controlled system, that is, they act under partial observability
of the states, are ubiquitous. Partially observable RL can be notoriously
difficult -- well-known information-theoretic results show that learning
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires an exponential
number of samples in the worst case. Yet, this does not rule out the existence
of large subclasses of POMDPs over which learning is tractable.
  In this paper we identify such a subclass, which we call weakly revealing
POMDPs. This family rules out the pathological instances of POMDPs where
observations are uninformative to a degree that makes learning hard. We prove
that for weakly revealing POMDPs, a simple algorithm combining optimism and
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is sufficient to guarantee polynomial
sample complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably
sample-efficient result for learning from interactions in overcomplete POMDPs,
where the number of latent states can be larger than the number of

Warnke proved the approximate version of Erd\H{o}s' conjecture. Just this year,
Kwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin proved Erd\H{o}s' conjecture. As for Steiner
systems with more general parameters, Glock, K\""{u}hn, Lo, and Osthus
conjectured the existence of high girth $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems. We prove the
approximate version of their conjecture.
  This result follows from our general main results which concern finding
perfect or almost perfect matchings in a hypergraph $G$ avoiding a given set of
submatchings (which we view as a hypergraph $H$ where $V(H)=E(G)$). Our first
main result is a common generalization of the classical theorems of Pippenger
(for finding an almost perfect matching) and Ajtai, Koml\'os, Pintz, Spencer,
and Szemer\'edi (for finding an independent set in girth five hypergraphs).
More generally, we prove this for coloring and even list coloring, and also
generalize this further to when $H$ is a hypergraph with small codegrees (for
which high girth designs is a specific instance). Indeed, the coloring version
of our result even yields an almost partition of $K_n^r$ into approximate high
girth $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems.
  Our main results also imply the existence of a perfect matching in a
bipartite hypergraph where the parts have slightly unbalanced degrees. This has
a number of applications; for example, it proves the existence of $\Delta$
pairwise disjoint list colorings in the setting of Kahn's theorem; it also
proves asymptotic versions of various rainbow matching results in the sparse
setting (where the number of times a color appears could be much smaller than
the number of colors) and even the existence of many pairwise disjoint rainbow
matchings in such circumstances.

planet TOI-1710$\:$b. It was first identified as a promising candidate by the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Its planetary nature was then
established with SOPHIE and HARPS-N spectroscopic observations via the
radial-velocity method. The stellar parameters for the host star are derived
from the spectra and a joint Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) adjustment of the
spectral energy distribution and evolutionary tracks of TOI-1710. A joint MCMC
analysis of the TESS light curve and the radial-velocity evolution allows us to
determine the planetary system properties. From our analysis, TOI-1710$\:$b is
found to be a massive warm super-Neptune ($M_{\rm p}=28.3\:\pm\:4.7\:{\rm
M}_{\rm Earth}$ and $R_{\rm p}=5.34\:\pm\:0.11\:{\rm R}_{\rm Earth}$) orbiting
a G5V dwarf star ($T_{\rm eff}=5665\pm~55\mathrm{K}$) on a nearly circular
24.3-day orbit ($e=0.16\:\pm\:0.08$). The orbital period of this planet is
close to the estimated rotation period of its host star $P_{\rm
rot}=22.5\pm2.0~\mathrm{days}$ and it has a low Keplerian semi-amplitude
$K=6.4\pm1.0~\mathrm{m\:s^{-1}}$; we thus performed additional analyses to show
the robustness of the retrieved planetary parameters. With a low bulk density
of $1.03\pm0.23~\mathrm{g\:cm^{-3}}$ and orbiting a bright host star ($J=8.3$,
$V=9.6$), TOI-1710$\:$b is one of the best targets in this mass-radius range
(near the Neptunian desert) for atmospheric characterization via transmission
spectroscopy, a key measurement in constraining planet formation and
evolutionary models of sub-Jovian planets.

probability of choosing a derivation rule. Each individual uses its own grammar
to map the genotype into a program. During the evolutionary process, both the

exemplified by the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), provide a principled
approach for adapting the complexity of the model to the data. Such models are
particularly useful in clustering tasks where the number of clusters is
unknown. Despite their potential and mathematical elegance, however, DPMMs have
yet to become a mainstream tool widely adopted by practitioners. This is
arguably due to a misconception that these models scale poorly as well as the
lack of high-performance (and user-friendly) software tools that can handle
large datasets efficiently. In this paper we bridge this practical gap by
proposing a new, easy-to-use, statistical software package for scalable DPMM
inference. More concretely, we provide efficient and easily-modifiable
implementations for high-performance distributed sampling-based inference in
DPMMs where the user is free to choose between either a multiple-machine,
multiple-core, CPU implementation (written in Julia) and a multiple-stream GPU
implementation (written in CUDA/C++). Both the CPU and GPU implementations come
with a common (and optional) python wrapper, providing the user with a single
point of entry with the same interface. On the algorithmic side, our
implementations leverage a leading DPMM sampler from (Chang and Fisher III,
2013). While Chang and Fisher III's implementation (written in MATLAB/C++) used
only CPU and was designed for a single multi-core machine, the packages we
proposed here distribute the computations efficiently across either multiple
multi-core machines or across mutiple GPU streams. This leads to speedups,
alleviates memory and storage limitations, and lets us fit DPMMs to
significantly larger datasets and of higher dimensionality than was possible
previously by either (Chang and Fisher III, 2013) or other DPMM methods.

critical birth-death (CBD) process is widely used to model stem cell
populations, capturing key phenomena, such as scaling laws in clone size

we propose the birth-death process with volume exclusion (vBD), a variation of
the birth-death process that considers crowding effects, such as may arise due
to limited space in a stem cell niche. While the deterministic rate equations
predict a single non-trivial attracting steady state, the master equation
predicts extinction and transient distributions of stem cell numbers with three
possible behaviours: long-lived quasi-steady state, and short-lived bimodal or
unimodal distributions. In all cases, we approximate solutions to the vBD
master equation using a renormalised system-size expansion, quasi-steady state
approximation and the WKB method. Our study suggests that the size distribution
of a stem cell population bears signatures that are useful to detect negative

rotationally modulated flux imbalances and convective blueshift suppression, as
well as other observables such as unsigned magnetic flux. Comparing these
measurements with ground-based RVs from the NEID instrument, which observes the
Sun daily using an automated solar telescope, we find a strong relationship
between magnetic activity indicators and RV variation, supporting efforts to
examine unsigned magnetic flux as a proxy for stellar activity in slowly
rotating stars. Detrending against measured unsigned magnetic flux allows us to
improve the NEID RV measurements by ~20\% (~50 cm/s in a quadrature sum),
yielding an RMS scatter of ~60 cm/s over five months. We also explore
correlations between individual and averaged spectral line shapes in the NEID
spectra and SDO-derived magnetic activity indicators, motivating future studies

the ultimate failure of various materials, ranging from ductile metals to soft
and biological materials. Traditionally, cavitation in solids is defined as an
unstable expansion of a void or a defect within a material. The critical
applied load needed to trigger this instability - the critical pressure - is a
lengthscale independent material property and has been predicted by numerous
theoretical studies for a breadth of constitutive models. While these studies
usually assume that cavitation initiates from defects in the bulk of an
otherwise homogeneous medium, an alternative and potentially more ubiquitous
scenario can occur if the defects are found at interfaces between two distinct
media within the body. Such interfaces are becoming increasingly common in
modern materials with the use of multi-material composites and layer-by-layer
additive manufacturing methods. However, a criterion to determine the threshold
for interfacial failure, in analogy to the bulk cavitation limit, has yet to be
reported. In this work we fill this gap. Our theoretical model captures a
lengthscale independent limit for interfacial cavitation, and is shown to agree
with our observations at two distinct lengthscales, via two different
experimental systems. To further understand the competition between the two
cavitation modes (bulk versus interface) we expand our investigation beyond the
elastic response to understand the ensuing unstable propagation of delamination
at the interface. A phase diagram summarizes these results, showing regimes in
which interfacial failure becomes the dominant mechanism.

turbulent flows. Yet, a precise mechanistic description of this transfer, which
is expected to occur via an energy cascade, is still missing. Several
conceptually simple configurations with vortex tubes have been proposed as a
testing ground to understand the energy cascade. Here, we focus on
incompressible flows and compare the energy transfer occurring in a
statistically steady homogeneous isotropic turbulent (HIT) flow with the
generation of fine-scale motions in configurations involving vortex tubes. We
start by filtering the velocity field in bands of wavenumbers distributed
logarithmically, which allows us to study energy transfer in Fourier space and
also visualize the energy cascade in real space. In the case of a statistically
steady HIT flow at a moderate Reynolds number, our numerical results do not
reveal any significant correlation between regions of intense energy transfers
and vorticity or strain, filtered in corresponding wavenumber bands, nor any
simple self-similar process. In comparison, in the transient turbulent flow
obtained from the interaction between two antiparallel vortex tubes, we observe
a qualitatively simpler organization of the intense structures, as well as of
the energy transfer. The process leading to vortex reconnection via flattening
of interacting vortex cores in two intense ribbons of vorticity, also appears
as qualitatively different from the physics of HIT. Our results indicate that
the specific properties of the transient flows affect the way energy is
transferred, and may not be representative of HIT.

that there exists a significant part of the parameter space in the extended

lies at the heart of their technological applications. Although domain wall
motion in ferro- and antiferromagnets has been studied, in spiral magnets it is
still poorly understood despite 20 years of active research since the discovery
of spiral multiferroics. The problem of the domain wall motion in a spiral
magnet is a compelling one, the more so the magnetic domain walls in cycloidal
spiral phase are also ferroelectric, thus enabling electric control of
magnetism, i.e. domain wall motion under the action of an external electric
field. Phase transition to a spiral phase leads to a formation of chiral
domains with opposite spin rotation senses, that are separated by chiral domain
walls. Spiral order breaks inversion symmetry and induces a ferroelectric
polarization, whose sign is determined by the chirality of the domain. Thus the
spiral order allows for the manipulation of spins via an external electric
field. Here we study domain wall motion in magnets with spiral ground state,
that are the most basic non-collinear magnets. We formulate a simplified
variational model and derive the equation of motion for the domain wall driven
by an external electric field. The results are corroborated with atomistic spin
dynamics simulations. The results suggest a linear dependence of the wall speed
on the external electric field, and a peculiar dependence on the system
geometry and domain structure.

transformations by systematically exploring small circuits and verifies the
discovered transformations using an automated theorem prover. To optimize a
quantum circuit, Quartz uses a cost-based backtracking search that applies the
verified transformations to the circuit. Our evaluation on three popular gate
sets shows that Quartz can effectively generate and verify transformations for
different gate sets. The generated transformations cover manually designed
transformations used by existing optimizers and also include new
transformations. Quartz is therefore able to optimize a broad range of circuits
for diverse gate sets, outperforming or matching the performance of hand-tuned

  In this paper, we show a way to get around this limitation. Specifically, we
show that if we have a ``nice'' (for example, straight-line) embedding of the
input graph, all the mentioned problems can be solved with
$O(n^{2/3+\epsilon})$ space per machine in $O(1)$ rounds. In conjunction with
existing algorithms for computing the Delaunay triangulation, our results imply
an MPC algorithm for exact Euclidean minimum spanning thee (EMST) that uses
$O(n^{2/3 + \epsilon})$ space per machine and finishes in $O(1)$ rounds. This
is the first improvement over a straightforward use of the standard

Stark's perspective arose in his attempts to generalize the classical Dirichlet
class number formula for the leading term of the Dedekind zeta function at
$s=1$ (equivalently, $s=0$). Brumer's perspective arose by generalizing
Stickelberger's work regarding the factorization of Gauss sums and the
annihilation of class groups of cyclotomic fields. These viewpoints were
synthesized by Tate, who stated the Brumer-Stark conjecture in its current
form.
  The conjecture considers a totally real field $F$ and a finite abelian CM
extension $H/F$. It states the existence of $p$-units in $H$ whose valuations
at places above $p$ are related to the special values of the $L$-functions of
the extension $H/F$ at $s=0$. Essentially equivalently, the conjecture states
that a Stickelberger element associated to $H/F$ annihilates the (appropriately
smoothed) class group of $H$. This conjecture has been refined by many authors
in multiple directions.
  We conclude by stating our results toward these various conjectures and
summarizing the proofs. In particular, we prove the Brumer-Stark conjecture,
Rubin's higher rank version, and Kurihara's conjecture, all ""away from 2."" We
also prove strong partial results toward Gross's conjecture and the exact
$p$-adic analytic formula for Brumer-Stark units. The key technique involved in
the proofs is Ribet's method. We demonstrate congruences between Hilbert
modular Eisenstein series and cusp forms, and use the associated Galois
representations to construct Galois cohomology classes. These cohomology
classes are interpreted in terms of Ritter-Weiss modules, from which results on
class groups may be deduced.

optimization-based sampling algorithm that has recently exploded in popularity,

be slow to converge on complicated distributions. A recently proposed
stochastic variant of SVGD (sSVGD) addresses the first issue, producing
unbiased samples by incorporating a special noise into the SVGD dynamics such
that asymptotic convergence is guaranteed. Meanwhile, Stein variational Newton
(SVN), a Newton-like extension of SVGD, dramatically accelerates the
convergence of SVGD by incorporating Hessian information into the dynamics, but
also produces biased samples. In this paper we derive, and provide a practical
implementation of, a stochastic variant of SVN (sSVN) which is both
asymptotically correct and converges rapidly. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm on a difficult class of test problems -- the Hybrid Rosenbrock
density -- and show that sSVN converges using three orders of magnitude fewer
gradient evaluations of the log likelihood than its stochastic SVGD

foundation model is performed. Despite using only the target sequence

generative model, micromolar-level inhibition was observed in in vitro
experiments for two candidates out of only four synthesized for each target.
The most potent spike RBD inhibitor also exhibited activity against several

that a single, broadly deployable generative foundation model for accelerated

combined with the importance of the place category to annotate the visited

galaxies with higher $\Delta$[Fe/H] formed at higher redshifts -- exploiting
this, we infer the disrupted dwarfs have typical star-formation truncation
redshifts of $z_{\rm{trunc}}{\sim}1-2$. We compare the chemically inferred
$z_{\rm{trunc}}$ with dynamically inferred accretion redshifts and find almost
all dwarfs are quenched only after accretion. The differences between disrupted
and surviving dwarfs are likely because the disrupted dwarfs assembled their
mass rapidly, at higher redshifts, and within denser dark matter halos that
formed closer to the Galaxy. Our results place novel archaeological constraints
on low-mass galaxies inaccessible to direct high-$z$ studies: (i) the redshift
evolution of the MZR along parallel tracks but offset to lower metallicities
extends to $M_{\star}\approx10^{6}-10^{9}M_{\odot}$; (ii) galaxies at
$z\approx2-3$ are $\alpha$-enhanced with [$\alpha$/Fe]$\approx0.4$.

of different measurements including multiple oscillation channels and neutrino

previous measurements of coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CEvNS)

disfavor these scenarios for mediators lighter than $M_{Z'}\sim3$ MeV. Here we
leverage new data from the Dresden-II experiment which provides the strongest

completely removes the degeneracies in the $\nu_e$ sector for mediators down to
the MeV scale at which point constraints from the early universe take over.
While the LMA-Dark degeneracy is lifted in the $\nu_e$ sector, it can still be
restored in the $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ sector or with very specific couplings
to up and down quarks, and we speculate on a path forward.

insight about the engine behind core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and the fate of
the stellar collapse of massive stars. In particular, this insight is crucial
in developing an understanding of the origin and formation channels of detected
population of BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS mergers. To gain this understanding, we
must tie our current knowledge of pre-SN stars properties and their potential
explosions to the final NS or BH mass distribution. The timescale of convection
growth may have a large effect on the strength of SN explosion and therefore
also on the mass distribution of stellar remnants. In this study we adopt the
new formulas for the relation between the pre-SN star properties and its
remnant from Fryer et al. 2022 into StarTrack population synthesis code and
check how they impact double compact object (DCO) mergers formed via isolated
binary evolution. The new formulas give one ability to test a wide spectrum of
assumptions on the convection growth time. In particular, different variants
allow for a smooth transition between having a deep lower mass gap and a
remnant mass distribution filled by massive NSs and low mass BHs. In this paper
we present distribution of masses, mass ratios and the local merger rate
densities of DCO mergers for different variants of new remnant mass formulas.
We test them together with different approaches to other highly uncertain
processes. We find that mass distribution of DCO mergers up to m_1+m_2 < 35
Msun is sensitive to adopted assumption on SN convection growth timescale.
Between the two extreme tested variants the probability of compact object
formation within the lower mass gap may differ up to 2 orders of magnitude. The
mass ratio distribution of DCO mergers is significantly influenced by SN model
only for our standard mass transfer stability criteria.

both schools of thought, and following work by Takei and collaborators, we find
complete, two-parameter connection formulae for solutions when they cross
arbitrary Stokes lines in the complex plane. These formulae allow us to study
Stokes phenomenon for the full two-parameter family of transseries solutions.
In particular, we recover the exact expressions for the Stokes data that were

the presence of IMF variations in clusters. IMF Variations for a population of
clusters are taken into account in the form of Gaussian distributions of the
IMF parameters. For the tapered power law function used here, these are the
slopes at the high and low mass ends, $\Gamma$ and $\gamma$, and the
characteristic mass $M_{ch}$. Variations are modeled by varying the width of
the Gaussian distributions. The reference values are the standard deviations of
the parameters observed for young clusters in the present-day Milky Way
$\sigma_{\Gamma}=0.6$, $\sigma_{\gamma}=0.25$, and $\sigma_{M_{ch}}=0.27$
M$_{\odot}$. Increasing the dispersions of $\gamma$ and $\Gamma$ moderately
flattens the IGIMF at the low and high mass ends. Increasing $\sigma_{M_{ch}}$
shifts the peak of the IGIMF to lower masses, rendering the IGIMF more bottom
heavy. This can explain the bottom heavy stellar mass function of Early-type
galaxies as they are the result of the merger of disk galaxies where the
physical conditions of the star forming gas vary significantly both in time and
space. The effect of IMF variations is compared to that due to other effects
such as variations in the shape of the initial cluster mass function,
metallicity, and galactic SFR. We find that the effect of IMF variations is a
dominant factor that always affects the characteristic mass of the IGIMF. We
compare our results to a sample of ultra-faint dwarf satellite galaxies (UFDs).
Their present-day stellar mass function is an analog to their IGIMF at the time
their stellar populations have formed. We show that the slope of the IGIMF of
the UFDs can only be reproduced when IMF variations of the same order as those
measured in the present-day Milky Way are included. (Abridged)

the analysis of numerical hydrodynamical simulations in the LCDM cosmology. We
quantify the impact of the numerical resolution and AGN feedback scheme adopted
in cosmological simulations on the predicted GGSL probability and determine if
varying these simulation properties can alleviate the gap with observations. We
repeat the analysis of Meneghetti et al. (2020) on cluster-size halos simulated
with different mass and force resolutions and implementing several independent
AGN feedback schemes. We find that improving the mass resolution by a factor of
ten and twenty-five, while using the same galaxy formation model that includes
AGN feedback, does not affect the GGSL probability. We find similar results
regarding the choice of gravitational softening. On the contrary, adopting an
AGN feedback scheme that is less efficient at suppressing gas cooling and star
formation leads to an increase in the GGSL probability by a factor between
three and six. However, we notice that such simulations form overly massive
subhalos whose contribution to the lensing cross-section would be significant
while their Einstein radii are too large to be consistent with the
observations. The primary contributors to the observed GGSL cross-sections are
subhalos with smaller masses, that are compact enough to become critical for
lensing. The population with these required characteristics appears to be
absent in simulations.

re-simulations of a sub-sample of the cluster-sized haloes studied in
Meneghetti et al. (2020), obtained by varying mass resolution, softening length
and AGN energy feedback scheme. We study the impact of these different setups
on the subhalo abundances, their radial distribution, their density and mass
profiles and the relation between the maximum circular velocity, which is a
proxy for subhalo compactness. Regardless of the adopted numerical resolution
and feedback model, subhaloes with masses Msub < 1e11Msun/h, the most relevant
mass-range for galaxy-galaxy strong lensing, have maximum circular velocities
~30% smaller than those measured from strong lensing observations of Bergamini
et al. (2019). We also find that simulations with less effective AGN energy
feedback produce massive subhaloes (Msub> 1e11 Msun/h ) with higher maximum
circular velocity and that their Vmax - Msub relation approaches the observed
one. However the stellar-mass number count of these objects exceeds the one
found in observations and we find that the compactness of these simulated
subhaloes is the result of an extremely over-efficient star formation in their
cores, also leading to larger-than-observed subhalo stellar mass. We conclude
that simulations are unable to simultaneously reproduce the observed stellar
masses and compactness (or maximum circular velocities) of cluster galaxies.
Thus, the discrepancy between theory and observations that emerged from the
analysis of Meneghetti et al. (2020) persists. It remains an open question as
to whether such a discrepancy reflects limitations of the current
implementation of galaxy formation models or the LCDM paradigm.

medium, yet its transport is difficult to solve numerically. We present a novel
approach towards solving radiative transfer of diffuse sources via backwards
ray tracing. Here we focus on the radiative transfer of infrared radiation and
the radiation pressure on dust. The new module, \textsc{TreeRay/RadPressure},
is an extension to the novel radiative transfer method \textsc{TreeRay}
implemented in the grid-based MHD code {\sc Flash}. In
\textsc{TreeRay/RadPressure}, every cell and every star particle is a source of
infrared radiation. We also describe how gas, dust and radiation are coupled
via a chemical network. This allows us to compute the local dust temperature in
thermal equilibrium, leading to a significantly improvement over the classical
grey approximation. In several tests, we demonstrate that the scheme produces
the correct radiative intensities as well as the correct momentum input by
radiation pressure. Subsequently, we apply our new scheme to model massive star
formation from a collapsing, turbulent core of 150 ${\rm M}_\odot$. We include
the effects of both, ionizing and infrared radiation on the dynamics of the
core. We find that the newborn massive star prevents fragmentation in its
proximity due to radiative heating. Over time, dust and radiation temperature
equalize, while the gas temperature can be either warmer due to shock heating
or colder due to insufficient dust-gas coupling. Compared to gravity, the
effects of radiation pressure are insignificant for the stellar mass on the
simulated time scale in this work.

embedded planets carving gaps or creating vortices. The inferred masses of
these planets often fall in the Jovian regime despite their low abundance
compared to lower-mass planets, partly because previous works often assume that
a single substructure (a gap or vortex) is caused by a single planet. In this
work, we study the possible imprints of compact systems composed of
Neptune-like planets ($\sim10-30\;M_\oplus$) and show that long-standing
vortices are a prevalent outcome when their inter-planetary separation ($\Delta
a$) falls below $\sim8$ times $H_{{\rm p}}$ -- the average disk's scale height
at the planets locations. In simulations where a single planet is unable to
produce long-lived vortices, two-planet systems can preserve them for at least
$5,000$ orbits in two regimes: i) fully-shared density gaps with elongated
vortices around the stable Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ for the most compact
planet pairs ($\Delta a \lesssim 4.6\; H_{{\rm p}}$); ii) partially-shared gaps
for more widely spaced planets ($\Delta a \sim 4.6 - 8\;H_{{\rm p}}$) forming
vortices in a density ring between the planets through the Rossby wave
instability. The latter case can produce vortices with a wide range of aspect
ratios down to $\sim3$ and can occur for planets captured into the 3:2 (2:1)
mean-motion resonances for disk's aspects ratios of $h\gtrsim 0.033$ ($h\gtrsim
0.057$). We suggest that their long lifetimes are sustained by the interaction
of spiral density waves launched by the neighboring planets. Overall, our
results show that distinguishing imprint of compact systems with Neptune-mass
planets are long-lived vortices inside the density gaps, which in turn are
shallower than single-planet gaps for a fixed gap width.

likelihood minus a penalty term based on the sample size $N$, is a popular
model selection criterion for factor analysis with complete data. This
definition has also been suggested for incomplete data. However, the penalty
term based on the `complete' sample size $N$ is the same no matter whether in a
complete or incomplete data case. For incomplete data, there are often only
$N_i<N$ observations for variable $i$, which means that using the `complete'
sample size $N$ implausibly ignores the amounts of missing information inherent
in incomplete data. Given this observation, a novel criterion called
hierarchical BIC (HBIC) for factor analysis with incomplete data is proposed.
The novelty is that it only uses the actual amounts of observed information,
namely $N_i$'s, in the penalty term. Theoretically, it is shown that HBIC is a
large sample approximation of variational Bayesian (VB) lower bound, and BIC is
a further approximation of HBIC, which means that HBIC shares the theoretical
consistency of BIC. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets are conducted
to access the finite sample performance of HBIC, BIC, and related criteria with
various missing rates. The results show that HBIC and BIC perform similarly
when the missing rate is small, but HBIC is more accurate when the missing rate
is not small.

design an incremental algorithm to decide whether a configuration of solar

The algorithm circumvents explicit risk computation by incrementally
constructing inner and outer polyhedral approximations of the set of acceptable

ultra-high energy cosmic rays can be efficiently accelerated by magnetic
reconnection in these sources. We here demonstrate this directly, with no
extrapolations to large scales, by means of three-dimensional relativistic
magnetohydrodynamical (3D-RMHD) simulations of a Poyinting flux dominated jet.
We inject thousands of low-energy protons in the region of a relativistic jet
that corresponds to the transition from magnetically to kinetically dominated,
where its magnetization parameter is $\sigma \sim 1$. In this region, there is
efficient fast magnetic reconnection which is naturally driven by
current-driven-kink instability (CDKI) turbulence in the helical magnetic
fields of the jet. We find that the particles are accelerated by Fermi process
in the reconnection regions (and by drift in the final stages) up to energies
$E \sim 10^{18}$ eV for background magnetic fields $B \sim 0.1$ G, and $E \sim
10^{20}$ eV for $B \sim 10$ G. We have also derived from the simulations the
acceleration rate due to magnetic reconnection which has a weak dependence on
the particles energy $ r_{acc} \propto E^{-0.1}$, characteristic of exponential
growth. The energy spectrum of the accelerated particles develops a power-law
tail with spectral index $p \sim -1.2$. This hardness of the spectrum must
decrease when particle losses and feedback into the background plasma are
included. Our results can explain observed flux variability in the emission of
blazars at the very high energy band as well as the associated neutrino
emission. Successful applications of our results to the blazars MRK 421 and TXS

observations is the magnonic angular momentum transfer to the DW. The hard
(shape) anisotropy exists in biaxial nanowire, which contributes an additional
torque, hence DW speed is larger than that in uniaxial nanowire. With lower
damping, the DW velocity is smaller and DW velocity increases with damping
which is opposite to usual expectation. To explain this, it is predicted that
there is a probability to form the standing spin-waves (which do not carry net
energy/momentum) together with travelling spin-waves if the propagation length
of thermally-generated spin-waves is larger than the nanowire length. For
larger-damping, DW decreases with damping since the magnon propagation length
decreases. Therefore, the above findings might be useful in realizing the

In the intelligent vehicle context, automated driving commentary can provide
intelligible explanations about driving actions, thereby assisting a driver or
an end-user during driving operations in challenging and safety-critical
scenarios. In this paper, we conducted a field study in which we deployed a
research vehicle in an urban environment to obtain data. While collecting
sensor data of the vehicle's surroundings, we obtained driving commentary from
a driving instructor using the think-aloud protocol. We analysed the driving
commentary and uncovered an explanation style; the driver first announces his
observations, announces his plans, and then makes general remarks. He also
makes counterfactual comments. We successfully demonstrated how factual and
counterfactual natural language explanations that follow this style could be
automatically generated using a transparent tree-based approach. Generated
explanations for longitudinal actions (e.g., stop and move) were deemed more
intelligible and plausible by human judges compared to lateral actions, such as
lane changes. We discussed how our approach can be built on in the future to

prohibitively difficult due to a lack of high-quality data. But, recent
advances in speech-to-text algorithms and natural language processing has made
it possible to more easily collect and analyze data about municipal
governments. In this paper, we introduce an open-source platform, the Council
Data Project (CDP), to curate novel datasets for research into municipal
governance. The contribution of this work is two-fold: 1. We demonstrate that
CDP, as an infrastructure, can be used to assemble reliable comparative data on
municipal governance; 2. We provide exploratory analysis of three
municipalities to show how CDP data can be used to gain insight into how
municipal governments perform over time. We conclude by describing future
directions for research on and with CDP such as the development of machine
learning models for speaker annotation, outline generation, and named entity
recognition for improved linked data.

Model Predictive Control (MPC). The method starts from understanding
interaction from an Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) perspective. We assume that
users aim to minimize an internalized cost function, subject to the constraints
imposed by the human body and the interactive system. In contrast to previous
linear approaches used in HCI, MPC can compute optimal controls for nonlinear
systems. This allows us to use state-of-the-art biomechanical models and handle
nonlinearities that occur in almost any interactive system. Instead of torque
actuation, our model employs second-order muscles acting directly at the
joints. We compare three different cost functions and evaluate the simulated
trajectories against user movements in a Fitts' Law type pointing study with
four different interaction techniques. Our results show that the combination of
distance, control, and joint acceleration cost matches individual users'
movements best, and predicts movements with an accuracy that is within the
between-user variance. To aid HCI researchers and designers, we introduce CFAT,
a novel method to identify maximum voluntary torques in joint-actuated models
based on experimental data, and give practical advice on how to simulate human
movement for different users, interaction techniques, and tasks.

to using explicit second-order information by taking identical inputs to those
used by popular first-order methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Solving the CR subproblem exactly requires Newton's method, yet using
properties of the internal structure of LQN matrices, we are able to find exact
solutions to the CR subproblem in a matrix-free manner, providing large
speedups and scaling into modern size requirements. Additionally, we expand
upon previous ARC work and explicitly incorporate first-order updates into our
algorithm. We provide experimental results when the SR1 update is used, which
show substantial speed-ups and competitive performance compared to Adam and
other second order optimizers on deep neural networks (DNNs). We find that our

patterns in terms of when, where, and how people move from one place to

large-scale investment decisions on the nation's multi-modal transportation
infrastructure. Recent rise of using passively generated mobile data from
mobile devices have raised questions on using such data for capturing the
mobility patterns of a population because: 1) there is a great variety of
different kinds of mobile data and their respective properties are unknown; and
2) data pre-processing and analysis methods are often not explicitly reported.
The high stakes involved with mobility analysis and issues associated with the
passively generated mobile data call for mobility analysis (including data,
methods and results) to be accessible to all, interoperable across different
computing systems, reproducible and reusable by others. In this study, a
container system named Mobility Analysis Workflow (MAW) that integrates data,
methods and results, is developed. Built upon the containerization technology,
MAW allows its users to easily create, configure, modify, execute and share
their methods and results in the form of Docker containers. Tools for
operationalizing MAW are also developed and made publicly available on GitHub.
One use case of MAW is the comparative analysis for the impacts of different
pre-processing and mobility analysis methods on inferred mobility patterns.
This study finds that different pre-processing and analysis methods do have
impacts on the resulting mobility patterns. The creation of MAW and a better
understanding of the relationship between data, methods and resulting mobility
patterns as facilitated by MAW represent an important first step toward
promoting reproducibility and reusability in mobility analysis with
passively-generated data.

errors to be scaled into useful quantum machines. An emerging strategy is to
encode quantum information in the two meta-stable pointer states of an

to provide stability without inducing decoherence. Adding photons in these
states increases their separation, and macroscopic bit-flip times are expected
even for a handful of photons, a range suitable to implement a qubit. However,
previous experimental realizations have saturated in the millisecond range. In
this work, we aim for the maximum bit-flip time we could achieve in a
two-photon dissipative oscillator. To this end, we design a Josephson circuit
in a regime that circumvents all suspected dynamical instabilities, and employ
a minimally invasive fluorescence detection tool, at the cost of a two-photon
exchange rate dominated by single-photon loss. We attain bit-flip times of the
order of 100 seconds for states pinned by two-photon dissipation and containing
about 40 photons. This experiment lays a solid foundation from which the
two-photon exchange rate can be gradually increased, thus gaining access to the

  Time Series -- Full Version","18 pages",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The wide deployment of IoT sensors has enabled the collection of very big
time series across different domains, from which advanced analytics can be
performed to find unknown relationships, most importantly the correlations
between them. However, current approaches for correlation search on time series
are limited to only a single temporal scale and simple types of relations, and
cannot handle noise effectively. This paper presents the integrated SYnchronous
COrrelation Search (iSYCOS) framework to find multi-scale correlations in big
time series. Specifically, iSYCOS integrates top-down and bottom-up approaches
into a single auto-configured framework capable of efficiently extracting
complex window-based correlations from big time series using mutual information
(MI). Moreover, iSYCOS includes a novel MI-based theory to identify noise in
the data, and is used to perform pruning to improve iSYCOS performance.
Besides, we design a distributed version of iSYCOS that can scale out in a
Spark cluster to handle big time series. Our extensive experimental evaluation
on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that iSYCOS can auto-configure on a
given dataset to find complex multi-scale correlations. The pruning and
optimisations can improve iSYCOS performance up to an order of magnitude, and
the distributed iSYCOS can scale out linearly on a computing cluster.

large-scale structure (LSS) tensions. This additional friction acts on a scalar
field in the early universe and extracts its energy density into dark
radiation, the cumulative effect being similar to that of an early dark energy
(EDE) scenario. The dark radiation automatically redshifts at the minimal
necessary rate to improve the Hubble tension. On the other hand, the addition
of extra radiation to the Universe can improve the LSS tension. We explore this
model in light of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic
oscillation and supernova data, including the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement and the
Dark Energy Survey Y1 data release in our analysis. Our results indicate a
preference for the regime where the scalar field converts to dark radiation at
very high redshifts, asymptoting effectively to an extra self-interacting
radiation species rather than an EDE-like injection. In this limit, thermal
friction can ease both the Hubble and the LSS tensions, but not resolve them.
We find the source of this preference to be the incompatibility of the CMB data
with the linear density perturbations of the dark radiation when injected at
redshifts close to matter-radiation equality.

a route to estimating peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies. Given a galaxy
with a known spectroscopic redshift one can use the NN-predicted distance to
make an estimate of the peculiar velocity. Trying this using relatively low

in a large sample of quasar lightcurves, a significant contribution from
microlensing is required. This implies the existence of a cosmologically
distributed population of stellar mass compact bodies making up a large
fraction of the dark matter. Our analysis is based on the lightcurves of a
sample of over 1000 quasars, photometrically monitored over a period of 26
years. The intrinsic variations in quasar luminosity are derived from luminous
quasars where the quasar accretion disc is too large to be microlensed by
stellar mass bodies, and then synthetic lightcurves for the whole sample are
constructed with the same statistical properties. We then run microlensing
simulations for each quasar with convergence in compact bodies appropriate to
the quasar redshift assuming a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The synthetic lightcurve
is then superimposed on the amplification pattern to incorporate the effects of
microlensing. The distribution of the resulting amplitudes can then be compared
with observation, giving a very close match. This procedure does not involve
optimising parameters or fitting to the data, as all inputs such as lens mass
and quasar disc size come from independent observations in the literature. The
overall conclusion of the paper is that to account for the distribution of
quasar lightcurve amplitudes it is necessary to include the microlensing

in detail in the context of avian magnetoreception, the studies reviewed here
show that magnetosensitivity is widespread throughout biology. We review
magnetic field effects on various physiological functions, organizing them
based on the type of the applied magnetic fields, namely static, hypomagnetic,
and oscillating magnetic fields, as well as isotope effects. We then review the
radical pair mechanism as a potential unifying model for the described magnetic
field effects, and we discuss plausible candidate molecules that might
constitute the radical pairs. We review recent studies proposing that the
quantum nature of the radical pairs provides promising explanations for xenon
anesthesia, lithium effects on hyperactivity, magnetic field and lithium
effects on the circadian clock, and hypomagnetic field effects on neurogenesis
and microtubule assembly. We conclude by discussing future lines of
investigation in this exciting new area of quantum biology related to weak
magnetic field effects.

deciding whether a given string matches a regular expression (viewed as an
instruction) to identify properties of tasks, instructions, and instances that
make instruction learning challenging. For instance, we find that our model, a
fine-tuned T5-based text2text transformer, struggles with large regular
languages, suggesting that less precise instructions are challenging for
models. Additionally, instruction executions that require tracking longer
contexts of prior steps are also more difficult. We use our findings to
systematically construct a challenging instruction learning dataset, which we

imperfections. Consequently, the inferencing accuracy in an SPNN can be highly
impacted by FPVs -- e.g., can drop to below 10% -- the impact of which is yet

the impact of FPVs in the waveguide width and silicon-on-insulator (SOI)

potential to replace these bulky imaging systems and, moreover, they may be

derive a fundamental bound on the spectral bandwidth of dispersion-engineered
wide-FOV achromatic metalenses. We show that for metalenses with a relatively
large numerical aperture (NA), there is a tradeoff between the maximum

impossible to implement when a dataset is very large. In this paper we address
the problem of finding a representative persistence diagram for prohibitively

taken as a mean persistence measure computed from the subsamples -- is a valid
approximation of the true persistent homology of the larger dataset. We give
the rate of convergence of the mean persistence diagram to the true persistence

the complex algebraic and geometric nature of persistent homology, we adapt the
convexity and stability properties in the space of persistence diagrams

problem we found most troubling to our community is that researchers tend to
oversimplify the description of the ground truth they use. For example, a
common expression is that ""we studied the correlation between real faults and
the metric to evaluate (MTE)"". However, the meaning of ""real faults"" is not
clear-cut. As a result, there is a need to scrutinize the meaning of ""real
faults"". Without this, it will be half-knowledgeable with the conclusions. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a framework ASSENT (evAluating teSt Suite
EffectiveNess meTrics) to guide the follow-up research. In nature, ASSENT
consists of three fundamental components: ground truth, benchmark test suites,
and agreement indicator. First, materialize the ground truth for determining
the real order in effectiveness among test suites. Second, generate a set of
benchmark test suites and derive their ground truth order in effectiveness.
Third, for the benchmark test suites, generate the MTE order in effectiveness
by the metric to evaluate (MTE). Finally, calculate the agreement indicator
between the two orders. Under ASSENT, we are able to compare the accuracy of
different test suite effectiveness metrics. We apply ASSENT to evaluate
representative test suite effectiveness metrics, including mutation score
metrics and code coverage metrics. Our results show that, based on the real
faults, mutation score and subsuming mutation score are the best metrics to
quantify test suite effectiveness. Meanwhile, by using mutants instead of real
faults, MTEs will be overestimated by more than 20% in values.

quantitative performance evaluation of several action recognition models for
transcoded videos in different qualities. First, we show how the video quality
affects the performance of pre-trained models. We transcode the original
validation videos of Kinetics400 by changing quality control parameters of JPEG
(compression strength) and H.264/AVC (CRF). Then we use the transcoded videos
to validate the pre-trained models. Second, we show how the models perform when

transcoding show that there is no severe performance degradation (up to -1.5%)
for compression strength smaller than 70 where no quality degradation is
visually observed, and for larger than 80 the performance degrades linearly
with respect to the quality index. Experiments with H.264/AVC transcoding show

information-theoretic security guarantee. While differential privacy has
emerged as a de facto standard for guaranteeing privacy in data sharing, the
known mechanisms to achieve it come with some serious limitations. Utility
guarantees are usually provided only for a fixed, a priori specified set of
queries. Moreover, there are no utility guarantees for more complex - but very
common - machine learning tasks such as clustering or classification. In this
paper we overcome some of these limitations. Working with metric privacy, a
powerful generalization of differential privacy, we develop a polynomial-time
algorithm that creates a private measure from a data set. This private measure
allows us to efficiently construct private synthetic data that are accurate for
a wide range of statistical analysis tools. Moreover, we prove an
asymptotically sharp min-max result for private measures and synthetic data for
general compact metric spaces. A key ingredient in our construction is a new
superregular random walk, whose joint distribution of steps is as regular as
that of independent random variables, yet which deviates from the origin
logarithmicaly slowly.

$k$-partitioning problems -- namely, Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and
Minmax-Hypergraph-$k$-Partition. The input in hypergraph $k$-partitioning
problems is a hypergraph $G=(V, E)$ with positive hyperedge costs along with a
fixed positive integer $k$. The goal is to find a partition of $V$ into $k$
non-empty parts $(V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k)$ -- known as a $k$-partition -- so as
to minimize an objective of interest.
  1. If the objective of interest is the maximum cut value of the parts, then
the problem is known as Minmax-Hypergraph-$k$-Partition. A subset of hyperedges
is a minmax-$k$-cut-set if it is the subset of hyperedges crossing an optimum
$k$-partition for Minmax-Hypergraph-$k$-Partition.
  2. If the objective of interest is the total cost of hyperedges crossing the

hyperedges is a min-$k$-cut-set if it is the subset of hyperedges crossing an
optimum $k$-partition for Hypergraph-$k$-Cut.
  We give the first polynomial bound on the number of minmax-$k$-cut-sets and a
polynomial-time algorithm to enumerate all of them in hypergraphs for every
fixed $k$. Our technique is strong enough to also enable an $n^{O(k)}p$-time
deterministic algorithm to enumerate all min-$k$-cut-sets in hypergraphs, thus
improving on the previously known $n^{O(k^2)}p$-time deterministic algorithm,
where $n$ is the number of vertices and $p$ is the size of the hypergraph. The
correctness analysis of our enumeration approach relies on a structural result
that is a strong and unifying generalization of known structural results for
Hypergraph-$k$-Cut and Minmax-Hypergraph-$k$-Partition. We believe that our
structural result is likely to be of independent interest in the theory of
hypergraphs (and graphs).

{\eta}, thermal conductivity \k{appa} and electric conductivity {\sigma}
together. To be specific, the linear Mott relation describes the linear {\eta}
is proportional to the first derivative of {\sigma} with respect to Fermi
energy (for brevity we call the first derivative, the others are similar); and
the linear WF law shows the linear \k{appa} is proportional to the zero

rates of metals, mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. We find that, at most,

increases steeply and inversely with both circular and outflow velocity

  Completion","Accepted to IJCAI 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-world sensors often produce incomplete, irregular, and noisy point
clouds, making point cloud completion increasingly important. However, most
existing completion methods rely on large paired datasets for training, which
is labor-intensive. This paper proposes RaPD, a novel semi-supervised point
cloud completion method that reduces the need for paired datasets. RaPD
utilizes a two-stage training scheme, where a deep semantic prior is learned in
stage 1 from unpaired complete and incomplete point clouds, and a
semi-supervised prior distillation process is introduced in stage 2 to train a
completion network using only a small number of paired samples. Additionally, a
self-supervised completion module is introduced to improve performance using
unpaired incomplete point clouds. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
RaPD outperforms previous methods in both homologous and heterologous
scenarios.

model to investigate the ordinal responses. We integrate the standard ResLogit
model into COnsistent RAnk Logits (CORAL) framework, classified as a binary
classification algorithm, to develop a fully interpretable deep learning-based
ordinal regression model. As the formulation of the Ordinal-ResLogit model
enjoys the Residual Neural Networks concept, our proposed model addresses the
main constraint of machine learning algorithms, known as black-box. Moreover,
the Ordinal-ResLogit model, as a binary classification framework for ordinal
data, guarantees consistency among binary classifiers. We showed that the
resulting formulation is able to capture underlying unobserved heterogeneity
from the data as well as being an interpretable deep learning-based model.
Formulations for market share, substitution patterns, and elasticities are
derived. We compare the performance of the Ordinal-ResLogit model with an
Ordered Logit Model using a stated preference (SP) dataset on pedestrian wait
time and a revealed preference (RP) dataset on travel distance. Our results
show that Ordinal-ResLogit outperforms the traditional ordinal regression model
for both datasets. Furthermore, the results obtained from the Ordinal-ResLogit
RP model show that travel attributes such as driving and transit cost have
significant effects on choosing the location of non-mandatory trips. In terms
of the Ordinal-ResLogit SP model, our results highlight that the road-related
variables and traffic condition are contributing factors in the prediction of
pedestrian waiting time such that the mixed traffic condition significantly
increases the probability of choosing longer waiting times.

system-spanning state of self stress in under-constrained systems of individual
polygons and spring networks constructed from such polygons. When a polygon

expansive strain, we observe that convexity of the polygon is a necessary
condition for such a self stress. We prove that the cyclic configuration of the
polygon is a sufficient condition for the self stress. This correspondence of
geometry and rigidity is akin to the straightening of a one dimensional chain
of springs to rigidify it. We predict the onset of the rigidity transition
using a purely geometrical method. We also estimate the transition strain for a
given initial configuration by approximating irregular polygons as regular
polygons. These findings help determine the rigidity of an area-preserving
polygon just by looking at it. Since two-dimensional spring networks can be
considered as a network of polygons, we look for similar geometric features in
under-constrained spring networks under isotropic expansive strain. In
particular, we observe that all polygons attain convexity at the rigidity

the onset of the rigidity transition. Interestingly, acyclic polygons in the

symmetric polynomials. It expresses a Macdonald polynomial as a nonnegative
linear combination of Macdonald polynomials with smaller number of variables.
Taking a limit of the branching rule under the principal specialization when
the number of variables goes to infinity, we obtain a Markov chain of $m$
noncolliding particles with negative drift and an absorbing wall at zero. The
chain depends on the Macdonald parameters $(q,t)$ and may be viewed as a
discrete deformation of the Dyson Brownian motion. The trajectory of the Markov
chain is equivalent to a certain Gibbs ensemble of plane partitions with an
arbitrary cascade front wall. In the Jack limit $t=q^{\beta/2}\to 1$ the
absorbing wall disappears, and the Macdonald noncolliding walks turn into the
$\beta$-noncolliding random walks studied by Huang [Int. Math. Res. Not. 2021

it is found that the radiation of PSR B0950+08 could be detected over the
entire pulse period. To investigate the radiative characteristics of the
pulsar' ""bridge emission"", a function, $\Theta$(n), is defined to reveal the
weak radiation there. It is suggested that the narrow peaks of both the main

emission (e.g., the ""bridges"") from upper magnetosphere though its radiative
mechanism is still a matter of debate. The measured mean pulse behaviors are
consistent with previous results in the phase of strong emission of this
pulsar, and both the frequency-independent separation between the inter-pulse

order to understand the magnetospheric geometry of this pulsar, further
polarization calibrated observation with FAST and a proper determination of the
baseline emission, especially during the weak emission phase, are surely
required.

confinement fusion. To enhance implosion performance while keeping the risk of
hydrodynamic instability at a low level, we have designed a procedure to
optimize the parameters of the target doped with mid- or high-$Z$ atoms. In the
procedure, a one-dimensional implosion can be automatically simulated, while
its implosion performance and high-dimensional instability are integrally
evaluated at the same time. To find the optimal doping parameters, the
procedure is performed in the framework of global optimization algorithm, where
we have used the particle swarm optimization in the current work. In the
optimization, the opacity of mixture materials is quickly obtained by using an
interpolation method, showing only a slight difference from the data of TOPS,
which is an online doping program of Los Alamos National Laboratory. To test
the procedure, optimization has been carried out for the CH ablator in the
double cone ignition scheme [Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A. 378.2184 (2020)] by doping
with Si and Cl. Both one- and two-dimensional simulations show that doping with
either Si or Cl can efficiently mitigate the instability during the
acceleration phase and does not result in significant degradation of the peak
areal density. The results from one- and two-dimensional simulations
qualitatively match with each other, demonstrating the validity of our
optimization procedure.

neural network model into multiple target platforms by utilising the
supernet-subnet architecture. Once trained, a subnet can be derived from the
supernet (both architecture and trained weights) and deployed directly to the
target platform with little to no retraining or fine-tuning. To train the
subnet population, OFA uses a novel training method called Progressive
Shrinking (PS) which is designed to limit the negative impact of interference
during training. It is believed that higher interference during training
results in lower subnet population accuracies. In this work we take a second
look at this interference effect. Surprisingly, we find that interference
mitigation strategies do not have a large impact on the overall subnet
population performance. Instead, we find the subnet architecture selection bias
during training to be a more important aspect. To show this, we propose a
simple-yet-effective method called Random Subnet Sampling (RSS), which does not
have mitigation on the interference effect. Despite no mitigation, RSS is able
to produce a better performing subnet population than PS in four
small-to-medium-sized datasets; suggesting that the interference effect does
not play a pivotal role in these datasets. Due to its simplicity, RSS provides
a $1.9\times$ reduction in training times compared to PS. A $6.1\times$
reduction can also be achieved with a reasonable drop in performance when the
number of RSS training epochs are reduced. Code available at

heavy-ion collision by a fluid dynamic expansion coupled to the explicit
propagation of the chiral order parameter sigma via a Langevin equation. We
evolve the medium until a parametrized freeze-out condition is met where we
calculate event-by-event fluctuations and cumulants of sigma which are expected
to follow the trend of net-proton number cumulants. We emphasize the role of a
nonequilibrium first-order phase transition: The presence of an unstable phase
causes the well-known bending of the trajectories in the space of temperature
and baryochemical potential. For these cases at lower beam energies, the system
crosses the freeze-out line more than once, allowing us to calculate a range of
cumulants for each initial condition which are overall enhanced for the second
hit of the freeze-out line. We thus find not only the critical end point but
also the phase transition of the underlying model clearly reflected in the
cumulants. The impact of volume fluctuations is demonstrated to play a
measurable role for fluid dynamical evolutions that last significantly long.

network on a large-scale unannotated speech corpus, and then applying the
learned representations to downstream tasks. Since the majority of the
downstream tasks of SSL learning in speech largely focus on the content
information in speech, the most desirable speech representations should be able
to disentangle unwanted variations, such as speaker variations, from the
content. However, disentangling speakers is very challenging, because removing
the speaker information could easily result in a loss of content as well, and
the damage of the latter usually far outweighs the benefit of the former. In
this paper, we propose a new SSL method that can achieve speaker
disentanglement without severe loss of content. Our approach is adapted from
the HuBERT framework, and incorporates disentangling mechanisms to regularize
both the teacher labels and the learned representations. We evaluate the
benefit of speaker disentanglement on a set of content-related downstream
tasks, and observe a consistent and notable performance advantage of our
speaker-disentangled representations.

fundamental to gain system-level insights into the mechanisms of brain
organizational architecture. Current functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)
analysis highly relies on prior knowledge of specific patterns in either
spatial (e.g., resting-state network) or temporal (e.g., task stimulus) domain.
In addition, most approaches aim to find group-wise common functional networks,
individual-specific functional networks have been rarely studied. In this work,
we propose a novel Twin-Transformers framework to simultaneously infer common
and individual functional networks in both spatial and temporal space, in a
self-supervised manner. The first transformer takes space-divided information
as input and generates spatial features, while the second transformer takes
time-related information as input and outputs temporal features. The spatial
and temporal features are further separated into common and individual ones via
interactions (weights sharing) and constraints between the two transformers. We
applied our TwinTransformers to Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor task-fMRI
dataset and identified multiple common brain networks, including both
task-related and resting-state networks (e.g., default mode network).
Interestingly, we also successfully recovered a set of individual-specific
networks that are not related to task stimulus and only exist at the individual
level.

open. What is the last-iterate convergence rate of the extragradient algorithm

variation of network flows, which calls for accurate modeling and estimation of
probabilistic dynamic travel demand on networks. Most existing studies estimate
deterministic dynamic origin-destination (OD) demand, while the day-to-day
variation of demand and flow is overlooked. Estimating probabilistic
distributions of dynamic OD demand is challenging due to the complexity of the
spatio-temporal networks and the computational intensity of the
high-dimensional problems. With the availability of massive traffic data and
the emergence of advanced computational methods, this paper develops a
data-driven framework that solves the probabilistic dynamic origin-destination
demand estimation (PDODE) problem using multi-day data. Different statistical
distances (e.g., lp-norm, Wasserstein distance, KL divergence, Bhattacharyya
distance) are used and compared to measure the gap between the estimated and
the observed traffic conditions, and it is found that 2-Wasserstein distance
achieves a balanced accuracy in estimating both mean and standard deviation.
The proposed framework is cast into the computational graph and a
reparametrization trick is developed to estimate the mean and standard
deviation of the probabilistic dynamic OD demand simultaneously. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PDODE framework on both small
and real-world networks. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed
PDODE framework can mitigate the overfitting issues by considering the demand
variation. Overall, the developed PDODE framework provides a practical tool for
public agencies to understand the sources of demand stochasticity, evaluate
day-to-day variation of network flow, and make reliable decisions for
intelligent transportation systems.

detection of oil slicks on the ocean surface. In SAR images, some areas
affected by ocean phenomena, such as rain cells, upwellings, and internal
waves, or discharge from oil spills appear as dark spots on images. Dark spot
detection is the first step in the detection of oil spills, which then become
oil slick candidates. The accuracy of dark spot segmentation ultimately affects
the accuracy of oil slick identification. Although some advanced deep learning
methods that use pixels as processing units perform well in remote sensing
image semantic segmentation, detecting some dark spots with weak boundaries
from noisy SAR images remains a huge challenge. We propose a dark spot
detection method based on superpixels deeper graph convolutional networks
(SGDCN) in this paper, which takes the superpixels as the processing units and
extracts features for each superpixel. The features calculated from superpixel
regions are more robust than those from fixed pixel neighborhoods. To reduce
the difficulty of learning tasks, we discard irrelevant features and obtain an
optimal subset of features. After superpixel segmentation, the images are
transformed into graphs with superpixels as nodes, which are fed into the
deeper graph convolutional neural network for node classification. This graph
neural network uses a differentiable aggregation function to aggregate the
features of nodes and neighbors to form more advanced features. It is the first
time using it for dark spot detection. To validate our method, we mark all dark
spots on six SAR images covering the Baltic Sea and construct a dark spots
detection dataset, which has been made publicly available

Reconciliation methods have been shown to improve forecast accuracy, but will,
in general, adjust the base forecast of every series. However, in an
operational context, it is sometimes necessary or beneficial to keep forecasts
of some variables unchanged after forecast reconciliation. In this paper, we
formulate reconciliation methodology that keeps forecasts of a pre-specified

on entanglement distribution do not account for the decoherence of qubits
inside quantum memories and, thus, their designs become impractical since they
assume an infinite lifetime of quantum states. In this paper, we bring forth a
novel analysis of the performance of QCNs in a physics-informed manner, by
relying on the quantum physics principles that underly the different components
of QCNs. The need of the physics-informed approach is then assessed and its
fundamental role in designing practical QCNs is analyzed across various open

metrics and controls that enable QCNs to leverage the state-of-the-art
advancements in quantum technologies to enhance their performance. Finally, we
analyze multiple pressing challenges and open research directions in QCNs that
must be treated using a physics-informed approach to lead practically viable

real-world entity. Despite the effort in the past years to improve the
performance in EM, the existing methods still require a huge amount of labeled
data in each domain during the training phase. These methods treat each domain
individually, and capture the specific signals for each dataset in EM, and this
leads to overfitting on just one dataset. The knowledge that is learned from
one dataset is not utilized to better understand the EM task in order to make
predictions on the unseen datasets with fewer labeled samples. In this paper,
we propose a new domain adaptation-based method that transfers the task
knowledge from multiple source domains to a target domain. Our method presents
a new setting for EM where the objective is to capture the task-specific
knowledge from pretraining our model using multiple source domains, then
testing our model on a target domain. We study the zero-shot learning case on
the target domain, and demonstrate that our method learns the EM task and
transfers knowledge to the target domain. We extensively study fine-tuning our
model on the target dataset from multiple domains, and demonstrate that our
model generalizes better than state-of-the-art methods in EM.

this behaviour is related to the question of `how often' a point under

private information at a cost proportional to entropy reduction. When a
policymaker provides more public information, agents acquire less private
information, thus lowering information costs. Does more public information
raise or reduce uncertainty faced by agents? Is it beneficial or detrimental to
welfare? To address these questions, we examine the impacts of public
information on flexible information acquisition in a linear-quadratic-Gaussian
game with arbitrary quadratic material welfare. More public information raises
uncertainty if and only if the game exhibits strategic complementarity, which
can be harmful to welfare. However, when agents acquire a large amount of
information, more provision of public information increases welfare through a
substantial reduction in the cost of information. We give a necessary and
sufficient condition for welfare to increase with public information and
identify optimal public information disclosure, which is either full or partial
disclosure depending upon the welfare function and the slope of the best

radius cause unidirectional water flow without osmotic pressure, which can be
attributed to hysteresis in the cyclic transition between the wetting/drying

white, Brownian, and pink noises. Because of the high-frequency components in
white noise, fast switching of open and close states inhibits channel wetting.
Conversely, pink and Brownian noises generate high-pass filtered net flow.
Brownian fluctuation leads to a faster water transport rate, whereas pink noise
has a higher capability to overcome osmotic pressure in the opposite direction.
A trade-off relationship exists between the resonant frequency of the
fluctuation and the flow amplification. The proposed pump can be considered as
an analogy for the reversed Carnot cycle, which is the upper limit on the

spread can be conveniently represented by a multivariate normal distribution
truncated to the non-negative space under a unit simplex. Here this
distribution is called the simplex-truncated multivariate normal distribution.
For calculations on truncated distributions, it is often useful to obtain rapid
estimates of their integral, mean and covariance; these quantities
characterising the truncated distribution will generally possess different
values to the corresponding non-truncated distribution. In this paper, three
different approaches that can estimate the integral, mean and covariance of any
simplex-truncated multivariate normal distribution are described and compared.
These three approaches are (1) naive rejection sampling, (2) a method described
by Gessner et al. that unifies subset simulation and the Holmes-Diaconis-Ross
algorithm with an analytical version of elliptical slice sampling, and (3) a
semi-analytical method that expresses the integral, mean and covariance in
terms of integrals of hyperrectangularly-truncated multivariate normal
distributions, the latter of which are readily computed in modern mathematical
and statistical packages. Strong agreement is demonstrated between all three
approaches, but the most computationally efficient approach depends strongly
both on implementation details and the dimension of the simplex-truncated
multivariate normal distribution. For computations in low-dimensional
distributions, the semi-analytical method is fast and thus should be
considered. As the dimension increases, the Gessner et al. method becomes the
only practically efficient approach of the methods tested here.

determined by the dual optical-electrical history. This unique behaviour is
obtained in a device of ultimate simplicity: an interface between a
high-temperature superconductor and a transparent semiconductor. The
microscopic mechanism at play is a reversible nanoscale redox reaction between
both materials, whose oxygen content determines the electron tunnelling rate
across their interface. Oxygen exchange is controlled here via illumination by
exploiting a competition between electrochemistry, photovoltaic effects and
photo-assisted ion migration. In addition to their fundamental interest, the

of BeiDou-G2 was found to be annual oscillation, mainly due to the solar

we confirmed that in the last 10 years, the satellite had six abnormal events.

caused by suspected fuel leakages. Additionally, the abnormal events included
one collision in 2012, which was inferred to be the trigger of the fuel
leakages in the following years. No rotational speed abnormalities occurred

  Convergence","43 pages, 16 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider minimizing a smooth and strongly convex objective function using
a stochastic Newton method. At each iteration, the algorithm is given an oracle
access to a stochastic estimate of the Hessian matrix. The oracle model
includes popular algorithms such as Subsampled Newton and Newton Sketch.
Despite using second-order information, these existing methods do not exhibit
superlinear convergence, unless the stochastic noise is gradually reduced to
zero during the iteration, which would lead to a computational blow-up in the
per-iteration cost. We propose to address this limitation with Hessian
averaging: instead of using the most recent Hessian estimate, our algorithm
maintains an average of all the past estimates. This reduces the stochastic
noise while avoiding the computational blow-up. We show that this scheme
exhibits local $Q$-superlinear convergence with a non-asymptotic rate of
$(\Upsilon\sqrt{\log (t)/t}\,)^{t}$, where $\Upsilon$ is proportional to the
level of stochastic noise in the Hessian oracle. A potential drawback of this
(uniform averaging) approach is that the averaged estimates contain Hessian
information from the global phase of the method, i.e., before the iterates
converge to a local neighborhood. This leads to a distortion that may
substantially delay the superlinear convergence until long after the local
neighborhood is reached. To address this drawback, we study a number of
weighted averaging schemes that assign larger weights to recent Hessians, so
that the superlinear convergence arises sooner, albeit with a slightly slower
rate. Remarkably, we show that there exists a universal weighted averaging
scheme that transitions to local convergence at an optimal stage, and still
exhibits a superlinear convergence rate nearly (up to a logarithmic factor)
matching that of uniform Hessian averaging.

binning in time series NLFF modeling of individual active regions (ARs) in
order to quantify the effect of a different underlying spatial sampling on the
quality of modeling as well as on the derived physical parameters. We apply an
optimization method to sequences of SDO/HMI vector magnetogram data at three
different plate scales for three solar ARs to obtain nine NLFF model time
series. From the NLFF models, we deduce active-region magnetic fluxes, electric
currents, magnetic energies and relative helicities, and analyze those with
respect to the underlying spatial sampling. We calculate various metrics to
quantify the quality of the derived NLFF models and apply a Helmholtz
decomposition to characterize solenoidal errors. At a given spatial sampling,
the quality of NLFF modeling is different for different ARs, as well as varies
along of the individual model time series. For a given AR, modeling at a given
spatial sampling is not necessarily of superior quality compared to that
performed with a different plate scale. Generally, the NLFF model quality tends
to be higher for larger pixel sizes with the solenoidal quality being the
ultimate cause for systematic variations in model-deduced physical quantities.
Optimization-based modeling based on binned SDO/HMI vector data delivers
magnetic energies and helicity estimates different by $\lesssim$30\%, given
that concise checks ensure the physical plausibility and high solenoidal
quality of the tested model. Thus, spatial-sampling-induced differences are
relatively small compared to that arising from other sources of uncertainty.

Specifically, we categorize the efforts of NAT into several groups, including
data manipulation, modeling methods, training criterion, decoding algorithms,
and the benefit from pre-trained models. Furthermore, we briefly review other
applications of NAR models beyond machine translation, such as dialogue

conducted by the LETGS instrument on board of the Chandra X-ray Observatory and
four FUV observations were carried out using the Hubble STIS spectrograph. From
the X-ray light curves, we determined a variation of the quiescent count rate
by a factor of two within 20\% of the stellar rotation period. To obtain the
DEM, 18 optically thin emission lines were analysed (12 X-ray and six FUV). The
flare fluxes differ from the quiescence fluxes by factors of 4-20 (FUV) and
1-30 (X-ray). The temperature structure of the stellar corona and transition
region was determined for both the quiescence and flaring state by fitting the

Compared to quiescence, the emission measure increases during flares for

various tasks such as backdoor removal, neural network repair for fairness and
safety properties. Our experiment results show that CARE is able to repair all
neural networks efficiently and effectively. For fairness repair tasks, CARE
successfully improves fairness by $61.91\%$ on average. For backdoor removal
tasks, CARE reduces the attack success rate from over $98\%$ to less than
$1\%$. For safety property repair tasks, CARE reduces the property violation
rate to less than $1\%$. Results also show that thanks to the causality-based
fault localization, CARE's repair focuses on the misbehavior and preserves the

Previous methods usually adopt a sequence model (e.g., Transformer and LSTM) as

straight-forward to compute the total Hall current in the spin basis. For the
reason, we develop a systematic and transparent scheme to separate the three
different contributions in the spin basis for relativistic systems by building
a one-to-one correspondence between the Feynman diagrams of the different
mechanisms in the chiral basis and the products of the symmetric and
anti-symmetric part of the polarization operator in the spin basis. We obtain
the three contributions of the AHE in tilted Weyl metals by this scheme and

artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, the development of these workflows

potential which specifies the interactions in an ensemble of classical
particles in continuous space, given the density and the equilibrium pair
correlation function of these particles as data. For a canonical ensemble in a
bounded domain it has been observed that this pair potential minimizes a
corresponding convex relative entropy functional, and that the Newton iteration
for minimizing this functional coincides with the so-called inverse Monte Carlo
(IMC) iterative scheme. In this paper we show that in the thermodynamic limit
analogous connections exist between the specific relative entropy introduced by
Georgii and Zessin and a proper formulation of the IMC iteration in the full
space. This provides a rigorous variational framework for the inverse Henderson
problem, valid within a large class of pair potentials, including, for example,
Lennard-Jones type potentials.
  It is further shown that the pressure is strictly convex as a function of the
pair potential and the chemical potential, and that the specific relative
entropy at fixed density is a strictly convex function of the pair potential.
At a given reference potential and a corresponding density in the gas phase we
determine the gradient and the Hessian of the specific relative entropy, and we
prove that the Hessian extends to a symmetric positive semidefinite quadratic
functional in the space of square integrable perturbations of this potential.

for classifying pixels in hyperspectral images. The method consists of three
stages. In the first stage, the pre-processing stage, Nested Sliding Window
algorithm is used to reconstruct the original data by {enhancing the

our method gives the overall best performance in accuracy. Especially, our gain

Based (MDB) filter for image restoration. The aim of image enhancement is to
reconstruct the true image from the corrupted image. The process of image
acquisition frequently leads to degradation and the quality of the digitized
image becomes inferior to the original image. Image degradation can be due to
the addition of different types of noise in the original image. Image noise can
be modelled of many types and impulse noise is one of them. Impulse noise
generates pixels with gray value not consistent with their local neighbourhood.
It appears as a sprinkle of both light and dark or only light spots in the
image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter is the
filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination of
neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of
smoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is
the one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small
neighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high
noise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Mean (CWM)
filter has got a better average performance over the median filter. However the
original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high noise
condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To
illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach, the proposed new scheme

be removed in such a way that important information of image should be

The algorithm performs two simultaneous operations, namely, detection of
corrupted pixels and evaluation of new pixels for replacing the corrupted
pixels. Removal of these artifacts is achieved without damaging edges and
details. However, the restricted window size renders median operation less
effective whenever noise is excessive in that case the proposed algorithm
automatically switches to mean filtering. The performance of the algorithm is
analyzed in terms of Mean Square Error [MSE], Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
[PSNR], Signal-to-Noise Ratio Improved [SNRI], Percentage Of Noise Attenuated
[PONA], and Percentage Of Spoiled Pixels [POSP]. This is compared with standard
algorithms already in use and improved performance of the proposed algorithm is
presented. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that a single algorithm
can replace several independent algorithms which are required for removal of
different artifacts.

  Classification","13 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Attention mechanisms have significantly boosted the performance of video
classification neural networks thanks to the utilization of perspective
contexts. However, the current research on video attention generally focuses on
adopting a specific aspect of contexts (e.g., channel, spatial/temporal, or
global context) to refine the features and neglects their underlying
correlation when computing attentions. This leads to incomplete context
utilization and hence bears the weakness of limited performance improvement. To
tackle the problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-in-attention
(AIA) method for element-wise feature refinement, which investigates the
feasibility of inserting the channel context into the spatio-temporal attention
learning module, referred to as CinST, and also its reverse variant, referred
to as STinC. Specifically, we instantiate the video feature contexts as
dynamics aggregated along a specific axis with global average and max pooling
operations. The workflow of an AIA module is that the first attention block
uses one kind of context information to guide the gating weights calculation of
the second attention that targets at the other context. Moreover, all the
computational operations in attention units act on the pooled dimension, which
results in quite few computational cost increase ($<$0.02\%). To verify our
method, we densely integrate it into two classical video network backbones and
conduct extensive experiments on several standard video classification
benchmarks. The source code of our AIA is available at

present the development of an asymptotic theory for difference equations, which

new method was introduced into this field in the nineteen nineties, which is

polynomials which do not satisfy any differential or difference equations
neither do they have any integral representations. As an example, we mention
the case of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Freud weight. Finally,
we show how the Wiener-Hopf technique can be used to derive asymptotic
expansions for the solutions of an integral equation on a half line.

simulation of a similar flow is used for verification of BKE results. We
demonstrate that BKE can provide the steady flow profiles close to those
obtained from MD simulations in both subsonic and supersonic regimes of steady

BKE results to have a good accuracy in a wide range of gas flow parameters.
  MD confirms that a steady supersonic gas flow condensates on a surface at the
distinctive temperature after formation of a standing shock front in reference
to this surface, which can be interpreted as a permeable condensating piston.
The last produces the shock compression but completely absorbs incoming gas
flow in contrast to a common impermeable piston. The shock front divides the
vapor flow on the supersonic and subsonic zones, and condensation of compressed
gas happens in the subsonic regime. The complete and partial condensation
regimes are discussed. It is shown that above the certain surface temperatures
determined by the shock Hugoniot the runaway shock front stops an inflow gas

images, it is challenging to create public large labeled sonar datasets to
train supervised learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the
potential of three self-supervised learning methods (RotNet, Denoising
Autoencoders, and Jigsaw) to learn high-quality sonar image representation
without the need of human labels. We present pre-training and transfer learning
results on real-life sonar image datasets. Our results indicate that
self-supervised pre-training yields classification performance comparable to
supervised pre-training in a few-shot transfer learning setup across all three
methods. Code and self-supervised pre-trained models are be available at

monolayers of relevance for materials, such as particle-stabilized emulsions
and foams, and processes, e. g. particle-based lithography. In spite of its
importance, experimentally determining the three-dimensional shape of soft

this work, we take poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) microgels as model soft

aqueous and an oil phase can be fully reconstructed by means of in-situ atomic

from both sides of the interface allows one to characterize the in-plane
deformation of the particle under the action of interfacial tension and to
visualize the occurrence of asymmetric swelling in the two fluids.
Additionally, the technique enables investigating different fluid phases and
particle architectures, as well as studying in situ the effect of temperature
variations on particle conformation. We envisage that these results open up an
exciting range of possibilities to provide microscopic insights between the
single-particle behavior of soft objects at fluid interfaces and macroscopic

  Demand Management",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel congestion mitigation strategy for low voltage
residential feeders in which the rising power demand due to the electrification
of the transport and heating systems leads to congestion problems. The strategy
is based on requiring residential customers to limit their demand for a certain
amount of time in exchange for economic benefits.
  The main novelty of the method consists of combining a thorough
representation of the network physics with advanced constraints that ensure the
comfort of residential users, in a scalable manner that suits real systems. The
mitigation strategy is presented from a DSO perspective, and takes the form of
contracts between users and system operator. The focus on user comfort aims to
make the contracts appealing, encouraging users to voluntarily enroll in the
proposed mitigation scheme.
  The presented solution is implemented as a mixed-integer multi-period optimal
power flow problem which relies on a linearized three-phase power flow
formulation. Calculations on 100 real-life distribution feeders are performed,
to analyze the congestion-relieving potential of several possible system
operator-user contracts. From a planning perspective, the results can help the
system operator define contractual terms that make a specific congestion
mitigation scheme effective and viable. From an operational perspective, the
same calculations can be used to optimally schedule power reduction on a
day-ahead basis.

region NOAA 11504, a rough correspondence between groups of the spikes observed
on 1000 MHz and peaks in the time profiles of AIA channels taken from the flare
sub-area close to the leading sunspot is found. Among types of spikes the SZ
type is the most interesting because it resembles to zebras. Therefore, using
auto-correlation and cross-correlation methods we compare SZ and SBN spikes
with the typical zebra observed in the same frequency range. While the ratio of
SZ band frequencies with their frequency separation (220 MHz) is about 4, 5 and
6, in the zebra the frequency stripe separation is about 24 MHz and the ratio
is around 50. Moreover, the bandwidth of SZ bands, which consists of clouds of
narrowband spikes, is much broader than that of zebra stripes. This comparison
indicates that SZ spikes are generated different way than the zebra, but
similar way as SBN spikes. We successfully fit the SZ band frequencies by the
Bernstein modes. Based on this fitting we interpret SZ and SBN spikes as those
generated in the model with Bernstein modes. Thus, the magnetic field and
plasma density in the SZ spike source is estimated as about 79 G and 8.4x10^9

decreasing the batchsize. This study thus contributes toward identifying

interactions typically leads to outlier features. To tackle this issue, we
propose a Neighbor Transformer Network, or NFormer, which explicitly models
interactions across all input images, thus suppressing outlier features and
leading to more robust representations overall. As modelling interactions
between enormous amount of images is a massive task with lots of distractors,
NFormer introduces two novel modules, the Landmark Agent Attention, and the
Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax. Specifically, the Landmark Agent Attention
efficiently models the relation map between images by a low-rank factorization
with a few landmarks in feature space. Moreover, the Reciprocal Neighbor
Softmax achieves sparse attention to relevant -- rather than all -- neighbors
only, which alleviates interference of irrelevant representations and further
relieves the computational burden. In experiments on four large-scale datasets,
NFormer achieves a new state-of-the-art. The code is released at

synchrotron radiation faster than decay. The magnetic field of $\sim 10^4 G$ is

collected in the field, manually separated into components, dried and weighed
to estimate species composition. Deep learning approaches using neural networks
have been used in previous work to propose faster and more cost efficient
alternatives to this process by estimating the biomass information from a
picture of an area of pasture alone. Deep learning approaches have, however,
struggled to generalize to distant geographical locations and necessitated
further data collection to retrain and perform optimally in different climates.
In this work, we enhance the deep learning solution by reducing the need for
ground-truthed (GT) images when training the neural network. We demonstrate how
unsupervised contrastive learning can be used in the sward composition
prediction problem and compare with the state-of-the-art on the publicly
available GrassClover dataset collected in Denmark as well as a more recent
dataset from Ireland where we tackle herbage mass and height estimation.

problem for content distribution networks, online social networks and edge

toolbox for tackling this problem through the lens of \emph{optimistic} online
learning. We build upon the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework,
which is developed further here to include predictions for the file requests,
and we design online caching algorithms for bipartite networks with
pre-reserved or dynamic storage subject to time-average budget constraints. The
predictions are provided by a content recommendation system that influences the
users viewing activity and hence can naturally reduce the caching network's
uncertainty about future requests. We also extend the framework to learn and
utilize the best request predictor in cases where many are available. We prove
that the proposed {optimistic} learning caching policies can achieve
\emph{sub-zero} performance loss (regret) for perfect predictions, and maintain
the sub-linear regret bound $O(\sqrt T)$, which is the best achievable bound
for policies that do not use predictions, even for arbitrary-bad predictions.
The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated with detailed
trace-driven numerical tests.

industrialized world and ablation therapy is the method of choice for many
patients. However, ablation scars alter the electrophysiological activation and
the mechanical behavior of the affected atria. Different ablation strategies
with the aim to terminate atrial fibrillation and prevent its recurrence exist
but their impact on the hemodynamic performance of the heart has not been
investigated thoroughly. In this work, we present a simulation study analyzing
five commonly used ablation scar patterns and their combinations in the left
atrium regarding their impact on the pumping function of the heart using an
electromechanical whole-heart model. We analyzed how the altered atrial
activation and increased stiffness due to the ablation scar affect atrial as
well as ventricular contraction and relaxation. We found that systolic and
diastolic function of the left atrium is impaired by ablation scars and that
the reduction of atrial stroke volume of up to 11.43% depends linearly on the
amount of inactivated tissue. Consequently, the end-diastolic volume of the
left ventricle, and thus stroke volume, was reduced by up to 1.4% and 1.8%,
respectively. During ventricular systole, left atrial pressure was increased by
up to 20% due to changes in the atrial activation sequence and the stiffening
of scar tissue. This study provides biomechanical evidence that atrial ablation
has acute effects not only on atrial contraction but also on ventricular
pumping function. Our results have the potential to help tailoring ablation
strategies towards minimal global hemodynamic impairment.

characteristics. The iron line emission is expected to originate in the
Wolf-Rayet star's dynamic stellar-wind when colliding the companion's mild
stellar wind. Here, we report the result of a long-term X-ray monitoring of
WR~102-1 since 1998 using archival data of ASCA, XMM-Newton, Chandra, Suzaku,
and Swift to reveal variations of the iron K-emission line and the
circumstellar absorption. Consequently, we have detected significant redshifts
of the iron K-emission line from the XMM-Newton observation in March 2003 and
the Suzaku observation in September 2006. Furthermore, when the red-shift was
observed, which suggests that the Wolf-Rayet star was in front of the companion
star, the circumstellar absorption values were smaller than other periods.
These results appear contrary to the expectation if the Wolf-Rayet's stellar
wind is spherically symmetric, but may be understood if the Wolf-Rayet star's
stellar wind is significantly distorted due to the rapid orbital motion near
the periastron.

different NOMA user pairs and within each pair. To efficiently solve this
nonconvex problem, we decompose the problem into three subproblems using block

each NOMA user pair, we construct a supermodular game with confirmed
convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Given the intra-pair power allocation,
successive convex approximation is applied to convexify and solve the

set of points to a target set is common in shape analysis. It is an example of
a problem in the diffeomorphic shape matching regime and can be thought of as a
type of spatial discretization of the more general LDDMM framework as it
transforms into a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system. In this paper, we
consider landmark matching modified by restricting the set of available vector
fields in the sense that vector fields are parametrized by a set of controls.
We determine the geometric setting of the problem, referred to as
sub-Riemannian landmark matching, and derive equations of motions for the
controls. We provide two computational algorithms and demonstrate them in
numerical examples. In particular, the experiments highlight the importance of
the regularization term. The reason why this is of interest is that
sub-Riemannian landmark matching is demonstrated to have connections with
neural networks, in particular the interpretation of residual neural networks
as time discretizations of continuous control problems. It allows shape
analysis practitioners to think about neural networks in terms of shape
analysis, thereby providing a bridge between the two fields.

multitude of different approaches are currently in use. Optimization-based
motion planning is one method, that often heavily relies on distance
computations between robots and obstacles. These computations can easily become
a bottleneck, as they do not scale well with the complexity of the robots or
the environment. To improve performance, many different methods suggested to
use collision primitives, i.e. simple shapes that approximate the more complex
rigid bodies, and that are simpler to compute distances to and from. However,
each pair of primitives requires its own specialized code, and certain pairs
are known to suffer from numerical issues. In this paper, we propose an
easy-to-use, unified treatment of a wide variety of primitives. We formulate
distance computation as a minimization problem, which we solve iteratively. We
show how to take derivatives of this minimization problem, allowing it to be
seamlessly integrated into a trajectory optimization method. Our experiments
show that our method performs favourably, both in terms of timing and the
quality of the trajectory. The source code of our implementation will be

Particularly, we show that the number of runs used in many benchmarking

be insufficient to reliably rank algorithms on well-known numerical
optimization benchmarks.
  Additionally, methods for automated algorithm configuration are sensitive to
insufficient sample sizes. This may result in the configurator choosing a
`lucky' but poor-performing configuration despite exploring better ones. We
show that relying on mean performance values, as many configurators do, can
require a large number of runs to provide accurate comparisons between the

spatially varying energy spectra to distinguish between the processes and use
thermal Galactic dust observations to indicate the preferred sites of hadronic

remnants (SNRs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) show unusually high
forbidden-to-resonance ($f/r$) line ratios. While their origin is still
uncertain and debated, most of these SNRs have asymmetric morphology and/or
show evidence of interaction with dense material, which may hint at the true
nature of the anomalous $f/r$ ratios. Here we report on a detailed spectral
analysis of an LMC SNR J0453.6$-$6829 with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer
(RGS) onboard XMM-Newton. We find that the $f/r$ ratio of O$~$VII
($=1.06^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$) is significantly higher than expected from the
previously-reported thermal model. The spectrum is fairly explained by taking
into account a charge exchange (CX) emission in addition to the thermal
component. Analyzing archival ATCA & Parkes radio data, we also reveal that
H$~$I cloud is possibly interacting with J0453.6$-$6829. These results support
the presence of CX in J0453.6$-$6829, as the origin of the obtained high $f/r$
ratio. Although a contribution of the resonance scattering (RS) cannot be ruled
out at this time, we conclude that CX seems more likely than RS considering the
relatively symmetric morphology of this remnant.

study in computational linguistics of measuring the intensity of complaints
from text. Analyzing complaints from such perspective is particularly useful,
as complaints of certain degrees may cause severe consequences for companies or
organizations. We create the first Chinese dataset containing 3,103 posts about
complaints from Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. These posts are
then annotated with complaints intensity scores using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS)
method. We show that complaints intensity can be accurately estimated by
computational models with the best mean square error achieving 0.11.
Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis around complaints,
including the connections between complaints and sentiment, and a cross-lingual
comparison for complaints expressions used by Chinese and English speakers. We
finally show that our complaints intensity scores can be incorporated for
better estimating the popularity of posts on social media.

live-chatting to discuss emergent bugs/errors they encounter in daily

such knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chat
data. In this paper, we first formulate the task of identifying and
synthesizing bug reports from community live chats, and propose a novel
approach, named BugListener, to address the challenges. Specifically,
BugListener automates three sub-tasks: 1) Disentangle the dialogs from massive
chat logs by using a Feed-Forward neural network; 2) Identify the bug-report
dialogs from separated dialogs by modeling the original dialog to the
graph-structured dialog and leveraging the graph neural network to learn the
contextual information; 3) Synthesize the bug reports by utilizing the TextCNN
model and Transfer Learning network to classify the sentences into three
groups: observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB), and steps to
reproduce the bug (SR). BugListener is evaluated on six open source projects.
The results show that: for bug report identification, BugListener achieves the
average F1 of 74.21%, improving the best baseline by 10.37%; and for bug report
synthesis task, BugListener could classify the OB, EB, and SR sentences with
the F1 of 67.37%, 87.14%, and 65.03%, improving the best baselines by 7.21%,
7.38%, 5.30%, respectively. A human evaluation also confirms the effectiveness
of BugListener in generating relevant and accurate bug reports. These
demonstrate the significant potential of applying BugListener in
community-based software development, for promoting bug discovery and quality
improvement.

directly affects users' experience and satisfaction, thus playing a critical
role in MRS. Despite the improvement achieved in the existing work, three
issues are yet to be solved. First, users' historical behaviors contain rich
preference information, such as users' long and short-term interests, but are
not fully exploited in reranking. Previous work typically treats items in
history equally important, neglecting the dynamic interaction between the
history and candidate items. Second, existing reranking models focus on
learning interactions at the item level while ignoring the fine-grained
feature-level interactions. Lastly, estimating the reranking score on the
ordered initial list before reranking may lead to the early scoring problem,
thereby yielding suboptimal reranking performance. To address the above issues,
we propose a framework named Multi-level Interaction Reranking (MIR). MIR
combines low-level cross-item interaction and high-level set-to-list
interaction, where we view the candidate items to be reranked as a set and the
users' behavior history in chronological order as a list. We design a novel
SLAttention structure for modeling the set-to-list interactions with
personalized long-short term interests. Moreover, feature-level interactions
are incorporated to capture the fine-grained influence among items. We design
MIR in such a way that any permutation of the input items would not change the
output ranking, and we theoretically prove it. Extensive experiments on three
public and proprietary datasets show that MIR significantly outperforms the

Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a

free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments,
which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in
this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in
shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress
gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations
including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP)
equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the
dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves.
We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free
surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the
collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and

although meteor showers are commonly associated with the activity of periodic
comets. What is most peculiar to the asteroid is its comet-like activity in the
ejection of micrometer-sized dust particles at every perihelion passage, while
the activity of the asteroid has never been identified outside the
near-perihelion zone at $0.14~\mathrm{au}$ from the Sun. From the theoretical
point of view, we argue that the activity of the asteroid is well explained by
the electrostatic lofting of micrometer-sized dust particles with the aid of
mobile alkali ions at high temperatures. The mass-loss rates of
micrometer-sized particles from the asteroid in our model is entirely
consistent with the values inferred from visible observations of Phaethon's
dust tail. For millimeter-sized particles, we predict three orders of

of the Geminid meteoroid stream by the electrostatic lofting mechanism.

invariance of a given set in terms of safety of a general nonlinear control
system subject to input constraints. From the point of view of controller
design, the proposed method provides an approach to synthesize a safe control
law that guarantees that the trajectories of the system starting from a given
initial set do not enter an unsafe set. Unlike the related control Barrier

tangent cone of the zero level set defined by the certificates, and is shown to
be less conservative by means of numerical evidence. For polynomial systems
with semi-algebraic initial and safe sets, CBCs and safe control laws can be
synthesized using sum-of-squares decomposition and semi-definite programming.

Comprehensive bitcell-level electrical characterization is used to estimate the

energy-efficient small-to-large embedded memories can be obtained by
significantly relaxing the non-volatility requirement of DMTJ devices at room

typical 10-years retention time at cryogenic temperatures. This makes
DMTJ-based STT-MRAM operating at 77K more energy-efficient than six-transistors

and -37% on average, respectively). Obtained results thus prove that DMTJ-based

to resolve the problem, we design a generic and efficient AT improvement
scheme, namely case-aware adversarial training (CAT). Specifically, the
intuition stems from the fact that a very limited part of informative samples
can contribute to most of model performance. Alternatively, if only the most
informative AEs are used in AT, we can lower the computation complexity of AT
significantly as maintaining the defense effect. To achieve this, CAT achieves
two breakthroughs. First, a method to estimate the information degree of
adversarial examples is proposed for AE filtering. Second, to further enrich
the information that the NN can obtain from AEs, CAT involves a weight
estimation and class-level balancing based sampling strategy to increase the
diversity of AT at each iteration. Extensive experiments show that CAT is
faster than vanilla AT by up to 3x while achieving competitive defense effect.

  subspace encoding","Accepted to ICLR 2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Continuous-time (CT) modeling has proven to provide improved sample
efficiency and interpretability in learning the dynamical behavior of physical
systems compared to discrete-time (DT) models. However, even with numerous
recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification
problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects
such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and
general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that
addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on
multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the
CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder
approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the
complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the
data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each
subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and
good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of
subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary
requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the
proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of
CT NL-SS models.

how they depend on the beam parameters, such as photon frequency or phase

supervised methods need complete temporal boundary annotations to achieve
promising results, which is costly since the annotator needs to watch the whole
moment. Weakly supervised methods only rely on the paired video and query, but
the performance is relatively poor. In this paper, we look closer into the
annotation process and propose a new paradigm called ""glance annotation"". This
paradigm requires the timestamp of only one single random frame, which we refer
to as a ""glance"", within the temporal boundary of the fully supervised
counterpart. We argue this is beneficial because comparing to weak supervision,
trivial cost is added yet more potential in performance is provided. Under the
glance annotation setting, we propose a method named as Video moment retrieval
via Glance Annotation (ViGA) based on contrastive learning. ViGA cuts the input
video into clips and contrasts between clips and queries, in which glance
guided Gaussian distributed weights are assigned to all clips. Our extensive
experiments indicate that ViGA achieves better results than the

specific proteins. To tackle this problem using machine learning methods, here
we propose a novel and effective framework, known as GraphBP, to generate 3D
molecules that bind to given proteins by placing atoms of specific types and
locations to the given binding site one by one. In particular, at each step, we
first employ a 3D graph neural network to obtain geometry-aware and chemically
informative representations from the intermediate contextual information. Such
context includes the given binding site and atoms placed in the previous steps.
Second, to preserve the desirable equivariance property, we select a local
reference atom according to the designed auxiliary classifiers and then
construct a local spherical coordinate system. Finally, to place a new atom, we
generate its atom type and relative location w.r.t. the constructed local
coordinate system via a flow model. We also consider generating the variables
of interest sequentially to capture the underlying dependencies among them.
Experiments demonstrate that our GraphBP is effective to generate 3D molecules
with binding ability to target protein binding sites. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/divelab/GraphBP.

  Array",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Eigen-decomposition-based direction finding methods of using
large-scale/ultra-large-scale fully-digital receive antenna arrays lead to a
high or ultra-high complexity. To address the complexity dilemma, in this
paper, three low-complexity estimators are proposed: partitioned subarray
auto-correlation combining (PSAC), partitioned subarray cross-correlation
combining (PSCC) and power iteration max correlation successive convex
approximation (PI-Max-CSCA). Compared with the conventional no-partitioned
direction finding method like root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC),
in the PSAC method, the total set of antennas are equally partitioned into
subsets of antennas, called subarrays, each subarray performs independent DOA
estimation, and all DOA estimates are coherently combined to give the final
estimation. For a better performance, the cross-correlation among sub-arrays is
further exploited in the PSCC method to achieve the near-Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) performance with the help of auto-correlation. To further reduce the
complexity, in the PI-Max-CSCA method, using a fraction of all subarrays to
make an initial coarse direction measurement (ICDM), the power iterative method
is adopted to compute the more precise steering vector (SV) by exploiting the
total array, and a more accurate DOA value is found using ICDM and SV through
the maximum correlation method solved by successive convex approximation.
Simulation results show that as the number of antennas goes to large-scale, the
proposed three methods can achieve a dramatic complexity reduction over
conventional Root-MUISC. Particularly, the PSCC and PI-Max-CSCA can reach the
CRLB while the PSAC shows a substantial performance loss.

Milky Way. Although relevant for star formation and evolution, its fundamental
parameters are not yet very well constrained. We aim to derive an accurate
distance and provide constraints on the cluster age. We used the photometric
and astrometric information available in the Gaia Early Data Release 3
(Gaia-EDR3) to infer its distance of 4.06$^{+0.36}_{-0.34}$ kpc. Modelling of
the eclipsing binary system W36, reported in Paper II, led to the distance of
4.03$\pm$0.25 kpc, in agreement with the Gaia-EDR3 distance and, therefore,
validating the parallax zero-point correction approach appropriate for red
objects. The weighted average distance based on these two methods results in
d$_{\rm wd1}$=4.05$\pm$0.20 kpc ($m-M$=13.04$^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$ mag), which has
an unprecedented accuracy of 5%. Using the Binary Population and Spectral
Synthesis (BPASS) models for the Red Supergiants with solar abundance, we
derived an age of 10.7$\pm$1 Myr, in excellent agreement with recent work by
Beasor & Davies (10.4$^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$ Myr) based on MIST evolutionary models.
In Paper II, the age of W36B was reported to be 6.4$\pm$0.5 Myr, supporting

Considering the time delay and the huge amount of energy released, the emitting
dust can hardly be pre-existing dust heated whether collisionally by shocks or
radiatively by peak SLSN luminosity or shock emission. Instead, it can be newly
formed dust additionally heated by the interaction of circum-stellar medium,

we formulate the RL problem with safety constraints as a non-zero-sum game.
While deployed with maximum entropy RL, this formulation leads to a safe
adversarially guided soft actor-critic framework, called SAAC. In SAAC, the
adversary aims to break the safety constraint while the RL agent aims to
maximize the constrained value function given the adversary's policy. The
safety constraint on the agent's value function manifests only as a repulsion
term between the agent's and the adversary's policies. Unlike previous
approaches, SAAC can address different safety criteria such as safe
exploration, mean-variance risk sensitivity, and CVaR-like coherent risk
sensitivity. We illustrate the design of the adversary for these constraints.
Then, in each of these variations, we show the agent differentiates itself from
the adversary's unsafe actions in addition to learning to solve the task.
Finally, for challenging continuous control tasks, we demonstrate that SAAC
achieves faster convergence, better efficiency, and fewer failures to satisfy
the safety constraints than risk-averse distributional RL and risk-neutral soft
actor-critic algorithms.

It has many applications in image editing and composition. Recently, deep
learning-based approaches have achieved great improvements in image matting.
However, most of them require a user-supplied trimap as an auxiliary input,
which limits the matting applications in the real world. Although some
trimap-free approaches have been proposed, the matting quality is still
unsatisfactory compared to trimap-based ones. Without the trimap guidance, the
matting models suffer from foreground-background ambiguity easily, and also
generate blurry details in the transition area. In this work, we propose
PP-Matting, a trimap-free architecture that can achieve high-accuracy natural
image matting. Our method applies a high-resolution detail branch (HRDB) that
extracts fine-grained details of the foreground with keeping feature resolution
unchanged. Also, we propose a semantic context branch (SCB) that adopts a
semantic segmentation subtask. It prevents the detail prediction from local
ambiguity caused by semantic context missing. In addition, we conduct extensive
experiments on two well-known benchmarks: Composition-1k and Distinctions-646.
The results demonstrate the superiority of PP-Matting over previous methods.
Furthermore, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our method on human matting
which shows its outstanding performance in the practical application. The code
and pre-trained models will be available at PaddleSeg:

manually by coaches and analysts. Due to the highly repetitive, yet dynamic and
subtle movements in fencing, manual data analysis can be inefficient and
inaccurate. We propose FenceNet as a novel architecture to automate the
classification of fine-grained footwork techniques in fencing. FenceNet takes
2D pose data as input and classifies actions using a skeleton-based action
recognition approach that incorporates temporal convolutional networks to
capture temporal information. We train and evaluate FenceNet on the Fencing
Footwork Dataset (FFD), which contains 10 fencers performing 6 different
footwork actions for 10-11 repetitions each (652 total videos). FenceNet
achieves 85.4% accuracy under 10-fold cross-validation, where each fencer is
left out as the test set. This accuracy is within 1% of the current
state-of-the-art method, JLJA (86.3%), which selects and fuses features
engineered from skeleton data, depth videos, and inertial measurement units.
BiFenceNet, a variant of FenceNet that captures the ""bidirectionality"" of human
movement through two separate networks, achieves 87.6% accuracy, outperforming
JLJA. Since neither FenceNet nor BiFenceNet requires data from wearable
sensors, unlike JLJA, they could be directly applied to most fencing videos,
using 2D pose data as input extracted from off-the-shelf 2D human pose
estimators. In comparison to JLJA, our methods are also simpler as they do not
require manual feature engineering, selection, or fusion.

to solve the multi-cloud configuration problem: given a workload, which cloud
provider should be chosen and how should its nodes be configured in order to
minimize runtime or cost? In this work, we consider solutions to this
optimization problem. We develop and evaluate possible adaptations of
state-of-the-art cloud configuration solutions to the multi-cloud domain.
Furthermore, we identify an analogy between multi-cloud configuration and the
selection-configuration problems commonly studied in the automated machine

optimizers from AutoML to solve multi-cloud configuration. Finally, we propose
a new algorithm for solving multi-cloud configuration, CloudBandit (CB). It
treats the outer problem of cloud provider selection as a best-arm

arbitrary black-box optimizer on the inner problem of node configuration. Our
experiments indicate that (a) many state-of-the-art cloud configuration

adaptations which utilize the hierarchical structure of the multi-cloud

PWNe, gamma rays are produced by electrons, accelerated at the pulsar wind
termination shock, through the inverse Compton scattering of 2.7 K CMB
radiation. The high conversion efficiency of pulsar rotational power to
relativistic electrons, combined with the short cooling timescales, allow
gamma-ray luminosities up to the level of $L_\gamma \sim 0.1 \dot{E}$. The
pulsar spin-down luminosity, $\dot E$, also determines the absolute maximum

solutions with a dS core, sourced by an anisotropic fluid, which encodes the
quantum corrections. The latter are parametrized by a single length-scale
$\ell$, which has a dual interpretation as an effective ""quantum hair"" and as
the length-scale resolving the classical singularity. Depending on the value of
$\ell$, these solutions can have two horizons, be extremal (when the two
horizons merge) or be horizonless exotic stars. We also investigate the
thermodynamic behavior of our BH solutions and propose a generalization of the
area law in order to account for their entropy. We find a second-order phase
transition near extremality, when $\ell$ is of order of the classical
Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S}$. BHs with $\ell\sim R_{\rm S}$ are
thermodynamically preferred with respect to those with $\ell\ll R_{\rm S}$,
supporting the relevance of quantum corrections at horizon scales. We also find
that the extremal configuration is a zero-temperature, zero-entropy state with
its near-horizon geometry factorizing as AdS$_2\times$ S$^2$, signalizing the
possible relevance of these models for the information paradox. We show that
the presence of quantum corrections with $\ell\sim R_{\rm S}$ have observable
phenomenological signatures in the photon orbits and in the QNMs spectrum. In
particular, in the near-extremal regime, the imaginary part of the spectrum
scales with the temperature as $c_1/\ell+c_2\ell T_\text{H}^2$, while it goes

resampling previous examples becomes increasingly more important than obtaining

extensively explored in the last years and revealed a profound connection with
the quantum field theory's algebraic structure. Recently, it was found that
some universal contributions to the entanglement entropy and mutual information
may be non uniquely defined in theories with generalized symmetries. Here, we
study this issue in detail in the particular case of the entanglement entropy
of the Maxwell theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions for rotationally symmetric regions.
In this setup, the problem can be dimensionally reduced to a half-line. We find
that the only difference between the reduced problem for the Maxwell field and
the reduced scalar free field stems from the Fourier angular $n=0$ mode. This
simplification allows us to check explicitly the many issues that characterize
models with broken global symmetries. Namely, we manifestly show that the
additive algebras break Haag duality, and single out the non-local operators
which are responsible for the failure of this property. More interestingly, we
present concrete lattice realizations that confirm that the logarithmic
""universal"" term of the Maxwell entanglement entropy for disks depends on the
details of the algebra assignation. This ambiguity hinders the identification
of possible topological contributions characteristic of models with generalized
symmetries and tarnishes its universal character. We further calculate the
Maxwell mutual information for two nearly complementary concentric disks. We
obtain the expected universal contribution with a log-log dependence and check
that, unlike entropy, this is stable. Accordingly, this supports mutual
information as the appropriate probe to sense additivity-duality breaking and
the consequent universal topological contributions.

timing, and imaging constraints, plus possible correlations to AGN and host
galaxy properties, for 38 bright nearby AGN ($z<0.5$) from the BAT AGN
Spectroscopic Survey. Modeling Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra, we computed line
full-width half-maxima (FWHMs) and constructed Fe Ka line and 2-10 keV
continuum light curves. The FWHM provides one estimate of the Fe Ka emitting
region size, RFeKa, assuming virial motion. A second estimate comes from
comparing the degree of correlation between the variability of the continuum
and line-only light curves, compared to simulated light curves. Finally, we
extracted Chandra radial profiles to place upper limits on RFeKa. We found that
for 90% (21/24) of AGN with FWHM measurements, RFeKa is smaller than the
fiducial dust sublimation radius, Rsub. Despite a wide range of variability
properties, the constraints on the Fe Ka photon reprocessor size independently
confirm that RFeKa is smaller than Rsub in 83% of AGN. Finally, the imaging
analysis yields loose upper limits for all but two sources; notably, the
Circinus Galaxy and NGC 1068 show significant but subdominant extended Fe Ka
emission out to $\sim$100 and $\sim$800 pc, respectively. Based on independent
constraints, we conclude that the majority of the narrow Fe Ka emission in

inside Rsub, and thus it is associated either with the outer broad line region

changeable manufacturing systems that can be adapted to variable conditions
with little effort. At the same time, production recipes typically represent
important company know-how that should not be directly tied to changing plant
configurations. Thus, there is a need to model general production recipes
independent of specific plant layouts. For execution of such a recipe however,
a binding to then available production resources needs to be made. In this
contribution, select a suitable modeling language to model and execute such
recipes. Furthermore, we present an approach to solve the issue of recipe
modeling and execution in modular plants using semantically modeled
capabilities and skills as well as BPMN. We make use of BPMN to model
\emph{capability processes}, i.e. production processes referencing abstract
descriptions of resource functions. These capability processes are not bound to
a certain plant layout, as there can be multiple resources fulfilling the same
capability. For execution, every capability in a capability process is replaced
by a skill realizing it, effectively creating a \emph{skill process} consisting
of various skill invocations. The presented solution is capable of
orchestrating and executing complex processes that integrate production steps
with typical IT functionalities such as error handling, user interactions and
notifications. Benefits of the approach are demonstrated using a flexible
manufacturing system.

dark matter may be composed of either axions or dark photons, both of which can
be detected using an ultra-sensitive microwave cavity known as a haloscope. The
haloscope employed by ADMX consists of a cylindrical cavity operating at the
TM$_{010}$ mode and is sensitive to the QCD axion with masses of few $\mu$eV.
However, this haloscope design becomes challenging to implement for higher

consequently reducing the detection volume which diminishes the detected signal
power. ADMX-Orpheus mitigates this issue by operating a tunable,
dielectrically-loaded cavity at a higher-order mode, allowing the detection
volume to remain large. This paper describes the design, operation, analysis,

traffic and evaluate rapid urban transport planning interventions is often
lacking. Transport systems typically rely on traditional data sources providing
outdated mode-of-travel data due to their data latency, infrequent data
collection and high cost. To address this issue, we propose a method that
leverages mobile phone data as a cost-effective and rich source of geospatial
information to capture current human mobility patterns at unprecedented
spatiotemporal resolution. Our approach employs mobile phone application usage
traces to infer modes of transportation that are challenging to identify (bikes
and ride-hailing/taxi services) based on mobile phone location data. Using data
fusion and matrix factorization techniques, we integrate official data sources
(household surveys and census data) with mobile phone application usage data.
This integration enables us to reconstruct the official data and create an
updated dataset that incorporates insights from digital footprint data from
application usage. We illustrate our method using a case study focused on
Santiago, Chile successfully inferring four modes of transportation:
mass-transit, motorised, active, and taxi. Our analysis revealed significant
changes in transportation patterns between 2012 and 2020. We quantify a
reduction in mass-transit usage across municipalities in Santiago, except where
metro/rail lines have been more recently introduced, highlighting added
resilience to the public transport network of these infrastructure
enhancements. Additionally, we evidence an overall increase in motorised
transport throughout Santiago, revealing persistent challenges in promoting
urban sustainable transportation. We validate our findings comparing our
updated estimates with official smart card transaction data.

feature extraction step. This ignores valuable information that the algorithms
accumulate during the optimization process.
  In this work, we propose an alternative, online algorithm selection scheme
which we coin per-run algorithm selection. In our approach, we start the
optimization with a default algorithm, and, after a certain number of
iterations, extract instance features from the observed trajectory of this
initial optimizer to determine whether to switch to another optimizer. We test
this approach using the CMA-ES as the default solver, and a portfolio of six
different optimizers as potential algorithms to switch to. In contrast to other
recent work on online per-run algorithm selection, we warm-start the second
optimizer using information accumulated during the first optimization phase. We
show that our approach outperforms static per-instance algorithm selection. We
also compare two different feature extraction principles, based on exploratory

individuals and society. Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past
news and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made,
existing fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in
the real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability
to future data. For example, 97\% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the
entity `Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to
merely 33\% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to
hardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about
`Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an
entity debiasing framework (\textbf{ENDEF}) which generalizes fake news
detection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a
cause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news
contents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause
(entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the
direct effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline
experiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed
framework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and
online tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake
news detection models to the future data. The code has been released at

momentum (OAM) has been proposed [Kim et al. Phys. Rev. B 105, L081301(2022)].
Here, we evaluate the orbital magnetization and optical conductivity as
physical observables for such a system. We show that the OAM of light induces
nonzero orbital magnetization and current density. The orbital magnetization
density increases linearly as a function of OAM degree. In certain regimes, we
find that orbital magnetization density is independent of the system size,
width, and Rabi frequency of light. It is shown that the orbital magnetization
arising from our Floquet theory is large and can be probed by magnetometry
measurements. Furthermore, we study the optical conductivity for various types
of electron transitions between different states such as vortex, edge, and bulk
that are present in the system. Based on conductance frequency peaks, a scheme

available current result about the well-studied switch Markov chain is that it
is rapidly mixing on P-stable degree sequences (see
DOI:10.1016/j.ejc.2021.103421). The switch Markov chain does not change any
degree sequence. However, there are cases where degree intervals are specified
rather than a single degree sequence. (A natural scenario where this problem
arises is in hypothesis testing on social networks that are only partially

notion of degree interval Markov chain which uses three (separately
well-studied) local operations (switch, hinge-flip and toggle), and employing
on degree sequence realizations where any two sequences under scrutiny have
very small coordinate-wise distance. Recently Amanatidis and Kleer published a
beautiful paper (arXiv:2110.09068), showing that the degree interval Markov
chain is rapidly mixing if the sequences are coming from a system of very thin
intervals which are centered not far from a regular degree sequence. In this

interesting alternatives to build the Last-Level Cache (LLC). Their advantages,
compared to SRAM memory, are higher density and lower static power, but write
operations wear out the bitcells to the point of eventually losing their
storage capacity. In this context, this paper presents a novel LLC organization
designed to extend the lifetime of the NV data array and a procedure to
forecast in detail the capacity and performance of such an NV-LLC over its
lifetime. From a methodological point of view, although different approaches
are used in the literature to analyze the degradation of an NV-LLC, none of
them allows to study in detail its temporal evolution. In this sense, this work
proposes a forecast procedure that combines detailed simulation and prediction,
allowing an accurate analysis of the impact of different cache control policies
and mechanisms (replacement, wear-leveling, compression, etc.) on the temporal
evolution of the indices of interest, such as the effective capacity of the
NV-LLC or the system IPC. We also introduce L2C2, a LLC design intended for
implementation in NV memory technology that combines fault tolerance,
compression, and internal write wear leveling for the first time. Compression
is not used to store more blocks and increase the hit rate, but to reduce the
write rate and increase the lifetime during which the cache supports near-peak
performance. It has affordable hardware overheads compared to that of a
baseline NV-LLC without compression in terms of area, latency and energy
consumption, and increases up to 6-37 times the time in which 50\% of the
effective capacity is degraded, depending on the variability in the
manufacturing process.

However, these methods are often heuristic in nature, are prone to user bias
via manual data shifting or parameterization, and lack a native framework for
handling uncertainty in both the data and the resulting model of the superposed
data. In this work, we develop a data-driven, non-parametric method for
superposing experimental data with arbitrary coordinate transformations, which
employs Gaussian process regression to learn statistical models that describe
the data, and then uses maximum a posteriori estimation to optimally superpose
the data sets. This statistical framework is robust to experimental noise, and
automatically produces uncertainty estimates for the learned coordinate
transformations. Moreover, it is distinguished from black-box machine learning
in its interpretability -- specifically, it produces a model that may itself be
interrogated to gain insight into the system under study. We demonstrate these
salient features of our method through its application to four representative
data sets characterizing the mechanics of soft materials. In every case, our
method replicates results obtained using other approaches, but with reduced
bias and the addition of uncertainty estimates. This method enables a
standardized, statistical treatment of self-similar data across many fields,

the correlations established between the system and the incoming environmental

  Approach",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern code review is a critical and indispensable practice in a pull-request
development paradigm that prevails in Open Source Software (OSS) development.
Finding a suitable reviewer in projects with massive participants thus becomes
an increasingly challenging task. Many reviewer recommendation approaches
(recommenders) have been developed to support this task which apply a similar
strategy, i.e. modeling the review history first then followed by
predicting/recommending a reviewer based on the model. Apparently, the better
the model reflects the reality in review history, the higher recommender's
performance we may expect. However, one typical scenario in a pull-request
development paradigm, i.e. one Pull-Request (PR) (such as a revision or
addition submitted by a contributor) may have multiple reviewers and they may
impact each other through publicly posted comments, has not been modeled well
in existing recommenders. We adopted the hypergraph technique to model this
high-order relationship (i.e. one PR with multiple reviewers herein) and
developed a new recommender, namely HGRec, which is evaluated by 12 OSS
projects with more than 87K PRs, 680K comments in terms of accuracy and
recommendation distribution. The results indicate that HGRec outperforms the
state-of-the-art recommenders on recommendation accuracy. Besides, among the
top three accurate recommenders, HGRec is more likely to recommend a diversity
of reviewers, which can help to relieve the core reviewers' workload congestion
issue. Moreover, since HGRec is based on hypergraph, which is a natural and
interpretable representation to model review history, it is easy to accommodate
more types of entities and realistic relationships in modern code review
scenarios. As the first attempt, this study reveals the potentials of
hypergraph on advancing the pragmatic solutions for code reviewer
recommendation.

theoreticians and practitioners, edit distance provides an excellent lens
through which to understand how the theoretical analysis of algorithms impacts
practical implementations. From an applied perspective, the goals of
theoretical analysis are to predict the empirical performance of an algorithm
and to serve as a yardstick to design novel algorithms that perform well in
practice. In this paper, we systematically survey the types of theoretical
analysis techniques that have been applied to edit distance and evaluate the
extent to which each one has achieved these two goals. These techniques include
traditional worst-case analysis, worst-case analysis parametrized by edit
distance or entropy or compressibility, average-case analysis, semi-random
models, and advice-based models. We find that the track record is mixed. On one
hand, two algorithms widely used in practice have been born out of theoretical
analysis and their empirical performance is captured well by theoretical
predictions. On the other hand, all the algorithms developed using theoretical
analysis as a yardstick since then have not had any practical relevance. We
conclude by discussing the remaining open problems and how they can be tackled.

process, we investigate the performance of auger drilling in terms of sampling
efficiency, defined as the mass ratio of the soil sample collected in the
coring tube to its total volume at a given penetration depth, by means of
experiments, numerical simulations, as well as theoretical analysis. The ratio
of rotation to penetration speed is found to play a crucial role in the
sampling process. A continuum model for the coupled granular flow in both
coring and discharging channels is proposed to elucidate the physical mechanism
behind the sampling process. Supported by a comparison to experimental results,
the continuum model provides a practical way to predict the performance of
auger drilling. Further analysis reveals that the drilling process approaches a
steady state with constant granular flow speeds in both channels. In the steady
state, sampling efficiency decreases linearly with the growth of the rotation
to penetration speed ratio, which can be well captured by the analytical
solution of the model. The analytical solution also suggests that the sampling
efficiency is independent of gravity in the steady state, which has profound
implications for extraterrestrial sample collection in future space missions.

it turns out that the standard treatment is incapable of determining the

devolatilisation -- i.e. depletion of volatiles -- to the chemical composition
of planet-hosting stars to constrain bulk composition and interiors of
terrestrial-type exoplanets. In this work, we apply such an approach to a
selected sample of 13 planet-hosting Sun-like stars, for which high-precision
photospheric abundances have been determined in the first paper of the series.
With the resultant devolatilised stellar composition (i.e. the model planetary
bulk composition) as well as other constraints including mass and radius, we
model the detailed mineralogy and interior structure of hypothetical,
habitable-zone terrestrial planets (""exo-Earths"") around these stars. Model
output shows that most of these exo-Earths are expected to have broadly
Earth-like composition and interior structure, consistent with conclusions
derived independently from analysis of polluted white dwarfs. The exceptions
are the Kepler-10 and Kepler-37 exo-Earths, which we predict are strongly
oxidised and thus would develop metallic cores much smaller than Earth.
Investigating our devolatilisation model at its extremes as well as varying
planetary mass and radius (within the terrestrial regime) reveals potential
diversities in the interiors of terrestrial planets. By considering (i)
high-precision stellar abundances, (ii) devolatilisation, and (iii) planetary
mass and radius holistically, this work represents essential steps to explore
the detailed mineralogy and interior structure of terrestrial-type exoplanets,
which in turn are fundamental for our understanding of planetary dynamics and

prerequisite for a broad range of biomedical applications. Despite the
encouraging progress of existing computational approaches in protein function
prediction, it remains challenging to annotate proteins to a novel function
that is not collected in the Gene Ontology and does not have any annotated
proteins. This limitation, a side effect from the widely-used multi-label
classification problem setting of protein function prediction, hampers the
progress of studying new pathways and biological processes, and further slows
down research in various biomedical areas. Here, we tackle this problem by
annotating proteins to a function only based on its textual description so that
we do not need to know any associated proteins for this function. The key idea
of our method ProTranslator is to redefine protein function prediction as a
machine translation problem, which translates the description word sequence of
a function to the amino acid sequence of a protein. We can then transfer
annotations from functions that have similar textual description to annotate a
novel function. We observed substantial improvement in annotating novel
functions and sparsely annotated functions on CAFA3, SwissProt and GOA
datasets. We further demonstrated how our method accurately predicted gene
members for a given pathway in Reactome, KEGG and MSigDB only based on the
pathway description. Finally, we showed how ProTranslator enabled us to
generate the textual description instead of the function label for a set of
proteins, providing a new scheme for protein function prediction. We envision
ProTranslator will give rise to a protein function ""search engine"" that returns

$1/T$ power-law, with $T$ a time-like variable denoting the quantity of data.
The presence of hidden variables can be incorporated in this setting, leading
to an additional driving term in the resulting flow equation. We illustrate
this with both analytic and numerical examples based on Gaussians and Gaussian
Random Processes and inference of the coupling constant in the 1D Ising model.
Finally we compare the qualitative behaviour exhibited by Bayesian flows to the

been made in recent years, dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
The widely-used CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution
or on progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatial
details are preserved but the contextual information cannot be precisely
encoded. In the latter case, generated outputs are semantically reliable but
spatially less accurate. This paper presents a new architecture with a holistic
goal of maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through
the entire network, and receiving complementary contextual information from the
low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale

multi-resolution convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b)
information exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) non-local
attention mechanism for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention

processes in physics: the total entropy of an isolated system can increase but
cannot decrease. The annihilation of an electric current in normal metal with
the generation of Joule heat because of a non-zero resistance is well-known
example of irreversible process. The persistent current, an undamped electric
current observed in a superconductor, annihilates after the transition into the
normal state. Therefore this transition was considered as irreversible
thermodynamic process before 1933. But if this transition is irreversible then
the Meissner effect discovered in 1933 is experimental evidence of a process
reverse to the irreversible process. Belief in the law of entropy increase
forced physicists to change their understanding of the superconducting
transition, which is considered a phase transition after 1933. This change has
resulted to the internal inconsistency of the conventional theory of
superconductivity, which is created within the framework of reversible
thermodynamics but predicts Joule heating. The persistent current annihilates
after the transition into the normal state with the generation of Joule heat
and reappears during the return to the superconducting state according to this
