distinguishing the supercooled regime from the high-temperature regime, the
microscopic origin of $T_\text{o}$ is not yet known. Here, we construct a

good agreement with the onset temperature found in various two-dimensional
atomistic models of glass formers. We discuss the predictions of our theory on
the displacement and density correlations of two-dimensional supercooled

discussed, including the fact that the average and standard deviation values of
the reconstruction errors depend only moderately on the extent of the errors as

potentially useful for quantum metrology. Our scheme is based on projective
measurements that measure the collective spin of the whole spin ensemble. A
local unitary rotation is applied conditionally on the measurement outcome,
such as to maximize the probability of obtaining spin zero on the subsequent

convergence is obtained towards the supersinglet state. Our sequence works
regardless of the initial state, and no postselection is required. Due to the

electronic inverters are inherently hybrid systems: they are controlled via

  Hybrid systems analysis could prove increasingly useful as large numbers of
renewable energy sources are incorporated to the grid with inverters as their

Lyapunov function for the dynamical system in terms of the system parameters,
which proves uniform, global, and asymptotic stability of the origin in error
coordinates. Moreover, we demonstrate robustness to parameter changes through
this Lyapunov function. We validate these results via simulation.
  Finally, we show empirically the incorporation of droop control with this

of droop control with the hybrid switching control can be considered a

points. At the testing phase, if the hypersphere has more than $N_{\text{L}}$
lattice points, we keep the $N_{\text{L}}$ closest points to the point
corresponding to the received FTN signal; however, if the hypersphere has less
than $N_{\text{L}}$ points, we increase the approximate initial radius by a
value that depends on the standard deviation of the distribution of the output
radii from the training phase. Then, the approximate value of the
log-likelihood ratio (LLR) is calculated based on the obtained $N_{\text{L}}$
points. Simulation results show that the computational complexity of the
proposed DL-LSD is lower than its counterpart of the original LSD by orders of
magnitude.

an information theoretic framework for understanding a relationship between an
input and an output in terms of a trade-off between the fidelity and complexity
of approximations to the relationship. Here we show that a crucial modification
-- distributing bottlenecks across multiple components of the input -- opens
fundamentally new avenues for interpretable deep learning in science. The
Distributed Information Bottleneck throttles the downstream complexity of
interactions between the components of the input, deconstructing a relationship
into meaningful approximations found through deep learning without requiring
custom-made datasets or neural network architectures. Applied to a complex
system, the approximations illuminate aspects of the system's nature by
restricting -- and monitoring -- the information about different components
incorporated into the approximation. We demonstrate the Distributed IB's
explanatory utility in systems drawn from applied mathematics and condensed
matter physics. In the former, we deconstruct a Boolean circuit into
approximations that isolate the most informative subsets of input components
without requiring exhaustive search. In the latter, we localize information
about future plastic rearrangement in the static structure of a sheared glass,
and find the information to be more or less diffuse depending on the system's
preparation. By way of a principled scheme of approximations, the Distributed
IB brings much-needed interpretability to deep learning and enables

demonstrate that exact, non-perburbative results can be obtained for both
optical transport and static susceptibilities in ""Hertz-Millis"" theories of
Fermi surfaces coupled to critical bosons. Such models possess a large emergent
symmetry and anomaly structure, which we leverage to fix these quantities. In
particular, we show that in the infrared limit, the boson self energy at zero
wave vector, $\mathbf{q}=0$, is a constant independent of frequency, and the
real part of the optical conductivity, $\sigma(\omega)$, is purely a delta
function Drude peak with no other corrections. Therefore, further frequency
dependence in the boson self energy or optical conductivity can only come from
irrelevant operators in a clean system. Exact relations between Fermi liquid
parameters as the critical point is approached from the disordered phase are
also obtained. The absence of a universal, power law frequency dependence in
the boson self energy contrasts with previous perturbative calculations, and we
explain the origin of this difference.

estimates in a sample of 34 absorbers with HI column densities between 15.25 <
log ($\mathrm{N_{HI}}$ / $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) < 17.25 and measured metal ion

changes in the EUV power-law slope of active galactic nuclei,
$\mathrm{\alpha_{EUVB}}$, at low redshift (z < 1), showing derived absorber
metallicities increase on average by approximately 0.3 dex as the EUV slope is
hardened from $\mathrm{\alpha_{EUVB}}$ = -2.0 to -1.4. We use Markov Chain
Monte Carlo sampling of photoionization models with $\mathrm{\alpha_{EUVB}}$ as
a free parameter to derive metallicities for these absorbers. The current
sample of absorbers does not provide a robust constraint on the slope,
$\mathrm{\alpha_{EUVB}}$, itself; we discuss how future analyses may provide
stronger constraints. Marginalizing over the uncertainty in the slope of the
background, we find the average uncertainties in the metallicity determinations
increase from 0.08 dex to 0.14 dex when switching from a fixed EUVB slope to
one that freely varies. Thus, we demonstrate that EUVB uncertainties can be
included in ionization models while still allowing for robust metallicity
inferences.

that the most likely cause is a refreshed shock in the jet. The prompt emission
of the GRB is within the range of typical long bursts: it shows three disjoint
emission episodes, which all follow the typical GRB correlations. This suggests
that GRB 210204A might not have any special properties that caused late-time
flaring, and the lack of such detections for other afterglows might be
resulting from the paucity of late-time observations. Systematic late-time
follow-up of a larger sample of GRBs can shed more light on such afterglow
behaviour. Further analysis of the GRB 210204A shows that the late time bump in
the light curve is highly unlikely due to underlying SNe at redshift (z) =
0.876 and is more likely due to the late time flaring activity. The cause of
this variability is not clearly quantifiable due to the lack of multi-band data
at late time constraints by the bad weather conditions. The flare of GRB

quantum cosmology (LQC) based on holonomies and triads obtained from
gauge-fixing fluxes, and a modification of LQC based on holonomies and
gauge-covariant fluxes (referred to as gLQC). Both the models yield singularity
resolution via a bounce because of non-perturbative quantum geometric effects
resulting in a maximum for energy density. In LQC, the bounce is extremely well
captured by a $\rho^2$ term in energy density with a negative sign which
emerges as a non-perturbative modification to the classical Friedmann and
Raychaudhuri equations. But, details of such modifications in gLQC have
remained hidden due to an arduous nature of gauge-covariant flux modifications
which do not allow writing above equations in a closed form. To extract these
modifications we explore the large volume, weak curvature limit for matter with
a fixed equation of state and obtain higher order corrections to the classical
theory. We find that in the weak curvature limit of gLQC, in the post-bounce
branch, the first order correction beyond classical theory fully recovers the
form of modified Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations of LQC. In contrast, due
to an asymmetric bounce in gLQC, the weak curvature limit of the pre-bounce
branch exhibits a novel structure with a $\rho^{3/2}$ term as a first order
correction beyond classical theory while the $\rho^2$ term appears as a second
order correction. Our work shows that gLQC has a far richer structure which
includes the form of dynamical equations with non-perturbative modifications in
LQC in its weak curvature limit. This indicates that more general loop
quantizations of cosmological sectors can reveal LQC at some truncation, and
possibly there exist a tower of potentially interesting higher order
modifications from quantum geometry which are hidden in the setting of LQC.

which includes the GW signal-to-noise ratio, the kilonova (KN) optical and
near-infrared light curves, the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt
emission peak photon flux, and the afterglow light curves in radio, optical and
X-rays. Within our assumptions, the rate of GW events to be confidently
detected during O4 is $7.7^{+11.9}_{-5.7}$ yr$^{-1}$ (calendar year), 78% of
which will produce a KN, and a lower 52% will also produce a relativistic jet.
The typical depth of current optical electromagnetic search and follow up
strategies is still sufficient to detect most of the KNe in O4, but only for
the first night or two. The prospects for detecting relativistic jet emission
are not promising. While closer events (within z<0.02) will likely still have a
detectable cocoon shock breakout, most events will have their GRB emission
(both prompt and afterglow) missed unless seen under a favorably small viewing
angle. This reduces the fraction of events with detectable jets to 2% (prompt
emission, serendipitous) and 10% (afterglow, deep radio monitoring),
corresponding to detection rates of $0.17^{+0.26}_{-0.13}$ and
$0.78^{+1.21}_{-0.58}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. When considering a GW
sub-threshold search triggered by a GRB detection, our predicted rate of GW+GRB
prompt emission detections increases up to a more promising
$0.75^{+1.16}_{-0.55}$ yr$^{-1}$.

maximum vertical height |zmax| above the Galactic plane computed assuming the
relation between the vertical action and stellar age in thin disc stars. The
predicted vertical distribution of the [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio is in agreement
with the one observed combining the APOGEE DR16 data and the astroNN catalogue

low-$\alpha$ sequence stars). Including the high-$\alpha$ disc component, the
dichotomy in the vertical [Mg/Fe] abundance distribution is reproduced

However, our model predicts a too flat growth of the |zmax| as a function of
[Mg/Fe] for high-$\alpha$ objects in contrast with the median values from
APOGEE data. Possible explanations for such a tension are: i) the data sample
with |z| < 2 kpc is more likely contaminated by halo stars, causing the median
values to be kinematically hotter, ii) external perturbations such as minor
mergers could have heated up the disc, and the heating of the orbits cannot be
modelled by only scattering processes. Assuming for the data a disc dissection
based on chemistry, the observed |zmax| distributions for high-$\alpha$ and
low-$\alpha$ sequences are in good agreement with our model predictions if we

then turn to a drive which closes the gap, resulting in an enhanced energy
absorption. While the TGVA approach breaks down in this regime, we can apply
TWA to explore the dynamics of the mode-resolved energy density, and the
higher-order correlations between modes in the prethermal heating regime. For
weak driving amplitude, we find an exponentially fast energy absorption in the
main resonant mode, while the heating of all remaining modes is almost
perfectly suppressed on short time scales. At later times, the highly excited
main resonance provides effective resonant driving terms for its higher
harmonics through the non-linearities in the Hamiltonian, and gives rise to an
exponentially fast heating in these particular modes. We capture the strong
correlations induced by these resonant processes by evaluating higher order
connected correlation functions. Our results can be experimentally probed in
ultracold atomic settings, with parallel one-dimensional quasi-condensates in
the presence of a modulated tunnel coupling.

non-trivial interplay between the symmetric and asymmetric magnetic
interactions, which can only reach equilibrium in a noncollinear magnetic
configuration. Consequently, the associated electronic interactions and their
possible tuning by external constraints, such as applied epitaxial strain, play
a crucial role in defining the microscopic and macroscopic properties of such
topological condensed matter systems. Thus, in the present work, we explored
and explained the effect of the epitaxial strain imposed within the
(111)-plane, in which the magnetic and crystallographic symmetry operations are
kept fixed, and only the magnitude of the ionic and electronic interactions are
tuned. We found a linear shifting in the energy of the band structure and a
linear increase/decrease of the available states near the Fermi level with the
applied strain. Concretely, the compression strain reduces the Mn-Mn distances
in the (111) kagome plane but linearly increases the separation between the
stacked kagome lattices and the available states near the Fermi level. Despite
the linear controlling of the available states across the Fermi energy, the
anomalous Hall conductivity shows a non-linear behavior where the
$\sigma_{111}$ conductivity nearly vanishes for tensile strain. On the other
hand, $\sigma_{111}$ fetches a maximum increase of 26\% about the unstrained

potential of UEs' processing power. We derive convergence rates for the
proposed schemes to quantify their training efficiency. The analyses reveal
that when the interference obeys a Gaussian distribution, the proposed
algorithm retrieves the convergence rate of a server-based FL. But if the
interference distribution is heavy-tailed, then the heavier the tail, the
slower the algorithm converges. Nonetheless, the system run time can be largely
reduced by enabling computation in parallel with communication, whereas the
gain is particularly pronounced when communication latency is high. These
findings are corroborated via excessive simulations.

Issues with methodology and not properly accounting for variation introduced by
the algorithm themselves or their implementations are attributed as the main
contributors to the irreproducibility.Problem: There exist no theoretical
framework that relates experiment design choices to potential effects on the
conclusions. Without such a framework, it is much harder for practitioners and
researchers to evaluate experiment results and describe the limitations of
experiments. The lack of such a framework also makes it harder for independent
researchers to systematically attribute the causes of failed reproducibility
experiments. Objective: The objective of this paper is to develop a framework
that enable applied data science practitioners and researchers to understand
which experiment design choices can lead to false findings and how and by this
help in analyzing the conclusions of reproducibility experiments. Method: We
have compiled an extensive list of factors reported in the literature that can
lead to machine learning studies being irreproducible. These factors are
organized and categorized in a reproducibility framework motivated by the
stages of the scientific method. The factors are analyzed for how they can
affect the conclusions drawn from experiments. A model comparison study is used
as an example. Conclusion: We provide a framework that describes machine

which leverages standard-compliant beamforming feedback matrices to
authenticate MU-MIMO Wi-Fi devices on the move. By capturing unique
imperfections in off-the-shelf radio circuitry, RFP techniques can identify
wireless devices directly at the physical layer, allowing low-latency
low-energy cryptography-free authentication. However, existing Wi-Fi RFP
techniques are based on software-defined radio (SDRs), which may ultimately
prevent their widespread adoption. Moreover, it is unclear whether existing
strategies can work in the presence of MU-MIMO transmitters - a key technology
in modern Wi-Fi standards. Conversely from prior work, DeepCSI does not require
SDR technologies and can be run on any low-cost Wi-Fi device to authenticate
MU-MIMO transmitters. Our key intuition is that imperfections in the
transmitter's radio circuitry percolate onto the beamforming feedback matrix,
and thus RFP can be performed without explicit channel state information (CSI)
computation. DeepCSI is robust to inter-stream and inter-user interference
being the beamforming feedback not affected by those phenomena. We extensively
evaluate the performance of DeepCSI through a massive data collection campaign
performed in the wild with off-the-shelf equipment, where 10 MU-MIMO Wi-Fi
radios emit signals in different positions. Experimental results indicate that
DeepCSI correctly identifies the transmitter with an accuracy of up to 98%. The
identification accuracy remains above 82% when the device moves within the
environment. To allow replicability and provide a performance benchmark, we
pledge to share the 800 GB datasets - collected in static and, for the first

Neural architecture search (NAS) for tabular datasets is an important but

spaces incorporate resource constraints directly into the reinforcement
learning (RL) rewards. However, for NAS on tabular datasets, this protocol
often discovers suboptimal architectures. This paper develops TabNAS, a new and
more effective approach to handle resource constraints in tabular NAS using an
RL controller motivated by the idea of rejection sampling. TabNAS immediately
discards any architecture that violates the resource constraints without
training or learning from that architecture. TabNAS uses a Monte-Carlo-based
correction to the RL policy gradient update to account for this extra filtering

over previous reward-shaping methods: it finds better models that obey the

AV be examined purely virtually, allowing large numbers of fully controllable

ground? Since different test setups have different strengths and weaknesses, it
is still an open question how virtual and real tests should be combined. On the

concepts of transfer learning and importance sampling, TIS uses a scalable,
cost-effective test setup to comprehensively explore an AV's behavior. The
insights gained then allow parameterizing tests in a more trustworthy test

increase efficiency $\unicode{x2013}$ without sacrificing the result's
validity. Thus, the test setups' individual deficiencies are compensated for by
their systematic linkage.

Here, we analyze a sample of 164 spectroscopically-characterized ultracool
dwarfs identified by Aganze et al. (2022) in the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3
Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) Survey and 3D-HST. We model the observed
luminosity function using population simulations to place constraints on
scaleheights, vertical velocity dispersions and population ages as a function
of spectral type. Our star counts are consistent with a power-law mass function
and constant star formation history for ultracool dwarfs, with vertical
scaleheights 249$_{-61}^{+48}$ pc for late M dwarfs, 153$_{-30}^{+56}$ pc for L
dwarfs, and 175$_{-56}^{+149}$ pc for T dwarfs. Using spatial and velocity
dispersion relations, these scaleheights correspond to disk population ages of
3.6$_{-1.0}^{+0.8}$ for late M dwarfs, 2.1$_{-0.5}^{+0.9}$ Gyr for L dwarfs,
and 2.4$_{-0.8}^{+2.4}$ Gyr for T dwarfs, which are consistent with prior
simulations that predict that L-type dwarfs are on average a younger and less
dispersed population. There is an additional 1-2 Gyr systematic uncertainty on
these ages due to variances in age-velocity relations. We use our population
simulations to predict the UCD yield in the JWST PASSAGES survey, a similar and

Galactic halo field RRL with homogeneous spectroscopic metallicities. Our
relations are defined in the optical (ASAS-SN $V$-band) and, inaugurally, in
the infrared (WISE $W1$ and $W2$ bands). Our $V$-band relation can reproduce
individual RRc spectroscopic metallicities with a dispersion of 0.30 dex over
the entire metallicity range of our calibrator sample (an RMS smaller than what
we found for other relations in literature including non-linear terms). Our
infrared relation has a similar dispersion in the low and intermediate

[Fe/H] abundance around solar metallicity. We tested our relations by measuring
both the metallicity of the Sculptor dSph and a sample of Galactic globular
clusters, rich in both RRc and RRab stars. The average metallicity we obtain
for the combined RRL sample in each cluster is within $\pm 0.08$ dex of their
spectroscopic metallicities. The infrared and optical relations presented in
this work will enable deriving reliable photometric RRL metallicities in
conditions where spectroscopic measurements are not feasible; e.g., in distant

a direct path). We ask (1) when is non-brute-force navigation possible?; (2) do
shortcuts exist and what are their properties?; and (3) what heuristics predict

non-brute-force navigation is only possible between some state pairs, (2)

effects of corrective and randomly-sampled additional demonstrations on
learning a policy that guides a five-fingered robot hand through a

considerably outperform randomly-sampled demonstrations, when the proportion of
additional demonstrations sampled from the full task distribution is larger
than the number of original demonstrations sampled from a restrictive training

results provide insights into the inherent trade-off between the effort
required to collect corrective demonstrations and their relative benefits over

motion in videos. There are basically two main approaches to reach this goal,
namely via Eulerian or Lagrangian techniques. While the first one magnifies
motion implicitly by operating directly on image pixels, the Lagrangian
approach uses optical flow techniques to extract and amplify pixel
trajectories. Microexpressions are fast and spatially small facial expressions
that are difficult to detect. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
local Lagrangian motion magnification of facial micromovements. Our
contribution is three-fold: first, we fine-tune the recurrent all-pairs field
transforms for optical flows (RAFT) deep learning approach for faces by adding
ground truth obtained from the variational dense inverse search (DIS) for
optical flow algorithm applied to the CASME II video set of faces. This enables
us to produce optical flows of facial videos in an efficient and sufficiently
accurate way. Second, since facial micromovements are both local in space and
time, we propose to approximate the optical flow field by sparse components
both in space and time leading to a double sparse decomposition. Third, we use
this decomposition to magnify micro-motions in specific areas of the face,
where we introduce a new forward warping strategy using a triangular splitting
of the image grid and barycentric interpolation of the RGB vectors at the
corners of the transformed triangles. We demonstrate the very good performance

the permutation-based $(1+1)$ EA proposed by Scharnow, Tinnefeld, and Wegener

the Hamming distance that determines how difficult it is to mutate a
permutation $\sigma$ into another one $\tau$, but also the precise cycle
structure of $\sigma \tau^{-1}$. For this reason, we also regard the more
symmetric scramble mutation operator. We observe that it not only leads to
simpler proofs, but also reduces the runtime on jump functions with odd jump
size by a factor of $\Theta(n)$. Finally, we show that a heavy-tailed version
of the scramble operator, as in the bit-string case, leads to a speed-up of

computational design algorithms assist designers by generating design examples

methods for assistance, on the other hand, can work with any design problem.
However, virtually all empirical studies of this human-in-the-loop approach
have been carried out by either researchers or end-users. The question stands
out if such methods can help designers in realistic tasks. In this paper, we
study Bayesian optimization as an algorithmic method to guide the design
optimization process. It operates by proposing to a designer which design
candidate to try next, given previous observations. We report observations from
a comparative study with 40 novice designers who were tasked to optimize a
complex 3D touch interaction technique. The optimizer helped designers explore
larger proportions of the design space and arrive at a better solution, however
they reported lower agency and expressiveness. Designers guided by an optimizer
reported lower mental effort but also felt less creative and less in charge of
the progress. We conclude that human-in-the-loop optimization can support
novice designers in cases where agency is not critical.

stellarator has the potential to reduce or eliminate the need for non-planar
coils. As a proof-of-concept for this idea, we have developed a procedure for
designing an array of cubic permanent magnets that works in tandem with a set
of toroidal-field coils to confine a stellarator plasma. All of the magnets in
the design are constrained to have identical geometry and one of three
polarization types in order to simplify fabrication while still producing
sufficient field accuracy. We present some of the key steps leading to the
design, including the geometric arrangement of the magnets around the device,
the procedure for optimizing the polarizations according to the three allowable
magnet types, and the choice of magnet types to be used. We apply these methods
to design an array of rare-Earth permanent magnets that can be paired with a
set of planar toroidal-field coils to confine a quasi-axisymmetric plasma with
a toroidal magnetic field strength of about 0.5 T on axis.

revealing more fine details in the associated painting. Our experiments show
that neural speakers trained on the new dataset improve CIDEr and METEOR

creative product as partners. In a creative collaboration, interaction
dynamics, such as turn-taking, contribution type, and communication, are the
driving forces of the co-creative process. Therefore the interaction model is a
critical and essential component for effective co-creative systems. There is
relatively little research about interaction design in the co-creativity field,
which is reflected in a lack of focus on interaction design in many existing
co-creative systems. The primary focus of co-creativity research has been on
the abilities of the AI. This paper focuses on the importance of interaction
design in co-creative systems with the development of the Co-Creative Framework
for Interaction design (COFI) that describes the broad scope of possibilities
for interaction design in co-creative systems. Researchers can use COFI for
modeling interaction in co-creative systems by exploring alternatives in this
design space of interaction. COFI can also be beneficial while investigating
and interpreting the interaction design of existing co-creative systems. We
coded a dataset of existing 92 co-creative systems using COFI and analyzed the
data to show how COFI provides a basis to categorize the interaction models of
existing co-creative systems. We identify opportunities to shift the focus of
interaction models in co-creativity to enable more communication between the

increasingly crucial with their wide adoption in real-world products. Yet
applying differential privacy (DP), a canonical notion with provable privacy
guarantees for machine learning models, to those models remains challenging due
to the trade-off between model utility and privacy loss. Utilizing the fact
that sensitive information in language data tends to be sparse, Shi et al.
(2021) formalized a DP notion extension called Selective Differential Privacy
(SDP) to protect only the sensitive tokens defined by a policy function.
However, their algorithm only works for RNN-based models. In this paper, we
develop a novel framework, Just Fine-tune Twice (JFT), that achieves SDP for
state-of-the-art large transformer-based models. Our method is easy to
implement: it first fine-tunes the model with redacted in-domain data, and then
fine-tunes it again with the original in-domain data using a private training
mechanism. Furthermore, we study the scenario of imperfect implementation of
policy functions that misses sensitive tokens and develop systematic methods to
handle it. Experiments show that our method achieves strong utility compared to
previous baselines. We also analyze the SDP privacy guarantee empirically with
the canary insertion attack.

certain unnormalized estimators have the advantage of being based on a
denominator that is bounded away from zero. To reconcile these findings, we
demonstrate that when the instrument propensity score is estimated using an

also shares this advantage. We use a simulation study and three empirical
applications to illustrate our findings. In two cases, the unnormalized

non-magnetic, photometrically stable hot white dwarfs (WD) located at $\sim$
kpc distances may be optimal targets for this approach. Previous studies of
astrometric GW detection have focused on the potential for less precise surveys
of large numbers of stars; our work provides an alternative optimization
approach to this problem. Interesting GW sources in this band are expected at
characteristic strains around $h_c \sim 10^{-17} \times
\left(\mu\text{Hz}/f_{\text{GW}}\right)$. The astrometric angular precision
required to see these sources is $\Delta \theta \sim h_c$ after integrating for
a time $T \sim 1/f_{\text{GW}}$. We show that jitter in the photometric center
of WD of this type due to starspots is bounded to be small enough to permit
this high-precision, small-$N$ approach. We discuss possible noise arising from
stellar reflex motion induced by orbiting objects and show how it can be
mitigated. The only plausible technology able to achieve the requisite
astrometric precision is a space-based stellar interferometer. Such a future
mission with few-meter-scale collecting dishes and baselines of
$\mathcal{O}(100\text{ km})$ is sufficient to achieve the target precision.
This collector size is broadly in line with the collectors proposed for some
formation-flown, space-based astrometer or optical synthetic-aperture
imaging-array concepts proposed for other science reasons. The proposed
baseline is however somewhat larger than the km-scale baselines discussed for
those concepts, but we see no fundamental technical obstacle to utilizing such

understand this stochastic acceleration, we have implemented novel
magnetohydrodynamic(MHD)-particle-in-cell(PIC) methods into the astrophysical

that experience aerodynamic drag and Lorentz force. We subject our code to a
range of numerical tests designed to validate our method in different physical

accelerated. As a final test as well as a foundation for future work, we
present the results of decaying dusty MHD turbulence simulations with grain
parameters chosen to resemble 1-2 $\mu$m grains in typical cold neutral medium
conditions. We find that in these conditions, these grains can be effectively
accelerated to well beyond their shattering velocities. This is true for both
electrically charged and neutral grains. While the peak of the gas-grain
relative drift velocity distribution is higher for neutral grains, the drift
velocity distribution of charged grains exhibits an extended exponential tail
out to much greater velocities. Even so, the shapes of the distributions are
such that the extra gas-grain coupling provided by the Lorentz force offers
grains relative protection from shattering. We also discuss the connection

associates data sets with distrust quantification that specifies their scope of

necessary components of the measures from the data itself and are sublinear,
which makes them scalable to very large and multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, an estimator is designed to enable no-data access during the query
time. Besides theoretical analyses, the algorithms are evaluated
experimentally, using multiple real and synthetic data sets and different

predictions of perturbed target domain data to refine the model. Since the

But droplets on collision courses do not always coalesce due to the cushioning
effects of the air between them. The extent to which these so-called
hydrodynamic interactions reduce coalescence rates is embodied in the collision
efficiency, which is often small and is not generally known. In order to
characterize the mechanisms that determine the collision efficiency, we
exploited new time-resolved three-dimensional droplet tracking techniques to
measure the positions of cloud droplet pairs settling through quiescent air. We
did so with an unprecedented precision that enabled us to calculate the
relative positions, velocities, and accelerations of the droplets at droplet
surface-to-surface separations as small as about one-tenth of a droplet
diameter. We show that relative accelerations clearly distinguish coalescing
from non-coalescing droplet trajectories, the former being associated with
relative accelerations that exceeded a threshold value. We outline how relative
accelerations relate to hydrodynamic interactions, and present scaling
arguments that predict the threshold relative acceleration. We speculate that
the relative acceleration distribution of droplets in turbulent clouds can
parameterize the collision efficiency, and that this distribution together with
the well-known relative position and velocity distributions can generate a
physical description of both the collision and coalescence rates of cloud
droplets.

Matter Physics (CMP) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT). The unifying formalism is
based on being able to expand any quantum operator, for bosons, fermions, and
spin systems, using a universal basis operator Y(u,v) involving mixed Hilbert
spaces of P and Q, respectively, where P and Q are momentum and position
operators in CMP (which can be considered as a bozonization of free Bloch
electrons which incorporates the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac
distribution), whereas these are related to the creation and annihilation
operators in QFT, where {\psi}^{{\dag}}=-iP and {\psi}=Q. The expansion
coefficient is the Fourier transform of the Wigner quantum distribution
function (lattice Weyl transform) otherwise known as the characteristic
distribution function. Thus, in principle, fermionization via Jordan-Wigner for
spin systems, as well as the Holstein--Primakoff transformation from boson to
the spin operators can be performed depending on the ease of the calculations.
Unitary transformation on the creation and annihilation operators themselves is
also employed, as exemplified by the Bogoliubov transformation. Moreover,
whenever Y(u,v) is already expressed in matrix form, M_{ij}, e.g. the Pauli
spin matrices, the Jordan--Schwinger transformation is a map to bilinear
expressions of creation and annihilation operators which expedites computation
of representations. We show that the well-known coherent states formulation of
quantum physics is a special case of the present unification. A new formulation
of QFT based on Q-distribution of functional-field variables is suggested. The
case of nonequilibrium quantum transport physics, which not only involves
non-Hermitian operators but also time-reversal symmetry breaking, is discussed
in the Appendix.

framework is proposed, inspired by vector quantized compressed sensing. The
basic strategy of the proposed framework is to compress the local model update
at each device by applying dimensionality reduction followed by vector
quantization. Subsequently, the global model update is reconstructed at a
parameter server by applying a sparse signal recovery algorithm to the
aggregation of the compressed local model updates. By harnessing the benefits
of both dimensionality reduction and vector quantization, the proposed
framework effectively reduces the communication overhead of local update
transmissions. Both the design of the vector quantizer and the key parameters
for the compression are optimized so as to minimize the reconstruction error of
the global model update under the constraint of wireless link capacity. By
considering the reconstruction error, the convergence rate of the proposed
framework is also analyzed for a non-convex loss function. Simulation results
on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
provides more than a 2.5% increase in classification accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art FL frameworks when the communication overhead of the local
model update transmission is less than 0.1 bit per local model entry.

We hypothesize that in doing so, users will be better able to predict when the

studies, we verify that exposing the decomposition probes and answers to the
probes to users can increase their ability to predict system performance on a

boundaries. We consider the cases that the endpoints of the string are static
and that the endpoints are uniformly accelerated in opposite directions where
the exact solutions for the string's profiles are available. In both cases, the
two-point correlators of the boundary field, described by the linearized
perturbations in the worldsheet, can also be derived exactly where we obtain
the all-time evolution of the correlators. In the case of the accelerating
string, the induced geometry on the string worldsheet has the causal structure
of a two-sided AdS black hole with a wormhole connecting two causally
disconnected boundaries, which can be a realization of the ER=EPR conjecture.
We find that causality plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the
dispersion relation of the particle and the feature of the induced mutual
interaction between two particles from the field. In the case that two
boundaries of the worldsheet are causally disconnected, the induced effect from
the field gives the dissipative dynamics of each particle with no dependence on
the distance between two particles, and the induced mutual coupling between
them vanishes in the late times, following a power law. When two ends are
causally connected, the induced dispersion relation becomes non-dissipative in
the late times. Here, we will also comment on the implications of our findings
to the entangled particle dynamics and the ER=EPR conjecture.

transfer system improves upon current state-of-art systems by 21\% on human
evaluation and 12\% on automatic evaluation. Upon ablated comparison with the
current reward shaping approach (the `roll-out strategy'), using dense rewards
improves the overall style transfer quality by 22\% based on human evaluation.

find that the sensitivity of the Rabi interferometer is independent of the
thermal occupation of the oscillator mode, and thus cooling it to the ground
state before sensing is not required. We also perform a thorough investigation
of the effect of qubit dephasing and oscillator thermalization. We find the

Super-NaturalInstructions, a benchmark of 1,616 diverse NLP tasks and their
expert-written instructions. Our collection covers 76 distinct task types,
including but not limited to classification, extraction, infilling, sequence
tagging, text rewriting, and text composition. This large and diverse
collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of cross-task generalization
under instructions -- training models to follow instructions on a subset of
tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones. Furthermore, we build
Tk-Instruct, a transformer model trained to follow a variety of in-context
instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples). Our
experiments show that Tk-Instruct outperforms existing instruction-following
models such as InstructGPT by over 9% on our benchmark despite being an order
of magnitude smaller. We further analyze generalization as a function of
various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of
instances per task, and model sizes. We hope our dataset and model facilitate
future progress towards more general-purpose NLP models.

that uses encrypted images and an isotropic network such as the vision
transformer. The proposed method allows us not only to apply images without

but also to maintain a high classification accuracy. In addition, compressible
encrypted images, called encryption-then-compression (EtC) images, can be used
for both training and testing without any adaptation network. Previously, to
classify EtC images, an adaptation network was required before a classification
network, so methods with an adaptation network have been only tested on small
images. To the best of our knowledge, previous privacy-preserving image
classification methods have never considered image compressibility and patch
embedding-based isotropic networks. In an experiment, the proposed
privacy-preserving image classification was demonstrated to outperform
state-of-the-art methods even when EtC images were used in terms of
classification accuracy and robustness against various attacks under the use of
two isotropic networks: vision transformer and ConvMixer.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) which helps to see unprecedented growth of connected

safety and providing low route information. One of the most important and major
requirements of the IoV is preserving security and privacy under strict
latency. Moreover, vehicles are required to be authenticated frequently and
fast considering limited bandwidth, high mobility, and density of the vehicles.
To address the security vulnerabilities and data integrity, an ultralight
authentication scheme has been proposed in this article. Physical Unclonable
Function (PUF) and XOR function are used to authenticate both server and
vehicle in two message flow which makes the proposed scheme ultralight, and
less computation is required. The proposed Easy-Sec can authenticate vehicles
maintaining low latency and resisting known security threats. Furthermore, the
proposed Easy-Sec needs low overhead so that it does not increase the burden of
the IoV network. Computational ( around 4 ms) and Communication (32 bytes)
overhead shows the feasibility, efficiency, and also security features are
depicted using formal analysis, Burrows, Abadi, and Needham (BAN) logic, and
informal analysis to show the robustness of the proposed mechanisms against

the dynamic motional cooling of a macroscopic magnonic sphere, and how it can
be uniformly extended for more complex systems, for example, a tripartite
opto-magno-mechanical system to obtain cooling of the motional mode below the
time bound of coherent cooling. While conventional sideband cooling methods do
not work beyond the well-known rotating wave approximation (RWA) regimes, our
proposed DRL scheme can be applied uniformly to regimes operating within and
beyond the RWA, and thus this offers a new and complete toolkit for rapid
control and generation of macroscopic quantum states for application in quantum

We use a slave-boson treatment of harmonic quantum fluctuations around the

an `approximation network' (AN) is proposed, which will improve the association
between the centre pixel and its neighbourhood. Hence, it will accentuate
spatial correlation in the abundances as its output is the input to the UN and
the reference for the `mixing network' (MN). In the Guided Encoder-Decoder
Architecture for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Spatial Smoothness (GAUSS), we
proposed using one-hot encoded abundances as the pseudo-ground truth to guide

methods. Furthermore, we release the single-layer constraint on MN by
introducing the UN generated abundances in contrast to the standard AE for HU.
Secondly, we experimented with two modifications on the pre-trained network
using the GAUSS method. In GAUSS$_\textit{blind}$, we have concatenated the UN
and the MN to back-propagate the reconstruction error gradients to the encoder.
Then, in the GAUSS$_\textit{prime}$, abundance results of a signal processing
(SP) method with reliable abundance results were used as the pseudo-ground
truth with the GAUSS architecture. According to quantitative and graphical
results for four experimental datasets, the three architectures either
transcended or equated the performance of existing HU algorithms from both DL

quantified in a periodically propelled Quincke system. The periodical coupling
between propulsion and repulsion at the particle level leads to local directed
oscillating particle flows and promises a loop of positive feedback to density
fluctuations. Nevertheless, the global evolution of the resulting cluster phase
is dominated by a global dual transformation. As stable attractors of the dual
transformation, self-dual patterns including stripe patterns and square
lattices can be achieved by tuning the strength and the frequency of
propelling. However, stripes are possible only at strong propelling where
boundary particle flows can form. The findings in this study show that the
dynamics of emergence on different length scales are controlled by different
mechanisms. The competition and the interplay between different microscopic
dynamic processes play the central role in determining the product of
emergence. Moreover, the periodically oscillating self-dual patterns
demonstrate a classical approach to time crystals.

application in community search (related to query nodes) brings in new
challenges. We address these challenges by designing a new graph modularity

selecting a source policy from an offline library by inferring the task belief
based on some observation signals and a trained observation model. In this
paper, we propose an improved BPR method to achieve more efficient policy
transfer in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, most BPR algorithms use
the episodic return as the observation signal that contains limited information
and cannot be obtained until the end of an episode. Instead, we employ the
state transition sample, which is informative and instantaneous, as the
observation signal for faster and more accurate task inference. Second, BPR
algorithms usually require numerous samples to estimate the probability
distribution of the tabular-based observation model, which may be expensive and
even infeasible to learn and maintain, especially when using the state
transition sample as the signal. Hence, we propose a scalable observation model
based on fitting state transition functions of source tasks from only a small
number of samples, which can generalize to any signals observed in the target
task. Moreover, we extend the offline-mode BPR to the continual learning
setting by expanding the scalable observation model in a plug-and-play fashion,
which can avoid negative transfer when faced with new unknown tasks.
Experimental results show that our method can consistently facilitate faster
and more efficient policy transfer.

  Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A thriving trend for domain adaptive segmentation endeavors to generate the
high-quality pseudo labels for target domain and retrain the segmentor on them.
Under this self-training paradigm, some competitive methods have sought to the
latent-space information, which establishes the feature centroids (a.k.a
prototypes) of the semantic classes and determines the pseudo label candidates
by their distances from these centroids. In this paper, we argue that the
latent space contains more information to be exploited thus taking one step
further to capitalize on it. Firstly, instead of merely using the source-domain
prototypes to determine the target pseudo labels as most of the traditional
methods do, we bidirectionally produce the target-domain prototypes to degrade
those source features which might be too hard or disturbed for the adaptation.
Secondly, existing attempts simply model each category as a single and
isotropic prototype while ignoring the variance of the feature distribution,
which could lead to the confusion of similar categories. To cope with this
issue, we propose to represent each category with multiple and anisotropic
prototypes via Gaussian Mixture Model, in order to fit the de facto
distribution of source domain and estimate the likelihood of target samples
based on the probability density. We apply our method on GTA5->Cityscapes and
Synthia->Cityscapes tasks and achieve 61.2 and 62.8 respectively in terms of
mean IoU, substantially outperforming other competitive self-training methods.
Noticeably, in some categories which severely suffer from the categorical
confusion such as ""truck"" and ""bus"", our method achieves 56.4 and 68.8

(MIMO) channel has sparse support in the spatial domain has motivated recent
compressed sensing (CS)-based mmWave channel estimation methods, where the
angles of arrivals (AoAs) and angles of departures (AoDs) are quantized using
angle dictionary matrices. However, the existing CS-based methods usually
obtain the estimation result through one-stage channel sounding that have two
limitations: (i) the requirement of large-dimensional dictionary and (ii)
unresolvable quantization error. These two drawbacks are irreconcilable;
improvement of the one implies deterioration of the other. To address these
challenges, we propose, in this paper, a two-stage method to estimate the AoAs
and AoDs of mmWave channels. In the proposed method, the channel estimation
task is divided into two stages, Stage I and Stage II. Specifically, in Stage
I, the AoAs are estimated by solving a multiple measurement vectors (MMV)
problem. In Stage II, based on the estimated AoAs, the receive sounders are
designed to estimate AoDs. The dimension of the angle dictionary in each stage
can be reduced, which in turn reduces the computational complexity
substantially. We then analyze the successful recovery probability (SRP) of the
proposed method, revealing the superiority of the proposed framework over the
existing one-stage CS-based methods. We further enhance the reconstruction
performance by performing resource allocation between the two stages. We also
overcome the unresolvable quantization error issue present in the prior
techniques by applying the atomic norm minimization method to each stage of the
proposed two-stage approach. The simulation results illustrate the
substantially improved performance with low complexity of the proposed

Specifically, we first project the token-level embeddings obtained by the

well-known cooperative effect is reproduced in elementary H-bonded systems with
different D and A atoms. That is, with the decreasing of intermolecular
distance, the D-H bond length first increases and then decreases, while the
H...A bond length decreases. On the contrary, when D and A are the same, as the
intermolecular distance decreases, the D-H bond length decreases without
increasing, which is referred to as the uncooperative effect. Further analyses
conclude that compared to cooperative H-bonded systems, uncooperative systems
at their respective equilibrium position have a larger core-valence bifurcation
(CVB) index (>0.022) and lower binding energies (<0.25 eV), showing a clear
linear inverse relationship related to H-bond strength. Therefore, the
intermolecular non-H-bonding interactions are predicted to reflect the
uncooperative characteristics, which is confirmed by high-precision ab initio
calculations. These findings provide a direction for the comprehensive
understanding of H-bonds.

increased transparency into one another's devices in a way that facilitated

collaborative practices for managing online safety and privacy within families

In the federated learning, the training data is distributed across multiple

There are several privacy attacks on deep learning (DL) models to get the
sensitive information by attackers. Therefore, the DL model itself should be
protected from the adversarial attack, especially for applications using

encryption-based model protection from the adversary collaborator. This paper
proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm for medical data

from localized hot plasma embedded in the chromospheric environment at the
height of 2--10 Mm above the photosphere and last for 3--10 minutes with
released magnetic energy in the range of $10^{27}-10^{28}$ erg. The heated
plasma is almost co-spatial with the regions where the heating rate per
particle is maximal. The 3D velocity field reveals a pair of converging flows
with velocities of tens of km s$^{-1}$ toward and outflows with velocities of
about 100 km s$^{-1}$ moving away from the hot plasma. These features support
that magnetic reconnection plays a critical role in heating the localized
chromospheric plasma to coronal temperature, giving rise to observed
microflares. The magnetic topology analysis further discloses that the
reconnection region is located near quasi-separators where both current density
and squashing factors are maximal although the specific topology may vary from
tether-cutting to fan-spine-like structure.

For this purpose, we present an integrated programmable Central Pattern
Generator (CPG) for the online generation of the reference joint trajectory of
a robotic system out of a library of desired periodic motions. The reference
trajectory is then followed by the lower-level controller of the robot. The
proposed CPG generates a smooth reference joint trajectory convergence to the
desired one while preserving the position and velocity joint limits of the
robot. The integrated programmable CPG consists of one novel bounded output
programmable oscillator. We design the programmable oscillator for encoding the
desired multidimensional periodic trajectory as a stable limit cycle. We also
use the state transformation method to ensure that the oscillator's output and
its first-time derivative preserve the joint position and velocity limits of
the robot. With the help of Lyapunov-based arguments, We prove that the
proposed CPG provides the global stability and convergence of the desired
trajectory. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated CPG for trajectory
generation is shown in a passive rehabilitation scenario on the Kuka iiwa robot

in reversed field pinch (RFP) plasmas, using the gyrokinetic integral eigenmode
equation. It was found that in RFP plasmas with hollow density profiles, an
increase in $k_\theta \rho_s$ increases the growth rate of the ion temperature
gradient (ITG). Comparing the results of regular and hollow plasma density
profile shows that the ITG mode under the hollow density profile is much harder
to be excited. For the impurities' effects, when the impurities' density
gradient is opposite to the primary ions, namely when $L_{ez}$ is negative,
impurities could enhance the instability. On the contrary, when $L_{ez}$ is
positive, the instability is stabilized. Regarding the trapped electron mode
(TEMs), the growth rate under the plasma with hollow density profile remained
minor than that for the standard density gradient. There exists a threshold of
$L_{ez}$. When $L_{ez}$ is less than this value, impurity destabilizes TEMs,
while as $L_{ez}$ is greater than this, impurity stabilizes TEMs. The effects
of $L_{ez}$ on TEM also depend on both the plasma density gradient and the
impurity species. In addition, the influence of collisionality on TEMs was also

area of Internet of Things (IoT) security. The principle is to exploit
knowledge from large quantities of continuously generated malware. Existing
algorithms practice available malware features for IoT devices and lack
real-time prediction behaviors. More research is thus required on malware
detection to cope with real-time misclassification of the input IoT data.
Motivated by this, in this paper we propose an adversarial self-supervised
architecture for detecting malware in IoT networks, SETTI, considering samples
of IoT network traffic that may not be labeled. In the SETTI architecture, we
design three self-supervised attack techniques, namely Self-MDS, GSelf-MDS and
ASelf-MDS. The Self-MDS method considers the IoT input data and the adversarial
sample generation in real-time. The GSelf-MDS builds a generative adversarial
network model to generate adversarial samples in the self-supervised structure.
Finally, ASelf-MDS utilizes three well-known perturbation sample techniques to
develop adversarial malware and inject it over the self-supervised
architecture. Also, we apply a defence method to mitigate these attacks, namely
adversarial self-supervised training to protect the malware detection
architecture against injecting the malicious samples. To validate the attack
and defence algorithms, we conduct experiments on two recent IoT datasets:
IoT23 and NBIoT. Comparison of the results shows that in the IoT23 dataset, the
Self-MDS method has the most damaging consequences from the attacker's point of
view by reducing the accuracy rate from 98% to 74%. In the NBIoT dataset, the
ASelf-MDS method is the most devastating algorithm that can plunge the accuracy
rate from 98% to 77%.

communication-computation impacts as an `iteration cost' and propose a
cost-aware causal FL algorithm~(FedCau) to tackle this problem. We propose an
iteration-termination method that trade-offs the training performance and
networking costs. We apply our approach when clients use the slotted-ALOHA, the
carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance~(CSMA/CA), and the
orthogonal frequency-division multiple access~(OFDMA) protocols. We show that,
given a total cost budget, the training performance degrades as either the
background communication traffic or the dimension of the training problem
increases. Our results demonstrate the importance of proactively designing
optimal cost-efficient stopping criteria to avoid unnecessary
communication-computation costs to achieve only a marginal FL training
improvement. We validate our method by training and testing FL over the MNIST
dataset. Finally, we apply our approach to existing communication efficient FL
methods from the literature, achieving further efficiency. We conclude that
cost-efficient stopping criteria are essential for the success of practical FL

evaluating subjects' mental states. However, the interpretation of multi-modal
EEG signals is challenging, as they suffer from poor signal-to-noise-ratio, are
highly subject-dependent, and are bound to the equipment and experimental setup
used, (i.e. domain). This leads to machine learning models often suffer from
poor generalization ability, where they perform significantly worse on
real-world data than on the exploited training data. Recent research heavily
focuses on cross-subject and cross-session transfer learning frameworks to
reduce domain calibration efforts for EEG signals. We argue that multi-source
learning via learning domain-invariant representations from multiple
data-sources is a viable alternative, as the available data from different EEG
data-source domains (e.g., subjects, sessions, experimental setups) grow
massively. We propose an adversarial inference approach to learn data-source
invariant representations in this context, enabling multi-source learning for
EEG-based brain-computer interfaces. We unify EEG recordings from different

learning approach in suppressing data-source-relevant information leakage by
35% while still achieving stable EEG-based emotion classification performance.

considerable communication resources. Conventional video compression causes
resolution reduction under limited bandwidth. Semantic video conferencing
maintains high resolution by transmitting some keypoints to represent motions
because the background is almost static, and the speakers do not change often.
However, the study on the impact of the transmission errors on keypoints is
limited. In this paper, we initially establish a basal semantic video
conferencing (SVC) network, which dramatically reduces transmission resources
while only losing detailed expressions. The transmission errors in SVC only
lead to a changed expression, whereas those in the conventional methods destroy
pixels directly. However, the conventional error detector, such as the cyclic
redundancy check, cannot reflect the degree of expression changes. To overcome
this issue, we develop an incremental redundancy hybrid automatic
repeat-request (IR-HARQ) framework for the varying channels (SVC-HARQ)
incorporating a novel semantic error detector. The SVC-HARQ has flexibility in
bit consumption and achieves good performance. In addition, SVC-CSI is designed
for channel state information (CSI) feedback to allocate the keypoint
transmission and enhance the performance dramatically. Simulation shows that
the proposed wireless semantic communication system can significantly improve
the transmission efficiency.This work has been submitted to the IEEE for

autonomous driving. Generally, depth prediction based on binocular stereo
matching and fusion of monocular image and laser point cloud are two mainstream
methods. However, the former usually suffers from overfitting while building
cost volume, and the latter has a limited generalization due to the lack of
geometric constraint. To solve these problems, we propose a novel multimodal
neural network, namely UAMD-Net, for dense depth completion based on fusion of
binocular stereo matching and the weak constrain from the sparse point clouds.
Specifically, the sparse point clouds are converted to sparse depth map and
sent to the multimodal feature encoder (MFE) with binocular image, constructing
a cross-modal cost volume. Then, it will be further processed by the multimodal
feature aggregator (MFA) and the depth regression layer. Furthermore, the
existing multimodal methods ignore the problem of modal dependence, that is,
the network will not work when a certain modal input has a problem. Therefore,
we propose a new training strategy called Modal-dropout which enables the
network to be adaptively trained with multiple modal inputs and inference with
specific modal inputs. Benefiting from the flexible network structure and
adaptive training method, our proposed network can realize unified training
under various modal input conditions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on
KITTI depth completion benchmark demonstrate that our method produces robust
results and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

communication (MC) systems inspired by animal olfaction. We focus on a
multi-user scenario where transmitters employ unique mixtures of different
types of signaling molecules to convey their messages to a central receiver,
which is equipped with an array comprising $R$ different types of receptors to
detect the emitted molecule mixtures. The hardware complexity of an MC system
employing \textit{orthogonal} molecule-receptor pairs would linearly scale with
the number of signaling molecule types $Q$ (i.e., $R=Q$). Natural olfaction
systems avoid such high complexity by employing arrays of
\textit{cross-reactive} receptors, where each type of molecule activates
multiple types of receptors and each type of receptor is predominantly
activated by multiple types of molecules albeit with different activation
strengths. For instance, the human olfactory system is believed to discriminate
several thousands of chemicals using only a few hundred receptor types, i.e.,
$Q\gg R$. Motivated by this observation, we first develop an end-to-end MC
channel model that accounts for the key properties of olfaction. Subsequently,
we formulate the molecule mixture recovery as a convex compressive sensing (CS)
problem which can be efficiently solved via available numerical solvers. Our
simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed CS problem for the
recovery of the molecular mixture signal and quantify the system performance
for various system parameters.

quadrature. Contrarily to the infinite line source model, there is currently no

established. Then, two new exact and integral-free analytical expressions are
proposed, along with two new first-order approximations. The new analytical
expressions proposed take the form of convergent power series involving no
recursive evaluations. It is shown that relative errors less than 1% can be
obtained with only a few summands. The convergence properties of the series,
their accuracy and the validity domain of the first-order approximations are

systems. Its objective is to accurately classify samples of known intents while
at the same time detecting those of open (unknown) intents. Existing methods
usually use outlier detection algorithms combined with K-class classifier to
detect open intents, where K represents the class number of known intents.
Different from them, in this paper, we consider another way without using
outlier detection algorithms. Specifically, we directly train a (K+1)-class
classifier for open intent classification, where the (K+1)-th class represents
open intents. To address the challenge that training a (K+1)-class classifier
with training samples of only K classes, we propose a deep model based on Soft
Labeling and Manifold Mixup (SLMM). In our method, soft labeling is used to
reshape the label distribution of the known intent samples, aiming at reducing
model's overconfident on known intents. Manifold mixup is used to generate
pseudo samples for open intents, aiming at well optimizing the decision
boundary of open intents. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art

limitations associated with image segmentation and mesh generation required by
traditional discretization methods. Indeed, we encode geometrical variability
through scalar landmarks, such as coordinates of points of interest. In
biomedical applications, these landmarks can be inexpensively processed from
clinical images. Our approach is non-intrusive and modular, as we select a
data-driven loss function. The latter can also be modified by considering
additional constraints, thus leveraging available physical knowledge. Our
approach can also accommodate a universal coordinate system, which supports the
USM-Net in learning the correspondence between points belonging to different
geometries, boosting prediction accuracy on unobserved geometries. Finally, we
present two numerical test cases in computational fluid dynamics involving
variable Reynolds numbers as well as computational domains of variable shape.
The results show that our method allows for inexpensive but accurate
approximations of velocity and pressure, avoiding computationally expensive
image segmentation, mesh generation, or re-training for every new instance of

the processing of the Reynolds stress tensor and (2) the coupling method
between the machine learning turbulence model and flow solver. The first
determines the form of predicting targets and the resulting physical
completeness and interpretability. The second determines the training process

the Reynolds stress processing issue, we perform the theoretical derivation to
extend the relevant tensor arguments of Reynolds stress in addition to the
strain rate and rotation rate. Then, the tensor representation theorem is
employed to give the complete irreducible invariants and integrity basis. In
addition, an adaptive regularization term is employed to enhance the
representation performance. For the coupling issue, an iterative coupling
data-driven turbulence modeling framework with consistent convergence is
proposed. The training data preparation, predicting target selection, and
computation platform are illustrated. The framework is then applied to a
canonical separated flow for verification. The mean flow results obtained by
coupling computation of the trained machine learning model and flow solver have
high consistency with the direct numerical simulation true values, which proves

Standard improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES) is unable to
correctly predict the separating reattaching flow due to its inability to
accurately resolve the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In this study, a shear
layer adapted subgrid length scale is applied to enhance the IDDES prediction
of the flow around a finite NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics)
0012 wing with leading edge horn ice. It is found that applying the new length
scale contributes to a more accurate prediction of the separated shear layer
(SSL). The reattachment occurs earlier as one moves towards either end of the
wing due to the downwash effect of the wing tip vortex or the influence of
end-wall flow. Consequently, the computed surface pressure distributions agree
well with the experimental measurements. In contrast, standard IDDES severely
elongates surface pressure plateaus. For instantaneous flow, the new length
scale helps correctly resolve the rollup and subsequent pairing of vortical
structures due to its small values in the initial SSL. The computed Strouhal
numbers of vortical motions are approximately 0.2 in the initial SSL based on
the vorticity thickness and 0.1 around the reattachment based on the separation
bubble length. Both frequencies increase when moving towards the wing tip due
to the downwash effect of the tip vortex. In comparison, the excessive eddy
viscosity levels from the standard IDDES severely delay the rollup of spanwise
structures and give rise to ""overcoherent"" structures.

  Sparse Matrices",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A High-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrix is frequently encountered in a
big data-related application like an e-commerce system or a social network
services system. To perform highly accurate representation learning on it is of
great significance owing to the great desire of extracting latent knowledge and
patterns from it. Latent factor analysis (LFA), which represents an HiDS matrix
by learning the low-rank embeddings based on its observed entries only, is one
of the most effective and efficient approaches to this issue. However, most
existing LFA-based models perform such embeddings on a HiDS matrix directly
without exploiting its hidden graph structures, thereby resulting in accuracy
loss. To address this issue, this paper proposes a graph-incorporated latent
factor analysis (GLFA) model. It adopts two-fold ideas: 1) a graph is
constructed for identifying the hidden high-order interaction (HOI) among nodes
described by an HiDS matrix, and 2) a recurrent LFA structure is carefully
designed with the incorporation of HOI, thereby improving the representa-tion
learning ability of a resultant model. Experimental results on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that GLFA outperforms six state-of-the-art models in
predicting the missing data of an HiDS matrix, which evidently supports its
strong representation learning ability to HiDS data.

big data-related applications. Latent factor analysis (LFA) is a typical
representation learning method that extracts useful yet latent knowledge from
HiDS matrices via low-rank approximation. Current LFA-based models mainly focus
on a single-metric representation, where the representation strategy designed
for the approximation Loss function, is fixed and exclusive. However,
real-world HiDS matrices are commonly heterogeneous and inclusive and have
diverse underlying patterns, such that a single-metric representation is most
likely to yield inferior performance. Motivated by this, we in this paper
propose a multi-metric latent factor (MMLF) model. Its main idea is two-fold:
1) two vector spaces and three Lp-norms are simultaneously employed to develop
six variants of LFA model, each of which resides in a unique metric
representation space, and 2) all the variants are ensembled with a tailored,
self-adaptive weighting strategy. As such, our proposed MMLF enjoys the merits
originated from a set of disparate metric spaces all at once, achieving the
comprehensive and unbiased representation of HiDS matrices. Theoretical study
guarantees that MMLF attains a performance gain. Extensive experiments on eight
real-world HiDS datasets, spanning a wide range of industrial and science
domains, verify that our MMLF significantly outperforms ten state-of-the-art,
shallow and deep counterparts.

Benefiting from the strong fitting ability of deep learning, paired data-driven
supervised BID method has obtained great progress. However, paired data are
usually synthesized by hand, and the realistic blurs are more complex than
synthetic ones, which makes the supervised methods inept at modeling realistic
blurs and hinders their real-world applications. As such, unsupervised deep BID
method without paired data offers certain advantages, but current methods still
suffer from some drawbacks, e.g., bulky model size, long inference time, and
strict image resolution and domain requirements. In this paper, we propose a
lightweight and real-time unsupervised BID baseline, termed Frequency-domain
Contrastive Loss Constrained Lightweight CycleGAN (shortly, FCL-GAN), with
attractive properties, i.e., no image domain limitation, no image resolution
limitation, 25x lighter than SOTA, and 5x faster than SOTA. To guarantee the
lightweight property and performance superiority, two new collaboration units
called lightweight domain conversion unit(LDCU) and parameter-free
frequency-domain contrastive unit(PFCU) are designed. LDCU mainly implements
inter-domain conversion in lightweight manner. PFCU further explores the
similarity measure, external difference and internal connection between the
blurred domain and sharp domain images in frequency domain, without involving
extra parameters. Extensive experiments on several image datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our FCL-GAN in terms of performance, model size and

produces considerable gains in performance with only a few epochs and few
images. In addition, FSL opens rapid retraining opportunities for
human-in-the-loop systems, where a radiologist can relabel false inferences,
and the model can be quickly retrained. We compare our retrained model
performance with existing FSL approaches in medical imaging that train and
evaluate models at once.

2.8x10^4 h, 5.4x10^5 h, and 1.9x10^6 h at initial radiance (or current

introduction of a dipolar molecular stabilizer, which serves two critical roles
simultaneously. First, it prevents the detrimental transformation and
decomposition of the alpha-phase FAPbI3 perovskite, by inhibiting the formation
of lead and iodide intermediates. Secondly, hysteresis-free device operation

suppressed ion migration in the emissive perovskite. The record-long PeLED
lifespans are encouraging, as they now satisfy the stability requirement for
commercial organic LEDs (OLEDs). These results remove the critical concern that

collaboratively learn a global model without centralizing client data. It is
difficult, if possible at all, for such a global model to commonly achieve
optimal performance for each individual client, due to the heterogeneity of
medical images from various scanners and patient demographics. This problem
becomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients
outside the FL with unseen distributions not presented during federated
training. To optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for
medical imaging tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both
\textit{Inside and Outside model Personalization in FL} (IOP-FL). Our inside
personalization uses a lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the
local adapted model for each client, by accumulating both the global gradients
for common knowledge and the local gradients for client-specific optimization.
Moreover, and importantly, the obtained local personalized models and the
global model can form a diverse and informative routing space to personalize an
adapted model for outside FL clients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing
scheme using the consistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically
incorporate the models, given the distribution information conveyed by the test

$\mathcal{F}_\psi$. In particular, the vectors in $\mathcal{F}_\varphi$ are
essentially monomials in $x$, $x^k$, while those in $\mathcal{F}_\psi$ are weak
derivatives of the Dirac delta distribution, $\delta^{(m)}(x)$, times some
normalization factor. We also show how bi-coherent states can be constructed
for these $\hat q$ and $\hat D$, both as convergent series of elements of
$\mathcal{F}_\varphi$ and $\mathcal{F}_\psi$, or using two different
displacement-like operators acting on the two vacua of the framework. Our
approach generalizes well known results for ordinary coherent states.

electro-hydrodynamics-based additive manufacturing (AM) technologies (E-jet
printing) is still performed by labor-intensive trial-and-error practices.
These practices have hindered the broad adoption of these technologies,
demanding a new paradigm of self-calibrating E-jet printing machines. To
address this need, we developed GPJet, an end-to-end physics-informed Bayesian
learning framework, and tested it on a virtual E-jet printing machine with
in-process jet monitoring capabilities. GPJet consists of three modules: a) the
Machine Vision module, b) the Physics-Based Modeling Module, and c) the Machine
Learning (ML) module. We demonstrate that the Machine Vision module can extract
high-fidelity jet features in real-time from video data using an automated
parallelized computer vision workflow. In addition, we show that the Machine
Vision module, combined with the Physics-based modeling module, can act as
closed-loop sensory feedback to the Machine Learning module of high- and
low-fidelity data. Powered by our data-centric approach, we demonstrate that
the online ML planner can actively learn the jet process dynamics using video
and physics with minimum experimental cost. GPJet brings us one step closer to
realizing the vision of intelligent AM machines that can efficiently search
complex process-structure-property landscapes and create optimized material
solutions for a wide range of applications at a fraction of the cost and speed.

may negatively impact society. There are many reasons behind a system being
biased. The bias can be due to the algorithm we are using for our problem or
may be due to the dataset we are using, having some features over-represented
in it. In the face detection system bias due to the dataset is majorly seen.
Sometimes models learn only features that are over-represented in data and
ignore rare features from data which results in being biased toward those
over-represented features. In real life, these biased systems are dangerous to
society. The proposed approach uses generative models which are best suited for
learning underlying features(latent variables) from the dataset and by using
these learned features models try to reduce the threats which are there due to
bias in the system. With the help of an algorithm, the bias present in the
dataset can be removed. And then we train models on two datasets and compare

and routine activities in the world. Recently researchers have explored the
large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) to perform various script
related tasks, such as story generation, temporal ordering of event, future
event prediction and so on. However, it's still not well studied in terms of
how well the PLMs capture the script knowledge. To answer this question, we
design three probing tasks: inclusive sub-event selection, starting sub-event
selection and temporal ordering to investigate the capabilities of PLMs with
and without fine-tuning. The three probing tasks can be further used to
automatically induce a script for each main event given all the possible
sub-events. Taking BERT as a case study, by analyzing its performance on script
induction as well as each individual probing task, we conclude that the
stereotypical temporal knowledge among the sub-events is well captured in BERT,
however the inclusive or starting sub-event knowledge is barely encoded.

  over Knowledge Graph","Published as a conference paper at COLING 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building query graphs from natural language questions is an important step in
complex question answering over knowledge graph (Complex KGQA). In general, a
question can be correctly answered if its query graph is built correctly and
the right answer is then retrieved by issuing the query graph against the KG.
Therefore, this paper focuses on query graph generation from natural language
questions. Existing approaches for query graph generation ignore the semantic
structure of a question, resulting in a large number of noisy query graph
candidates that undermine prediction accuracies. In this paper, we define six
semantic structures from common questions in KGQA and develop a novel
Structure-BERT to predict the semantic structure of a question. By doing so, we
can first filter out noisy candidate query graphs, and then rank the remaining
candidates with a BERT-based ranking model. Extensive experiments on two
popular benchmarks MetaQA and WebQuestionsSP (WSP) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method as compared to state-of-the-arts.

well as of other correlated materials presents a formidable challenge. Their
unusual evolution with doping, frequency, and temperature has frequently led to
non-Fermi-liquid (non-FL) interpretations. Optical conductivity is a major
challenge in this context. Here, the optical spectra of two archetypal
cuprates, underdoped HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta }$ and optimally-doped
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta }$, are interpreted based on the standard
Fermi liquid (FL) paradigm. At both dopings, perfect frequency-temperature FL
scaling is found to be modified by the presence of a second, gapped electronic
subsystem. This non-FL component emerges as a well-defined mid-infrared
spectral feature after the FL contribution -- determined independently by
transport -- is subtracted. Temperature, frequency, and doping evolution of the
MIR feature identify a gapped rather than dissipative response. In contrast,
the dissipative response is found to be relevant for pnictides and ruthenates.
Such an unbiased FL/non-FL separation is extended across the cuprate phase
diagram, capturing all the key features of the normal state and providing a
natural explanation why the superfluid density is attenuated on the overdoped
side. Thus, we obtain a unified interpretation of optical responses and
transport measurements in all analyzed physical regimes and all analyzed
compounds.

prediction (ZSLP) which aims to predict unobserved relations in KGs has
attracted recent interest from researchers. A common solution is to use textual
features of relations (e.g., surface name or textual descriptions) as auxiliary
information to bridge the gap between seen and unseen relations. Current
approaches learn an embedding for each word token in the text. These methods
lack robustness as they suffer from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem.
Meanwhile, models built on character n-grams have the capability of generating
expressive representations for OOV words. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical N-Gram framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (HNZSLP), which
considers the dependencies among character n-grams of the relation surface name
for ZSLP. Our approach works by first constructing a hierarchical n-gram graph
on the surface name to model the organizational structure of n-grams that leads
to the surface name. A GramTransformer, based on the Transformer is then
presented to model the hierarchical n-gram graph to construct the relation
embedding for ZSLP. Experimental results show the proposed HNZSLP achieved
state-of-the-art performance on two ZSLP datasets.

measure the drainage forces (approach and retraction) in silicone oil. We
compare the drainage force measured between two smooth PMMA surfaces with the
one measure when one of the two surfaces has a structure with channels. We have
observed that the presence of channels reduces the hydrodynamic drainage forces
when the surfaces come together and reduces the adhesion when the surfaces are
pulled apart. Our force measurements were compared to Reynolds theory and we
discuss the possible role of elastohydrodynamic deformation in tree frog
adhesion.

more accurate knowledge about the future available bandwidth. Because with such
knowledge, one is able to know what sizes should he encode the frames to be in
an ever-changing network. Researchers have developed some algorithms to predict
throughputs in the literature, from where some are simple hence practical.
However, limitation remains as most current bandwidth prediction methods are
predicting a value, or a point estimate, of future bandwidth. Because in many
practical scenarios, it is desirable to control the performance to some
targets, e.g., video delivery rate over a given target percentage, which cannot
be easily achieved via most current methods.
  In this work, we propose the use of probability distribution to model future
bandwidth. Specifically, we model future bandwidth using past data transfer
measurements and then derive a probability model for use in the application.
This changes the selection of parameters in application into a probabilistic
manner such that given target performance can be achieved in the long run.
Inside our model, we use the conditional-probability method to correlate past
and future bandwidth and hence further improve the estimating performance.
