emergence of novel states of matter across many classes of strongly correlated
electron materials. A model example is unconventional superconductivity, which
is widely believed to arise from the coupling of electrons via spin
excitations. In cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the interplay of
charge and spin degrees of freedom is also reflected in a zoo of charge and
spin-density wave orders that are intertwined with superconductivity. A key
question is whether the different types of density waves merely coexist or are
indeed directly coupled. Here we use a novel neutron diffraction technique with
superior beam-focusing that allows us to probe the subtle spin-density wave
order in the prototypical high-temperature superconductor La1.88Sr0.12CuO4
under applied uniaxial pressure to demonstrate that it is immediately coupled
with charge-density wave order. Our result shows that suitable models for
high-temperature superconductivity must equally account for charge and spin
degrees of freedom via uniaxial charge-spin stripe fluctuations.

In contrast, we design and develop CalmResponses, a browser-based system which
measures audience eye gaze and nod reactions only with a built-in webcam and
collectively presents them to speakers. The results of our two user studies
indicated that the number of fillers in speaker's speech decreases when

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stac1354",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reverse shock (RS) emission can be used to probe the properties of the
relativistic ejecta, especially the degree of magnetization $\sigma$, in
gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. However, there has been confusion in the
literature regarding the physical condition for the RS formation, and the role
of magnetic fields in the RS dynamics in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime is
not fully understood. Exploiting the shock jump conditions, we characterize the
properties of a magnetized RS. We compare the RS dynamics and forming
conditions from different theories and numerical simulations, and reconcile the
discrepancies among them. The strict RS forming condition is found to be
$\sigma < \sigma_\mathrm{cr}=(8/3)\gamma_4^2(n_1/n_4)$, where $n_4$ and $n_1$
are the rest-frame number densities of the ejecta and the ambient medium,
respectively, $\gamma_4$ is the bulk Lorentz factor, and $\sigma_\mathrm{cr}$
is the critical magnetization. Contrary to previous claims, we prove that this
condition agrees with other theoretical and simulated results, which can be
further applied to the setup and consistency check of future numerical
simulations. Using this condition, we propose a characteristic radius for RS
formation, and categorize the magnetized shell into three regimes: 'thick
shell' (relativistic RS), 'thin shell' (trans-relativistic RS), and 'no RS'
regimes. The critical magnetization $\sigma_\mathrm{cr}$ is generally below
unity for thin shells, but can potentially reaches $\sim 100-1000$ in the
'thick shell' regime. Our results could be applied to the dynamical evolution
of Poynting-flux-dominated ejecta, with potential applications to
self-consistent lightcurve modelling of magnetized relativistic outflows.

companies (TNCs), is realized by real-time optimization algorithms to connect
trips among tens of thousands of drivers and fellow passengers. In a market of
mobility sharing comprised of TNCs, there are two competing principles, the
economies of network scale and the healthy competition between TNCs, which can
lead to ""segmentation"" of market. To understand the substantiality and
relationship of the two competing principles, we need to answer how much
efficiency loss is generated due to the segmentation of market, and which
factors are related to it. Here we show how four critical factors of market
structure and characteristics of mobility sharing services -- density of trips
(thickness), maximum detour allowed for sharing (tightness), market shares
(unevenness), and spatial segregation of the TNCs (dissolvedness) -- are
associated with the efficiency loss, represented as the difference in vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) under different market structures. We found that 1) while
VMT shows a simple power function with thickness, the corresponding exponent
term can be expressed as a non-monotonic function with tightness -- essentially
showing how economies and diseconomies of scale in this market arise, and
appearing a very similar form to the Lennard--Jones model in inter-molecular
potentials; and 2) the efficiency loss is higher when unevenness is closer to
0.5 (50-50 market share) and dissolvedness is larger. Our results give a
comprehensive analysis of how the inefficiency of market segmentation is
generated, and how potentially it may be avoided through market mechanism

in a distributed fashion. Many existing researches have focused on improving
communication efficiency of high-dimensional models and addressing bias caused
by local updates. However, most of FL algorithms are either based on reliable
communications or assume fixed and known unreliability characteristics. In
practice, networks could suffer from dynamic channel conditions and
non-deterministic disruptions, with time-varying and unknown characteristics.
To this end, in this paper we propose a sparsity enabled FL framework with both
communication efficiency and bias reduction, termed as SAFARI. It makes novel
use of a similarity among client models to rectify and compensate for bias that
is resulted from unreliable communications. More precisely, sparse learning is
implemented on local clients to mitigate communication overhead, while to cope
with unreliable communications, a similarity-based compensation method is
proposed to provide surrogates for missing model updates. We analyze SAFARI
under bounded dissimilarity and with respect to sparse models. It is
demonstrated that SAFARI under unreliable communications is guaranteed to
converge at the same rate as the standard FedAvg with perfect communications.
Implementations and evaluations on CIFAR-10 dataset validate the effectiveness

error that is minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we prove
that the breakdown point of the SDR estimator is equal to $1/2$, the highest
possible value of the breakdown point. In addition, the SDR estimator is
equivariant by similarity transforms and has low computational complexity. More
precisely, in the case of $n$ vectors of dimension $p$ -- at most $\varepsilon
n$ out of which are adversarially corrupted -- the SDR estimator has a squared
error of order $\big(\frac{r_\Sigma}{n} +
\varepsilon^2\log(1/\varepsilon)\big){\log p}$ and a running time of order $p^3
+ n p^2$. Here, $r_\Sigma\le p$ is the effective rank of the covariance matrix
of the reference distribution. Another advantage of the SDR estimator is that
it does not require knowledge of the contamination rate and does not involve
sample splitting. We also investigate extensions of the proposed algorithm and
of the obtained results in the case of (partially) unknown covariance matrix.

bulk superconductors are predicted to host Majorana bound states (MBSs) at the
ends of the chain. Here, we investigate the prevalence of trivial zero-energy
bound states in these helical spin chain systems. First, we show that the
Hamiltonian of a helical spin chain on a superconductor can be mapped to an
effective Hamiltonian reminiscent of a semiconductor nanowire with strong
Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In particular, we show that a varying rotation rate
between neighbouring magnetic moments maps to smooth non-uniform potentials in
the effective nanowire Hamiltonian. Previously it has been found that trivial
zero-energy states are abundant in nanowire systems with smooth potentials.
Therefore, we perform an extensive search for zero-energy bound states in
helical spin chain systems with varying rotation rates. Although bound states
with near zero-energy do exist for certain dimensionalities and rotation
profiles, we find that zero-energy bound states are far less prevalent than in
semiconductor nanowire systems with equivalent non-uniformities. In particular,
utilising varying rotation rates, we do not find zero-energy bound states in
the most experimentally relevant setup consisting of a one-dimensional helical
spin chain on the surface of a three-dimensional superconductor, even for
profiles that produce near zero-energy states in equivalent one- and two-
dimensional systems. Although our findings do not rule them out, the much
reduced prevalence of zero-energy bound states in long non-uniform helical spin
chains compared with equivalent semi-conductor nanowires, as well as the
ability to measure states locally via STM, should reduce the experimental
barrier to identifying MBSs in such systems.

algorithm reduces the complexity in comparison to a recent fast Chase decoding
algorithm for Reed--Solomon (RS) codes by the authors (IEEE Trans. IT, 2022),
by requiring only a single Koetter iteration per edge of the decoding tree. In
comparison to the fast Chase algorithms presented by Kamiya (IEEE Trans. IT,
2001) and Wu (IEEE Trans. IT, 2012) for binary BCH codes, the polynomials

  To achieve the complexity reduction, we build on a new isomorphism between
two solution modules in the binary case, and on a degenerate case of the
soft-decision (SD) version of the Wu list decoding algorithm. Roughly speaking,
we prove that when the maximum list size is $1$ in Wu list decoding of binary
BCH codes, assigning a multiplicity of $1$ to a coordinate has the same effect
as flipping this coordinate in a Chase-decoding trial.
  The solution-module isomorphism also provides a systematic way to benefit
from the binary alphabet for reducing the complexity in bounded-distance
hard-decision (HD) decoding. Along the way, we briefly develop the
Groebner-bases formulation of the Wu list decoding algorithm for binary BCH

description of the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems requires
accounting for the dynamic electron correlation, which CASSCF and DMRG largely
miss. In this work a new approach for the correlation energy based on the
adiabatic connection (AC) is proposed. The AC$_{\rm n}$ method accounts for
terms up to the desired order n in the coupling constant, is rigorously
size-consistent, free from instabilities and intruder states. It employs the
particle-hole multireference random phase approximation and the Cholesky
decomposition technique, which leads to a computational cost growing with the
fifth power of the system size. Thanks to AC$_{\rm n}$ depending solely on one-

than existing ab initio dynamic correlation methods for strong correlation.
AC$_{\rm n}$ affords excellent results for singlet-triplet gaps of challenging
organic biradicals. Development presented in this work opens new perspectives
for accurate calculations of systems with dozens of strongly correlated
electrons.

  arXiv:1904.09178",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existence, uniqueness, and $L_p$-approximation results are presented for
scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) by considering the case where,
the drift coefficient has finitely many spatial discontinuities while both
coefficients can grow superlinearly (in the space variable). These
discontinuities are described by a piecewise local Lipschitz continuity and a
piecewise monotone-type condition while the diffusion coefficient is assumed to
be locally Lipschitz continuous and non-degenerate at the discontinuity points
of the drift coefficient. Moreover, the superlinear nature of the coefficients
is dictated by a suitable coercivity condition and a polynomial growth of the
(local) Lipschitz constants of the coefficients. Existence and uniqueness of
strong solutions of such SDEs are obtained. Furthermore, the classical
$L_p$-error rate $1/2$, for a suitable range of values of $p$, is recovered for
a tamed Euler scheme which is used for approximating these solutions. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, these are the first existence, uniqueness and
approximation results for this class of SDEs.

two-point correlations and consider multipoint correlations (Waldenfelds

where the metric aims to quantify the complexity of the nonconvex optimization
landscape of each problem and the success of local search methods in solving
the problem. The existing literature has focused on two complexity bounds. The
RIP constant is commonly used to characterize the complexity of matrix sensing
problems. On the other hand, the incoherence and the sampling rate are used
when analyzing matrix completion problems. The proposed complexity metric has
the potential to generalize these two notions and also applies to a much larger

focus on the rank-$1$ generalized matrix completion problem and illustrate the
usefulness of the new complexity metric on three types of instances, namely,
instances with the RIP condition, instances obeying the Bernoulli sampling
model, and a synthetic example. We show that the complexity metric exhibits a
consistent behavior in the three cases, even when other existing conditions
fail to provide theoretical guarantees. These observations provide a strong
implication that the new complexity metric has the potential to generalize
various conditions of optimization complexity proposed for different
applications. Furthermore, we establish theoretical results to provide
sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of spurious solutions in
terms of the proposed complexity metric. This contrasts with the RIP and
incoherence conditions that fail to provide any necessary condition.

paper, we establish several results on the Boussinesq equation. First, by
solving the direct and inverse problems for an associated third-order spectral
problem, we develop an Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) approach to the
initial value problem. Using this approach, we establish a number of existence,
uniqueness, and blow-up results. For example, the IST approach allows us to
identify physically meaningful global solutions and to construct, for each $T >

expression for the solution of the initial value problem for the Boussinesq

However, naively performing such initialization in RL often works poorly,
especially for value-based methods. In this paper, we present a meta algorithm
that can use offline data, demonstrations, or a pre-existing policy to
initialize an RL policy, and is compatible with any RL approach. In particular,
we propose Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning (JSRL), an algorithm that employs
two policies to solve tasks: a guide-policy, and an exploration-policy. By
using the guide-policy to form a curriculum of starting states for the
exploration-policy, we are able to efficiently improve performance on a set of
simulated robotic tasks. We show via experiments that JSRL is able to
significantly outperform existing imitation and reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly in the small-data regime. In addition, we provide an
upper bound on the sample complexity of JSRL and show that with the help of a
guide-policy, one can improve the sample complexity for non-optimism
exploration methods from exponential in horizon to polynomial.

disciplines of science and engineering like power systems, gene-regulatory
networks, social networks, financial networks, astronomy etc. Furthermore, in
many of these applications the underlying system is dynamical in nature and
because of the complexity of the systems involved, deriving a mathematical
model which can be used for clustering and community detection, is often
impossible. Moreover, while clustering dynamical systems, it is imperative that
the dynamical nature of the underlying system is taken into account. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach for clustering dynamical systems purely from
time-series data which inherently takes into account the dynamical evolution of
the underlying system. In particular, we define a \emph{distance/similarity}
measure between the states of the system which is a function of the influence
that the states have on each other, and use the proposed measure for clustering
of the dynamical system. For data-driven computation we leverage the Koopman
operator framework which takes into account the nonlinearities (if present) of
the underlying system, thus making the proposed framework applicable to a wide
range of application areas. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach
by clustering three different dynamical systems, namely, a linear system, which
acts like a proof of concept, the highly non-linear IEEE 39 bus transmission
network and dynamic variables obtained from atmospheric data over the Amazon
rain forest.

one-dimensional linearized (around $(Q_0,V_0)$ with constants $Q_0>0, V_0>0$)
compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the interval $(0,1)$ when a control
function is acting either on the density or velocity component at one end of
the interval. We first prove that the linearized system, with a Dirichlet
boundary control on the density component and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions on the velocity component, is null-controllable in $H^s_{per}(0,1)
\times L^2(0,1)$ for any $s > 1/2$ provided the time $T > 1$, where
$H^s_{per}(0,1)$ denotes the Sobolev space of periodic functions. The proof is
based on solving a mixed parabolic-hyperbolic moments problem and to do so, we
perform a spectral analysis for the associated adjoint operator which is the
main involved part of this work. As a corollary, we also prove that the system
is approximately controllable in $L^2(0,1) \times L^2(0,1)$ when $T>1$.
  On the other hand, assuming that the density is equal on the two boundary
points w.r.t. time, when a control is applied on the velocity part through a
Dirichlet condition, we can only able to prove that the system is
null-controllable in a strict subspace of finite codimension
$\mathcal{H}\subset H^s_{per}(0,1) \times L^2(0,1)$ for $s>1/2$ when $T>1$.
More precisely, in this case we are able to show that all the eigenfunctions of
the associated adjoint operator are observable for higher frequencies whereas
for the lower frequencies it is hard to conclude anything. A
parabolic-hyperbolic joint Ingham-type inequality which we prove in this
article, leads to an observability inequality in the space $\mathcal{H}^*$ and
the controllability result follows. The significant point is that the moments
method does not yield a better space for the null-controllability when a
control acts on the velocity part.

Julian Oscillation (MJO) by the phase of the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial
Oscillation (QBO) during boreal winter. Composites of the MJO show that upper
tropospheric ice cloud fraction and water vapor anomalies are generally
collocated, and that an eastward tilt with height in cloud fraction exists.
Through radiative transfer calculations, it is shown that ice clouds have a
stronger tropospheric radiative forcing than do water vapor anomalies,
highlighting the importance of incorporating upper tropospheric/lower
stratospheric processes into simple models of the MJO. The coupled
troposphere-stratosphere linear model previously developed by the authors is
extended by including a mean wind in the stratosphere and a prognostic equation
for cirrus clouds, which are forced dynamically and allowed to modulate
tropospheric radiative cooling, similar to the effect of tropospheric water
vapor in previous formulations. Under these modifications, the model still
produces a slow, eastward propagating mode that resembles the MJO. The sign of
zonal mean wind in the stratosphere is shown to control both the upward wave
propagation and tropospheric vertical structure of the mode. Under varying
stratospheric wind and interactive cirrus cloud radiation, the MJO-like mode
has weaker growth rates under stratospheric westerlies than easterlies,
consistent with the observed MJO-QBO relationship. These results are directly
attributable to an enhanced barotropic mode under QBO easterlies. It is also
shown that differential zonal advection of cirrus clouds leads to weaker growth
rates under stratospheric westerlies than easterlies. Implications and
limitations of the linear theory are discussed.

unusually low for spirals though not for Virgo Cluster early-type galaxies. We
carry out radiative transfer modeling of the CO isotopologues with some

means of efficiently moving scattered objects into a target receptacle. Due to
the chaotic nature of aerodynamic forces, a blowing controller must (i)
continually adapt to unexpected changes from its actions, (ii) maintain
fine-grained control, since the slightest misstep can result in large
unintended consequences (e.g., scatter objects already in a pile), and (iii)
infer long-range plans (e.g., move the robot to strategic blowing locations).
We tackle these challenges in the context of deep reinforcement learning,
introducing a multi-frequency version of the spatial action maps framework.
This allows for efficient learning of vision-based policies that effectively
combine high-level planning and low-level closed-loop control for dynamic
mobile manipulation. Experiments show that our system learns efficient
behaviors for the task, demonstrating in particular that blowing achieves
better downstream performance than pushing, and that our policies improve
performance over baselines. Moreover, we show that our system naturally
encourages emergent specialization between the different subpolicies spanning
low-level fine-grained control and high-level planning. On a real mobile robot

non-equivariant methods trained on SO(3)-augmented datasets. More importantly,
local modelling together with SE(3)-equivariance create an ideal setting for
SE(3) scene reconstruction. We show that by training only on single, aligned

with unknown dynamics. While model-based reinforcement learning techniques in
terms of some basis functions are well known in the literature, when it comes
to more complex dynamics, only a local approximation of the model can be
obtained using a limited number of bases. The complexity of the identifier and
the controller can be considerably high if obtaining an approximation over a
larger domain is desired. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general
piecewise nonlinear framework where each piece is responsible for locally
learning and controlling over some region of the domain. We obtain rigorous
uncertainty bounds for the learned piecewise models. The piecewise affine (PWA)
model is then studied as a special case, for which we propose an
optimization-based verification technique for stability analysis of the
closed-loop system. Accordingly, given a time-discretization of the learned
{PWA} system, we iteratively search for a common piecewise Lyapunov function in
a set of positive definite functions, where a non-monotonic convergence is
allowed. This Lyapunov candidate is verified on the uncertain system to either
provide a certificate for stability or find a counter-example when it fails.
This counter-example is added to a set of samples to facilitate the further
learning of a Lyapunov function. We demonstrate the results on two examples and
show that the proposed approach yields a less conservative region of attraction
(ROA) compared with alternative state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we
provide the runtime results to demonstrate potentials of the proposed framework

our fiducial analysis. Including additional photometric redshifts allows us to
calibrate an additional 6 % of the source galaxy sample. Even though further
systematic testing with simulated data is necessary to quantify the impact of
redshift outliers, precision photometric redshifts can be beneficial at high
redshifts and to mitigate selection effects commonly found in spectroscopically
selected calibration samples.

reduced computational costs while enabling a performance comparable to a

supernovae (SN) occurring in star-forming high-density gas and those occurring
in random locations decoupled from star-forming gas to account for SN from
run-away stars or explosions in regions that have been cleared by prior SN,
stellar winds, or radiation. We explore various mixed models by adjusting these
fractions relative to each other. We find that in the simple system of a
periodic stratified gas layer the ISM structure will evolve to one of two
solutions: a ""peak driving"" state where warm gas is volume filling or a
""thermal runaway"" state where hot gas is volume filling. CR pressure and
transport are important factors that strongly influence the solution state the
ISM reaches and have the ability to flip the ISM between solutions. Observable
signatures such as gamma ray emission and HI gas are explored. We find that
gamma ray luminosity from pion decay is largely consistent with observations

Texturify, a GAN-based method that leverages a 3D shape dataset of an object

require any 3D color supervision or correspondence between shape geometry and

surface of the 3D objects by introducing face convolutional operators on a
hierarchical 4-RoSy parametrization to generate plausible object-specific

massive and more diverse spirals with rapidly increasing ""S"". In all cases, the
value of ""S"" seems equally contributed by the baryonic and non-baryonic (dark)

reproduce well most baryon-dominated galaxy parameter distributions, such as
the inner stellar mass profile slope and baryonic scaling relations, but they
struggle to match the full diversity of observed galaxy rotation curves

eventually annihilate in the star core and heat the NS. This effect can be

Prospector. We find that the half-light radius $R_e$, observed at $z_{obs}$,
depends on the formation redshift of the galaxies, $z_{form}$, and that this
relationship depends on stellar mass. At $\log M_*<11$, the relationship is
consistent with $R_e\propto(1+z_{form})^{-1}$, in line with the expectation
that the galaxies' central density depends on the cosmic density at the time of
their formation, i.e. the ""progenitor effect"". At $\log M_*>11$, the
relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ flattens, suggesting that mergers
become increasingly important for the size growth of more massive galaxies
after they quenched. We also find that the relationship between $z_{form}$ and
galaxy compactness similarly depends on stellar mass. While no clear trend is
observed for QGs with $\log M_*>11$, lower-mass QGs that formed earlier, i.e.
with larger $z_{form}$, have larger central stellar mass surface densities,
both within the $R_e$ ($\Sigma_e$) and central 1 kpc ($\Sigma_{1kpc}$), and
also larger $M_{1kpc}/M_*$, the fractional mass within the central 1 kpc. These
trends between $z_{form}$ and compactness, however, essentially disappear, if
the progenitor effect is removed by normalizing the stellar density with the
cosmic density at $z_{form}$. Our findings highlight the importance of
reconstructing the SFH of galaxies before attempting to infer their intrinsic
structural evolution.

as LINERs, is essential (e.g. they are a numerous AGN population in the local
Universe). We obtained VLT/MUSE and GTC/MEGARA optical IFS-data for NGC1052,
the prototypical LINER. The stars are distributed in a dynamically hot disc,
with a centrally peaked velocity dispersion map and large observed velocity
amplitudes. The ionised gas, probed by the primary component is detected up to
$\sim$30arcsec ($\sim$3.3 kpc) mostly in the polar direction with blue and red
velocities ($\mid$V$\mid$$<$250 km/s). The velocity dispersion map shows a
notable enhancement ($\sigma$$>$90 km/s) crossing the galaxy along the major
axis of rotation in the central 10arcsec. The secondary component has a bipolar
morphology, velocity dispersion larger than 150 km/s and velocities up to 660
km/s. A third component is detected but not spatially resolved. The maps of the
NaD absorption indicate optically thick neutral gas with a velocity field
consistent with a slow rotating disc ($\Delta$V = 77$\pm$12 km/s) but the
velocity dispersion map is off-centred without any counterpart in the flux map.
We found evidence of an ionised gas outflow with mass of 1.6$\pm$0.6 $\times$
10$^{5}$ Msun, and mass rate of 0.4$\pm$0.2 Msun/yr. The outflow is propagating
in a cocoon of gas with enhanced turbulence and might be triggering the onset
of kpc-scale buoyant bubbles (polar emission). Taking into account the energy
and kinetic power of the outflow (1.3$\pm$0.9 $\times$ 10$^{53}$ erg and
8.8$\pm$3.5 $\times$ 10$^{40}$ erg/s, respectively) as well as its alignment
with both the jet and the cocoon, and that the gas is collisionally ionised, we
consider that the outflow is jet-powered, although some contribution from the
AGN is possible.

infer the HODs of galaxies at $z<0.5$ in five different stellar mass bins
between $10^{8.5}h^{-2} M_\odot$ and $10^{11.5}h^{-2} M_\odot$ and two colours

recovers the true HODs in the simulated data within the $68\%$ credibility

is also strong evidence ($>3\sigma$) for correlations, increasing with halo
mass, between the numbers of red and blue satellites and galaxies with stellar
masses below $10^{10} \Msun. Possible causes of these correlations are the
selection of similar galaxies in different samples, the survey flux limit, or
physical mechanisms like a fixed ratio between the satellite numbers of
distinct populations. The decorrelation for halos with smaller masses is
probably an effect of shot noise by low-occupancy halos. The inferred HODs can
be used to complement galaxy-galaxy-lensing or galaxy clustering HOD studies or
as input to cosmological analyses and improved mock galaxy catalogues.

Despite the success of Quasi-Linear (QL) theory and Weak Turbulence (WT)
theory, their validities are limited by the requirement of sufficiently dense
mode spectrum and small wave amplitude. In this paper, we extensively studied
the collective processes of a mono-energetic electron beam emitted from a
thermionic cathode propagating through a cold plasma by performing a large
number of high resolution two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations and using analytical theories. We confirm that the initial stage of
two-stream instability is saturated due to well-known wave-trapping mechanism.
Further evolution occurs due to strong wave-wave nonlinear processes. We show
that the beam-plasma interaction can be classified into four different physical
regimes in the parameter space for the plasma and beam parameters. The
differences between the different regimes are analyzed in detail. For the first
time, we identified a new regime in strong Langmuir turbulence featured by what
we call Electron Modulational Instability (EMI) that could create a local
Langmuir wave packet growing faster than the ion plasma frequency. Ions do not
have time to respond to EMI in the initial growing stage. On a longer
timescale, the action of the ponderomotive force produces very strong ion
density perturbations, and eventually the beam-plasma wave interaction stops
being resonant due to strong ion density perturbations. Consequently, in this
EMI regime, electron beam-plasma interaction occurs in a periodic
(intermittent) process. The beams are strongly scattered by waves, and the
Langmuir wave spectrum is significantly broadened, which in turn gives rise to
strong heating of bulk electrons. A resulting kappa distribution and a
wave-energy spectrum, E^2 (k)~k^(-5), are observed in the strong turbulent
regime.

potential of the second field $\chi$. This uplifting ends due to a tachyonic
instability with respect to the field $\chi$, which appears when $\varphi$
becomes smaller than some critical value $\varphi_{c}$. In the large $N$ limit,
these models have the standard universal $\alpha$-attractor predictions. In
particular, $n_{s }= 1- {2 \over N}$ for the exponential attractors. However,
in some special cases the large $N$ limit is reached only beyond the horizon,
for $N \gtrsim 60$. This may change predictions for the cosmological
observations. For any fixed $N$, in the limit of large uplift $V_{\rm up}$, or
in the limit of large $\varphi_{c}$, we find another attractor prediction, $
n_s = 1$. By changing the parameters $V_{\rm up}$ and $\varphi_{c}$ one can
continuously interpolate between the two attractor predictions $n_{s }= 1- {2

very welcome in view of the rapidly growing amount and precision of the
cosmological data. Our main result is not specific to the hybrid inflation
models. Rather, it is generic to any inflationary models where the inflaton
potential, for some reasons, is uplifted, and inflation ends prematurely.

kinetic properties of warm interstellar clouds. Previous studies identified 15
warm partially ionized clouds within about 10~pc of the Sun and measured their
mean thermal and kinematic properties. A new analysis of 100 interstellar
velocity components reveals a wide range of temperatures and turbulent
velocities within the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and other nearby clouds.
These variations appear to be random with Gaussian distributions. We find no
trends of these properties with stellar distance, angle from the Galactic
Center, the main source of EUV radiation (the star $\epsilon$~CMa), the center
of the LIC, or the direction of inflowing interstellar matter into the
heliosphere. The spatial scale for temperature variations in the LIC is likely
smaller than 5,100~au, a distance that the Sun will traverse in 1,000 years.
Essentially all velocity components align with known warm clouds. We find that
within 4~pc of the Sun, space is completely filled with partially ionized
clouds, but at larger distances space is only partially filled with partially
ionized clouds, indicating that fully ionized inter-cloud gas fills the voids.
We find that the neutral hydrogen number density in the LIC and likely other
warm clouds in the CLIC is about 0.10~cm$^{-3}$ rather than the 0.20~cm$^{-3}$
density that may be representative of only the immediate environment of the
LIC. The 3,000--12,000~K temperature range for the gas is consistent with the
predictions of theoretical models of the WNM and WIM, but the high degree of
inhomogeneity within clouds argues against simple theoretical models. Finally,

a double sampling method, in which outcomes are obtained via intensive
follow-up on a subsample of subjects for whom data were initially missing. We
describe assumptions under which the joint distribution of confounders,
treatment, and outcome is identified under this design, and derive efficient
estimators of the average treatment effect under a nonparametric model, as well
as a model assuming outcomes were initially missing at random. We compare these
in simulations to an approach that adaptively selects an estimator based on
evidence of violation of the missing at random assumption. We also show that
the proposed double sampling design can be extended to handle arbitrary
coarsening mechanisms, and derive consistent, asymptotically normal, and
nonparametric efficient estimators of any smooth full data functional of
interest, and prove that these estimators often are multiply robust.

powered cosmic reionization is that it is not possible to directly probe the
ionizing Lyman Continuum (LyC) radiation at that epoch as those photons have
been absorbed by the intervening neutral hydrogen in the IGM on their way to
us. It is therefore imperative to build a model to accurately predict LyC
emission using other properties of galaxies in the reionization era.
  In recent years, studies have shown that the LyC emission from galaxies may
be correlated to their Lya emission. Here, we study this correlation by
analyzing thousands of galaxies at high-z in the SPHINX cosmological
simulation. We post-process these galaxies with the Lya radiative transfer code
RASCAS and analyze the Lya - LyC connection.
  We find that the Lya and LyC luminosities are strongly correlated with each
other, although with dispersion. There is a positive correlation between Lya
and LyC escape fractions in the brightest Lya emitters (>$10^{41}$ erg/s),
similar to the recent observational studies. However, when we also include
fainter Lya emitters (LAEs), the correlation disappears, which suggests that
the observed relationship may be driven by selection effects. We also find that
bright LAEs are dominant contributors to reionization ($> 10^{40}$ erg/s
galaxies contribute $> 90\%$ of LyC emission). Finally, we build predictive
models using multivariate linear regression where we use the physical and the
Lya properties of simulated galaxies to predict their intrinsic and escaping
LyC luminosities with a high degree of accuracy. We find that the most
important galaxy properties to predict the escaping LyC luminosity of a galaxy
are its escaping Lya luminosity, gas mass, gas metallicity, and SFR.
  These models can be very useful to predict LyC emissions from galaxies and
can help us identify the sources of reionization.

Ea, the goal is to determine a function table implementation with a minimized
memory footprint, i.e., number of entries that need to be stored. Rather than
state-of-the-art work performing an even sampling of the given interval by
so-called breakpoints and using linear interpolation between two adjacent
breakpoints to determine f(x) at the maximum error bound, first, we propose
three interval-splitting algorithms to reduce the required memory footprint
drastically based on the observation that in sub-intervals of low gradient, a
coarser sampling grid may be assumed to satisfy the maximum interpolation error
bound. Experiments on elementary mathematical functions show that a large
fraction in memory footprint may be saved. Second, a hardware architecture
implementing the sub-interval selection, breakpoint lookup and interpolation at
a latency of just 9 clock cycles is introduced. Third, within each generated
circuit design, BRAMs are automatically instantiated rather than synthesizing
the reduced footprint function table using LUT primitives providing an
additional degree of resource efficiency.

FL is its performance degradation when dealing with data that are not
independently and identically distributed (non-iid), which is often the case in
medical images. In this paper, we first conduct a theoretical analysis on the
FL algorithm to reveal the problem of model aggregation during training on
non-iid data. With the insights gained through the analysis, we propose a
simple yet effective method, federated cross learning (FedCross), to tackle
this challenging problem. Unlike the conventional FL methods that combine
multiple individually trained local models on a server node, our FedCross
sequentially trains the global model across different clients in a round-robin
manner, and thus the entire training procedure does not involve any model
aggregation steps. To further improve its performance to be comparable with the
centralized learning method, we combine the FedCross with an ensemble learning
mechanism to compose a federated cross ensemble learning (FedCrossEns) method.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using a set of public datasets. The
experimental results show that the proposed FedCross training strategy
outperforms the mainstream FL methods on non-iid data. In addition to improving
the segmentation performance, our FedCrossEns can further provide a
quantitative estimation of the model uncertainty, demonstrating the

composed with an implicit function describing the shape of the tissue, yields
the total deformation gradient field. The deformation gradient is then split
into growth and elastic contributions. The growth tensor captures addition of
mass, i.e. growth, and evolves according to a constitutive equation which is
usually a function of the elastic deformation. Stress is generated in the
material due to the elastic component of the deformation alone. The result of
the registration is obtained by minimizing a total energy functional which
includes: a distance measure reflecting similarity between the shapes, and the
total elastic energy accounting for the growth of the tissue. We apply the
proposed shape registration framework to study zebrafish embryo epiboly process
and tissue expansion during skin reconstruction surgery. We anticipate that our
PDE-constrained shape registration method will improve our understanding of
biological and medical problems in which tissues undergo extreme deformations
over time.

it seems to be the most consistent UV completion of general relativity and the
Standard Model. However, it is hard to verify the existence of this underlying
theory on terrestrial accelerators. One way to probe string theory is to study
its imprints on the low-energy effective inflationary Lagrangian, which are
quantified in terms of high energy correction terms. It is highly likely, thus,
to find higher order curvature terms combined with string moduli, that is
scalar fields, since both these types of interactions and matter fields appear
in string theory. In this work we aim to stress the probability that the
inflationary dynamics are controlled by the synergy of scalar fields and higher
order curvature terms. Specifically, we shall consider a well motivated quantum
corrected canonical scalar field theory, with the quantum corrections being of
the $\mathcal{R}^2$ type. The reason for choosing minimally coupled scalar
theory is basically because if scalar fields are evaluated in their vacuum
configuration, they will either be minimally coupled or conformally coupled.
Here we choose the former case, and the whole study shall be performed in the
string frame (Jordan frame), in contrast to similar studies in the literature
where the Einstein frame two scalar theory is considered. We derive the field
equations of the quantum-corrected theory at leading order and we present the
form the slow-roll indices obtain for the quantum corrected theory. We
exemplify our theoretical framework by using the quadratic inflation model, and
as we show, the $\mathcal{R}^2$ quantum corrected quadratic inflation model
produces a viable inflationary phenomenology, in contrast with the simple
quadratic inflation model.

underrepresented groups, such as accented speakers. In this work, we propose a
novel voice trigger detector that can use a small number of utterances from a
target speaker to improve detection accuracy. Our proposed model employs an
encoder-decoder architecture. While the encoder performs speaker independent
voice trigger detection, similar to the conventional detector, the decoder
predicts a personalized embedding for each utterance. A personalized voice
trigger score is then obtained as a similarity score between the embeddings of
enrollment utterances and a test utterance. The personalized embedding allows
adapting to target speaker's speech when computing the voice trigger score,
hence improving voice trigger detection accuracy. Experimental results show

transport problems. It builds on the data-driven approach underlying the
traditional construction of projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs); is
application-independent; is linearization-free; and therefore is robust for
highly nonlinear problems. Most importantly, this approximation leads to
quadratic PROMs that deliver the same accuracy as their traditional
counterparts using however a much smaller dimension -- typically, $n_2 \sim
\sqrt n_1$, where $n_2$ and $n_1$ denote the dimensions of the quadratic and

structures based on molecular fingerprint representation has been well
established in molecular design. Typically, sequential learning (SL) schemes
such as hidden Markov models (HMM) and, more recently, in the sequential deep
learning context, recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory
(LSTM) were used extensively as generative models to discover unprecedented
molecules. To this end, emission probability between two states of atoms plays
a central role without considering specific chemical or physical properties.
Lack of supervised domain knowledge can mislead the learning procedure to be
relatively biased to the prevalent molecules observed in the training data that
are not necessarily of interest. We alleviated this drawback by augmenting the
training data with domain knowledge, e.g. quantitative estimates of the
drug-likeness score (QEDs). As such, our experiments demonstrated that with
this subtle trick called enriched sequential learning (ESL), specific patterns
of particular interest can be learnt better, which led to generating de novo
molecules with ameliorated QEDs.

Using payment-per-payment and payment-per-loss variables, we construct the

To support the scale of this huge data traffic, more and more base stations and

Nevertheless, practically deploying a large number of base stations having
massive antenna arrays will substantially increase the hardware cost and power
consumption of the network. A promising approach for enhancing the coverage and
rate of wireless communication systems is the large intelligent surface-based
transceiver (LISBT), which uses a spatially continuous surface for signal
transmission and receiving. A typical LIS consists of a planar array having a
large number of reflecting metamaterial elements (e.g., low-cost printed
dipoles), each of which could act as a phase shift. It is also considered to be
a cost effective and energy efficient solution. Accurate channel state
information (CSI) in LISBT-assisted wireless communication systems is critical
for achieving these goals. In this paper, we propose a channel estimation
scheme based on the physical parameters of the system. that requires only five
pilot signals to perfectly estimate the channel parameters assuming there is no
noise at the receiver. In the presence of noise, we propose an iterative
estimation algorithm that decreases the channel estimation error due to noise.
The proposed scheme's training overhead and computational cost do not grow with
the number of antennas, unlike previous work on enormous multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO). The channel estimate scheme based on the physical

PDNPulse, a power delivery network (PDN) based PCB anomaly detection framework

PDNPulse leverages the fact that the PDN's characteristics are inevitably
affected by modifications to the PCB, no matter how minuscule. By detecting
changes to the PDN impedance profile and using the Frechet distance-based
anomaly detection algorithms, PDNPulse can robustly and successfully discern
malicious modifications across the system. Using PDNPulse, we conduct extensive

  Keystroke Inference Attacks Under Low Data",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Keystroke inference attacks are a form of side-channel attacks in which an
attacker leverages various techniques to recover a user's keystrokes as she
inputs information into some display (e.g., while sending a text message or
entering her pin). Typically, these attacks leverage machine learning
approaches, but assessing the realism of the threat space has lagged behind the
pace of machine learning advancements, due in-part, to the challenges in
curating large real-life datasets. We aim to overcome the challenge of having
limited number of real data by introducing a video domain adaptation technique
that is able to leverage synthetic data through supervised disentangled
learning. Specifically, for a given domain, we decompose the observed data into
two factors of variation: Style and Content. Doing so provides four learned
representations: real-life style, synthetic style, real-life content and
synthetic content. Then, we combine them into feature representations from all
combinations of style-content pairings across domains, and train a model on
these combined representations to classify the content (i.e., labels) of a
given datapoint in the style of another domain. We evaluate our method on
real-life data using a variety of metrics to quantify the amount of information
an attacker is able to recover. We show that our method prevents our model from
overfitting to a small real-life training set, indicating that our method is an
effective form of data augmentation, thereby making keystroke inference attacks
more practical.

of the entire program space. In this paper, we show that it is possible to
build a program synthesizer that is both pragmatic and efficient by
approximating the joint distribution of programs with a product of independent

factored distribution approximates the exact joint distribution well when the
examples are given pragmatically, and is compatible with a basic neuro-symbolic

assuming a factored approximation performs better than a synthesizer assuming
an exact joint distribution when evaluated on natural human inputs. This
suggests that humans may be assuming a factored distribution while

distributed learning where clients train AI models directly on their devices
instead of sharing their data with a centralized (potentially adversarial)
server. Although FL preserves local data privacy to some extent, it has been
shown that information about clients' data can still be inferred from model
updates. In recent years, various privacy-preserving schemes have been
developed to address this privacy leakage. However, they often provide privacy
at the expense of model performance or system efficiency, and balancing these
tradeoffs is a crucial challenge when implementing FL schemes. In this
manuscript, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) framework
built on the synergy of matrix encryption and system immersion tools from
control theory. The idea is to immerse the learning algorithm, a Stochastic
Gradient Decent (SGD), into a higher-dimensional system (the so-called target
system) and design the dynamics of the target system so that: the trajectories
of the original SGD are immersed/embedded in its trajectories, and it learns on
encrypted data (here we use random matrix encryption). Matrix encryption is
reformulated at the server as a random change of coordinates that maps original
parameters to a higher-dimensional parameter space and enforces that the target
SGD converges to an encrypted version of the original SGD optimal solution. The
server decrypts the aggregated model using the left inverse of the immersion
map. We show that our algorithm provides the same level of accuracy and
convergence rate as the standard FL with a negligible computation cost while
revealing no information about the clients' data.

slight overlithiated layer at the interface prior to cycling; a result that is
consistent with the excess charge capacity measured during the first cycle.
Cryogenic electron microscopy further reveals intimate contact between LNMO and

we identify hierarchical 3D sub-structures inside the clouds with the aim to
understand their dynamics and distinguish between the theories of
gravo-turbulent fragmentation and global hierarchical collapse. The virial
analysis shows that the dense gas is indeed dominated by the interplay of
gravity and turbulence, while magnetic fields and thermal pressure are only
important for fluffy, atomic structures. Over time, gravitationally bound
sub-structures emerge from a marginally bound medium (viral ratio $1 \leq

tidal tensor is highly anisotropic. Yet the tidal forces are generally not

applications in quantum bio-sensing such as nanoscale magnetometry,
thermometry, and electrometry. A key challenge in the development of such
applications is a large variation in fluorescence properties observed between
particles, even when obtained from the same batch or nominally identical
fabrication processes. By theoretically modelling the emission of
nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in spherical nanoparticles, we are able to show
that the fluorescence spectrum varies with the exact position of the emitter
within the nanoparticle, with noticeable effects seen when the diamond radius,
$a$, is larger than around 100 nm, and significantly modified fluorescence
profiles found for larger particles when $a=200$ nm and $a=300$ nm, while
negligible effects below $a=100$ nm. These results show that the reproducible
geometry of point defect position within narrowly sized batch of diamond
crystals is necessary for controlling the emission properties. Our results are
useful for understanding the extent to which nanodiamonds can be optimised for
bio-sensing applications.

pocket of the dopamine D2 receptor than those produced by a comparable
ligand-based 2D generative method, as measured by docking scores, expected
stereochemistry, and recoverability in commercial chemical databases. Predicted
protein-ligand contacts were found among highest-ranked docking poses with a

include separability/entanglement, Schmidt numbers of bi-partite states and
block-positivity, together with various kinds of positive maps between matrix
algebras like entanglement breaking maps, $k$-superpositive maps, completely
positive maps, $k$-positive maps. We will begin with concrete examples of
elementary positive maps given by $x\mapsto s^*xs$, and use Choi matrices and
duality to explain all the notions mentioned above. We also show that the Choi
matrix can be defined free from coordinates. The above notions of positive maps
give rise to mapping cones, whose dual cones are characterized in terms of
compositions or tensor products of linear maps. Through the discussion, we
exhibit an identity which connects tensor products and compositions of linear
maps between matrix algebras through the Choi matrices. Using this identity, we
show that the description of the dual cone with tensor products is possible
only when the involving cones are mapping cones, and recover various known
criteria with ampliation for the notions mentioned above. As another
applications of the identity, we construct various mapping cones arising from
ampliation and factorization, and provide several equivalent statements to PPT

spin-based topological phenomena in real and momentum spaces. Of particular
interest is the emergence of Berry curvature, whose geometric origin,
accessibility from Hall transport experiments, and material tunability, bodes
well for new physics and practical devices. Cr1+dTe2, a self-intercalated
magnetic transition metal dichalcogenide, TMD, exhibits attractive natural
attributes relevant to such applications, including topological magnetism,
tunable electron filling, magnetic frustration etc. While recent studies have
explored real-space Berry curvature effects in this material, similar
considerations of momentum-space Berry curvature are lacking. Here, we
systematically investigate the electronic structure and transport properties of
epitaxial Cr1+dTe2 thin films over a wide range of doping, d between 0.33 and
0.71. Spectroscopic experiments reveal the presence of a characteristic
semi-metallic band region near the Brillouin Zone edge, which shows a rigid
band like energy shift as a function of d. Transport experiments show that the
intrinsic component of the anomalous Hall effect, AHE, is sizable, and
undergoes a sign flip across d. Finally, density functional theory calculations
establish a causal link between the observed doping evolution of the band
structure and AHE: the AHE sign flip is shown to emerge from the sign change of
the Berry curvature, as the semi-metallic band region crosses the Fermi energy.
Our findings underscore the increasing relevance of momentum-space Berry
curvature in magnetic TMDs and provide a unique platform for intertwining
topological physics in real and momentum spaces.

decompositions in graphs undergoing edge deletions directly by removing sparse
cuts repeatedly can be made efficient. Formally, for an $m$-edge undirected
graph $G$, we say a cut $(S, \overline{S})$ is $\phi$-sparse if $|E_G(S,
\overline{S})| < \phi \cdot \min\{vol_G(S), vol_G(\overline{S})\}$. A
$\phi$-expander decomposition of $G$ is a partition of $V$ into sets $X_1, X_2,
\ldots, X_k$ such that each cluster $G[X_i]$ contains no $\phi$-sparse cut
(meaning it is a $\phi$-expander) with $\tilde{O}(\phi m)$ edges crossing
between clusters. A natural way to compute a $\phi$-expander decomposition is
to decompose clusters by $\phi$-sparse cuts until no such cut is contained in
any cluster. We show that even in graphs undergoing edge deletions, a slight
relaxation of this meta-algorithm can be implemented efficiently with amortized
update time $m^{o(1)}/\phi^2$. Our approach naturally extends to maintaining
directed $\phi$-expander decompositions and $\phi$-expander hierarchies and
thus gives a unifying framework while having simpler proofs than previous
state-of-the-art work. In all settings, our algorithm matches the run-times of
previous algorithms up to subpolynomial factors. Moreover, our algorithm
provides stronger guarantees for $\phi$-expander decompositions. For example,
for graphs undergoing edge deletions, our approach is the first to maintain a
dynamic expander decomposition where each updated decomposition is a refinement
of the previous decomposition, and our approach is the first to guarantee a
sublinear $\phi m^{1+o(1)}$ bound on the total number of edges that cross
between clusters across the entire sequence of dynamic updates.

in infrared-luminous galaxies, with a prevalence that increases with IR
luminosity, suggesting that they trace gas-rich galaxy mergers. Given the
proximity of the rest frequencies of OH and the hyperfine transition of neutral
atomic hydrogen (HI), radio surveys to probe the cosmic evolution of HI in
galaxies also offer exciting prospects for exploiting OHMs to probe the cosmic
history of gas-rich mergers. Using observations for the Looking At the Distant
Universe with the MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) deep HI survey, we report the first
untargeted detection of an OHM at $z > 0.5$, LADUMA J033046.20$-$275518.1
(nicknamed ""Nkalakatha""). The host system, WISEA J033046.26$-$275518.3, is an
infrared-luminous radio galaxy whose optical redshift $z \approx 0.52$ confirms
the MeerKAT emission line detection as OH at a redshift $z_{\rm OH} = 0.5225
\pm 0.0001$ rather than HI at lower redshift. The detected spectral line has
18.4$\sigma$ peak significance, a width of $459 \pm 59\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, and
an integrated luminosity of $(6.31 \pm 0.18\,{\rm [statistical]}\,\pm
0.31\,{\rm [systematic]}) \times 10^3\,L_\odot$, placing it among the most
luminous OHMs known. The galaxy's far-infrared luminosity $L_{\rm FIR} = (1.576
\pm 0.013) \times 10^{12}\,L_\odot$ marks it as an ultra-luminous infrared
galaxy; its ratio of OH and infrared luminosities is similar to those for
lower-redshift OHMs. A comparison between optical and OH redshifts offers a
slight indication of an OH outflow. This detection represents the first step
towards a systematic exploitation of OHMs as a tracer of galaxy growth at high
redshifts.

Specifically, \emph{periodic} reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs) such
as RotorNet (SIGCOMM 2017), Opera (NSDI 2020) and Sirius (SIGCOMM 2020) have
been shown to provide high throughput, by emulating a \emph{complete graph}
through fast periodic circuit switch scheduling.
  However, to achieve such a high throughput, existing reconfigurable network
designs pay a high price: in terms of potentially high delays, but also, as we
show as a first contribution in this paper, in terms of the high buffer
requirements. In particular, we show that under buffer constraints, emulating
the high-throughput complete graph is infeasible at scale, and we uncover a
spectrum of unvisited and attractive alternative RDCNs, which emulate regular
graphs, but with lower node degree than the complete graph.
  We present Mars, a periodic reconfigurable topology which emulates a
$d$-regular graph with near-optimal throughput. In particular, we
systematically analyze how the degree~$d$ can be optimized for throughput given
the available buffer and delay tolerance of the datacenter. We further show
empirically that Mars achieves higher throughput compared to existing systems
when buffer sizes are bounded.

to families of minimal rational curves on uniruled projective manifolds.
  We prove that such a structure is locally symmetric when the dimension of the
uniruled projective manifold is at least 5. By the classification result of
Merkulov and Schwachh\""ofer on irreducible affine holonomy, the problem is
reduced to the case when the VMRT at a general point of the uniruled projective
manifold is isomorphic to a subadjoint variety. In the latter situation, we
prove a stronger result that, without the assumption of 1-flatness, the
structure arising from VMRT is always locally flat. The proof employs the
method of Cartan connections. An interesting feature is that Cartan connections
are considered not for the G-structures themselves, but for certain geometric
structures on the spaces of minimal rational curves.

the massive utility of extracting events in structured formats from large

extraction is framed as an extractive question-answering task. One of the key
advantages of the MRC-based approach is its ability to perform zero-shot

lexical distance between trigger and argument words and the difficulty of
processing syntactically complex sentences plague MRC-based approaches. In this

event extraction by performing unsupervised sentence simplification guided by
the MRC model itself. We evaluate our approach on the ICEWS geopolitical event

MRC-based event extraction by more than 5% for actor extraction and more than
10% for target extraction.

perturbation. As a result, the Republic of Korea is planning a rendezvous
mission to Apophis. Aims. Our aim was to use photometric data from the
apparitions in 2020-2021 to refine the shape model and spin state of Apophis.
Methods. Using thirty-six 1 to 2-m class ground-based telescopes and the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we performed a photometric observation
campaign throughout the 2020-2021 apparition. The convex shape model and spin
state were refined using the light-curve inversion method. Results. According
to our best-fit model, Apophis is rotating in a short axis mode with rotation
and precession periods of 264.178 hours and 27.38547 hours, respectively. The
angular momentum vector orientation of Apophis was found as (275$^\circ$,
-85$^\circ$) in the ecliptic coordinate system. The ratio of the dynamic
moments of inertia of this asteroid was fitted to $I_a:I_b:I_c=0.64:0.97:1$,
which corresponds to an elongated prolate ellipsoid. These findings regarding
the spin state and shape model could be used to not only design the space

Typically, it is intractable to test an autonomous system for every scenario in
its operating environment. The question of whether it is possible to design a
single test for multiple requirements of the system motivates this work. First,
we formally define three attributes of a test: a test specification that
characterizes behaviors observed in a test execution, a test environment, and a
test policy. Using the merge operator from contract-based design theory, we
provide a formalism to construct a merged test specification from two unit test
specifications. Temporal constraints on the merged test specification guarantee
that non-trivial satisfaction of both unit test specifications is necessary for
a successful merged test execution. We assume that the test environment remains
the same across the unit tests and the merged test. Given a test specification
and a test environment, we synthesize a test policy filter using a receding
horizon approach, and use the test policy filter to guide a search procedure
(e.g. Monte-Carlo Tree Search) to find a test policy that is guaranteed to
satisfy the test specification. This search procedure finds a test policy that
maximizes a pre-defined robustness metric for the test while the filter
guarantees a test policy for satisfying the test specification. We prove that
our algorithm is sound. Furthermore, the receding horizon approach to
synthesizing the filter ensures that our algorithm is scalable. Finally, we
show that merging unit tests is impactful for designing efficient test
campaigns to achieve similar levels of coverage in fewer test executions. We
illustrate our framework on two self-driving examples in a discrete-state
setting.

in nature: A species may go extinct in an ecosystem or a protein may attach to
a target site on a DNA strand. Because these systems are inherently
out-of-equilibrium, they pose a range of mathematical challenges. In this
article, we investigate how they respond to external perturbations and develop
a new theory that extends the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem,
a powerful tool from statistical mechanics which connects the response of a
system to thermodynamic fluctuations. We apply our theory to two paradigmatic
examples that span vastly different fields - a birth-death process in forest
ecosystems and a targeted search on DNA by proteins. These systems can be
affected by perturbations which increase their rate of extinction/absorption,
even though the average or the variance of population sizes are left
unmodified. The increase in extinction probability persists beyond the duration
of the perturbation, never recovering to values from the unperturbed regime.
These effects are not captured by the standard response theory; instead, our
framework exactly predicts the evolution of the observed probability of
extinction. Our theoretical approach is general and applicable to any system

Dawn will reveal insights into the properties of the first galaxies and advance
cosmological parameter estimation. Until recently, the primary focus for
astrophysical parameter inference from the 21-cm signal centred on the power
spectrum (PS). However, the cosmic 21-cm signal is highly non-Gaussian
rendering the PS sub-optimal for characterising the cosmic signal. In this
work, we introduce a new technique to analyse the non-Gaussian information in
images of the 21-cm signal called the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST). This
approach closely mirrors that of convolutional neural networks with the added
advantage of not requiring tuning or training of a neural network. Instead, it
compresses the 2D spatial information into a set of coefficients making it
easier to interpret while also providing a robust statistical description of
the non-Gaussian information contained in the cosmic 21-cm signal. First, we
explore the application of the WST to mock 21-cm images to gain valuable
physical insights by comparing to the known behaviour from the 21-cm PS. Then
we quantitatively explore the WST applied to the 21-cm signal by extracting
astrophysical parameter constraints using Fisher Matrices from a realistic 1000
hr mock observation with the Square Kilometre Array. We find that: (i) the WST
applied only to 2D images can outperform the 3D spherically averaged 21-cm PS,
(ii) the excision of foreground contaminated modes can degrade the constraining
power by a factor of ~1.5-2 with the WST and (iii) higher cadences between the
21-cm images can further improve the constraining power.

process is in continuous interaction with other processes and the environment.
If a bug can be exposed only in a certain state, a fuzzer needs to provide a
specific sequence of events as inputs that would take protocol into this state
before the bug is manifested. We call these bugs as ""stateful"" bugs. Usually,
when we are testing a protocol implementation, we do not have a detailed formal
specification of the protocol to rely upon. Without knowledge of the protocol,
it is inherently difficult for a fuzzer to discover such stateful bugs. A key
challenge then is to cover the state space without an explicit specification of
the protocol.
  In this work, we posit that manual annotations for state identification can
be avoided for stateful protocol fuzzing. Specifically, we rely on a
programmatic intuition that the state variables used in protocol
implementations often appear in enum type variables whose values (the state
names) come from named constants. In our analysis of the Top-50 most widely
used open-source protocol implementations, we found that every implementation
uses state variables that are assigned named constants (with easy to comprehend
names such as INIT, READY) to represent the current state. In this work, we
propose to automatically identify such state variables and track the sequence
of values assigned to them during fuzzing to produce a ""map"" of the explored
state space.
  Our experiments confirm that our stateful fuzzer discovers stateful bugs
twice as fast as the baseline greybox fuzzer that we extended. Starting from
the initial state, our fuzzer exercises one order of magnitude more
state/transition sequences and covers code two times faster than the baseline
fuzzer. Several zero-day bugs in prominent protocol implementations were found
by our fuzzer, and 8 CVEs have been assigned.

synthetic and real-world data, including the limited source environmental
variations and the large distribution gap between synthetic and real-world
data, significantly hinders the model performance on unseen real-world scenes.
In this work, we propose the Style-HAllucinated Dual consistEncy learning
(SHADE) framework to handle such domain shift. Specifically, SHADE is
constructed based on two consistency constraints, Style Consistency (SC) and
Retrospection Consistency (RC). SC enriches the source situations and
encourages the model to learn consistent representation across
style-diversified samples. RC leverages real-world knowledge to prevent the
model from overfitting to synthetic data and thus largely keeps the
representation consistent between the synthetic and real-world models.
Furthermore, we present a novel style hallucination module (SHM) to generate
style-diversified samples that are essential to consistency learning. SHM
selects basis styles from the source distribution, enabling the model to
dynamically generate diverse and realistic samples during training. Experiments
show that our SHADE yields significant improvement and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by 5.05% and 8.35% on the average mIoU of three
real-world datasets on single- and multi-source settings, respectively.

learning with errors (LWE) problem and its continuous analog, CLWE (Bruna,
Regev, Song and Tang, STOC 2021). This allows us to bring to bear the powerful
machinery of LWE-based cryptography to the applications of CLWE. For example,
we obtain the hardness of CLWE under the classical worst-case hardness of the
gap shortest vector problem. Previously, this was known only under quantum
worst-case hardness of lattice problems. More broadly, with our reductions
between the two problems, any future developments to LWE will also apply to
CLWE and its downstream applications.
  As a concrete application, we show an improved hardness result for density
estimation for mixtures of Gaussians. In this computational problem, given
sample access to a mixture of Gaussians, the goal is to output a function that
estimates the density function of the mixture. Under the (plausible and widely
believed) exponential hardness of the classical LWE problem, we show that
Gaussian mixture density estimation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with roughly $\log n$
Gaussian components given $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ samples requires time
quasi-polynomial in $n$. Under the (conservative) polynomial hardness of LWE,
we show hardness of density estimation for $n^{\epsilon}$ Gaussians for any
constant $\epsilon > 0$, which improves on Bruna, Regev, Song and Tang (STOC
2021), who show hardness for at least $\sqrt{n}$ Gaussians under polynomial
(quantum) hardness assumptions.
  Our key technical tool is a reduction from classical LWE to LWE with
$k$-sparse secrets where the multiplicative increase in the noise is only
$O(\sqrt{k})$, independent of the ambient dimension $n$.

out-of-distribution (OOD) samples as a major challenge in the safe deployment
of deep learning (DL) models. It is desired that the DL model should only be
confident about the in-distribution (ID) data which reinforces the driving

Motivated by the recent studies that show self-supervised adversarial
contrastive learning helps robustify the model, we empirically show that a
pre-trained model with self-supervised contrastive learning yields a better
model for uni-dimensional feature learning in the latent space. The method
proposed in this work referred to as RODD outperforms SOTA detection
performance on an extensive suite of benchmark datasets on OOD detection tasks.
On the CIFAR-100 benchmarks, RODD achieves a 26.97 $\%$ lower false-positive

destructed after reaching a maximum at a moderate interaction strength. In
contrast, the $xy$-plane ferromagnetism develops only above a critical

proposed VLC GBSM can capture unique indoor VLC channel characteristics such as
the space-time-frequency non-stationarity caused by large light-emitting diode

of visible light waves, respectively. In addition, the proposed model can
support special radiation patterns of LEDs, 3D translational and rotational
motions of the optical receiver (Rx), and can be applied to angle diversity
receivers (ADRs). Key channel properties are simulated and analyzed, including
the space-time-frequency correlation function (STFCF), received power, root
mean square (RMS) delay spread, and path loss (PL). Simulation results verify
the space-time-frequency non-stationarity in indoor VLC channels. Finally, the
accuracy and practicality of the proposed model are validated by comparing the
simulation result of channel 3dB bandwidth with the existing measurement data.
The proposed channel model will play a supporting role in the design of future

precipitated from meltwater. Moreover, stratigraphically higher samples

solve this issue, there has been a number of work trying to improve model

an adversary that evaluates the fairness of a model besides its prediction
accuracy on the main task, and performs joint-optimization to achieve a

individual neuron level. Based on this observation, we propose FairNeuron, a

  https://gait3d.github.io/",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Existing studies for gait recognition are dominated by 2D representations
like the silhouette or skeleton of the human body in constrained scenes.
However, humans live and walk in the unconstrained 3D space, so projecting the
3D human body onto the 2D plane will discard a lot of crucial information like
the viewpoint, shape, and dynamics for gait recognition. Therefore, this paper
aims to explore dense 3D representations for gait recognition in the wild,
which is a practical yet neglected problem. In particular, we propose a novel
framework to explore the 3D Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model of the
human body for gait recognition, named SMPLGait. Our framework has two
elaborately-designed branches of which one extracts appearance features from
silhouettes, the other learns knowledge of 3D viewpoints and shapes from the 3D
SMPL model. In addition, due to the lack of suitable datasets, we build the
first large-scale 3D representation-based gait recognition dataset, named
Gait3D. It contains 4,000 subjects and over 25,000 sequences extracted from 39
cameras in an unconstrained indoor scene. More importantly, it provides 3D SMPL
models recovered from video frames which can provide dense 3D information of
body shape, viewpoint, and dynamics. Based on Gait3D, we comprehensively
compare our method with existing gait recognition approaches, which reflects
the superior performance of our framework and the potential of 3D
representations for gait recognition in the wild. The code and dataset are

$\widetilde{O}(nk^{\omega-1})$.
  In our main technical result, we achieve the optimal limit on domain
sparsification for strongly Rayleigh distributions. In domain sparsification,
sampling from a distribution $\mu$ on $\binom{[n]}{k}$ is reduced to sampling
from related distributions on $\binom{[t]}{k}$ for $t\ll n$. We show that for
strongly Rayleigh distributions, we can can achieve the optimal
$t=\widetilde{O}(k)$. Our reduction involves sampling from $\widetilde{O}(1)$
domain-sparsified distributions, all of which can be produced efficiently
assuming convenient access to approximate overestimates for marginals of $\mu$.
Having access to marginals is analogous to having access to the mean and
covariance of a continuous distribution, or knowing ""isotropy"" for the
distribution, the key assumption behind the Kannan-Lov\'asz-Simonovits (KLS)
conjecture and optimal samplers based on it. We view our result as a moral
analog of the KLS conjecture and its consequences for sampling, for discrete
strongly Rayleigh measures.

as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), has been known as a popular
computationally-efficient alternative to the popular L1-minimization based
methods. This paper proposes a new SSC scheme using generalized OMP (GOMP), a
soup-up of OMP whereby multiple neighbors are identified per iteration, along
with a new stopping rule requiring nothing more than a knowledge of the ambient
signal dimension. Compared to conventional OMP, which identifies one neighbor
per iteration, the proposed GOMP method involves fewer iterations, thereby
enjoying lower algorithmic complexity; advantageously, the proposed stopping
rule is free from off-line estimation of subspace dimension and noise power.
Under the semi-random model, analytic performance guarantees, in terms of
neighbor recovery rates, are established to justify the advantage of the
proposed GOMP. The results show that, with a high probability, GOMP (i) is
halted by the proposed stopping rule, and (ii) can retrieve more true neighbors
than OMP, consequently yielding higher final data clustering accuracy. Computer
simulations using both synthetic data and real human face data are provided to
validate our analytic study and evidence the effectiveness of the proposed

predicting and updating the mask in localized areas. For higher efficiency, we
decompose the slow prediction on the entire image into two fast inferences on
small crops: a coarse segmentation on the Target Crop, and a local refinement
on the Focus Crop. To make the model work with preexisting masks, we formulate
a sub-task termed Interactive Mask Correction, and propose Progressive Merge as
the solution. Progressive Merge exploits morphological information to decide
where to preserve and where to update, enabling users to refine any preexisting

by the periodic hexagonal rings, including graphene and carbon nanotube, has
opened up a new avenue to realize dynamic covalent materials. However, for the
carbon materials with hybrid carbon rings, such as biphenylene, whether the
dynamic oxygen migration at its interface can still be found remains unknown.
Using both density functional theory calculations and machine-learning-based
molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations, we found that the oxygen migration
departing away from the four-membered carbon (C4) ring is hindered, and the
oxygen atom prefers to spontaneously migrate toward/around the C4 ring. This
locally spontaneous dynamic oxygen migration on the biphenylene is attributed
to the high barrier of about 1.5 eV for the former process and relatively low
barrier of about 0.3 eV for the latter one, originating from the enhanced
activity of C-O bond near/around the C4 ring due to the hybrid carbon rings
structure. Moreover, the locally spontaneous dynamic oxygen migration is
further confirmed by MLMD simulations. This work sheds light on the potential
of biphenylene as a catalyst for spatial-controlled energy conversion and
provides the guidance for realizing the dynamic covalent interface at other
carbon-based or two-dimensional materials.

introduce three different models: continuous time, discrete time and hybrid
models. The given physical information is integrated into Gaussian process
model through our designed GP loss functions. Three types of loss function are
provided in this paper based on two different approaches to train the standard
GP model. The first part of the paper introduces the continuous time model
which treats temporal domain the same as spatial domain. The unknown
coefficients in given PDEs can be jointly learned with GP hyper-parameters by
minimizing the designed loss function. In the discrete time models, we first
choose a time discretization scheme to discretize the temporal domain. Then the
PAGP model is applied at each time step together with the scheme to approximate
PDE solutions at given test points of final time. To discover unknown
coefficients in this setting, observations at two specific time are needed and
a mixed mean square error function is constructed to obtain the optimal
coefficients. In the last part, a novel hybrid model combining the continuous
and discrete time models is presented. It merges the flexibility of continuous
time model and the accuracy of the discrete time model. The performance of
choosing different models with different GP loss functions is also discussed.
The effectiveness of the proposed PAGP methods is illustrated in our numerical

applications. The maximal distortion treats imprecise reconstruction of a
function value as good as perfect computation if it deviates less than a
tolerance level, while treating reconstruction that differs by more than that
level as a failure. Using a geometric understanding of the maximal distortion,
we propose a hypergraph-based source coding scheme for function computation
that is constructive in the sense that it gives an explicit procedure for
finding optimal or good auxiliary random variables. Moreover, we find that the
hypergraph-based coding scheme achieves the optimal rate-distortion function in
the setting of coding for computing with side information and achieves the
Berger-Tung sum-rate inner bound in the setting of distributed source coding
for computing. It also achieves the El Gamal-Cover inner bound for multiple
description coding for computing and is optimal for successive refinement and
cascade multiple description problems for computing. Lastly, the benefit of
complexity reduction of finding a forward test channel is shown for a class of
Markov sources.

uncertainty of future and reasoning ability requirement make the anticipation
task very challenging and far beyond solved. In this filed, previous methods
usually care more about the model architecture design or but few attention has
been put on how to train an anticipation model with a proper learning policy.
To this end, in this work, we propose a novel training scheme called Dynamic
Context Removal (DCR), which dynamically schedules the visibility of observed
future in the learning procedure. It follows the human-like curriculum learning
process, i.e., gradually removing the event context to increase the
anticipation difficulty till satisfying the final anticipation target. Our
learning scheme is plug-and-play and easy to integrate any reasoning model
including transformer and LSTM, with advantages in both effectiveness and
efficiency. In extensive experiments, the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art on four widely-used benchmarks. Our code and models are

image classification and computer vision techniques. In general, image
inpainting is a task of recreating or reconstructing any broken image which
could be a photograph or oil/acrylic painting. With the advancement in the
field of Artificial Intelligence, this topic has become popular among AI
enthusiasts. With our approach, we propose an initial end-to-end pipeline for
inpainting images using a complete Machine Learning approach instead of a
conventional application-based approach. We first use the YOLO model to
automatically identify and localize the object we wish to remove from the
image. Using the result obtained from the model we can generate a mask for the
same. After this, we provide the masked image and original image to the GAN
model which uses the Contextual Attention method to fill in the region. It
consists of two generator networks and two discriminator networks and is also
called a coarse-to-fine network structure. The two generators use fully
convolutional networks while the global discriminator gets hold of the entire
image as input while the local discriminator gets the grip of the filled region
as input. The contextual Attention mechanism is proposed to effectively borrow
the neighbor information from distant spatial locations for reconstructing the
missing pixels. The third part of our implementation uses SRGAN to resolve the
inpainted image back to its original size. Our work is inspired by the paper

recommendation is the task of suggesting items that can satisfy a group of
users. In group recommendation, the core is to design preference aggregation
functions to obtain a quality summary of all group members' preferences. Such
user and group preferences are commonly represented as points in the vector
space (i.e., embeddings), where multiple user embeddings are compressed into
one to facilitate ranking for group-item pairs. However, the resulted group
representations, as points, lack adequate flexibility and capacity to account
for the multi-faceted user preferences. Also, the point embedding-based
preference aggregation is a less faithful reflection of a group's
decision-making process, where all users have to agree on a certain value in
each embedding dimension instead of a negotiable interval. In this paper, we
propose a novel representation of groups via the notion of hypercubes, which
are subspaces containing innumerable points in the vector space. Specifically,
we design the hypercube recommender (CubeRec) to adaptively learn group
hypercubes from user embeddings with minimal information loss during preference
aggregation, and to leverage a revamped distance metric to measure the affinity
between group hypercubes and item points. Moreover, to counteract the
long-standing issue of data sparsity in group recommendation, we make full use
of the geometric expressiveness of hypercubes and innovatively incorporate
self-supervision by intersecting two groups. Experiments on four real-world
datasets have validated the superiority of CubeRec over state-of-the-art
baselines.

(SGD) for the scenarios when gradient noise exhibits heavy tails. The proposed

normalized, signed or quantized gradient, but we also consider novel
nonlinearity choices. We establish for the considered class of methods strong
convergence guarantees assuming a strongly convex cost function with Lipschitz
continuous gradients under very general assumptions on the gradient noise. Most
notably, we show that, for a nonlinearity with bounded outputs and for the
gradient noise that may not have finite moments of order greater than one, the
nonlinear SGD's mean squared error (MSE), or equivalently, the expected cost
function's optimality gap, converges to zero at rate~$O(1/t^\zeta)$, $\zeta \in
(0,1)$. In contrast, for the same noise setting, the linear SGD generates a
sequence with unbounded variances. Furthermore, for the nonlinearities that can
be decoupled component wise, like, e.g., sign gradient or component-wise
clipping, we show that the nonlinear SGD asymptotically (locally) achieves a
$O(1/t)$ rate in the weak convergence sense and explicitly quantify the
corresponding asymptotic variance. Experiments show that, while our framework
is more general than existing studies of SGD under heavy-tail noise, several
easy-to-implement nonlinearities from our framework are competitive with state
of the art alternatives on real data sets with heavy tail noises.

very useful in assessing the trees health. In high moisture tropical areas such

The tropical complex soil characteristics due to the high moisture content
tends to affect penetration depth of the signal. This limits the depth range of
the GPR. Typically, a wide band signal is used to increase the penetration
depth and to improve the resolution of the GPR. However, this broad band
frequency tends to be noisy and selective frequency filtering is required for
noise reduction. Therefore, in this paper, we adapt the stepped frequency
continuous wave (SFCW) GPR and propose the use of a Joint time frequency
analysis (JTFA) method called short time Fourier transform (STFT), to reduce
noise and enhance tree root detection. The proposed methodology is illustrated
and tested with controlled experiments and real tree roots testing. The results
show promising prospects of the method for tree roots detection in tropical

Labeled Tagged Transition System), the framework borrows ideas from several
domains: Probabilistic Automata of Segala, Probabilistic Concurrent Systems,
and Probabilistic labelled transition systems. To every node on a DLTTS is
attached a tag that represents the 'current' knowledge of the adversary,
acquired from the responses of the answering mechanism of the DBMS to his/her
queries, at the nodes traversed earlier, along any given run; this knowledge is
completed at the same node, with further relational deductions, possibly in
combination with 'public' information from other databases given in advance. A
'blackbox' mechanism is also part of a DLTTS, and it is meant as an oracle; its
role is to tell if the private information has been deduced by the adversary at
the current node, and if so terminate the run. An additional special feature is
that the blackbox also gives information on how 'close', or how 'far', the
knowledge of the adversary is, from the private information P , at the current
node. A metric is defined for that purpose, on the set of all 'type compatible'
tuples from the given database, the data themselves being typed with the
headers of the base. Despite the transition systems flavor of our framework,
this metric is not 'behavioral' in the sense presented in some other works. It
is exclusively database oriented, and allows to define new notions of adjacency

based on the Hamming metric (and a restricted notion of adjacency). Examples
are given all along to illustrate how our framework works.

Its core idea is to involve human in the loop of EMO. After every several
iterations, the DM is invited to elicit her feedback with regard to a couple of
incumbent candidates. By collecting such information, her preference is
progressively learned by a learning-to-rank neural network and then applied to
guide the baseline EMO algorithm. Note that this framework is so general that
any existing EMO algorithm can be applied in a plug-in manner. Experiments on
$48$ benchmark test problems with up to 10 objectives fully demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms for finding SOI.

(IGA) setting is considered and in particular B-splines and NURBS functions are
taken into account. In order to exploit all the possible benefits from using
spline spaces, an important point is the development of specific cubature
formulas for weakly and nearly singular integrals. Our proposal for this aim is
based on spline quasi-interpolation and on the use of a spline product formula.
Besides that, a robust singularity extraction procedure is introduced as a
preliminary step and an efficient function-by-function assembly phase is
adopted. A selection of numerical examples confirms that the numerical

between training and testing data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any testing
sample. This task is particularly important for deep models when the test
environment changes frequently. Although some recent attempts have been made to
handle this task, we still face two practical challenges: 1) existing methods
have to perform backward computation for each test sample, resulting in
unbearable prediction cost to many applications; 2) while existing TTA
solutions can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution
data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution
data after TTA (known as catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we point out
that not all the test samples contribute equally to model adaptation, and
high-entropy ones may lead to noisy gradients that could disrupt the model.
Motivated by this, we propose an active sample selection criterion to identify
reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize
the entropy loss for test-time adaptation. Furthermore, to alleviate the
forgetting issue, we introduce a Fisher regularizer to constrain important
model parameters from drastic changes, where the Fisher importance is estimated
from test samples with generated pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

generalizable person re-identification. However, synthesized persons in
existing datasets are mostly cartoon-like and in random dress collocation,
which limits their performance. To address this, in this work, an automatic
approach is proposed to directly clone the whole outfits from real-world person
images to virtual 3D characters, such that any virtual person thus created will
appear very similar to its real-world counterpart. Specifically, based on UV
texture mapping, two cloning methods are designed, namely registered clothes
mapping and homogeneous cloth expansion. Given clothes keypoints detected on
person images and labeled on regular UV maps with clear clothes structures,
registered mapping applies perspective homography to warp real-world clothes to
the counterparts on the UV map. As for invisible clothes parts and irregular UV
maps, homogeneous expansion segments a homogeneous area on clothes as a
realistic cloth pattern or cell, and expand the cell to fill the UV map.
Furthermore, a similarity-diversity expansion strategy is proposed, by
clustering person images, sampling images per cluster, and cloning outfits for
3D character generation. This way, virtual persons can be scaled up densely in
visual similarity to challenge model learning, and diversely in population to
enrich sample distribution. Finally, by rendering the cloned characters in
Unity3D scenes, a more realistic virtual dataset called ClonedPerson is
created, with 5,621 identities and 887,766 images. Experimental results show
that the model trained on ClonedPerson has a better generalization performance,
superior to that trained on other popular real-world and synthetic person
re-identification datasets. The ClonedPerson project is available at

coupling an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the high-order spectral (HOS)
method. In this work, we continue to enrich the method by allowing it to
simultaneously estimate the ocean current field, which is in general not known
a priori and can (slowly) vary in both space and time. To achieve this goal, we
incorporate the effect of ocean current (as unknown parameters) on waves to
build the HOS-C method as the forward prediction model, and obtain a
simultaneous estimation of (current) parameters and (wave) states via an
iterative EnKF (IEnKF) method that is necessary to handle the complexity in
this DA problem. The new algorithm, named IEnKF-HOS-C method, is first tested
in synthetic problems with various forms (steady/unsteady, uniform/non-uniform)
of current. It is shown that the IEnKF-HOS-C method is able to not only
estimate the current field accurately, but also boost the prediction accuracy
of the wave field (even) relative to the state-of-the-art EnKF-HOS method.
Finally, using real data from a shipborne radar, we show that the IEnKF-HOS-C
method successfully recovers the current speed that matches the in situ

systems (DES) under non-deterministic observations. Non-deterministic
observation is a general observation model that includes the case of
intermittent loss of observations. In this setting, upon the occurrence of an
event, the sensor reading may be non-deterministic such that a set of output
symbols are all possible. Existing works on fault diagnosis under
non-deterministic observations require to consider all possible observation
realizations. However, this approach includes the case where some possible
outputs are permanently disabled. In this work, we introduce the concept of
output fairness by requiring that, for any output symbols, if it has infinite
chances to be generated, then it will indeed be generated infinite number of
times. We use an assume-guarantee type of linear temporal logic formulas to
formally describe this assumption. A new notion called output-fair
diagnosability (OF-diagnosability) is proposed. An effective approach is
provided for the verification of OF-diagnosability. We show that the proposed
notion of OF-diagnosability is weaker than the standard definition of
diagnosability under non-deterministic observations, and it better captures the
physical scenario of observation non-determinism or intermittent loss of
observations.

code mostly as a black box. The connection between both worlds is typically
established with log messages: the developer provides hints to the (unknown)
operator, where the cause of an occurred issue is, and vice versa, the operator
can report bugs during operation. To fulfil this purpose, developers write log
instructions that are structured text commonly composed of a log level (e.g.,
""info"", ""error""), static text (""IP {} cannot be reached""), and dynamic
variables (e.g. IP {}). However, as opposed to well-adopted coding practices,
there are no widely adopted guidelines on how to write log instructions with
good quality properties. For example, a developer may assign a high log level
(e.g., ""error"") for a trivial event that can confuse the operator and increase
maintenance costs. Or the static text can be insufficient to hint at a specific
issue. In this paper, we address the problem of log quality assessment and
provide the first step towards its automation. We start with an in-depth
analysis of quality log instruction properties in nine software systems and
identify two quality properties: 1) correct log level assignment assessing the
correctness of the log level, and 2) sufficient linguistic structure assessing
the minimal richness of the static text necessary for verbose event
description. Based on these findings, we developed a data-driven approach that
adapts deep learning methods for each of the two properties. An extensive
evaluation on large-scale open-source systems shows that our approach correctly
assesses log level assignments with an accuracy of 0.88, and the sufficient
linguistic structure with an F1 score of 0.99, outperforming the baselines. Our
study shows the potential of the data-driven methods in assessing instructions
quality and aid developers in comprehending and writing better code.

the most pressing quests in astrophysics. We show that if isolated binary
evolution dominates the formation mechanism of merging binary black holes, one
should expect a correlation between the effective spin parameter,
$\chi_\mathrm{eff}$, and the redshift of the merger, $z$, of binary black
holes. This correlation comes from tidal spin-up systems preferentially forming
and merging at higher redshifts due to the combination of weaker orbital
expansion from low metallicity stars given their reduced wind mass loss rate,
delayed expansion and have smaller maximal radii during the supergiant phase
compared to stars at higher metallicity. As a result, these tightly bound
systems merge with short inspiral times. Given our fiducial model of isolated
binary evolution, we show that the origin of a $\chi_\mathrm{eff}-z$
correlation in the detectable LIGO--Virgo binary black hole population is
different from the intrinsic population, which will become accessible only in
the future by third-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Einstein
Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Finally, we compare our model predictions with
population predictions based on the current catalog of binary black hole
mergers and find that current data favor a positive correlation of
$\chi_\mathrm{eff}-z$ as predicted by our model of isolated binary evolution.

instance ambiguity, which may lead to a biased source distribution and severely
degrade the performance of the domain adaptive detector de facto. In this
paper, we represent the first effort to formulate noisy DAOD and propose a

incorporates the semantic information into the discrimination process and
enforces the gradients provided by noisy and clean samples to be consistent

benchmark DAOD datasets with noisy source annotations validates the
effectiveness of NLTE. In particular, NLTE improves the mAP by 8.4\% under 60\%

induced by static random distribution of the molecular transition frequencies)

of the collective molecular excitation and suppress superradiant emission.
However, fast stochastic modulation of the molecular excitation energy can
effectively restore the coherence of the quantum emitters and lead to a
recovery of superradiant emission, which is an unexpected manifestation of
motional narrowing. For a light scattering process as induced by an

fluorescence emission at the average excitation energy at long times and

received top solutions especially from industrial tech companies like Meituan,

structure, that provides valuable clues on how an original message is
transmitted and responded by users over time. Recent studies reveal that rumor
detection and stance detection are two different but relevant tasks which can
jointly enhance each other, e.g., rumors can be debunked by cross-checking the
stances conveyed by their relevant microblog posts, and stances are also
conditioned on the nature of the rumor. However, most stance detection methods
require enormous post-level stance labels for training, which are
labor-intensive given a large number of posts. Enlightened by Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) scheme, we first represent the diffusion of claims with
bottom-up and top-down trees, then propose two tree-structured weakly
supervised frameworks to jointly classify rumors and stances, where only the
bag-level labels concerning claim's veracity are needed. Specifically, we
convert the multi-class problem into a multiple MIL-based binary classification
problem where each binary model focuses on differentiating a target stance or
rumor type and other types. Finally, we propose a hierarchical attention
mechanism to aggregate the binary predictions, including (1) a bottom-up or
top-down tree attention layer to aggregate binary stances into binary veracity;
and (2) a discriminative attention layer to aggregate the binary class into
finer-grained classes. Extensive experiments conducted on three Twitter-based
datasets demonstrate promising performance of our model on both claim-level
rumor detection and post-level stance classification compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, they propose iterative language modeling module (IterLM) to

Though achieving promising results, the vision modeling module has become the
performance bottleneck of these methods. In this paper, we newly propose

Specifically, the first VM directly extracts multi-level features from the

data problem. In reality, the prosperity of FL is largely due to a centralized
framework called FedAvg, in which workers are in charge of model training and
servers are in control of model aggregation. However, FedAvg's centralized
worker-server architecture has raised new concerns, be it the low scalability
of the cluster, the risk of data leakage, and the failure or even defection of
the central server. To overcome these problems, we propose Decentralized
Federated Trusted Averaging (DeFTA), a decentralized FL framework that serves
as a plug-and-play replacement for FedAvg, instantly bringing better security,

performance analysis, and a decentralized trust system (DTS) to greatly improve
system robustness. Note that since DeFTA is an alternative to FedAvg at the

society increasingly relies on complex software systems running on the cloud.
To improve it, cloud providers are automating various maintenance tasks, with
failure identification frequently being considered. The precondition for
automation is the availability of observability tools, with system logs
commonly being used. The focus of this paper is log-based failure
identification. This problem is challenging because of the instability of the
log data and the incompleteness of the explicit logging failure coverage within
the code. To address the two challenges, we present CLog as a method for
failure identification. The key idea presented herein based is on our
observation that by representing the log data as sequences of subprocesses
instead of sequences of log events, the effect of the unstable log data is
reduced. CLog introduces a novel subprocess extraction method that uses
context-aware neural network and clustering methods to extract meaningful
subprocesses. The direct modeling of log event contexts allows the
identification of failures with respect to the abrupt context changes,
addressing the challenge of insufficient logging failure coverage. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the learned subprocesses representations
reduce the instability in the input, allowing CLog to outperform the baselines
on the failure identification subproblems - 1) failure detection by 9-24% on F1
score and 2) failure type identification by 7% on the macro averaged F1 score.
Further analysis shows the existent negative correlation between the
instability in the input event sequences and the detection performance in a
model-agnostic manner.

paper theoretically analyzes the information-geometric optimization framework

the candidate sampling distribution is used as the measure of progress of the
algorithm. We assume that the surrogate function is maintained so that the
population version of the Kendall's rank correlation coefficient between the
surrogate function and the objective function under the candidate sampling

information-geometric optimization using such a surrogate function leads to a
monotonic decrease in the expected objective function value if the threshold is
sufficiently close to one. The acceptable threshold value is analyzed for the
case of the information-geometric optimization instantiated with Gaussian
distributions, i.e., the rank-$\mu$ update CMA-ES, on a convex quadratic
objective function. As an alternative to the Kendall's rank correlation

parameter can be a non-zero scalar, a full-rank square matrix, or, more
generally, a bijective bounded linear operator. We demonstrate that the
positivity requirement is essentially due to a quadratic form. We prove several
key characterizations for the new form in a generic way (with an operator
parameter). We establish the optimal choice of parameter for the
Douglas-Rachford type methods by solving a simple unconstrained optimization
problem. The optimality is in the sense that a non-ergodic worst-case
convergence rate bound is minimized. We provide closed-form optimal choices for
scalar and orthogonal matrix parameters under zero initialization.
Additionally, a simple self-contained proof of a sharp linear convergence rate
for a $ (1/L) $-cocoercive fixed-point sequence with $ L\in(0,1) $ is provided
(as a preliminary result).
  To our knowledge, an operator parameter is new. To show its practical use, we
design a dedicated parameter for the 2-by-2 block-structured semidefinite
program (SDP). Such a structured SDP is strongly related to the quadratically
constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and we therefore expect the proposed
parameter to be of great potential use. At last, two well-known applications
are investigated. Numerical results show that the theoretical optimal
parameters are close to the practical optimums, except they are not a priori
knowledge. We then demonstrate that, by exploiting problem model structures,
the theoretical optimums can be well approximated. Such approximations turn out
to work very well, and in some cases almost reach the underlying limits.

thioformaldehyde in several starless cores located in star-forming filaments of
Taurus, Perseus, and Orion. We investigate the influence of the environmental
conditions on the abundances of these molecules in the cores, and the effect of
time evolution. We have modelled the observed lines of H2CS, HDCS, and D2CS
using the radiative transfer code RADEX. We have also used the chemical code
Nautilus to model the evolution of these species depending on the
characteristics of the starless cores. We derive column densities and
abundances for all the cores. We also derive deuterium fractionation ratios,
Dfrac, to determine and compare the evolutionary stage between different parts
of each star-forming region. Our results indicate that the north region of the
B213 filament in Taurus is more evolved than the south, while the north-eastern
part of Perseus presents an earlier evolutionary stage than the south-western
zone. Model results also show that Dfrac decreases with the cosmic-ray
ionisation rate, while it increases with density and with the degree of sulphur
depletion. In particular, we only reproduce the observations when the initial
sulphur abundance in the starless cores is at least one order of magnitude
lower than the solar elemental sulphur abundance. The progressive increase in
HDCS/H2CS and D2CS/H2CS with time makes these ratios powerful tools for
deriving the chemical evolutionary stage of starless cores. However, they
cannot be used to derive the temperature of these regions, since both ratios
present a similar evolution at two different temperature ranges (7-11 K and
15-19 K). Regarding chemistry, (deuterated) thioformaldehyde is mainly formed
through gas-phase reactions (double-replacement and neutral-neutral
displacement reactions), while surface chemistry plays an important role as a
destruction mechanism.

$x$ and $y$ simultaneously or alternatingly. However, two major limitations
have been reported in existing approaches. (I) As the influence of the
interaction term between $x$ and $y$ (e.g., $x^\mathrm{T} B y$) on the
Lipschitz smooth and strongly convex-concave function $f$ increases, the
approaches converge to an optimal solution at a slower rate. (II) The

convex-concave around the optimal solution. To address these difficulties, we
propose minimizing the worst-case objective function $F(x)=\max_{y}f(x,y)$
directly using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, in which
the rankings of solution candidates are approximated by our proposed worst-case

numerical experiments show two important findings regarding our proposed

data-driven analysis in cyber-physical critical infrastructures. Since the FL
process may involve the client's confidential information, Differential Privacy

we find that while DP greatly alleviates the privacy concerns, the additional
DP-noise opens a new threat for model poisoning in FL. Nonetheless, very little
effort has been made in the literature to investigate this adversarial
exploitation of the DP-noise. To overcome this gap, in this paper, we present a
novel adaptive model poisoning technique {\alpha}-MPELM} through which an
attacker can exploit the additional DP-noise to evade the state-of-the-art
anomaly detection techniques and prevent optimal convergence of the FL model.
We evaluate our proposed attack on the state-of-the-art anomaly detection
approaches in terms of detection accuracy and validation loss. The main
significance of our proposed {\alpha}-MPELM attack is that it reduces the
state-of-the-art anomaly detection accuracy by 6.8% for norm detection, 12.6%
for accuracy detection, and 13.8% for mix detection. Furthermore, we propose a
Reinforcement Learning-based DP level selection process to defend
{\alpha}-MPELM attack. The experimental results confirm that our defense
mechanism converges to an optimal privacy policy without human maneuver.

different domains, such as social computing and Internet of Things. However,
challenges arises for clustering networks with increased scale. This paper
proposes a solution which consists of two motif clustering techniques: standard
acceleration CHIEF-ST and approximate acceleration CHIEF-AP. Both algorithms
first find the maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs within the target networks to
lower the network scale, then employ higher-order motifs in clustering. In the
first procedure, we propose to lower the network scale by optimizing the
network structure with maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs. For CHIEF-ST, we
illustrate that all target motifs will be kept after this procedure when the
minimum node degree of the target motif is equal or greater than k. For
CHIEF-AP, we prove that the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix and the
Laplacian matrix are relatively stable after this step. That is, CHIEF-ST has
no influence on motif clustering, whereas CHIEF-AP introduces limited yet
acceptable impact. In the second procedure, we employ higher-order motifs,
i.e., heterogeneous four-node motifs clustering in higher-order dense networks.
The contributions of CHIEF are two-fold: (1) improved efficiency of motif
clustering for big networks; (2) verification of higher-order motif
significance. The proposed solutions are found to outperform baseline
approaches according to experiments on real and synthetic networks, which
demonstrates CHIEF's strength in large network analysis. Meanwhile,
higher-order motifs are proved to perform better than traditional triangle
motifs in clustering.

By leveraging the common variables observed in both data sets, doubly robust
estimation procedures are proposed in the literature to protect against
possible model misspecifications. However, they employ only a single propensity
score model for the data fusion process and a single imputation model for the
covariates available in one data set. It may be questionable to assume that
either model is correctly specified in practice. We therefore propose an
approach that calibrates multiple propensity score and imputation models to
gain more protection based on empirical likelihood methods. The resulting
estimator is consistent when any one of those models is correctly specified and
is robust against extreme values of the fitted propensity scores. We also
establish its asymptotic normality property and discuss the semiparametric
estimation efficiency. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimator has
substantial advantages over existing doubly robust estimators, and an assembled

many domains, and it is challenging to improve the efficiencies of applications
by accelerating the GCN trainings. For the sparsity nature and exploding scales
of input real-world graphs, state-of-the-art GCN training systems (e.g.,
GNNAdvisor) employ graph processing techniques to accelerate the message
exchanging (i.e. aggregations) among the graph vertices. Nevertheless, these
systems treat both the aggregation stages of forward and backward propagation
phases as all-active graph processing procedures that indiscriminately conduct
computation on all vertices of an input graph.
  In this paper, we first point out that in a GCN training problem with a given
training set, the aggregation stages of its backward propagation phase (called
as backward aggregations in this paper) can be converted to partially-active
graph processing procedures, which conduct computation on only partial vertices
of the input graph. By leveraging such a finding, we propose an execution path
preparing method that collects and coalesces the data used during backward
propagations of GCN training conducted on GPUs. The experimental results show
that compared with GNNAdvisor, our approach improves the performance of the
backward aggregation of GCN trainings on typical real-world graphs by
1.48x~5.65x. Moreover, the execution path preparing can be conducted either
before the training (during preprocessing) or on-the-fly with the training.
When used during preprocessing, our approach improves the overall GCN training
by 1.05x~1.37x. And when used on-the-fly, our approach improves the overall GCN
training by 1.03x~1.35x.

earlier stages. In this paper, we propose an End-to-End framework for
Flow-Guided Video Inpainting (E$^2$FGVI) through elaborately designed three
trainable modules, namely, flow completion, feature propagation, and content
hallucination modules. The three modules correspond with the three stages of
previous flow-based methods but can be jointly optimized, leading to a more
efficient and effective inpainting process. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both
qualitatively and quantitatively and shows promising efficiency. The code is

of a fast moving jet-like structure and a slowly expanding isotropic shell.
This model can account for the multi-wavelength spectra of Cas A, especially
for the power-law hard X-ray spectrum from $\sim$ 60 to 220 keV. The GeV to TeV
emission from Cas A should be contributed by both hadronic and leptonic

Willems' fundamental lemma, restricted behaviors are viewed as subspaces of
fixed dimension, which may be represented by data matrices. Consequently,
metrics between restricted behaviors are defined as distances between points on
the Grassmannian, i.e., the set of all subspaces of equal dimension in a given
vector space. A new metric is defined on the set of restricted behaviors as a
direct finite-time counterpart of the classical gap metric. The metric is shown
to capture parametric uncertainty for the class of autoregressive (AR) models.
Numerical simulations illustrate the value of the new metric with a data-driven

bisulfate, as verified using our calculated projected density of states, bond
lengths, and on-site magnetic moments. On the other hand, in Fe and Co
bisulfates, cationic redox dominates the initial delithiation (1 $\leq$ x

reveals insignificant bonding between oxidizing O atoms throughout the
delithiation process in the Ni bisulfate, indicating robust battery performance

  This paper proposes SecureBERT, a cybersecurity language model capable of
capturing text connotations in cybersecurity text (e.g., CTI) and therefore
successful in automation for many critical cybersecurity tasks that would
otherwise rely on human expertise and time-consuming manual efforts. SecureBERT
has been trained using a large corpus of cybersecurity text.To make SecureBERT
effective not just in retaining general English understanding, but also when
applied to text with cybersecurity implications, we developed a customized

evaluated using the standard Masked Language Model (MLM) test as well as two
additional standard NLP tasks. Our evaluation studies show that

information about the patient condition and patient care as they occur in time.
Recent years have witnessed increased interest of machine learning community in
developing machine learning models solving different types of problems defined
upon information in EHRs. More recently, neural sequential models, such as RNN
and LSTM, became popular and widely applied models for representing patient
sequence data and for predicting future events or outcomes based on such data.
However, a single neural sequential model may not properly represent complex
dynamics of all patients and the differences in their behaviors. In this work,
we aim to alleviate this limitation by refining a one-fits-all model using a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The architecture consists of multiple
(expert) RNN models covering patient sub-populations and refining the
predictions of the base model. That is, instead of training expert RNN models
from scratch we define them on the residual signal that attempts to model the
differences from the population-wide model. The heterogeneity of various
patient sequences is modeled through multiple experts that consist of RNN.
Particularly, instead of directly training MoE from scratch, we augment MoE
based on the prediction signal from pretrained base GRU model. With this way,
the mixture of experts can provide flexible adaptation to the (limited)
predictive power of the single base RNN model. We experiment with the newly
proposed model on real-world EHRs data and the multivariate clinical event
prediction task. We implement RNN using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). We show
4.1% gain on AUPRC statistics compared to a single RNN prediction.

approximates the Newton direction through a generic fixed point method, e.g.,
Jacobi Overrelaxation, that does not involve Hessian inverses. We prove exact
global linear convergence of INDO and provide analytical studies on how the
degree of inexactness in the Newton direction calculation affects the overall

model. Depending on the background electric field, we observe accelerating,
steady and fading negative streamers. Fading occurs in low background fields,
in which negative streamers undergo a streamer-to-avalanche transition: their
field enhancement keeps decreasing and the streamer velocity becomes comparable
to the maximal electron drift velocity. Our focus is on the steady propagation
mode, during which streamer properties like radius and velocity hardly change.
However, this mode is unstable, in the sense that a small change in conditions
leads to acceleration or deceleration. We observe steady negative streamers in
background fields ranging from 9.19 kV/cm to 15.75 kV/cm, indicating that there
is no unique steady propagation field (or stability field). Another finding is
that steady negative streamers are able to keep propagating over tens of
centimeters, with only a finite conductive length behind their heads, similar
to steady positive streamers. Approximately linear relationships are observed
between the optical diameter and properties like the streamer velocity and the
streamer head potential. From these linear relations, we obtain rough lower
bounds of about 0.27 mm to 0.35 mm for the minimal optical diameter of steady
negative streamers. The lowest background field in which a steady negative
streamer could be obtained is 9.19 kV/cm. In contrast, steady positive
streamers have recently been obtained in a background field as low as 4.07
kV/cm. We find that the properties of steady negative and positive streamers
differ significantly. For example, for steady negative streamers the ratio
between streamer velocity and maximal electron drift velocity ranges from about
2 to 4.5, whereas for steady positive streamers this ratio ranges from about
0.05 to 0.26.

media (like water, liquid scintillator, etc). Using two 20"" MCP-PMTs and one
20"" dynode PMT, we demonstrate a complete procedure to obtain the key
parameters used in the model from experimental data, such as the optical
properties of the antireflective coating and photocathode of the three PMTs.
The proposed model can effectively reproduce the angular responses of the
quantum efficiency of PMTs, even though an ideally uniform photocathode is
assumed in the model. Interestingly, the proposed model predicts a similar
level ($20\%\sim30\%$) of light yield excess observed in the experimental data
of many liquid scintillator-based neutrino detectors, compared with that
predicted at the stage of detector design. However, this excess has never been
explained, and the proposed PMT model provides a good explanation for it, which
highlights the imperfections of PMT models used in their detector simulations.

objectives of ecology and conservation. Joint species distribution models use
multi-species detection-nondetection data to estimate species and community

correlations between species, imperfect detection, and spatial autocorrelation.
While methods exist to accommodate each of these complexities, there are few
examples in the literature that address and explore all three complexities
simultaneously. Here we developed a spatial factor multi-species occupancy
model to explicitly account for species correlations, imperfect detection, and
spatial autocorrelation. The proposed model uses a spatial factor dimension
reduction approach and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes to ensure
computational efficiency for data sets with both a large number of species
(e.g., > 100) and spatial locations (e.g., 100,000). We compare the proposed
model performance to five candidate models, each addressing a subset of the
three complexities. We implemented the proposed and competing models in the
spOccupancy software, designed to facilitate application via an accessible,
well-documented, and open-source R package. Using simulations, we found
ignoring the three complexities when present leads to inferior model predictive
performance. Using a case study on 98 bird species across the continental US,
the spatial factor multi-species occupancy model had the highest predictive
performance among the candidate models. Our proposed framework, together with
its implementation in spOccupancy, serves as a user-friendly tool to understand
spatial variation in species distributions and biodiversity metrics while

natural language processing. Text matching tasks share the same paradigm that
determines the relationship between two given texts. The relationships vary
from task to task, e.g.~relevance in document retrieval, semantic alignment in
paraphrase identification and answerable judgment in question answering.
However, the essential signals for text matching remain in a finite scope,
i.e.~exact matching, semantic matching, and inference matching. Ideally, a good
text matching model can learn to capture and aggregate these signals for
different matching tasks to achieve competitive performance, while recent
state-of-the-art text matching models, e.g.~Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs),
are hard to generalize. It is because the end-to-end supervised learning on
task-specific dataset makes model overemphasize the data sample bias and
task-specific signals instead of the essential matching signals. To overcome
this problem, we adopt a specialization-generalization training strategy and
refer to it as Match-Prompt. In specialization stage, descriptions of different
matching tasks are mapped to a few prompt tokens. In generalization stage,
matching model explores the essential matching signals by being trained on
diverse matching tasks. High diverse matching tasks avoid model fitting the
data bias on a specific task, so that model can focus on learning the essential
matching signals. Meanwhile, the prompt tokens obtained in the first step help
the model distinguish different task-specific matching signals. Experimental
results on public datasets show that Match-Prompt can improve multi-task
generalization capability of PLMs in text matching and yield better in-domain
multi-task, out-of-domain multi-task and new task adaptation performance than
multi-task and task-specific models trained by previous fine-tuning paradigm.

effective connectivity so obtained reproduces several features of cortical
regions in rats and monkeys and has similar network properties as the synaptic
network of the nematode C. elegans, the only organism whose entire nervous
system has been mapped out as of today. The distribution of the incoming degree
is bimodal and the distributions of the average incoming and outgoing synaptic
strength are non-Gaussian with long tails. The effective connectivity captures
different information from the commonly studied functional connectivity,
estimated using statistical correlation between spiking activities. The average
synaptic strengths of excitatory incoming and outgoing links are found to
increase with the spiking activity in the estimated effective connectivity but
not in the functional connectivity estimated using the same sets of voltage
measurements. These results thus demonstrate that the reconstructed effective
connectivity can capture the general properties of synaptic connections and
better reveal relationships between network structure and dynamics.

In addition, we extract multiple IR images of each PV module. Using our method,
we successfully map 99.3 % of the 35084 modules in four large-scale and one
rooftop plant and extract over 2.2 million module images. As compared to our
previous work, extraction misses 18 times less modules (one in 140 modules as
compared to one in eight). Furthermore, two or three plant rows can be
processed simultaneously, increasing module throughput and reducing flight
duration by a factor of 2.1 and 3.7, respectively. Comparison with an accurate
orthophoto of one of the large-scale plants yields a root mean square error of
the estimated module geocoordinates of 5.87 m and a relative error within each
plant row of 0.22 m to 0.82 m. Finally, we use the module geocoordinates and
extracted IR images to visualize distributions of module temperatures and
anomaly predictions of a deep learning classifier on a map. While the

properties of light. While strictly valid only in the thermal regime and in the
absence of correlations, this relation is routinely extended to the partially
coherent regime in the study of high-$\beta$ nanolasers, where it aids in the
identification of the lasing threshold. We re-evaluate the use of a generalized
Siegert relation in different device regimes. A full two-time quantum-optical
theory is derived as a reference for obtaining first- and second-order
correlation functions $g^{(1)}(\tau)$ and $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ in the steady state.
We find that even in the partially coherent regime the generalized Siegert
relation is well suited as an approximation to $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ as long as
emitter correlation are negligible, but does not apply well in the quantum
regime of few-emitter nanolasers, or to devices featuring sub- and superradiant

Analytical expressions reveal the conditions under which the echoes appear, and

successful quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). However, eliminating the
background field in brains containing significant susceptibility sources, such
as intracranial hemorrhages, is challenging due to the relatively large scale
of the field induced by these pathological susceptibility sources. Method: This
study proposes a new deep learning-based method, BFRnet, to remove background
field in healthy and hemorrhagic subjects. The network is built with the
dual-frequency octave convolutions on the U-net architecture, trained with
synthetic field maps containing significant susceptibility sources. The BFRnet
method is compared with three conventional BFR methods and one previous deep
learning method using simulated and in vivo brains from 4 healthy and 2
hemorrhagic subjects. Robustness against acquisition field-of-view (FOV)
orientation and brain masking are also investigated. Results: For both
simulation and in vivo experiments, BFRnet led to the best visually appealing
results in the local field and QSM results with the minimum contrast loss and
the most accurate hemorrhage susceptibility measurements among all five
methods. In addition, BFRnet produced the most consistent local field and
susceptibility maps between different sizes of brain masks, while conventional
methods depend drastically on precise brain extraction and further brain edge
erosions. It is also observed that BFRnet performed the best among all BFR
methods for acquisition FOVs oblique to the main magnetic field. Conclusion:
The proposed BFRnet improved the accuracy of local field reconstruction in the
hemorrhagic subjects compared with conventional BFR algorithms. The BFRnet
method was effective for acquisitions of titled orientations and retained whole
brains without edge erosion as often required by traditional BFR methods.

interactions in the velocity and temperature fields. The
constant-temperature-difference boundary condition is used so that the mean
velocity and temperature profiles are similar, and then the roles of interscale

turbulent energies and temperature-related statistics. We show that turbulent
heat transfer occurs at relatively small streamwise length scales compared to
momentum transfer, although molecular diffusion is more significant in the
temperature field as the Prandtl number is less than 1. Detailed analysis on
the transport budgets of the temperature-related spectra shows that scale
interactions in temperature field supply more energy to small scales than those
in velocity field. Such significant temperature cascade leads to more energetic
temperature fluctuation at small scales, which eventually results in the
dissimilarity between the spectra of turbulent heat and momentum transfers.

systematic dimensionality reduction methods are commonly employed. Among
others, this includes principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged
independent component analysis (TICA), which aim to maximize the variance and
the timescale of the first components, respectively. A crucial first step of
such an analysis is the identification of suitable and relevant input
coordinates (the so-called features), such as backbone dihedral angles and
interresidue distances. As typically only a small subset of those coordinates
is involved in a specific biomolecular process, it is important to discard the
remaining uncorrelated motions or weakly correlated noise coordinates. This is
because they may exhibit large amplitudes or long timescales and therefore will
be erroneously be considered important by PCA and TICA, respectively. To
discriminate collective motions underlying functional dynamics from
uncorrelated motions, the correlation matrix of the input coordinates is
block-diagonalized by a clustering method. This strategy avoids possible bias
due to presumed functional observables and conformational states or variation
principles that maximize variance or timescales. Considering several linear and
nonlinear correlation measures and various clustering algorithms, it is shown
that the combination of linear correlation and the Leiden community detection
algorithm yields excellent results for all considered model systems. These
include the functional motion of T4 lysozyme to demonstrate the successful
identification of collective motion, as well as the folding of villin headpiece
to highlight the physical interpretation of the correlated motions in terms of
a functional mechanism.

fuzzing can also be used in combination with a sanitizer, such as
AddressSanitizer (ASAN), to further enhance the detection of certain classes of
bugs such as buffer overflow and use-after-free errors. However, sanitizers
also introduce additional performance overheads, and this can degrade the
performance of greybox mode fuzzing -- measured in the order of 2.36X for
fuzzing with ASAN -- partially negating the benefit of using a sanitizer in the
first place. Recent research attributes the extra overhead to program
startup/teardown costs that can dominate fork-mode fuzzing.
  In this paper, we present a new memory error sanitizer design that is
specifically optimized for fork-mode fuzzing. The basic idea is to mark object
boundaries using randomized tokens rather than disjoint metadata (as used by
traditional sanitizer designs). All read/write operations are then instrumented
to check for the token, and if present, a memory error will be detected. Since
our design does not use a disjoint metadata, it is also very lightweight,
meaning that program startup and teardown costs are minimized for the benefit
of fork-mode fuzzing. We implement our design in the form of the ReZZan tool,
and show an improved fuzzing performance overhead of 1.14-1.27X, depending on

synchrotron polarization associated with neutral gas, as traced by atomic
hydrogen (HI) and dust. Here we present the first in-depth numerical study of
these LOFAR results. We produce and analyze comprehensive synthetic
observations of low-frequency synchrotron polarization from MHD simulations of
colliding super shells in the multiphase ISM. We define five distinct gas
phases over more than four orders of magnitude in gas temperature and density,
ranging from hot, and warm, fully ionized gas to cold neutral medium. We focus
on the contribution of each gas phase to synthetic observations of both
rotation measure and synchrotron polarized intensity below 200 MHz. We also
investigate the link between the latter and synthetic observations of optically
thin HI gas. We find that, not only the fully ionized gas but also the warm
partially ionized and neutral phases strongly contribute to the total rotation
measure and polarized intensity. However, the contribution of each phase to the
observables strongly depends on the choice of integration axis and the
orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shell-collision
axis. Strong correlation between HI synthetic data and synchrotron polarized
intensity, reminiscent of LOFAR results, is obtained with lines of sight
perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction. Our study suggests that
multiphase modelling of MHD processes is needed in order to interpret
observations of the radio sky at low frequency. This work is a first step
toward understanding the complexity of low-frequency synchrotron emission that
will be soon revolutionized by large-scale surveys with LOFAR and the SKA.

rendering. Can we keep things simple by just using more landmarks? In answer,
we present the first method that accurately predicts 10x as many landmarks as
usual, covering the whole head, including the eyes and teeth. This is
accomplished using synthetic training data, which guarantees perfect landmark
annotations. By fitting a morphable model to these dense landmarks, we achieve

orders of magnitude larger and more diverse. These new datasets differ
substantially in four aspects of complexity: 1. Chemical diversity (number of
different elements), 2. system size (number of atoms per sample), 3. dataset
size (number of data samples), and 4. domain shift (similarity of the training
and test set). Despite these large differences, benchmarks on small and narrow
datasets remain the predominant method of demonstrating progress in graph
neural networks (GNNs) for molecular simulation, likely due to cheaper training
compute requirements. This raises the question -- does GNN progress on small
and narrow datasets translate to these more complex datasets? This work
investigates this question by first developing the GemNet-OC model based on the
large Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset. GemNet-OC outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art on OC20 by 16% while reducing training time by a factor of 10.
We then compare the impact of 18 model components and hyperparameter choices on
performance in multiple datasets. We find that the resulting model would be
drastically different depending on the dataset used for making model choices.
To isolate the source of this discrepancy we study six subsets of the OC20
dataset that individually test each of the above-mentioned four dataset
aspects. We find that results on the OC-2M subset correlate well with the full
OC20 dataset while being substantially cheaper to train on. Our findings
challenge the common practice of developing GNNs solely on small datasets, but
highlight ways of achieving fast development cycles and generalizable results
via moderately-sized, representative datasets such as OC-2M and efficient
models such as GemNet-OC. Our code and pretrained model weights are

affected by the post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ describing the strength of
gravitational light deflection. We study both analytically and numerically how
a deviation in the PPN parameter $\gamma$ from unity, which is the value
predicted by general relativity, affects the parallax estimations in Gaia-like
astrometry. Changes in the observable quantities produced by a small variation
in PPN $\gamma$ were calculated analytically. We then considered how such
variations of the observables are reflected in the parallax estimations, and we
performed numerical simulations to check the theoretical predictions. A
variation in the PPN $\gamma$ results in a global shift of parallaxes and we
present a formula describing the parallax bias in terms of the satellite
barycentric distance, the angle between the spin axis and the direction to the
Sun, and the PPN $\gamma$ uncertainty. Numerical simulations of the astrometric
solutions confirm the theoretical result. The up-to-date estimation of PPN
$\gamma$ suggests that a corresponding contribution to the Gaia parallax zero
point unlikely exceeds 0.2 $\mu$as. The numerical simulations indicate that the
parallax shift is strongly dependent on ecliptic latitude. It is argued that
this effect is due to an asymmetry in the Gaia scanning law and this conclusion
is fully validated by additional simulations with a reversed direction of the
precession of the spin axis around the direction to the Sun.

some stress $\sigma^*$, beyond which cracks can propagate. Here we argue for a
flat interface that disorder is a relevant perturbation to this description. We
justify why the distribution of slip contains two parts: a powerlaw
corresponding to `avalanches', and a `narrow' distribution of system-spanning
`fracture' events. We derive novel scaling relations for avalanches, including
a relation between the stress drop and the spatial extension of a slip event.
We compute the cut-off length beyond which avalanches cannot be stopped by

arbitrarily-viewed one. The main contribution of this paper is a frontalization
methodology that preserves non-rigid facial deformations in order to boost the
performance of visually assisted speech communication. The method alternates
between the estimation of (i)~the rigid transformation (scale, rotation, and
translation) and (ii)~the non-rigid deformation between an arbitrarily-viewed
face and a face model. The method has two important merits: it can deal with
non-Gaussian errors in the data and it incorporates a dynamical face
deformation model. For that purpose, we use the generalized Student
t-distribution in combination with a linear dynamic system in order to account
for both rigid head motions and time-varying facial deformations caused by
speech production. We propose to use the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation
(ZNCC) score to evaluate the ability of the method to preserve facial
expressions. The method is thoroughly evaluated and compared with several state
of the art methods, either based on traditional geometric models or on deep
learning. Moreover, we show that the method, when incorporated into deep
learning pipelines, namely lip reading and speech enhancement, improves word
recognition and speech intelligibilty scores by a considerable margin.

to the unlabeled target domain without accessing the well-labeled source data,
which is a much more practical setting due to the data privacy, security, and
transmission issues. To make up for the absence of source data, most existing
methods introduced feature prototype based pseudo-labeling strategies to
realize self-training model adaptation. However, feature prototypes are
obtained by instance-level predictions based feature clustering, which is
category-biased and tends to result in noisy labels since the visual domain
gaps between source and target are usually different between categories. In
addition, we found that a monocentric feature prototype may be ineffective to
represent each category and introduce negative transfer, especially for those
hard-transfer data. To address these issues, we propose a general
class-Balanced Multicentric Dynamic prototype (BMD) strategy for the SFDA task.
Specifically, for each target category, we first introduce a global inter-class
balanced sampling strategy to aggregate potential representative target
samples. Then, we design an intra-class multicentric clustering strategy to
achieve more robust and representative prototypes generation. In contrast to
existing strategies that update the pseudo label at a fixed training period, we
further introduce a dynamic pseudo labeling strategy to incorporate network
update information during model adaptation. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed model-agnostic BMD strategy significantly improves representative SFDA
methods to yield new state-of-the-art results. The code is available at

often under time pressure to conduct analysis and adopted three modes of
collaboration: independently analyze different portions of the data and then
collaborate, collaboratively analyze the session with little or no independent
analysis, and independently analyze the same set of data and then collaborate.
Moreover, most encountered challenges related to lack of resources,
disagreements with colleagues regarding usability problems, and difficulty
merging analysis from multiple practitioners. We discuss design implications to
better support collaborative data analysis.

  Refinement Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face inpainting aims to complete the corrupted regions of the face images,
which requires coordination between the completed areas and the non-corrupted
areas. Recently, memory-oriented methods illustrate great prospects in the
generation related tasks by introducing an external memory module to improve
image coordination. However, such methods still have limitations in restoring
the consistency and continuity for specificfacial semantic parts. In this
paper, we propose the coarse-to-fine Memory-Disentangled Refinement Networks
(MDRNets) for coordinated face inpainting, in which two collaborative modules
are integrated, Disentangled Memory Module (DMM) and Mask-Region Enhanced
Module (MREM). Specifically, the DMM establishes a group of disentangled memory
blocks to store the semantic-decoupled face representations, which could
provide the most relevant information to refine the semantic-level
coordination. The MREM involves a masked correlation mining mechanism to
enhance the feature relationships into the corrupted regions, which could also
make up for the correlation loss caused by memory disentanglement. Furthermore,
to better improve the inter-coordination between the corrupted and
non-corrupted regions and enhance the intra-coordination in corrupted regions,
we design InCo2 Loss, a pair of similarity based losses to constrain the
feature consistency. Eventually, extensive experiments conducted on CelebA-HQ
and FFHQ datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MDRNets compared with
previous State-Of-The-Art methods.

image understanding and made a great success. Nevertheless, most of the
existing deep models are initialized with the ImageNet pretrained weights.
Since natural images inevitably present a large domain gap relative to aerial
images, probably limiting the finetuning performance on downstream aerial scene
tasks. This issue motivates us to conduct an empirical study of remote sensing
pretraining (RSP) on aerial images. To this end, we train different networks
from scratch with the help of the largest RS scene recognition dataset up to
now -- MillionAID, to obtain a series of RS pretrained backbones, including
both convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers such as Swin
and ViTAE, which have shown promising performance on computer vision tasks.
Then, we investigate the impact of RSP on representative downstream tasks
including scene recognition, semantic segmentation, object detection, and
change detection using these CNN and vision transformer backbones. Empirical
study shows that RSP can help deliver distinctive performances in scene
recognition tasks and in perceiving RS related semantics such as ""Bridge"" and
""Airplane"". We also find that, although RSP mitigates the data discrepancies of
traditional ImageNet pretraining on RS images, it may still suffer from task
discrepancies, where downstream tasks require different representations from
scene recognition tasks. These findings call for further research efforts on
both large-scale pretraining datasets and effective pretraining methods. The
codes and pretrained models will be released at

65.3% of CSSCI-indexed journals have created WeChat public accounts and posted
over 193 thousand WeChat posts in total. At the journal level, bibliometric
indicators (e.g., citations, downloads, and journal impact factors) and WeChat
indicators (e.g., clicks, likes, replies, and recommendations) are weakly
correlated with each other, reinforcing the idea of fundamentally
differentiated dimensions of indicators between bibliometrics and social media

outperform those without WeChat public accounts in terms of citation impact,
suggesting that the WeChat presence of scientific journals is mostly positively

Scholze-Weinstein proved this conjecture when $(G, b, \mu)$ is of (P)EL type by

for the multipole scattering coefficients of the resonator are derived, valid
at low frequencies, with three fundamental configurations examined in detail:
the thin-walled, moderately thick-walled, and very thick-walled limits.
Additionally, we examine the impact of dissipation for very thick-walled
resonators, and also numerically evaluate the scattering, absorption, and
extinction cross sections (efficiencies) for representative resonators in all
three wall thickness regimes. In general, we observe strong enhancement in both
the scattered fields and cross sections at the Helmholtz resonance frequencies.
As expected, dissipation is shown to shift the resonance frequency, reduce the
amplitude of the field, and reduce the extinction efficiency at the fundamental
Helmholtz resonance. Finally, we confirm results in the literature on
Willis-like coupling effects for this resonator design, and crucially, connect
these findings to earlier works by the authors on two-dimensional arrays of
resonators, deducing that depolarisability effects (off-diagonal terms) for a

isogeometric analysis (IGA) and the tensor train (TT) decomposition for the
approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) on parameter-dependent
geometries. First, the discrete Galerkin operator as well as the solution for a
fixed geometry configuration are represented as tensors and the TT format is
employed to reduce their computational complexity. Parametric dependencies are
included by considering the parameters that control the geometry configuration
as additional dimensions next to the physical space coordinates. The parameters
are easily incorporated within the TT-IGA solution framework by introducing a
tensor product basis expansion in the parameter space. The discrete Galerkin
operators are accordingly extended to accommodate the parameter dependence,
thus obtaining a single system that includes the parameter dependency. The
system is solved directly in the TT format and a low-rank representation of the
parameter-dependent solution is obtained. The proposed TT-IGA solver is applied
to several test cases which showcase its high computational efficiency and

  Adversarial Training","NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing deep learning real denoising methods require a large amount of
noisy-clean image pairs for supervision. Nonetheless, capturing a real
noisy-clean dataset is an unacceptable expensive and cumbersome procedure. To
alleviate this problem, this work investigates how to generate realistic noisy
images. Firstly, we formulate a simple yet reasonable noise model that treats
each real noisy pixel as a random variable. This model splits the noisy image
generation problem into two sub-problems: image domain alignment and noise
domain alignment. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework, namely
Pixel-level Noise-aware Generative Adversarial Network (PNGAN). PNGAN employs a
pre-trained real denoiser to map the fake and real noisy images into a nearly
noise-free solution space to perform image domain alignment. Simultaneously,
PNGAN establishes a pixel-level adversarial training to conduct noise domain
alignment. Additionally, for better noise fitting, we present an efficient
architecture Simple Multi-scale Network (SMNet) as the generator. Qualitative
validation shows that noise generated by PNGAN is highly similar to real noise
in terms of intensity and distribution. Quantitative experiments demonstrate
that a series of denoisers trained with the generated noisy images achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four real denoising benchmarks. Part of
codes, pre-trained models, and results are available at

pandemic. They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce
the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However,
their potential for attenuating long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection,
commonly denoted as Long COVID, remains elusive and is still subject of debate.
Such long-term effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by
analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors.
Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity,
and sleep duration in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by
vaccination status. Data was collected over a period of two years in the
context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with currently around
190,000 monthly active donors. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we
find that vaccinated individuals on average experience smaller changes in their
vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme
changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently
in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can
mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms
of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large
scale, high-resolution wearable sensor data in public health research.

determining the physical properties of materials. Berry curvature and Chern
number are used to define the topological structure of electronic bands. While
Berry curvature and its effects in materials have been studied, detecting
changes in the topological invariant, Chern number, is challenging. In this
regard, twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) has emerged as a promising
platform to gain electrical control over the Berry curvature hotspots and the
valley Chern numbers of its flat bands. In addition, strain induced breaking of
the three-fold rotation (C3) symmetry in TDBG, leads to a non-zero first moment
of Berry curvature called the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which can be sensed
using nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect. We reveal, using TDBG, that the BCD detects
topological transitions in the bands and changes its sign. In TDBG, the
perpendicular electric field tunes the valley Chern number and the BCD
simultaneously allowing us a tunable system to probe the physics of topological
transitions. Furthermore, we find hysteresis of longitudinal and NLH responses
with electric field that can be attributed to switching of electric
polarization in moir\'e systems. Such a hysteretic response holds promise for
next-generation Berry curvature-based memory devices. Probing topological
transitions, as we show, can be emulated in other 3D topological systems.

However, different parts of a semantic object (e.g., wheel and window of car)
are quite different in structures and textures, making blurry synthesis results
usually inevitable due to the missing of fine-grained guidance. In this paper,
we propose a novel normalization module, termed as REtrieval-based Spatially
AdaptIve normaLization (RESAIL), for introducing pixel level fine-grained
guidance to the normalization architecture. Specifically, we first present a
retrieval paradigm by finding a content patch of the same semantic class from
training set with the most similar shape to each test semantic mask. Then,
RESAIL is presented to use the retrieved patch for guiding the feature
normalization of corresponding region, and can provide pixel level fine-grained
guidance, thereby greatly mitigating blurry synthesis results. Moreover,
distorted ground-truth images are also utilized as alternatives of
retrieval-based guidance for feature normalization, further benefiting model
training and improving visual quality of generated images. Experiments on
several challenging datasets show that our RESAIL performs favorably against

overcome is the rigidity of the complex objects, since the transfer operator is

non-uniformly hyperbolic and one may have critical points on the Julia set. The

To avoid the online computational burden in most existing methods, we learn a
parameterized function offline to approximate the primal estimate. Meanwhile, a
dual estimator is trained to check the suboptimality of the primal estimator
during execution time. Both the primal and dual estimators are learned from
data using supervised learning techniques, and the explicit sample size is
provided, which enables us to guarantee the quality of each learned estimator
in terms of feasibility and optimality. This in turn allows us to bound the
probability of the learned estimator being infeasible or suboptimal.
Furthermore, we analyze the stability of the resulting estimator with a bounded
error in the minimization of the cost function. Since our algorithm does not
require the solution of an optimization problem during runtime, state estimates
can be generated online almost instantly. Simulation results are presented to
show the accuracy and time efficiency of the proposed framework compared to
online optimization of moving horizon estimation and Kalman filter. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based state estimator with

atoms and a traveling-wave light. It is demonstrated that spin-orbit coupling

interaction. The strong optical driving removes perturbation from the Doppler
effect and back action effect to access the coherent system. In this process,
superposition of distant matter waves connected to the arbitrary distribution
of atom internal state could be predicted, which is important for the
realization of atom interferometry and quantum state operation. The influence
from atom relaxation and atom-atom interactions are discussed. Basic conditions
of experimental design are given in the end of this work.

information it carries is scrambled. Wavefront shaping can undo this
scrambling, typically one spatial mode at a time - enabling deployment of MMFs
as ultra-thin micro-endoscopes. In this work we go beyond serial wavefront
shaping by showing how to simultaneously unscramble all spatial modes emerging
from an MMF in parallel. We introduce a passive multiple-scattering element -
crafted through the process of inverse design - that is complementary to an MMF
and undoes its optical effects. This optical inverter makes possible both
single-shot wide-field imaging and super-resolution imaging through MMFs. Our
design consists of a cascade of diffractive elements, and can be understood
from the perspective of both multi-plane light conversion, and as a physically
inspired deep diffractive neural network. This physical architecture can
outperform state-of-the-art electronic neural networks tasked with unscrambling
light, as it preserves the phase and coherence information of the optical
signals flowing through it. Here we demonstrate our MMF inversion concept
through numerical simulations, and efficiently sort and unscramble up to ~400
step-index fibre modes, reforming incoherent images of scenes at arbitrary
distances from the distal fibre facet. We also describe how our optical
inverter can dynamically adapt to see through flexible fibres with a range of
experimentally realistic TMs - made possible by moulding optical memory effects
into the structure of our design. Although complex, our inversion scheme is
based on current fabrication technology so could be realised in the near
future. Beyond imaging through scattering media, these concepts open up a range
of new avenues for optical multiplexing, communications and computation in the
realms of classical and quantum photonics.

in the blue wavelength region. Radioluminescent properties of PEN have been
measured to aid in the evaluation of this material. In this article we present
a measurement of PEN's quenching factor using three different neutron sources;
neutrons emitted from spontaneous fission in \cf, neutrons generated from a DD

The fission source used time-of-flight to determine the neutron energy, and the
neutron energy from the nuclear reactions was defined using thin targets and
reaction kinematics. The Birk's factor and scintillation efficiency were found
to be $kB = 0.12 \pm 0.01$ mm MeV$^{-1}$ and $S = 1.31\pm0.09$ MeV$_{ee}$

computational mathematics and become increasingly important in engineering
applications. After the discretization, many of inverse problems are reduced to
linear systems. Due to the typical ill-posedness of inverse problems, the
reduced linear systems are often ill-posed, especially when their scales are
large. This brings great computational difficulty. Particularly, a small
perturbation in the right side of an ill-posed linear system may cause a
dramatical change in the solution. Therefore, regularization methods should be
adopted for stable solutions. In this paper, a new class of accelerated
iterative regularization methods is applied to solve this kind of large-scale
ill-posed linear systems. An iterative scheme becomes a regularization method
only when the iteration is early terminated. And a Morozov's discrepancy
principle is applied for the stop criterion. Compared with the conventional
Landweber iteration, the new methods have acceleration effect, and can be
compared to the well-known accelerated v-method and Nesterov method. From the
numerical results, it is observed that using appropriate discretization
schemes, the proposed methods even have better behavior when comparing with
v-method and Nesterov method.

  inferences",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: When planning a cluster randomized trial, evaluators often have
access to an enumerated cohort representing the target population of clusters.
Practicalities of conducting the trial, such as the need to oversample clusters
with certain characteristics to improve trial economy or to support inference
about subgroups of clusters, may preclude simple random sampling from the
cohort into the trial, and thus interfere with the goal of producing
generalizable inferences about the target population.
  Methods: We describe a nested trial design where the randomized clusters are
embedded within a cohort of trial-eligible clusters from the target population
and where clusters are selected for inclusion in the trial with known sampling
probabilities that may depend on cluster characteristics (e.g., allowing
clusters to be chosen to facilitate trial conduct or to examine hypotheses
related to their characteristics). We develop and evaluate methods for
analyzing data from this design to generalize causal inferences to the target
population underlying the cohort.
  Results: We present identification and estimation results for the expectation
of the average potential outcome and for the average treatment effect, in the
entire target population of clusters and in its non-randomized subset. In
simulation studies we show that different estimators have low bias but markedly
different precision.
  Conclusions: Cluster randomized trials where clusters are selected for
inclusion with known sampling probabilities that depend on cluster
characteristics, combined with efficient estimation methods, can precisely
quantify treatment effects in the target population, while addressing
objectives of trial conduct that require oversampling clusters on the basis of
their characteristics.

Currently, most approaches to designing such gates are based either on simple,
analytical pulse waveforms or on ones obtained from numerical optimization
techniques. In both cases, it is typically not possible to obtain a global
understanding of the space of waveforms that generate a target gate operation,
making it challenging to design globally optimal gates. Here, we show that in
the case of weakly coupled qubits, it is possible to find all pulses that
implement a target entangling gate. We do this by mapping quantum evolution
onto geometric space curves. We derive the minimal conditions these curves must
satisfy in order to guarantee a gate with a desired entangling power is
implemented. Pulse waveforms are extracted from the curvatures of these curves.
We illustrate our method by designing fast, CNOT-equivalent entangling gates
for silicon quantum dot spin qubits with fidelities exceeding 99%. We show that
fidelities can be further improved while maintaining low bandwidth requirements

be costly in practical cases. To this end, we focus on an
offline-training-online-adaptation setting, in which the agent first learns
from offline experiences collected in environments with different dynamics and
then performs online policy adaptation in environments with new dynamics. In
this paper, we propose Policy Adaptation with Decoupled Representations (PAnDR)
for fast policy adaptation. In offline training phase, the environment
representation and policy representation are learned through contrastive
learning and policy recovery, respectively. The representations are further
refined by mutual information optimization to make them more decoupled and
complete. With learned representations, a Policy-Dynamics Value Function (PDVF)

different combinations of policies and environments from offline experiences.
In online adaptation phase, with the environment context inferred from few
experiences collected in new environments, the policy is optimized by gradient
ascent with respect to the PDVF. Our experiments show that PAnDR outperforms
existing algorithms in several representative policy adaptation problems.

state-feedback controllers for solving the linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
problem of uncertain discrete-time systems with multiplicative noise. To
synthesize a tractable solution, the recently developed system level synthesis
(SLS) framework is leveraged. It is shown that SLS shifts the controller
synthesis task from the design of a robust controller to the design of the
entire set-valued closed-loop system responses. To this end, the closed-loop
system response is entirely characterized by probabilistic set-valued maps from
the additive noise to control actions and states. A bi-level convex
optimization over the achievable set-valued closed-loop responses is then
developed to optimize the expected value of the LQR cost against the worst-case
closed-loop system response. The solution to this robust optimization problem
may be too conservative since it aims at enforcing the design constraints for
all possible system realizations. To deal with this issue, the presented
optimization problem is next reformulated as a chance-constrained program (CCP)
in which the guarantees are not intended in a deterministic sense of
satisfaction against all possible closed-loop system responses, but are instead
intended in a probabilistic sense of satisfaction against all but a small
fraction of the system responses. To approximately solve the CCP without the
requirement of knowing the probabilistic description of the uncertainty in the
system matrices, the so-called scenario optimization approach is employed,
which provides probabilistic guarantees based on a finite number of system
realizations and results in a convex optimization program with moderate
computational complexity. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to
illustrate the theoretical findings.

enables to interpret how the dipole moments of the molecules are induced and
interlocked by the electric field and the dipole-dipole interaction during the

capabilities with the recent introduction of huge Language Models. Despite this
success, natural language problems that involve several compounded steps are
still practically unlearnable, even by the largest LMs. This complies with
experimental failures for end-to-end learning of composite problems that were
demonstrated in a variety of domains. An effective mitigation is to introduce
intermediate supervision for solving sub-tasks of the compounded problem.
Recently, several works have demonstrated high gains by taking a
straightforward approach for incorporating intermediate supervision in
compounded natural language problems: the sequence-to-sequence LM is fed with
an augmented input, in which the decomposed tasks' labels are simply
concatenated to the original input. In this paper, we prove a positive learning
result that motivates these recent efforts. We show that when concatenating
intermediate supervision to the input and training a sequence-to-sequence model
on this modified input, unlearnable composite problems can become learnable. We
show that this is true for any family of tasks which on the one hand, are
unlearnable, and on the other hand, can be decomposed into a polynomial number
of simple sub-tasks, each of which depends only on O(1) previous sub-task
results. Beyond motivating contemporary empirical efforts for incorporating
intermediate supervision in sequence-to-sequence language models, our positive
theoretical result is the first of its kind in the landscape of results on the
benefits of intermediate supervision for neural-network learning: Until now,
all theoretical results on the subject are negative, i.e., show cases where
learning is impossible without intermediate supervision, while our result is
positive, showing that learning is facilitated in the presence of intermediate
supervision.

computationally hard, and, thus, in practice heuristics such as local search

strategy, where one replaces a given BNSL solution by a better solution within
some pre-defined neighborhood as long as this is possible. We study
ordering-based local search, where a solution is described via a topological
ordering of the variables. We show that given such a topological ordering, one

field emitters, plasma processing uses free oxygen produced in the plasma to
break down the hydrocarbons on the surface of the cavity. The residuals of the
hydrocarbons in the form of water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are
re-moved from the cryomodule as part of the process gas flow. The initial focus
of the effort is processing C100 cavities by injecting RF power into the HOM
coupler ports. We will then start investigating processing of C50 cavities by
introducing RF into the fundamental power coupler. The plan is to start
processing cryomodules in the CEBAF tunnel in the mid-term future, with a goal
of improving the operational gradients and the energy mar-gin of the linacs.
This work will describe the systems and methods used at JLAB for processing
cavities using an argon oxygen gas mixture. Before and after plasma pro-cessing

universality class for p=2 and p>3, respectively, while for p=3 only
first-order transitions are possible. The results of Monte Carlo simulations
confirm these predictions. There is also a second transition line, which
separates two phases in which gauge fields are essentially ordered. Along this

various time ranges, we confirm that directly optimizing for a criterion at the

while other losses rely on the comparison of perceptual properties. But, is the
choice of the objective function that crucial, i.e., does it play an important

analyzing the impact of the loss function on the estimated colorization

suffer from a large number of ties, thereby leading to a significant loss of
information. To mitigate this issue, conferences have started to ask reviewers
to additionally provide a ranking of the papers they have reviewed. There are
however two key challenges. First, there is no standard procedure for using
this ranking information and Area Chairs may use it in different ways
(including simply ignoring them), thereby leading to arbitrariness in the
peer-review process. Second, there are no suitable interfaces for judicious use
of this data nor methods to incorporate it in existing workflows, thereby
leading to inefficiencies. We take a principled approach to integrate the
ranking information into the scores. The output of our method is an updated

approach addresses the two aforementioned challenges by: (i) ensuring that
rankings are incorporated into the updates scores in the same manner for all
papers, thereby mitigating arbitrariness, and (ii) allowing to seamlessly use
existing interfaces and workflows designed for scores. We empirically evaluate

spacetime before discussing the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism (a
Hamiltonian approach) of general relativity. Then we proceed to give a brief
but self-contained introduction to homogeneous (but not necessarily isotropic)
universes and discuss the associated Bianchi classification. We first study
their dynamics in the Lagrangian formulation, followed by the Hamiltonian
formulation to show the equivalence of both approaches. In order to get hold of
the ADM formalism, we present a variety of examples: (i) free \& massless
scalar field coupled to homogeneous (in particular, Bianchi IX) universe, (ii)
scalar field with a potential term coupled to Bianchi IX universe, (iii)
electromagnetic field coupled to gravity in general, and (iv) electromagnetic
field coupled to Bianchi IX universe. Through these examples, we also introduce
the associated important concepts \& the dynamics of the system in
consideration using the Hamiltonian approach. We have tried to be detailed and
self-contained in this work but we do expect as a prerequisite to have
familiarity with the basic concepts in general relativity up to the point of
deriving the FRWL cosmological solution from the Einstein field equations.

method. The assistance is based on two distinct phases, one facilitating

exploitation of surrogates are automatically balanced by performing a
probabilistic knockout tournament among different clusters of solutions. A
study of multiple well-known population-based optimization algorithms is
conducted with and without the proposed surrogate assistance on single- and
multi-objective optimization problems with a maximum solution evaluation budget

where the density is drastically low. Some of these features are quite well
known, whereas others, such as a secondary peak in the kinetic potential or a
second bump in the conditional potential, are less or not known at all. We
discuss these features building on the analytical model treated in J. Chem.
Theory Comput. 14, 4151 (2018). In particular, we provide an explanation for
the underlying mechanism which determines the appearance of both peaks in the
kinetic potential and elucidate why these peaks delineate the region over which
the plateau structure, due to the N - 1 potential, stretches. We assess the
validity of the Heitler-London Ansatz at large but finite internuclear
distance, showing that, if optimal orbitals are used, this model is an
excellent approximation to the exact wavefunction. Notably, we find that the
second natural orbital presents an extra node very far out on the side of the

  Neuroscience (COSYNE) 2022",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  An open problem in neuroscience is to explain the functional role of
oscillations in neural networks, contributing, for example, to perception,
attention, and memory. Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is associated with
information integration across populations of neurons. Impaired CFC is linked
to neurological disease. It is unclear what role CFC has in information
processing and brain functional connectivity. We construct a model of CFC which
predicts a computational role for observed $\theta - \gamma$ oscillatory
circuits in the hippocampus and cortex. Our model predicts that the complex
dynamics in recurrent and feedforward networks of coupled oscillators performs
robust information storage and pattern retrieval. Based on phasor associative
memories (PAM), we present a novel oscillator neural network (ONN) model that
includes subharmonic injection locking (SHIL) and which reproduces experimental
observations of CFC. We show that the presence of CFC increases the memory
capacity of a population of neurons connected by plastic synapses. CFC enables
error-free pattern retrieval whereas pattern retrieval fails without CFC. In
addition, the trade-offs between sparse connectivity, capacity, and information
per connection are identified. The associative memory is based on a
complex-valued neural network, or phasor neural network (PNN). We show that for
values of $Q$ which are the same as the ratio of $\gamma$ to $\theta$
oscillations observed in the hippocampus and the cortex, the associative memory
achieves greater capacity and information storage than previous models. The
novel contributions of this work are providing a computational framework based
on oscillator dynamics which predicts the functional role of neural
oscillations and connecting concepts in neural network theory and dynamical
system theory.

clustering perspective. Recently, state-of-the-art clustering performance in
various domains has been achieved by deep clustering methods. Especially, deep
graph clustering (DGC) methods have successfully extended deep clustering to
graph-structured data by learning node representations and cluster assignments
in a joint optimization framework. Despite some differences in modeling choices
(e.g., encoder architectures), existing DGC methods are mainly based on
autoencoders and use the same clustering objective with relatively minor
adaptations. Also, while many real-world graphs are dynamic, previous DGC
methods considered only static graphs. In this work, we develop CGC, a novel
end-to-end framework for graph clustering, which fundamentally differs from
existing methods. CGC learns node embeddings and cluster assignments in a
contrastive graph learning framework, where positive and negative samples are
carefully selected in a multi-level scheme such that they reflect hierarchical
community structures and network homophily. Also, we extend CGC for
time-evolving data, where temporal graph clustering is performed in an
incremental learning fashion, with the ability to detect change points.
Extensive evaluation on real-world graphs demonstrates that the proposed CGC
consistently outperforms existing methods.

a contributor to collective creativity. We show that gender diversity requires
inclusion to lead to benefits in creativity by analyzing teams in 4011 video
game projects. Recording data on the weighted network from past collaborations,
we developed four measures of inclusion, depending on a lack of segregation,
strong ties across genders, and the incorporation of women into the core of the
team s network. We found that gender diversity without inclusion does not
contribute to creativity, while with maximal inclusion one standard deviation
change in diversity results in .04 to .09 standard deviation change in
creativity, depending on the measure of inclusion. To reap creative benefits of
diversity, developer firms need to include 23 percent or more female developers
(as opposed to the 15 percent mean female proportion) and include them in the
team along all dimensions. Inclusion at low diversity has a negative effect. By
analyzing the sequences of diversity and inclusion across games within firms,
we found that adding diversity first, and developing inclusion later can lead
to higher diversity and inclusion, compared to adding female developers with
already existing cross-gender ties to the team.

cannot be interchanged with the others, i.e., Ruby and Java code possess very
different structure. To better understand how monolingual and multilingual PLMs

  Entity Recognition","Accepted at ICPC 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Code comment generation is the task of generating a high-level natural
language description for a given code method or function. Although researchers
have been studying multiple ways to generate code comments automatically,
previous work mainly considers representing a code token in its entirety
semantics form only (e.g., a language model is used to learn the semantics of a
code token), and additional code properties such as the tree structure of a
code are included as an auxiliary input to the model. There are two
limitations: 1) Learning the code token in its entirety form may not be able to
capture information succinctly in source code, and 2) The code token does not
contain additional syntactic information, inherently important in programming
languages.
  In this paper, we present LAnguage Model and Named Entity Recognition
(LAMNER), a code comment generator capable of encoding code constructs
effectively and capturing the structural property of a code token. A
character-level language model is used to learn the semantic representation to
encode a code token. For the structural property of a token, a Named Entity
Recognition model is trained to learn the different types of code tokens. These
representations are then fed into an encoder-decoder architecture to generate
code comments. We evaluate the generated comments from LAMNER and other
baselines on a popular Java dataset with four commonly used metrics. Our
results show that LAMNER is effective and improves over the best baseline model
in BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and CIDEr by 14.34%,
18.98%, 21.55%, 23.00%, 10.52%, 1.44%, and 25.86%, respectively. Additionally,
we fused LAMNER's code representation with the baseline models, and the fused
models consistently showed improvement over the non-fused models. The human
evaluation further shows that LAMNER produces high-quality code comments.

based on the Transformer architecture or use transformer-based Pre-trained
Language Models (PLM) trained on code. Although these models achieve the state
of the arts results in many downstream tasks such as code summarization and bug
detection, they are based on Transformer and PLM, which are mainly studied in
the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. The current studies rely on the
reasoning and practices from NLP for these models in code, despite the
differences between natural languages and programming languages. There is also
limited literature on explaining how code is modeled.
  Here, we investigate the attention behavior of PLM on code and compare it
with natural language. We pre-trained BERT, a Transformer based PLM, on code
and explored what kind of information it learns, both semantic and syntactic.
We run several experiments to analyze the attention values of code constructs
on each other and what BERT learns in each layer. Our analyses show that BERT
pays more attention to syntactic entities, specifically identifiers and
separators, in contrast to the most attended token [CLS] in NLP. This
observation motivated us to leverage identifiers to represent the code sequence
instead of the [CLS] token when used for code clone detection. Our results show
that employing embeddings from identifiers increases the performance of BERT by
605% and 4% F1-score in its lower layers and the upper layers, respectively.
When identifiers' embeddings are used in CodeBERT, a code-based PLM, the
performance is improved by 21-24% in the F1-score of clone detection. The
findings can benefit the research community by using code-specific
representations instead of applying the common embeddings used in NLP, and open
new directions for developing smaller models with similar performance.

earthquake-susceptible structures. In the last decades, several researchers
have proposed such procedures, some of which were adopted by seismic code

of the computers' power has led to the development of modern statistical
methods based on the adoption of Machine Learning algorithms. These methods
have been shown to be useful for predicting seismic performance and classifying
structural damage level by means of extracting patterns from data collected via
various sources. A large training dataset is used for the implementation of the
classification algorithms. To this end, 90 3D R/C buildings with three
different masonry infills' distributions are analysed utilizing Nonlinear Time
