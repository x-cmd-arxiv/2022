However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation
setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal
processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally
adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses
some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming
convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified
training and can impact the resulting audio quality.
  In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal
streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with
real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training
reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models
trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our
method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To
evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides
high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music
and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while
having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two
open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and
as a VST audio plugin. This allows to endow traditional digital audio
workstation with real-time neural audio synthesis on a laptop CPU.

with a 2-coordinate descent scheme. At every iteration, the algorithm chooses
between two different strategies: the first one requires to compute the whole
gradient of the smooth term of the objective function and is more accurate in

set number of children with the same initial weights are spawned. Each child
undergoes a training step and adjusts their weights on the same data. Due to
stochastic back-propagation, the set of children has a variety of weights with
different levels of performance. The weights that best minimize the
reconstruction loss with a given signal dictionary are passed to the next
generation. The predictions from the best-performing weights of the first and
last generation are compared. We found improvements while comparing the weights
of these two generations. However, due to several confounding parameters and
hyperparameter limitations, some of the weights had negligible improvements. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use sparse coding in
this way to optimize time series forecasting model weights, such as those of an

we propose as an alternative a Deep Generative Model. This model is trained on
the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation and is capable of sampling the orientations of
a population of galaxies so as to recover the correct alignments. In our

The generative model is implemented on a Generative Adversarial Network

explore exotic quantum many-body physics. Here we propose a novel scheme with
laser-assisted dipole-dipole interactions to realize synthetic magnetic field
for Rydberg atoms in a two-dimensional array configuration, which gives rise to
the exotic bosonic topological states. In the presence of an external effective
Zeeman splitting gradient, the dipole-dipole interaction between neighboring
Rydberg atoms along the gradient direction is suppressed, but can be assisted
when Raman lights are applied to compensate the energy difference. With this
scheme we generate a controllable uniform magnetic field for the complex
spin-exchange coupling model, which can be mapped to hard core bosons coupling
to an external synthetic magnetic field. The highly tunable flat Chern bands of
the hard core bosons are then obtained and moreover, the bosonic fractional
quantum Hall states can be achieved with experimental feasibility. This work
opens an avenue for the realization of the highly-sought-after bosonic
topological orders using Rydberg atoms.

a product of destructive interference to produce a prescription for generating

test of the technique, we use it to combine four THz laser fields generated by
periodically poled Lithium Niobate. From this, we are able to predict and
observe for the first time THz optical superoscillations in the temporal

analytic arcs as well as the associated norming constants. For the reflection
coefficient as well as the eigenvalues near 0 in the spectral plane, we employ
instead an older theory that has been developed in great detail by Olver. Our

and luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) taken from the SUNBIRD survey. The
targets were imaged using near-infrared (NIR) K-band adaptive optics systems.
Single power-law fits of the derived CLFs result in a slope ranging between
1.53 and 2.41, with the median and average of 1.87 +/- 0.23 and 1.93 +/- 0.23,
respectively. Possible biases such as blending effects and the choice of
binning should only flatten the slope by no more than ~0.15, especially for
cases where the luminosity distance of the host galaxy is below 100 Mpc.
Results from this follow-up study strengthen the conclusion from our previous
work: the CLF slopes are shallower for strongly star-forming galaxies in
comparison to those with less intense star formation activity. There is also a
(mild) correlation between the slope and both the host galaxy's star formation
rate (SFR) and SFR density Sigma_SFR, i.e. the CLF flattens with an increasing
SFR and Sigma_SFR. Finally, we also find that CLFs on sub-galactic scales
associated with the nuclear regions of cluster-rich targets (N ~ 300) have
typically shallower slopes than the ones of the outer field by ~0.5. Our
analyses suggest that the extreme environments of strongly star-forming
galaxies are likely to influence the cluster formation mechanisms and
ultimately their physical properties.

introduces a novel concept for generating high-Q quasi-BICs, which strongly
relaxes this requirement by incorporating a relatively large perturbative
element close to high-symmetry points of an undistorted BIC metasurface, acting
as a coupler to the radiation continuum. We validate this approach by adding a
$\sim$100 nm diameter cylinder between two reflection-symmetry points separated
by a 300 nm gap in an elliptical disk metasurface unit cell, using gallium
phosphide as the dielectric. We find that high-Q resonances emerge when the
cylindrical coupler is placed at any position between such symmetry points. We
further explore this metasurface's second harmonic generation capability in the
optical range. Displacing the coupler as much as a full diameter from a BIC
condition produces record-breaking normalized conversion efficiencies >10$^{2}$
W$^{-1}$. The strategy of enclosing a disruptive element between multiple
high-symmetry points in a BIC metasurface could be applied to construct robust
high-Q quasi-BICs in many geometrical designs.

$\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}$, $\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}$) and Hubble constant
($h_{0}$) are useful for fundamental understanding of the universe from many
perspectives. In this article, we propose a new procedure to estimate these
parameters for $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe in the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background. We generalize the two-point
statistic first proposed by Sahni et al. (2008) to the three point case and
estimate the parameters using currently available Hubble parameter ($H(z)$)
values in the redshift range $0.07 \leq z \leq 2.36$ measured by differential
age (DA) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) techniques. All the parameters
are estimated assuming the general case of non-flat universe. Using both DA and
BAO data we obtain $\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}=0.1485^{+0.0041}_{-0.0051}$,
$\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}=-0.0137^{+0.0129}_{-0.0125}$,

$h_{0}=0.6689^{+0.0141}_{-0.0121}$. These results are in satisfactory agreement
with the Planck results. An important advantage of our method is that to
estimate value of any one of the independent cosmological parameters one does
not need to use values for rest of them. Each parameter is obtained solely from
the measured values of Hubble parameters at different redshifts without any
need to use values of other parameters. Such a method is expected to be less
susceptible to the undesired effects of degeneracy issues between cosmological
parameters during their estimations. Moreover, there is no requirement of

internal multiples, related to the over- and underburden, can obstruct the view
of the target response, hence complicating the time-lapse analysis. In order to
retrieve a response that is free from over- and underburden effects, the
data-driven Marchenko method is used. This method effectively isolates the
target response, which can then be used to extract more precise time-lapse
changes. Additionally, the method also reveals target-related multiples that
probe the reservoir more than once, which further define the changes in the
reservoir. To verify the effectiveness of the method, a numerical example is
constructed. This test shows that when using the isolated target response, the
observed time differences resemble the expected time differences in the

  with an Application to the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Longitudinal studies are subject to nonresponse when individuals fail to
provide data for entire waves or particular questions of the survey. We compare
approaches to nonresponse bias analysis (NRBA) in longitudinal studies and
illustrate them on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class
of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011). Wave nonresponse with attrition often yields a
monotone missingness pattern, and the missingness mechanism can be missing at
random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). We discuss weighting, multiple
imputation (MI), incomplete data modeling, and Bayesian approaches to NRBA for
monotone patterns. Weighting adjustments are effective when the constructed
weights are correlated to the survey outcome of interest. MI allows for
variables with missing values to be included in the imputation model, yielding
potentially less biased and more efficient estimates. Multilevel models with
maximum likelihood estimation and marginal models estimated using generalized
estimating equations can also handle incomplete longitudinal data. Bayesian
methods introduce prior information and potentially stabilize model estimation.
We add offsets in the MAR results to provide sensitivity analyses to assess
MNAR deviations. We conduct NRBA for descriptive summaries and analytic model
estimates and find that in the ECLS-K:2011 application, NRBA yields minor
changes to the substantive conclusions. The strength of evidence about our NRBA
depends on the strength of the relationship between the characteristics in the
nonresponse adjustment and the key survey outcomes, so the key to a successful
NRBA is to include strong predictors.

The symmetry enriched topological order present has a non-trivial realization
of square-lattice translation (and rotation/reflection) symmetry, where anyons
on different lattice sites have different types and belong to different
superselection sectors. We call such particles ""position-dependent
excitations."" As a result, in the rank-2 toric code anyons can hop by one
lattice site in some directions while only by $N$ lattice sites in others,
reminiscent of fracton topological order in ${3+1}$d. We find that while there
are $N^2$ flavors of $e$ charges and $2N$ flavors of $m$ fluxes, there are not
$N^{N^{2} + 2N}$ anyon types. Instead, there are $N^{6}$ anyon types, and we
can use Chern-Simons theory with six $U(1)$ gauge fields to describe all of
them. While the lattice translations permute anyon types, we find that such
permutations cannot be expressed as transformations on the six $U(1)$ gauge
fields. Thus the realization of translation symmetry in the $U^6(1)$
Chern-Simons theory is not known. Despite this, we find a way to calculate the
translation-dependent properties of the theory. In particular, we find that the
ground state degeneracy on an ${L_{x}\times L_{y}}$ torus is
${N^{3}\gcd(L_{x},N) \gcd(L_{y},N) \gcd(L_{x},L_{y},N)}$, where $\gcd$ stands

super-resolution methods adopt the optical flow or deformable convolution for
explicitly motion compensation. However, such temporal modeling techniques
increase the model complexity and might fail in case of occlusion or complex
motion, resulting in serious distortion and artifacts. In this paper, we
propose to explore the role of explicit temporal difference modeling in both LR
and HR space. Instead of directly feeding consecutive frames into a VSR model,
we propose to compute the temporal difference between frames and divide those
pixels into two subsets according to the level of difference. They are
separately processed with two branches of different receptive fields in order
to better extract complementary information. To further enhance the
super-resolution result, not only spatial residual features are extracted, but
the difference between consecutive frames in high-frequency domain is also
computed. It allows the model to exploit intermediate SR results in both future
and past to refine the current SR output. The difference at different time
steps could be cached such that information from further distance in time could
be propagated to the current frame for refinement. Experiments on several video
super-resolution benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method and its favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.

for better decision making. Thus, the performance for OLAP is crucial; however,
it is costly to support OLAP for a large data-set. An approximate query process
(AQP) was proposed to efficiently compute approximate values as close as to the
exact answer. Existing AQP techniques can be categorized into two parts, online
aggregation, and offline synopsis generation, each having its limitations and
challenges. Online aggregation-based AQP progressively generates approximate
results with some error estimates (i.e., confidence interval) until the
processing of all data is done. In Offline synopsis generation-based AQP,
synopses are generated offline using a-priori knowledge such as query workload
or data statistics. Later, OLAP queries are answered using these synopses. This
paper focuses on surveying only the online aggregation-based AQP. For this
purpose, firstly, we discuss the research challenges in online
aggregation-based AQP and summarize existing approaches to address these
challenges. In addition, we also discuss the advantages and limitations of
existing online aggregation mechanisms. Lastly, we discuss some research
challenges and opportunities for further advancing online aggregation research.
Our goal is for people to understand the current progress in the online
aggregation-based AQP area and find new insights into it.

Project page: https://jianglongye.com/gifs",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent development of neural implicit function has shown tremendous success
on high-quality 3D shape reconstruction. However, most works divide the space

single-layer and watertight shapes. This limitation leads to tedious data
processing (converting non-watertight raw data to watertight) as well as the
incapability of representing general object shapes in the real world. In this
work, we propose a novel method to represent general shapes including
non-watertight shapes and shapes with multi-layer surfaces. We introduce
General Implicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS), which models the relationships
between every two points instead of the relationships between points and
surfaces. Instead of dividing 3D space into predefined inside-outside regions,
GIFS encodes whether two points are separated by any surface. Experiments on
ShapeNet show that GIFS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms
of reconstruction quality, rendering efficiency, and visual fidelity. Project

systematic framework in the Multimedia Quality Assessment field for comparing
subjective experiments in terms of their precision. Therefore, the main idea of
this paper is to propose a framework for comparing subjective experiments in
the field of MQA based on appropriate experiment precision measures. We present
three experiment precision measures and three related experiment precision
comparison methods. We systematically analyse the performance of the measures
and methods proposed. We do so both through a simulation study (varying user
rating variance and bias) and by using data from four real-world Quality of
Experience (QoE) subjective experiments. In the simulation study we focus on
crowdsourcing QoE experiments, since they are known to generate ratings with
higher variance and bias, when compared to traditional subjective experiment
methodologies. We conclude that our proposed measures and related comparison
methods properly capture experiment precision (both when tested on simulated
and real-world data). One of the measures also proves capable of dealing with
even significantly biased responses. We believe our experiment precision
assessment framework will help compare different subjective experiment
methodologies. For example, it may help decide which methodology results in
more precise user ratings. This may potentially inform future standardisation
activities.

relationships through the optimal choice between a low interest rate or a high
liquidity supply. The latter, based on the agents' balance sheet, allows
determining the liquidity supply and interest rate that the banks optimally

systems use a model-based approach to enable natural conversations. To provide
supervision signal required to train such models, ideas such as human
annotation, replication of a rule-based system, relabeling based on user
paraphrases, and bandit-based learning were suggested. However, these
approaches: (a) do not scale in terms of the number of skills and skill
on-boarding, (b) require a very costly expert annotation/rule-design, (c)
introduce risks in the user experience with each model update. In this paper,
we present a scalable self-learning approach to explore routing alternatives
without causing abrupt policy changes that break the user experience, learn
from the user interaction, and incrementally improve the routing via frequent
model refreshes. To enable such robust frequent model updates, we suggest a
simple and effective approach that ensures controlled policy updates for
individual domains, followed by an off-policy evaluation for making deployment
decisions without any need for lengthy A/B experimentation. We conduct various
offline and online A/B experiments on a commercial large-scale conversational
system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world

  Robotic Gripper","2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To adapt to constantly changing environments and be safe for human
interaction, robots should have compliant and soft characteristics as well as
the ability to sense the world around them. Even so, the incorporation of
tactile sensing into a soft compliant robot, like the Fin Ray finger, is
difficult due to its deformable structure. Not only does the frame need to be
modified to allow room for a vision sensor, which enables intricate tactile
sensing, the robot must also retain its original mechanically compliant
properties. However, adding high-resolution tactile sensors to soft fingers is
difficult since many sensorized fingers, such as GelSight-based ones, are rigid
and function under the assumption that changes in the sensing region are only
from tactile contact and not from finger compliance. A sensorized soft robotic
finger needs to be able to separate its overall proprioceptive changes from its
tactile information. To this end, this paper introduces the novel design of a
GelSight Fin Ray, which embodies both the ability to passively adapt to any
object it grasps and the ability to perform high-resolution tactile
reconstruction, object orientation estimation, and marker tracking for shear
and torsional forces. Having these capabilities allow soft and compliant robots
to perform more manipulation tasks that require sensing. One such task the
finger is able to perform successfully is a kitchen task: wine glass
reorientation and placement, which is difficult to do with external vision
sensors but is easy with tactile sensing. The development of this sensing
technology could also potentially be applied to other soft compliant grippers,
increasing their viability in many different fields.

end result is an intuitive design paradigm that allows the creation of new
virtual designs of manipulators in a matter of minutes. Our framework allows
the designer to fine-tune the manipulator's shape through cage-based geometry
deformation. Finally, the designer can select surfaces for adding tactile
sensing. Once the manipulator design is finished, the program will
automatically generate 3D printing and knitting files for manufacturing. We

information from both visual feature and articulation-aware coordinates to
process a query point. We perform experiments across three datasets and show
that our method consistently outperforms baselines and is able to reconstruct a

from huge number of parameters, restricting their applicability on devices with
limited memory. To alleviate this problem, we propose MiniViT, a new
compression framework, which achieves parameter reduction in vision
transformers while retaining the same performance. The central idea of MiniViT
is to multiplex the weights of consecutive transformer blocks. More
specifically, we make the weights shared across layers, while imposing a
transformation on the weights to increase diversity. Weight distillation over
self-attention is also applied to transfer knowledge from large-scale ViT
models to weight-multiplexed compact models. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of MiniViT, showing that it can reduce the size of the
pre-trained Swin-B transformer by 48\%, while achieving an increase of 1.0\% in
Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Moreover, using a single-layer of parameters,
MiniViT is able to compress DeiT-B by 9.7 times from 86M to 9M parameters,
without seriously compromising the performance. Finally, we verify the
transferability of MiniViT by reporting its performance on downstream
benchmarks. Code and models are available at here.

copies of a mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$, and $\varepsilon >
0$, and we are asked to determine whether $\rho = \sigma$ or whether $\| \rho -
\sigma \|_1 > \varepsilon$. When $\sigma$ is the maximally mixed state
$\frac{1}{d} I_d$, this is known as mixedness testing. We focus on algorithms
which use incoherent measurements, i.e. which only measure one copy of $\rho$
at a time. Unlike those that use entangled, multi-copy measurements, these can
be implemented without persistent quantum memory and thus represent a large
class of protocols that can be run on current or near-term devices.
  For mixedness testing, there is a folklore algorithm which uses incoherent
measurements and only needs $O(d^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ copies. The algorithm
is non-adaptive, that is, its measurements are fixed ahead of time, and is
known to be optimal for non-adaptive algorithms. However, when the algorithm
can make arbitrary incoherent measurements, the best known lower bound is only
$\Omega (d^{4/3} / \varepsilon^2)$ [Bubeck-Chen-Li '20], and it has been an
outstanding open problem to close this polynomial gap. In this work, 1) we
settle the copy complexity of mixedness testing with incoherent measurements

we show the instance-optimal bounds for state certification to general $\sigma$
first derived by [Chen-Li-O'Donnell '21] for non-adaptive measurements also
hold for arbitrary incoherent measurements.
  Qualitatively, our results say that adaptivity does not help at all for these
problems. Our results are based on new techniques that allow us to reduce the

conditioning the generator on a target scale allows us to generate higher

Second, by conditioning on continuous coordinates, we can sample patches that
still obey a consistent global layout, which also allows for scalable training
at higher resolutions. Controlled FFHQ experiments show that our method can
take advantage of multi-resolution training data better than discrete
multi-scale approaches, achieving better FID scores and cleaner high-frequency

modern program synthesis to generate the machine-dependent parts of an
operating system. Our ultimate goal is to generate new ports automatically from
descriptions of new machines. One of the issues involved is writing
specifications, both for machine-dependent operating system functionality and
for instruction set architectures. We designed two domain-specific languages:
Alewife for machine-independent specifications of machine-dependent operating
system functionality and Cassiopea for describing instruction set architecture
semantics. Automated porting also requires an implementation. We developed a
toolchain that, given an Alewife specification and a Cassiopea machine
description, specializes the machine-independent specification to the target
instruction set architecture and synthesizes an implementation in assembly
language with a customized symbolic execution engine. Using this approach, we
demonstrate successful synthesis of a total of 140 OS components from two
pre-existing OSes for four real hardware platforms. We also developed several
optimization methods for OS-related assembly synthesis to improve scalability.
The effectiveness of our languages and ability to synthesize code for all 140

rate on host cluster properties. We find that tidal disruption events occur
most frequently in core-collapsed globular clusters and that roughly $25\%$ of
the disrupted stars are merger products (i.e., blue straggler stars). Using
hydrodynamic simulations, we model the tidal disruptions themselves (over
timescales of days) to determine the mass bound to the neutron star and the
properties of the accretion disks formed. In general, we find that roughly
$80-90\%$ of the initial stellar mass becomes bound to the neutron star
following disruption. Additionally, we find that neutron stars receive
impulsive kicks of up to about $20\,$km/s as a result of the asymmetry of
unbound ejecta; these kicks place these neutron stars on elongated orbits
within their host cluster, with apocenter distances well outside the cluster
core. Finally, we model the evolution of the (hypercritical) accretion disks on
longer timescales (days to years after disruption) to estimate the accretion
rate onto the neutron stars and accompanying spin-up. As long as $\gtrsim1\%$

construct flexible high-dimensional densities. This formulation directly
contradicts the manifold hypothesis, which states that observed data lies on a
low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. In this
paper we investigate the pathologies of maximum-likelihood training in the
presence of this dimensionality mismatch. We formally prove that degenerate
optima are achieved wherein the manifold itself is learned but not the
distribution on it, a phenomenon we call manifold overfitting. We propose a
class of two-step procedures consisting of a dimensionality reduction step
followed by maximum-likelihood density estimation, and prove that they recover
the data-generating distribution in the nonparametric regime, thus avoiding
manifold overfitting. We also show that these procedures enable density
estimation on the manifolds learned by implicit models, such as generative
adversarial networks, hence addressing a major shortcoming of these models.
Several recently proposed methods are instances of our two-step procedures; we
thus unify, extend, and theoretically justify a large class of models.

interpreting the orbits of its constituent galaxies and placing the LG in a
cosmological context. One of the few methods that allows inferring the total
mass directly is the ""Timing Argument,"" which models the relative orbit of the
Milky Way (MW) and M31 in equilibrium. The MW itself is not in equilibrium, a
byproduct of its merger history including the recent pericentric passage of the
LMC, and recent work has found that the MW disk is moving with a lower bound
""travel velocity"" of $\sim 32~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ with respect to the outer
stellar halo. Previous Timing Argument measurements attempt to account for this
non-equilibrium state, but have been restricted to theoretical predictions for
the impact of the LMC specifically. In this paper, we quantify the impact of a
travel velocity on recovered LG mass estimates using several different
compilations of recent kinematic measurements of M31. We find that
incorporating the measured value of the travel velocity lowers the inferred LG
mass by 10--12\% compared to a static MW halo. Measurements of the travel
velocity with more distant tracers could yield even larger values, which would
further decrease the inferred LG mass. Therefore, the newly measured travel
velocity directly implies a lower LG mass than from a model with a static MW
halo and must be considered in future dynamical studies of the Local Volume.

  Curve using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) is the most fundamental
relationship in unsaturated soil mechanics, relating the amount of water in the
soil to the corresponding matric suction. From experimental evidence, it is
known that SWCC exhibits hysteresis (i.e. wetting/drying path dependence).
Various factors have been proposed as contributors to SWCC hysteresis,
including air entrapment, contact angle hysteresis, ink-bottle effect, and
change of soil fabric due to swelling and shrinkage, however, the significance
of their contribution is debated. From our pore-scale numerical simulations,
using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method, we see that even when
controlling for all these factors SWCC hysteresis still occurs, indicating that
there is some underlying source that is not accounted for in these factors. We
find this underlying source by comparing the liquid/gas phase distributions for
simulated wetting and drying experiments of 2D and 3D granular packings. We see
that during wetting (i.e. pore filling) many liquid bridges expand
simultaneously and join together to fill the pores from the smallest to the
largest, allowing menisci with larger radii of curvature (lower matric
suction). Whereas, during drying (i.e. pore emptying), only the limited
existing gas clusters can expand, which become constrained by the size of the
pore openings surrounding them and result in menisci with smaller radii of
curvature (higher matric suction).

  optimization",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms have become fairly popular for
many-objective optimization in recent years. However, the existing
decomposition methods still are quite sensitive to the various shapes of
frontiers of many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). On the one hand, the
cone decomposition methods such as the penalty-based boundary intersection
(PBI) are incapable of acquiring uniform frontiers for MaOPs with very convex
frontiers. On the other hand, the parallel reference lines of the parallel
decomposition methods including the normal boundary intersection (NBI) might
result in poor diversity because of under-sampling near the boundaries for
MaOPs with concave frontiers. In this paper, a collaborative decomposition
method is first proposed to integrate the advantages of parallel decomposition
and cone decomposition to overcome their respective disadvantages. This method
inherits the NBI-style Tchebycheff function as a convergence measure to
heighten the convergence and uniformity of distribution of the PBI method.
Moreover, this method also adaptively tunes the extent of rotating an NBI
reference line towards a PBI reference line for every subproblem to enhance the
diversity of distribution of the NBI method. Furthermore, a collaborative
decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm (CoDEA) is presented for
many-objective optimization. A collaborative decomposition-based environmental
selection mechanism is primarily designed in CoDEA to rank all the individuals
associated with the same PBI reference line in the boundary layer and pick out
the best ranks. CoDEA is compared with several popular algorithms on 85
benchmark test instances. The experimental results show that CoDEA achieves
high competitiveness benefiting from the collaborative decomposition
maintaining a good balance among the convergence, uniformity, and diversity of
distribution.

with the translation equivariance of convolutional neural networks being a
canonical example. Equivariances can be embedded in architectures through
weight-sharing and place symmetry constraints on the functions a neural network
can represent. The type of symmetry is typically fixed and has to be chosen in
advance. Although some tasks are inherently equivariant, many tasks do not
strictly follow such symmetries. In such cases, equivariance constraints can be
overly restrictive. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient relaxation
of equivariance that can effectively interpolate between a (i) non-equivariant
linear product, (ii) a strict-equivariant convolution, and (iii) a
strictly-invariant mapping. The proposed parameterisation can be thought of as
a building block to allow adjustable symmetry structure in neural networks. In
addition, we demonstrate that the amount of equivariance can be learned from
the training data using backpropagation. Gradient-based learning of
equivariance achieves similar or improved performance compared to the best
value found by cross-validation and outperforms baselines with partial or
strict equivariance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification tasks.

the gradient-informed, one-operator-at-a-time circuit construction seems to
accomplish two things: First, it provides an initialization strategy that is
dramatically better than random initialization, and which is applicable in
situations where chemical intuition cannot help with initialization, i.e., when
Hartree-Fock is a poor approximation to the ground state. Second, even if an
ADAPT-VQE iteration converges to a local trap at one step, it can still
""burrow"" toward the exact solution by adding more operators, which
preferentially deepens the occupied trap. This same mechanism helps highlight a
surprising feature of ADAPT-VQE: It should not suffer optimization problems due
to ""barren plateaus"". Even if barren plateaus appear in the parameter
landscape, our analysis and simulations reveal that ADAPT-VQE avoids such
regions by design.

generally trained in a fully-supervised fashion, which requires large amounts
of costly training labels, and does not generalize well to classes unseen

human interactions. Existing methods rely on user feedback in the 2D image
domain. As a consequence, users are required to constantly switch between 2D

multiple input modalities. Therefore, integration with existing standard 3D

from any target domain, and can adapt to new environments where no appropriate
training sets are available. Our system continuously adjusts the object
segmentation based on the user feedback and achieves accurate dense 3D

its potential for efficient labeling of large-scale and varied 3D datasets, our

the world to predict the future states of both the environment and the

argue that it is beneficial to model the state of the ego-vehicle, which often
has simple, predictable and deterministic behavior, separately from the rest of
the environment, which is much more complex and highly multimodal. We propose
to model the ego-vehicle using a simple and differentiable kinematic model,
while training a stochastic convolutional forward model on raster

evaluate their performance both with Model Predictive Control (MPC) and direct

works introduced a binding model based on quadratic functions of bound pairs,
followed by vector summation of multiple pairs. Based on this framework, we
address following questions: Which classes of quadratic matrices are optimal
for decoding relational structures? And what is the resultant accuracy? We
introduce a new class of binding matrices based on a matrix representation of
octonion algebra, an eight-dimensional extension of complex numbers. We show
that these matrices enable a more accurate unbinding than previously known
methods when a small number of pairs are present. Moreover, numerical
optimization of a binding operator converges to this octonion binding. We also
show that when there are a large number of bound pairs, however, a random
quadratic binding performs as well as the octonion and previously-proposed
binding methods. This study thus provides new insight into potential neural
mechanisms of binding operations in the brain.

Marginal models are useful when interest lies in quantifying associations
averaged across a population of clusters. When the functional form of a
covariate-outcome association is unknown, flexible regression methods are
needed to allow for potentially non-linear relationships. We propose a novel
marginal additive model (MAM) for modelling cluster-correlated data with
non-linear population-averaged associations. The proposed MAM is a unified
framework for estimation and uncertainty quantification of a marginal mean
model, combined with inference for between-cluster variability and
cluster-specific prediction. We propose a fitting algorithm that enables
efficient computation of standard errors and corrects for estimation of penalty
terms. We demonstrate the proposed methods in simulations and in application to
(i) a longitudinal study of beaver foraging behaviour, and (ii) a spatial
analysis of Loaloa infection in West Africa. R code for implementing the
proposed methodology is available at https://github.com/awstringer1/mam.

learning algorithms when assumptions on the distribution of examples can be
made, such as Gaussianity or uniformity over the domain. But how can one be
confident that data indeed satisfies such assumption, so that one can trust in
output quality of the agnostic learning algorithm? We propose a model by which
to systematically study the design of tester-learner pairs
$(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{T})$, such that if the distribution on examples in the
data passes the tester $\mathcal{T}$ then one can safely trust the output of
the agnostic learner $\mathcal{A}$ on the data.
  To demonstrate the power of the model, we apply it to the classical problem
of agnostically learning halfspaces under the standard Gaussian distribution
and present a tester-learner pair with combined run-time of
$n^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)}$. This qualitatively matches that of the best
known ordinary agnostic learning algorithms for this task. In contrast, finite
sample Gaussianity testers do not exist for the $L_1$ and EMD distance
measures. A key step is to show that half-spaces are well-approximated with
low-degree polynomials relative to distributions with low-degree moments close
to those of a Gaussian.
  We also go beyond spherically-symmetric distributions, and give a
tester-learner pair for halfspaces under the uniform distribution on
$\{0,1\}^n$ with combined run-time of $n^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)}$. This is
achieved using polynomial approximation theory and critical index machinery.
  We also show there exist some well-studied settings where
$2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$ run-time agnostic learning algorithms are available,
yet the combined run-times of tester-learner pairs must be as high as
$2^{\Omega(n)}$. On that account, the design of tester-learner pairs is a
research direction in its own right independent of standard agnostic learning.

significantly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in radio frequency (RF) and

completely disrupt data transmission in free-space optical (FSO) systems.
Therefore, the skip-zone dilemma must be resolved to ensure the efficient

widely accepted as a method of mitigating skip-zones and providing

verification. Here we present moderate-resolution spectra of both stars,
confirming them as low-gravity objects that are extremely likely to be cluster
members. Through comparison with a library of synthetic spectra, we made
approximate estimates of the stars' atmospheric parameters. We find that the
yPAGB star ZNG 4 has an effective temperature of Teff ~ 6500 K, a surface
gravity of log g ~ 1, and a metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.5, similar to that of
the host cluster. The blue PAGB star ZNG 2 has Teff ~ 18000 K, log g ~ 3, and
an apparently low metallicity in the range of [Fe/H] ~ -2.0 to -2.5. Both stars
are bright (V=12.5 and 13.3, respectively). We urge high-dispersion
spectroscopic follow-up to determine detailed atmospheric parameters and
chemical compositions, and to monitor radial velocities.

  Decomposition",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  CP decomposition (CPD) is prevalent in chemometrics, signal processing, data
mining and many more fields. While many algorithms have been proposed to
compute the CPD, alternating least squares (ALS) remains one of the most widely
used algorithm for computing the decomposition. Recent works have introduced
the notion of eigenvalues and singular values of a tensor and explored
applications of eigenvectors and singular vectors in areas like signal
processing, data analytics and in various other fields. We introduce a new
formulation for deriving singular values and vectors of a tensor by considering
the critical points of a function different from what is used in the previous
work. Computing these critical points in an alternating manner motivates an
alternating optimization algorithm which corresponds to alternating least
squares algorithm in the matrix case. However, for tensors with order greater
than equal to $3$, it minimizes an objective function which is different from
the commonly used least squares loss. Alternating optimization of this new
objective leads to simple updates to the factor matrices with the same
asymptotic computational cost as ALS. We show that a subsweep of this algorithm
can achieve a superlinear convergence rate for exact CPD with known rank and
verify it experimentally. We then view the algorithm as optimizing a
Mahalanobis distance with respect to each factor with ground metric dependent
on the other factors. This perspective allows us to generalize our approach to
interpolate between updates corresponding to the ALS and the new algorithm to
manage the tradeoff between stability and fitness of the decomposition. Our
experimental results show that for approximating synthetic and real-world
tensors, this algorithm and its variants converge to a better conditioned
decomposition with comparable and sometimes better fitness as compared to the
ALS algorithm.

compose them using choreography or orchestration. In choreography, every
service works independently, whereas, in orchestration, there is a controller
that coordinates service interactions. This paper makes a case for
orchestration. The promise of microservices is that each microservice can be
independently developed, deployed, tested, upgraded, and scaled. This makes
them suitable for systems running on cloud infrastructures. However,
microservice-based systems become complicated due to the complex interactions
of various services, concurrent events, failing components, developers' lack of
global view, and configurations of the environment. This makes maintaining and
debugging such systems very challenging. We hypothesize that orchestrated
services are easier to debug and to test this we ported the largest publicly
available microservices' benchmark TrainTicket, which is implemented using
choreography, to a fault-oblivious stateful workflow framework Temporal. We
report our experience in porting the code from traditional choreographed
microservice architecture to one orchestrated by Temporal and present our

item representations. In practice, these representations are highly entangled
as they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's
interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user
conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations
for inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when
the recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with
the user's interests).
  Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a
causal perspective. The exposure and the ratings are analogous to the treatment
and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical
challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These
confounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them. On the other hand,
since these confounders affect both the exposure and the ratings, it is
essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To better
approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information
(i.e., user-social and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how
users discover and interact with an item. Aside from the user conformity,
aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network
information is also captured in our method with the aid of \textit{causal
disentanglement} which unravels the learned representations into independent
factors that are responsible for (a) modeling the exposure of an item to the
user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders.
Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed

inception of algorithmic mechanism design \cite{NR99}. It is a resource
allocation problem that entails assigning $m$ tasks to $n$ machines for
execution. Machines are regarded as strategic agents who may lie about their
execution costs so as to minimize their allocated workload. To address the
situation when monetary payment is not an option to compensate the machines'
costs, \citeauthor{DBLP:journals/mst/Koutsoupias14} [2014] devised two
\textit{truthful} mechanisms, K and P respectively, that achieve an
approximation ratio of $\frac{n+1}{2}$ and $n$, for social cost minimization.
In addition, no truthful mechanism can achieve an approximation ratio better
than $\frac{n+1}{2}$. Hence, mechanism K is optimal. While approximation ratio
provides a strong worst-case guarantee, it also limits us to a comprehensive
understanding of mechanism performance on various inputs. This paper
investigates these two scheduling mechanisms beyond the worst case. We first
show that mechanism K achieves a smaller social cost than mechanism P on every
input. That is, mechanism K is pointwise better than mechanism P. Next, for
each task $j$, when machines' execution costs $t_i^j$ are independent and
identically drawn from a task-specific distribution $F^j(t)$, we show that the
average-case approximation ratio of mechanism K converges to a constant. This
bound is tight for mechanism K. For a better understanding of this distribution
dependent constant, on the one hand, we estimate its value by plugging in a few
common distributions; on the other, we show that this converging bound improves
a known bound \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/Zhang18} which only captures the single-task
setting. Last, we find that the average-case approximation ratio of mechanism P
converges to the same constant.

aerosol (dust) particles can act to seed the breakdown of air observed above
the 200 GW/cm$^2$ threshold when a train of 3 ps 10.6 $\mu$m laser pulses
separated by 18 ps are used. The breakdown first appears at the best focus but
propagates backwards towards the focusing optic as the plasma density
approaches critical density and makes forward propagation impossible. The
velocity of the backward propagating breakdown can be as high as 10$^9$ cm/s,
an order of magnitude greater than measured with ns pulse-produced breakdown
and can be explained rather well by the so-called breakdown wave mechanism.
Transverse plasma expansion with a similar velocity is assisted by UV
photoionization and is observed as a secondary longitudinal breakdown mechanism
in roughly 10 percent of the shots. When a cm size, TW power beam is
propagated, interception of aerosol particles is guaranteed and several (40
cm$^{-3}$) breakdown sites appear, each initially producing a near critical
density plasma. On a 10 ns-1 $\mu$s timescale, shockwaves from each site expand
radially and coalesce to produce a large hot gas channel. The radial velocity
of the expansion agrees well with the prediction of the blast wave theory
developed for ultrafast atmospheric detonations.

  inverted by boundary electron emission","letter",,"10.1063/5.0096316",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Electron emission from the boundary is ubiquitous in capacitively coupled
plasma (CCP) and precipitates nonnegligible influences on the discharge
properties. Here we present the PIC-MCC simulation of an Ohmic-dominant heating
mode of capacitively coupled plasma where the stochastic heating vanishes and
only Ohmic heating sustains the discharge, due to sheath inversion by boundary
electron emission. The inverted CCP features negative sheath potential without
Bohm presheath, hence excluding plasma heating due to sheath edge oscillation.
The particle and energy transport of the proposed heating mode is analyzed. The
influences of boundary electron emission flux, source voltage, and neutral
pressure on the transition between classic and Ohmic-dominant CCP heating modes
are shown with designated simulation scans. A modified inverse sheath-plasma
coupling due to excessive ionization is discovered. In the end, key indicators
of the proposed heating mode in plasma diagnostics are provided for future
experimental verifications.

the world. Early therapeutics of MI can ensure the prevention of further
myocardial necrosis. Echocardiography is the fundamental imaging technique that
can reveal the earliest sign of MI. However, the scarcity of echocardiographic
datasets for the MI detection is the major issue for training data-driven
classification algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for early
detection of MI over multi-view echocardiography that leverages one-class
classification (OCC) techniques. The OCC techniques are used to train a model
for detecting a specific target class using instances from that particular
category only. We investigated the usage of uni-modal and multi-modal one-class
classification techniques in the proposed framework using the HMC-QU dataset
that includes apical 4-chamber (A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C) views in a
total of 260 echocardiography recordings. Experimental results show that the
multi-modal approach achieves a sensitivity level of 85.23% and F1-Score of

require millions of training samples to converge to an adequate policy. One way
to combat this issue is to use action advising in a teacher-student framework,
where a knowledgeable teacher provides action advice to help the student. This
work considers how to better leverage uncertainties about when a student should
ask for advice and if the student can model the teacher to ask for less advice.
The student could decide to ask for advice when it is uncertain or when both it
and its model of the teacher are uncertain. In addition to this investigation,
this paper introduces a new method to compute uncertainty for a deep RL agent
using a secondary neural network. Our empirical results show that using dual

fourth of Titan's year (2006-2014, LS=318{\deg}-60{\deg}), using eighteen

eight chemical species (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C4H2, C6H6, HCN, HC3N) and haze
particles are retrieved from these observations using an instrument forward
model, which considers the technical issue of pointing motion. The Markov-chain

of the species profiles is noticeable before the equinox, while the decrease of
atmospheric temperature and significant upwelling in the summer hemisphere are
found five terrestrial years afterwards. Altitude of the detached haze layer
decreases towards the vernal equinox then it disappears, and no reappearance is
identified within the time range of our data, which is consistent with
observations from Cassini/ISS. This study provides observational constraints on

generations in globular clusters under the constraints generated by feedback
from massive stars as well as radiative cooling and the metallicity of the
primordial clouds. Our calculations are based on two main constraints to the
star formation efficiency of the first stellar generation (1G) $\epsilon_{1G}$.
First, $\epsilon_{1G}$ is restricted to warrant that stellar winds and
supernovae do not disrupt the leftover gas out of which a second generation
(2G) would form. Second, $\epsilon_{1G}$ is also limited such that the
metallicity enhancement caused by trapped supernovae is, in agreement with the
observations, not larger than $\sim$ 0.1 dex. Several central parameters define
the globular clusters end result: the mass and radius of the primordial clouds,
their metallicity and $\epsilon_{1G}$. The parameter space composed by models
which fulfilled all constraints, is here shown to coincide remarkably well with
the scattered observed anti-correlation between the fraction of first
generation stars ($f_{\textrm{1G}}$) and total cluster mass. Our models also
discern, in agreement with the data, between single and multiple population
clusters in a metallicity versus mass (or radius) plane. Hence, our results
suggest that the presence of multiple stellar populations is closely linked to
the ability of proto-globular clusters to retain a fraction of leftover gas.

voice activity detection (VAD), spoken language identification (SLI), and
automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe the metalinguistic content,
which an authorised person can quickly scan to triage recordings that can be
annotated by people with lower levels of access. We report work-in-progress

Our collaborative work with the Muruwari custodian of the archival materials

only from sound images. As a result of performance verification, CL-VAE could
estimate human instance segmentations more accurately than conventional

Moreover, compared to previous market designs, our market decomposes the

However, high inclinations are required in order to greatly excite the

novel pathway through which compact binaries could merge due to eccentricity
increase in general, including in a near coplanar configuration. Specifically,
a compact binary migrating in an AGN disk could be captured in an evection
resonance, when the precession rate of the binary equals their orbital period
around the supermassive black hole. In our study we include precession to due
first-order post Newtonian precession as well as that due to disk around one or
both components of the binary. Eccentricity is excited when the binary sweeps
through the resonance which happens only when it migrates on a timescale 10-100
times the libration timescale of the resonance. Libration timescale decreases
as the mass of the disk increases. The eccentricity excitation of the binary
can reduce the merger timescale by a factor up to $\sim 10^{3-5}$.

create a variety of spin-spin interactions for quantum magnets, including those
that exhibit frustration by driving different vibrational modes and
adiabatically prepare the corresponding ground states. The experimentally
measured ground states are consistent with the theoretical predictions and are
highly degenerate for geometrically frustrated spin models in two dimensions.
Quantum coherence of the ground states is probed by reversing the time
evolution of the B-field to the initial value and then measuring the extent to
which the remaining state coincides with the initial state. Our results open

that incorporates uncertainty in the prediction function and is compatible with
a wide range of machine learning models (e.g., tree ensembles, kernel methods,

$f(\mathbf{x})$, we consider quantifying the importance of an input variable
$\mathbf{x}^j$ using the integrated partial derivative $\Psi_j = \Vert
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}^j} f(\mathbf{x})\Vert^2_{P_\mathcal{X}}$.
We then (1) provide a principled approach for quantifying variable selection
uncertainty by deriving its posterior distribution, and (2) show that the
approach is generalizable even to non-differentiable models such as tree
ensembles. Rigorous Bayesian nonparametric theorems are derived to guarantee
the posterior consistency and asymptotic uncertainty of the proposed approach.
Extensive simulations and experiments on healthcare benchmark datasets confirm
that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing classic and recent variable

Previous simulations studying winds only focus on a small dynamical range.
Therefore, it is unknown how far the winds can go and what the properties of
the winds will be if they can move to large radii. We perform simulations to
study the large scale dynamics of winds driven by line force. We find that the
properties of the winds depend on both black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and accretion
disk luminosity. When the accretion disk luminosity is $0.6L_{edd}$ ($L_{edd}$
being Eddington luminosity), independent of $M_{BH}$, the winds have kinetic
energy flux exceeding $1\% L_{edd}$ and can escape from the black hole
potential. For the case with the accretion disk luminosity equaling
0.3$L_{edd}$, the strength of the winds decreases with the decrease of
$M_{BH}$. If $M_{BH}$ decreases from $10^9$ to $10^6$ solar mass ($M_\odot$),
the winds kinetic energy flux decreases from $\sim 0.01 L_{edd}$ to $ \sim
10^{-6} L_{edd}$. In case of $M_{BH}\geq 10^7 M_\odot$, winds can escape from
black hole potential. In the case of $M_{BH}=10^6 M_\odot$, the winds can not
escape. We find that for the ultra-fast winds observed in hard X-ray bands
(\citealt{Gofford et al. 2015}), the observed dependence of the mass flux and
the kinetic energy flux on accretion disk luminosity can be well produced by
line force driven winds model. We also find that the properties of the
ultra-fast winds observed in soft X-ray bands can be explained by the line
force driven winds model.

explored suitable evaluation measures for ordinal quantification tasks. More
specifically, the present study defines and evaluates, in addition to the
quantification measures considered earlier, a few variants of an ordinal
quantification measure called Root Normalised Order-aware Divergence (RNOD), as
well as a measure which we call Divergence based on Kendall's $\tau$ (DNKT).
The RNOD variants represent alternative design choices based on the idea of
Sakai's Distance-Weighted sum of squares (DW), while DNKT is designed to ensure
that the system's estimated distribution over classes is faithful to the target
priorities over classes. As this Priority Preserving Property (PPP) of DNKT may
be useful in some applications, we also consider combining some of the existing
quantification measures with DNKT. Our experiments with eight ordinal
quantification data sets suggest that the variants of RNOD do not offer any
benefit over the original RNOD at least in terms of system ranking consistency,
i.e., robustness of the system ranking to the choice of test data. Of all
ordinal quantification measures considered in this study (including Normalised
Match Distance, a.k.a. Earth Mover's Distance), RNOD is the most robust measure
overall. Hence the design choice of RNOD is a good one from this viewpoint.
Also, DNKT is the worst performer in terms of system ranking consistency.
Hence, if DNKT seems appropriate for a task, sample size design should take its
statistical instability into account.

address this issue, this paper designs the ensemble diverse hypotheses and
knowledge distillation (EDHKD) method to realize unsupervised cross-subject
adaptation. EDH mitigates the divergence between labeled data of source
subjects and unlabeled data of target subjects to accurately classify the
locomotion modes of target subjects without labeling data. Compared to previous
domain adaptation methods based on the single learner, which may only learn a
subset of features from input signals, EDH can learn diverse features by
incorporating multiple diverse feature generators and thus increases the
accuracy and decreases the variance of classifying target data, but it
sacrifices the efficiency. To solve this problem, EDHKD (student) distills the
knowledge from the EDH (teacher) to a single network to remain efficient and
accurate. The performance of the EDHKD is theoretically proved and
experimentally validated on a 2D moon dataset and two public human locomotion
datasets. Experimental results show that the EDHKD outperforms all other
methods. The EDHKD can classify target data with 96.9%, 94.4%, and 97.4%

to simulated signals to extract quantitative tissue parameters. A critical
drawback to this approach is the exponentially increasing compute time for
mapping of multiple parameters. Previously, a deep learning (DL) reconstruction
method called DRONE was shown to overcome this constraint by mapping the
magnitude time-series signal to the underlying tissue parameters. However,
relaxometry from magnitude images is susceptible to errors arising from
ambiguities in the zero crossing of the signal or the non-zero noise mean. The
aim of this study is to develop rapid acquisition and quantification methods to
enable accurate multiparametric tissue mapping from complex data. An optimized
EPI based MRF sequence is developed along with a novel phasesensitive DL
quantification allowing the use of real-valued neural networks to reconstruct
complex measured data and providing an additional quantitative map of the
phase. Phantom experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. A
comparison to previous DRONE methods in a healthy subject shows improved
fidelity to known T1 and T2 values for the phase-sensitive approach. By
processing the estimated phase map with conventional quantitative
susceptibility mapping algorithms, we demonstrate the feasibility of
simultaneous quantification of proton density, T1, T2, transmitter B1+ field
and the quantitative susceptibility maps. In vivo experiments in a healthy
volunteer and a subject with metastatic brain cancer are used to illustrate
potential applications of this technology for treatment response assessment and
tumor characterization.

optimizing the trade-off between multiple objectives including compressed data
rate, analytics performance, and computation speed. In this work, we consider a

object detection model. We propose a learnable feature compression approach to
compress the intermediate YOLO features with light-weight computation. We train
the feature compression and decompression module together with the YOLO model
to optimize the object detection accuracy under a rate constraint. Compared to
baseline methods that apply either standard image compression or learned image
compression at the mobile and perform image decompression and YOLO at the edge,
the proposed system achieves higher detection accuracy at the low to medium

mechanism can significantly improve performance and efficiency of social
decisions under desired objectives, such as to maximize social welfare or to
maximize revenue for agents. However, mechanism design is challenging for many
common models including the public project problem model which we study in this
thesis. A typical public project problem is a group of agents crowdfunding a
public project (e.g., building a bridge). The mechanism will decide the payment
and allocation for each agent (e.g., how much the agent pays, and whether the
agent can use it) according to their valuations. The mechanism can be applied
to various economic scenarios, including those related to cyber security. There
are different constraints and optimized objectives for different public project
scenarios (sub-problems), making it unrealistic to design a universal mechanism
that fits all scenarios, and designing mechanisms for different settings
manually is a taxing job. Therefore, we explore automated mechanism design
(AMD) of public project problems under different constraints.
  In this thesis, we focus on the public project problem, which includes many
sub-problems (excludable/non-excludable, divisible/indivisible,
binary/non-binary). We study the classical public project model and extend this
model to other related areas such as the zero-day exploit markets. For
different sub-problems of the public project problem, we adopt different novel
machine learning techniques to design optimal or near-optimal mechanisms via
automated mechanism design. We evaluate our mechanisms by theoretical analysis
or experimentally comparing our mechanisms against existing mechanisms. The
experiments and theoretical results show that our mechanisms are better than
state-of-the-art automated or manual mechanisms.

dimensional space (2D). From a control system standpoint, path following can be
formulated as the problem of stabilizing a path following error system that
describes the dynamics of position and possibly orientation errors of a vehicle
with respect to a path, with the errors defined in an appropriate reference
frame. In spite of the large variety of path following methods described in the
literature we show that, in principle, most of them can be categorized in two
groups: stabilization of the path following error system expressed either in
the vehicle's body frame or in a frame attached to a ""reference point"" moving
along the path, such as a Frenet-Serret (F-S) frame or a Parallel Transport
(P-T) frame. With this observation, we provide a unified formulation that is
simple but general enough to cover many methods available in the literature. We
then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method, comparing them
from the design and implementation standpoint. We further show experimental
results of the path following methods obtained from field trials testing with
under-actuated and fully-actuated autonomous marine vehicles. In addition, we
introduce open-source Matlab and Gazebo/ROS simulation toolboxes that are

of SOAM coupling and Raman-induced spin-flip hopping, engineered by lasers that
couples different hyperfine spin states. In the presence of SOAM coupling only,
we find rich quantum phases in the Mott-insulating regime, which support
different types of spin defects such as spin vortex and composite vortex with
antiferromagnetic core surrounded by the outer spin vortex. Based on an
effective exchange model, we find that these competing spin textures are a
result of the interplay of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Heisenberg exchange
interactions. In the presence of both SOAM coupling and Raman-induced spin-flip
hopping, more many-body phases appear, including canted-antiferromagnetic and

the coprime array structure and coprime frequency offsets, a two-dimensional
space-frequency virtual difference coarray corresponding to uniform array and
uniform frequency offset is considered to increase the number of
degrees-of-freedom (DoFs). However, the reconstruction of the doubly-Toeplitz

propose an interpolation algorithm based on decoupled atomic norm minimization
(DANM), which converts the coarray signal to a simple matrix form. On this
basis, a relaxation-based optimization problem is formulated to achieve joint
DoA-range estimation with enhanced DoFs. The reconstructed coarray signal
enables application of existing subspace-based spectral estimation methods. The
proposed DANM problem is further reformulated as an equivalent
rank-minimization problem which is solved by cyclic rank minimization. This
approach avoids the approximation errors introduced in nuclear norm-based
approach, thereby achieving superior root-mean-square error which is closer to
the Cramer-Rao bound. The effectiveness of proposed method is confirmed by

The classical optimizer is required to perform well in the presence of noise in
the objective function evaluations, or else it becomes the weakest link in the
algorithm. We introduce the use of Gaussian Processes (GP) as surrogate models
to reduce the impact of noise and to provide high quality seeds to escape local
minima, whether real or noise-induced. We build this as a framework on top of
local optimizations, for which we choose Implicit Filtering (ImFil) in this
study. ImFil is a state-of-the-art, gradient-free method, which in comparative
studies has been shown to outperform on noisy VQE problems. The result is a new
method: ""GP+ImFil"". We show that when noise is present, the GP+ImFil approach
finds results closer to the true global minimum in fewer evaluations than
standalone ImFil, and that it works particularly well for larger dimensional
problems. Using GP to seed local searches in a multi-modal landscape shows
mixed results: although it is capable of improving on ImFil standalone, it does

transport in quantum-coherent conductors. Due to the Pauli exclusion principle,
electron emission events are usually correlated. This makes the emission rate
is not a constant, but depends on the history of the emission process. To
incorporate such history dependence, in this paper we characterize the emission
rate via the conditional intensity function, which has been introduced in the
theory of random point process. The conditional intensity function can be
treated as the instantaneous emission rate observed by an ideal single-electron
detector since a given starting time. We demonstrate the method by studying the
instantaneous emission rate of a single-channel quantum point contact driven by
a constant voltage. As the quantum point contact is opened up, we show that the
emission process evolves from a simple Poisson process close to pinch-off to a
non-renewal process at full transmission. These results shows that the
conditional intensity function can provide an intuitive and unified description
of the emission process in quantum-coherent conductors.

considering additive manufacturing limitations. The presented method considers
the minimum size of parts, the minimum size of cavities, the inability of
printing overhanging parts without the use of sacrificial supporting
structures, and the printing directions. These constraints are geometrically
addressed and implemented. The minimum size on solid and void zones is imposed
through a well-known filtering technique. The sacrificial support material is
reduced using a constraint that limits the maximum overhang angle of parts by
comparing the structural gradient with a critical reference slope. Due to the
local nature of the gradient, the chosen restriction is prone to introduce
parts that meet the structural slope but that may not be self-supporting. The
restriction limits the maximum overhang angle for a user-defined printing
direction, which could reduce structural performance if the orientation is not
properly selected. To ease these challenges, a new approach to reduce the
introduction of such non-self-supporting parts and a novel method that includes
different printing directions in the maximum overhang angle constraint are
presented. The proposed strategy for considering the minimum size of solid and
void phases, maximum overhang angle, and printing direction, is illustrated by
solving a set of 2D benchmark design problems including stiff structures and
compliant mechanisms. We also provide MATLAB codes in the appendix for
educational purposes and for replication of the results.

topology shapes of lane lines and distinguishing different types of lanes
simultaneously. Earlier works follow a top-down roadmap to regress predefined
anchors into various shapes of lane lines, which lacks enough flexibility to
fit complex shapes of lanes due to the fixed anchor shapes. Lately, some works
propose to formulate lane detection as a keypoint estimation problem to
describe the shapes of lane lines more flexibly and gradually group adjacent
keypoints belonging to the same lane line in a point-by-point manner, which is
inefficient and time-consuming during postprocessing. In this paper, we propose
a Global Association Network (GANet) to formulate the lane detection problem
from a new perspective, where each keypoint is directly regressed to the
starting point of the lane line instead of point-by-point extension.
Concretely, the association of keypoints to their belonged lane line is
conducted by predicting their offsets to the corresponding starting points of
lanes globally without dependence on each other, which could be done in
parallel to greatly improve efficiency. In addition, we further propose a
Lane-aware Feature Aggregator (LFA), which adaptively captures the local
correlations between adjacent keypoints to supplement local information to the
global association. Extensive experiments on two popular lane detection
benchmarks show that our method outperforms previous methods with F1 score of
79.63% on CULane and 97.71% on Tusimple dataset with high FPS. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Wolfwjs/GANet.

sentiment analysis (ABSA). Given a sentence and an aspect term occurring in the
sentence, TOWE extracts the corresponding opinion words for the aspect term.
TOWE has two types of instance. In the first type, aspect terms are associated
with at least one opinion word, while in the second type, aspect terms do not
have corresponding opinion words. However, previous researches trained and
evaluated their models with only the first type of instance, resulting in a
sample selection bias problem. Specifically, TOWE models were trained with only
the first type of instance, while these models would be utilized to make
inference on the entire space with both the first type of instance and the
second type of instance. Thus, the generalization performance will be hurt.
Moreover, the performance of these models on the first type of instance cannot
reflect their performance on entire space. To validate the sample selection
bias problem, four popular TOWE datasets containing only aspect terms
associated with at least one opinion word are extended and additionally include
aspect terms without corresponding opinion words. Experimental results on these
datasets show that training TOWE models on entire space will significantly
improve model performance and evaluating TOWE models only on the first type of

expansion, can be used to trigger dramatic elastic instabilities in thin
shells. These instabilities originate in geometric incompatibility between the
preferred extrinsic and intrinsic curvature of the shell, which may be modified
by active deformations through the thickness and in plane respectively. Here,
we solve the simplest possible model of such instabilities, which assumes the
shells are shallow, thin enough to bend but not stretch, and subject to
homogeneous preferred curvatures. We consider separately the cases of zero,
positive and negative Gaussian curvature. We identify two types of
super-critical symmetry breaking instability, in which the shell's principal
curvature spontaneously breaks discrete up-down symmetry and continuous planar
isotropy respectively. These are then augmented by inversion instabilities, in
which the shell jumps sub-critically between up/down broken symmetry states,
and rotation instabilities, in which the curvatures rotate by 90 degrees
between states of broken isotropy without release of energy. Each instability
has a thickness independent threshold value for the preferred extrinsic
curvature proportional to the square-root of Gauss curvature. Finally, we show
that the threshold for the isotropy-breaking instability is the same for deep
spherical caps, in good agreement with recently published data.

that high global similarity of medical images in terms of anatomy hampers
instance discrimination methods for capturing a set of distinct features,
negatively impacting their performance on medical downstream tasks. To
alleviate this limitation, we have developed a simple yet effective
self-supervised framework, called Context-Aware instance Discrimination (CAiD).
CAiD aims to improve instance discrimination learning by providing finer and
more discriminative information encoded from a diverse local context of

utility of the learned features from a three-pronged perspective: (i)
generalizability and transferability, (ii) separability in the embedding space,

enriches representations learned from existing instance discrimination methods;

contextual information from individual medial images; and (3) improves

resolve $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binaries, while the rest will generate a

radiation emitted by a galaxy can be related to the underlying total stellar
mass, in this work we propose a framework to infer the same quantity by
investigating the spectral shape and amplitude of the confusion foreground
signal. For a fixed DWD evolution model, and thus a fixed binary fraction, we
retrieve percentage-level relative errors on the total stellar mass, which
improves for increasing values of the mass. At the same time, we find that
variations in the Milky Way shape, at a fixed mass and at scale heights smaller

alone. We perform this analysis on simulations of the LISA data, estimating the
resolvable sources based on signal-to-noise criteria. Finally, we utilize the

metal dichalcogenide heterostructures with potential applications in
optoelectronics. Critical for carrier and exciton transport is the quality of
the two materials that constitute the monolayer and the nature of the lateral
heterojunction. Important details of the optical properties were inaccessible
in as-grown heterostructure samples due to large inhomogeneous broadening of
the optical transitions. Here we perform optical spectroscopy at T = 4 K and
also at 300 K to access the optical transitions in CVD grown MoSe2-WSe2 lateral
heterostructures that are transferred from the growth-substrate and are
encapsulated in hBN. Photoluminescence (PL), reflectance contrast and Raman
spectroscopy reveal considerably narrowed optical transition linewidth similar
to high quality exfoliated monolayers. In high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) we find near-atomically sharp junctions with a typical
extent of 3nm for the covalently bonded MoSe2-WSe2. In PL imaging experiments
we find effective excitonic diffusion length that are longer for WSe2 than for
MoSe2 at low T=4 K, whereas at 300 K this trend is reversed.

variability across clients. We show that our framework can be effectively
optimized through expectation maximization (EM) over latent master's

privacy (DP) guarantees compatibly with our EM optimization scheme. We tested
our method on the analysis of multi-modal medical imaging data and clinical
scores from distributed clinical datasets of patients affected by Alzheimer's
disease. We demonstrate that our method is robust when data is distributed
either in iid and non-iid manners, even when local parameters perturbation is
included to provide DP guarantees. Moreover, the variability of data, views and

high-quality data reconstruction as compared to state-of-the-art autoencoding

light of this, we've concentrated on developing an EEG classification framework

using only data acquired from separate subjects previously. For this purpose,
in this paper, we proposed a framework that employs the open-set recognition
technique as an auxiliary task to learn subject-specific style features from
the source dataset while helping the shared feature extractor with mapping the
features of the unseen target dataset as a new unseen domain. Our aim is to
impose cross-instance style in-variance in the same domain and reduce the open

generalization ability of the shared feature extractor. Our experiments showed
that using the domain information as an auxiliary network increases the

investigated the neural signals for two groups of native speakers with two
tasks with different languages, English and Chinese. Our assumption was that
English, a non-tonal and phonogram-based language, would have spectral
differences in neural computation compared to Chinese, a tonal and
ideogram-based language. The results showed the significant difference in the
relative power spectral density between English and Chinese in specific
frequency band groups. Also, the spatial evaluation of Chinese native speakers
in the theta band was distinctive during the imagination task. Hence, this
paper would suggest the key spectral and spatial information of word
imagination with specialized language while decoding the neural signals of

unexpected an event is. Statistical language models provide a probabilistic
approximation of natural languages, and because surprisal is constructed with
the probability of an event occuring, it is therefore possible to determine the
surprisal associated with English sentences. The issues and pull requests of
software repository issue trackers give insight into the development process
and likely contain the surprising events of this process.
  Objective. Prior works have identified that unusual events in software
repositories are of interest to developers, and use simple code metrics-based
methods for detecting them. In this study we will propose a new method for
unusual event detection in software repositories using surprisal. With the
ability to find surprising issues and pull requests, we intend to further
analyse them to determine if they actually hold importance in a repository, or
if they pose a significant challenge to address. If it is possible to find bad
surprises early, or before they cause additional troubles, it is plausible that
effort, cost and time will be saved as a result.
  Method. After extracting the issues and pull requests from 5000 of the most
popular software repositories on GitHub, we will train a language model to
represent these issues. We will measure their perceived importance in the
repository, measure their resolution difficulty using several analogues,
measure the surprisal of each, and finally generate inferential statistics to
describe any correlations.

Pad\'{e} approximation for for cosmographic analysis, our results provides
model-independent estimation of the Hubble constant $H_0 =
72.24^{+2.73}_{-2.52} ~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 72.45^{+1.95}_{-2.02}
~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$, which is well consistent with that derived from the local
distance ladder by SH0ES collaboration. The measured cosmic curvature
$\Omega_k=0.062^{+0.117}_{-0.078}$ and $\Omega_k=0.069^{+0.116}_{-0.103}$ shows
that zero spatial curvature is supported by the current observations of strong
lensing time delays and cosmic chronometers. Imposing the prior of spatial
flatness leads to more precise (at 1.6$\%$ level) determination of the Hubble
constant $H_0=70.47^{+1.14}_{-1.15} ~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$ and
$H_0=71.66^{+1.15}_{-1.57} ~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$, a value located between the

further improved to $\Omega_k=0.123^{+0.060}_{-0.046}$ and
$\Omega_k=0.101^{+0.090}_{-0.072}$, supporting no significant deviation from a

propose to realize the nonclassical correlated deterministic photon pairs at

shown that the photon emissions for bimodal cavities exhibit a high single
photon purity and relatively large intracavity photon numbers, which are
ascribed to the combination of optical Stark shift enhanced energy-spectrum
anharmonicity and quantum interference suppressed two-photon excitation. Our
scheme generates photon-photon pairs with strong photon blockade for cavity
modes via constructing a highly tunable cavity-enhanced deterministic
parametric down-conversion process. Furthermore, we show that the
cross-correlation function between the two cavity modes vastly violates the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality of the classical boundary, which unambiguously
demonstrates the nonclassicality of the single-photon pairs. Our result reveals
a prominent strategy to generate the high-quality two-mode single-photon
sources with strong nonclassical correlation, which could provide versatile
applications in distribution of quantum networks, long distance quantum
communication, and fundamental tests of quantum physics.

parts in the input data (e.g., images, videos, or signals). It forms a crucial
component in enabling machines to have an insightful understanding of the
behaviors of humans, and has become a salient problem in computer vision and
related fields. Deep learning techniques allow learning feature representations
directly from the data, significantly pushing the performance boundary of human
pose estimation. In this paper, we reap the recent achievements of 2D human
pose estimation methods and present a comprehensive survey. Briefly, existing
approaches put their efforts in three directions, namely network architecture
design, network training refinement, and post processing. Network architecture
design looks at the architecture of human pose estimation models, extracting
more robust features for keypoint recognition and localization. Network
training refinement tap into the training of neural networks and aims to
improve the representational ability of models. Post processing further
incorporates model-agnostic polishing strategies to improve the performance of
keypoint detection. More than 200 research contributions are involved in this
survey, covering methodological frameworks, common benchmark datasets,
evaluation metrics, and performance comparisons. We seek to provide researchers
with a more comprehensive and systematic review on human pose estimation,

revisits the robustness-accuracy trade-off in robot learning by systematically

training suitable for real-world robot applications. We evaluate three
different robot learning tasks ranging from autonomous driving in a

the negative impact on the nominal accuracy caused by adversarial training

that although progress is happening, further advances in robust learning

then taken as the desired focal field, the band-limited waves of which are
backward propagated to the pupil plane via a reversal of the Richards--Wolf

paraxial by associating the longitudinal electric/magnetic field component with
the radial one on the reference sphere. The inversely designed pupil field in
turn is propagated forwardly into the focal region to generate the designed
focal field, whose distribution over the nanostructure's surface is used to
evaluate the overlap between the designed focal field and the modal fields,
i.e., the modal expansion coefficients. Studies for a silicon nanodisk monomer,

using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that the
net-cationic silica precursor TMAPS induces substantial condensation of the DNA
origami, which is further enhanced by the addition of TEOS at early reaction
times to an almost 10 % size reduction. We identify the SAXS Porod invariant as
a reliable, model-free parameter for the evaluation of the amount of silica

more than 40 % of the internal hydration water causes a hydrophobic effect:
origami condensation. In the maximally condensed state, thermal stabilization
of the origami up to 60 {\deg}C could be observed. If the reaction is driven
beyond this point, the overall size of the silicified origami increases again
due to more and more silica deposition on the DNA origami. DNA origami objects
with flat surfaces show a strong tendency towards aggregation during

condensation. Our studies provide novel insights into the silicification

finite-time operation incurs additional energetic costs. We find a tight
finite-time Landauer's bound by establishing a general form of the classical

with the additional cost of a highly irreversible process, which scales
differently from a nearly irreversible process. We also find an optimal

changes in $A$ related to solar cycle phase are in accordance with previously
reported theoretical and experimental results (higher $A$ during solar minimum,
lower $A$ during the maximum of activity), while changes in $B$ differ from the
theoretical predictions as we observe more negative values of $B$, that is, a
more pronounced DR during activity maximum. The main result of this paper for
the long-term variations in $A$ is the detection of a phase shift between the
activity flip (in the 1970s) and the equatorial rotation velocity flip (in the
early 1990s). During this time period both $A$ and activity show a secular
decreasing trend, indicating their correlation. Therefore, the theoretical
model fails in the phase-shift time period that occurs after the modern
Gleissberg maximum, while in the time period thereafter (after the 1990s),
theoretical and experimental results are consistent. The long-term variations
in $B$ in general yield an anticorrelation of $B$ and activity, as a rise of
$B$ is observed during the entire time period (1964-2016) we analysed, during
which activity decreased. We study for the first time the variation in solar DR

were produced by these simulations. Significant changes in the dust yield were
caused by changing the mass loss rates of the stars, with a greater mass loss
rate contributing to increased dust yields. Similarly, a close orbit between
the stars also resulted in higher dust yields. Finally, a high velocity wind
shear, which induces Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities and wind mixing,
drastically increases the dust yields.

even zero, which results in large counting errors. To address this problem, we
are the first to propose the Hard Example Focusing(HEF) algorithm for the
regression task of crowd counting. The HEF algorithm makes our model rapidly
focus on hard examples by attenuating the contribution of easy examples.Then
higher importance will be given to the hard examples with wrong estimations.
Moreover, the scale variations in crowd scenes are large, and the scale
annotations are labor-intensive and expensive. By proposing a multi-Scale
Semantic Refining (SSR) strategy, lower layers of our model can break through
the limitation of deep learning to capture semantic features of different
scales to sufficiently deal with the scale variation. We perform extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets to verify the proposed method. Results
indicate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, our designed model is smaller and faster.

through four fluxes: precipitation, evaporation, runoff and atmospheric

well-being. However, predicting how the water cycle responds to changes in
vegetation cover, remains a challenge (Lawrence and Vandecar, 2015; Ellison et

disproportionally with reduced forest transpiration following deforestation
(Baudena et al., 2021). Here, combining these findings with the law of matter
conservation, we show that in a sufficiently wet atmosphere forest
transpiration can control atmospheric moisture convergence such that increased
transpiration enhances atmospheric moisture import. Conversely, in a drier
atmosphere increased transpiration reduces atmospheric moisture convergence and
runoff. This previously unrecognized dichotomy can explain the seemingly random
observations of runoff and soil moisture sometimes increasing and sometimes
reducing in response to re-greening (e.g., Zheng et al., 2021). Evaluating the
transition between the two regimes is crucial both for characterizing the risk
posed by deforestation as well as for motivating and guiding global ecosystem

initialisation method on GE's performance. While recent work has shed light on
the matters of initialisation and grammar design with respect to GE, their
impact on other methods, such as random search and context-free grammar genetic

and CFG-GP under a range of benchmark problems using several different
initialisation routines and grammar designs. The results suggest that CFG-GP is
less sensitive to initialisation and grammar design than both GE and random

this requires learning from few, often single, samples. Memory augmented neural

stored in an off-chip memory due to its size. Therefore the practical use has
been heavily limited. Previous works on emerging memory-based implementation
have difficulties in scaling up because different modules with various
structures are difficult to integrate on the same chip and the small sense
margin of the content addressable memory for the memory module heavily limited
the degree of mismatch calculation. In this work, we implement the entire
memory augmented neural network architecture in a fully integrated memristive
crossbar platform and achieve an accuracy that closely matches standard
software on digital hardware for the Omniglot dataset. The successful
demonstration is supported by implementing new functions in crossbars in
addition to widely reported matrix multiplications. For example, the
locality-sensitive hashing operation is implemented in crossbar arrays by
exploiting the intrinsic stochasticity of memristor devices. Besides, the
content-addressable memory module is realized in crossbars, which also supports
the degree of mismatches. Simulations based on experimentally validated models
show such an implementation can be efficiently scaled up for one-shot learning

the concept of polar subcode, we then derive an upper bound on the conditional

accuracy, previous studies have attempted to control the distribution of binary
activation by manually shifting the threshold of the activation function or
making the shift amount trainable. During the process, they usually depended on
statistical information computed from a batch. We argue that using statistical

The Cardy-Rabinovici model is the $4$d $U(1)$ gauge theory with electric and

low-energies. $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ self-duality does not realize in a naive way,

duality operation by performing the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ $1$-form symmetry
with including the level-$p$ discrete topological term. Due to such
complications in its realization, the fusion rule of duality defects becomes a
non-group-like structure, and thus the self-duality symmetry is realized as a
non-invertible symmetry. Moreover, for some fixed points of the self-duality,
the duality symmetry turns out to have a mixed gravitational anomaly detected
on a $K3$ surface, and we can rule out the trivially gapped phase as a
consequence of anomaly matching. We also uncover how the conjectured phase

high inference efficiency have also shown promising performance, however, they
only consider instance-level alignment between the two streams (thus there is
still room for improvement). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
COllaborative Two-Stream vision-language pretraining model termed COTS for
image-text retrieval by enhancing cross-modal interaction. In addition to
instance level alignment via momentum contrastive learning, we leverage two
extra levels of cross-modal interactions in our COTS: (1) Token-level
interaction - a masked visionlanguage modeling (MVLM) learning objective is

devised between text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks, where the
probability distribution per task is computed with the negative queues in
momentum contrastive learning. Under a fair comparison setting, our COTS
achieves the highest performance among all two-stream methods and comparable
performance (but with 10,800X faster in inference) w.r.t. the latest

irradiation from their host star, resulting in hydrospheres in supercritical
state. In this context, we explore the role of irradiation on small terrestrial
planets that are moderately wet in the low-mass regime (0.2--1$M_{\oplus}$). We
investigate their bulk properties for water contents in the 0.01--5\% range by
making use of an internal structure model that is coupled to an atmosphere
model. This coupling allows us to take into account both the compression of the
interior due to the weight of the hydrosphere and the possibility of
atmospheric instability in the low-mass regime. We show that even for low
masses and low water contents, these planets display inflated atmospheres. For
extremely low planetary masses and high irradiation temperatures, we find that
steam atmospheres become gravitationally unstable when the ratio $\eta$ of
their scale height to planetary radius exceeds a critical value of $\sim 0.1$.
This result is supported by observational data, as all currently detected
exoplanets exhibit values of $\eta$ smaller than 0.013. Depending on their
water content, our results show that highly irradiated and low-mass planets up
to $0.9M_{\oplus}$ with significative hydrospheres are not in stable form and
should loose their volatile envelope.

correlated with the Eddington ratio. Based on the Kormendy relation, we find
that the mean surface brightness of ellipticals and classical bulges in our

formation rates, regardless of the SFR tracer used, with recent starbursts
ending within the last 600 Myr. We present CO (3-2) observations for three

(four new) post-starburst galaxies. The post-starbursts have low excitation
traced by the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) up to CO (3-2), more
similar to early-type than starburst galaxies. The low excitation indicates
that lower density rather than high temperatures may suppress star formation

traced by CO (3-2). MaNGA observations show that the ionized gas velocity is
disturbed relative to the stellar velocity field, with a blueshifted component
aligned with the molecular gas outflow, suggestive of a multiphase outflow. Low
ratios of HCO+/CO, indicating low fractions of dense molecular gas relative to

a behavior that may hinder invariant object recognition. A locally linear
analysis suggests that the sensitivity is due to the existence of linear
combinations of active dictionary elements with high cancellation. A nearest

images. For a linear classifier with a sufficiently large number of labeled

Existing question answering methods answer all questions with a homogeneous

parameters, which will confuse the model decision for each single type of
questions. In this paper, in order to alleviate the parameter competition
problem, we propose a Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) based question answering method
called MoEBQA that decouples the computation for different types of questions
by sparse routing. To be specific, we split a pretrained Transformer model into
bottom and top blocks. The bottom blocks are shared by all the examples, aiming
to capture the general features. The top blocks are extended to an MoE version
that consists of a series of independent experts, where each example is
assigned to a few experts according to its underlying question type. MoEBQA
automatically learns the routing strategy in an end-to-end manner so that each
expert tends to deal with the question types it is expert in. We evaluate
MoEBQA on three BQA datasets constructed based on real examinations. The
results show that our MoE extension significantly boosts the performance of
question answering models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. In
addition, we elaborately analyze our MoE modules to reveal how MoEBQA works and

superconductivity. We demonstrate that low temperature properties of
superconducting nanowires are essentially determined by quantum fluctuations.
Smooth (Gaussian) fluctuations of the superconducting phase (also associated
with plasma modes propagating along the wire) may significantly affect the
electron density of states in such nanowires and induce persistent current
noise in superconducting nanorings. Further interesting phenomena such as,
e.g., non-vanishing resistance and shot noise of the voltage in current-biased
superconducting nanowires, are caused by non-Gaussian fluctuations of the order
parameter -- quantum phase slips (QPS). Such phenomena may be interpreted in
terms of tunneling of fluxons playing the role of effective quantum ""particles""
dual to Cooper pairs and obeying complicated full counting statistics which
reduces to Poissonian one in the low frequency limit. We also demonstrate that
QPS effects may be particularly pronounced in thinnest wires and rings where
quantum phase slips remain unbound and determine a non-perturbative length
scale $L_c$ beyond which the supercurrent gets suppressed by quantum
fluctuations. Accordingly, for $T \to 0$ such nanowires should become
insulating at scales exceeding $L_c$, whereas at shorter length scales they may
still exhibit superconducting properties. We argue that certain non-trivial
features associated with quantum fluctuations of the order parameter may be
sensitive to specific circuit topology and may be observed in structures like,
e.g., a system of capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires.

quantities. From the analytic point of view, solution of these equations
satisfy under certain conditions maximum principles, which represent physical
bounds of the solution. That the same bounds are respected by numerical
approximations of the solution is often of utmost importance in practice. The
mathematical formulation of this property, which contributes to the physical
consistency of a method, is called Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP). In many
applications, convection dominates diffusion by several orders of magnitude. It
is well known that standard discretizations typically do not satisfy the DMP in
this convection-dominated regime. In fact, in this case, it turns out to be a
challenging problem to construct discretizations that, on the one hand, respect
the DMP and, on the other hand, compute accurate solutions. This paper presents
a survey on finite element methods, with a main focus on the
convection-dominated regime, that satisfy a local or a global DMP. The concepts
of the underlying numerical analysis are discussed. The survey reveals that for
the steady-state problem there are only a few discretizations, all of them
nonlinear, that at the same time satisfy the DMP and compute reasonably
accurate solutions, e.g., algebraically stabilized schemes. Moreover, most of
these discretizations have been developed in recent years, showing the enormous
progress that has been achieved lately. Methods based on algebraic
stabilization, nonlinear and linear ones, are currently as well the only finite
element methods that combine the satisfaction of the global DMP and accurate
numerical results for the evolutionary equations in the convection-dominated
situation.

The modelling of such an intelligent physical system requires replicating the
knowledge-awareness capability in the virtual space. Novel equivalence
maintaining techniques are needed, especially in synchronising the knowledge
between the model and the physical system. This paper proposes the notion of
knowledge equivalence and an equivalence maintaining approach by knowledge

can tolerate deviation thus reducing unnecessary updates and achieve more

constructing both a prediction set around each object detection as well as

$E$. If these semigroups are linear, they are reconstructable through an Euler
formula from their strong derivative at zero in $(C_b(E), \tau_1^{\mathscr

Moreover, we introduce the notion of a Markov core operator $(L_0, D(L_0))$ for

Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations corresponding to $(L_0,D(L_0))$ for all

becomes rather collimated for eccentricity values $\gtrsim 0.75$. The

mass accretion rate $\dot{m}_c$ to Eddington units, the results of the model
are independent of black hole mass. State transitions should thus be similar in
X-ray binaries and AGN. The corona solution consists of two power-law segments
separated at a break radius $r_b \sim10^3 \,(\alpha/0.3)^{-2}$, where $\alpha$
is the viscosity parameter. Gas evaporates from the disk to the corona for
$r>r_b$, and condenses back for $r<r_b$. At $r_b$, $\dot{m}_c$ reaches its
maximum, $\dot{m}_{c,{\rm max}} \approx 0.02\, (\alpha/0.3)^3$. If at $r\gg
r_b$ the thin disk accretes with $\dot{m}_d < \dot{m}_{c,{\rm max}} $, then the
disk evaporates fully before reaching $r_b$, giving the hard state. Otherwise,
the disk survives at all radii, giving the thermal state. While the basic model
considers only bremsstrahlung cooling and viscous heating, we also discuss a
more realistic model which includes Compton cooling and direct coronal heating
by energy transport from the disk. Solutions are again independent of black
hole mass, and $r_b$ remains unchanged. This model predicts strong coronal

  Detection",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Code Clone Detection (CCD) is a software engineering task that is
used for plagiarism detection, code search, and code comprehension. Recently,
deep learning-based models have achieved an F1 score (a metric used to assess
classifiers) of $\sim$95\% on the CodeXGLUE benchmark. These models require
many training data, mainly fine-tuned on Java or C++ datasets. However, no
previous study evaluates the generalizability of these models where a limited
amount of annotated data is available.
  Objective: The main objective of this research is to assess the ability of
the CCD models as well as few shot learning algorithms for unseen programming
problems and new languages (i.e., the model is not trained on these
problems/languages).
  Method: We assess the generalizability of the state of the art models for CCD
in few shot settings (i.e., only a few samples are available for fine-tuning)
by setting three scenarios: i) unseen problems, ii) unseen languages, iii)
combination of new languages and new problems. We choose three datasets of
BigCloneBench, POJ-104, and CodeNet and Java, C++, and Ruby languages. Then, we
employ Model Agnostic Meta-learning (MAML), where the model learns a
meta-learner capable of extracting transferable knowledge from the train set;
so that the model can be fine-tuned using a few samples. Finally, we combine
contrastive learning with MAML to further study whether it can improve the
results of MAML.

physics. The present study aims to get a possible solution for the FYSP through
sun-like G stars and their exoplanetary systems. Using physical properties of
exoplanetary data, an empirical relationship between the rate of mass loss
($\frac{dM}{dt}$) with stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) and age ({\em t}) is
obtained. We found mass loss rate varies with stellar mass as $\propto$
$(M_{\star}/M_\odot)^{-3.788}$ and proportional to the age as $\propto$
t$^{-1.25}$, which indicates rate of mass loss is higher during early
evolutionary stages. Then we applied mass loss corrections to stellar masses of
G-type stars with planets and obtained their initial masses at the early
evolutionary stages. Subsequently, we applied these relationships to calculate
the mass loss rate and mass of Sun at the early evolutionary stage, which is
found to be $\sim$ 10$^{-11}$ solar mass per year and $\sim$ (1.061$\pm$0.006)
solar mass respectively. The higher solar mass can probably alleviate the
problem of the faint young Sun paradox. Then the estimated initial stellar
masses of the host stars are used to obtain a best power law relationship with
the planetary masses that supports the hypothesis that the {\em massive stars
harbour massive planets.} Finally, by using the same empirical power law,
planetary mass in the vicinity of Sun is estimated to be $\sim$ (0.84$\pm$0.19)
Jupiter mass, which is much higher compared to the present solar terrestrial
planetary mass. Hence, this study also suggests that there is a missing
planetary mass in the vicinity of the Sun, which can solve the FYSP problem.

observed for nine molecules and their average values across a sample of 29
comets to the predicted midplane ice abundances from models of the protosolar
nebula. Our fiducial model, where ices are inherited from the interstellar
medium, can account for the observed mixing ratio ranges of each molecule
considered, but no single location or time reproduces the abundances of all
molecules simultaneously. This suggests that each comet consists of material
processed under a range of conditions. In contrast, a model where the initial
composition of disk material is `reset', wiping out any previous chemical
history, cannot account for the complete range of abundances observed in
comets.
  Using toy models that combine material processed under different thermal
conditions we find that a combination of warm (CO-poor) and cold (CO-rich)
material is required to account for both the average properties of the
Jupiter-family and Oort cloud comets, and the individual comets we consider.
This could occur by the transport (either radial or vertical) of ice-coated
dust grains in the early solar system.

Particularly, centralization favors globally near-optimal decision-making but
at the cost of increased on-board resource requirements; whereas,
decentralization favors minimal resource requirements but at a global
suboptimality cost. All robots can thus afford our algorithm, irrespective of

multiple robots coordinating actions to complete resource-demanding tasks, such
as target tracking, area coverage, and monitoring. To provide closed-form

Montanari and Richard to study the computational difficulty of estimating an
unknown parameter from higher-order moment tensors. Unlike its matrix
counterpart, Tensor PCA exhibits a statistical-computational gap, i.e., a
sample size regime where the problem is information-theoretically solvable but
conjectured to be computationally hard. This paper derives computational lower
bounds on the run-time of memory bounded algorithms for Tensor PCA using
communication complexity. These lower bounds specify a trade-off among the
number of passes through the data sample, the sample size, and the memory
required by any algorithm that successfully solves Tensor PCA. While the lower
bounds do not rule out polynomial-time algorithms, they do imply that many
commonly-used algorithms, such as gradient descent and power method, must have
a higher iteration count when the sample size is not large enough. Similar
lower bounds are obtained for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis, a family of
statistical estimation problems in which low-order moment tensors carry no
information about the unknown parameter. Finally, stronger lower bounds are
obtained for an asymmetric variant of Tensor PCA and related statistical
estimation problems. These results explain why many estimators for these
problems use a memory state that is significantly larger than the effective
dimensionality of the parameter of interest.

machinery fault diagnosis. However, the main limitation that exists for these
methods is that they operate as a black box and are generally not
interpretable. This paper proposes a novel neural network structure, called
temporal logic neural network (TLNN), in which the neurons of the network are
logic propositions. More importantly, the network can be described and
interpreted as a weighted signal temporal logic. TLNN not only keeps the nice
properties of traditional neuron networks but also provides a formal
interpretation of itself with formal language. Experiments with real datasets
show the proposed neural network can obtain highly accurate fault diagnosis
results with good computation efficiency. Additionally, the embedded formal
language of the neuron network can provide explanations about the decision
process, thus achieve interpretable fault diagnosis.

carried out by microwave probing of spin waves with subsequent use of spatial
Fourier analysis of the complex wave amplitude for a series of frequencies. It
was found that every m-th mode of the backward volume spins wave can be split
into n satellite modes due to the existence of layers with similar magnetic
parameters in ferrite film. It was found that satellites of the first mode of
this wave are excited most effectively, while satellites of the third mode -
least effectively, and the effectiveness of satellites excitation decreases as
the number n increases. It is found that the theoretical dispersion

  production","37 pages, 24 figures",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  To maximize the economic benefits of geothermal energy production, it is
essential to optimize geothermal reservoir management strategies, in which
geologic uncertainty should be considered. In this work, we propose a
closed-loop optimization framework, based on deep learning surrogates, for the
well control optimization of geothermal reservoirs. In this framework, we
construct a hybrid convolution-recurrent neural network surrogate, which
combines the convolution neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
recurrent network. The convolution structure can extract spatial information of
geologic parameter fields and the recurrent structure can approximate
sequence-to-sequence mapping. The trained model can predict time-varying
production responses (rate, temperature, etc.) for cases with different
permeability fields and well control sequences. In the closed-loop optimization
framework, production optimization based on the differential evolution (DE)
algorithm, and data assimilation based on the iterative ensemble smoother
(IES), are performed alternately to achieve real-time well control optimization
and geologic parameter estimation as the production proceeds. In addition, the
averaged objective function over the ensemble of geologic parameter estimations
is adopted to consider geologic uncertainty in the optimization process.
Several geothermal reservoir development cases are designed to test the
performance of the proposed production optimization framework. The results show
that the proposed framework can achieve efficient and effective real-time
optimization and data assimilation in the geothermal reservoir production
process.

  Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs)",,,,,"eess.SP cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the most important technical challenges when designing a Cognitive
Radio Networks (CRNs) is spectrum sensing, which has the responsibility of
recognizing the presence or absence of the primary users in the frequency
bands. A common technique used for spectrum sensing is double energy detection
since it can operate without any prior information regarding the
characteristics of the primary user signals. A double threshold energy
detection algorithm is based on the use of two thresholds, to check the energy
of the received signals and decided whether the spectrum is occupied or not.
Furthermore, thresholds play a key role in the energy detection algorithm, by
considering the stochastic features of noise in this model, as a result
calculating the optimal threshold is a crucial task. In this paper, the
Bi-Section algorithm was used to detect the optimum energy level in the fuzzy
region which is an area between the low and high energy threshold. For this
purpose, the decision threshold was determined by the use of the Bisection
function for cognitive users. Numerical simulations show that the proposed
method achieves better detection performance than the conventional
double-threshold energy-sensing schemes. Moreover, the presented technique has
advantages such as increasing the probability of detection of primary users and
decreasing the probability of Collison between primary and secondary users.
