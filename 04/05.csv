walk into a cathedral, the reverberations as much as appearance inform us of
the sanctuary's wide open space. Similarly, as an object moves around us, we
expect the sound emitted to also exhibit this movement. While recent advances
in learned implicit functions have led to increasingly higher quality
representations of the visual world, there have not been commensurate advances
in learning spatial auditory representations. To address this gap, we introduce
Neural Acoustic Fields (NAFs), an implicit representation that captures how
sounds propagate in a physical scene. By modeling acoustic propagation in a
scene as a linear time-invariant system, NAFs learn to continuously map all
emitter and listener location pairs to a neural impulse response function that
can then be applied to arbitrary sounds. We demonstrate that the continuous
nature of NAFs enables us to render spatial acoustics for a listener at an
arbitrary location, and can predict sound propagation at novel locations. We
further show that the representation learned by NAFs can help improve visual
learning with sparse views. Finally, we show that a representation informative
of scene structure emerges during the learning of NAFs.

apparatus such as inverter-based resources (IBRs) have not been made available
and instead only black-box impedance models are available. For tracing the root
causes of poor damping and tuning modes of the system, the sensitivity of the
modes to components and parameters are needed. The so-called critical
admittance-eigenvalue sensitivity based on nodal admittance model has provided
a partial solution but omits meaningful directional information. The
alternative whole-system impedance model yields participation factors of
shunt-connected apparatus with directional information that allows separate
tuning for damping and frequency, yet do not cover series-connected components.
This paper formalises the relationships between the two forms of impedance
models and between the two forms of root-cause analysis. The calculation of
system eigenvalue sensitivity in impedance models is further developed, which
fills the gaps of previous research and establishes a complete theory of
impedance-based root-cause analysis. The theoretical relationships and the
tuning of parameters have been illustrated with a three-node passive network, a
modified IEEE 14-bus network and a modified NETS-NYPS 68-bus network, showing
that tools can be developed for tuning of IBR-rich power systems where only

  version",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For $2\le k\in\mathbb{N}$, consider the following adaptation of the classical
secretary problem. There are $k$ items at each of $n$ linearly ordered ranks.
The $kn$ items are revealed, one item at a time, in a uniformly random order,
to an observer whose objective is to select an item of highest rank. At each
stage the observer only knows the relative ranks of the items that have arrived
thus far, and must either select the current item, in which case the process
terminates, or reject it and continue to the next item. For $M\in\{0,1,\cdots,
kn-1\}$, let $\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)$ denote the strategy whereby one allows the
first $M$ items to pass, and then selects the first later arriving item whose
rank is \it either equal to or greater than\rm\ the highest rank of the first
$M$ items (if such an item exists). Let $W_{\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)}$ denote the
event that one selects an item of highest rank using strategy
$\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)$ and let
  $P_{n,k}(W_{\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)})$ denote the corresponding probability. We
obtain a formula for $P_{n,k}(W_{\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)})$, and for
$\lim_{n\to\infty}P_{n,k}(W_{\mathcal{S}(n,k;M_n)})$, when $M_n\sim ckn$, with
$c\in(0,1)$. In the classical secretary problem, the asymptotically optimal
strategy yields a probability of success of $\frac1e\approx 0.368$. For $k=2$,
the asymptotically optimal strategy yields yields a probability of success of
about 0.701. For $k=3$, the optimal probability is above 0.85, for $k=7$, that
probability exceeds 0.99, and for $k\ge12$, it is 1.000 to three decimal
places. In the problem with multiple items at each rank, there is an additional
measure of efficiency of a strategy besides the probability of selecting an
item of highest rank; namely how quickly one selects an item of highest rank.
We give a rather complete picture of this efficiency.

well one can do in comparison with the rate-distortion function, which
describes the known theoretical limits of lossy compression. Motivated by the
empirical success of deep neural network (DNN) compressors on large, real-world
data, we investigate methods to estimate the rate-distortion function on such
data, which would allow comparison of DNN compressors with optimality. While
one could use the empirical distribution of the data and apply the
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, this approach presents several computational
challenges and inaccuracies when the datasets are large and high-dimensional,
such as the case of modern image datasets. Instead, we re-formulate the
rate-distortion objective, and solve the resulting functional optimization
problem using neural networks. We apply the resulting rate-distortion
estimator, called NERD, on popular image datasets, and provide evidence that
NERD can accurately estimate the rate-distortion function. Using our estimate,
we show that the rate-distortion achievable by DNN compressors are within
several bits of the rate-distortion function for real-world datasets.
Additionally, NERD provides access to the rate-distortion achieving channel, as
well as samples from its output marginal. Therefore, using recent results in
reverse channel coding, we describe how NERD can be used to construct an
operational one-shot lossy compression scheme with guarantees on the achievable
rate and distortion. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance
with DNN compressors.

development. Metaverse applications may help with this task and can make many
industries more interesting, more efficient, and provide a better user

inevitably requires the support of various artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graph (KG),
computer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML), etc. However, existing
metaverse application development lacks a lightweight AI technology framework.
This paper proposes a flexible metaverse AI technology framework metaAID that
aims to support language and semantic technologies in the development of
digital twins and virtual humans. The second challenge is that the development
process of metaverse applications involves both technical development tasks and
manual editing work, and often becomes a heavyweight multi-team collaboration
project, not to mention the development of metaverse applications in multiple
industries. Our framework summarizes common AI technologies and application
development templates with common functional modules and interfaces. Based on
this framework, we have designed 5 applications for 3 industries around the
expansion of domestic demand and economic internal circulation. Experimental
results show that our framework can support AI technologies when developing

$\beta$-$\gamma$-$p$ decay mode, the second such identification in the $f

determining the $^{57}$Zn mass via the isobaric multiplet mass equation.
Previously, it was uncertain as to whether the rp-process flow could bypass the
textbook waiting point $^{56}$Ni for astrophysical conditions relevant to
Type-I X-ray bursts. Our results definitively establish the existence of the
$^{56}$Ni bypass, with 14-17% of the $rp$-process flow taking this route.

frontiers of searches for new physics particles. In particular, due to higher
energy and luminosity than at the LHC, at FCC-hh there would be produced around
$\simeq\!30$ times larger amount of $B$ mesons and $\simeq 120$ times of $W$
bosons, which then may decay into feebly interacting particles. In this paper
we demonstrate the potential of FCC-hh by studying its sensitivity to heavy

of a displaced decay volume embedded in the planned infrastructure of FCC-hh.
We demonstrate that FCC-hh may substantially improve the reach of the parameter

quark-antiquark pair with gluons from the other nucleus forming a short-lived
vector meson (e.g. ${\rho^0}$). In this experiment, the polarization was
utilized in diffractive photoproduction to observe a unique spin interference
pattern in the angular distribution of ${\rho^0\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-}$ decays.
The observed interference is a result of an overlap of two wave functions at a
distance an order of magnitude larger than the ${\rho^0}$ travel distance
within its lifetime. The strong-interaction nuclear radii were extracted from
these diffractive interactions, and found to be $6.53\pm 0.06$ fm ($^{197} {\rm

heterogeneous and dynamic assets, processes and data, resulting in a need to
continuously adapt the learning algorithm accordingly. Industrial transfer
learning offers to lower the effort of such adaptation by allowing the
utilization of previously acquired knowledge in solving new (variants of)
tasks. Being data-driven methods, the development of industrial transfer
learning algorithms naturally requires appropriate datasets for training.
However, open-source datasets suitable for transfer learning training, i.e.
spanning different assets, processes and data (variants), are rare. With the
Stuttgart Open Relay Degradation Dataset (SOReDD) we want to offer such a
dataset. It provides data on the degradation of different electromechanical
relays under different operating conditions, allowing for a large number of
different transfer scenarios. Although such relays themselves are usually
inexpensive standard components, their failure often leads to the failure of a
machine as a whole due to their role as the central power switching element of
a machine. The main cost factor in the event of a relay defect is therefore not
the relay itself, but the reduced machine availability. It is therefore
desirable to predict relay degradation as accurately as possible for specific
applications in order to be able to replace relays in good time and avoid
unplanned machine downtimes. Nevertheless, data-driven failure prediction for
electromechanical relays faces the challenge that relay degradation behavior is
highly dependent on the operating conditions, high-resolution measurement data
on relay degradation behavior is only collected in rare cases, and such data
can then only cover a fraction of the possible operating environments. Relays
are thus representative of many other central standard components in automation
technology.

proteins are interlinked at far from equilibrium, the thermodynamic cost and
hence precision is greatly enhanced as compared to single species switching.
This implies that at far from equilibrium, the proteins tries to optimise the
precision of the performance of their biomolecular processes by forming
interlinks in the cascade. Again,our results imply that the interlinked cascade
(or oscillator) can achieve a range of tunable rate constants (or frequencies)

ion-specific nanoscale surface forces can determine large scale cohesive,
swelling and shrinkage behaviors of soil and sediments. We have used a
semi-atomistic computational approach and examined sodium, calcium and aluminum
counterions confined with water between charged surfaces representative of clay
materials, to show that ion-water structuring in nanoscale confinement is at
the origin of surface forces between clay particles which are intrinsically
ion-specific. When charged surfaces strongly confine ions and water, the
amplitude and oscillations of the net pressure naturally emerge from the
interplay of electrostatics and steric effects, which can not be captured by
existing theories. Increasing confinement and surface charge densities promote
ion-water structures that increasingly deviate from the ions' bulk hydration
shells, being strongly anisotropic and persistent, and self-organizing into
optimized, nearly solid-like assemblies where hardly any free water is left. In
these conditions, strongly attractive interactions can prevail between charged
surfaces, due to the dramatically reduced dielectric screening of water and the
highly organized water-ion structures. By unravelling the ion-specific nature
of these nanoscale interactions, we provide evidence that ion-specific
solvation structures determined by confinement are at the origin of ion
specificity in clays and potentially a broader range of confined aqueous

output predictions of the model are evaluated against a set of reference
summaries. The input is code not seen by the model, and the prediction is
compared to a reference. The means by which a prediction is compared to a
reference is essentially word overlap, calculated via a metric such as BLEU or
ROUGE. The problem with using word overlap is that not all words in a sentence
have the same importance, and many words have synonyms. The result is that
calculated similarity may not match the perceived similarity by human readers.

stress values of ~1.5 GPa, crack-initiation KJIc toughnesses were found to be

and CrCoNi, with the latter displaying a crack-growth toughness Kss exceeding
540 MPa(square-root)m after 2.25 mm of stable cracking, which to our knowledge
is the highest such value ever reported. Characterization of the crack-tip
regions in CrCoNi by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy
reveal deformation structures at 20 K that are quite distinct from those at
higher temperatures and involve heterogeneous nucleation, but restricted
growth, of stacking faults and fine nano-twins, together with transformation to
the hexagonal closed-packed phase. The coherent interfaces of these features
can promote both the arrest and transmission of dislocations to generate
respectively strength and ductility which strongly contributes to sustained
strain hardening. Indeed, we believe that these nominally single-phase,
concentrated solid-solution alloys develop their fracture resistance through a
progressive synergy of deformation mechanisms, including dislocation glide,
stacking-fault formation, nano-twinning and eventually in situ phase
transformation, all of which serve to extend continuous strain hardening which
simultaneously elevates strength and ductility (by delaying plastic
instability), leading to truly exceptional resistance to fracture.

from the moir\'e exchange coupling-induced spin frustrations. Exploring the
twist angle dependence, we demonstrated that both features are present in tDB
CrI$_3$ with twist angles from 0.5$^o$ to 5$^o$, but are most prominent in the

of analytic mappings and the maximum operator is proved. The lemma shows that
the set of $\delta$-stationary points near an isolated local minimum point
$x^*$ is shrinking to $x^*$ as $\delta\to 0$. It is a natural extension of the
version for strongly convex $C^1$ functions. However, the correctness of the
lemma is subtle. Analytic mappings are necessary for the lemma in the sense
that replacing it with differentiable or $C^\infty$ mappings makes the lemma
false. The proof is based on stratification theorems of semi-analytic sets by
{\L}ojasiewicz. An extension of this proof presents a geometric
characterization of the set of stationary points of $f$. Finally, a notion of
stability on stationary points, called convergence stability, is proposed. It
asks, under small numerical errors, whether a reasonable convergent
optimization method started near a stationary point should eventually converge
to the same stationary point. The concept of convergence stability becomes
nontrivial qualitatively only when the objective function is both nonsmooth and
nonconvex. Via the convergence lemma, an intuitive equivalent condition for
convergence stability of $f$ is proved. These results together provide a new
geometric perspective to study the problem of ""where-to-converge"" in nonsmooth
nonconvex optimization.

a broad class of non-linear interacting models. We find that a new term in the
mutual information appears, quantifying the interplay between non-linear

destructive information interference. Furthermore, we show that a higher mutual
information emerges in out-of-equilibrium environments with respect to an

continuously varying environments. We find that environmental changes can be
mapped exactly into an effective spatially-varying diffusion coefficient,
shedding light on modeling and information structure of biophysical systems in

while the CIB maps are made from \planck\, sky maps. We measure the
cross-correlation in harmonic space with a significance of 43$\sigma$. We model
the cross-correlation with a halo model, which links CIB anisotropies to star
formation rates (SFR) and galaxy abundance. We assume that SFR has a lognormal
dependence on halo mass, while galaxy abundance follows the halo occupation
distribution (HOD) model. The cross-correlations give a best-fit maximum star
formation efficiency of $\eta_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.41^{+0.09}_{-0.14}$ at a halo
mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{peak}}/M_{\odot})= {12.14\pm 0.36}$. The derived
star formation rate density (SFRD) is well constrained up to $z\sim 1.5$. The
constraining power at high redshift is mainly limited by the KiDS survey depth.
A combination with external SFRD measurements from previous studies gives
$\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{peak}}/M_{\odot})=12.42^{+0.35}_{-0.19}$. This tightens
the SFRD constraint up to $z=4$, yielding a peak SFRD of

$z=1.74^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$, corresponding to a lookback time of
$10.05^{+0.12}_{-0.03}$ Gyr. Both constraints are consistent, and the derived
SFRD agrees with previous studies and simulations. Additionally, we estimate
the galaxy bias $b$ of KiDS galaxies from the constrained HOD parameters and
yield an increasing bias from $b=1.1_{-0.31}^{+0.17}$ at $z=0$ to
$b=1.96_{-0.64}^{+0.18}$ at $z=1.5$. Finally, we provide a forecast for future
galaxy surveys and conclude that, due to their considerable depth, future
surveys will yield a much tighter constraint on the evolution of the SFRD.

However, such solvers suffer a substantial disconnect between their theoretical
rates and actual efficiency in practice. Fortunately, these solvers are quite
flexible and can be adapted to specific problems and computing environments to
ensure high efficiency in practice, even at the cost of lower effectiveness
(i.e., having a slower theoretical rate of convergence). While highly efficient
adapted solvers can be readily designed by application experts, will such
solvers still converge and at what rate? To answer this, we distill three
general criteria for randomized adaptive solvers, which, as we show, will
guarantee a worst-case exponential rate of convergence of the solver applied to
consistent and inconsistent linear systems irrespective of whether such systems
are over-determined, under-determined or rank-deficient. As a result, we enable

Alternating Direction Inexact Newton method (ALADIN) and its application to
distributed model predictive control (MPC). The focus is - for simplicity of
presentation - on convex quadratic programming (QP) formulations of MPC. It is
explained how ALADIN can be used to synthesize sparse QP solvers for
large-scale linear-quadratic optimal control by combining ideas from augmented
Lagrangian methods, sequential quadratic programming, as well as barrier or
interior point methods. The highlight of this tutorial is a real-time ALADIN
variant that can be implemented with a few lines of code yet arriving at a
sparse QP solver that can compete with mature open-source and commercial QP
solvers in terms of both run-time as well as numerical accuracy. It is
discussed why this observation could have far reaching consequences on the
future of algorithm and software development in the field of large-scale
optimization and MPC.

the $SU(2)$ subgroups of $N_c=3$. By fixing a particular shape for the scalar
potential, the resulting vector potentials and the corresponding color-charges
sources are found. By adopting the spherical coordinate system, it is shown
that spherically symmetric solutions, only dependent on the radial coordinate,
are only possible for the Abelian limit, otherwise, there must have
angle-dependent component(s). The following solutions for the scalar potential
are investigated: the Coulomb potential and a non-spherically symmetric
generalization, a linear potential $A_0 (\vec{r}) \sim (\kappa r)$, a
Yukawa-type potential $A_0 (\vec{r}) \sim (C e^{-r/r_0}/r)$ and finite spatial
regions in which the scalar potential assumes constant values. The
corresponding chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields, as well as the
color-charge densities, are found to have strong deviations from the spherical
symmetric configurations. We speculate these types of non-spherically symmetric
configurations may contribute (or favor) for the (anisotropic) confinement
mechanism since they should favor color charge-anti-charge (or
three-color-charge) bound states that are intrinsically non spherically
symmetric with (asymmetric) confinement of fluxes. Specific conditions and
relations between the parameters of the solutions are also presented.

and spectrum, respectively, 13 and 20 years after the last observations. Short
period modulations of the supersoft X-ray source (SSS) appear where the
spectrum of the luminous central source was fully visibl (in CAL 83 and V1674
Her) and were absent in YZ Ret and MR Vel, in which the flux originated in
photoionized or shocked plasma, while the white dwarf (WD) was not observable.
We thus suggest that the pulsations occur on, or very close to, the WD surface.
The pulsations of CAL 83 were almost unvaried after 15 years, including an
irregular drift of the $\simeq$67 s period by 2.1 s. Simulations, including
previous XMM-Newton data, indicate actual variations in period length within
hours, rather than an artifact of the variable amplitude of the pulsations.
Large amplitude pulsations with a period of 501.53$\pm$0.30 s were always
detected in V1674 Her, as long as the SSS was observable. This period seems to
be due to rotation of a highly magnetized WD.We cannot confirm the maximum
effective temperature of ($\simeq$145,000 K) previously inferred for this nova,

present two surface zones, one of which does not emit SSS flux.

in chiral variables have been encountered and clarified. In particular, if the
theory is supposed to be invariant under SUSY transformations also on
boundaries, the boundary term has to be the action of a
$\mathrm{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ super Chern-Simons theory, and
particular boundary conditions must be met. Based on this, we propose a way to
calculate an entropy $S$ for surfaces, presumably including black hole
horizons, in the supersymmetric version of loop quantum gravity for the minimal
case $\mathcal{N}=1$. It proceeds in analogy to the non-supersymmetric theory,
by calculating dimensions of quantum state spaces of the super Chern-Simons
theory with punctures, for fixed quantum (super) area of the surface. We find
$S = a_H/4$ for large areas and determine the subleading correction. Due to the
non-compactness of $\mathrm{OSp}(1|2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ and the corresponding
difficulties with the Chern-Simons quantum theory, we use analytic continuation
from the Verlinde formula for a compact real form, $\mathrm{UOSp}(1|2)$, in
analogy to work by Noui et al. This also entails studying some properties of
$\mathrm{OSp}(1|2)_{\mathbb{C}}$ representations that we have not found

However, due to this type of signal's nature, its acquisition, in general, is

adaptive merging has been introduced. The key idea is to create index

result, the database table is indexed partially depending on the query
workload. This paper faces a problem of adaptive merging for phase change
memory (PCM). The most important features of this memory type are: limited
write endurance and high write latency. As a consequence, adaptive merging
should be investigated from the scratch. We solve this problem in two steps.
First, we apply several PCM optimization techniques to the traditional adaptive
merging approach. We prove that the proposed method (eAM) outperforms a
traditional approach by 60%. After that, we invent the framework for adaptive

scalability: the implicit formulation directly maps the input coordinates to
features, which enables synthesis of arbitrary size and is computationally
efficient for 3D shape synthesis. Learning with a periodic encoding scheme
encourages diversity: the network is constrained to model the inner statistics
of the exemplar based on spatial latent codes in a periodic field. Coupled with
continuously designed GAN training procedures, IPFN is shown to synthesize
tileable patterns with smooth transitions and local variations. Last but not
least, thanks to both the adversarial training technique and the encoded
Fourier features, IPFN learns high-frequency functions that produce authentic,
high-quality results. To validate our approach, we present novel experimental
results on various applications in 2D texture synthesis and 3D shape synthesis.

travel at some range of speeds with unbounded acceleration. This setting can
model many systems, such as fixed-wing drones. Unfortunately, planning for such
systems might require evaluating many (local) time-optimal transitions
connecting two close-by configurations, which is computationally expensive.
Existing methods either pre-compute all such transitions in a preprocessing
stage or use heuristics to speed up the search, thus foregoing any guarantees
on solution quality. Our key insight is that computing all the time-optimal
transitions is both~(i)~computationally expensive and~(ii)~unnecessary for many
problem instances. We show that by finding bounded-suboptimal solutions
(solutions whose cost is bounded by $1+\varepsilon$ times the cost of the
optimal solution for any user-provided $\varepsilon$) and not time-optimal
solutions, one can dramatically reduce the number of time-optimal transitions
used. We demonstrate using empirical evaluation that our planning framework can

natural source of rich fractal behavior. Such a study was initiated in
Basu-Ganguly-Hammond, where the difference profile i.e., the difference of
passage times from two fixed points (say $(\pm 1,0)$), was considered. Owing to
geodesic geometry, it turns out that this difference process is almost surely
locally constant. The set of non-constancy is connected to disjointness of
geodesics and inherits remarkable fractal properties. In particular, it has
been established that when only the spatial coordinate is varied, the set of
non-constancy of the difference profile has Hausdorff dimension $1/2$, and
bears a rather strong resemblance to the zero set of Brownian motion. The
arguments crucially rely on a monotonicity property, which is absent when the
temporal structure of the process is probed, necessitating the development of
new methods.
  In this paper, we put forth several new ideas, and show that the set of
non-constancy of the 2D difference profile and the 1D temporal process (when
the spatial coordinate is fixed and the temporal coordinate is varied) have
Hausdorff dimensions $5/3$ and $2/3$ respectively. A particularly crucial
ingredient in our analysis is the novel construction of a local time process
for the geodesic akin to Brownian local time, supported on the ""zero set"" of
the geodesic. Further, we show that the latter has Hausdorff dimension $1/3$ in
contrast to the zero set of Brownian motion which has dimension $1/2.$

  spiking neural networks with short-term plasticity","43 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Bottom-up models of functionally relevant patterns of neural activity provide
an explicit link between neuronal dynamics and computation. A prime example of
functional activity pattern is hippocampal replay, which is critical for memory
consolidation. The switchings between replay events and a low-activity state in
neural recordings suggests metastable neural circuit dynamics. As metastability
has been attributed to noise and/or slow fatigue mechanisms, we propose a
concise mesoscopic model which accounts for both. Crucially, our model is
bottom-up: it is analytically derived from the dynamics of finite-size networks
of Linear-Nonlinear Poisson neurons with short-term synaptic depression. As
such, noise is explicitly linked to spike noise and network size, and fatigue
is explicitly linked to synaptic dynamics. To derive the mesosocpic model, we
first consider a homogeneous spiking neural network and follow the temporal
coarse-graining approach of Gillespie (""chemical Langevin equation""), which can
be naturally interpreted as a stochastic neural mass model. The Langevin
equation is computationally inexpensive to simulate and enables a thorough
study of metastable dynamics in classical setups (population spikes and Up-Down
states dynamics) by means of phase-plane analysis. This stochastic neural mass
model is the basic component of our mesoscopic model for replay. We show that
our model faithfully captures the stochastic nature of individual replayed
trajectories. Moreover, compared to the deterministic Romani-Tsodyks model of
place cell dynamics, it exhibits a higher level of variability in terms of
content, direction and timing of replay events, compatible with biological
evidence and could be functionally desirable. This variability is the product
of a new dynamical regime where metastability emerges from a complex interplay
between finite-size fluctuations and local fatigue.

short-term feature extractor by either freezing the backbone or using a small

of different dietary components is an important problem in nutritional
epidemiology. Since these variables cannot be directly measured, data are
usually collected in the form of 24-hour recalls of the intakes. The problem of
estimating the density of the latent long-term average intakes from their
observed but error contaminated recalls then becomes a problem of multivariate
deconvolution of densities. The underlying densities could potentially vary
with the subjects' demographic characteristics such as sex, ethnicity, age,
etc. The problem of density deconvolution in the presence of associated
precisely measured covariates has, however, never been considered before, not
even in the univariate setting. We present a flexible Bayesian semiparametric
approach to covariate informed multivariate deconvolution. Building on recent
advances in copula deconvolution and conditional tensor factorization
techniques, our proposed method not only allows the joint and the marginal
densities to vary flexibly with the associated predictors but also allows
automatic selection of the most influential predictors. Importantly, the method
also allows the density of interest and the density of the measurement errors
to vary with potentially different sets of predictors. We design Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithms that enable efficient posterior inference, appropriately
accommodating uncertainty in all aspects of our analysis. The empirical
efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated through simulation experiments.
Its practical utility is demonstrated in the afore-described nutritional
epidemiology applications in estimating covariate-adjusted long term intakes of
different dietary components. Supplementary materials include substantive
additional details and R codes are also available online.

states are mainly contributed by the Cu $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals highly
hybridized with the O $2p$ orbitals in the nonmagnetic phase, leading to an
""effective"" single-orbital low-energy model. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the
Cu $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ states is small ($\sim 0.8$ eV), suggesting that electronic
correlations will strongly affect this system. By introducing such electronic
correlations, we found this system is a Mott insulator. Moreover, by
calculating the magnetic exchange interactions ($J_1$, $J_2$ and $J_3$), we
explained the size and sign of the exchange interactions in
Na$_2$Cu$_2$TeO$_6$, in agreement with neutron experiments. In addition, we
constructed a single-orbital Hubbard model for this dimerized chain system,

resolution and channel dimension at each decoder layer, ViS4mer learns complex
long-range spatiotemporal dependencies in a video. Furthermore, ViS4mer is
$2.63\times$ faster and requires $8\times$ less GPU memory than the

  Computational Intelligence (TETCI)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent pandemic emergency raised many challenges regarding the
countermeasures aimed at containing the virus spread, and constraining the
minimum distance between people resulted in one of the most effective
strategies. Thus, the implementation of autonomous systems capable of
monitoring the so-called social distance gained much interest. In this paper,
we aim to address this task leveraging a single RGB frame without additional
depth sensors. In contrast to existing single-image alternatives failing when
ground localization is not available, we rely on single image depth estimation
to perceive the 3D structure of the observed scene and estimate the distance
between people. During the setup phase, a straightforward calibration
procedure, leveraging a scale-aware SLAM algorithm available even on consumer
smartphones, allows us to address the scale ambiguity affecting single image
depth estimation. We validate our approach through indoor and outdoor images
employing a calibrated LiDAR + RGB camera asset. Experimental results highlight
that our proposal enables sufficiently reliable estimation of the
inter-personal distance to monitor social distancing effectively. This fact
confirms that despite its intrinsic ambiguity, if appropriately driven single
image depth estimation can be a viable alternative to other depth perception
techniques, more expensive and not always feasible in practical applications.
Our evaluation also highlights that our framework can run reasonably fast and
comparably to competitors, even on pure CPU systems. Moreover, its practical
deployment on low-power systems is around the corner.

competitive and unbiased emission line survey compared to spectroscopic or
narrowband surveys with fewer filters. The miniJPAS survey covered 1 deg$^2$,
and it used the same photometric system as J-PAS, but the observations were
carried out with the pathfinder J-PAS camera. In this work, we identify and
characterize the sample of emission line galaxies (ELGs) from miniJPAS with a
redshift lower than $0.35$. Using a method based on artificial neural networks,
we detect the ELG population and measure the equivalent width and flux of the
$H\alpha$, $H\beta$, [OIII], and [NII] emission lines. We explore the
ionization mechanism using the diagrams [OIII]/H$\beta$ versus [NII]/H$\alpha$
(BPT) and EW(H$\alpha$) versus [NII]/H$\alpha$ (WHAN). We identify 1787 ELGs
($83$%) from the parent sample (2154 galaxies) in the AEGIS field. For the
galaxies with reliable EW values that can be placed in the WHAN diagram (2000
galaxies in total), we obtained that $72.8 \pm 0.4$%, $17.7 \pm 0.4$% , and
$9.4 \pm 0.2$% are star-forming (SF), active galactic nucleus (Seyfert), and

is derived at three redshift bins: $0 < z \leq 0.15$, $0.15 < z \leq 0.25$, and
$0.25 < z \leq 0.35$, which agrees with previous results that were based on

facilitate incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. This will
pose serious problems for future quantum machine learning applications in
safety and security-critical scenarios. Here, we report the first experimental
demonstration of quantum adversarial learning with programmable superconducting

gauge group is widely-studied. In this Letter, we show that a quantum effect is
important if the Higgs field mixes with another singlet scalar field whose
decay rate is larger than the mass difference between the two mass eigenstates.
This effect may be interpreted as the quantum Zeno effect. In either the
quantum mechanics or the quantum field theory, we show that the resulting
propagating mode is not the eigenstate of the mass matrix, but it is
approximately the eigenstate of the interaction. As a consequence, the
decoupling of the mixing effect happens at the infinity limit of the decay
width of the exotic scalar even if the na\""{i}ve mixing parameter is not small.
With a finite decay width of the exotic scalar, we derive the effective mass of
the propagating mode in the SM sector, its decay rate, and the couplings at the
1-loop level. It turns out that the mixed mass eigenstates can mimic the
discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson. This fuzzy Higgs boson can be obtained in a
simple perturbative renormalizable model. It is consistent with the 125 GeV SM
Higgs boson when the mass difference is smaller than ${\cal O}(0.1)$GeV (${\cal
O}(1)$GeV) for ${\cal O}(1)$ (${\cal O}(0.01)$) mixing. We argue the possible
natural scenario for the tiny mass splitting and the possibility that the upper
bound of the mass difference is larger for a strongly-coupled singlet sector.
To probe the fuzzy Higgs boson scenario, it is difficult to directly produce
the singlet sector particles. Nevertheless, the future Higgs factories may
probe this scenario by precisely measuring the Higgs boson invisible decay rate
and the deviation of the Higgs coupling. Applications of the mechanism are also
mentioned.

Guevara and Mizera (CEGM), form a symmetric hierarchy which is essentially
recursive in nature. In the Generalized Feynman Diagrams framework, $m^{(k)}_n$
becomes an \textit{interpolation} of $n$ copies of $m^{(k-1)}_{n-1}$ which can
be reconstituted from compatible combinatorial data on the facets of the
hypersimplex $\Delta_{k,n}$.
  The interpolation, solved by CEGM generalized amplitudes, is tightly
constrained: the combinatorial data on the $n$ facets of $\Delta_{k,n}$ must
extend into its interior to a particular kind of subdivision that is matroidal
and \textit{regular}: the internal faces of the subdivision should be
projections of the bends of a piecewise linear surface over $\Delta_{k,n}$.
Numerous physical and combinatorial questions have been raised; one of these
was to determine if and how the standard biadjoint scalar amplitude $m^{(2)}_n$
itself exists systematically ""inside"" $m^{(k)}_n$.
  In this paper we find an entire forest of identifications of $m^{(2)}_n$ with
multi-dimensional residues of $m^{(3)}_n$, where the kinematic space for each
$m^{(2)}_n$ maps into a twisted chart in the bulk kinematic space. We find
$n\cdot C^{(2)}_{n-5}$ such identifications, where $C^{(2)}_p$ are the Catalan
numbers. We show that after a suitable one-parameter deformation which we call
a \textit{parallel hard limit}, these residues aggregate to produce $n$
distinct, cyclically permuted copies of a product $m^{(2)}_n \cdot
m^{(2)}_{n-3}$.
  We propose a generalization which would give rise to identifications of
$m^{(2)}_n$ inside $m^{(k)}_n$ for $k\ge 4$, via $(k-2)(n-k-2)$-dimensional
residues. Our proof for $k=3$ uses the CEGM formula for $m^{(3)}_n$; it
predicts a new Minkowski sum realization of the associahedron in terms of
certain positroid polytopes in the second hypersimplex $\Delta_{2,n}$.

quantum matter setups has enabled first attempts at quantum-simulating various
intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics, including those probing
thermalization or its absence in closed quantum systems. In a recent work
[Desaules \textit{et al.} [arXiv:2203.08830], we have shown that quantum
many-body scars -- special low-entropy eigenstates that weakly break ergodicity
in nonintegrable systems -- arise in spin-$S$ quantum link models that converge
to $(1+1)-$D lattice quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) in the
Kogut--Susskind limit $S\to\infty$. In this work, we further demonstrate that
quantum many-body scars exist in a truncated version of the Schwinger model,
and are qualitatively more prominent than their counterparts in spin-$S$
quantum link models. We illustrate this by, among other things, performing a
finite-$S$ scaling analysis that strongly suggests that scarring persists in
the truncated Schwinger model in the limit $S\to\infty$. Although it does not
asymptotically converge to the Schwinger model, the truncated formulation is
relevant to synthetic quantum matter experiments, and also provides fundamental
insight into the nature of quantum many-body scars, their connection to lattice
gauge theories, and the thermalization dynamics of the latter. Our conclusions
can be readily tested in current cold-atom setups.

SGRBs detected in $\gamma$-rays will have a detectable GW counterpart; the
joint detection efficiency approaches $100\%$ considering a network of third

it can be a powerful tool in X-ray binary population synthesis models.
Furthermore we calculate the X-ray (2-10 keV) to optical (V-band) flux ratios

due to the age/metallicity spread and the distribution of its stars in the
$\alpha$-Fe plane. We employ Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) data from the

hypothesis. Adopting a random sampling technique, we contrast the abundances of
10 elements in Terzan 5 stars with those of their bulge field counterparts with
comparable atmospheric parameters, finding that they differ at statistically
significant levels. Abundances between the two groups differ by more than
1$\sigma$ in Ca, Mn, C, O, and Al, and more than 2$\sigma$ in Si and Mg. Terzan
5 stars have lower [$\alpha$/Fe] and higher [Mn/Fe] than their bulge
counterparts. Given those differences, we conclude that Terzan 5 is not the
remnant of a $major$ building block of the bulge. We also estimate the stellar
mass of the Terzan 5 progenitor based on predictions by the Evolution and
Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) suite of cosmological
numerical simulations, concluding that it may have been as low as
$\sim3\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ so that it was likely unable to significantly
influence the mean chemistry of the bulge/inner disk, which is significantly
more massive ($\sim10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). We briefly discuss existing scenarios
for the nature of Terzan 5 and propose an observational test that may help
elucidate its origin.

Lorentz-invariant operators are constructed directly from $X^\mu$. Beyond the
kinetic and mass terms, allowed interactions at the renormalizable level
include $X_\mu X^\mu H^\dagger H$, $(X_\mu X^\mu)^2$, and $X_\mu j^\mu$, where
$j^\mu$ is a global current of the SM or of a hidden sector. We show that all
of these interactions lead to scattering amplitudes that grow with powers of
$\sqrt{s}/m_X$, except for the case of $X_\mu j^\mu$ where $j^\mu$ is a
nonanomalous global current. The latter is well-known when $X$ is identified as
a dark photon coupled to the electromagnetic current, often written
equivalently as kinetic mixing between $X$ and the photon. The power counting
for the energy growth of the scattering amplitudes is facilitated by isolating
the longitudinal enhancement. We examine in detail the interaction with an
anomalous global vector current $X_\mu j_{anom}^\mu$, carefully isolating the
finite contribution to the fermion triangle diagram. We calculate the
longitudinally-enhanced observables $Z \rightarrow X\gamma$ (when $m_X < m_Z$),
$f\bar{f} \rightarrow X \gamma$, and $Z\gamma \to Z\gamma$ when $X$ couples to
the baryon number current. Introducing a fake gauge-invariance by writing
$X^\mu = A^\mu - \partial^\mu \pi/m_X$, the would-be gauge anomaly associated
with $A_\mu j_{anom}^\mu$ is canceled by $j_{anom}^\mu \partial_\mu \pi/m_X$;
this is the four-dimensional Green-Schwarz anomaly-cancellation mechanism at
work. Our analysis suggests there is no free lunch by appealing to
St\""uckelberg for the mass of a vector field: the price paid for avoiding a
dark Higgs sector is replaced by the non-generic set of interactions that the
St\""uckelberg vector field must have to avoid amplitudes that grow with energy.

analogous to a quantum spin liquid as described by Anderson's resonating
valence bond (RVB) picture. In this article, we study the intermediate case of
somewhat large molecules, the C$_{20}$ and C$_{60}$ fullerenes. We build a
minimal description in terms of quantum dimer models, allowing for local
resonance processes and repulsion between proximate $\pi$-bonds. This allows us
to characterize ground-states, e.g., with C$_{60}$ forming a superposition of
5828 dimer covers. Despite the large number of contributing dimer covers, the
ground state shows strong dimer-dimer correlations. Going beyond the ground
state, the full spectrum of C$_{60}$ shows many interesting features. Its
Hilbert space is bipartite, leading to spectral reflection symmetry. It has a
large number of protected zero-energy states. In addition, the spectrum
contains many scar-like states, corresponding to localized
dimer-rearrangement-dynamics. Resonance dynamics in QDMs can manifest in the
behaviour of defects, potentially binding defects via an effective attractive
interaction. To test this notion, we introduce pairs of vacancies at all
possible separations. Resonance energy reaches its lowest value when the
vacancies are closest to one another. This suggests confinement of monomers,
albeit within a finite cluster. We discuss qualitative pictures for

corresponds to LLP decay lengths in the mm to cm range. These decay lengths lie
at the boundary between prompt and displaced signatures at the LHC and can be
comprehensively explored by combining searches for both. To illustrate this
point, we consider a scenario where the LLP decays into a charged lepton and a
(nearly) massless invisible particle. By reinterpreting searches for promptly
decaying sleptons and for displaced leptons at both ATLAS and CMS we can then
directly compare LHC exclusions with cosmological observables. We find that the

Aging (YFA) dataset for analyzing the performance of face recognition systems
over short age-gaps in children. We expand previous work by comparing YFA with
several publicly available cross-age adult datasets to quantify the effects of
short age-gap in adults and children. Our analysis confirms a statistically
significant and matcher independent decaying relationship between the match
scores of ArcFace-Focal, MagFace, and Facenet matchers and the age-gap between
the gallery and probe images in children, even at the short age-gap of 6
months. However, our result indicates that the low verification performance
reported in previous work might be due to the intra-class structure of the
matcher and the lower quality of the samples. Our experiment using YFA and a
state-of-the-art, quality-aware face matcher (MagFace) indicates 98.3% and
94.9% TAR at 0.1% FAR over 6 and 36 Months age-gaps, respectively, suggesting
that face recognition may be feasible for children for age-gaps of up to three

SMEFT operators in the electroweak sector. We derive a set of new correlations

accretion efficiency, jet density and resolution, the cluster self-regulates

efficiencies lead to more intermittent jet powers and enhanced star formation

gaseous filaments, which redistributes angular momentum and leads to more
extended cold gas distributions and isotropic bubble distributions. In
comparison to our fiducial low momentum-density jets, high momentum-density
jets heat less efficiently and enable the formation of a persistent cold-gas
disc perpendicular to the jets that is centrally confined. Cavity luminosities
measured from our simulations generally reflect the cooling luminosities of the
intracluster medium (ICM) and correspond to averaged jet powers that are
relatively insensitive to short periods of low-luminosity jet injection. Cold
gas structures in our MHD simulations with low momentum-density jets generally
show a variety of morphologies ranging from discy to very extended filamentary

rational design of metamaterials with not only complex geometries but also
arbitrary distributions of multiple materials within those geometries. Varying
the spatial distribution of multiple materials gives rise to many interesting
and potentially unique combinations of anisotropic elastic properties. While
the availability of a design approach to cover a large portion of all possible
combinations of elastic properties is interesting in itself, it is even more
important to find the extremely rare designs that lead to highly unusual
combinations of material properties (e.g., double-auxeticity and high elastic
moduli). Here, we used a random distribution of a hard phase and a soft phase
within a regular lattice to study the resulting anisotropic mechanical
properties of the network in general and the abovementioned rare designs in
particular. The primary challenge to take up concerns the huge number of design
parameters and the extreme rarity of such designs. We, therefore, used
computational models and deep learning algorithms to create a mapping from the
space of design parameters to the space of mechanical properties, thereby (i)
reducing the computational time required for evaluating each designand (ii)
making the process of evaluating the different designs highly parallelizable.
Furthermore, we selected ten designs to be fabricated using polyjet
multi-material 3D printing techniques, mechanically tested them, and
characterized their behavior using digital image correlation (DIC, 3 designs)
to validate the accuracy of our computational models. The results of our
simulations show that deep learning-based algorithms can accurately predict the
mechanical properties of the different designs, which match the various
deformation mechanisms observed in the experiments.

can be fixed and continuous or flexible and intermittent. EV user preferences
of charging services depend on many factors (e.g., charging prices, choice of

is a need for a highly flexible EV charging network to support the rapid
adoption of the technology. This study presents a dynamic scheduling scheme for
EV charging facilities considering uncertainties in charging demand, charger
availability, and charging rate. The problem is formulated as a dynamic
programming model that minimizes the travel and waiting costs and charging
expenses while penalizing overcharging attempts. An integrated generalized Nash
equilibrium technique is introduced to solve the problem that incorporates a
Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to efficiently capture the uncertainties and
approximate the value function of the dynamic program. Numerical experiments on
hypothetical and real-world networks confirm the solution quality and
computational efficiency of the proposed methodology. This study will promote
EV adoption and support environmental sustainability by helping users lower the

problems in physics. While most of the effort in the literature is focused on
the UV modifications of quantum theory due to gravity, in this work, we show
that generic infrared (IR) modifications arise when we describe quantum theory
in curved space-time. We explicitly demonstrate that the modifications to the
position-momentum algebra are proportional to the curvature invariants (like
Ricci scalar, Kretschmann scalar). Thus, our results show that infrared effects
in quantum systems do not require any extra assumptions. We study particle
dynamics in an arbitrary curved spacetime by embedding them in a
higher-dimensional flat geometry. Dirac's quantization procedure allows us to
completely capture the dynamics of a particle in 4-dimensional curved spacetime
through the modified position-momentum algebra. We apply the method to a few
spacetimes and show that the corrections due to the space-time curvature are
generic. Furthermore, we compare our results with those derived using extended
uncertainty principles. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for
black holes and entanglement.

transformative for the field of computer vision. Many problems which were
severely limited using classical solutions are now seeing unprecedented
success. The rapid proliferation of deep learning methods has led to a sharp
increase in their use in consumer and embedded applications. One consequence of
consumer and embedded applications is lossy multimedia compression which is
required to engineer the efficient storage and transmission of data in these
real-world scenarios. As such, there has been increased interest in a deep
learning solution for multimedia compression which would allow for higher
compression ratios and increased visual quality.
  The deep learning approach to multimedia compression, so called Learned
Multimedia Compression, involves computing a compressed representation of an
image or video using a deep network for the encoder and the decoder. While
these techniques have enjoyed impressive academic success, their industry
adoption has been essentially non-existent. Classical compression techniques
like JPEG and MPEG are too entrenched in modern computing to be easily
replaced. This dissertation takes an orthogonal approach and leverages deep
learning to improve the compression fidelity of these classical algorithms.
This allows the incredible advances in deep learning to be used for multimedia
compression without threatening the ubiquity of the classical methods.
  The key insight of this work is that methods which are motivated by first
principles, i.e., the underlying engineering decisions that were made when the
compression algorithms were developed, are more effective than general methods.
By encoding prior knowledge into the design of the algorithm, the flexibility,
performance, and/or accuracy are improved at the cost of generality...

A central question is the choice of learning signal in cases of total

we propose a self-supervised objective that requires neither human annotation,
nor assumptions about object dynamics. We show that object permanence can
emerge by optimizing for temporal coherence of memory: we fit a Markov walk
along a space-time graph of memories, where the states in each time step are
non-Markovian features from a sequence encoder. This leads to a memory
representation that stores occluded objects and predicts their motion, to
better localize them. The resulting model outperforms existing approaches on
several datasets of increasing complexity and realism, despite requiring
minimal supervision, and hence being broadly applicable.

observer-source and lens-source distances. Similarly, we show that the

  Our approach is based on mapping repulsive Gibbs point processes to hard-core

based on hard-core models used deterministic graphs, which limited the results
to hard-constraint potentials and box-shaped regions in Euclidean space. We
overcome both limitations by randomization. Specifically, we define a

the hard-core partition function of graphs from this distribution concentrates
around $\Xi_{\mathbb V}(\lambda, \phi)$. We show this by deriving a corollary
of the Efron-Stein inequality, which establishes concentration for a function
$f$ of independent random inputs, given the output of $f$ only exhibits small
relative changes when an input is altered. Our approximation algorithm follows
from approximating the hard-core partition function of a random graph from

for the GES and LMC progenitors, respectively. The progenitors of GES and LMC

Chazelle (SICOMP'09) embeds a set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean
space into optimal $k=O(\varepsilon^{-2} \ln n)$ dimensions, while preserving
all pairwise distances to within a factor $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$. The Fast JL
transform supports computing the embedding of a data point in $O(d \ln d +k
\ln^2 n)$ time, where the $d \ln d$ term comes from multiplication with a $d
\times d$ Hadamard matrix and the $k \ln^2 n$ term comes from multiplication
with a sparse $k \times d$ matrix. Despite the Fast JL transform being more
than a decade old, it is one of the fastest dimensionality reduction techniques
for many tradeoffs between $\varepsilon, d$ and $n$.
  In this work, we give a surprising new analysis of the Fast JL transform,
showing that the $k \ln^2 n$ term in the embedding time can be improved to $(k
\ln^2 n)/\alpha$ for an $\alpha =
\Omega(\min\{\varepsilon^{-1}\ln(1/\varepsilon), \ln n\})$. The improvement
follows by using an even sparser matrix. We also complement our improved
analysis with a lower bound showing that our new analysis is in fact tight.

  for Molecular Biology (ISMB'22)",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Database fingerprinting has been widely used to discourage unauthorized
redistribution of data by providing means to identify the source of data
leakages. However, there is no fingerprinting scheme aiming at achieving
liability guarantees when sharing genomic databases. Thus, we are motivated to
fill in this gap by devising a vanilla fingerprinting scheme specifically for
genomic databases. Moreover, since malicious genomic database recipients may
compromise the embedded fingerprint by launching effective correlation attacks
which leverage the intrinsic correlations among genomic data (e.g., Mendel's
law and linkage disequilibrium), we also augment the vanilla scheme by
developing mitigation techniques to achieve robust fingerprinting of genomic
databases against correlation attacks.
  We first show that correlation attacks against fingerprinting schemes for
genomic databases are very powerful. In particular, the correlation attacks can
distort more than half of the fingerprint bits by causing a small utility loss
(e.g.,database accuracy and consistency of SNP-phenotype associations measured
via p-values). Next, we experimentally show that the correlation attacks can be
effectively mitigated by our proposed mitigation techniques. We validate that
the attacker can hardly compromise a large portion of the fingerprint bits even
if it pays a higher cost in terms of degradation of the database utility. For
example, with around 24% loss in accuracy and 20% loss in the consistency of
SNP-phenotype associations, the attacker can only distort about 30% fingerprint
bits, which is insufficient for it to avoid being accused. We also show that
the proposed mitigation techniques also preserve the utility of the shared
genomic databases.

that are essential to Multi-Party Computation and Zero-Knowledge Proofs based
protocols have emerged. Towards improving the efficiency of such primitives, a
number of new block ciphers and hash functions over $\mathbb{F}_p$ were
proposed. These new primitives also showed that following alternative design
strategies to the classical Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) and Feistel
Networks leads to more efficient cipher and hash function designs over
$\mathbb{F}_p$ specifically for large odd primes $p$.
  In view of these efforts, in this work we build an \emph{algebraic framework}
that allows the systematic exploration of viable and efficient design
strategies for constructing symmetric-key (iterative) permutations over
$\mathbb{F}_p$. We first identify iterative polynomial dynamical systems over
finite fields as the central building block of almost all block cipher design
strategies. We propose a generalized triangular polynomial dynamical system
(GTDS), and based on the GTDS we provide a generic definition of an iterative
(keyed) permutation over $\mathbb{F}_p^n$.
  Our GTDS-based generic definition is able to describe the three most
well-known design strategies, namely SPNs, Feistel networks and Lai--Massey.
Consequently, the block ciphers that are constructed following these design
strategies can also be instantiated from our generic definition. Moreover, we
find that the recently proposed \texttt{Griffin} design, which neither follows
the Feistel nor the SPN design, can be described using the generic GTDS-based
definition. We also show that a new generalized Lai--Massey construction can be
instantiated from the GTDS-based definition.
  We further provide generic analysis of the GTDS including an upper bound on
the differential uniformity and the correlation.

the overwhelming majority of educational settings and contexts. However, it can
take a great deal of time and effort for teachers to mark assessments, and to
provide useful feedback to the students. Furthermore, it also creates a
significant cognitive load on the assessors, especially in ensuring fairness
and equity. Therefore, an alternative approach to marking called comparative
judgement (CJ) has been proposed in the educational space. Inspired by the law
of comparative judgment (LCJ). This pairwise comparison for as many pairs as
possible can then be used to rank all submissions. Studies suggest that CJ is
highly reliable and accurate while making it quick for the teachers.
Alternative studies have questioned this claim suggesting that the process can
increase bias in the results as the same submission is shown many times to an
assessor for increasing reliability. Additionally, studies have also found that
CJ can result in the overall marking process taking longer than a more
traditional method of marking as information about many pairs must be
collected.
  In this paper, we investigate Elo, which has been extensively used in rating
players in zero-sum games such as chess. We experimented on a large-scale
Twitter dataset on the topic of a recent major UK political event (""Brexit"",
the UK's political exit from the European Union) to ask users which tweet they
found funnier between a pair selected from ten tweets. Our analysis of the data
reveals that the Elo rating is statistically significantly similar to the CJ
ranking with a Kendall's tau score of 0.96 and a p-value of 1.5x10^(-5). We
finish with an informed discussion regarding the potential wider application of
this approach to a range of educational contexts.

abundant digital signal processing resources on the same silicon die. Such
devices eliminate the complex PC board interfaces that have long been used to

structural measure such as rank or norm, we show that a single
property/constraint: preserving unit-scale consistency, guarantees the
existence of both a solution and, under relatively weak support assumptions,
uniqueness. The framework and solution algorithms also generalize directly to
tensors of arbitrary dimensions while maintaining computational complexity that
is linear in problem size for fixed dimension d. In the context of recommender
system (RS) applications, we prove that two reasonable properties that should
be expected to hold for any solution to the RS problem are sufficient to permit
uniqueness guarantees to be established within our framework. Key theoretical
contributions include a general unit-consistent tensor-completion framework
with proofs of its properties, e.g., consensus-order and fairness, and
algorithms with optimal runtime and space complexities, e.g., O(1)
term-completion with preprocessing complexity that is linear in the number of
known terms of the matrix/tensor. From a practical perspective, the seamless
ability of the framework to generalize to exploit high-dimensional structural
relationships among key state variables, e.g., user and product attributes,
offers a means for extracting significantly more information than is possible

events are analysed, and the double $J/\psi$ production cross section is
estimated for each of the COMPASS targets. The results are compared to
predictions from single- and double-parton scattering models as well as the
pion intrinsic charm and the tetraquark exotic resonance hypotheses. It is
demonstrated that the single parton scattering production mechanism gives the
dominant contribution that is sufficient to describe the data. An upper limit
on the double intrinsic charm content of pion is evaluated. No significant

protein given its sequence of amino-acids -- has attracted considerable
research effort in biochemistry in recent decades. In this work, we explore the
potential of quantum computing to solve a simplified version of protein
folding. More precisely, we numerically investigate the performance of a
variational quantum algorithm, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA), in sampling low-energy conformations of short peptides. We start by
benchmarking the algorithm on an even simpler problem: sampling self-avoiding
walks, which is a necessary condition for a valid protein conformation.
Motivated by promising results achieved by QAOA on this problem, we then apply
the algorithm to a more complete version of protein folding, including a
simplified physical potential. In this case, based on numerical simulations on
20 qubits, we find less promising results: deep quantum circuits are required
to achieve accurate results, and the performance of QAOA can be matched by
random sampling up to a small overhead. Overall, these results cast serious
doubt on the ability of QAOA to address the protein folding problem in the near
term, even in an extremely simplified setting. We believe that the approach and
conclusions presented in this work could offer valuable methodological insights
on how to systematically evaluate variational quantum optimization algorithms
on real-world problems beyond protein folding.

supermultiplets in AdS$_5\times$S$^5$. We start from an ansatz for a
preamplitude from which we generate the full amplitude under the action of a
specific Casimir operator. The ansatz captures a recent ansatz of Huang and
Yuan and we confirm their result through similar constraints. The form of the
result suggests that all ambiguities are captured by the preamplitude which
determines the result up to tree-level ambiguities only. We identify a class of
four-dimensional `zigzag' integrals which are perfectly adapted to describing
the leading logarithmic discontinuity to all orders. We also observe that a
bonus crossing symmetry of the preamplitude follows from the transformation
properties of the Casimir operator. Combined with the zigzag integrals this
allows us to construct a crossing symmetric function with the correct leading
logarithmic discontinuities in all channels.
  From the two-loop result we extract an explicit expression for the two-loop
correction to the anomalous dimensions of twist-four operators of generic spin
which includes dependence on (alternating) nested harmonic sums up to weight
three. We also revisit the prescription of the bulk-point limit of AdS
amplitudes and show how it recovers the full flat-space amplitude, not just its
discontinuity. With this extended notion of the bulk-point limit we reproduce
the scale-dependent logarithmic threshold terms of type IIB string theory in

problem that ensures the reliability of results. Limited tests in this area do
not have tractable null distributions or asymptotic analysis under
alternatives. Also, the functional predictor is usually assumed to be fully

adaptive model checking test for FLM. It combines regular moment-based and
conditional moment-based tests, and achieves model adaptivity via the dimension
of a residual-based subspace. The advantages of our test are manifold. First,
it has a tractable chi-squared null distribution and higher powers under the
alternatives than its components. Second, asymptotic properties under different
underlying models are developed, including the unvisited local alternatives.
Third, the test statistic is constructed upon finite grid points, which
incorporates the discrete nature of collected data. We develop the desirable
relationship between sample size and number of grid points to maintain the
asymptotic properties. Besides, we provide a data-driven approach to estimate
the dimension leading to model adaptivity, which is promising in sufficient
dimension reduction. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to
demonstrate the advantages the test inherits from its two simple components.

subject to inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on one such challenge
that is particularly important for self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed
to deal with a set of predefined tasks associated with an operational domain;
they have problems to deal with new emerging tasks, such as concept shift in
input data that is used for learning. To tackle this challenge, we present
\textit{lifelong self-adaptation}: a novel approach to self-adaptation that
enhances self-adaptive systems that use ML techniques with a lifelong ML layer.
The lifelong ML layer tracks the running system and its environment, associates
this knowledge with the current tasks, identifies new tasks based on
differentiations, and updates the learning models of the self-adaptive system
accordingly. We present a reusable architecture for lifelong self-adaptation
and apply it to the case of concept drift caused by unforeseen changes of the
input data of a learning model that is used for decision-making in
self-adaptation. We validate lifelong self-adaptation for two types of concept
drift using two cases.

classicalizes the CTQW, i.e. turns it into the analogue classical process. We
show that the dynamics arising from intrinsic decoherence, i.e. dephasing in
the energy basis, do not fully classicalize the walker and partially preserves
quantum features. On the other hand, dephasing in the position basis, as
described by the Haken-Strobl master equation or by the quantum stochastic walk
(QSW) model, asymptotically destroys the quantumness of the walker, making it
equivalent to a classical random walk. We also investigate the speed of the
classicalization process, and observe a faster convergence of the QC-distance
to its asymptotic value for intrinsic decoherence and the QSW models, whereas
in the Haken-Strobl scenario, larger values of the decoherence rate induce
localization of the walker.

grid operators restart generators, re-establish transmission paths, and restore
loads after a blackout event. With a goal of restoring electric service in the
shortest time, the core decisions in restoration planning are to partition the
grid into sub-networks, each of which has an initial power source for
black-start (called sectionalization problem), and then restart all generators
in each network (called generator startup sequencing problem or GSS) as soon as
possible. Due to the complexity of each problem, the sectionalization and GSS
problems are usually solved separately, often resulting in a sub-optimal
solution. Our paper develops models and computational methods to solve the two
problems simultaneously. We first study the computational complexity of the GSS
problem and develop an efficient integer linear programming formulation. We
then integrate the GSS problem with the sectionalization problem and develop an
integer linear programming formulation for the parallel power system
restoration (PPSR) problem to find exact optimal solutions. To solve larger
systems, we then develop bounding approaches that find good upper and lower
bounds efficiently. Finally, to address computational challenges for very large
power grids, we develop a randomized approach to find a high-quality feasible
solution quickly. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed
approaches are able to find good solutions for PPSR in up to 2000-bus systems.

garnering much interest, however, dosimetry calculation techniques remain
relatively simple. PURPOSE: To introduce egs_mird, a new Monte Carlo
application built in EGSnrc which allows users to model full patient tissue and
density (using clinical CT images) and radionuclide distribution (using
clinical PET images) for fast and detailed TRT dose calculation. METHODS: The
novel application egs_mird is introduced, including its structure and variation
reduction approaches. A new egs++ source class egs_internal_source and a
modified version of egs_radionuclide_source are described. The new code is
compared to other MC calculations of S-value kernels, along with
self-validation using the electron Fano test. Full patient prostate 177Lu TRT
cancer treatment simulations are performed using a single set of patient DICOM
CT and [18F]-DCFPyL PET data. RESULTS: Good agreement is found between S-value
kernels calculated using egs_mird and those found in the literature. The Fano
test is satisfied to 0.1%. Patient prostate, rectum, bone marrow, and bladder
dose volume histogram results did not vary significantly when using the
track-length estimator and not modelling electron transport, modelling bone
marrow explicitly (rather than using generic tissue compositions), and reducing
activity to voxels containing partial or full calcifications to half or none,
respectively. Simulations using the track-length estimator can be completed in
under 15 minutes. CONCLUSION: This work shows egs mird to be a reliable MC code
for computing TRT doses as realistically as the patient CT and PET data allow,
supporting the use of egs mird for dose calculations in TRT.

shopping intents and interacted items simultaneously. The learned intents are
coarse-grained and work as prior knowledge for item recommendation. To this
end, we present a coarse-to-fine self-attention framework, namely CaFe, which
explicitly learns coarse-grained and fine-grained sequential dynamics.
Specifically, CaFe first learns intents from coarse-grained sequences which are
dense and hence provide high-quality user intent representations. Then, CaFe
fuses intent representations into item encoder outputs to obtain improved item

invest into a company or not is typically done manually by looking at various
performance indicators of the company and then making a decision often based on

screening of investment opportunities and thus the recommendation of businesses
to invest in. The framework draws on data from several sources to assess the

system can rotate chaotically due to the time-varying gravitational torque from
the central mass. At small orbital eccentricity values, rotation is short-term
orderly and predictable within the commensurate spin-orbit resonances, while at
eccentricity approaching unity, chaos completely takes over. Here, we present
the full 3D rotational equations of motion around all three principle axes for
triaxial minor planets and two independent methods of numerical solution based
on Euler rotations and quaternion algebra. The domains of chaotic rotation are
numerically investigated over the entire range of eccentricity with a
combination of trial integrations of Euler's equations of motion and the
GALI($k$) method. We quantify the dependence of the order--chaos boundaries on
shape by changing a prolateness parameter, and find that the main 1:1
spin-orbit resonance disappears for specific moderately prolate shapes already
at eccentricities as low as 0.3. The island of short-term stability around the
main 1:1 resonance shrinks with increasing eccentricity at a fixed low degree
of prolateness and completely vanishes at approximately 0.8. This island is
also encroached by chaos on longer time scales indicating longer Lyapunov
exponents. Trajectories in the close vicinity of the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance
become chaotic at smaller eccentricities, but separated enclaves of orderly
rotation emerge at eccentricities as high as 0.8. Initial perturbations of
rotational velocity in latitude away from the exact equilibrium result in a
spectrum of free libration, nutation, and polar wander, which is not well
matched by the linearized analysis omitting the inertial terms.

Because of background influence studies, DIRAC explored three subsamples of
$K^+K^-$ pairs, obtained by subtracting -- using time-of-flight (TOF) technique
-- background from initial $Q$ distributions with $K^+K^-$ sample fractions
more than 70\%, 50\% and 30\%. The corresponding pair distributions in $Q$ and
in its longitudinal projection $Q_L$ were analyzed first in a Coulomb model,
which takes into account only Coulomb final state interaction (FSI) and
assuming point-like pair production. This Coulomb model analysis leads to a
$K^+K^-$ yield increase of about four at $Q_L=0.5$ MeV/c compared to 100 MeV/c.
In order to study contributions from strong interaction, a second more
sophisticated model was applied, considering besides Coulomb FSI also strong
FSI via the resonances $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ and a variable distance $r^*$
between the produced $K$ mesons. This analysis was based on three different
parameter sets for the pair production. For the 70\% subsample and with best
parameters, $3680\pm 370$ $K^+K^-$ pairs was found to be compared to $3900\pm
410$ $K^+K^-$ extracted by means of the Coulomb model. Knowing the efficiency
of the TOF cut for background suppression, the total number of detected
$K^+K^-$ pairs was evaluated to be around $40000\pm 10\%$, which agrees with
the result from the 30\% subsample. The $K^+K^-$ pair number in the 50\%
subsample differs from the two other values by about three standard deviations,
confirming -- as discussed in the paper -- that experimental data in this
subsample is less reliable.

attention in the service industries where workers frequently perform multiple
tasks by switching from one task to another. Hall, Leung and Li (Discrete

model which allows a team to continue to work on the primary tasks while
processing the routinely scheduled activities as they occur. The processing
sharing is achieved by allocating a fraction of the processing capacity to
routine jobs and the remaining fraction, which we denote as sharing ratio, to
the primary jobs.
  In this paper, we generalize this model to parallel machines and allow the
fraction of the processing capacity assigned to routine jobs to vary from one
to another. The objectives are minimizing makespan and minimizing the total
completion time. We show that for both objectives, there is no polynomial time
approximation algorithm unless P=NP if the sharing ratios are arbitrary for all
machines. Then we consider the problems where the sharing ratios on some
machines have a constant lower bound. For each objective, we analyze the
performance of the classical scheduling algorithms and their variations and
then develop a polynomial time approximation scheme when the number of machines
is a constant.

plan for a tilt-rotor. The previous gaits analyzed in the tilt-rotor research
are inspired by animals; no theoretical base backs the robustness of these
gaits. This research deduces the gaits by diminishing the effect of the
attitude of the tilt-rotor for the first time. Four-dimensional gait surfaces
are subsequently found, on which the gaits are expected to be robust to the
attitude. These surfaces provide the region where the gait is suggested to be
planned. However, a discontinuous region may hinder the gait plan process while
utilizing the proposal gait surfaces. A Two Color Map Theorem is then
established to guarantee the continuity of each gait designed. The robustness
of the typical gaits obeying the Two Color Map Theorem and on the gait surface
is demonstrated by comparing the singular curve in attitude with the gaits not
on the gait surface. The result shows that the acceptable attitudes enlarge for
the gaits on the gait surface.

deploying advanced driving systems (ADS) or advanced driver-assistance systems
(ADAS) to real life. State-of-the-art methods in predicting pedestrian crossing
intention often rely on multiple streams of information as inputs, each of
which requires massive computational resources and heavy network architectures
to generate. However, such reliance limits the practical application of the
systems. In this paper, driven the the real-world demands of pedestrian
crossing intention prediction models with both high efficiency and accuracy, we
introduce a network with only frames of pedestrians as the input. Every
component in the introduced network is driven by the goal of light weight.
Specifically, we reduce the multi-source input dependency and employ light
neural networks that are tailored for mobile devices. These smaller neural
networks can fit into computer memory and can be transmitted over a computer
network more easily, thus making them more suitable for real-life deployment
and real-time prediction. To compensate the removal of the multi-source input,
we enhance the network effectiveness by adopting a multi-task learning
training, named ""side task learning"", to include multiple auxiliary tasks to
jointly learn the feature extractor for improved robustness. Each head handles
a specific task that potentially shares knowledge with other heads. In the
meantime, the feature extractor is shared across all tasks to ensure the
sharing of basic knowledge across all layers. The light weight but high
efficiency characteristics of our model endow it the potential of being
deployed on vehicle-based systems. Experiments validate that our model
consistently delivers outstanding performances.

They are designed to replace the commonly used parameterizations in likelihood

dynamical cosmologies and dark energy potentials. Thus they are termed
Cosmology and Potential Specific, CPS, templates. A suite of CPS templates are
calculated for a flat quintessence cosmology with a dark energy potential of
the same mathematical form as the Higgs potential. This Higgs inspired, HI,
polynomial potential produces a rich set of evolutions unlike most monomial
potentials. The study produces CPS templates that are analytic functions of the
scale factor. It uses a recently developed beta function formalism that
provides a differential function for the scalar in terms of the scale factor.
This establishes a methodology for easily producing CPS templates for other
dark energy potentials and cosmologies to determine the likelihoods of
dynamical cosmologies relative to Lambda CDM. The study also examines the
evolution of fundamental constants such as the proton to electron mass ratio
and the fine structure constant involving an intersection between particle

TSV technology is advantageous in large detector arrays where TSVs enable close

frustrated by solder balls introduced onto the ASIC surface for flip-chip

successfully demonstrated ATS operation on ASICs originally developed for
CdZnTe detectors on the Nuclear Spectroscopic and Telescope Array (NuSTAR)

pulsed multimode fields in which each wavelength is locked to an individual

waveguide at a tunable group velocity. In this conception, an initially
localized field remains localized along the waveguide. Here, we provide
proof-of-principle experimental confirmation for the existence of this new

which the ULDM particle masses are: free to vary; and fixed. For each of these
analyses, we perform fits assuming the soliton and halo profiles are: summed
together; and matched at a given radius. When we let the particle masses vary,
we find a negligible preference for any particular range of particle masses,
within $10^{-25}\,\text{eV}\leq m\leq10^{-19}\,\text{eV}$, when assuming the
summed models. For the matched models, however, we find that almost all
galaxies prefer particles masses in the range $10^{-23}\,\text{eV}\lesssim
m\lesssim10^{-20}\,\text{eV}$. For both double flavor models we find that most
galaxies prefer approximately equal particle masses. We find that the summed
models give much larger variances with respect to the soliton-halo (SH)
relation than the matched models. When the particle masses are fixed, the
matched models give median and mean soliton and halo values that fall within
the SH relation bounds, for most masses scanned. When the particle masses are

  While fairness has received significant attention recently, e.g., in machine
learning, there is little focus on achieving fairness when dealing with
location data. Due to their characteristics and specific type of processing
algorithms, location data pose important fairness challenges. We introduce the
concept of spatial data fairness to address the specific challenges of location
data and spatial queries. We devise a novel building block to achieve fairness
in the form of fair polynomials. Next, we propose two mechanisms based on fair

common location-based decision-making types: distance-based and zone-based.

ground-based experiments, such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the

spatial anti-bunching through violation of the classical Cauchy-Schwartz

the photon-pair rate is strongly enhanced by 450 times as compared to
unpatterned films due to high-quality-factor metasurface resonances, and the

investigate the thermodynamic properties of a deformed Schwarzschild black hole
(SBH). Our results present a new scenario of black hole evaporation. As a first
step, we described the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, the Hawking
temperature, and the entropy of NC SBH. The non-commutativity removes the
divergence behavior of temperature, and the result shows a difference in the
pole-equator temperature. These corrections also reveal a new fundamental
length at the Planck scale order, $\Theta \approx 2.257 \times 10^{-35}\,m$. In
the last stage of evaporation, the NC correction exposes a remnant entropy
$\hat{S}_0$ of the NC SBH. Then, the description of the heat capacity and the
Gibbs free energy of the deformed black hole shows the effect of the NC gauge
theory on the thermodynamic stability and the phase transitions. Finally, we
investigate the influence of the black hole pressure on the stability and the
phase transition of SBH in NC spacetime. In this study, we found that the NC
parameter plays a similar role to the thermodynamic variables. The results show
a second-order phase transition of NC SBH.

showed high energy resolution. This was achieved by lowering the critical
temperature Tc to 115 mK and the resultant energy resolution was 67 meV full
width at half maximum (FWHM) at 0.8 eV. When Tc was lowered to 115 mK, the
theoretical resolution would scaled up to 30 meV FWHM, considering that the
typical energy resolution of optical TESs is 150 meV and Tc is 300 mK. To
investigate the gap between the theoretical expectation (30 meV) and the
measured value (67 meV), we measured its complex impedance and current noise.
We found excess Johnson noise in the TES and an excess Johnson term M was 1.5

approximately solve this optimization problem. We also present an adaptation of
conformal prediction tools as another approach to construct prediction

than $1/2$ can be constructed with spin-1/2 spinors (Dirac-Weyl spinors) and
scalars, we introduce a map between Weyl fields and Dirac-Weyl fields. We
determine the corresponding Dirac-Weyl spinors in a given empty spacetime.
Regarding them as basic units, other higher spin massless free-field spinors
are then identified. Along this way, we find some hidden fundamental features
related to these fields. In particular, for non-twisting vacuum Petrov type N
solutions, we show that all higher spin massless free-field spinors can be
constructed with one type of Dirac-Weyl spinor and the zeroth copy.
Furthermore, we systematically rebuild the Weyl double copy for non-twisting
vacuum type N and vacuum type D solutions. Moreover, we show that the zeroth
copy not only connects the gravity fields with a single copy but also connects
the degenerate Maxwell fields with the Dirac-Weyl fields in the curved
spacetime, both for type N and type D cases. Besides, we extend the study to
non-twisting vacuum type III solutions. We find a particular Dirac-Weyl scalar
independent of the proposed map and whose square is proportional to the Weyl
scalar. A degenerate Maxwell field and an auxiliary scalar field are then
identified. Both of them play similar roles as the Weyl double copy. The result
further inspires us that there is a deep connection between gravity theory and

the firefighters' movement is restricted so they can only move up to some fixed
distance $d$ per turn rather than being able to move without restriction. We
establish some general properties of this new game in contrast to properties of
the original game, and we investigate specific cases of the distance-restricted

two firefighters are insufficient on the square grid when $d = 2$, and we pose

Metropolis process. More specifically, Jerrum showed that the Metropolis
algorithm cannot find a clique of size $k=\Theta(n^{\alpha}), \alpha \in
(0,1/2)$, which is planted in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,1/2)$,
in polynomial time. Information theoretically it is possible to find such
planted cliques as soon as $k \ge (2+\epsilon) \log n$.
  Since the work of Jerrum, the computational problem of finding a planted
clique in $G(n,1/2)$ was studied extensively and many polynomial time
algorithms were shown to find the planted clique if it is of size $k =
\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, while no polynomial-time algorithm is known to work when
$k=o(\sqrt{n})$. Notably, the first evidence of the problem's algorithmic
hardness is commonly attributed to the result of Jerrum from 1992.
  In this paper we revisit the original Metropolis algorithm suggested by
Jerrum. Interestingly, we find that the Metropolis algorithm actually fails to
recover a planted clique of size $k=\Theta(n^{\alpha})$ for any constant $0
\leq \alpha < 1$.
  Moreover, we strengthen Jerrum's results in a number of other ways including:
Like many results in the MCMC literature, the result of Jerrum shows that there
exists a starting state (which may depend on the instance) for which the
Metropolis algorithm fails. For a wide range of temperatures, we show that the
algorithm fails when started at the most natural initial state, which is the
empty clique. This answers an open problem stated in Jerrum (1992). We also
show that the simulated tempering version of the Metropolis algorithm, a more
sophisticated temperature-exchange variant of it, also fails at the same regime
of parameters.
  Finally, our results confirm recent predictions by Gamarnik and Zadik (2019)
and Angelini, Fachin, de Feo (2021).

two-dimensional plane-Poiseuille flow are studied numerically and
theoretically. When the Reynolds number ($Re$) is less than a critical value
$Re_c$, the disturbance kinetic energy $E_k$ of LWP decreases monotonically
with time and experiences three decay periods, i.e. the initial and the final
steep descent periods, and the middle plateau period. Higher initial $E_k$ of a
decaying LWP corresponds to longer lifetime. According to the simulations, the
lifetime scales as $(Re_c-Re)^{-1/2}$, indicating a divergence of lifetime as
$Re$ approaches $Re_c$, a phenomenon known as ""critical slowing-down"". By
proposing a pattern preservation approximation, i.e. the integral kinematic
properties (e.g. the disturbance enstrophy) of an evolving LWP are independent
of $Re$ and single valued functions of $E_k$, the disturbance kinetic energy
equation can be transformed into the classical differential equation for
saddle-node bifurcation, by which the lifetimes of decaying LWPs can be
derived, supporting the $-1/2$ scaling law. Furthermore, by applying the
pattern preservation approximation and the integral kinematic properties
obtained as $Re<Re_c$, the Reynolds number and the corresponding $E_k$ of the
whole lower branch, the turning point, and the upper-branch LWPs with
$E_k<0.15$ are predicted successfully with the disturbance kinetic energy
equation, indicating that the pattern preservation is an intrinsic feature of
this localized transitional structure.

In addition, we also find that these phases also maintain a strong resistance

vehicle is a challenging task. Generative imitation learning is one possible
approach for automating policy-building by leveraging both real-world and
simulated decisions. Previous work that applies generative imitation learning
to autonomous driving policies focuses on learning a low-level controller for
simple settings. However, to scale to complex settings, many autonomous driving
systems combine fixed, safe, optimization-based low-level controllers with
high-level decision-making logic that selects the appropriate task and
associated controller. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap in
complexity by employing Safety-Aware Hierarchical Adversarial Imitation
Learning (SHAIL), a method for learning a high-level policy that selects from a
set of low-level controller instances in a way that imitates low-level driving
data on-policy. We introduce an urban roundabout simulator that controls
non-ego vehicles using real data from the Interaction dataset. We then
demonstrate empirically that even with simple controller options, our approach
can produce better behavior than previous approaches in driver imitation that
have difficulty scaling to complex environments. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/sisl/InteractionImitation.

Google maps, Waze, Garmin) are not designed to personalize their low-level

personalized navigation systems that adapt to a variety of driving styles, we
propose an online no-regret model-based RL method that quickly conforms to the
dynamics of the current user. As the user interacts with it, the navigation
system quickly builds a user-specific model, from which navigation commands are
optimized using model predictive control. By personalizing the policy in this

progress towards a QD laser diode (QLD) has been fast nonradiative Auger decay
of optical-gain-active multicarrier states. Recently, this problem has been
resolved by employing continuously graded QDs (cg-QDs) wherein Auger
recombination is strongly suppressed. The use of these structures allowed for
demonstrations of optical gain with electrical pumping and optically-excited
lasing in multilayered LED-like devices. Here we report on achieving the next
critical milestone towards a QLD, which is the demonstration of optically
excited amplified spontaneous emission from a fully functional high-current
density electroluminescent device. This advance has become possible due to
excellent optical gain properties of novel 'compact' cg-QDs and a new LED
architecture, which allows for concerted optimization of its optical and
electrical properties. The results of this work strongly suggest the
feasibility of the final step towards a functional QLD, which is the
demonstration of lasing with electrical pumping.

to the primal variables and the inputs correspond to the dual ones. We provide
a detailed suite of conditions based on constraint qualification under which

continuous-time methods for optimization in a simple example illustrate the
advantages of the safe gradient flow.

distributions in a discrete space derived from a pixel-level pre-clustered

work, we present a novel framework for pluralistic image completion that can
achieve both high quality and diversity at much faster inference speed. The
core of our design lies in a simple yet effective code sharing mechanism that
leads to a very compact yet expressive image representation in a discrete
latent domain. The compactness and the richness of the representation further
facilitate the subsequent deployment of a transformer to effectively learn how
to composite and complete a masked image at the discrete code domain. Based on
the global context well-captured by the transformer and the available visual
regions, we are able to sample all tokens simultaneously, which is completely
different from the prevailing autoregressive approach of iGPT-based works, and
leads to more than 100$\times$ faster inference speed. Experiments show that
our framework is able to learn semantically-rich discrete codes efficiently and
robustly, resulting in much better image reconstruction quality. Our diverse
image completion framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art both
quantitatively and qualitatively on multiple benchmark datasets.

Earth radii separates compact rocky Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with lower
density. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the radius valley.
Characterizing the radius valley morphology and its correlation to stellar
properties will provide crucial observation constraints on its origin mechanism
and deepen the understanding of planet formation and evolution. In this paper,
the third part of the Planets Across the Space and Time (PAST) series, using
the LAMOST-Gaia-Kepler catalog, we perform a systematical investigation into
how the radius valley morphology varies in the Galactic context, i.e.,
thin/thick galactic disks, stellar age and metallicity abundance ([Fe/H] and
[alpha/Fe]). We find that (1) The valley becomes more prominent with the
increase of both age and [Fe/H]. (2) The number ratio of super-Earths to
sub-Neptunes monotonically increases with age but decreases with [Fe/H] and
[alpha/Fe]. (3) The average radius of planets above the valley (2.1-6 Earth
radii) decreases with age but increases with [Fe/H]. (4) In contrast, the
average radius of planets below the valley (R < 1.7 Earth radii) is broadly
independent on age and metallicity. Our results demonstrate that the valley
morphology as well as the whole planetary radius distribution evolves on a long
timescale of giga-years, and metallicities (not only Fe but also other metal
elements, e.g., Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) play important roles in planet formation and in
the long term planetary evolution.

based deep network) has prevailed among many vision tasks. This work explores a
new intriguing direction: training a stylized implicit representation, using a
generalized approach that can apply to various 2D and 3D scenarios. We conduct
a pilot study on a variety of implicit functions, including 2D coordinate-based
representation, neural radiance field, and signed distance function. Our
solution is a Unified Implicit Neural Stylization framework, dubbed INS. In
contrary to vanilla implicit representation, INS decouples the ordinary
implicit function into a style implicit module and a content implicit module,
in order to separately encode the representations from the style image and
input scenes. An amalgamation module is then applied to aggregate these
information and synthesize the stylized output. To regularize the geometry in
3D scenes, we propose a novel self-distillation geometry consistency loss which
preserves the geometry fidelity of the stylized scenes. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on multiple task settings, including novel view
synthesis of complex scenes, stylization for implicit surfaces, and fitting
images using MLPs. We further demonstrate that the learned representation is
continuous not only spatially but also style-wise, leading to effortlessly
interpolating between different styles and generating images with new mixed
styles. Please refer to the video on our project page for more view synthesis

liquids and the atomic structural characteristics and dynamical properties were
systematically investigated and compared for understanding the underlying

simulated monatomic liquids exhibit similar structural characteristics and
temperature evolution. However, the degree varies significantly in different
liquids. It is found that the atomic structures in liquid Cu, Ta, and Fe are
quite similar. However, liquid Ta exhibits more ordered and more densely packed
structure features, with more populated icosahedral-like atomic ordering and
five-fold HA indexes, less Voronoi entropy, and more regular tetrahedral
configurations. Moreover, the increase of crystal-like clusters in liquid Ta
slows down with decreasing temperature, and the icosahedral-like clusters
increase more quickly, exceeding crystal-like ones, in contrast to other
liquids. On the contrary, the atomic structures of liquid Al and Zr are more
similar, much more disordered and more loosely packed. Furthermore, liquid Ta
exhibits more slow and heterogeneous dynamics, which could be facilitated by
the particular atomic structures of liquid Ta. Both the atomic structure and
dynamics features in liquid Ta favor its glass formation. Our findings provide
comprehensive structural and dynamical information for better understanding GFA

unexplored but relativistically generated 2D quantum spin Hall Hamiltonian, but
without using spin-orbit coupling. A long cylindrical solenoid lies normally
through the inner radius of a 2D metallic Corbino disk. The current $I_S$
surrounding the solenoid produces an azimuthal magnetic vector potential but no
magnetic field in the disk. In addition, a radial electric field is generated
across the disk by imposing either (a) a potential difference $\Delta v$ or (b)
a radial charge current ${\bm I}$ across its inner and outer radii. Combined
changes in $I_S$ and in either $\Delta v$ or ${\bm I}$ generate spontaneously
quantized azimuthal charge and spin currents. The experiment is designed to
measure these quantized azimuthal charge and spin currents in the disk
consistently. The quantum Hamiltonians for experiments (a) and (b) are both
solved exactly. A method to control the Joule heating is presented, which could
potentially allow the quantum spin Hall measurements to be made at room

shift enables critical and time-sensitive analytic intelligence to be acquired
in a timely manner on-board the satellite itself. However, at present, the
on-board processing of multi-spectral satellite images is limited to
classification and segmentation tasks. Extending this processing to its next

panoptic segmentation of multi-spectral satellite images. Panoptic segmentation
offers major economic and environmental insights, ranging from yield estimation
from agricultural lands to intelligence for complex military applications.
Nevertheless, the on-board intelligence extraction raises several challenges
due to the loss of temporal observations and the need to generate predictions
from a single image sample. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal
teacher network based on a cross-modality attention-based fusion strategy to
improve the segmentation accuracy by exploiting data from multiple modes. We
also propose an online knowledge distillation framework to transfer the
knowledge learned by this multi-modal teacher network to a uni-modal student
which receives only a single frame input, and is more appropriate for an
on-board environment. We benchmark our approach against existing
state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation models using the PASTIS multi-spectral

been a key problem in computational ocean acoustics. Traditionally, this
solution is usually obtained by directly solving the acoustic Helmholtz
equation using a finite difference or finite element algorithm. Solving the
three-dimensional Helmholtz equation directly is computationally expensive. For
quasi-three-dimensional problems, the Helmholtz equation can be processed by
the integral transformation approach, which can greatly reduce the
computational cost. In this paper, a numerical algorithm for a
quasi-three-dimensional sound field that combines an integral transformation
technique, stepwise coupled modes and a spectral method is designed. The
quasi-three-dimensional problem is transformed into a two-dimensional problem
using an integral transformation strategy. A stepwise approximation is then
used to discretize the range dependence of the two-dimensional problem; this
approximation is essentially a physical discretization that further reduces the
range-dependent two-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional problem. Finally,
the Chebyshev--Tau spectral method is employed to accurately solve the
one-dimensional problem. We provide the corresponding numerical program SPEC3D

data scarcity. In this work, we propose a prompting-based approach to generate
labelled training data for intent classification with off-the-shelf language
models (LMs) such as GPT-3. An advantage of this method is that no
task-specific LM-fine-tuning for data generation is required; hence the method
requires no hyper-parameter tuning and is applicable even when the available
training data is very scarce. We evaluate the proposed method in a few-shot
setting on four diverse intent classification tasks. We find that GPT-generated
data significantly boosts the performance of intent classifiers when intents in
consideration are sufficiently distinct from each other. In tasks with
semantically close intents, we observe that the generated data is less helpful.
Our analysis shows that this is because GPT often generates utterances that
belong to a closely-related intent instead of the desired one. We present
preliminary evidence that a prompting-based GPT classifier could be helpful in
filtering the generated data to enhance its quality.

recent advances in realistic image and video synthesis techniques. There have
been several attempts at combating Deepfakes using machine learning
classifiers. However, such classifiers do not generalize well to black-box
image synthesis techniques and have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a deep learning based
semi-fragile watermarking technique that allows media authentication by
verifying an invisible secret message embedded in the image pixels. Instead of
identifying and detecting fake media using visual artifacts, we propose to
proactively embed a semi-fragile watermark into a real image so that we can
prove its authenticity when needed. Our watermarking framework is designed to
be fragile to facial manipulations or tampering while being robust to benign
image-processing operations such as image compression, scaling, saturation,
contrast adjustments etc. This allows images shared over the internet to retain
the verifiable watermark as long as face-swapping or any other Deepfake
modification technique is not applied. We demonstrate that FaceSigns can embed
a 128 bit secret as an imperceptible image watermark that can be recovered with
a high bit recovery accuracy at several compression levels, while being
non-recoverable when unseen Deepfake manipulations are applied. For a set of
unseen benign and Deepfake manipulations studied in our work, FaceSigns can
reliably detect manipulated content with an AUC score of 0.996 which is
significantly higher than prior image watermarking and steganography
techniques.

observed by the LHCb Collaboration at the invariant mass spectrum of
$\Lambda_b^0\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$, which aroused a hot discussion about their inner
structures. The $\Lambda_b(6146)$ and $\Lambda_b(6152)$ might still be
molecular states because their masses are close to threshold of a $\bar{B}$
meson and a nucleon. In this work, we perform a systematical investigation of
possible heavy baryonic molecular states from the $\bar{B}N$ interaction. Since
the $\bar{B}N$ channel strongly couples to the $\bar{B}^{*}N$ channel, the
possible $\bar{B}N-\bar{B}^{*}N$ bound states are also studied. The interaction
of the system considered is described by the $t$-channel $\sigma$, $\pi$,
$\eta$ ,$\omega$, and $\rho$ mesons exchanges. By solving the non-relativistic
Schr\""{o}dinger equation with the obtained one-boson-exchange potentials, the
$\bar{B}^{(*)}N$ bound states with different quantum numbers are searched. The
calculation suggests that recently observed $\Lambda_b(6146)$ can be assigned
as a $P$-wave $\bar{B}N$ molecular state with spin parity $J^P=3/2^{+}$ or a
$\bar{B}N-\bar{B}^{*}N$ bound state. However, assignment of $\Lambda_b(6152)$
as an $F$-wave $\bar{B}N$ molecular is disfavored. The $\Lambda_b(6152)$ can be
explained as meson-baryon molecular state with a small $\bar{B}N$ component.
The calculation also predict the existence of two $S$-wave
$\bar{B}N-\bar{B}^{*}N$ bound states that can be related to the experimentally
observed $\Lambda_b(5912)$ and $\Lambda_b(5920)$.

approximately-revenue-optimal multi-item mechanisms, namely the buy-many
constraint. Under this constraint, prices for different allocations made by the
mechanism must be subadditive implying that the price of a bundle cannot exceed
the sum of prices of individual items it contains. This natural constraint has
enabled several positive results in multi-item mechanism design bypassing
well-established impossibility results.
  Our work addresses a main open question from this literature involving the
design of buy-many mechanisms for multiple buyers. Our main result is that a
simple sequential item pricing mechanism with buyer-specific prices can achieve
an $O(\log m)$ approximation to the revenue of any buy-many mechanism when all
buyers have unit-demand preferences over $m$ items. This is the best possible
as it directly matches the previous results for the single-buyer setting where
no simple mechanism can obtain a better approximation. Our result applies in
full generality: even though there are many alternative ways buy-many
mechanisms can be defined for multi-buyer settings, our result captures all of
them at the same time. We achieve this by directly competing with a more
permissive upper-bound on the buy-many revenue, obtained via an ex-ante
relaxation.

decoupled into two sub-problems: one is the user association sub-problem, which
gets the optimal matching strategy between aerial and ground nodes for certain
UAV-BS positions; and the other is the UAV-BS deployment sub-problem trying to
find the best position combination of the UAV-BSs that make the solution of the
first sub-problem optimal among all the possible position combinations of the
UAV-BSs. In the proposed mechanism, we transform the user association
sub-problem into an equivalent bipartite matching problem and solve it using
the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. For the UAV-BS deployment sub-problem, we
theoretically prove that adopting the best UAV-BS deployment strategy of a
previous user distribution for each new user distribution will introduce little
performance decline compared with the new user distribution's ground true best
strategy if the two user distributions are similar enough. Based on our
mathematical analyses, the similarity level between user distributions is well
defined and becomes the key to solve the second sub-problem. Numerical results
indicate that the proposed UDUA mechanism can achieve near-optimal system
performance in terms of average downlink sum transmission throughput and
failure rate with enormously reduced computing time compared with benchmark

investigates the potential demand for microtransit options against the
background of the pandemic. We use a stated choice experiment to study the
decision-making of Israeli public transit and car commuters when offered to use
novel microtransit options (sedan vs. passenger van). We investigate the
tradeoffs related to traditional fare and travel time attributes, along with
microtransit features; namely walking time to pickup location, vehicle sharing,
waiting time, minimum advanced reservation time, and shelter at designated

towards sharing, as well as experiences and risk-perceptions related to the

commuters compared to relative insensitivity of transit commuters to the risk

algorithm convergence difficulty. Besides, most PT methods still rely on the

we introduce expert knowledge to guide the agent to make better decisions in
RL-based PT and propose a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning-based
generic intelligent Penetration testing framework, denoted as GAIL-PT, to solve
the problems of higher labor costs due to the involvement of security experts
and high-dimensional discrete action space. Specifically, first, we manually
collect the state-action pairs to construct an expert knowledge base when the

different RL / DRL models into the discriminator of GAIL for training. At last,
we apply the output reward of the discriminator to guide the agent to perform
the action with a higher penetration success rate to improve PT's performance.
Extensive experiments conducted on the real target host and simulated network

artificial-neural-network for k-space interpolation (RAKI) exhibits superior
noise resilience over other linear methods. However, RAKI performs poorly at
high acceleration rates, and needs a large amount of autocalibration signals as
the training samples. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a
multi-weight method that implements multiple weighting matrices on the
undersampled data, named as MW-RAKI. Enforcing multiple weighted matrices on
the measurements can effectively reduce the influence of noise and increase the
data constraints. Furthermore, we incorporate the strategy of multiple
weighting matrixes into a residual version of RAKI, and form
MW-rRAKI.Experimental compari-sons with the alternative methods demonstrated
noticeably better reconstruction performances, particularly at high
acceleration rates.

systems. However, despite the extensive impacts of methods such as receding
horizon control, dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the design of
cost functions for a particular system often remains a heuristic-driven process
of trial and error. In this paper we seek to gain insights into how the choice
of cost function interacts with the underlying structure of the control system
and impacts the amount of computation required to obtain a stabilizing

  We treat the cost design problem as a two-step process where the designer
specifies outputs for the system that are to be penalized and then modulates
the relative weighting of the inputs and the outputs in the cost. To
characterize the computational burden associated to obtaining a stabilizing
controller with a particular cost, we bound the prediction horizon required by
receding horizon methods and the number of iterations required by dynamic
programming methods to meet this requirement. Our theoretical results highlight
a qualitative separation between what is possible, from a design perspective,
when the chosen outputs induce either minimum-phase or non-minimum-phase
behavior. Simulation studies indicate that this separation also holds for
modern reinforcement learning methods.

single-object spectroscopy will provide necessary follow-up information for
supernova and strong lensing cosmology, while highly-multiplexed spectroscopy
both from smaller facilities over wide fields and from larger facilities over
narrower regions of sky will yield more accurate photometric redshift estimates

provide critical spectroscopic host galaxy redshifts for supernova Hubble
diagrams, provide improved understanding of limiting astrophysical systematic

remains limited. In this work, density functional theory-based simulations are
used to investigate the physical nature of the reactions taking place during
the fabrication of RMCs under ambient conditions. Parametric indicators such as
adsorption energies, charge transfer, electron localization function,
adsorption/dissociation energy barriers and the mechanisms of interaction of
H2O and CO2 molecules with MgO and brucite (Mg(OH)2) clusters are considered.
The following hydration and carbonation interactions relevant to RMCs are
evaluated i) carbonation of MgO, ii) hydration of MgO, carbonation of hydrated
MgO, iii) carbonation of Mg(OH)2, iv) hydration of Mg(OH)2 and v) hydration of
carbonated Mg(OH)2. A comparison of the energy barriers and reaction pathways
of these mechanisms shows that the carbonation of MgO is hindered by presence
of H2O molecules, while the carbonation of Mg(OH)2 is hindered by the formation
of initial carbonate and hydrate layers as well as presence of excessed H2O
molecules. To compare these finding to bulk mineral surfaces, the interactions
of the CO2 and H2O molecules with the MgO(001) and Mg(OH)2 (001) surfaces are
studied. Therefore, this work presents deep insights into the physical nature

realization and possible deployment of protective mechanisms is closely linked
to aspects of redundancy in ADS-B sensor coverage. In particular, we model
ADS-B sensor coverage as a multi-dimensional security problem. We then use
multi-objective optimization techniques to tackle this problem and derive

treated separately, and even the recent trends of cloud computing, distributed
computing, and mobile edge computing have not fundamentally changed the role of
networks, still designed to move data between end users and pre-determined
computation nodes, without true optimization of the end-to-end
compute-communication process. However, the emergence of Metaverse
applications, where users consume multimedia experiences that result from the
real-time combination of distributed live sources and stored digital assets,
has changed the requirements for, and possibilities of, systems that provide
distributed caching, computation, and communication. We argue that the
real-time interactive nature and high demands on data storage, streaming rates,
and processing power of Metaverse applications will accelerate the merging of
the cloud into the network, leading to highly-distributed tightly-integrated
compute- and data-intensive networks becoming universal compute platforms for
next-generation digital experiences. In this paper, we first describe the
requirements of Metaverse applications and associated supporting
infrastructure, including relevant use cases. We then outline a comprehensive
cloud network flow mathematical framework, designed for the end-to-end
optimization and control of such systems, and show numerical results
illustrating its promising role for the efficient operation of Metaverse-ready

recommendation based on previously recorded sessions of user interaction. The
majority of existing approaches to SR focus on modeling the transition patterns
of items. In such models, the so-called micro-behaviors describing how the user
locates an item and carries out various activities on it (e.g., click,
add-to-cart, and read-comments), are simply ignored. A few recent studies have
tried to incorporate the sequential patterns of micro-behaviors into SR models.
However, those sequential models still cannot effectively capture all the
inherent interdependencies between micro-behavior operations. In this work, we
aim to investigate the effects of the micro-behavior information in SR
systematically. Specifically, we identify two different patterns of
micro-behaviors: ""sequential patterns"" and ""dyadic relational patterns"". To
build a unified model of user micro-behaviors, we first devise a multigraph to
aggregate the sequential patterns from different items via a graph neural
network, and then utilize an extended self-attention network to exploit the
pair-wise relational patterns of micro-behaviors. Extensive experiments on
three public real-world datasets show the superiority of the proposed approach
over the state-of-theart baselines and confirm the usefulness of these two
different micro-behavior patterns for SR.

constrained self-consistent mean-field (SCMF) calculations using a universal
energy density functional and a pairing interaction provide the potential
energy surfaces in terms of the axially-symmetric quadrupole and octupole
deformations for the even-even nuclei $^{86-94}$Se, $^{88-96}$Kr, $^{90-98}$Sr,
$^{92-100}$Zr, and $^{94-102}$Mo. The SCMF energy surface is then mapped onto
the energy expectation value of a version of the IBM in the boson condensate
state, which consists of the neutron and proton monopole $s$, quadrupole $d$,
and octupole $f$ bosons. This procedure determines the strength parameters of
the IBM Hamiltonian, which is used to compute relevant spectroscopic
properties. At the SCMF level, no octupole deformed ground state is obtained,
while the energy surface is generally soft in the octupole deformation at

$3^-_1$ weakly depend on $N$ and become lowest in energy at $N=56$ in each of

octupole transition rates between the lowest negative- and the positive-parity

make veracity predictions only when there is sufficient evidence and otherwise
indicate when it is not enough. To this end, we are the first to study what
information FC models consider sufficient by introducing a novel task and
advancing it with three main contributions. First, we conduct an in-depth
empirical analysis of the task with a new fluency-preserving method for
omitting information from the evidence at the constituent and sentence level.
We identify when models consider the remaining evidence (in)sufficient for FC,
based on three trained models with different Transformer architectures and
three FC datasets. Second, we ask annotators whether the omitted evidence was
important for FC, resulting in a novel diagnostic dataset, SufficientFacts, for
FC with omitted evidence. We find that models are least successful in detecting
missing evidence when adverbial modifiers are omitted (21% accuracy), whereas
it is easiest for omitted date modifiers (63% accuracy). Finally, we propose a
novel data augmentation strategy for contrastive self-learning of missing
evidence by employing the proposed omission method combined with tri-training.
It improves performance for Evidence Sufficiency Prediction by up to 17.8 F1

in the SOD dataset for VSOD efficiently, we introduce dynamic saliency to
compensate for the lack of motion information of SOD during the locating

for generating spatiotemporal location labels, which consists of generating
high-saliency location labels and tracking salient objects in adjacent frames,
is proposed. Based on these location labels, a two-stream locating network that
introduces an optical flow branch for video salient object locating is
presented. Although our method does not require labeled video at all, the
experimental results on five public benchmarks of DAVIS, FBMS, ViSal, VOS, and

an auxiliary model, is trained jointly with the discriminator to sample
plausible alternative next items and will be thrown out after training. The

  Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS 2022)",,"10.1145/3524844.3528057",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPSS) denote a service-oriented (SO) way
of providing access to CPS capabilities. The design of such systems bears high
risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and
behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and
uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure
continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes.
A modular and SO system architecture complements these processes to facilitate
IT system adaptation and evolution. This work proposes a method to use and
extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous
optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing
needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations
by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service
adaptations at CPS runtime. The method builds on transferring IT DevOps
principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates,
reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps
requirements derived from literature. We use these requirements to propose a
DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled
DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for
operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and
architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the
implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS
IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration. The self-adaptive CPS model and DT
design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for
operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond cycle
times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation
interferences and downtime.

  for Low-Resource Automatic Speech Recognition","5 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unpaired data has shown to be beneficial for low-resource automatic speech
recognition~(ASR), which can be involved in the design of hybrid models with
multi-task training or language model dependent pre-training. In this work, we
leverage unpaired data to train a general sequence-to-sequence model. Unpaired
speech and text are used in the form of data pairs by generating the
corresponding missing parts in prior to model training. Inspired by the
complementarity of speech-PseudoLabel pair and SynthesizedAudio-text pair in
both acoustic features and linguistic features, we propose a complementary
joint training~(CJT) method that trains a model alternatively with two data
pairs. Furthermore, label masking for pseudo-labels and gradient restriction
for synthesized audio are proposed to further cope with the deviations from
real data, termed as CJT++. Experimental results show that compared to
speech-only training, the proposed basic CJT achieves great performance
improvements on clean/other test sets, and the CJT++ re-training yields further
performance enhancements. It is also apparent that the proposed method
outperforms the wav2vec2.0 model with the same model size and beam size,
particularly in extreme low-resource cases.

axially symmetric magnetized Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black hole for both neutral
and charged particles. We start with the study of the geometry of the black
hole and find the regions where the $g_{tt}$ component of the metric tensor is
positive (i.e., $g_{tt}>0$). It is interestingly found that the condition
$g_{tt}>0$ is fulfilled not only close to the event horizon known as the
ergosphere but also far away from the event horizon in the silhouette of
potential wells. We also show that as the dimensionless magnetic field $B$
increases the silhouette of potential wells for which $g_{tt}>0$ grows
correspondingly and eventually merges with the ergoregion when $B\gtrsim 1.6$.
Finally, we investigate the efficiency of the Penrose process for the axially
symmetric magnetized black hole case and bring out the effect of the magnetic
field on it. Further, we also compare our results with the one for Kerr black
hole. We show that when the charge $Q$ of the black hole is kept constant, the
efficiency of the energy extraction process for the case of {a neutral particle
(i.e., $q/m=0$) first increases and then begins to decrease with rise in the
value of $B$ field, in contrast to Kerr black hole where it always increases as
the rotation parameter grows. However, for the case of a charged particle
(i.e., $q\neq 0$) the efficiency always increases with the rise in the $B$
field and can go over $100\%$, when both $B$ and $q/m$ are large enough (say
$B\approx1$ and $q/m>2.2$)}. It is worth noting that the existence of regions
away from the horizon where $g_{tt}>0$ also favors the energy-extraction
process away from the effect of the black hole. However, the energy extraction
from these regions is pure consequence of the magnetic field.

too closely fits the training data while performing poorly in the test data.
Among various methods of coping with overfitting, dropout is one of the
representative ways. From randomly dropping neurons to dropping neural
structures, dropout has achieved great success in improving model performances.
Although various dropout methods have been designed and widely applied in past
years, their effectiveness, application scenarios, and contributions have not
been comprehensively summarized and empirically compared by far. It is the
right time to make a comprehensive survey.
  In this paper, we systematically review previous dropout methods and classify
them into three major categories according to the stage where dropout operation
is performed. Specifically, more than seventy dropout methods published in top
AI conferences or journals (e.g., TKDE, KDD, TheWebConf, SIGIR) are involved.
The designed taxonomy is easy to understand and capable of including new
dropout methods. Then, we further discuss their application scenarios,
connections, and contributions. To verify the effectiveness of distinct dropout
methods, extensive experiments are conducted on recommendation scenarios with
abundant heterogeneous information. Finally, we propose some open problems and
potential research directions about dropout that worth to be further explored.

accurate and reliable as those of other meteorological variables. A major
contributing factor to this is that several key processes affecting
precipitation distribution and intensity occur below the resolved scale of
global weather models. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been
demonstrated by the computer vision community to be successful at
super-resolution problems, i.e., learning to add fine-scale structure to coarse
images. Leinonen et al. (2020) previously applied a GAN to produce ensembles of
reconstructed high-resolution atmospheric fields, given coarsened input data.
In this paper, we demonstrate this approach can be extended to the more
challenging problem of increasing the accuracy and resolution of comparatively
low-resolution input from a weather forecasting model, using high-resolution
radar measurements as a ""ground truth"". The neural network must learn to add
resolution and structure whilst accounting for non-negligible forecast error.
We show that GANs and VAE-GANs can match the statistical properties of
state-of-the-art pointwise post-processing methods whilst creating
high-resolution, spatially coherent precipitation maps. Our model compares
favourably to the best existing downscaling methods in both pixel-wise and
pooled CRPS scores, power spectrum information and rank histograms (used to
assess calibration). We test our models and show that they perform in a range
of scenarios, including heavy rainfall.

methods, in ten large arid river basins: Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus, Tarim,
Amu, Ili, Syr, Junggar, Colorado, and San Joaquin. Managers in basins at more
advanced phases of development implemented drip and groundwater irrigation,
which effectively controlled salinity by lowering groundwater levels. For the
remaining basins where conventional flood irrigation is used, economic
development and policies are crucial to establishing a virtuous circle of
improving irrigation systems, reducing salinity, and increasing agricultural

increases, and then tends to stable in the high state, which are briefly named
the redder-stable-when-brighter (RSWB) and bluer-stable-when-brighter (BSWB)
behaviors, respectively. 34 FSRQs and 7 BL Lacs exhibit clear RSWB behavior,
and 2 FSRQs and 5 BL Lacs show distinct BSWB behavior, which mean that FSRQs
favor more RSWB than BSWB behavior, while BL Lacs have no clear preference
among both behaviors. We have put forward a unified nonlinear formula to
quantitatively characterize the optical spectral behaviors of FSRQs and BL
Lacs, which can fit both kinds of behaviors very well. We argue that the RSWB

universal optical spectral behaviors for blazars. The frequently observed

understanding of the existence of ferromagnetism and its disappearance under
heating to high temperatures. Although a qualitative description was possible
by the Curie-Weiss theory it was obvious that a microscopic model was necessary
to explain the tendency of the elementary magnetons to prefer parallel ordering
at low temperatures. Such a model was proposed in 1922 by W. Schottky within
the old Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum mechanics and claimed to explain the high
values of the Curie temperatures of certain ferromagnets. Based on this idea
Ising formulated a new model for ferromagnetism in solids. Simultaneously the
old quantum mechanics was replaced by new concepts of Heisenberg and
Schr\""odinger and the discovery of spin. Thus Schottky's idea was outperformed
and finally replaced in 1928 by Heisenberg exchange interaction. This led to a
reformulation of Ising's model by Pauli at the Solvay conference in 1930.
Nevertheless one might consider Schottky's idea as a forerunner of this
development explaining and asserting that the main point is the Coulomb energy
leading to the essential interaction of neighboring elementary magnets.

viewed as an out-of-equilibrium dissipative structure that can only be
maintained with a flow of energy and matter. The distinctive approach
emphasized here consists in capturing the economic impact of natural ecosystems
being depleted and destroyed by human activities via a pinch of thermodynamic
potentials. This viewpoint allows: (i) the full-blown integration of a limited
quantity of primary resources into a non-linear macrodynamics that is
stock-flow consistent both in terms of matter-energy as well as economic
transactions; (ii) the inclusion of natural and forced recycling; (iii) the
inclusion of a friction term which reflects the impossibility of producing
goods and services in high metabolising intensity without exuding energy and
matter wastes; (iv) the computation of the anthropically produced entropy as a
function of intensity and friction. Analysis and numerical computations confirm
the role played by intensity and friction as key factors for sustainability.
Our approach is flexible enough to allow for various economic models to be

covariance matrix based verification systems together with detection error

narrow-band, wide-band (0-8 kHz), and bandwidth-extended speech. The
experiments were conducted using different short-time spectral
parameterizations derived from microphone and ISDN speech databases. The
studied bandwidth-extension algorithm did not introduce artifacts that affected
the speaker verification task, and we achieved improvements between 1 and 10
percent (depending on the model order) over the verification system designed
for narrow-band speech when mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for the
short-time spectral parameterization were used.

environmental interactions with minimal to no prior knowledge. However,
existing reinforcement learning algorithms assume an episodic setting, in which
the agent resets to a fixed initial state distribution at the end of each
episode, to successfully train the agents from repeated trials. Such reset
mechanism, while trivial for simulated tasks, can be challenging to provide for
real-world robotics tasks. Resets in robotic systems often require extensive
human supervision and task-specific workarounds, which contradicts the goal of
autonomous robot learning. In this paper, we propose an extension to
conventional reinforcement learning towards greater autonomy by introducing an
additional agent that learns to reset in a self-supervised manner. The reset
agent preemptively triggers a reset to prevent manual resets and implicitly
imposes a curriculum for the forward agent. We apply our method to learn from
scratch on a suite of simulated and real-world continuous control tasks and
demonstrate that the reset agent successfully learns to reduce manual resets
whilst also allowing the forward policy to improve gradually over time.

with a small amount of Cr atoms substituting for Mn. In order to investigate
the origin of the ferromagnetism in Cd1-x-yMnxCryTe, we have studied its
element specific magnetic properties by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and
x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Cr and Mn L2,3 edges. Thin
films were grown by molecular beam epitaxy with a fixed Mn content of x = 0.2

spectra indicate that both Cr and Mn atoms are divalent and that the
ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic components of Cr and Mn are aligned in the
same directions. The magnetization of Mn increases with increasing Cr content.
These results can be explained if ferromagnetic interaction exists between
neighboring Mn and Cr ions although interaction between Mn atoms is largely
antiferromagnetic. We conclude that each ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic

unconventional phenomena, such as non-exponential decay etc. However, their
potential applications are still open questions. In this paper, we propose a
giant-cavity-based quantum sensor for the first time, whose performance can be
greatly enhanced compared to traditional cavity-based sensors. In our proposal,
two cavities couple to a dissipative reservoir at multiple points while they
couple to a gain reservoir in a single-point way. To detecting a unknown
parameter using this sensor, a waveguide is coupled to one of the cavities
where detecting fields can pass through for homodyne detection. We find that
multiple position-dependent couplings can induce an inherent non-reciprocal
coupling between the cavities, which can enhance the performance of sensors.
Output noise in our scheme can be reduced to the shot noise level, which is
about one order magnitude lower than the results in Ref. [Nature
Communications, 2018, 9, 4320.]. Besides, the signal-to-noise ratio per photon
is also enhanced by about one order of magnitude. These results show that the

structures. However, small-scale density structures play an important role in
the life cycle of the ISM, and determine the fraction of cold, dense gas, the
amount of star formation and the amount of radiation and momentum leakage from
cloud-embedded sources. Here, we derive a $statistical\, model$ to calculate
the unresolved small-scale ISM density structure from coarse-grained,
volume-averaged quantities such as the $gas\, clumping\, factor$,
$\mathcal{C}$, and mean density $\left<\rho\right>_V$. Assuming that the
large-scale ISM density is statistically isotropic, we derive a relation
between the three-dimensional clumping factor, $\mathcal{C}_\rho$, and the
clumping factor of the $4\pi$ column density distribution on the cloud surface,
$\mathcal{C}_\Sigma$, and find $\mathcal{C}_\Sigma=\mathcal{C}_\rho^{2/3}$.
Applying our model to calculate the covering fraction, i.e., the $4\pi$ sky
distribution of optically thick sight-lines around sources inside interstellar
gas clouds, we demonstrate that small-scale density structures lead to
significant differences at fixed physical ISM density. Our model predicts that
gas clumping increases the covering fraction by up to 30 per cent at low ISM
densities compared to a uniform medium. On the other hand, at larger ISM
densities, gas clumping suppresses the covering fraction and leads to increased
scatter such that covering fractions can span a range from 20 to 100 per cent
at fixed ISM density. All data and example code is publicly available at

tracking method based on a low-dimension adaptive feature fusion is proposed to
allow us the simultaneous implementation of the high-accuracy and real-time
target tracking. First, the adaptive fusion of a histogram of oriented gradient
(HOG) feature and color feature is utilized to improve the tracking accuracy.
Second, a convolution dimension reduction method applies to the fusion between
the HOG feature and color feature to reduce the over-fitting caused by their
high-dimension fusions. Third, an average correlation energy estimation method
is used to extract the relative confidence adaptive coefficients to ensure
tracking accuracy. We experimentally confirm the proposed method on an OTB100
data set. Compared with nine popular target tracking algorithms, the proposed
algorithm gains the highest tracking accuracy and success tracking rate.
Compared with the traditional Sum of Template and Pixel-wise LEarners (STAPLE)
algorithm, the proposed algorithm can obtain a higher success rate and
accuracy, improving by 0.023 and 0.019, respectively. The experimental results
also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reach the real-time target

an extremely compact cold molecular gas distribution (median R$_{CO}$ $\sim$0.7

than the stellar size. The molecular size of LIRGs is similar to that of
early-type galaxies (R$_{CO}\sim$1 kpc) and about a factor of 6 more compact
than local Spirals of similar stellar mass. Only the CO emission in low-z
ULIRGs is more compact than these local LIRGs by a factor of 2. Compared to
high-z (1$<$z$<$6) systems, the stellar sizes and masses of local LIRGs are
similar to those of high-z MS star-forming galaxies (SFG) and about a factor of
2-3 lower than sub-mm galaxies (SMG). The molecular sizes of high-z MS SFGs and
SMGs are larger than those derived for LIRGs by a factor of $\sim$3 and

MS-SFGs have similar stellar masses and sizes, the regions of current star
formation (traced by the ionized gas) and of potential star-formation (traced
by the molecular gas) are substantially smaller in LIRGs, and constrained to
the central kpc region. High-z galaxies represent a wider population but their
star-forming regions are more extended, even covering the overall size of the
host galaxy. High-z galaxies have larger fractions of gas than low-z LIRGs, and
therefore the formation of stars could be induced by interactions and mergers
in extended disks or filaments with large enough molecular gas surface density
involving physical mechanisms similar to those identified in the central kpc of

theory. However, they usually come with a critical assumption - access to an
accurate model of the system. In practice, models are far from perfect. Even
precisely tuned estimates of unknown parameters will deteriorate over time.
Therefore, it is essential to detect the change to avoid suboptimal or even
dangerous behavior of a control system. We propose to combine statistical tests
with dedicated parameter filters that track unknown system parameters from
state data. These filters yield point estimates of the unknown parameters and,
further, an inherent notion of uncertainty. When the point estimate leaves the
confidence region, we trigger active learning experiments. We update models
only after enforcing a sufficiently small uncertainty in the filter. Thus,
models are only updated when necessary and statistically significant while
ensuring guaranteed improvement, which we call event-triggered learning. We
validate the proposed method in numerical simulations of a DC motor in
combination with model predictive control.

the applications of the KIDS-EDF models to investigate the implications of the

Remarkable results are given by the KIDS0-m*87 and SLy4 models, in which $M_n^*
/M \lesssim 1$, and their NMFPs are quite higher in comparison with those
obtained from the KIDS0, KIDS-A, and KIDS-B models, which result in $M_n^*/M
\gtrsim 1$. For the KIDS0, KIDS-A, and KIDS-B models, we obtain $\lambda

NS cooling and neutrino trapping in NSs. In contrast, the KIDS0-m*87 and SLy4
models yield $\lambda \gtrsim R_{\textrm{NS}}$ and thus we expect faster NS
cooling and a small possibility of neutrino trapping within NSs. We also
calculate the NMFP as a function of the neutrino energy and the nuclear matter

Retirement homes are particularly vulnerable due to the higher mortality risk
of infected elderly individuals. Once an outbreak occurs, suppressing the
spread of the virus in retirement homes is challenging because the residents
are in contact with each other, and isolation measures cannot be widely
enforced. Regular testing strategies, on the other hand, have been shown to
effectively prevent outbreaks in retirement homes. However, high frequency
testing may consume substantial staff working time, which results in a
trade-off between the time invested in testing, and the time spent providing
essential care to residents. Thus, developing an optimal testing strategy is
crucial to proactively detect infections while guaranteeing efficient use of
limited staff time in these facilities. Although numerous efforts have been
made to prevent the virus from spreading in long-term care facilities, this is
the first study to develop testing strategies based on formal optimization
methods. This paper proposes two novel optimization models for testing
schedules. The models aim to minimize the risk of infection in retirement
homes, considering the trade-off between the probability of infection and staff
workload. We employ a probabilistic approach in conjunction with the
optimization models, to compute the risk of infection, including contact rates,
incidence status, and the probability of infection of the residents. To solve
the models, we propose an enhanced local search algorithm by leveraging the
symmetry property of the optimal solution. We perform several experiments with
realistically sized instances and show that the proposed approach can derive
optimal testing strategies.

Turing machines provide the fundamental model of today's digital computers.
However, it has been shown that Turing machines are incapable of solving finite
dimensional inverse problems for any given accuracy. This stimulates the
question of how powerful the computing model must be to enable the general
solution of finite dimensional inverse problems. This paper investigates the
general computation framework of Blum-Shub-Smale (BSS) machines which allows
the processing and storage of arbitrary real values. Although a corresponding
real world computing device does not exist at the moment, research and
development towards real number computing hardware, usually referred to by the

show that real number computing in the framework of BSS machines does enable

developing weaker forms of supervision -- e.g., hyperparameters discovered with
a small number of validation samples with spurious attribute annotation -- but
none of the methods retain comparable performance to methods using full
supervision on the spurious attribute. In this paper, instead of searching for
weaker supervisions, we ask: Given access to a fixed number of samples with
spurious attribute annotations, what is the best achievable worst-group loss if
we ""fully exploit"" them? To this end, we propose a pseudo-attribute-based
algorithm, coined Spread Spurious Attribute (SSA), for improving the
worst-group accuracy. In particular, we leverage samples both with and without
spurious attribute annotations to train a model to predict the spurious
attribute, then use the pseudo-attribute predicted by the trained model as
supervision on the spurious attribute to train a new robust model having
minimal worst-group loss. Our experiments on various benchmark datasets show
that our algorithm consistently outperforms the baseline methods using the same
number of validation samples with spurious attribute annotations. We also
demonstrate that the proposed SSA can achieve comparable performances to
methods using full (100%) spurious attribute supervision, by using a much

assumes that only a small portion of training images are labeled and the others
remain unlabeled. The unlabeled images are usually assigned pseudo labels to be
used in training, which however often causes the risk of performance
degradation due to the confirmation bias towards errors on the pseudo labels.
We present a novel method that resolves this chronic issue of pseudo labeling.
At the heart of our method lies error localization network (ELN), an auxiliary
module that takes an image and its segmentation prediction as input and
identifies pixels whose pseudo labels are likely to be wrong. ELN enables
semi-supervised learning to be robust against inaccurate pseudo labels by
disregarding label noises during training and can be naturally integrated with
self-training and contrastive learning. Moreover, we introduce a new learning
strategy for ELN that simulates plausible and diverse segmentation errors
during training of ELN to enhance its generalization. Our method is evaluated
on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, where it outperforms all existing methods in
every evaluation setting.

placed into the data set as an additional feature for classification model
training; this results in significant improvements in the subsequent
classification performance. SHEEP contains two distinct classification
methodologies: (i) Multi-class and (ii) one versus all with correction by a
meta-learner. We demonstrate the performance of SHEEP for the classification of
stars, galaxies, and quasars using a data set composed of SDSS and WISE
photometry of 3.5 million astronomical sources. The resulting F1-scores are as
follows: 0.992 for galaxies; 0.967 for quasars; and 0.985 for stars. In terms
of the F1-scores for the three classes, SHEEP is found to outperform a recent
RandomForest-based classification approach using an essentially identical data
set. Our methodology also facilitates model and data set explainability via
feature importances; it also allows the selection of sources whose uncertain
classifications may make them interesting sources for follow-up observations.

Project. The radio-selected sample of 7826 COSMOS galaxies with robust
optical/near-infrared counterparts, photometric coverage, and the COSMOS X-ray
galaxy groups (M_200c > 10^13.5 M_sun) enables us to construct the RLF of group
galaxies (GGs) and their contribution to the total RLF since z ~ 2.3. Using the
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we fit a redshift-dependent pure luminosity
evolution model and a linear and power-law model to the luminosity functions.
We compare it with past RLF studies from VLA-COSMOS on individual populations
of radio-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and galaxies hosting active
galactic nuclei (AGN), classified based on the presence or absence of a radio
excess concerning the star-formation rates derived from the infrared emission.
We observe a nearly flat RLF in GGs up to z ~ 1 and then a sharp drop, which
agrees with literature and is related to AGN occupying less massive galaxy
groups above z > 1. The fraction of radio group galaxies mildly evolves by a
factor of ~ 2 from z ~ 2 to 0.07. This evolution in the GG RLF is driven mainly
by satellite galaxies in groups. Group galaxies associated with AGN or SFGs
dominate the GG RLF at z_med= 0.3. At z ~ 1, the peak in the RLF, coinciding
with a known overdensity in COSMOS, is mainly driven by AGN, while at z > 1
SFGs dominate the RLF of group galaxies. This is due to the low abundance of
massive groups at high-z and the AGN occupying lower halo mass groups. The
study provides an observational probe for the accuracy of the numerical
predictions of the radio emission in galaxies in a group environment.

not allow fast data processing for, e.g real-time and high-resolution videos.
This work introduces Hyplex, a new integrated architecture addressing the
limitations discussed above. Hyplex is a CMOS-compatible, fast hyperspectral
camera that replaces bulk optics with nanoscale metasurfaces inversely designed
through artificial intelligence. Hyplex does not require spectrometers but
makes use of conventional monochrome cameras, opening up the possibility for
real-time and high-resolution hyperspectral imaging at inexpensive costs.
Hyplex exploits a model-driven optimization, which connects the physical
metasurfaces layer with modern visual computing approaches based on end-to-end
training. We design and implement a prototype version of Hyplex and compare its
performance against the state-of-the-art for typical imaging tasks such as
spectral reconstruction and semantic segmentation. In all benchmarks, Hyplex
reports the smallest reconstruction error. We additionally present what is, to
the best of our knowledge, the largest publicly available labeled hyperspectral
dataset for semantic segmentation.

$h_{\mu n}$ and scalar $h_{mn}$ modes, we find the masses and wavefunctions of
the Kaluza-Klein tower of spin-2 states. We explore how the masses and
wavefunctions depend on the balance between the strength of the warping and the
size of the bulk, and how these relate to the range and strength of the
interactions which correct the Newtonian gravitational potential. By computing
the modified Newtonian potential for sources on a brane somewhere along the
throat, and applying consistency constraints on the Klebanov-Strassler
parameters, we obtain predictions for the phenomenological parameter space. In
the case of a fully warped throat, and depending on where the brane is along
the throat, these predictions are narrow in range and consistent with current
observational and experimental constraints. We also begin an exploration of
gravitational wave signatures of KK gravitons in warped throats, finding that
strong warping can bring the corresponding frequencies down to the windows of

provide a mixed supervision perspective, in which learning novel categories

tasks. We focus on the supervised setup, in which ground-truth depth is
available only at training time. Based on knowledge about the high regularity
of real 3D scenes, we propose a method that learns to selectively leverage
information from coplanar pixels to improve the predicted depth. In particular,
we introduce a piecewise planarity prior which states that for each pixel,
there is a seed pixel which shares the same planar 3D surface with the former.
Motivated by this prior, we design a network with two heads. The first head
outputs pixel-level plane coefficients, while the second one outputs a dense
offset vector field that identifies the positions of seed pixels. The plane
coefficients of seed pixels are then used to predict depth at each position.
The resulting prediction is adaptively fused with the initial prediction from
the first head via a learned confidence to account for potential deviations
from precise local planarity. The entire architecture is trained end-to-end
thanks to the differentiability of the proposed modules and it learns to
predict regular depth maps, with sharp edges at occlusion boundaries. An
extensive evaluation of our method shows that we set the new state of the art
in supervised monocular depth estimation, surpassing prior methods on NYU
Depth-v2 and on the Garg split of KITTI. Our method delivers depth maps that
yield plausible 3D reconstructions of the input scenes. Code is available at:

$\{1,\ldots,\Delta\}^d$, and we focus on the \emph{high-dimensional regime},
where the algorithm must use space polynomial in $d\cdot\log\Delta$.
  We present a new algorithmic framework, based on importance sampling, for
$O(1)$-approximation of UFL using only $\mathrm{poly}(d\cdot\log\Delta)$ space.
This framework is easy to implement in two passes, one for sampling points and
the other for estimating their contribution. Over random-order streams, we can
extend this to one pass by using the two halves of the stream separately. Our
main result, for arbitrary-order streams, computes $O(d / \log
d)$-approximation in one pass by combining the two passes differently. This
improves upon previous algorithms that either need space $\exp(d)$ or only
guarantee $O(d\cdot\log^2\Delta)$-approximation, and therefore our algorithms
for high dimension are the first to avoid the $O(\log\Delta)$-factor in
approximation that is inherent to the widely-used quadtree decomposition. Our
improvement is achieved by employing a geometric hashing scheme that maps
points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ into buckets of bounded diameter, with the key
property that every point set of small-enough diameter is hashed into few
buckets. By applying an alternative bound for this hashing, we also obtain an
$O(1 / \epsilon)$-approximation in one pass, using larger but still sublinear
space $O(n^{\epsilon})$ where $n$ is the number of clients.
  We complement our results by showing $1.085$-approximation requires space
exponential in $\mathrm{poly}(d\cdot\log\Delta)$.

the low heat capacity of graphene together with JJ nonlinearity can result in
an extremely sensitive microwave bolometer embedded inside a quantum

studied intensively to understand how star formation proceeds under the extreme
conditions of a galactic nucleus. Knowing the position of molecular clouds
along the line of sight toward the Galactic center has had important
implications in our understanding of the physics of the gas and star formation
in the central molecular zone.It was recently claimed that the dense molecular
cloud G0.253 + 0.016 (the Brick) has a distance of $\sim$7.20 kpc from the Sun.
That would place it outside of the central molecular zone, and therefore of the
nuclear stellar disk, but still inside the Bulge.
  Aims. Theoretical considerations as well as observational studies show that
stars that belong to the nuclear stellar disk have different kinematics from
those that belong to the inner Bulge. Therefore, we aim to constrain the
distance to the Brick by studying the proper motions of the stars in the area.
  Results. The stellar population seen toward the nuclear stellar disk shows
the following three kinematic components: 1) Bulge stars with an isotropic
velocity dispersion of $\sim$3.5 micro-arc second per year; 2) eastward moving
stars on the near side of the nuclear stellar disk; and 3) westward moving
stars on the far side of the nuclear stellar disk. We clearly see all three
components toward the comparison field. However, toward the Brick, which blocks
the light from stars behind it, we can only see kinematic components 1) and 2).
  Conclusions. While the Brick blocks the light from stars on the far side of
the nuclear stellar disk, the detection of a significant component of eastward
streaming stars implies that the Brick must be located inside the nuclear
stellar disk and, therefore, that it forms part of the central molecular zone.

that describe the relativistic accretion flow in KTN spacetime which is
characterized by the Kerr parameter ($a_{\rm k}$) and NUT parameter ($n$).
During accretion, rotating flow experiences centrifugal barrier that eventually
triggers the discontinuous shock transition provided the relativistic shock
conditions are satisfied. In reality, the viability of shocked accretion
solution appears more generic over the shock free solution as the former
possesses high entropy content at the inner edge of the disc. Due to shock
compression, the post-shock flow (equivalently post-shock corona, hereafter
PSC) becomes hot and dense, and therefore, can produce high energy radiations
after reprocessing the soft photons from the pre-shock flow via inverse
Comptonization. In general, PSC is characterized by the shock properties,
namely shock location ($r_s$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength
($S$), and we examine their dependencies on the energy (${\cal E}$) and angular
momentum ($\lambda$) of the flow as well as black hole parameters. We identify
the effective domain of the parameter space in $\lambda-{\cal E}$ plane for
shock and observe that shock continues to form for wide range of flow
parameters. We also find that $a_{\rm k}$ and $n$ act oppositely in determining
the shock properties and shock parameter space. Finally, we calculate the disc
luminosity ($L$) considering free-free emissions and observe that accretion
flows containing shocks are more luminous compared to the shock free solutions.

triplets $(A, B, G)$. Given matrices $A$, $B$, and $G$ of compatible
dimensions, such a decomposition provides a coupled low-rank approximation of
the three matrices using a subset of their rows and columns. We pick the subset
of rows and columns of the original matrices by applying the discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM) to the orthogonal and nonsingular matrices from the
restricted singular value decomposition of the matrix triplet. We investigate
the connections between this DEIM type RSVD-CUR approximation and a DEIM type
CUR factorization, and a DEIM type generalized CUR decomposition. We provide an
error analysis that shows that the accuracy of the proposed RSVD-CUR
decomposition is within a factor of the approximation error of the restricted
singular value decomposition of given matrices. An RSVD-CUR factorization may
be suitable for applications where we are interested in approximating one data
matrix relative to two other given matrices. Two applications that we discuss
include multi-view and multi-label dimension reduction, and data perturbation
problems of the form $A_E=A + BFG$, where $BFG$ is a correlated noise matrix.
In numerical experiments, we show the advantages of the new method over the
standard CUR approximation for these applications.

formation and evolution of early galaxies and supermassive black holes.
However, the number of known radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) above
redshift 4 is rather limited. At high redshifts, it appears that blazars, with
relativistically beamed jets pointing towards the observer, are in majority
compared to radio-loud sources with jets misaligned with respect to the line of
sight. To find more of these misaligned AGN, milliarcsec-scale imaging studies
carried out with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) are needed, as they
allow us to distinguish between compact core--jet radio sources and those with
more extended emission. Previous high-resolution VLBI studies revealed that
some of the radio sources among blazar candidates in fact show unbeamed radio
emission on milliarcsecond scales. The most accurate optical coordinates
determined with the Gaia astrometric space mission are also useful in the
classification process. Here, we report on dual-frequency imaging observations
of 13 high-redshift (4 < z < 4.5) quasars at 1.7 and 5 GHz with the European
VLBI Network. This sample increases the number of z>4 radio sources for which
VLBI observations are available by about a quarter. Using structural and
physical properties, such as radio morphology, spectral index, variability,
brightness temperature, as well as optical coordinates, we identified six
blazars and six misaligned radio AGNs, with the remaining one tentatively
identified as blazar.

smallest number of states of any protocol deciding that predicate. For
threshold predicates of the form $x\ge k$, with $k$ constant, prior work has
shown that they have state complexity $\Theta(\log\log k)$ if the protocol is

time, and the state on the remaining sub-domain is measured along another
interval of time. Under the proposed sensing scenario, we control the

during detachment in the MAST-U Super-X divertor using divertor spectroscopy
data. Our analysis indicates detachment in the MAST-U Super-X divertor can be
separated into four sequential phases: First, the ionisation region detaches
from the target at detachment onset leaving a region of increased molecular
densities downstream. The plasma interacts with these molecules, resulting in
molecular ions ($D_2^+$ and/or $D_2^- \rightarrow D + D^-$) that further react
with the plasma leading to Molecular Activated Recombination and Dissociation
(MAR and MAD), which results in excited atoms and significant Balmer line
emission. Second, the MAR region detaches from the target leaving a sub-eV
temperature region downstream. Third, an onset of strong emission from
electron-ion recombination (EIR) ensues. Finally, the electron density decays
near the target, resulting in a density front moving upstream.
  The analysis in this paper indicates that plasma-molecule interactions have a
larger impact than previously reported and play a critical role in the
intensity and interpretation of hydrogen atomic line emission characteristics
on MAST-U. Furthermore, we find that the Fulcher band emission profile in the
divertor can be used as a proxy for the ionisation region and may also be
employed as a plasma temperature diagnostic for improving the separation of
hydrogenic emission arising from electron-impact excitation and that from
plasma-molecular interactions.

eV) during detachment phases III-IV based on quantitative spectroscopy

the next item based on an anonymous behavior sequence, and its performance
relies heavily on the transition information between items in the sequence. The
SOTA methods in SBR employ GNN to model neighboring item transitions from
global (i.e, other sessions) and local (i.e, current session) contexts.
However, most existing methods treat neighbors from different sessions equally
without considering that the neighbor items from different sessions may share
similar features with the target item on different aspects and may have
different contributions. In other words, they have not explored
finer-granularity transition information between items in the global context,
leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we fill this gap by
proposing a novel Transition Information Enhanced Disentangled Graph Neural
Network (TIE-DGNN) model to capture finer-granular transition information
between items and try to interpret the reason of the transition by modeling the
various factors of the item. Specifically, we propose a position-aware global
graph, which utilizes the relative position information to model the
neighboring item transition. Then, we slice item embeddings into blocks, each
of which represents a factor, and use disentangling module to separately learn
the factor embeddings over the global graph. For local context, we train item
embeddings by using attention mechanisms to capture transition information from
the current session. To this end, our model considers two levels of transition
information. Especially in global text, we not only consider finer-granularity
transition information between items but also take user intents at factor-level
into account to interpret the key reason for the transition. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
the SOTA methods.

pronounced in such low-data regimes. 2) We propose to leverage contextual

performance. Finally, our analysis suggests that our novel QA-based slot

normally available in vertically stacked devices. In the course of this study
it was found that separate switching of individual devices carries over its
effects to the complete device (albeit non-linearly), enabling increased
resistive state range, which leads to a larger number of distinguishable states
(above SNR variance limits) and hence enhanced device memory. Additionally, by
applying a switching stimulus to the external electrodes it is possible to
switch both devices simultaneously, making the entire configuration a voltage
divider with individual memristive components. Through usage of this type of
configuration and by taking advantage of the voltage division, it is possible
to surge-protect fragile devices, while it was also found that simultaneous

synchrotron emission from their relativistic jets. However, when the jet
emission is not strong, one could expect signatures of X-ray emission from
inverse Compton scattering of accretion disc photons by the corona. Moreover,
the observed X-ray variability can also originate in the disc, and gets
propagated and amplified by the jet. Here, we present results on the BL Lac
object Mrk 421 using the NuSTAR data acquired during 2017 when the source was
in a moderate X-ray brightness state. For comparison with high jet activity, we
also considered one epoch data in April 2013 during a very high X-ray
brightness state. Our aim is to explore the possibility of the signature of
accretion disc emission in the overall X-ray emission from Mrk 421. The
spectral fitting of the data using the two component advective flow model shows
gives (a) the size of the dynamic corona at the base of the jet from ~28 to 10
r$_s$, (b) the disc mass accretion rate from 0.021 to 0.051 $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$,
(c) the halo mass accretion rate from 0.22 to 0.35 $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$, and (d)
the viscosity parameter of the Keplerian accretion disc from 0.18 $-$ 0.25. In
the assumed model, the total flux, disc and jet flux correlate with the radio
flux observed during these epochs. We conclude that the spectra of all the
epochs of Mrk 421 in 2017 are well described by the accretion disc based two
component advective flow model. The estimated disc and jet flux relations with
radio flux show that accretion disc can contribute to the observed X-ray
emission, when X-ray data (that covers a small portion of the broad band
spectral energy distribution of Mrk 421) is considered in isolation. However,
the present disc based models are disfavoured with respect to the relativistic
jet models when considering the X-ray data in conjunction with data at other
wavelengths.

that the variable absorption column density correlates with the mass accretion

low compared to the escape velocity to drive the wind away from the disc for
the epochs when column densities were high. This suggests that the high and
variable absorption can be due to failed winds from the disc. Our estimated
ratio of mass outflow to inflow rate from the inner region of the disc lies
between $0.019\pm0.006$ and $0.12\pm0.04$. From spectral fitting of the

$4.38\pm0.34 - 4.51\pm0.29 \times10^{6} M_\odot$, consistent with earlier

solved online, whose size scales linearly with the order of the system. The
design of the state tube is formulated as an offline optimization problem,
which offers flexibility to impose desirable features such as robust invariance
on the terminal set. This contrasts with most existing tube MPC strategies
using polytopic sets in the state tube, which are difficult to design and whose
complexity grows combinatorially with the system order. The algorithm
guarantees constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility, and stability of the

The fine-tuned models were tested across all four conferencing datasets plus an

Neutron star structures in this scenario can be significantly different from

currently weaker than the ones coming from binary observations, and they have
relatively low precision due to the approximations in our method. Nevertheless,
our results clearly demonstrate the power of the mass-radius data in testing
gravity, and can be further improved with future observations. The picture is
different for massive scalars, for which the same data is considerably less

identify the main reason for this to be a large high-likelihood region in the
parameter space where deviations from general relativity are relatively small.

network performs much differently when using different reference audios (e.g.
performs poorly for noisy and short-duration reference audios), and tends to
make wrong decisions for transient events (i.e. shorter than $1$ second). To
overcome these problems, in this paper, we present a reference-aware and

the network more aware of the reference information, we propose an embedding
enhancement module to take into account the mixture audio while generating the

sound-related frames and weaken the features of noisy frames. In addition, a

more straightforward parameters to estimate, yet enormous differences can still
be found among published data. This is particularly true for open clusters
located more than a few kpc away. We cross-matched several published catalogues

performed a detailed analysis of their fundamental parameters, with emphasis on
their distances, to determine the agreement between catalogues and our
estimates.} Photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia EDR3 survey was
employed. The data was processed with our own membership analysis code

estimation ($\texttt{ASteCA}$). We find differences in the estimated distances
of up to several kpc between our results and those catalogued, even for the
catalogues that show the best matches with $\texttt{ASteCA}$ values. Large
differences are also found for the age estimates. As a by-product of the
analysis we find that vd Bergh-Hagen 176 could be the open cluster with the
largest heliocentric distance catalogued to date. Caution is thus strongly
recommended when using catalogued parameters of open clusters to infer
large-scale properties of the Galaxy, particularly for those located more than

Mining and detecting opinions from various sources are beneficial to

Anchors are the face of the digital media, and it is required for them not to
be opinionated. However, at times, they diverge from the accepted norm and
insert their opinions into otherwise straightforward news reports, either
purposefully or unintentionally. This is primarily seen in debates as it
requires the anchors to be spontaneous, thus making them vulnerable to add

excellent systems to probe aspects of EEP connected to (proper) time and have
evolved into a working horse for tests of local position invariance (LPI). Even
though the operational definition of time requires localized and idealized
clocks, quantum systems like atoms allow for spatial superpositions that are
inherently delocalized. While quantum experiments have tested other aspects of
EEP, no competitive test of LPI has been performed or proposed allowing for an
intrinsic delocalization. We extend the concepts for tests of the universality
of clock rates (one facet of LPI) to atom interferometry generating delocalized
quantum clocks. The proposed test depends on proper time with a favorable
scaling and is, in contrast to fountain clocks, robust against initial
conditions and recoil effects. It enables optical frequencies so that the
projected sensitivity exceeds the one of state-of-the-art localized clocks.
These results extend our notion of time, detached from classical and localized
philosophies.

As the RO frequencies in the neighboring logic blocks on an FPGA are similar

Experiments using Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs demonstrate that the proposed method

It
proposes that perceptual beliefs are furnished by sequentially minimising
""prediction errors"" - the differences between predicted and observed data.
Implicit in this proposal is the idea that perception requires multiple cycles
of neural activity. This is at odds with evidence that several aspects of
visual perception - including complex forms of object recognition - arise from
an initial ""feedforward sweep"" that occurs on fast timescales which preclude
substantial recurrent activity. Here, we propose that the feedforward sweep can
be understood as performing amortized inference and recurrent processing can be
understood as performing iterative inference. We propose a hybrid predictive
coding network that combines both iterative and amortized inference in a
principled manner by describing both in terms of a dual optimization of a
single objective function. We show that the resulting scheme can be implemented
in a biologically plausible neural architecture that approximates Bayesian
inference utilising local Hebbian update rules. We demonstrate that our hybrid
predictive coding model combines the benefits of both amortized and iterative
inference -- obtaining rapid and computationally cheap perceptual inference for
familiar data while maintaining the context-sensitivity, precision, and sample
efficiency of iterative inference schemes. Moreover, we show how our model is
inherently sensitive to its uncertainty and adaptively balances iterative and
amortized inference to obtain accurate beliefs using minimum computational
expense. Hybrid predictive coding offers a new perspective on the functional
relevance of the feedforward and recurrent activity observed during visual
perception and offers novel insights into distinct aspects of visual
phenomenology.

introduce semiconductor weak links as electrically tunable nonlinear elements,
with demonstrations of microwave resonators and quantum bits using
semiconductor nanowires, a two dimensional electron gas, carbon nanotubes and

stability investigating saddle, stable and unstable points and we thus predict
a chaotic inflation that mimics the Starobinsky exponential potential.
Consequently, the role of the proposed dark matter field is investigated

Prawitz, is one of the most well known proof-theoretical frameworks. Part of
its success is based on the fact that natural deduction rules present a simple
characterization of logical constants, especially in the case of intuitionistic
logic. However, there has been a lot of criticism on extensions of the
intuitionistic set of rules in order to deal with classical logic. Indeed, most
of such extensions add, to the usual introduction and elimination rules, extra
rules governing negation. As a consequence, several meta-logical properties,
the most prominent one being harmony, are lost. Dag Prawitz proposed a natural
deduction ecumenical system, where classical logic and intuitionistic logic are
codified in the same system. In this system, the classical logician and the
intuitionistic logician would share the universal quantifier, conjunction,
negation and the constant for the absurd, but they would each have their own
existential quantifier, disjunction and implication, with different meanings.
Prawitz' main idea is that these different meanings are given by a semantical
framework that can be accepted by both parties. In this paper, we propose a
different approach adapting, to the natural deduction framework, Girard's
mechanism of stoup. This will allow the definition of a pure harmonic natural
deduction system for the propositional fragment of Prawitz' ecumenical logic.

corresponding boundary conditions for the liquid phase are obtained by
minimizing the dissipation rate. Assuming a moderate deformation of the

small parameter is employed. The Stokes equation in the liquid phase under
corresponding boundary conditions is solved to second order in the deformation
using the Keldysh-Sedov formalism. The obtained analytical results are compared

limits of validity of the expansion. While on a planar gas-liquid interface no

hole (BH) and the intracluster medium (ICM). We create initial conditions for
which the ICM is in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential
from the galaxy and an NFW dark matter halo. Two free parameters associated
with the thermodynamic profiles determine the cluster gas fraction and the
central temperature, where the latter can be used to create cool-core or
non-cool-core systems. Our simulations include radiative cooling, star
formation, BH accretion, and stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN)
feedback. Even though the energy of AGN feedback is injected thermally and
isotropically, it leads to anisotropic outflows and buoyantly rising bubbles.
We find that the BH accretion rate (BHAR) is highly variable and only
correlates strongly with the star formation rate (SFR) and the ICM when it is
averaged over more than $1~\rm Myr$. We generally find good agreement with the
theoretical precipitation framework. In $10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$ haloes, AGN
feedback quenches the central galaxy and converts cool-core systems into
non-cool-core systems. In contrast, higher-mass, cool-core clusters evolve
cyclically. Episodes of high BHAR raise the entropy of the ICM out to the
radius where the ratio of the cooling time and the local dynamical time $t_{\rm
cool}/t_{\rm dyn} > 10$, thus suppressing condensation and, after a delay, the
BHAR. The corresponding reduction in AGN feedback allows the ICM to cool and
become unstable to precipitation, thus initiating a new episode of high SFR and
BHAR.

variable-range pairing and different site-dependence of the chemical potential,
addressing commensurable and incommensurable modulations as well as Anderson
disorder. In particular, we analyze multipartite entanglement (ME) in the
ground state of the dirty topological wires by studying the scaling of the
quantum Fisher information (QFI) with the system's size. For nearest-neighbour
pairing the Heisenberg scaling of the QFI is found in one-to-one correspondence
with topological phases hosting Majorana modes. For finite-range pairing, we
recognize long-range phases by the super-extensive scaling of the QFI and
characterize complex lobe-structured phase diagrams. Overall, we observe that
ME is robust against finite strengths of spatial inhomogeneity. This work
contributes to establish ME as a central quantity to study intriguing aspects

(NR) matter densities are observationally determined to be comparable at the
present time, in spite of their greatly different evolution histories. This
`cosmic coincidence' enigma -- also referred to as the `why now? problem' --
relies, by its very definition, on the implicit prior expectation for our
`typicality' in the cosmic (expanding) spacetime volume. Otherwise, this
conundrum does not exist in the first place. It is shown here that this
apparent coincidence could be explained as a non-anthropic observational
selection effect: for us to be typical observers in the comoving (static)
spacetime volume, the cosmic energy budget must contain a non-vanishing DE
component. In addition, it is shown that irrespective of the cosmological
initial conditions and assuming no `new physics', the Universe is most likely
to be observed at a time when the conformal Hubble radius, $\mathcal{H}^{-1}$,
attains a maximum. The latter takes place at the epoch when $\rho_{DE}$ and
$\rho_{m}$, the energy densities of DE and NR matter, respectively, are
comparable. Specifically, our presumed `typicality' along the conformal
timeline, coupled to a few other plausible assumptions, implies that
$R\equiv\rho_{DE}/\rho_{m}$ is `sampled' from a Beta Prime probability
distribution function. A priori 68\% (95\%) confidence range for the ratio is
$0.20<R<3.46$ ($0.033<R<17.20$), with an expectation value of $\bar{R}=3.5$.
These are in agreement with the observationally inferred value, $R_{obs}=2.23$.

quantum kinetic theory, we decompose the polarization vector as the parts
induced by thermal vorticity, shear tensor and the spin Hall effect (SHE). We
find that the polarization induced by SHE and the total polarization strongly
depends on the initial conditions. At $7.7$GeV, SHE gives a sizeable
contribution and even flips the sign of the local polarization along the beam
direction for AMPT initial condition, which is not observed for SMASH initial
condition. Meanwhile, the local polarization along the out-of-plane direction
induced by SHE with AMPT initial condition does not always increase with
decreasing collision energies. Next, we find that the polarization along the
beam direction is sensitive to the baryon diffusion coefficient, but the local
polarization along the out-of-plane direction is not. Our results for the
global polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ agree well with the

resulting in a code sequence with Doppler-tolerance characteristics of an FMCW
waveform and interference immune characteristics of a tailored PMCW waveform
(unique phase code + minimal ISL/PSL). The optimal design sequences possess
polynomial phase behavior of degree Q amongst its sub-sequences and obtain
optimal ISL and PSL solutions with guaranteed convergence. By tuning the
optimization parameters such as degree Q of the polynomial phase behavior,
sub-sequence length M and the total number of sub-sequences L, the optimized
sequences can be as Doppler tolerant as FMCW waveform in one end, and they can
possess small cross-correlation values similar to random-phase sequences in

new codes can be generated in the runtime which have low cross-correlation with

we tackle this problem introducing a novel methodology for discovering which

Although, feature relevance has received much attention in the machine learning

enable prediction of the energy spectra and the intrinsic spatial and spin

double quantum dots. Specifically, in comparison with the case of weak
interactions and treating the entire three-electron double-dot hybrid qubit as
an integral unit, it is shown that the predicted spectroscopic patterns,
originating from strong electron correlations, manifest the formation of Wigner
molecules (WMs). Signatures of WM formation include: (1) a strong suppression
of the energy gaps relative to the non-interacting-electrons modeling, and (2)
the appearance of a pair of avoided crossings arising between states associated
with two-electron occupancies in the left and right wells. The Wigner molecule
is a physical entity associated with electron localization within each well and
it cannot be captured by the previously employed independent-particle or
two-site-Hubbard theoretical modeling of the hybrid qubits. The emergence of
strong WMs is investigated in depth through the concerted use of FCI-adapted
diagnostic tools like charge and spin densities, as well as conditional
probability distributions. Furthermore, the energy spectrum as a function of
the strength of the Coulomb repulsion (at constant detuning) is calculated in
order to complement the thorough analysis of the factors contributing to WM
emergence. We report remarkable agreement with recent experimental
measurements. The present FCI methodology for multi-well quantum dots can be
straightforwardly extended to treat valleytronic two-band Si/SiGe hybrid

electrostatic contribution can be obtained from the first order of a functional
perturbation of the pair potential for an uncharged reference system of hard
spheres. This mean-field electrostatic term particularly contributes at
particle separations that are forbidden due to hard-core overlap. In this work
we modify the mean-field contribution such that the pair potential is constant
for distances smaller than the contact distance of the ions. We motivate our
modification by the underlying splitting of the potential, which is similar to
the splitting of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential and leads to
higher-order terms in the respective expansion of the functional around the
reference system. The resulting formalism involves weighted densities similar
to the ones found in fundamental measure theory. To test our modifications, we
analyze and compare density profiles, direct and total correlation functions,
and the thermodynamic consistency of the functional via a widely established
sum rule and the virial pressure formula for our modified functional, for
established functionals, and for data from computer simulations. We found that
our modifications clearly show improvements compared to the standard mean-field
functional, especially when predicting layering effects and direct correlation
functions in high concentration scenarios; for the latter we also find improved

we demonstrate how modifications towards higher order corrections beyond

problem in computer vision. Kneip et al. proposed to solve this problem by
introducing the normal epipolar constraint (NEC). However, their approach does
not take into account uncertainties, so that the accuracy of the estimated
relative pose is highly dependent on accurate feature positions in the target
frame. In this work, we introduce the probabilistic normal epipolar constraint
(PNEC) that overcomes this limitation by accounting for anisotropic and
inhomogeneous uncertainties in the feature positions. To this end, we propose a
novel objective function, along with an efficient optimization scheme that
effectively minimizes our objective while maintaining real-time performance. In
experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that the novel PNEC yields more
accurate rotation estimates than the original NEC and several popular relative
rotation estimation algorithms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed method
into a state-of-the-art monocular rotation-only odometry system and achieve

$t$-tough graphs? We first give the answer to $1$-tough graphs, i.e. if

Gaussian processes, is used to build surrogates to predict site-specific loads
on an offshore wind turbine. Stochasticity in the inflow turbulence and
irregular waves results in load responses that are best represented as random
variables rather than deterministic values. Moreover, the effect of these
stochastic sources on the loads depends strongly on the mean environmental
conditions -- for instance, at low mean wind speeds, inflow turbulence produces
much less variability in loads than at high wind speeds. Statistically, this is
known as heteroscedasticity. Deterministic and most stochastic surrogates do
not account for the heteroscedastic noise, giving an incomplete and potentially
misleading picture of the structural response. In this paper, we draw on the
recent advancements in statistical inference to train a heteroscedastic
surrogate model on a noisy database to predict the conditional pdf of the
response. The model is informed via 10-minute load statistics of the
IEA-10MW-RWT subject to both aero- and hydrodynamic loads, simulated with

the variation of the optical group delay of a transmitted probe under the

The most general such resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at
the outset of each protocol execution. We call this the Common Reference
Quantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference
String (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but
appears to be more powerful: in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes
exhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle queried once by measuring a
maximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We formalize
this notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the
$m$--bit output to have some randomness when conditioned on the $n$--bit input.
  We show that when $n-m\in\omega(\lg n)$, any protocol for WOTRO in the CRQS
model can be attacked by an (inefficient) adversary. Moreover, our adversary is
efficiently simulatable, which rules out the possibility of proving the
computational security of a scheme by a black-box reduction to a cryptographic
game assumption. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game quantum assumption
for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQ\$ model (where the CRQS
consists only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically secure WOTRO
protocol where $m=n$, then hash the output.
  The impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the
black-box impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the
impossibility result of Bitansky et al. (TCC '13) to the CRQS model. Second, we
show a black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened version of quantum
lightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt '19) where quantum bolts have an additional
parameter that cannot be changed without generating new bolts.

Bayesian inverse problems with guaranteed accuracy. This is motivated by the
ill-posed problem of inferring a spatio-temporal heat-flux parameter known as
the Biot number given temperature data, however the methodology is
generalisable to other settings. To accelerate Bayesian inference, we develop a
novel training scheme that uses data to adaptively train a neural-network
surrogate simulating the parametric forward model. By simultaneously
identifying an approximate posterior distribution over the Biot number, and
weighting a physics-informed training loss according to this, our approach
approximates forward and inverse solution together without any need for
external solves. Using a random Chebyshev series, we outline how to approximate
a Gaussian process prior, and using the surrogate we apply Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) to sample from the posterior distribution. We derive convergence of
the surrogate posterior to the true posterior distribution in the Hellinger
metric as our adaptive loss approaches zero. Additionally, we describe how this
surrogate-accelerated HMC approach can be combined with traditional PDE solvers
in a delayed-acceptance scheme to a-priori control the posterior accuracy. This
overcomes a major limitation of deep learning-based surrogate approaches, which
do not achieve guaranteed accuracy a-priori due to their non-convex training.
Biot number calculations are involved in turbo-machinery design, which is
safety critical and highly regulated, therefore it is important that our
results have such mathematical guarantees. Our approach achieves fast mixing in
high dimensions whilst retaining the convergence guarantees of a traditional
PDE solver, and without the burden of evaluating this solver for proposals that
are likely to be rejected. Numerical results are given using real and simulated

  Event Detection and Scene Classification Tasks","Submitted to INTERSPEECH 2022",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Acoustic scene classification (ASC) and sound event detection (SED) are
fundamental tasks in environmental sound analysis, and many methods based on
deep learning have been proposed. Considering that information on acoustic
scenes and sound events helps SED and ASC mutually, some researchers have
proposed a joint analysis of acoustic scenes and sound events by multitask
learning (MTL). However, conventional works have not investigated in detail how
acoustic scenes and sound events mutually benefit SED and ASC. We, therefore,
investigate the impact of information on acoustic scenes and sound events on
the performance of SED and ASC by using domain adversarial training based on a
gradient reversal layer (GRL) or model training with fake labels. Experimental
results obtained using the TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017 and TUT Sound Events
2016/2017 show that pieces of information on acoustic scenes and sound events
are effectively used to detect sound events and classify acoustic scenes,
respectively. Moreover, upon comparing GRL- and fake-label-based methods with
single-task-based ASC and SED methods, single-task-based methods are found to
achieve better performance. This result implies that even when using
single-task-based ASC and SED methods, information on acoustic scenes may be
implicitly utilized for SED and vice versa.

control for a steel recycling process. The process consists in the production
of new steel by choosing a combination of several different steel scraps with
unknown pollutant content. The pollutant content can only be measured after a
scrap combination is molten, allowing for inference on the pollutants in the
different scrap heaps. The production cost should be minimized while ensuring
high quality of the product through constraining the maximum amount of
pollutant. The dual control formulation allows to achieve the optimal
explore-exploit trade-off between uncertainty reduction and cost minimization
for the examined problem. Specifically, the dual effect is obtained by
considering the dependence of the future pollutant uncertainties on the scrap
selection in the predictions. The implicit formulation promotes uncertainty
reduction indirectly via the impact of active constraints on the objective,
while the explicit formulation adds a heuristic cost on uncertainty to
encourage active exploration. We compare the formulations by numerical
simulations of a simplified but representative industrial steel recycling
process. The results demonstrate the superiority of the two dual formulations
with respect to a robustified but non-dual formulation.

performance in out-of-training distribution settings when compared to entangled

to (a) encoders failing to map novel combinations to the proper regions of the
latent space or (b) novel combinations being mapped correctly but the
decoder/downstream process is unable to render the correct output for the
unseen combinations. We investigate these alternatives by testing several
models on a range of datasets and training settings. We find that (i) when
models fail, their encoders also fail to map unseen combinations to correct
regions of the latent space and (ii) when models succeed, it is either because
the test conditions do not exclude enough examples, or because excluded
generative factors determine independent parts of the output image. Based on
these results, we argue that to generalise properly, models not only need to
capture factors of variation, but also understand how to invert the generative
process that was used to generate the data.

raise concerns about robustness of current VQA models. In this work, we study
the robustness of VQA models from a novel perspective: visual context. We
suggest that the models over-rely on the visual context, i.e., irrelevant
objects in the image, to make predictions. To diagnose the model's reliance on
visual context and measure their robustness, we propose a simple yet effective
perturbation technique, SwapMix. SwapMix perturbs the visual context by
swapping features of irrelevant context objects with features from other
objects in the dataset. Using SwapMix we are able to change answers to more
than 45 % of the questions for a representative VQA model. Additionally, we
train the models with perfect sight and find that the context over-reliance
highly depends on the quality of visual representations. In addition to
diagnosing, SwapMix can also be applied as a data augmentation strategy during
training in order to regularize the context over-reliance. By swapping the
context object features, the model reliance on context can be suppressed
effectively. Two representative VQA models are studied using SwapMix: a
co-attention model MCAN and a large-scale pretrained model LXMERT. Our
experiments on the popular GQA dataset show the effectiveness of SwapMix for
both diagnosing model robustness and regularizing the over-reliance on visual
context. The code for our method is available at

given the lack of large-scale training data in languages other than English --
makes them rarely used in multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval settings.
Current approaches therefore commonly transfer rankers trained on English data
to other languages and cross-lingual setups by means of multilingual encoders:
they fine-tune all parameters of pretrained massively multilingual Transformers
(MMTs, e.g., multilingual BERT) on English relevance judgments, and then deploy
them in the target language(s). In this work, we show that two
parameter-efficient approaches to cross-lingual transfer, namely Sparse
Fine-Tuning Masks (SFTMs) and Adapters, allow for a more lightweight and more
effective zero-shot transfer to multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval tasks.
We first train language adapters (or SFTMs) via Masked Language Modelling and
then train retrieval (i.e., reranking) adapters (SFTMs) on top, while keeping
all other parameters fixed. At inference, this modular design allows us to
compose the ranker by applying the (re)ranking adapter (or SFTM) trained with
source language data together with the language adapter (or SFTM) of a target
language. We carry out a large scale evaluation on the CLEF-2003 and HC4
benchmarks and additionally, as another contribution, extend the former with
queries in three new languages: Kyrgyz, Uyghur and Turkish. The proposed
parameter-efficient methods outperform standard zero-shot transfer with full
MMT fine-tuning, while being more modular and reducing training times. The
gains are particularly pronounced for low-resource languages, where our

(t) = \left( C(u_0) +o_{t\to T}(1) \right) (T-t)^{\frac{2\ell }{\alpha}} \text{
as } t \to T,~~ \ell \in \mathbb{N}^*_+, ~~\alpha>1.$$ In particular, when
$\ell = 1$, this asymptotic is stable whereas for $ \ell \ge 2$ it becomes
stable on a space of codimension $\ell-1$. Our approach here is not based on
energy estimates but on a careful construction of time dependent eigenvectors
and eigenvalues combined with maximum principle and semigroup pointwise
estimates.

behaviors, including their ability to navigate, interact, and self-organize.
However, bacteria dynamics on fluid interfaces are not well understood.
Swimmers adsorbed on fluid interfaces remain highly motile, and fluid
interfaces are highly non-ideal domains that alter swimming behavior. To
understand these effects, we study flow fields generated by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa PA01 in the pusher mode. Analysis of correlated displacements of
tracers and bacteria reveals dipolar flow fields with unexpected asymmetries
that differ significantly from their counterparts in bulk fluids. We decompose
the flow field into fundamental hydrodynamic modes for swimmers in
incompressible fluid interfaces. We find an expected force-doublet mode
corresponding to propulsion and drag at the interface plane, and a second
dipolar mode, associated with forces exerted by the flagellum on the cell body
in the aqueous phase that are countered by Marangoni stresses in the interface.
The balance of these modes depends on the bacteria's trapped interfacial
configurations. Understanding these flows is broadly important in nature and in
the design of biomimetic swimmers.

description of the force between nucleons in terms of meson exchange, a full
understanding of the strong interaction remains a major challenge in modern
science. One remaining difficulty arises from the non-perturbative nature of
the strong force, which leads to the phenomenon of quark confinement at
distances on the order of the size of the proton. Here we show that in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where quarks and gluons are set free over an
extended volume, two species of produced vector (spin-1) mesons, namely $\phi$
and $K^{*0}$, emerge with a surprising pattern of global spin alignment. In
particular, the global spin alignment for $\phi$ is unexpectedly large, while
that for $K^{*0}$ is consistent with zero. The observed spin-alignment pattern
and magnitude for the $\phi$ cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms,
while a model with a connection to strong force fields, i.e. an effective proxy
description within the Standard Model and Quantum Chromodynamics, accommodates
the current data. This connection, if fully established, will open a potential
new avenue for studying the behaviour of strong force fields.

evolve under the action of internal and external photoevaporation, and
different degrees of viscous transport. We identify five distinct dispersal
pathways, which are i) very long lived discs ($>20\,$Myr), ii) inside-out
dispersal where internal photoevaporation dominates and opens inner holes, iii)
outside-in dispersal where external photoevaporation dominates through disc
truncation and two intermediate regimes characterised by lingering material in
the inner disc with the outer disc dispersed predominantly by either internal
or external photoevaporation. We determine how the lifetime, relative impact of
internal and external winds and clearing pathway varies over a wide, plausible,
parameter space of stellar/disc/radiation properties. There are a number of
implications, for example in high UV environments because the outer disc
lifetime is shorter than the time-scale for clearing the inner disc we do not
expect transition discs to be common, which appears to be reflected in the
location of transition disc populations towards the Orion Nebular Cluster.
Irrespective of environment, we find that ongoing star formation is required to
reproduce observed disc fractions as a function of stellar cluster age. This
work demonstrates the importance of including both internal and external winds
for understanding protoplanetary disc evolution.

  Optimal Design",,,,,"math.OC cs.PF math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We develop a Markovian framework for load balancing where classical
algorithms such as Power-of-$d$ are combined with auto-scaling mechanisms,
which allow the net service capacity to scale up or down in response to the
current load within the same timescale of job dynamics. Our framework is
inspired by serverless platforms such as Knative where servers are software
functions that can be flexibly instantiated in milliseconds according to
scaling rules defined by the users of the serverless platform. The main
question is how to design such scaling rules to minimize user-perceived delay
performance while guaranteeing low energy consumption. For the first time, we
investigate this problem when the auto-scaling and load balancing processes
operate \emph{asynchronously}, as in Knative. One advantage induced by
asynchronism is that jobs do not necessarily need to wait any time a scale-up
decision is taken.
  In our main result, we find a general condition on the structure of scaling
rules able to drive mean-field dynamics to delay and relative energy
optimality, i.e., a situation where both the user-perceived delay and the
relative energy wastage induced by idle servers vanish in the limit where the
network demand grows to infinity in proportion to the nominal service capacity.
The identified condition suggests to scale up the current net capacity if and
only if the mean demand exceeds the rate at which servers become idle and
active.
  Finally, we propose \emph{Rate-Idle}, i.e., a scaling rule that satisfies our
optimality condition, and by means of numerical simulations, we show that it
improves delay performance over existing (synchronous) schemes.

for the timely diagnosis of and favorable outcomes in KD. Moreover, similar to
KD, coronavirus disease 2019, currently causing a worldwide pandemic, also
manifests with fever; therefore, it is crucial at this moment that KD should be
distinguished clearly among the febrile diseases in children. In this study, we
aimed to validate a deep learning algorithm for classification of KD and other

subtypes. The difference in procedures to acquire WSIs at various trial sites
gives rise to variability in the histopathology images, thus making consistent
diagnosis challenging. These differences may stem from variability in image
acquisition through multi-vendor scanners, variable acquisition parameters, and
differences in staining procedure; as well, patient demographics may bias the
glass slide batches before image acquisition. These variabilities are assumed
to cause a domain shift in the images of different hospitals. It is crucial to
overcome this domain shift because an ideal machine-learning model must be able
to work on the diverse sources of images, independent of the acquisition
center. A domain generalization technique is leveraged in this study to improve
the generalization capability of a Deep Neural Network (DNN), to an unseen
histopathology image set (i.e., from an unseen hospital/trial site) in the
presence of domain shift. According to experimental results, the conventional

observe that such algorithms are often less effective under a low-noise or real

that leverages the architectural inductive bias of implicit neural
representations (INRs), based on our two findings: (1) INR tends to fit the
low-frequency clean image signal faster than the high-frequency noise, and (2)
INR layers that are closer to the output play more critical roles in fitting
higher-frequency parts. Building on these observations, we propose a denoising
algorithm that maximizes the innate denoising capability of INRs by penalizing
the growth of deeper layer weights. We show that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot denoising methods under an extensive set of low-noise or

  Design - Development and validation of deep learning models for
classification and feature segmentation.
  Methods - A DL framework was developed consisting of a classification model
and an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection model for the identification of
ungradable scans; a classification model to identify scans with drusen or RPD;
and an image segmentation model to independently segment lesions as RPD or
drusen. Data were obtained from 1284 participants in the UK Biobank (UKBB) with
a self-reported diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 250
UKBB controls. Drusen and RPD were manually delineated by five retina
specialists. The main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, area
under the ROC curve (AUC), kappa, accuracy and intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC).
  Results - The classification models performed strongly at their respective
tasks (0.95, 0.93, and 0.99 AUC, respectively, for the ungradable scans
classifier, the OOD model, and the drusen and RPD classification model). The
mean ICC for drusen and RPD area vs. graders was 0.74 and 0.61, respectively,
compared with 0.69 and 0.68 for intergrader agreement. FROC curves showed that
the model's sensitivity was close to human performance.
  Conclusions - The models achieved high classification and segmentation
performance, similar to human performance. Application of this robust framework
will further our understanding of RPD as a separate entity from drusen in both

contamination on the cosmological signals is extremely severe, and the
systematic effects caused by radio telescopes themselves further aggravate the
difficulties in subtracting foreground. In this work, we investigate whether
the deep learning method, concretely the 3D U-Net algorithm here, can play a
crucial role in foreground subtraction when considering the systematic effect
caused by the telescope's primary beam. We consider two beam models, i.e., the
Gaussian beam model as a simple case and the Cosine beam model as a
sophisticated case. The traditional principal component analysis (PCA) method
is employed as a comparison and, more importantly, as the preprocessing step
for the U-Net method to reduce the sky map dynamic range. We find that in the
case of the Gaussian beam, the PCA method can effectively clean the foreground.
However, the PCA method cannot handle the systematic effect induced by the
Cosine beam, and the additional U-Net method can improve the result
significantly. In order to show how well the PCA and U-Net methods can recover
the HI signals, we also derive the HI angular power spectra, as well as the HI
2D power spectra, after performing the foreground subtractions. It is found
that, in the case of Gaussian beam, the concordance with the original HI map
using U-Net is better than that using PCA by $27.4\%$, and in the case of
Cosine beam, the concordance using U-Net is better than that using PCA by
$144.8\%$. Therefore, the U-Net based foreground subtraction can efficiently
eliminate the telescope primary beam effect and shed new light on recovering
the HI power spectrum for future HI IM experiments.

of the large scale universe. In particular, increasingly accurate cosmological
observations have allowed us to discover a form of ""dark energy"", which

fundamental problems in the standard cosmological model point towards the
possibility of a primordial inflationary period. Both these expansion phases
have in common the fact that they should be governed by forms of energy with
properties much similar to those of vacuum energy of classical or quantum
fields. In the meanwhile, quantum field theory in curved spaces (QFTCS) has
proved a rich framework to analyze phenomena of a quantum nature in regimes
where spacetime curvature is relevant, but not too extreme; particularly, it
yields novel insights on the structure and dynamics of quantum vacuum. In this
dissertation, we make a thorough exposition of the fundamentals of QFTCS and
present some of its applications in cosmological spacetimes. Particular
attention is given to the construction of an empirical notion of particles
through an idealized model of particle detectors, and to the phenomenon of
particle creation in expanding FLRW spacetimes. Further, we develop the
procedure of adiabatic renormalization, and use it to compute the renormalized
stress tensor in these spacetimes. For a noninteracting scalar field in de
Sitter spaces, we find that it takes the form of a cosmological constant,
although a quantitatively self-consistent value with the background expansion
can only be found at Planckian densities. We also present a construction of a
simple inflationary model, driven by a self-interacting classical scalar field,
and show how the quantized fluctuations of this field could give rise to a
nearly scale-invariant power spectrum, like the one that is currently observed

When a ferromagnet-topological insulator-ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure

the adiabatic motion of gapped topological electrons on the two interfaces and
act oppositely on the two ferromagnetic layers, which can excite the exchange
mode where the two ferromagnetic layers precess with a $\pi$-phase difference.
The exchange mode resonance, bearing a much higher frequency than the
ferromagnetic resonance, is accompanied by topological charge pumping, leading
to a sharp peak in electrical admittance at the resonance point. Because the
output current is purely adiabatic while dissipative current vanishes
identically, the proposed voltage-driven exchange resonance entails a
remarkably high mechanical efficiency close to unity, which is impossible in

of each input variable with respect to model response. Then, we propose to
split the training sample set into multiple slices, and invoke Bayes' theorem
to approximate the full likelihood function via a sliced likelihood function,
in which multiple small correlation matrices are utilized to describe the
correlation of the sample set. Additionally, we replace the original
high-dimensional hyper-parameter tuning problem with a low-dimensional
counterpart by learning the relationship between the hyper-parameters and the
global sensitivity indices. Finally, we validate SGE-Kriging by means of
numerical experiments with several benchmarks problems. The results show that
the SGE-Kriging model features an accuracy and robustness that is comparable to
the standard one but comes at much less training costs. The benefits are most
evident in high-dimensional problems.

not in a vacuum. Moreover, the question is how much the environment medium
affects the internal field intensities enhancement in the super-resonance
effect. Based on Mie theory we show for the first time that the presence of the
environment leads to a significant decrease in the intensity of the field in

meaningless without taking into account the environment. However, a greater

method to determine the probability of failure. This method, however, requires
a large number of numerical simulations demanding high computational costs.
This paper explores the efficiency of different machine learning (ML)
algorithms used as surrogate models trained on a limited number of random field
slope stability simulations in predicting the results of large datasets. The MC
data in this paper require only the examination of failure or non-failure,
circumventing the time-consuming calculation of factors of safety. An extensive
dataset is generated, consisting of 120,000 finite difference MC slope
stability simulations incorporating different levels of soil heterogeneity and
anisotropy. The Bagging Ensemble, Random Forest and Support Vector classifiers
are found to be the superior models for this problem amongst 9 different models
and ensemble classifiers. Trained only on 0.47% of data (500 samples), the ML
model can classify the entire 120,000 samples with an accuracy of %85 and AUC
score of %91. The performance of ML methods in classifying the random field
slope stability results generally reduces with higher anisotropy and
heterogeneity of soil. The ML assisted MC reliability analysis proves a robust
stochastic method where errors in the predicted probability of failure using %5
of MC data is only %0.46 in average. The approach reduced the computational
time from 306 days to less than 6 hours.

increase the efficiency of stochastic reliability analyses in geotechnical
engineering. This paper presents a highly efficient ML aided reliability
technique that is able to accurately predict the results of a Monte Carlo (MC)

Comparing the results of the complete MC study and the proposed ML aided
technique, the expected errors of the proposed method are realistically
examined. Circumventing the time-consuming computation of factors of safety for
the training datasets, the proposed technique is more efficient than previous
methods. Different ML models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are presented, optimised and
compared. The effects of the size and type of training and testing datasets are
discussed. The expected errors of the ML predicted probability of failure are
characterised by different levels of soil heterogeneity and anisotropy. Using
only 1% of MC samples to train ML surrogate models, the proposed technique can
accurately predict the probability of failure with mean errors limited to 0.7%.
The proposed technique reduces the computational time required for our study
from 306 days to only 14 hours, providing 500 times higher efficiency.

reason, many machine learning methods for text classification have been
proposed and incorporated into the services of most email providers. However,
optimising text classification algorithms and finding the right tradeoff on
their aggressiveness is still a major research problem.
  We present an updated survey of 12 machine learning text classifiers applied
to a public spam corpus. A new pipeline is proposed to optimise hyperparameter
selection and improve the models' performance by applying specific methods
(based on natural language processing) in the preprocessing stage.
  Our study aims to provide a new methodology to investigate and optimise the
effect of different feature sizes and hyperparameters in machine learning
classifiers that are widely used in text classification problems. The
classifiers are tested and evaluated on different metrics including F-score
(accuracy), precision, recall, and run time. By analysing all these aspects, we
show how the proposed pipeline can be used to achieve a good accuracy towards
spam filtering on the Enron dataset, a widely used public email corpus.
Statistical tests and explainability techniques are applied to provide a robust
analysis of the proposed pipeline and interpret the classification outcomes of
the 12 machine learning models, also identifying words that drive the
classification results. Our analysis shows that it is possible to identify an
effective machine learning model to classify the Enron dataset with an F-score

Here, we investigate the formation of ribose through a simplified version of
the formose reaction inside carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. Following up
on our previous studies regarding nucleobases with the same coupled
physico-chemical model, we calculate the abundance of ribose within
planetesimals of different sizes and heating histories. We perform laboratory
experiments using catalysts present in carbonaceous chondrites to infer the
yield of ribose among all pentoses (5Cs) forming during the formose reaction.
These laboratory yields are used to tune our theoretical model that can only
predict the total abundance of 5Cs. We found that the calculated abundances of
ribose were similar to the ones measured in carbonaceous chondrites. We discuss
the possibilities of chemical decomposition and preservation of ribose and
derived constraints on time and location in planetesimals. In conclusion, the
aqueous formose reaction might produce most of the ribose in carbonaceous
chondrites. Together with our previous studies on nucleobases, we found that
life-building blocks of the RNA world could be synthesized inside parent bodies
and later delivered onto the early Earth.

gain in performance due to a better ranking of the same documents (prioritizing
precision)? On the other hand, what is different? Can it retrieve effectively
documents missed by traditional systems (prioritizing recall)? We discover
substantial differences in the notion of relevance identifying strengths and

assessing driver's safety. In contrast to other physical conditions, such as
short-sight, or manual disability cognitive ability is transient. Safety
regulations attempt to reduce risk related to driver's cognitive ability by
removing risk factors such as alcohol or drug consumption, forbidding secondary
tasks such as texting, and urging drivers to take breaks when feeling tired.
However, one cannot regulate all factors that affect driver's cognition,
furthermore, the driver's momentary cognitive ability in most cases is covert
even to driver.
  Here, we introduce an active approach aiming at monitoring a specific
cognitive process that is affected by all these forementioned causes and
directly affects the driver's performance in the driving task. We lean on the
scientific approach that was framed by Karl Friston (Friston, 2010). We
developed a closed loop-method in which driver's ocular responses to visual
probing were recorded. Machine-learning-algorithms were trained on ocular
responses of vigilant condition and were able to detect decrease in capability
due fatigue and substance abuse. Our results show that we manage to correctly
classify subjects with impaired and unimpaired cognitive process regardless of

and principal component analyses were used to categorize different countries
based on their ability to control the outbreak based on number of cases and

non-parametrical analyses, different variables were correlated with multiple
economic, political, and social indexes. Results: Multiple significant
