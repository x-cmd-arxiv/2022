candidates for fabricating electronic devices and circuits on flexible
substrates. Inks or dispersions of 2D materials can be deposited on flexible
substrates by large-scale coating techniques, such as inkjet printing and spray
coating. One of the main issues in coating processes is nonuniform deposition
of inks, which may lead to large variations of properties across the
substrates. Here, we investigate the role of surface morphology on the
performance of graphene ink deposited on different paper substrates with
specific top coatings. Substrates with good wetting properties result in
reproducible thin films and electrical properties with low sheet resistance.
The correct choice of surface morphology enables high-performance films without
postdeposition annealing or treatment. Scanning terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is introduced to evaluate both the uniformity and the
local conductivity of graphene inks on paper. A paper-based strain gauge is
demonstrated and a variable resistor acts as an on-off switch for operating an
LED. Customized surfaces can thus help in unleashing the full potential of
ink-based 2D materials.

  Summarization","NAACL2022-findings",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success and
become a milestone in NLP, abstractive conversational summarization remains a
challenging but less studied task. The difficulty lies in two aspects. One is
the lack of large-scale conversational summary data. Another is that applying
the existing pre-trained models to this task is tricky because of the
structural dependence within the conversation and its informal expression, etc.
In this work, we first build a large-scale (11M) pretraining dataset called
RCS, based on the multi-person discussions in the Reddit community. We then
present TANet, a thread-aware Transformer-based network. Unlike the existing
pre-trained models that treat a conversation as a sequence of sentences, we
argue that the inherent contextual dependency among the utterances plays an
essential role in understanding the entire conversation and thus propose two
new techniques to incorporate the structural information into our model. The
first is thread-aware attention which is computed by taking into account the
contextual dependency within utterances. Second, we apply thread prediction
loss to predict the relations between utterances. We evaluate our model on four
datasets of real conversations, covering types of meeting transcripts,
customer-service records, and forum threads. Experimental results demonstrate
that TANET achieves a new state-of-the-art in terms of both automatic
evaluation and human judgment.

Finsler geometries is represented by the osculating Finsler spaces, in which
the internal variable is a function of the base manifold coordinates only. In
an osculating Finsler geometry one introduces the Barthel connection, which has
the remarkable property that it is the Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian
metric. In the present work we consider the gravitational and cosmological
implications of a Barthel-Kropina type geometry. We assume that in this
geometry the Ricci type curvatures are related to the matter energy-momentum
tensor by the standard Einstein equations. The generalized Friedmann equations
in the Barthel-Kropina geometry are obtained by considering that the background
Riemannian metric is of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker type. The matter
energy balance equation is also derived. The cosmological properties of the
model are investigated in detail, and it is shown that the model admits a de
Sitter type solution, and that an effective dark energy component can also be
generated. Several cosmological solutions are also obtained by numerically
integrating the generalized Friedmann equations. A comparison of two specific
classes of models with the observational data and with the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model is also performed, and it turns out that the Barthel-Kropina

prove feasibility, we consider the problem of distributed power control for

build a DS-CDMA ns3 module that interacts with the OpenAI Gym environment.
Next, we train the power control DRL agents in this ns3-gym simulation
environment in a scenario that replicates our hardware testbed. Next, for edge
(embedded on-device) deployment, the trained models are optimized for real-time
operation without loss of performance. Hardware-based evaluation verifies the
efficiency of DRL agents over traditional distributed constrained power control

the position estimate. Consequently, the placement of the UWB radios must be
carefully designed to provide satisfactory localization accuracy for a region
of interest. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that optimizes the UWB

optimization problem that balances the influence of the geometry of the radio

compute a minimal number of UWB radios required for a desired localization

method previously developed for asymptotically flat spacetimes whose metric
functions have integer-power asymptotic expansions to the case that may or may
not be asymptotically flat but with non-integer power expansions. It is found
that in the asymptotically flat case ($-1/3<\omega<0$) the deflection angles

$M/b,~b/r_{s,d}$ and $\alpha/M^{1+3\omega}$ where $M,~b,~r_{s,d}$ are

asymptotically flat (or non-flat) case, the increase of $\alpha$ or decrease of

deflection angles naturally take into account the finite distance effect of the

equation, from which the apparent angles of the images and their magnifications

lost for any positive storage capacity. It is shown that this comes about
because of the spherical symmetry of the free energy in the Gaussian case.
Introducing two different memory pattern overlaps between spin configurations

observe that the Gaussian parts of the patterns act as a noise, making
retrieval more difficult. The basins of attraction of the states, the accuracy
of the retrieval and the storage capacity are studied by means of Monte Carlo

challenges, we propose a knowledge-free black-box watermarking scheme for image
classification neural networks. The image generator obtained from a data-free
distillation process is leveraged to stabilize the network's performance during
the backdoor injection. A delicate encoding and verification protocol is
designed to ensure the scheme's security against knowledgable adversaries. We
also give a pioneering analysis of the capacity of the watermarking scheme.
Experiment results proved the functionality-preserving capability and security
of the proposed watermarking scheme.

emitted by spinning neutron stars located in the inner parsecs of the Galactic
Center (GC). Compelling evidence for the presence of a numerous population of
neutron stars has been reported in the literature, turning this region into a
very interesting place to look for CWs. In this search, data from the full O3
LIGO--Virgo run in the detector frequency band $[10,2000]\rm~Hz$ have been
used. No significant detection was found and 95$\%$ confidence level upper
limits on the signal strain amplitude were computed, over the full search band,
with the deepest limit of about $7.6\times 10^{-26}$ at $\simeq 142\rm~Hz$.
These results are significantly more constraining than those reported in
previous searches. We use these limits to put constraints on the fiducial
neutron star ellipticity and r-mode amplitude. These limits can be also
translated into constraints in the black hole mass -- boson mass plane for a
hypothetical population of boson clouds around spinning black holes located in
the GC.

storage and are, for example, used as lithium-battery electrodes,
hydrogen-storage compounds, and electrochromic materials. An important issue
preventing the more widespread use of these materials is that they undergo
structural transformations (of up to ~10% lattice strains) during
intercalation, which expand the material, nucleate microcracks, and,
ultimately, lead to material failure. Besides the structural transformation of
lattices, the crystallographic texture of the intercalation material plays a
key role in governing ion-transport properties, generating phase separation
microstructures, and elastically interacting with crystal defects. In this
review, I provide an overview of how the structural transformation of lattices,
phase transformation microstructures, and crystallographic defects affect the
chemo-mechanical properties of intercalation materials. In each section, I
identify the key challenges and opportunities to crystallographically design
intercalation compounds to improve their properties and lifespans. I
predominantly cite examples from the literature of intercalation cathodes used
in rechargeable batteries, however, the identified challenges and opportunities
are transferable to a broader range of intercalation compounds.

the signal to noise ratio ({\Delta}SNR) and ii) Percentage reduction in motion
artifacts ({\eta}). The proposed WPD-based single-stage motion artifacts
correction technique produces the highest average {\Delta}SNR (29.44 dB) when
db2 wavelet packet is incorporated whereas the greatest average {\eta} (53.48%)
is obtained using db1 wavelet packet for all the available 23 EEG recordings.
Our proposed two-stage motion artifacts correction technique i.e. the WPD-CCA
method utilizing db1 wavelet packet has shown the best denoising performance
producing an average {\Delta}SNR and {\eta} values of 30.76 dB and 59.51%,

microscopy (ULM) has received much attention. However, ULM relies on low
concentrations of microbubbles in the blood vessels, ultimately resulting in
long acquisition times. Here, we present an alternative super-resolution
approach, based on direct deconvolution of single-channel ultrasound
radio-frequency (RF) signals with a one-dimensional dilated convolutional
neural network (CNN). This work focuses on low-frequency ultrasound (1.7 MHz)
for deep imaging (10 cm) of a dense cloud of monodisperse microbubbles (up to
1000 microbubbles in the measurement volume, corresponding to an average echo
overlap of 94%). Data are generated with a simulator that uses a large range of
acoustic pressures (5-250 kPa) and captures the full, nonlinear response of
resonant, lipid-coated microbubbles. The network is trained with a novel
dual-loss function, which features elements of both a classification loss and a
regression loss and improves the detection-localization characteristics of the
output. Whereas imposing a localization tolerance of 0 yields poor detection
metrics, imposing a localization tolerance corresponding to 4% of the
wavelength yields a precision and recall of both 0.90. Furthermore, the
detection improves with increasing acoustic pressure and deteriorates with
increasing microbubble density. The potential of the presented approach to
super-resolution ultrasound imaging is demonstrated with a delay-and-sum
reconstruction with deconvolved element data. The resulting image shows an

that leverages an in-home hub to pre-process and minimize outgoing data in a
structured and enforceable manner before sending it to external cloud servers.
Peekaboo's key innovations are (1) abstracting common data pre-processing
functionality into a small and fixed set of chainable operators, and (2)
requiring that developers explicitly declare desired data collection behaviors
(e.g., data granularity, destinations, conditions) in an application manifest,
which also specifies how the operators are chained together. Given a manifest,
Peekaboo assembles and executes a pre-processing pipeline using operators
pre-loaded on the hub. In doing so, developers can collect smart home data on a
need-to-know basis; third-party auditors can verify data collection behaviors;
and the hub itself can offer a number of centralized privacy features to users
across apps and devices, without additional effort from app developers. We
present the design and implementation of Peekaboo, along with an evaluation of
its coverage of smart home scenarios, system performance, data minimization,

Broglie's, that matter is fundamentally a wave phenomenon whose particle
aspects are revealed by quantum mechanics. Their quantum mechanical description
is derived through the introduction of a matter vector potential, having
frequency $\omega_0$, to Schrodinger's equation for a massive particle. Maxwell
matter waves are then seen to be coherent excitations of a single-mode of the
matter-wave field. In the classical regime, their mechanics is captured by a
matter analog of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field. As such,
Maxwell matter waves enable a spectrum of systems that have useful optical
analogs, such as resonant matter-wave interferometric sensors and matter-wave
parametric oscillators. These waves are associated with a wavelength that is
tied to the drive frequency $\omega_0$ rather than to the massive particle's
energy, as is ordinarily the case with de Broglie matter waves. As a result,
simple interferometric measurements lead to different outcomes for the two
types of waves. While their apparent departure from de Broglie character is
surprising, Maxwell matter waves are wholly consistent with quantum mechanics.

our attention on the simplest granular system composed by a single magnetized
spherical particle allocated in a quasi one-dimensional circular channel that
receives energy from a magnetic field reservoir and transduces it into a
running and tumbling motion. The theoretical analysis based on the run and
tumble model on a circle of radius R forecasts the existence of a dynamical
phase transition between an erratic motion (disordered phase) when the
characteristic persistence length of the run and tumble motion, $\ell_{c} <
R/2$, to a persistent motion (ordered phase) when $\ell_{c}> R/2$. It is found
that the limiting behaviours of these phases correspond to a Brownian motion on
the circle and a simple uniform circular motion, respectively. It is
qualitatively shown that the lower magnetization of a particle, the larger
persistence lenght is. It is so at least within the experimental limit of

Integrating out the new states yields a single $d=6$ operator, which induces a

Fermi constant from muon decay and increases the prediction for $M_W$, in line
with the CDF II result. Non-unitarity of the PMNS matrix would also affect

explained without conflicting with lepton flavour universality constraints or
the invisible decay width of the $Z$. However, the so-called Cabibbo angle

depends on molecular motion over distances of the order of 1-2 nm. From the
concentration dependence of the excimer photoemission curve, it is possible to
derive a value for the lipid self-diffusion coefficient. This technique has
been intensively used in the past twenty years, leading to rather large
numerical values for self-diffusion compared with other approaches based on
fluorescent probes tracking. In most cases, the interpretation of the
experimental data rely on models for diffusion limited 2d reaction rates, or
comparison with 2d lattice random walks. Our approach uses realistic molecular
dynamics trajectories to reinterpret these experiments. Based on a well
established coarse-grained model for lipid MD simulations (Martini), we show
how to relate simulation results to experimental data on excimer formation. Our
procedure is quite general and is applicable to all diffusion-limited kinetic
processes. Key to our approach is the determination of the acceleration factor
of lipid coarse-grained numerical models compared to reality. We find a
significant reduction of the diffusion coefficient values, in particular when
interleaflet association is taken into account. Our work does not point to
deviation from a diffusion-limited mechanism but indicates that the excimer
formation across bilayer leaflets could be hindered.

illumination numbers of $2$-illuminable spiky balls as well as centrally

components (known as packages) has grown rapidly. Identifying high-quality and
well-maintained packages from a large pool of packages to depend on is a basic
and important problem, as it is beneficial for various applications, such as
package recommendation and package search. However, no systematic and
comprehensive work focuses on addressing this problem except in online
discussions or informal literature and interviews. To fill this gap, in this
paper, we conducted a mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis to understand
how developers identify and select relevant open source packages. In
particular, we started by surveying 118 JavaScript developers from the npm
ecosystem to qualitatively understand the factors that make a package to be
highly-selected within the npm ecosystem. The survey results showed that
JavaScript developers believe that highly-selected packages are
well-documented, receive a high number of stars on GitHub, have a large number
of downloads, and do not suffer from vulnerabilities. Then, we conducted an
experiment to quantitatively validate the developers' perception of the factors
that make a highly-selected package. In this analysis, we collected and mined
historical data from 2,527 packages divided into highly-selected and not
highly-selected packages. For each package in the dataset, we collected
quantitative data to present the factors studied in the developers' survey.
Next, we used regression analysis to quantitatively investigate which of the
studied factors are the most important. Our regression analysis complements our
survey results about highly-selected packages. In particular, the results
showed that highly-selected packages tend to be correlated by the number of
downloads, stars, and how large the package's readme file is.

in denser environments, and the fraction of galaxies with star formation (SF)
activity and atomic hydrogen (HI) gas decreases with increasing void-centric

(halo) mass, we compare inner void galaxies to subsamples of fixed stellar
(halo) mass. Compared to denser environments, inner void galaxies with $M_{*}=
10^{[9.0-9.5]}M_\odot$ have comparable SF activity and HI gas fractions, but
the lowest quenched galaxy fraction. Inner void galaxies with $M_{*}=

galaxies with $M_{*}>10^{10.5}M_\odot$ have comparable SF activity and HI gas
fractions to their analogues in denser environments. They retain the highest
metallicity gas that might be linked to physical processes that act with lower
efficiency in underdense regions, such as AGN feedback. Furthermore, inner void

examples are given for each new task. One of the effective research lines to
address this challenge focuses on learning deep representations driven by a
similarity measure between a query image and few support images of some class.
Statistically, this amounts to measure the dependency of image features, viewed
as random vectors in a high-dimensional embedding space. Previous methods
either only use marginal distributions without considering joint distributions,
suffering from limited representation capability, or are computationally
expensive though harnessing joint distributions. In this paper, we propose a
deep Brownian Distance Covariance (DeepBDC) method for few-shot classification.
The central idea of DeepBDC is to learn image representations by measuring the
discrepancy between joint characteristic functions of embedded features and
product of the marginals. As the BDC metric is decoupled, we formulate it as a
highly modular and efficient layer. Furthermore, we instantiate DeepBDC in two
different few-shot classification frameworks. We make experiments on six
standard few-shot image benchmarks, covering general object recognition,
fine-grained categorization and cross-domain classification. Extensive
evaluations show our DeepBDC significantly outperforms the counterparts, while
establishing new state-of-the-art results. The source code is available at

recover a large fraction of the pedigree structure and genetic content by an

2 generations. We claim that this is due to the inbreeding present in any
setting where the algorithm can be run, even on simulated data. To support the
claim we show that a main step of the algorithm, called ancestral
reconstruction, performs accurately in a idealized setting with no inbreeding
but performs poorly in random mating populations.
  To overcome the poor behavior of REC-GEN we introduce a Belief-Propagation

cosmological-scale axis. This paper analyzes and compares 10 different datasets
published in the past decade, collected by SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and Hubble Space

direction, and the distribution can show dipole axes. The analysis shows that
the directions of the most probable dipole axes are consistent in datasets that
have similar average redshift, but different between datasets that have
different average redshift. The analysis also shows that the location of the
most probable axis correlates with the average redshift of the galaxies in the
datasets. That is, the location of the most probable axis shifts when the
redshift gets higher, and the correlation is statistically significant. This
provides a certain indication of a drift in a possible axis formed by the
distribution of galaxy spin directions, or a cosmological scale structure that
peaks at a certain distance from Earth.

algorithm is based on the Measurement Equation framework, which forms the basis
of all modern radio interferometric calibration and imaging. It delivers high
dynamic range and fidelity full Stokes solar radio images with instrumental
polarization leakages $<1\%$, on par with general astronomical radio imaging,
and represents the state-of-the-art. Opening up this rewarding, yet unexplored,
phase space will enable multiple novel science investigations and offer
considerable discovery potential. Examples include detection of low-level of
circularly polarization from thermal coronal emission to estimate large-scale
quiescent coronal fields; polarization of faint gyrosynchrotron emissions from
coronal mass ejections for robust estimation of plasma parameters; and
detection of the first-ever linear polarization at these frequencies. This

high fidelity spectro-polarimetric snapshot solar imaging at low-radio

of ""pitch"" in phonetic analysis. But there have been many demonstrations that
F0 is at best an approximation to pitch, both in production and in perception:
pitch is not F0, and F0 is not pitch. Changes in the pitch involve many
articulatory and acoustic covariates; pitch perception often deviates from what
F0 analysis predicts; and in fact, quasi-periodic signals from a single voice
source are often incompletely characterized by an attempt to define a single
time-varying F0. In this paper, we find strong support for the existence of
covariates for pitch in aspects of relatively coarse spectra, in which an
overtone series is not available. Thus linear regression can predict the pitch
of simple vocalizations, produced by an articulatory synthesizer or by human,
from single frames of such coarse spectra. Across speakers, and in more complex
vocalizations, our experiments indicate that the covariates are not quite so
simple, though apparently still available for more sophisticated modeling. On
this basis, we propose that the field needs a better way of thinking about
speech pitch, just as celestial mechanics requires us to go beyond Newton's
point mass approximations to heavenly bodies.

knowledge intensive tasks. Rather than relying purely on latent semantics
within the parameters of large neural models, these methods enlist a
semi-parametric memory to encode an index of knowledge for the model to
retrieve over. Most prior work has employed text passages as the unit of
knowledge, which has high coverage at the cost of interpretability,
controllability, and efficiency. The opposite properties arise in other methods
which have instead relied on knowledge base (KB) facts. At the same time, more
recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of storing and retrieving from
an index of Q-A pairs derived from text \citep{lewis2021paq}. This approach
yields a high coverage knowledge representation that maintains KB-like
properties due to its representations being more atomic units of information.
In this work we push this line of research further by proposing a
question-answer augmented encoder-decoder model and accompanying pretraining
strategy. This yields an end-to-end system that not only outperforms prior QA
retrieval methods on single-hop QA tasks but also enables compositional
reasoning, as demonstrated by strong performance on two multi-hop QA datasets.
Together, these methods improve the ability to interpret and control the model

that the information paradox arises in quasi-dS space with the monotonically
increasing horizon size which is used to describe the inflationary cosmology.
For this purpose, the dimensional reduction of three-dimensional dS space with
thermal radiation modelled by the JT gravity coupled to CFT is considered. We
argue that when the central charge monotonically increases in time, the

become more restrictive. As the central charge can be interpreted as the number
of degrees of freedom, the absence of the island in quasi-dS space supports the

therefore necessary to understand the mechanisms that drive epidemic outbreaks
in non-endemic regions, to help in the design of control strategies. We develop
a stochastic model that includes climate variables, social structure, and
mobility between a non-endemic city and an endemic area. We choose as a case
study the non-endemic city of San Ram{\'o}n de la Nueva Or{\'a}n, located in
Northwest Argentina. Human mobility is intense through the border with Bolivia,
where dengue transmission is sustained during the whole year. City population
was modelled as a meta-population taking into account households and population
data for each patch. Climate variability was considered by including rainfall,
relative humidity and temperature time series into the models. Those climatic
variables were input of a mosquito population ecological model, which in turn
is coupled to an epidemiological model. Different hypotheses regarding people's
mobility between an endemic and non-endemic area are tested, taking into
account the local climatic variation, typical of the non-endemic city.
Simulations are qualitatively consistent with weekly clinical data reported
from 2009 to 2016. Our model results allow to explain the observed pattern of
outbreaks, that alternates large dengue epidemics and several years with
smaller outbreaks. We found that the number of vectors per host and an
effective reproductive number are proxies for large epidemics, both related
with climate variability such as rainfall and temperature, opening the
possibility to test these meteorological variables for forecast purposes.

  Let $G$ be a Polish group. (1) $G$ is a discrete countable group containing

However, a natural question is ignored: can the hidden states be directly used

testing, the data can be highly sensitive and may require privacy protection;
for example, sequential hypothesis testing is used in clinical trials, where
doctors sequentially collect data from patients and must determine when to stop

strong privacy guarantees, and has been commonly applied to machine learning

  In this work, we study the sequential hypothesis testing problem under a
slight variant of differential privacy, known as Renyi differential privacy. We
present a new private algorithm based on Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio

theoretical analysis on statistical performance measured by Type I and Type II

theoretical results on several synthetic databases, showing that our algorithms
also perform well in practice. Unlike previous work in private hypothesis
testing that focused only on the classical fixed sample setting, our results in

saving the cost of collecting additional samples.

  species","16 pages, 10 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Understanding the coexistence of diverse species in a changing environment is
an important problem in community ecology. Bet-hedging is a strategy that helps
species survive in such changing environments. However, studies of bet-hedging
have often focused on the expected long-term growth rate of the species by
itself, neglecting competition with other coexisting species. Here we study the
extinction risk of a bet-hedging species in competition with others. We show
that there are three contributions to the extinction risk. The first is the
usual demographic fluctuation due to stochastic reproduction and selection
processes in finite populations. The second, due to the fluctuation of
population growth rate caused by environmental changes, may counterintuitively
reduce the extinction risk for small populations. Besides those two, we reveal
a third contribution, which is unique to bet-hedging species that diversify
into multiple phenotypes: The phenotype composition of the population will
fluctuate over time, resulting in increased extinction risk. We compare such
compositional fluctuation to the demographic and environmental contributions,
showing how they have different effects on the extinction risk depending on the
population size, generation overlap, and environmental correlation.

architectures are based on computing a balanced partitioning via sampling and

rounds required. Histogramming (computing positions of samples) guides
sampling, enabling a decrease in the overall number of samples collected. We
derive lower and upper bounds on the number of sampling/histogramming rounds
required to compute a balanced partitioning. We improve on prior results to
demonstrate that when using $p$ processors, $O(\log^* p)$ rounds with
$O(p/\log^* p)$ samples per round suffice. We match that with a lower bound
that shows that any algorithm with $O(p)$ samples per round requires at least
$\Omega(\log^* p)$ rounds. Additionally, we prove the $\Omega(p \log p)$

To derive the lower bound, we propose a hard randomized input distribution and

these mechanisms, neurons with hybrid synaptic interaction in a balanced
neuronal networks have been recently put forward. Here we show that both
synaptic noise intensity and excitatory weights can make a greater contribution
than variance of synaptic noise to the coexistence of firing states with slight
modification parameters. The resulting statistical analysis of both voltage

time-varying multistability as a format of metstable state has been observed
under suitable parameters settings of noise intensity and excitatory synaptic

coexistence of synchrony state and metastable (or asynchronous firing state)

following question: how do we invert the data generation process to extract
those factors with minimal or no supervision? Several works in the literature
on non-linear independent component analysis have established this negative
result; without some knowledge of the data generation process or appropriate
inductive biases, it is impossible to perform this inversion. In recent years,
a lot of progress has been made on disentanglement under structural
assumptions, e.g., when we have access to auxiliary information that makes the
factors of variation conditionally independent. However, existing work requires
a lot of auxiliary information, e.g., in supervised classification, it
prescribes that the number of label classes should be at least equal to the
total dimension of all factors of variation. In this work, we depart from these
assumptions and ask: a) How can we get disentanglement when the auxiliary
information does not provide conditional independence over the factors of
variation? b) Can we reduce the amount of auxiliary information required for
disentanglement? For a class of models where auxiliary information does not
ensure conditional independence, we show theoretically and experimentally that
disentanglement (to a large extent) is possible even when the auxiliary

Existing methods typically focus on modeling relationship between different

these segments; however, these approaches do not explicitly consider the
contextual dependency within individual segments. To this end, we propose to
learn pixel-level distinctions to improve the video highlight detection. This
pixel-level distinction indicates whether or not each pixel in one video
belongs to an interesting section. The advantages of modeling such fine-level
distinctions are two-fold. First, it allows us to exploit the temporal and
spatial relations of the content in one video, since the distinction of a pixel
in one frame is highly dependent on both the content before this frame and the
content around this pixel in this frame. Second, learning the pixel-level
distinction also gives a good explanation to the video highlight task regarding
what contents in a highlight segment will be attractive to people. We design an
encoder-decoder network to estimate the pixel-level distinction, in which we
leverage the 3D convolutional neural networks to exploit the temporal context
information, and further take advantage of the visual saliency to model the
spatial distinction. State-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks

The magnitude of each velocity gradient is different, reflecting that each line

with the single-dimensional edge feature and failed to utilise the rich edge

Edge-enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks) for semi-supervised text
classification. A text graph for an entire corpus is firstly constructed to
describe the undirected and multi-dimensional relationship of word-to-word,
document-document, and word-to-document. The graph is initialised with
corpus-trained multi-dimensional word and document node representation, and the
relations are represented according to the distance of those words/documents
nodes. Then, the generated graph is trained with ME-GCN, which considers the
edge features as multi-stream signals, and each stream performs a separate
graph convolutional operation. Our ME-GCN can integrate a rich source of graph
edge information of the entire text corpus. The results have demonstrated that
our proposed model has significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods

recommendations made by an RS, e.g., movie recommendations on Netflix or books
to read on Amazon. This, in turn, requires continuous training of the RS to
cope with both the online fashion of data and the changing nature of user

address three requirements: continuous training and recommendation, handling
concept drifts, and ability to scale. Streaming recommender systems proposed in
the literature mostly, address the first two requirements and do not consider
scalability. That is because they run the training process on a single machine.

areas in remote sensing (RS) that needs to be carefully addressed in different
RS applications. Despite the high spectral resolution of the hyperspectral
data, the relatively low spatial resolution of the sensors may lead to mixture
of different pure materials within the image pixels. In this case, the spectrum
of a given pixel recorded by the sensor can be a combination of multiple
spectra each belonging to a unique material in that pixel. Spectral unmixing is
then used as a technique to extract the spectral characteristics of the
different materials within the mixed pixels and to recover the spectrum of each
pure spectral signature, called endmember. Block-sparsity exists in
hyperspectral images as a result of spectral similarity between neighboring
pixels. In block-sparse signals, the nonzero samples occur in clusters and the
pattern of the clusters is often supposed to be unavailable as prior
information. This paper presents an innovative spectral unmixing approach for
HSIs based on block-sparse structure. Hyperspectral unmixing problem is solved
using pattern coupled sparse Bayesian learning strategy (PCSBL). To evaluate
the performance of the proposed SU algorithm, it is tested on both synthetic
and real hyperspectral data and the quantitative results are compared to those
of other state-of-the-art methods in terms of abundance angle distance and mean

the core of probabilistic and causal modeling. The NoTears approach of (Zheng

exponential trace $\mathrm{tr}(\exp(\cdot))$, opens up a way to learning DAGs
via continuous optimization, though with a $O(d^3)$ complexity in the number
$d$ of nodes. This paper presents a low-complexity model, called LoRAM for
Low-Rank Additive Model, which combines low-rank matrix factorization with a
sparsification mechanism for the continuous optimization of DAGs. The main
contribution of the approach lies in an efficient gradient approximation method
leveraging the low-rank property of the model, and its straightforward
application to the computation of projections from graph matrices onto the DAG
matrix space. The proposed method achieves a reduction from a cubic complexity
to quadratic complexity while handling the same DAG characteristic function as
NoTears, and scales easily up to thousands of nodes for the projection problem.
The experiments show that the LoRAM achieves efficiency gains of orders of

accuracy loss in the considered range of sparse matrices, and with a low
sensitivity to the rank choice of the model's low-rank component.

Intra-modal Denoising Auto-Encoding (IDAE), which is able to reconstruct input
text (audio) representations from a noisy version of itself. (2) Cross-modal
Denoising Auto-Encoding (CDAE), which is pre-trained to reconstruct the input

corresponding translated noisy audio features (text embeddings). (3) Iterative
Denoising Process (IDP), which iteratively translates raw audio (text) and the
corresponding text embeddings (audio features) translated from previous
iteration into the new less-noisy text embeddings (audio features). We adapt a
dual cross-modal Transformer as our backbone model which consists of two

Nevertheless, the magnetic order is fragile and can be completely suppressed by
applying an external magnetic field. Here, we explore the evolution of magnetic
excitations of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under an in-plane magnetic field, by carrying
out inelastic neutron scattering measurements on high-quality single crystals.
Under zero field, there exist spin-wave excitations near the $M$ point and a
continuum near the $\mit\Gamma$ point, which are believed to be associated with
the zigzag magnetic order and fractional excitations of the Kitaev QSL state,
respectively. By increasing the magnetic field, the spin-wave excitations
gradually give way to the continuous excitations. On the verge of the critical
field $\mu_0H_{\rm c}=7.5$ T, the former vanish and only the latter is left,
indicating the emergence of a pure QSL state. By further increasing the field
strength, the excitations near the $\mit\Gamma$ point become more intense. By
following the gap evolution of the excitations near the $\mit\Gamma$ point, we
are able to establish a phase diagram composed of three interesting phases,
including a gapped zigzag order phase at low fields, possibly-gapless QSL phase
near $\mu_0H_{\rm c}$, and gapped partially polarized phase at high fields.

LaAlO$_3$/EuTiO$_3$/Sr$_{0.99}$Ca$_{0.01}$TiO$_3$ heterostructure. We find that
the electrons at the interface experience magnetic scattering appearing along
with a diverging Curie-Weiss-type behaviour in the EuTiO$_3$ layer. The 2DES is
also affected by the switchable ferroelectric polarization at the
Sr$_{0.99}$Ca$_{0.01}$TiO$_3$ bulk. While the 2DES interacts with both
magnetism and ferroelectricity, we show that the presence of the conducting
electrons has no effect on magnetization in the EuTiO$_3$ layer. Our results
provide a first step towards realizing a new multiferroic system where
magnetism and ferroelectricity can interact via an intermediate conducting
layer.

degradation. To alleviate the extensive human labors and boost the restoration
efficiency, UAV is promising for its fully automatic capability yet still waits
to be exploited. This paper progresses this emerging technology by explicitly
considering the realistic constraints of the UAV and the grassland degradation
while planning the grassland restoration. To this end, the UAV-enabled
restoration process is first mathematically modeled as the maximization of
restoration areas of the UAV under the limited battery energy of UAV, the grass
seeds weight, the number of restored areas, and the corresponding sizes. Then
we analyze that, by considering these constraints, this original problem
emerges two conflict objectives, namely the shortest flight path and the
optimal areas allocation. As a result, the maximization of restoration areas
turns out to be a composite of a trajectory design problem and an areas
allocation problem that are highly coupled. From the perspective of
optimization, this requires solving two NP-hard problems of both the traveling
salesman problem (TSP) and the multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) at the
same time. To tackle this complex problem, we propose a cooperative
optimization algorithm, called CHAPBILM, to solve those two problems
interlacedly by utilizing the interdependencies between them. Multiple
simulations verify the conflicts between the trajectory design and areas
allocation. The effectiveness of the cooperative optimization algorithm is also
supported by the comparisons with traditional optimization methods which do not
utilize the interdependencies between the two problems. As a result, the
proposed algorithm successfully solves the multiple simulation instances in a
near-optimal way.

pixel-wise operations which are suitable to ideal imaging conditions. Our
approach, termed NAN, leverages inter-view and spatial information in NeRFs to
better deal with noise. It achieves state-of-the-art results in burst denoising
and is especially successful in coping with large movement and occlusions,
under very high levels of noise. With the rapid advances in accelerating NeRFs,
it could provide a powerful platform for denoising in challenging environments.

observing the human behind the steering wheel leads to more intuitive
human-vehicle-interaction and safer driving, it requires recognition algorithms
which do not only predict the correct driver state, but also determine their
prediction quality through realistic and interpretable confidence measures.
Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for building trust and are a serious
obstacle for deploying activity recognition networks in real driving systems.
In this work, we for the first time examine how well the confidence values of
modern driver observation models indeed match the probability of the correct
outcome and show that raw neural network-based approaches tend to significantly
overestimate their prediction quality. To correct this misalignment between the
confidence values and the actual uncertainty, we consider two strategies.
First, we enhance two activity recognition models often used for driver
observation with temperature scaling-an off-the-shelf method for confidence
calibration in image classification. Then, we introduce Calibrated Action
Recognition with Input Guidance (CARING)-a novel approach leveraging an
additional neural network to learn scaling the confidences depending on the

demonstrate that both strategies drastically improve the quality of model

that enables clients to jointly train a global model. In real-world FL
implementations, client data could have label noise, and different clients
could have vastly different label noise levels. Although there exist methods in
centralized learning for tackling label noise, such methods do not perform well
on heterogeneous label noise in FL settings, due to the typically smaller sizes
of client datasets and data privacy requirements in FL. In this paper, we
propose $\texttt{FedCorr}$, a general multi-stage framework to tackle
heterogeneous label noise in FL, without making any assumptions on the noise
models of local clients, while still maintaining client data privacy. In
particular, (1) $\texttt{FedCorr}$ dynamically identifies noisy clients by
exploiting the dimensionalities of the model prediction subspaces independently
measured on all clients, and then identifies incorrect labels on noisy clients
based on per-sample losses. To deal with data heterogeneity and to increase
training stability, we propose an adaptive local proximal regularization term
that is based on estimated local noise levels. (2) We further finetune the
global model on identified clean clients and correct the noisy labels for the
remaining noisy clients after finetuning. (3) Finally, we apply the usual
training on all clients to make full use of all local data. Experiments
conducted on CIFAR-10/100 with federated synthetic label noise, and on a
real-world noisy dataset, Clothing1M, demonstrate that $\texttt{FedCorr}$ is
robust to label noise and substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple noise levels.

active for longer than their early type counterparts. While the TESS light

rotation, TESS systematics are not well enough understood for confident
measurements of rotation periods ($P_{\mathrm{rot}}$) longer than half the

with the CNN based on Convoluted Pattern of Wavelet Transform (CPWT) feature

Initially, the image frame gets normalized by applying median filter to the

edge information represents the boundary region of bright spot in the image
frame. Neural network-based image frame classification performs repeated
learning of the feature with minimum training of dataset to cluster the image

multiple-output (MIMO) transmission scheme, referred to as \emph{cache-aided
massive MIMO}, for multi-cell downlink transmission to multiple cache-enabled
receivers. With the proposed scheme, users who have cached (a portion of) the
files that they request are offloaded and, hence, (partially) inactive during
downlink transmission. The other users either benefit from the cache-enabled
offloading for mitigating pilot contamination or exploit the cached but
unrequested files to cancel interference during uplink channel estimation and
downlink file reception. Moreover, by redesigning the transmit precoders based
on the cache status of the users and channel state information, we gain
additional degrees of freedom for massive MIMO transmission. For a given cache
status, we analyze the equivalent content delivery rates (ECDRs), i.e., the
average rates of delivering a requested file via both caching and massive MIMO
transmission to the requesting user, for cache-aided massive MIMO employing
re-designed maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, and
regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. Based on the derived results, the
impact of (random) uncoded caching and coded caching on the performance of the
re-designed precoding schemes is investigated. Simulation results validate our
derivations and show that caching is beneficial for precoded downlink
transmission as it enhances the transmit power allocation, mitigates intra- and
inter-cell interference, and reduces the impairment caused by pilot
contamination. Compared with conventional massive MIMO without caching and with
cache-oblivious precoding, the proposed cache-aided massive MIMO scheme
achieves a significantly higher ECDR even when the number of users approaches
the number of transmit antennas.

excluded, and the Bino-dominated neutralino DM has to co-annihilate with the
Wino-dominated electroweakinos (in most cases) and/or Smuons (in few cases) to
obtain the correct density. It is also inferred that these conclusions should

of the baffles is shown to substantially increase the divertor neutral pressure
for a given upstream density and to facilitate the access to detachment, an
effect that increases with plasma current. The detailed, 2D probe measurements
allow for a divertor particle balance, including ion flux contributions from
parallel flows and ExB drifts. The poloidal flux contribution from the latter
is often comparable or even larger than the former, such that the divertor
parallel flow direction reverses in some conditions, pointing away from the
target. In most conditions, the integrated particle flux at the outer target
can be predominantly ascribed to ionization along the outer divertor leg,
consistent with a closed-box approximation of the divertor. The exception is a
strongly detached divertor, achieved here only with baffles, where the total
poloidal ion flux even decreases towards the outer target, indicative of
significant plasma recombination. The most striking observation from relative
density fluctuation measurements along the outer divertor leg is the transition
from poloidally uniform fluctuation levels in attached conditions to

information about molecular, atomic or nuclear constituents of the sample of
interest. While scattered light carries both amplitude and phase information of
the electromagnetic field, most of the time the latter is lost in intensity
measurements. However, often the phase information is paramount to reconstruct
the desired information of the target, as it is well known from coherent x-ray
imaging. Here we introduce a new phase retrieval algorithm which allows us to
reconstruct the field phase information from two-dimensional time- and
energy-resolved spectra. We apply this method to the particular case of x-ray
scattering off M\""ossbauer nuclei at a synchrotron radiation source. Knowledge
of the phase allows also for an excellent reconstruction of the energy spectra
from experimental data, which could not be achieved with this resolution
otherwise. Our approach provides an efficient novel data analysis tool which
will benefit x-ray quantum optics and M\""ossbauer spectroscopy with synchrotron
radiation alike.

relatively slow pace. It went through mythological descriptions, religious
beliefs, metaphysical worldviews and cosmological models with a mechanistic
structure, until it reached the Newtonian perception of the infinite and
homogeneous three-dimensional continuum, which dominates to this day as a
""common perception"" even in education. This perception of space, which today
seems self-evident, is the culmination of a long historical development, which
we will try to outline. Our aim is to briefly present the conceptual course of
models related to natural space from antiquity to the 20th century, focusing on
the theories and models that can be mathematized. At the same time we try to
highlight one of the most important starting points of geometric concepts,
which is the need for mathematical modeling of physical space, as in modern
education there is no such view.

availability of high bandwidth Internet. Digital images are easy to tamper with
good or bad intentions. Non-availability of pre-embedded information in digital
images makes the tampering detection process more difficult in case of digital
forensics. Thus, passive image tampering is difficult to detect. There are
various algorithms available for detecting image tampering. However, these
algorithms have some drawbacks, due to which all types of tampering cannot be
detected. In this paper researchers intend to present the types of image
tampering and its detection techniques with example based approach. This paper
also illustrates insights into the various existing algorithms and tries to
find out efficient algorithm out of them.

In this
work we discuss the potential consequences on existential risk for humanity.
Even with the timeline for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing still
unclear, it is highly likely that quantum computers will eventually realize an
exponential speedup for certain practical applications. We identify quantum
simulation as the most relevant application in this regard and we qualitatively
outline different risk trajectories. Both amplifying and mitigating effects of
quantum computing for existential risk are anticipated. In order to prevent
quantum computing from being an amplifier of existential risk, we call for
increased efforts by the scientific community towards reducing potential future
quantum risk. This viewpoint seeks to add a new perspective to the discussion
on technological risk of quantum computing.
