  fixed-rank constraints: an extended version",,,,,"math.OC cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider smooth optimization problems with a Hermitian positive
semi-definite fixed-rank constraint, where a quotient geometry with three
Riemannian metrics $g^i(\cdot, \cdot)$ $(i=1,2,3)$ is used to represent this
constraint. By taking the nonlinear conjugate gradient method (CG) as an
example, we show that CG on the quotient geometry with metric $g^1$ is
equivalent to CG on the factor-based optimization framework, which is often
called the Burer--Monteiro approach. We also show that CG on the quotient
geometry with metric $g^3$ is equivalent to CG on the commonly-used embedded
geometry. We call two CG methods equivalent if they produce an identical
sequence of iterates $\{X_k\}$. In addition, we show that if the limit point of
the sequence $\{X_k\}$ generated by an algorithm has lower rank, that is
$X_k\in \mathbb C^{n\times n}, k = 1, 2, \ldots$ has rank $p$ and the limit
point $X_*$ has rank $r < p$, then the condition number of the Riemannian
Hessian with metric $g^1$ can be unbounded, but those of the other two metrics
stay bounded. Numerical experiments show that the Burer--Monteiro CG method has
slower local convergence rate if the limit point has a reduced rank, compared
to CG on the quotient geometry under the other two metrics. This slower
convergence rate can thus be attributed to the large condition number of the
Hessian near a minimizer.

task, which focuses on detecting the sentiment polarity towards the aspect in a
sentence. However, it is always sensitive to the multi-aspect challenge, where
features of multiple aspects in a sentence will affect each other. To mitigate
this issue, we design a novel training framework, called Contrastive
Cross-Channel Data Augmentation (C3 DA), which leverages an in-domain generator
to construct more multi-aspect samples and then boosts the robustness of ABSA
models via contrastive learning on these generated data. In practice, given a
generative pretrained language model and some limited ABSA labeled data, we
first employ some parameter-efficient approaches to perform the in-domain
fine-tuning. Then, the obtained in-domain generator is used to generate the
synthetic sentences from two channels, i.e., Aspect Augmentation Channel and
Polarity Augmentation Channel, which generate the sentence condition on a given
aspect and polarity respectively. Specifically, our C3 DA performs the sentence
generation in a cross-channel manner to obtain more sentences, and proposes an
Entropy-Minimization Filter to filter low-quality generated samples. Extensive
experiments show that our C3 DA can outperform those baselines without any
augmentations by about 1% on accuracy and Macro- F1. Code and data are released

design a system to achieve particular dynamics. Those problems often require
fitting differential equation models to target trajectories. Fitting such
models can be difficult because each evaluation of the fit must calculate the
distance between the model and target patterns at numerous points along a
trajectory. The gradient of the fit with respect to the model parameters can be
challenging. Recent technical advances in automatic differentiation through
numerical differential equation solvers potentially change the fitting process
into a relatively easy problem, opening up new possibilities to study dynamics.
However, application of the new tools to real data may fail to achieve a good
fit. This article illustrates how to overcome a variety of common challenges,
using the classic ecological data for oscillations in hare and lynx
populations. Models include simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which use artificial neural
networks to estimate the derivatives of differential equation systems.
Comparing the fits obtained with ODEs versus NODEs, representing small and
large parameter spaces, and changing the number of variable dimensions provide
insight into the geometry of the observed and model trajectories. To analyze
the quality of the models for predicting future observations, a
Bayesian-inspired preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (pSGLD)
calculation of the posterior distribution of predicted model trajectories
clarifies the tendency for various models to underfit or overfit the data.
Coupling fitted differential equation systems with pSGLD sampling provides a
powerful way to study the properties of optimization surfaces, raising an
analogy with mutation-selection dynamics on fitness landscapes.

state transitions during the process execution under different conditions. A
state transition is defined as the memory modification the program does to the

applications. Moreover, these methods usually require expertise like class
names to extract class semantic embedding, which are hard to get for rare
classes. Our approach is motivated by the high-level conceptual similarity of
(metric-based) meta-learning and prompt-based learning to learn generalizable
few-shot and zero-shot object detection models respectively without
fine-tuning. Specifically, we combine the few-shot visual classifier and text
classifier learned via meta-learning and prompt-based learning respectively to
build the multi-modal classifier and detection models. In addition, to fully
exploit the pre-trained language models, we propose meta-learning-based
cross-modal prompting to generate soft prompts for novel classes present in
few-shot visual examples, which are then used to learn the text classifier.
Knowledge distillation is introduced to learn the soft prompt generator without
using human prior knowledge of class names, which may not be available for rare
classes. Our insight is that the few-shot support images naturally include

predicting the class of the missing object from the bottom-up features, from
which a semantic object map is derived as the input of the top-down stream.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can generate realistic objects

introduces an adversarial performance validation network into a 2D-to-3D

contribute to accurate segmentation results via back-propagation. The proposed
network organically converts the 2D-coarse result to 3D high-quality
segmentation masks in a coarse-to-fine manner, allowing joint optimization to
improve segmentation accuracy. Besides, the structural information of one
specific organ is depicted by a statistics-meaningful prior bounding box, which
is transformed into a global feature leveraging the learning process in 3D fine

demonstrate the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on small

reported on multi-organ segmentation in a dataset collected by ourselves.

employing NB-IoT technology, inter-cell interference can be a problem, raising
serious concerns regarding the performance of NB-IoT, particularly in uplink
transmission. Thus, a power allocation method must be established to analyze
uplink performance, control and predict inter-cell interference, and avoid
excessive energy waste during transmission. Unfortunately, standard power
allocation techniques become inappropriate as their computational complexity
grows in an ultra-dense environment. Furthermore, the performance of NB-IoT is
strongly dependent on the traffic generated by IoT devices. In order to tackle

identifying individuals from a long distance by their walking patterns. In
recent years, most gait recognition methods used the person's silhouette to
extract the gait features. However, silhouette images can lose fine-grained
spatial information, suffer from (self) occlusion, and be challenging to obtain
in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, these silhouettes also contain other
visual clues that are not actual gait features and can be used for
identification, but also to fool the system. Model-based methods do not suffer
from these problems and are able to represent the temporal motion of body
joints, which are actual gait features. The advances in human pose estimation
started a new era for model-based gait recognition with skeleton-based gait
recognition. In this work, we propose an approach based on Graph Convolutional

efficient architecture for gait recognition. Extensive experiments on the two

  This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of RFDrone, a

wireless signals, which can naturally identify each individual nanodrone. To do
so, each light-weight nanodrone is attached with a RF sticker (i.e., called

channel estimation (CE) is becoming one of the main performance bottlenecks.
This is due to the large number users whose channels should be estimated, the
user mobility, and the rapid channel change caused by the usage of the
high-frequency spectrum (e.g. millimeter wave). In this work, we propose a new
hybrid channel estimation/prediction (CEP) scheme to reduce overhead in
time-division duplex (TDD) wireless cell-free massive
multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The scheme proposes sending a
pilot signal from each user only once in a given number (window) of coherence
intervals (CIs). Then minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation is used to
estimate the channel of this CI, while a deep neural network (DNN) is used to
predict the channels of the remaining CIs in the window. The DNN exploits the
temporal correlation between the consecutive CIs and the received pilot signals
to improve the channel prediction accuracy. By doing so, CE overhead is reduced
by at least 50 percent at the expense of negligible CE error for practical user
mobility settings. Consequently, the proposed CEP scheme improves the spectral
efficiency compared to the conventional MMSE CE approach, especially when the
number of users is large, which is demonstrated numerically.

in a classical phase space, we formulate a quantum kinetic treatment of this
problem, generalizing the classical kinetic approach [C. Gomes, Eur. Phys. J. C
80, 633 (2020)]. This allows us to study the interplay between non-minimal
matter-curvature coupling effects, quantum effects, and kinetic
(finite-temperature) effects, on the Jeans criterion. We study in detail
special cases of the model (general relativity, f(R) theories, pure non-minimal
coupling, etc.) and confront the model with the observed stability of Bok
globules.

  A Case Study of Washington DC",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bike-sharing is becoming increasingly popular as an urban traffic mode while
increasing the affordability, flexibility, and reliability of interconnected
public transportation systems (i.e., interconnected light rail, buses,
micro-mobility, and ride-sharing modes of transportation). From the consumers
perspective, 1) finding a bike station in convenient locations where demand
usually occurs and 2) the availability of bikes at rush hours with a lesser
probability of encountering empty docks (for fixed-station bike-share systems)
are two key concerns. Some stations are more likely to be empty or full,
reflecting an imbalance in bike supply and demand. Accordingly, it is essential
to understand a bike-share system's demand pattern to select the optimal
locations and reallocate bikes to the right stations to increase the
utilization rate and reduce the number of unserved customers (i.e., potential
demand). The Capital Bikeshare in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area is one of
the prominent bike-share systems in the USA - with more than 4,300 bikes
available at 654 stations across seven jurisdictions. This study provides a
systematic analysis of a bike-sharing system's Capital Bikeshare system usage
pattern. Our study intends to create an optimization strategy formulated as a
deterministic integer programming for reallocating bike stations daily and
rebalancing the bike supply system. From an operational perspective, such a
strategy will allow overnight preparations to answer the rush-hour morning
demand and during special events in Washington D.C.

also a type of quantum radar known as quantum two-mode squeezing radar. The

under different control policies like vaccinations, quarantines, lockdowns, use

represent real-life situations, they may become an important tool in the
decision-making process. Among these models, compartmental models are very
popular and assume individuals move along a series of compartments that
describe their current health status. Nevertheless, these models are mostly
Markovian, that is, the time in each compartment follows an exponential
distribution. In epidemic models, exponential sojourn times are most of the
times unrealistic, for instance, they imply that the probability that a patient
will recover from some disease in the next time unit is independent of the time
the patient has been sick. This is an important restriction that prevents these
models from being widely accepted and trusted by decision-makers. In spite of
the need to incorporate algorithms to tackle the problem, literature on the
topic is scarce. Here, we introduce a novel approach to simulate general
stochastic epidemic models that accepts any distribution for the sojourn times
that is efficient.

Using a panel dataset covering forty years, specifically 1946-1985, this study
investigates how weather conditions and social networks influenced the labor
supply of Sumo wrestlers. Major findings are; (1) inclemency of the weather in
local areas increased supply of Sumo wrestlers in the period 1946-1965, (2) the
effect of the bad weather conditions is greater in the locality where large
number of Sumo wrestlers were supplied in the pre-war period, (3) neither the
occurrence of bad weather conditions nor their interactions with sumo-wrestlers

imply that the negative shock of bad weather conditions on agriculture in the
rural areas incentivized young individuals to be apprenticed in Sumo stables in
Tokyo. Additionally, in such situations, the social networks within Sumo
wrestler communities from the same locality are important. However, once the
share of workers in agricultural sectors became very low, this mechanism did
not work.

assign a relevant action class. We first analyze the existing datasets on video
action detection and discuss their limitations. Next, we propose a new dataset,
Multi Actor Multi Action (MAMA) which overcomes these limitations and is more
suitable for real world applications. In addition, we perform a biasness study
which analyzes a key property differentiating videos from static images: the
temporal aspect. This reveals if the actions in these datasets really need the
motion information of an actor, or whether they predict the occurrence of an
action even by looking at a single frame. Finally, we investigate the widely
held assumptions on the importance of temporal ordering: is temporal ordering
important for detecting these actions? Such extreme experiments show existence
of biases which have managed to creep into existing methods inspite of careful
modeling.

for DL frameworks, aiming to improve our knowledge on this topic. Our study
covers 10 most popular open-sourced DL frameworks on GitHub (e.g., TensorFlow,

and accuracy bugs bug reports out of a total population of 22,522. Through
systematic analysis of these samples, our key findings are: (1) low speed is
the primary reason that a performance bug related report is submitted but we
see no consistent pattern for accuracy related ones; (2) most of the reports
are about issues encountered in the training stage; (3) only a small proportion
of the reports provide insufficient information to investigate; (4) the
majority of the performance and accuracy bugs bug reports (from 69% to 100%)
are not related to the actual bug or regarded as unclassified; (5) around 50%
of the performance and accuracy bug reports, which indeed reveal bugs, are not

in IRS-assisted systems; however, estimating the spatial CCM is challenging due
to the passive nature of reflecting elements and the large size of the CCM
resulting from massive reflecting elements of the IRS. In this paper, we
propose a CCM estimation method by exploiting the low-rankness as well as the
positive semi-definite (PSD) 3-level Toeplitz structure of the CCM. Estimation
of the CCM is formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem and an
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is developed. Our
analysis shows that the proposed method is theoretically guaranteed to attain a
reliable CCM estimate with a sample complexity much smaller than the dimension
of the CCM. Thus the proposed method can help achieve a significant training
overhead reduction. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method and the performance of two-timescale

decades. Recently, a dynamo mechanism operating in rapidly rotating and
crystallizing white dwarfs has been suggested to explain the occurrence rates
of strong magnetic fields in white dwarfs with close low-mass main sequence
star companions. Here we investigate whether the same mechanism may produce
strong magnetic fields in close double white dwarfs. The only known strongly
magnetic white dwarf that is part of a close double white dwarf system, the
magnetic component of NLTT 12758, is rapidly rotating and likely crystallizing
and therefore the proposed dynamo mechanism represents an excellent scenario
for the origin of its magnetic field. Presenting a revised formation scenario
for NLTT 12758, we find a natural explanation for the rapid rotation of the
magnetic component. We furthermore show that it is not surprising that strong
magnetic fields have not been detected in all other known double white dwarfs.
We therefore conclude that the incidence of magnetic fields in close double
white dwarfs supports the idea that a rotation and crystallization driven
dynamo plays a major role in the generation of strong magnetic fields in white
dwarfs.

software ones because they are persistent after fabrication. Thus, it is
crucial to assess the security and fix the vulnerabilities at earlier design
phases, such as Register Transfer Level (RTL) and gate level. The focus of the
existing security assessment techniques is mainly twofold. First, they check
the security of Intellectual Property (IP) blocks separately. Second, they aim
to assess the security against individual threats considering the threats are
orthogonal. We argue that IP-level security assessment is not sufficient.
Eventually, the IPs are placed in a platform, such as a system-on-chip (SoC),
where each IP is surrounded by other IPs connected through glue logic and
shared/private buses. Hence, we must develop a methodology to assess the
platform-level security by considering both the IP-level security and the
impact of the additional parameters introduced during platform integration.
Another important factor to consider is that the threats are not always
orthogonal. Improving security against one threat may affect the security
against other threats. Hence, to build a secure platform, we must first answer
the following questions: What additional parameters are introduced during the
platform integration? How do we define and characterize the impact of these
parameters on security? How do the mitigation techniques of one threat impact
others? This paper aims to answer these important questions and proposes
techniques for quantifiable assurance by quantitatively estimating and
measuring the security of a platform at the pre-silicon stages. We also touch

room-temperature ferromagnetism and semiconducting property were found in 2D
VSe$_2$ nanoflakes (mechanically exfoliated onto silicon substrates capped with
a oxide layer) and are attributed to the stable 2H-phase of VSe$_2$ in the 2D
limit. Here, our first-principles investigation show that a metastable
semiconducting H' phase can be formed from the H VSe2 monolayer and some other
similar when these 2D H-phase materials are under uniaxial stress or uniaxial
strain. For the uniaxial stress (uniaxial strain) scheme, the H' phase will
become lower in total energy than the H phase at the transition point. The
calculated phonon spectra indicate the dynamical stability of the H' structures
of VSe$_2$, VS$_2$, and CrS$_2$, and the path of phase switching between the H
and H' VSe$_2$ phases is calculated. For VSe$_2$, the H' phase has stronger
ferromagnetism and its Currier temperature can be substantially enhanced by
applying uniaxial stress or strain. Spin-resolved electronic structures, energy
band edges, and effective carrier masses for both of the H and H' phases can be
substantially changed by the applied uniaxial stress or strain, leading to huge
effective masses near the band edge of the strained H' phase. Analysis
indicated that the largest bond length difference between the H' and H phases
can reach -19\% for the Se3-Se3' bond, and there is noticeable covalence for
the Se3-Se3' bond, which switches the valence of the nearby V atoms, leading to
the enhanced ferromagnetism. Therefore, structural and bond reconstruction can
be realized by applying uniaxial stress in 2D ferromagnetic H VSe$_2$ and some
other similar. These can be useful to seeking more insights and phenomena in
such 2D materials for potential applications.

language (V&L) task, REC does is less impacted by language prior. In addition,
with a proper combination of these findings, we can improve the performance of

existing REC methods. But the most encouraging finding is that with much less
training overhead and parameters, SimREC can still achieve better performance
than a set of large-scale pre-trained models, e.g., UNITER and VILLA,
portraying the special role of REC in existing V&L research.

Unlike the traditional database queries which are mostly based on value
equality, similarity queries aim to find targets ""similar enough to"" the given
data objects, depending on some similarity metric, e.g., Euclidean distance,
cosine similarity and so on. To measure the similarity between data objects,
traditional methods normally work on low level or syntax features(e.g., basic
visual features on images or bag-of-word features of text), which makes them
weak to compute the semantic similarities between objects. So for measuring
data similarities semantically, neural embedding is applied. Embedding
techniques work by representing the raw data objects as vectors (so called
""embeddings"" or ""neural embeddings"" since they are mostly generated by neural
network models) that expose the hidden semantics of the raw data, based on
which embeddings do show outstanding effectiveness on capturing data
similarities, making it one of the most widely used and studied techniques in
the state-of-the-art similarity query processing research. But there are still
many open challenges on the efficiency of embedding based similarity query
processing, which are not so well-studied as the effectiveness. In this survey,
we first provide an overview of the ""similarity query"" and ""similarity query
processing"" problems. Then we talk about recent approaches on designing the
indexes and operators for highly efficient similarity query processing on top
of embeddings (or more generally, high dimensional data). Finally, we
investigate the specific solutions with and without using embeddings in
selected application domains of similarity queries, including entity resolution
and information retrieval. By comparing the solutions, we show how neural
embeddings benefit those applications.

different from the airfoils with which the model has been trained. Because a
computational fluid dynamic evaluation of the cruise condition is usually
necessary and affordable in industrial design, a novel deep learning framework
is proposed to utilize the cruise flowfield as a prior reference for the
off-design condition prediction. A prior variational autoencoder is developed
to extract features from the cruise flowfield and to generate new flowfields
under other free stream conditions. Physical-based loss functions based on
aerodynamic force and conservation of mass are derived to minimize the
prediction error of the flowfield reconstruction. The results demonstrate that
the proposed model can reduce the prediction error on test airfoils by 30%
compared to traditional models. The physical-based loss function can further
reduce the prediction error by 4%. The proposed model illustrates a better
balance of the time cost and the fidelity requirements of evaluation for cruise
and off-design conditions, which makes the model more feasible for industrial
applications.

additional attribute gives rise to a mixed phase, in contrast to the ordered

find the sudden appearance of clusters of nonaligners. Clusters of nonaligners
coexist with moving clusters of aligners with continual coalescence and
fragmentation. The behavior of the system with respect to the clustering of
nonaligners appears to be very different for values of low and high global
densities. In the low density regime, for an optimal value of the threshold,
the largest cluster of nonaligners grows in size up to a maximum that varies
logarithmically with the total number of particles. However, on further
increasing the threshold the size decreases. In contrast, for the high density
regime, an initial abrupt rise is followed by the appearance of a giant cluster
of nonaligners. The latter growth can be characterized as a continuous

their applications to the quantum technologies. An electron levitated in a
vacuum by a Paul trap is expected to be a good candidate, for its light mass
and hence the high secular frequency which allows for the faster gate
operations than those in trapped ions. Controlling the motional state of the
trapped electron is a crucial issue, for it mediates an interaction between
electron spins, intrinsic qubits embedded in electrons, and its decoherence
results in degraded fidelity of two-qubit gates. In addition, an efficient
readout of the motional state is important, regarding the possibility of
detecting spin state by using it. Despite of such an importance, how to achieve
the motional ground state and how to efficiently detect it are not reported so
far. Here we propose methods addressing these issues by utilizing hybrid
quantum systems involving electron-superconducting circuit and electron-ion
coupled systems and analyze the feasibility of our schemes. In both systems, we
show that the ground-state cooling and the single-phonon readout of the
motional state of the trapped electron are possible. Our work shed light on the
way to precisely control the motional states of the trapped electrons, that
provides an interesting playground for the development of quantum technologies.

acceleration of RL CMEs in SC 24 (--17.39 $\pm$ 43.51 m s$^{-2}$) is two times
lower than that of the RL CMEs in SC 23 (--8.29 $\pm$ 36.23 m s$^{-2}$), which
means that deceleration of RL CMEs in SC 24 is twice as fast as in SC 23. RL
CMEs of SC 23 (1443 $\pm$ 504 km s$^{-1}$; 13.82 $\pm$ 7.40

has a lower average CME nose height (3.85 \emph{R}$_{\circledcirc}$) at the
start time of DH type II bursts than that of SC 24 (3.46

associated with RL CMEs for SC 24 are significantly larger (formed at lower
heights) than that of SC 23. We found that there is a good correlation between
the drift rates and the mid-frequencies of DH type II radio bursts for both the
solar cycles (\emph{R} = 0.80, $\epsilon$ = 1.53). Most of the RL CMEs
kinematics and their associated solar flare properties are found similar for SC

different rotations of the sensor; (ii) there can be a strong imbalance in the
distribution of semantic classes because the relevant objects of the scene may
appear at extremely different scales (e.g., a field of crops and a small

use together a set of suitable augmentation and a consistency loss to guide the
model to learn semantic representations that are invariant to the photometric

superconducting phases and $T_\mathrm{c} = 0.26$ K. When $H\parallel c$, it
shows a field-induced transition at $\mu_0H^* = 4$ T from a low-field
superconducting state SC1 to a high-field state SC2 with a large critical field
of $\mu_0H_\mathrm{c2} = 14$ T. In contrast, for $H\perp c$, only the SC1 with
$\mu_0H_\mathrm{c2} = 2$ T is observed. A simple model based on the crystal
symmetry was able to reproduce the phase-diagrams and their anisotropy,
identifying SC1 and SC2 with even and odd parity superconducting states,
respectively. However, additional orders were observed in the normal state
which might have an influence on the change of the superconducting state at
$H^*$. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the angle dependence of the
upper critical fields using magnetic ac-susceptibility, specific heat and
torque on single crystals of CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The experiments show that the
state SC2 is strongly suppressed when rotating the magnetic field away from the
$c$ axis and it disappears for an angle of 35$^{\circ}$. This behavior agrees
perfectly with our extended model of a pseudospin triplet state with $\vec{d}$
vector in the plane and hence allows to nail down that SC2 is indeed the
suggested odd-parity state.

reduce the workload. Within this scheme, annotators are provided with candidate
relation instances from distant supervision, and they then manually supplement
and remove relational facts based on the recommendations. However, when
comparing DocRED with a subset relabeled from scratch, we find that this scheme
results in a considerable amount of false negative samples and an obvious bias
towards popular entities and relations. Furthermore, we observe that the models
trained on DocRED have low recall on our relabeled dataset and inherit the same
bias in the training data. Through the analysis of annotators' behaviors, we
figure out the underlying reason for the problems above: the scheme actually
discourages annotators from supplementing adequate instances in the revision
phase. We appeal to future research to take into consideration the issues with
the recommend-revise scheme when designing new models and annotation schemes.

We observe that the structure functions for inclusive charm and bottom

that the heavy quark structure function is a function of only one dimensionless
variable $\tau{\equiv}Q^{2}/Q^{2}_{sat}(x)$ including quark mass. These results
are valid for any value of $\delta$, being $x^{-\delta}$ the behavior of the
parton densities at low $x$. The determination of the heavy quark structure

$F_{2}(x,Q^{2})$ and its derivative. Analytical expressions for
$F_{2,L}^{\mathcal{Q}\bar{\mathcal{Q}}}$ in terms of the effective parameters
of the parameterization of $F_{2}(x,Q^{2})$ ,with respect to the BDH and ASW
models, are presented. To study the heavy quark production processes, we use
the collinear results in DAS approach. Numerical calculations and comparison
with HERA data demonstrate that the suggested method provides reliable

$\sigma^{\mathcal{Q}\bar{\mathcal{Q}}}$ at low $x$ in a wide range of the low

extraction techniques, named entity recognition (NER) is widely used to extract
information from texts for downstream tasks. Nested NER is a branch of NER in
which the named entities (NEs) are nested with each other. However, most of the
previous studies on nested NER usually apply linear structure to model the
nested NEs which are actually accommodated in a hierarchical structure. Thus in
order to address this mismatch, this work models the full nested NEs in a
sentence as a holistic structure, then we propose a holistic structure parsing
algorithm to disclose the entire NEs once for all. Besides, there is no
research on applying corpus-level information to NER currently. To make up for
the loss of this information, we introduce Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI)
and other frequency features from corpus-aware statistics for even better
performance by holistic modeling from sentence-level to corpus-level.
Experiments show that our model yields promising results on widely-used
benchmarks which approach or even achieve state-of-the-art. Further empirical
studies show that our proposed corpus-aware features can substantially improve
NER domain adaptation, which demonstrates the surprising advantage of our
proposed corpus-level holistic structure modeling.

on a priori information specifically for the single-scanning data. Method: An
iterative method that directly reconstructs the refractive index decrement
delta and imaginary beta of the object from observed data (""one-step"") within
single object-to-detector distance (ODD) scanning. Simultaneously, high-quality
quantitative reconstruction results are obtained by using a linear
approximation that achieves material decomposition in the iterative process.
Results: By comparing the equivalent atomic number of the material
decomposition results in experiments, the accuracy of the proposed method is
greater than 97.2%. Conclusion: The quantitative reconstruction and
decomposition results are effectively improved, and there are feedback and
corrections during the iteration, which effectively reduce the impact of noise
and errors. Significance: This algorithm has the potential for quantitative
imaging research, especially for imaging live samples and human breast

includes, in addition to the canonical term, a term proportional to the trace
of the energy-momentum tensor, $T=\rho-3p$, and constrain these models using
low redshift background cosmology data. One may think of these models as
extensions of general relativity with a nonlinear matter Lagrangian, and they
can be studied either as phenomenological extensions of the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, containing both matter and a cosmological constant, or as
direct alternatives to it, where there is no cosmological constant but the
additional terms would have to be responsible for accelerating the universe.
Overall, our main finding is that parametric extensions of $\Lambda$CDM are
tightly constrained, with additional model parameters being constrained to
their canonical behaviours to within one standard deviation, while alternative
models in this class (which do not have a $\Lambda$CDM limit) are ruled out.
This provides some insight on the level of robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model

Schnorr's constant can be used to characterize the output quality of his block
$2k$-reduction and is used to define his semi block $2k$-reduction, which was
also developed in 1987. Hermite's constant, which is a fundamental constant
lattices, has many applications, such as bounding the length of the shortest

constant was introduced by Rankin in 1953 as a generalization of Hermite's
constant. It plays an important role in characterizing the output quality of
block-Rankin reduction, proposed by Gama et al. in 2006. In this paper, we
first develop a linear upper bound on Hermite's constant and then use it to
develop an upper bound on the KZ constant. These upper bounds are sharper than
those obtained recently by the authors, and the ratio of the new linear upper
bound to the nonlinear upper bound, developed by Blichfeldt in 1929, on

sharpest existing one developed by Gama et al. is around 1.7 times

capabilities of Transformer for both spatial and temporal modeling. However, it
is challenging to design an appropriate Transformer-based model for video
deblurring due to the complicated non-uniform blurs, misalignment across
multiple frames and the high computational costs for high-resolution spatial

long-range dependencies modeling. For frame-level spatial modeling, we propose
an encoder-decoder Transformer that utilizes multi-scale features for
deblurring. For multi-frame temporal modeling, we adapt Transformer to fuse
multiple spatial features efficiently. Compared with CNN-based methods, the
proposed method achieves highly competitive results on both synthetic and

signal-based design elements intended to simulate environmental occurrences. In
a listening test conducted with over 50 participants, this new implementation
was perceived as the most realistic synthesised sound, though still
distinguishable from a real recording. Further improvements to the model, based
on insights from the listening test, were also implemented and described
herein.

wide range of applications, including visual question answering, automated

the VCR task generally rely on pre-training or exploiting memory with long

lack of generalizability and losing information in long sequences. In this
paper, we propose a parallel attention-based cognitive VCR network PAVCR, which
fuses visual-textual information efficiently and encodes semantic information
in parallel to enable the model to capture rich information for cognition-level

significant improvements over existing methods on the benchmark VCR dataset.

differentiates between an analysable chromosome and a non-analysable one.
Images are extracted from YOLOv4 based on the protocols described by

and blockchain solutions in the last decade. Nonetheless, Blockchain-based
systems still suffer from low transaction rates and high transaction processing
latencies, which hinder blockchains' scalability. An entire class of solutions,
called Layer-1 scalability solutions, have attempted to incrementally improve
such limitations by adding/modifying fundamental blockchain attributes.
Recently, a completely different class of works, called Layer-2 protocols, have
emerged to tackle the blockchain scalability issues using unconventional
approaches. Layer-2 protocols improve transaction processing rates, periods,
and fees by minimizing the use of underlying slow and costly blockchains. In
fact, the main chain acts just as an instrument for trust establishment and
dispute resolution among Layer-2 participants, where only a few transactions
are dispatched to the main chain. Thus, Layer-2 blockchain protocols have the
potential to transform the domain. However, rapid and discrete developments
have resulted in diverse branches of Layer-2 protocols. In this work, we
systematically create a broad taxonomy of such protocols and implementations.
We discuss each Layer-2 protocol class in detail and also elucidate their
respective approaches, salient features, requirements, etc. Moreover, we
outline the issues related to these protocols along with a comparative
discussion. Our thorough study will help further systematize the knowledge

investigation specifically when compared to the critical behavior near the
standard absorbing state phase transition. Since the phenomena of learning and
self-organized criticality (SOC) at the edge of synchronization transition can
emerge jointly in spiking neural networks due to the presence of spike-timing
dependent plasticity (STDP), it is tempting to ask: What is the relationship
between synchronization and learning in neural networks? Further, does learning
benefit from SOC at the edge of synchronization transition? In this paper, we
intend to address these important issues. Accordingly, we construct a
biologically inspired model of an autonomous cognitive system which learns to
perform stimulus-response tasks. We train this system using a reinforcement
learning rule implemented through dopamine-modulated STDP. We find that the
system exhibits a continuous transition from synchronous to asynchronous neural
oscillations upon increasing the average axonal time delay. We characterize the
learning performance of the system and observe that it is optimized near the
synchronization transition. We also study neuronal avalanches in the system and
provide evidence that optimized learning is achieved in a slightly

things (IoT) devices by evading data collection cost in terms of energy, time,
and privacy. We model the learning gain achieved by an IoT device against its
participation cost as its utility. Due to the device-heterogeneity, the local
model learning cost and its quality, which can be time-varying, differs from
device to device. We show that this variation results in utility unfairness
because the same global model is shared among the devices. By default, the
master is unaware of the local model computation and transmission costs of the
devices, thus it is unable to address the utility unfairness problem. Also, a
device may exploit this lack of knowledge at the master to intentionally reduce
its expenditure and thereby enhance its utility. We propose to control the
quality of the global model shared with the devices, in each round, based on
their contribution and expenditure. This is achieved by employing differential
privacy to curtail global model divulgence based on the learning contribution.
In addition, we devise adaptive computation and transmission policies for each
device to control its expenditure in order to mitigate utility unfairness. Our
results show that the proposed scheme reduces the standard deviation of the
energy cost of devices by 99% in comparison to the benchmark scheme, while the
standard deviation of the training loss of devices varies around 0.103.

modulates the prediction mechanism via a `fast weights' scheme in the

  Transition","11 pages, 3 figures, and appendix 8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.quant-gas","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) occurs when the system is
evolving under unitary evolution together with local measurements followed by
post-selection. We propose a generalized version of the Lindblad master
equation as a continuous equation, to describe the dynamics of second R\'enyi
entropy in the MIPT. This generalized Lindblad equation explicitly takes into
account the post-selection in the MIPT, which is realized as the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state projection in the equation. Also, this
generalized Lindblad equation preserves the Hermitian, unit trace, and positive
definiteness of the density matrix. We further use the hard-core Bose-Hubbard
model as a concrete example to numerically confirm that our generalized
Lindblad equation is applicable to describing the MIPT.

  profile by convex focusing plasma mirror",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A relatively efficient scheme to generate energetic $\gamma$-ray is
all-optical Compton scattering based on wakefield acceleration and plasma
mirror where planar or concave solid target is usually employed to reflect
driving pulse. For flat plasma mirror case, the colliding pulse radius is far
larger than the radius of accelerated electron beam, which leads to smaller
laser utilization efficiency. The concave plasma mirror can efficiently focus
reflected laser to match electron beam radius. But the produced photon beam
collimation is worse due to intensive transverse field and larger transverse
wave vector of colliding laser. Here, we propose a new mechanism to achieve
Compton scattering via employing convex plasma mirror. The convex plasma mirror
improves reflected laser longitudinal length in addition to focusing effect,
which ensures longer colliding time and larger laser utilization efficiency.
Importantly, it leads transverse wave vector of colliding laser to be smaller,
which guarantees better photon bunch collimation.

trajectory sequences. Our methods outperform existing models in accuracy, while
allowing an arbitrary number of modes, encoding complex multi-agent scenarios,
and adapting to different parking maps. To train and evaluate our method, we
present the first public 4K video dataset of human driving in parking lots with
accurate annotation, high frame rate, and rich traffic scenarios.

for mathematics than classical logic. It is a system proposed by Richard Diaz
in 1981. In a certain sense t-relevant logic is based on Kleene strong tables.
These define a system with three values: true, false, unknown. It turns out
that there exist tautologies with the following property: there exists a proper
subset of propositional variables (t-relevant variables) such that for all
combinations true/false the tautology will be true, that is, the rest of the
variables (redundant variables) occurring in the tautology can be unknown. We
consider such compound sentences as neither true nor false. Philosophical
justification is provided. Proof system based on tableaux is proposed. The
following theorem is proved: tautology L = (R1 v ~R1) & (R2 v ~R2) & ... & (Rm
v ~Rm), where {R1, R2, ... Rm} is a subset of t-relevant propositional
variables, and = is equivalence according to Kleene strong tables.

helpful to fill gaps in a partial input program. Our approach facilitates a
large-scale self-supervised contrastive training by splitting source code
randomly into contexts and targets. To combat leakage between the two, we
suggest a novel approach based on mutual identifier masking, dedentation, and
the selection of syntax-aligned targets. Our second contribution is a new
dataset for direct evaluation of contextualized code retrieval, based on a
dataset of manually aligned subpassages of code clones. Our experiments
demonstrate that our approach improves retrieval substantially, and yields new

that demand the coordination of learning agents. However, strong coordination
often leads to expensive exploration over the exponentially large state-action
space. A powerful approach is to decompose team works into roles, which are
ideally assigned to agents with the relevant skills. Training agents to
adaptively choose and play emerging roles in a team thus allows the team to
scale to complex tasks and quickly adapt to changing environments. These
promises, however, have not been fully realised by current role-based
multi-agent reinforcement learning methods as they assume either a pre-defined
role structure or a fixed team size. We propose a framework to learn role
assignment and transfer across team sizes. In particular, we train a role
assignment network for small teams by demonstration and transfer the network to
larger teams, which continue to learn through interaction with the environment.
We demonstrate that re-using the role-based credit assignment structure can
foster the learning process of larger reinforcement learning teams to achieve
tasks requiring different roles. Our proposal outperforms competing techniques
in enriched role-enforcing Prey-Predator games and in new scenarios in the
StarCraft II Micro-Management benchmark.
