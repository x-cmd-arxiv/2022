generates a system of satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) constraints-which
encode a network's configurations, control logic, and forwarding

configuration of the supersonic and subsonic regimes with the acoustic horizon
between them in the elongated two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, trying
to mimic Hawking radiations, in particular due to the gapped excitations. The
simplified step-like sound speed change is adopted for the subsonic-supersonic

energy gap term in the dispersion relation of the gapped excitations introduces
the threshold frequency $\omega_\text{min}$ in the subsonic regime, below which
the propagating modes do not exist. Thus, the particle spectrum of the Hawking
modes significantly deviates from that of the gapless cases near the threshold
frequency due to the modified grey-body factor, which vanishes as the mode
frequency is below $\omega_\text{min}$. The influence from the gapped
excitations to the quantum entanglement of the Hawking mode and its partner of
the gapless excitations is also studied according to the Peres-Horodecki-Simon
(PHS) criterion. It is found that the presence of the gapped excitations will
deteriorate the quantumness of the pair modes of the gapless excitations when
the frequency of the pair modes in particular is around $\omega \sim
\omega_\text{min}$. On top of that, when the coupling constant between the
gapless and gapped excitations becomes large enough, the huge particle density

effects such as unfair and overspecialized recommendation results. In this

which is connected to both fairness and diversity. On the one hand, it aims to
provide fairer recommendations whose preference distributions are consistent
with users' historical behaviors. On the other hand, it can improve the
diversity of recommendations to a certain degree. But existing methods for
calibration have mainly relied on the post-processing on the candidate lists,

two objectives to two individual sequence encoders, and aggregates the outputs
by extracting useful information. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate
the effectiveness of our proposed model.

spatial correlations by randomizing the location of the probes, as long as

result, superclassical precision scaling is asymptotically restored for initial

adverse weather remains challenging due to the poor perception of some sensors
in adverse weather. Instead of relying on one single sensor, multimodal fusion
has been one promising approach to provide redundant detection information
based on multiple sensors. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches
are ineffective in adjusting the focus of different sensors under varying
detection environments in dynamic adverse weather conditions. Moreover, it is
critical to simultaneously observe local and global information under complex
weather conditions, which has been neglected in most early or late-stage
multimodal fusion works. In view of these, this paper proposes a Global-Local
Attention (GLA) framework to adaptively fuse the multi-modality sensing
streams, i.e., camera, gated camera, and lidar data, at two fusion stages.
Specifically, GLA integrates an early-stage fusion via a local attention
network and a late-stage fusion via a global attention network to deal with
both local and global information, which automatically allocates higher weights
to the modality with better detection features at the late-stage fusion to cope
with the specific weather condition adaptively. Experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GLA compared with
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various adverse weather conditions,
such as light fog, dense fog, and snow.

sources of variation in their judgments. Within this scope, we present two

characterizing a wide range of criteria across which human and machine
decision-making differ. Second, formalizing our taxonomy allows us to study how

our proposed framework encompasses several existing models of human-ML
complementarity as special cases. Last but not least, an initial exploratory
analysis of our framework presents a critical insight for future work in
human-ML complementarity: the mechanism by which we combine human and ML
judgments should be informed by the underlying causes of divergence in their

norm for assessing reputations, and so norms compete as individuals choose to
move from one group to another. We show that a group initially comprising a

substantially reduce the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation depends
on constructing efficient, fault-tolerant implementations of logical gates on

the potential of transversal gates on LDPC codes has hitherto been largely
neglected. We investigate the transversal gates that can be implemented in
hypergraph product codes, a class of LDPC codes. Our analysis is aided by the
construction of a symplectic canonical basis for the logical operators of
hypergraph product codes, a result that may be of independent interest. We show
that in these codes transversal gates can implement Hadamard (up to logical
SWAP gates) and control-Z on all logical qubits. Moreover, we show that
sequences of transversal operations, interleaved with error correction, allow
implementation of entangling gates between arbitrary pairs of logical qubits in
the same code block. We thereby demonstrate that transversal gates can be used
as the basis for universal quantum computing on LDPC codes, when supplemented
with state injection.

proposes a new flow to increase the complexity of velocity models recovered

methods, instead of predicting the entire model in one step, we predict the
velocity model iteratively. We implement the iterative nature of the process
when, for each iteration, we train the DL algorithm to determine the velocity
model with a certain level of precision/resolution for the next iteration; we
name this process as Deep-Tomography. Starting from an initial model that
roughly approaches the true model, the Deep-Tomography is able to predict an
appropriate final model, even in complete unseen data, like the Marmousi model.

tokenization in low-resource languages, leading models to produce suboptimal
representations. Additionally, the dependency on a fixed vocabulary limits the
subword models' adaptability across languages and domains. In this work, we
propose a vocabulary-free neural tokenizer by distilling segmentation
information from heuristic-based subword tokenization. We pre-train our
character-based tokenizer by processing unique words from multilingual corpus,
thereby extensively increasing word diversity across languages. Unlike the
predefined and fixed vocabularies in subword methods, our tokenizer allows
end-to-end task learning, resulting in optimal task-specific tokenization. The
experimental results show that replacing the subword tokenizer with our neural
tokenizer consistently improves performance on multilingual (NLI) and
code-switching (sentiment analysis) tasks, with larger gains in low-resource
languages. Additionally, our neural tokenizer exhibits a robust performance on
downstream tasks when adversarial noise is present (typos and misspelling),
further increasing the initial improvements over statistical subword

the `extensor coding' method of Brand, Dell and Husfeldt [STOC'18], employing
properties of the exterior algebra over different fields.
  For the $k$-Path detection problem for directed graphs, it is known that no
efficient dynamic algorithm exists (under popular assumptions from fine-grained
complexity). We circumvent this by designing an efficient sensitivity oracle,
which preprocesses a directed graph on $n$ vertices in $2^k poly(k)
n^{\omega+o(1)}$ time, such that, given $\ell$ updates (mixing edge insertions
and deletions, and vertex deletions) to that input graph, it can decide in time
$\ell^2 2^kpoly(k)$ and with high probability, whether the updated graph
contains a path of length $k$. We also give a deterministic sensitivity oracle
requiring $4^k poly(k) n^{\omega+o(1)}$ preprocessing time and $\ell^2
2^{\omega k + o(k)}$ query time, and obtain a randomized sensitivity oracle for
the task of approximately counting the number of $k$-paths. For $k$-Path
detection in undirected graphs, we obtain a randomized sensitivity oracle with
$O(1.66^k n^3)$ preprocessing time and $O(\ell^3 1.66^k)$ query time, and a
better bound for undirected bipartite graphs.

Finally, we use optimal policy learning to determine (in a data-driven way)

that only two out of the five coupon categories examined, namely coupons

a star-shaped polygon. It is based on minimizing discrete Dirichlet energies,
following the idea of Tutte's embedding theorem. We will call it a geodesic
triangulation of the star-shaped polygon. Moreover, we study the homotopy
property of spaces of all straight-line embeddings. We give a simple argument
to show that this space is contractible if the boundary is a non-convex
quadrilateral. We conjecture that the same statement holds for general
star-shaped polygons.

leading/trailing hemispherical asymmetries in the strength of near-infrared
(NIR) H$_2$O ice absorption bands, in which the absorption bands are stronger
on the leading hemisphere. This is often attributed to a combination of
magnetospheric irradiation effects and impact gardening, which can modify grain
size, expose fresh ice, and produce dark contaminating compounds that reduce
the strength of absorption features. Previous research identified this
leading/trailing asymmetry on the four largest classical Uranian satellites but
did not find a clear leading/trailing asymmetry on Miranda, the smallest and
innermost classical moon. We undertook an extensive observational campaign to
investigate variations of the NIR spectral signature of H$_2$O ice with
longitude on Miranda's northern hemisphere. We acquired 22 new spectra with the
TripleSpec spectrograph on the ARC 3.5m telescope and 4 new spectra with GNIRS
on Gemini North. Our analysis also includes 3 unpublished and 7 previously
published spectra taken with SpeX on the 3m IRTF. We confirm that Miranda has
no substantial leading/trailing hemispherical asymmetry in the strength of its
H$_2$O ice absorption features. We additionally find evidence for an
anti-Uranus/sub-Uranus asymmetry in the strength of the 1.5-$\mu$m H$_2$O ice
band that is not seen on the other Uranian satellites, suggesting that
additional endogenic or exogenic processes influence the longitudinal
distribution of H$_2$O ice band strengths on Miranda.

Stellar
events are very common on such stars. These events might cause the atmospheres
of exoplanets to change significantly over time. It is not only the major
stellar flare events that contribute to this disequilibrium, but the smaller
flares might also affect the atmospheres in an accumulating manner. In this
study, we aim to investigate the effects of time-dependent stellar activity on
the atmospheres of known exoplanets. We simulate the chemistry of GJ876c,
GJ581c, and GJ832c that go from H$_2$-dominated to N$_2$-dominated atmospheres
using observed stellar spectra from the MUSCLES-collaboration. We make use of
the chemical kinetics code VULCAN and implement a flaring routine that
stochastically generates synthetic flares based on observed flare statistics.
Using the radiative transfer code petitRADTrans we also simulate the evolution
of emission and transmission spectra. We investigate the effect of recurring
flares for a total of 11 days covering 515 flares. Results show a significant
change in abundance for some relevant species such as H, OH, and CH$_4$, with
factors going up to 3 orders of magnitude difference with respect to the
preflare abundances. We find a maximum change of $\sim$12 ppm for CH$_4$ in
transmission spectra on GJ876c. These changes in the spectra remain too small
to observe. We also find that the change in abundance and spectra of the
planets accumulate throughout time, causing permanent changes in the chemistry.
We conclude this small but gradual change in chemistry arises due to the
recurring flares.

gained by averaging over multiple realizations. Consequently, a gradient-based

classification on another set. In this paper, we derive a sufficient condition
for such a stochastic prediction to be robust against a given sample-based
attack. This allows us to identify the factors that lead to an increased
robustness of SNNs and gives theoretical explanations for: (i) the well known
observation, that increasing the amount of samples drawn for the estimation of
adversarial examples increases the attack's strength, (ii) why increasing the
number of samples during an attack can not fully reduce the effect of
stochasticity, (iii) why the sample size during inference does not influence
the robustness, and (iv) why a higher gradient variance and a shorter expected
value of the gradient relates to a higher robustness. Our theoretical findings
give a unified view on the mechanisms underlying previously proposed approaches
for increasing attack strengths or model robustness and are verified by an
extensive empirical analysis.

that strives to achieve better object-background discriminability for accurate
object segmentation. Distinct from previous self-supervised VOS methods, our
approach is based on a discriminative learning loss formulation that takes into
account both object and background information to ensure object-background
discriminability, rather than using only object appearance. The discriminative
learning loss comprises cutout-based reconstruction (cutout region represents
part of a frame, whose pixels are replaced with some constant values) and tag
prediction loss terms. The cutout-based reconstruction term utilizes a simple
cutout scheme to learn the pixel-wise correspondence between the current and
previous frames in order to reconstruct the original current frame with added
cutout region in it. The introduced cutout patch guides the model to focus as
much on the significant features of the object of interest as the less
significant ones, thereby implicitly equipping the model to address
occlusion-based scenarios. Next, the tag prediction term encourages
object-background separability by grouping tags of all pixels in the cutout
region that are similar, while separating them from the tags of the rest of the
reconstructed frame pixels. Additionally, we introduce a zoom-in scheme that
addresses the problem of small object segmentation by capturing fine structural
information at multiple scales. Our proposed approach, termed CT-VOS, achieves
state-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks: DAVIS-2017 and
Youtube-VOS. A detailed ablation showcases the importance of the proposed loss
formulation to effectively capture object-background discriminability and the
impact of our zoom-in scheme to accurately segment small-sized objects.

glial cells, not only serve metabolic and structural support for neurons and
synapses but also play critical roles in regulation of proper functioning of
the nervous system. In this work, we investigate the effect of astrocyte on the
spontaneous firing activity of a neuron through a combined model which includes
a neuron-astrocyte pair. First, we show that an astrocyte may provide a kind of
multistability in neuron dynamics by inducing different firing modes such as
random and bursty spiking. Then, we identify the underlying mechanism of this
behavior and search for the astrocytic factors that may have regulatory roles
in different firing regimes. More specifically, we explore how an astrocyte can
participate in occurrence and control of spontaneous irregular spiking activity
of a neuron in random spiking mode. Additionally, we systematically investigate
the bursty firing regime dynamics of the neuron under the variation of
biophysical facts related to the intracellular environment of the astrocyte. It

optimization (MMMOO) landscapes brought a new perspective to their search
dynamics. Locally efficient (LE) sets, often considered as traps for local
search, are rarely isolated in the decision space. Rather, intersections by
superposing attraction basins lead to further solution sets that at least
partially contain better solutions. The Multi-Objective Gradient Sliding
Algorithm (MOGSA) is an algorithmic concept developed to exploit these
superpositions. While it has promising performance on many MMMOO problems with
linear LE sets, closer analysis of MOGSA revealed that it does not sufficiently
generalize to a wider set of test problems. Based on a detailed analysis of
shortcomings of MOGSA, we propose a new algorithm, the Multi-Objective
Landscape Explorer (MOLE). It is able to efficiently model and exploit LE sets
in MMMOO problems. An implementation of MOLE is presented for the bi-objective

experiment on the Bi-Objective BBOB testbed.

manipulation while enabling high-quality novel view synthesis. While NeRF-based
approaches are effective for novel view synthesis, such models memorize the
radiance for every point in a scene within a neural network. Since these models
are scene-specific and lack a 3D scene representation, classical editing such
as shape manipulation, or combining scenes is not possible. Hence, editing and
combining NeRF-based scenes has not been demonstrated. With the aim of
obtaining interpretable and controllable scene representations, our model
couples learnt scene-specific feature volumes with a scene agnostic neural
rendering network. With this hybrid representation, we decouple neural
rendering from scene-specific geometry and appearance. We can generalize to
novel scenes by optimizing only the scene-specific 3D feature representation,
while keeping the parameters of the rendering network fixed. The rendering
function learnt during the initial training stage can thus be easily applied to
new scenes, making our approach more flexible. More importantly, since the
feature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and
combine scenes by editing their corresponding feature volumes. The edited
volume can then be plugged into the rendering model to synthesize high-quality
novel views. We demonstrate various scene manipulations, including mixing
scenes, deforming objects and inserting objects into scenes, while still
producing photo-realistic results.

including identifying infectious disease outbreaks, assessing land use
patterns, pinpointing crime hotspots, and identifying clusters of neurons in
brain imaging applications. While performing spatial clustering analysis on
point process data is common, applications to areal data are frequently of
interest. For example, researchers might wish to know if census tracts with a
case of a rare medical condition or an outbreak of an infectious disease tend
to cluster together spatially. Since few spatial clustering methods are
designed for areal data, researchers often reduce the areal data to point
process data (e.g., using the centroid of each areal unit) and apply methods
designed for point process data, such as Ripley's K function or the average
nearest neighbor method. However, since these methods were not designed for
areal data, a number of issues can arise. For example, we show that they can
result in loss of power and/or a significantly inflated type I error rate. To
address these issues, we propose a generalization of Ripley's K function
designed specifically to detect spatial clustering in areal data. We compare
its performance to that of the traditional Ripley's K function, the average
nearest neighbor method, and the spatial scan statistic with an extensive
simulation study. We then evaluate the real world performance of the method by
using it to detect spatial clustering in land parcels containing conservation
easements and US counties with high pediatric overweight/obesity rates.

poles that are seen as bright regions along the edges of granules. The time
variation in the number of PFe has been shown to correlate with the strength of
the polar magnetic field and to be a predictor of the subsequent solar cycle.
Due to the small size and transient nature of these features, combined with
different techniques and observational factors, previous counts of PFe differ
in magnitude. Further, there were no scalable techniques to measure the
statistical properties of faculae. Using data from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present
two new methods for tracking faculae and measuring their properties. In the
first, we calculate the standard deviation of the HMI images over one day,
visualizing the faculae as streaks. The facular lifetime is found by dividing
the angular streak length by the latitude-dependent rotation rate. We apply
this method to 134 days of data over 11 years. The distribution of facular
lifetimes has a mean of 6.0 hours, a FWHM of 5.4 hours, and a skew towards
longer lifetimes, with some lasting up to 1 day. In the second method, we
overlay images of the progressive standard deviation with the HMI magnetogram
to show the close relationship between facular candidates and the magnetic
field. The results allow us to distinguish between motion due to the Sun's
rotation and ""proper motion"" due to faculae moving across the Sun's surface,
confirming that PFe participate in convective motions at the poles. Counts of
PFe using both methods agree with previous counts in their variation with the
solar cycle and the polar magnetic field. These methods can be extended to
automate the identification and measurement of other properties of of PFe,
which would allow for daily measurements of all faculae since SDO began
operation in 2010.

211211A's gamma-ray light curve is reminiscent of previous extended emission
short GRBs (EE-SGRBs), its prompt, bright spikes last $\gtrsim 12$ s,
separating it from past EE-SGRBs. GRB 211211A's kilonova has a similar
luminosity, duration and color to AT2017gfo, the kilonova found in association
with the gravitational wave (GW)-detected binary neutron star (BNS) merger
GW170817. We find that the merger ejected $\approx 0.04 M_{\odot}$ of
r-process-rich material, and is consistent with the merger of two neutron stars
(NSs) with masses close to the canonical $1.4 M_{\odot}$. This discovery
implies that GRBs with long, complex light curves can be spawned from compact
object merger events and that a population of kilonovae following GRBs with
durations $\gg 2$ s should be accounted for in calculations of the NS merger
r-process contribution and rate. At 350 Mpc, the current network of GW
interferometers at design sensitivity would have detected the merger
precipitating GRB 211211A, had it been operating at the time of the event.

35 extragalactic Cepheid hosts measured by the SH0ES team, using their
distances and redshifts at cz < 3300 km /s , instead of any, more distant Type

accuracy on downstream tasks (e.g., recognition). Our framework does not
require fine-tuning of the downstream task, which allows us to drop-in any
off-the-shelf downstream task model without retraining. We choose faces as an
application domain due to the ready availability of datasets and off-the-shelf

compression ratio is achieved as the model learns to retain the domain-specific

Furthermore, images reconstructed by our proposed compression model are robust
to changes in downstream model architectures. We show at-par recognition
performance on the LFW dataset with an unseen recognition model while retaining

corrections to all orders. Secondly, for the quantum spin-boson model we prove,
by carefully taking a large spin limit, that Bohr's quantum-classical
correspondence persists at all coupling strengths. This correspondence gives
insight into the conditions for a coupled quantum spin to be well-approximated
by a coupled classical spin-vector. Thirdly, we demonstrate that previously
identified environment-induced 'coherences' in the equilibrium state of weakly
coupled quantum spins, do not disappear in the classical case. Finally, we
provide the first classification of the coupling parameter regimes for the
spin-boson model, from weak to ultrastrong, both for the quantum case and the

to shear Alfv\'en waves, exists for any nonzero magnetic field strength as long

epidemiology, ecology, biology, physics, and sociology. In these fields, areal
data is often of interest; such data may result from spatial aggregation (e.g.
the number disease cases in a county) or may be inherent attributes of the
areal unit as a whole (e.g. the habitat suitability of conserved land parcel).
This study aims to assess the performance of two spatial clustering detection
methods on areal data: the average nearest neighbor (ANN) ratio and Ripley's K
function. These methods are designed for point process data, but their ease of
implementation in GIS software (e.g., in ESRI ArcGIS) and the lack of analogous
methods for areal data have contributed to their use for areal data. Despite
the popularity of applying these methods to areal data, little research has
explored their properties in the areal data context. In this paper we conduct a
simulation study to evaluate the performance of each method for areal data
under various areal structures and types of spatial dependence. These studies
find that traditional approach to hypothesis testing using the ANN ratio or
Ripley's K function results in inflated empirical type I rates when applied to
areal data. We demonstrate that this issue can be remedied for both approaches
by using Monte Carlo methods which acknowledge the areal nature of the data to
estimate the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.
While such an approach is not currently implemented in ArcGIS, it can be easily
done in R using code provided by the authors.

Dislocation-based damage in structures/components is the source of the failure;
thus, beta has been studied as a metric for non-destructive evaluation. This
work consists of two parts: the development of an in situ experimental setup
for nonlinear Rayleigh wave measurements, and characterization of the
dependence of beta on applied stress at different levels of initial plastic
strain. First, we introduce an experimental setup and methods for repeatable in
situ nonlinear ultrasonic measurements. Details on design considerations and
measurement schemes are provided. In the second part, beta was measured in situ
during an incremental monotonic tensile test. The measured \beta monotonically
decreases with plastic strain, but it is relatively insensitive to the applied
stress during elastic deformation. This result highlights three aspects of the
evolution of beta, which have not been sufficiently emphasized in prior work:
the apparent insensitivity of beta to the applied stress during elastic
deformation, decreasing beta with plastic deformation, and the saturation of
beta. We attribute the trend of decreasing beta to a scaling of beta with
monopole loop length during plastic deformation, which depends on initial
microstructure. The saturation of beta at 1.8% coincides with a planar-to-wavy
transition of dislocation structures. The in situ nonlinear ultrasonic
experimental method presented in this work is significant as the in situ
results can provide broader insights on beta and dislocation-based damage
evolution than ex situ measurements alone.

reconstructions with poor white and gray matter spatial coverage. In this work,
we propose a generative, autoencoder-based method, named GESTA (Generative
Sampling in Bundle Tractography using Autoencoders), that produces streamlines
achieving better spatial coverage. Compared to other deep learning methods, our
autoencoder-based framework uses a single model to generate streamlines in a
bundle-wise fashion, and does not require to propagate local orientations.
GESTA produces new and complete streamlines for any given white matter bundle,
including hard-to-track bundles. Applied on top of a given tractogram, GESTA is
shown to be effective in improving the white matter volume coverage in poorly
populated bundles, both on synthetic and human brain in vivo data. Our
streamline evaluation framework ensures that the streamlines produced by GESTA
are anatomically plausible and fit well to the local diffusion signal. The
streamline evaluation criteria assess anatomy (white matter coverage), local
orientation alignment (direction), and geometry features of streamlines, and
optionally, gray matter connectivity. GESTA is thus a novel deep generative
bundle tractography method that can be used to improve the tractography
reconstruction of the white matter.

remarkable similarities in the plane of the sky in terms of shape, size, and
extinction, California has an order of magnitude lower star formation
efficiency. We use our state-of-the-art dust mapping technique to derive the
detailed three-dimensional (3D) structure of the two clouds, taking into
account both distance and extinction uncertainties, and a full 3D spatial
correlation between neighbouring points. We discover that, despite the apparent
filamentary structure in the plane of the sky, California is a flat 120-pc-long
sheet extending from 410 to 530 $pc$. We show that not only Orion A and
California differ substantially in their 3D shapes, but also Orion A has
considerably higher density substructures in 3D than California. This result
presents a compelling reason why the two clouds have different star formation

This underlines the importance of 3D information in interpreting star formation

the best performance on test case prioritization tasks in the literature. We
evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers in predicting fault-detecting tests

structures. Physicalizations are an important component of anatomical and
biological education and edutainment. However, existing approaches have mainly
revolved around creating data sculptures through digital fabrication. Only a
few recent works proposed computer-aided pipelines for generating sculptures,
such as papercrafts, with affordable and readily available materials.
Papercraft generation remains a challenging topic by itself. Yet, anatomical
and biological applications pose additional challenges, such as reconstruction
complexity and insufficiency to account for multiple, nested structures--often
present in anatomical and biological structures. Our workflow comprises the
following steps: (i) define the nested configuration of the model and detect
its levels, (ii) calculate the viewpoint that provides optimal, unobstructed
views on inner levels, (iii) perform cuts on the outer levels to reveal the
inner ones based on the viewpoint selection, (iv) estimate the stability of the
cut papercraft to ensure a reliable outcome, (v) generate textures at each
level, as a smart visibility mechanism that provides additional information on
the inner structures, and (vi) unfold each textured mesh guaranteeing
reconstruction. Our novel approach exploits the interactivity of nested
papercraft models for edutainment purposes.

touching each other, posing a challenge for in-situ segmentation of on-branch

strong generalization capabilities, but it demands massive labeled data, which
is often a limitation, especially for agricultural applications. As lacking the
labeled data to train an in-situ segmentation model for on-branch soybean pods,
we propose a transfer learning from synthetic in-vitro soybean pods. First, we
present a novel automated image generation method to rapidly generate a
synthetic in-vitro soybean pods dataset with plenty of annotated samples. The
in-vitro soybean pods samples are overlapped to simulate the frequently
physically touching of on-branch soybean pods. Then, we design a two-step
transfer learning. In the first step, we finetune an instance segmentation
network pretrained by a source domain (MS COCO dataset) with a synthetic target
domain (in-vitro soybean pods dataset). In the second step, transferring from
simulation to reality is performed by finetuning on a few real-world mature
soybean plant samples. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the
proposed two-step transfer learning method, such that AP$_{50}$ was 0.80 for
the real-world mature soybean plant test dataset, which is higher than that of
direct adaptation and its AP$_{50}$ was 0.77. Furthermore, the visualizations
of in-situ segmentation results of on-branch soybean pods show that our method
performs better than other methods, especially when soybean pods overlap
densely.

has been realized that it also affects the macroscopic behavior of systems with
chiral fermions. In particular, the local imbalance between left- and
right-handed fermions in the presence of a magnetic field induces
non-dissipative transport of electric charge (""the Chiral Magnetic Effect"",
CME). In heavy ion collisions, there is an ongoing search for this effect at
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, with results from a dedicated isobar run
presented very recently. An observation of CME in heavy ion collisions could
shed light on the mechanism of baryon asymmetry generation in the Early
Universe. Recently, the CME has been discovered in Dirac and Weyl semimetals
possessing chiral quasi-particles. This observation opens a path towards
quantum sensors, and potentially a new kind of quantum computers.

train cattle identification frameworks. Evaluating the approach on the test
portion of the publicly available Cows2021 dataset, for training we use 23,350
frames across 435 single individual tracklets generated by automated oriented
cattle detection and tracking in operational farm footage. Self-supervised
metric learning is first employed to initialise a candidate identity space
where each tracklet is considered a distinct entity. Grouping entities into
equivalence classes representing cattle identities is then performed by
automated merging via cluster analysis and active learning. Critically, we
identify the inflection point at which automated choices cannot replicate
improvements based on human intervention to reduce annotation to a minimum.
Experimental results show that cluster analysis and a few minutes of labelling
after automated self-supervision can improve the test identification accuracy
of 153 identities to 92.44% (ARI=0.93) from the 74.9% (ARI=0.754) obtained by
self-supervision only. These promising results indicate that a tailored

highly effective whilst requiring only minimal labelling effort. We provide all

geometry built on 3D hexagonal, incompressible cells, we build a mapping
relating the cortical rheology to the monolayer tissue rheology. Our approach
shows that the tissue low frequency elastic modulus is proportional to the rest
tension of the cortex, as expected from the physics of liquid foams as well as
of tensegrity structures. A fractional visco-contractile cortex rheology is
predicted to yield a high-frequency fractional visco-elastic monolayer
rheology, where such a fractional behaviour has been recently observed
experimentally at each scale separately. In particular cases, the mapping may
be inverted, allowing to derive from a given tissue rheology the underlying
cortex rheology. Interestingly, applying the same approach to a 2D hexagonal
tiling fails, which suggests that the 2D character of planar cell cortex-based
models may be unsuitable to account for realistic monolayer rheologies. We
provide quantitative predictions, amenable to experimental tests through
standard perturbation assays of cortex constituents, and hope to foster new,

modelling and PDE model discovery. Leveraging the expressive power of deep
neural networks, especially in high dimensions, such methods learn the mapping
between functional state variables. While proposed methods have assumed noise
only in the dependent variables, experimental and numerical data for operator
learning typically exhibit noise in the independent variables as well, since
both variables represent signals that are subject to measurement error. In
regression on scalar data, failure to account for noisy independent variables
can lead to biased parameter estimates. With noisy independent variables,
linear models fitted via ordinary least squares (OLS) will show attenuation
bias, wherein the slope will be underestimated. In this work, we derive an
analogue of attenuation bias for linear operator regression with white noise in
both the independent and dependent variables. In the nonlinear setting, we
computationally demonstrate underprediction of the action of the Burgers
operator in the presence of noise in the independent variable. We propose
error-in-variables (EiV) models for two operator regression methods,
MOR-Physics and DeepONet, and demonstrate that these new models reduce bias in
the presence of noisy independent variables for a variety of operator learning
problems. Considering the Burgers operator in 1D and 2D, we demonstrate that
EiV operator learning robustly recovers operators in high-noise regimes that
defeat OLS operator learning. We also introduce an EiV model for time-evolving
PDE discovery and show that OLS and EiV perform similarly in learning the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky evolution operator from corrupted data, suggesting that
the effect of bias in OLS operator learning depends on the regularity of the
target operator.

individual BH-LMXBs a more consistent correlation is generally found.
Furthermore, we observe jet quenching for both types of LMXBs, but it is
unclear what exactly causes this, and if jets in NS-LMXBs quench as strongly as
those in BH-LMXBs. While additional soft X-ray spectral components can be
present for NS-LMXBs due to the presence of the neutron star's surface,
disentangling the individual X-ray spectral components has thus far not been
considered when studying the radio/X-ray coupling. Here we present eleven

and Comptonised spectral components in the Swift/XRT spectra, with the aim of
studying whether the presence of additional thermal emission affects the

significant thermal contribution in Swift/XRT spectra that could cause scatter
in the radio/X-ray coupling. However, a noteworthy finding is that the X-ray
observation with the strongest statistically significant thermal component

correctness-by-construction, ensuring robustness has remained a challenge.
Hence, in this paper, we address the robust-by-construction synthesis problem
by considering the specifications to be expressed by a robust version of Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL), called robust LTL (rLTL). rLTL has a many-valued
semantics to capture different degrees of satisfaction of a specification,
i.e., satisfaction is a quantitative notion.
  We argue that the current algorithms for rLTL synthesis do not compute
optimal strategies in a non-antagonistic setting. So, a natural question is
whether there is a way of satisfying the specification ""better"" if the
environment is indeed not antagonistic. We address this question by developing
two new notions of strategies. The first notion is that of adaptive strategies,
which, in response to the opponent's non-antagonistic moves, maximize the
degree of satisfaction. The idea is to monitor non-optimal moves of the
opponent at runtime using multiple parity automata and adaptively change the
system strategy to ensure optimality. The second notion is that of strongly
adaptive strategies, which is a further refinement of the first notion. These
strategies also maximize the opportunities for the opponent to make non-optimal
moves. We show that computing such strategies for rLTL specifications is not
harder than the standard synthesis problem, e.g., computing strategies with LTL
specifications, and takes doubly-exponential time.

mode in the transportation section in recent years. EVs have many advantages
compared to traditional transportation, especially the environmental aspect.
However, despite many EVs' benefits, operating EVs has limitations in their

The driving range of EVs is closely related to their energy consumption, which
is highly affected by exogenous and endogenous factors. Since those factors are
unpredictable, uncertainty in EVs' energy consumption should be considered for
efficient operation. This paper proposes an adaptive robust optimization
framework for the electric vehicle routing problem. The objective is to
minimize the worst-case energy consumption while guaranteeing that services are
delivered at the appointed time windows without battery level deficiency. We
postulate that EVs can be recharged en route, and the charging amount can be
adjusted depending on the circumstance. The proposed problem is formulated as a
two-stage adaptive robust problem. A column-and-constraint generation based
heuristic algorithm, which is cooperated with variable neighborhood search and
alternating direction algorithm, is proposed to solve the proposed model. The
computational results show the economic efficiency and robustness of the

greenhouse-gas-dominated atmosphere occurring when incoming solar radiation
exceeds infrared radiation emitted from the planet at the top of the

possibility of observing a Venus-like world and the possibility that Venus
could represent an end-state of evolution for habitable worlds, requires an
improved understanding of the Venus-like planet; specifically, the distances
where these planets can exist. Understanding this helps us define a ""Venus

information about users. Given a number of egregious privacy breaches, there is
a clear unmet need for greater transparency and control over data collection,
sharing, and use by smart speaker platforms as well as third party skills
supported on them. To bridge the gap, we build an auditing framework that
leverages online advertising to measure data collection, its usage, and its
sharing by the smart speaker platforms. We evaluate our framework on the Amazon
smart speaker ecosystem. Our results show that Amazon and third parties
(including advertising and tracking services) collect smart speaker interaction
data. We find that Amazon processes voice data to infer user interests and uses
it to serve targeted ads on-platform (Echo devices) as well as off-platform
(web). Smart speaker interaction leads to as much as 30X higher ad bids from
advertisers. Finally, we find that Amazon's and skills' operational practices
are often not clearly disclosed in their privacy policies.

distinct algorithms, rooted in two ""modes"" -- forward and reverse -- which are
typically presented (and implemented) separately. Can there be only one?
Following up on the AD systems developed in the JAX and Dex projects, we
formalize a decomposition of reverse-mode AD into (i) forward-mode AD followed
by (ii) unzipping the linear and non-linear parts and then (iii) transposition
of the linear part.
  To that end, we define a (substructurally) linear type system that can prove
a class of functions are (algebraically) linear. Our main results are that
forward-mode AD produces such linear functions, and that we can unzip and
transpose any such linear function, conserving cost, size, and linearity.
Composing these three transformations recovers reverse-mode AD. This
decomposition also sheds light on checkpointing, which emerges naturally from a
free choice in unzipping `let` expressions. As a corollary, checkpointing
techniques are applicable to general-purpose partial evaluation, not just AD.
  We hope that our formalization will lead to a deeper understanding of
automatic differentiation and that it will simplify implementations, by
separating the concerns of differentiation proper from the concerns of gaining
efficiency (namely, separating the derivative computation from the act of
running it backward).

electron transport through a disordered medium. It is formed when a
defect/scatterer reflects an impinging electron causing negative charges to
build up on one side of the scatterer and positive charges on the other. This
results in the formation of a microscopic electric dipole that affects the
resistivity of the medium. Here, we show that an equivalent entity forms in
spin polarized electron transport through the surface of a disordered
topological insulator (TI). When electrons reflect from a scatterer on the TI
surface, a spin imbalance forms around the scatterer, resulting in a spin
current that flows either in the same or the opposite direction as the injected
spin current and hence either increases or decreases the spin resistivity. It
also destroys spin-momentum locking and produces a magnetic field around the
scatterer. The latter will cause transiting spins to precess as they pass the
scatterer, thereby radiating electromagnetic waves and implementing an
oscillator. If an alternating current is passed through the TI instead of a
static current, the magnetic field will oscillate with the frequency of the
current and radiate electromagnetic waves of the same frequency, thus making
the scatterer act as a miniature antenna.

wireless power transfer system remains a fundamentally important challenge.
This challenge becomes even more critical when transferring power to groups of
inductively coupled receivers. We propose a method for efficient wireless power
transfer to multiple receivers exploiting the concept of exceptional points of
degeneracy (EPD). In previous studies based on PT symmetry, a receiver's
operation has been divided into two strong and weak coupling regimes, and the
power transfer efficiency is constant in the strong coupling regime when
varying the coupling factor.Here the concept of strong and weak coupling and
constant power efficiency is extended to a system of multiple receivers that do
not follow PT symmetry. We show that the important feature to have a roughly
constant power efficiency, independently of the positions of the receivers, is
the existence of an EPD that separates the weak and strong regimes. Our
proposed method demonstrates a system with less sensitivity to the coupling
change than a conventional system without EPD when the receivers and their
couplings to the transmitter are not necessarily identical.

demonstrate the merit of Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling for inverse problems

compute for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in the DAG a lowest common
ancestor (LCA) of $u$ and $v$ if one exists. In this paper we study several
interesting variants of AP-LCA, providing both algorithms and fine-grained
lower bounds for them. The lower bounds we obtain are the first conditional
lower bounds for LCA problems higher than $n^{\omega-o(1)}$, where $\omega$ is
the matrix multiplication exponent. Some of our results include:
  - In any DAG, we can detect all vertex pairs that have at most two LCAs and
list all of their LCAs in $O(n^\omega)$ time. This algorithm extends a result
of [Kowaluk and Lingas ESA'07] which showed an $\tilde{O}(n^\omega)$ time
algorithm that detects all pairs with a unique LCA in a DAG and outputs their
corresponding LCAs.
  - Listing $7$ LCAs per vertex pair in DAGs requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time under
the popular assumption that 3-uniform 5-hyperclique detection requires
$n^{5-o(1)}$ time. This is surprising since essentially cubic time is
sufficient to list all LCAs (if $\omega=2$).
  - Counting the number of LCAs for every vertex pair in a DAG requires
$n^{3-o(1)}$ time under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, and
$n^{\omega(1,2,1)-o(1)}$ time under the $4$-Clique hypothesis. This shows that
the algorithm of [Echkardt, M\""{u}hling and Nowak ESA'07] for listing all LCAs
for every pair of vertices is likely optimal.
  - Given a DAG and a vertex $w_{u,v}$ for every vertex pair $u,v$, verifying
whether all $w_{u,v}$ are valid LCAs requires $n^{2.5-o(1)}$ time assuming
3-uniform 4-hyperclique requires $n^{4 - o(1)}$ time. This defies the common
intuition that verification is easier than computation since returning some LCA
per vertex pair can be solved in $O(n^{2.447})$ time [Grandoni et al. SODA'21].

introduce a new evasive attack, DIVA, that exploits these differences in edge

particularly dangerous, because the malicious input will trick the adapted

differentiable programming for robot design optimization with a novel

framework can conduct end-to-end optimization and robustness certification for
robotics systems, enabling simultaneous optimization of navigation, perception,

  Using simulation and hardware experiments, we show how our tool can be used
to solve practical problems in robotics. First, we optimize sensor placements
for robot navigation (a design with 5 subsystems and 6 tunable parameters) in
under 5 minutes to achieve an 8.4x performance improvement compared to the
initial design. Second, we solve a multi-agent collaborative manipulation task

improvement over the initial design. We find that differentiable programming
enables much faster (32% and 20x, respectively for each example) optimization

avoiding the assumption that users write or select optimal queries. We

into a Mott insulator in the context of moir\'e bilayers. We consider two
moir\'e layers coupled together only through inter-layer repulsion and there is
a U(2)$\times$ U(2) symmetry. The densities of the two layers can be tuned to
be $n_t=x,n_b=1-x$ with $n_t+n_b=1$. $x=0$ limit is a layer polarized Mott
insulator and small $x$ regime can be reached by doping inter-layer excitons at
density $x$. Charge gap can remain finite at small $x$, as is demonstrated
experimentally in the WSe$_2$-hBN-WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ system. To capture the
intertwinement of the spin and exciton degree of freedom, we propose a
four-flavor spin model. In addition to the obvious possibility of single
exciton condensation phase, we also identified more exotic physics with
fractionalization: (I) We define spin gap $\Delta_t, \Delta_b$ for the two
layers respectively. As long as the spin gap at either layer is finite, single
exciton condensation is impossible and we can only have paired exciton
condensation. If both spin gaps are finite, it can be a fractional exciton
superfluid with paired exciton condensation coexisting with $Z_2$ spin liquid.
Numerical evidences for such a phase will be provided. (II) If the layer
polarized Mott insulator at $x=0$ is in a U(1) spin liquid with spinon Fermi
surface, the natural phase at $x>0$ hosts neutral Fermi surface formed by
fermionic excitons. There are metallic counter-flow transport and also Friedel

understand the connection between the two modalities. For a pair of video and

similarity. A good multi-modality encoder should be able to well capture both
inputs' semantics and encode them in the shared feature space where embedding
distance gets properly translated into their semantic similarity. In this work,
we focused on this semantic connection between video and language, and
developed a multi-level alignment training scheme to directly shape the
encoding process. Global and segment levels of video-language alignment pairs
were designed, based on the information similarity ranging from high-level
context to fine-grained semantics. The contrastive loss was used to contrast
the encodings' similarities between the positive and negative alignment pairs,
and to ensure the network is trained in such a way that similar information is
encoded closely in the shared feature space while information of different
semantics is kept apart. Our multi-level alignment training can be applied to
various video-and-language grounding tasks. Together with the task-specific
training loss, our framework achieved comparable performance to previous
state-of-the-arts on multiple video QA and retrieval datasets.

significant accuracy improvements in a myriad of application domains at the
cost of larger and more compute-intensive models. Training such models on
massive amounts of data typically requires scaling to many compute nodes and
relies heavily on collective communication algorithms, such as all-reduce, to
exchange the weight gradients between different nodes. The overhead of these
collective communication operations in a distributed AI training system can
bottleneck its performance, with more pronounced effects as the number of nodes
increases. In this paper, we first characterize the all-reduce operation
overhead by profiling distributed AI training. Then, we propose a new smart
network interface card (NIC) for distributed AI training systems using
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate all-reduce operations and
optimize network bandwidth utilization via data compression. The AI smart NIC
frees up the system's compute resources to perform the more compute-intensive
tensor operations and increases the overall node-to-node communication
efficiency. We perform real measurements on a prototype distributed AI training
system comprised of 6 compute nodes to evaluate the performance gains of our
proposed FPGA-based AI smart NIC compared to a baseline system with regular
NICs. We also use these measurements to validate an analytical model that we
formulate to predict performance when scaling to larger systems. Our proposed

statistical properties of the discharge, inferred from high resolution, large
sample-size current waveforms. The key properties of the current pulsations,
namely inter-pulse period, peak current, deposited energy, and pulse width are
analyzed as a function of wind speed and applied DC voltage. All parameters
increase in dispersion with wind speed. The mean of the inter-pulse period
decreases with wind speed and the mean pulsation frequency increases. The peak
currents and energies per pulsation have a general tendency to decrease in
magnitude but also higher-current, higher-energy, streamer bursts are observed.
At low wind speeds, streamers preferentially propagate in the downwind
direction but, as the wind speed is increased, more streamers can propagate
upwind. Synchronized imaging reveals correlations between the streamer

to form a set of incompatible measurements. Every set of incompatible

discrimination task where one prepares a state from an ensemble and sends it to
another party, and the latter tries to detect the state using available
measurements. We consider the local quantum state discrimination task where a
sender prepares a bipartite state and sends the subsystems to two receivers.
The receivers try to detect the sent state using locally incompatible
measurements. We analyze the ratio of the probability of successfully guessing
the state using incompatible measurements and the maximum probability of
successfully guessing the state using compatible measurements. We find that
this ratio is upper bounded by a simple function of robustnesses of
incompatibilities of the local measurements. Interestingly, corresponding to
every pair of sets of incompatible measurements, there exists at least one
local state discrimination task where this bound can be achieved. We argue that
the optimal local quantum state discrimination task does not present any

ratios, of probabilities of successful detection via incompatible and
compatible measurements, in global and local state discriminations. The results
can be generalized to the regime of multipartite local quantum state

Even though
mounting observational evidence points towards a magnetospheric origin of FRB
emission, the question of the location for FRB generation continues to be
debated. One argument suggested against the magnetospheric origin of bright
FRBs is that the radio waves associated with an FRB may lose most of their
energy before escaping the magnetosphere because the cross-section for $e^\pm$
to scatter large-amplitude EM waves in the presence of a strong magnetic field
is much larger than the Thompson cross-section. We have investigated this
suggestion and find that FRB radiation traveling through the open field line
region of a magnetar's magnetosphere does not suffer much loss due to two
previously ignored factors. First, the plasma in the outer magnetosphere ($r
\gta 10^9 \ $cm), where the losses are potentially most severe, is likely to be
flowing outward at a high Lorentz factor $\gamma_p \geq 10^3$. Second, the
angle between the wave vector and the magnetic field vector, $\theta_B$, in the
outer magnetosphere is likely of the order of 0.1 radian or smaller due in part
to the intense FRB pulse that tilts open magnetic field lines so that they get
aligned with the pulse propagation direction. Both these effects reduce the
interaction between the FRB pulse and the plasma substantially. We find that a
bright FRB with an isotropic luminosity $L_{\rm frb} \gta 10^{42} \ {\rm erg \
s^{-1}}$ can escape the magnetosphere unscathed for a large section of the
$\gamma_p-\theta_B$ parameter space, and therefore conclude that the generation
of FRBs in magnetar magnetosphere passes this test.

whether VCG yields the best efficiency in this setting, or whether the PoA can
be improved upon. We present a prior-free randomized auction in which the PoA
is approx. 1.896 for the case of two bidders, proving that one can achieve an
efficiency strictly better than that under VCG in this setting. We also provide
a stark impossibility result for the problem in general as the number of
bidders increases -- we show that no (randomized) anonymous truthful auction
can have a PoA strictly better than 2 asymptotically as the number of bidders
per query increases. While it was shown in previous work that one can improve
on the PoA of 2 if the auction is allowed to use the bidder's values for the
queries in addition to the bidder's bids, we note that our randomized auction
is prior-free and does not use such additional information; our impossibility

Related features are grouped together via recurrent connections between
neurons, with salient objects emerging via sparse regularization. VARS adopts
an attractor network with recurrent connections that converges toward a stable
pattern over time. Network layers are represented as ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), formulating attention as a recurrent attractor network that
equivalently optimizes the sparse reconstruction of input using a dictionary of
""templates"" encoding underlying patterns of data. We show that self-attention
is a special case of VARS with a single-step optimization and no sparsity

origin-destination pairs based on a simplified and generic utility function.
Typically, the utility function consists of travel time solely and its
coefficients are equated to estimates obtained from stated preference data.
While this modeling strategy is reasonable, the inherent sampling bias in
individual-level data may be further amplified over network flow aggregation,
leading to inaccurate flow estimates. This data must be collected from surveys
or travel diaries, which may be labor intensive, costly and limited to a small
time period. To address these limitations, this study extends classical
bi-level formulations to estimate travelers' utility functions with multiple
attributes using system-level data. We formulate a methodology grounded on
non-linear least squares to statistically infer travelers' utility function in
the network context using traffic counts, traffic speeds, traffic incidents and
sociodemographic information, among other attributes. The analysis of the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem and of its pseudo-convexity
motivate the use of normalized gradient descent. We also develop a hypothesis
test framework to examine statistical properties of the utility function
coefficients and to perform attributes selection. Experiments on synthetic data
show that the coefficients are consistently recovered and that hypothesis tests
are a reliable statistic to identify which attributes are determinants of
travelers' route choices. Besides, a series of Monte-Carlo experiments suggest
that statistical inference is robust to noise in the Origin-Destination matrix
and in the traffic counts, and to various levels of sensor coverage. The
methodology is also deployed at a large scale using real-world multi-source
data in Fresno, CA collected before and during the COVID-19 outbreak.

estimation by combining the treatment model and the outcome model via different
vehicles, such as matching, weighting, and regression. The key advantage of
doubly robust estimators is that they require either the treatment model or the
outcome model to be correctly specified to obtain a consistent estimator of
average treatment effects, and therefore lead to a more accurate and often more
precise inference. However, little work has been done to understand how doubly
robust estimators differ due to their unique strategies of using the treatment
and outcome models and how machine learning techniques can be combined to boost
their performance. Here we examine multiple popular doubly robust methods and
compare their performance using different treatment and outcome modeling via
extensive simulations and a real-world application. We found that incorporating
machine learning with doubly robust estimators such as the targeted maximum
likelihood estimator gives the best overall performance. Practical guidance on
how to apply doubly robust estimators is provided.

the CycleGAN architecture to transfer the knowledge from one domain

Similar as in comparative effectiveness studies, health economic evaluations
that consider subject-level heterogeneity produce individualized treatment
rules (ITRs) that are often more cost-effective than one-size-fits-all
treatment. Thus, it is of great interest to develop statistical tools for
learning such a cost-effective ITR (CE-ITR) under the causal inference
framework that allows proper handling of potential confounding and can be
applied to both trials and observational studies. In this paper, we use the
concept of net-monetary-benefit (NMB) to assess the trade-off between health
benefits and related costs. We estimate CE-ITR as a function of patients'
characteristics that, when implemented, optimizes the allocation of limited
healthcare resources by maximizing health gains while minimizing
treatment-related costs. We employ the conditional random forest approach and
identify the optimal CE-ITR using NMB-based classification algorithms, where
two partitioned estimators are proposed for the subject-specific weights to
effectively incorporate information from censored individuals. We conduct
simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposals. We apply our
top-performing algorithm to the NIH-funded Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention

pay attention to an emerging editing technique called image recoloring, which
can manipulate the color values of an image to give it a new style. To prevent
it from being used maliciously, the previous approaches address the
conventional recoloring from the perspective of inter-channel correlation and
illumination consistency. In this paper, we try to explore a solution from the
perspective of the spatial correlation, which exhibits the generic detection
capability for both conventional and deep learning-based recoloring. Through
theoretical and numerical analysis, we find that the recoloring operation will
inevitably destroy the spatial correlation between pixels, implying a new prior
of statistical discriminability. Based on such fact, we generate a set of
spatial correlation features and learn the informative representation from the
set via a convolutional neural network. To train our network, we use three
recoloring methods to generate a large-scale and high-quality data set.
Extensive experimental results in two recoloring scenes demonstrate that the
spatial correlation features are highly discriminative. Our method achieves the
state-of-the-art detection accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets and exhibits

optical couplers to extract their feature representations. Each DPU comprises
successive passive layers of metalines to modulate the electromagnetic optical
field via diffraction, where the metaline structures are learnable parameters
shared across graph nodes. DGNN captures complex dependencies among the node
neighborhoods and eliminates the nonlinear transition functions during the
light-speed optical message passing over graph structures. We demonstrate the
use of DGNN extracted features for node and graph-level classification tasks

speed up high-dimensional models by discarding the inactive features with zero

achieve significant speedup without any loss of accuracy by simultaneously
enjoying the sparsity of the model and dataset. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work of distributed safe dynamic screening method.
Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method achieves the linear

extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the superiority of

limited amount of data and labels, which makes learning ineffective. Federated
learning (FL) can help in this regard by learning a shared model while keeping
training data local for privacy. Traditional FL requires fully-labeled data for
training, which is inconvenient or sometimes infeasible to obtain due to high
labeling cost and the requirement of expertise. Contrastive learning (CL), as a
self-supervised learning approach, can effectively learn from unlabeled data to
pre-train a neural network encoder, followed by fine-tuning for downstream
tasks with limited annotations. However, when adopting CL in FL, the limited
data diversity on each client makes federated contrastive learning (FCL)
ineffective. In this work, we propose an FCL framework for volumetric medical
image segmentation with limited annotations. More specifically, we exchange the
features in the FCL pre-training process such that diverse contrastive data are
provided to each site for effective local CL while keeping raw data private.
Based on the exchanged features, global structural matching further leverages
the structural similarity to align local features to the remote ones such that
a unified feature space can be learned among different sites. Experiments on a

highly directional beams are adapted to compensate for the substantial

have some errors such as GPS errors. In any case, some uncertainty, and
localization error is unavoidable in most settings. Applying these distorted
locations for clustering will increase the error of beam management. Meanwhile,
the traffic demand may change dynamically in the wireless environment.
Therefore, a scheme that can handle both the uncertainty of localization and
dynamic radio resource allocation is needed. In this paper, we propose a
UK-means-based clustering and deep reinforcement learning-based resource
allocation algorithm (UK-DRL) for radio resource allocation and beam management
in 5G mmWave networks. We first apply UK-means as the clustering algorithm to
mitigate the localization uncertainty, then deep reinforcement learning (DRL)

  Regrets of the violation of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of OPMM for solving

communications security. Accurate frame detection models assist vehicles to
avoid malicious attacks. Uncertainty and diversity regarding attack methods
make this task challenging. However, the existing works have the limitation of
only considering local features or the weak feature mapping of multi-features.
To address these limitations, we present a novel model for automotive intrusion
detection by spatial-temporal correlation features of in-vehicle communication
traffic (STC-IDS). Specifically, the proposed model exploits an
encoding-detection architecture. In the encoder part, spatial and temporal
relations are encoded simultaneously. To strengthen the relationship between
features, the attention-based convolutional network still captures spatial and
channel features to increase the receptive field, while attention-LSTM builds
meaningful relationships from previous time series or crucial bytes. The
encoded information is then passed to detector for generating forceful
spatial-temporal attention features and enabling anomaly classification. In
particular, single-frame and multi-frame models are constructed to present
different advantages respectively. Under automatic hyper-parameter selection
based on Bayesian optimization, the model is trained to attain the best
performance. Extensive empirical studies based on a real-world vehicle attack
dataset demonstrate that STC-IDS has outperformed baseline methods and obtains
fewer false-alarm rates while maintaining efficiency.

incipient symmetry-broken phase in graphene at the millimetre scale. We show
that an extremely dilute concentration ($<\!0.3\% $) of surface adatoms can
self-assemble and trigger the collapse of the graphene atomic lattice into a
distinct Kekul\'e bond density wave phase, whereby the carbon C-C bond symmetry
is broken globally. Using complementary momentum-resolved techniques such as

that this Kekul\'e density wave phase occurs for various Fermi surface sizes

post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of this modified theory of gravity. It is shown
that in addition to the Newtonian potential, a new EMSG potential affects the
trajectory of photons. As a result, in this theory, photons do not behave as
predicted by general relativity (GR). To evaluate the EMSG theory by the solar
system tests, we study light deflection and Shapiro time delay. Regarding the
results obtained in \cite{bertotti2003test,shapiro2004measurement}, we restrict
the free parameter of the theory and show that it lies within the range
$-4.0\times 10^{-27}\, \text{m}\,\text{s}^2\,\text{kg}^{-1} < f_0' < 8.7\times
10^{-26}\,\text{m}\,\text{s}^2\,\text{kg}^{-1}$. This interval is in agreement
with those derived in \cite{nazari2020Constraining,akarsu2018constraint}. This
consistency manifests that this theory passes these solar system tests with
flying colors. Interestingly, it turns out that the magnitude of the EMSG
correction strongly depends on the density of the deflector. So, we investigate
the possible effects of EMSG on images of a light source microlensed by a
compact dense object such as neutron stars. It is estimated that the EMSG
correction to the position of lensed images could be as large as $(1-0.1)$
micro-arcseconds which may be detected by future high-resolution missions.
Moreover, the total magnification and the shape of light curves are obtained in
the EMSG theory. It is revealed that except for a small deviation, the overall
behavior of the EMSG light curves is similar to that in GR.

weak-field model. The strong magnetic fields help trigger a neutrino-driven
explosion early on, which results in a rapid rise and saturation of the
explosion energy. Dynamically, the strong initial field leads to a fast
build-up of magnetic fields in the gain region to 40% of kinetic equipartition
and also creates sizable pre-shock ram pressure perturbations that are known to
be conducive to asymmetric shock expansion. For the strong-field model, we find
an extrapolated neutron star kick of ~350 km/s, a spin period of ~70 ms, and no
spin-kick alignment. The dipole field strength of the proto-neutron star is 2 x

surface dipole field in the weak-field model is stronger, which argues against
a straightforward connection between pre-collapse fields and the birth magnetic

State-of-the-art methods leverage large datasets to first learn local context
priors that are represented as neural network-based signed distance functions
(SDFs) with some parameters encoding the local contexts. To reconstruct a
surface at a specific query location at inference time, these methods then
match the local reconstruction target by searching for the best match in the
local prior space (by optimizing the parameters encoding the local context) at
the given query location. However, this requires the local context prior to
generalize to a wide variety of unseen target regions, which is hard to
achieve. To resolve this issue, we introduce Predictive Context Priors by
learning Predictive Queries for each specific point cloud at inference time.
Specifically, we first train a local context prior using a large point cloud
dataset similar to previous techniques. For surface reconstruction at inference
time, however, we specialize the local context prior into our Predictive
Context Prior by learning Predictive Queries, which predict adjusted spatial
query locations as displacements of the original locations. This leads to a
global SDF that fits the specific point cloud the best. Intuitively, the query
prediction enables us to flexibly search the learned local context prior over
the entire prior space, rather than being restricted to the fixed query
locations, and this improves the generalizability. Our method does not require
ground truth signed distances, normals, or any additional procedure of signed
distance fusion across overlapping regions. Our experimental results in surface
reconstruction for single shapes or complex scenes show significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art under widely used benchmarks.

domain and the target domain. To alleviate the problem of the lack of
supervised labels for the source images, cycle-consistency based methods have
been proposed for image structure preservation by assuming a reversible
relationship between unpaired images. However, this assumption only uses
limited correspondence between image pairs. Recently, contrastive learning (CL)
has been used to further investigate the image correspondence in unpaired image
translation by using patch-based positive/negative learning. Patch-based
contrastive routines obtain the positives by self-similarity computation and
recognize the rest patches as negatives. This flexible learning paradigm
obtains auxiliary contextualized information at a low cost. As the negatives
own an impressive sample number, with curiosity, we make an investigation based
on a question: are all negatives necessary for feature contrastive learning?
Unlike previous CL approaches that use negatives as much as possible, in this
paper, we study the negatives from an information-theoretic perspective and
introduce a new negative Pruning technology for Unpaired image-to-image
Translation (PUT) by sparsifying and ranking the patches. The proposed
algorithm is efficient, flexible and enables the model to learn essential
information between corresponding patches stably. By putting quality over
quantity, only a few negative patches are required to achieve better results.

volume-deflection and volume-capture characteristics. To these belongs the
angular alignment of the crystal with respect to the nominal beam direction.
The continuum potential picture has been utilized. The simulation results were
compared with experiments. It turns out that the assumption of an anticlastic
bending of the crystal, bent on the principle of the quasi-mosaic effect, is
not required to reproduce the experimental observations.

outdoor and indoor applications ranging from autonomous driving to indoor

GPS. For indoor applications, the LiDAR technique does not satisfy the accuracy
requirement and the GPS signals will be lost. An accurate and efficient scene
sensing technique is required for indoor SLAM. As the most promising 3D sensing
technique, the opportunities for indoor SLAM with fringe projection
profilometry (FPP) systems are obvious, but methods to date have not fully
leveraged the accuracy and speed of sensing that such systems offer. In this
paper, we propose a novel FPP-based indoor SLAM method based on the coordinate
transformation relationship of FPP, where the 2D-to-3D descriptor-assisted is
used for mapping and localization. The correspondences generated by matching
descriptors are used for fast and accurate mapping, and the transform
estimation between the 2D and 3D descriptors is used to localize the sensor.
The provided experimental results demonstrate that the proposed indoor SLAM can
achieve the localization and mapping accuracy around one millimeter.

we show that it is indeed possible to steal Machine Learning models by
accessing only top-1 predictions (Hard Label setting) as well, without access
to model gradients (Black-Box setting) or even the training dataset (Data-Free

trains the student and generator in tandem to steal the model effectively while
overcoming the challenge of the hard label setting by utilizing gradients of
the clone network as a proxy to the victim's gradients. We propose to overcome
the large query costs associated with a typical Data-Free setting by utilizing
publicly available (potentially unrelated) datasets as a weak image prior. We
additionally show that even in the absence of such data, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art results within a low query budget using synthetically

workload model for a rasterization-based graphics Application Programming
Interface (API) pipeline, named GAMORRA, which works based on the load and
complexity of each stage of the pipeline. Firstly, GAMORRA models each stage of
the pipeline based on their operation complexity and the input data size. Then,
the calculated workloads of the stages are fed to a Multiple Linear Regression

is proposed as well to train the model. A suite of benchmarks is also designed
to tune the model parameters based on the performance of the target system. The
experiments were performed on Direct3D 11 and on two different rendering
platforms comparing GAMORRA to an AutoRegressive (AR) model, a Frame Complexity

of 1.27 ms frame rendering time estimation error (9.45%) compared to an average

questions like ""Why the GNN model makes a certain prediction?"". Feature
attribution is a prevalent technique of highlighting the explanatory subgraph
in the input graph, which plausibly leads the GNN model to make its prediction.
Various attribution methods exploit gradient-like or attention scores as the
attributions of edges, then select the salient edges with top attribution
scores as the explanation. However, most of these works make an untenable
assumption - the selected edges are linearly independent - thus leaving the
dependencies among edges largely unexplored, especially their coalition effect.
We demonstrate unambiguous drawbacks of this assumption - making the
explanatory subgraph unfaithful and verbose. To address this challenge, we
propose a reinforcement learning agent, Reinforced Causal Explainer
(RC-Explainer). It frames the explanation task as a sequential decision process
- an explanatory subgraph is successively constructed by adding a salient edge
to connect the previously selected subgraph. Technically, its policy network
predicts the action of edge addition, and gets a reward that quantifies the
action's causal effect on the prediction. Such reward accounts for the
dependency of the newly-added edge and the previously-added edges, thus
reflecting whether they collaborate together and form a coalition to pursue
better explanations. As such, RC-Explainer is able to generate faithful and
concise explanations, and has a better generalization power to unseen graphs.
When explaining different GNNs on three graph classification datasets,
RC-Explainer achieves better or comparable performance to SOTA approaches
w.r.t. predictive accuracy and contrastivity, and safely passes sanity checks
and visual inspections. Codes are available at

this, such mechanical properties and mechanisms are explored on example of
gallium telluride (GaTe), a promising optoelectronic candidate with an

Considering the driving force insufficient in atomic force microscopy

investigated through full-scale Berkovich-tip nanoindentation, micro-Raman
spectroscopy, AFM, and scanning electron microscopy. An unusual concurrence of
multiple pop-in and load-drop events in loading curve was observed. By further
correlating to molecular dynamics calculations, this concurrence was unveiled
originating from the interlayer sliding mediated layers-by-layers fracture
mechanism within GaTe multilayers. The van der Waals force between GaTe
multilayers and substrates was revealed much stronger than that between GaTe

limited by the nature of supervised training, most existing separation methods
require ground-truth sources and are trained on synthetic datasets. This
ground-truth reliance is problematic, because the ground-truth signals are
usually unavailable in real conditions. Moreover, in many industry scenarios,
the real acoustic characteristics deviate far from the ones in simulated
datasets. Therefore, the performance usually degrades significantly when
applying the supervised speech separation models to real applications. To
address these problems, in this study, we propose a novel separation
consistency training, termed SCT, to exploit the real-world unlabeled mixtures
for improving cross-domain unsupervised speech separation in an iterative
manner, by leveraging upon the complementary information obtained from
heterogeneous (structurally distinct but behaviorally complementary) models.
SCT follows a framework using two heterogeneous neural networks (HNNs) to
produce high confidence pseudo labels of unlabeled real speech mixtures. These
labels are then updated, and used to refine the HNNs to produce more reliable
consistent separation results for real mixture pseudo-labeling. To maximally
utilize the large complementary information between different separation
networks, a cross-knowledge adaptation is further proposed. Together with
simulated dataset, those real mixtures with high confidence pseudo labels are
then used to update the HNN separation models iteratively. In addition, we find
that combing the heterogeneous separation outputs by a simple linear fusion can
further slightly improve the final system performance.

industry-academia collaboration that enable the culture of participative
knowledge creation. Method: We conducted participant observation collecting
qualitative data spanning 8 years of collaborative research between a software
engineering research group on software V&V and the Norwegian IT sector. The
collected data was analyzed and synthesized into a practical collaboration
model, named the Certus Model. Results: The model is structured in seven
phases, describing activities from setting up research projects to the
exploitation of research results. As such, the Certus model advances other
collaborations models from literature by delineating different phases covering
the complete life cycle of participative research knowledge creation.
Conclusion: The Certus model describes the elements of a research collaboration
process between researchers and practitioners in software engineering, grounded
on the principles of research knowledge co-creation and continuous commitment
to joint problem solving. The model can be applied and tested in other contexts
where it may be adapted to the local context through experimentation.

shifts between training and test scenarios. For a new in-distribution (ID)
dataset, existing methods require retraining to capture the dataset-specific
feature representation or data distribution. In this paper, we propose a deep
generative models (DGM) based transferable OOD detection method, which is
unnecessary to retrain on a new ID dataset. We design an image erasing strategy
to equip exclusive conditional entropy distribution for each ID dataset, which
determines the discrepancy of DGM's posteriori ucertainty distribution on
different ID datasets. Owing to the powerful representation capacity of
convolutional neural networks, the proposed model trained on complex dataset
can capture the above discrepancy between ID datasets without retraining and
thus achieve transferable OOD detection. We validate the proposed method on
five datasets and verity that ours achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art group based OOD detection methods that need to be retrained to
deploy on new ID datasets. Our code is available at

In this work, we design a series of high temperature superconductors that can

Yb/Lu into sodalite-like clathrate hydrides. In particular, the critical
temperatures of Y3LuH24, YLuH12 and YLu3H24 are 283 K, 275 K and 288 K,
respectively, which are close to or have reached room temperature, and the
required pressure for stabilization of these hydrides is about 120 GPa which is

standard multimode fibers (MMFs) is proposed according to the comprehensive
study of the characteristics of the MMFs. The temperature and strain
dependences on the core diameter, numerical aperture (NA), and the length of
the MMF section in the single-mode--multimode--single-mode (SMS) fiber
structure are investigated experimentally. The results indicate that the larger
core diameter of the MMF leads to higher temperature sensitivity but lower
strain sensitivity (absolute values); the higher NA does not influence the
temperature sensitivity but results in higher absolute value of strain
sensitivity; the longer MMF section brings lower temperature sensitivity but
does not have an impact on strain sensitivity. These findings also contribute
to the theoretical analysis of the length dependence in the SMS fiber sensors.
Besides, the results of the characterization study show that the strain
sensitivity is relatively low, which brings a possibility to develop a
strain-insensitive temperature sensor. The proposed sensor is used for
temperature sensing while the strain is constantly applied from 0 to 1100
$\mu\epsilon$ with steps of 100 $\mu\epsilon$. The measured results are
consistent with the comprehensive study. The mean temperature sensitivity is
6.14 pm/$^{\circ}$C with a standard deviation of 0.39 pm/$^{\circ}$C, which
proves that the proposed temperature sensor exhibits good stability and is
insensitive to strain. We expect that these results will provide a profound
guideline to fiber sensors based on multimode interference.

(architectures and layers). To solve a given task, a network requires a certain
set of abilities reflected in its structure. The required abilities depend on
each task. There is so far no systematic study of the real capacities of the
proposed neural structures. The question of what each structure can and cannot
achieve is only partially answered by its performance on common benchmarks.
Indeed, natural data contain complex unknown statistical cues. It is therefore
impossible to know what cues a given neural structure is taking advantage of in
such data. In this work, we sketch a methodology to measure the effect of each
structure on a network's ability, by designing ad hoc synthetic datasets. Each
dataset is tailored to assess a given ability and is reduced to its simplest
form: each input contains exactly the amount of information needed to solve the
task. We illustrate our methodology by building three datasets to evaluate each
of the three following network properties: a) the ability to link local cues to
distant inferences, b) the translation covariance and c) the ability to group
pixels with the same characteristics and share information among them. Using a
first simplified depth estimation dataset, we pinpoint a serious nonlocal
deficit of the U-Net. We then evaluate how to resolve this limitation by
embedding its structure with nonlocal layers, which allow computing complex
features with long-range dependencies. Using a second dataset, we compare
different positional encoding methods and use the results to further improve
the U-Net on the depth estimation task. The third introduced dataset serves to
demonstrate the need for self-attention-like mechanisms for resolving more
realistic depth estimation tasks.

effectively leverage various side information to enhance the performance of
next-item prediction. Most state-of-the-art methods build on self-attention
networks and focus on exploring various solutions to integrate the item
embedding and side information embeddings before the attention layer. However,
our analysis shows that the early integration of various types of embeddings
limits the expressiveness of attention matrices due to a rank bottleneck and
constrains the flexibility of gradients. Also, it involves mixed correlations
among the different heterogeneous information resources, which brings extra
disturbance to attention calculation. Motivated by this, we propose Decoupled
Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation (DIF-SR), which moves the
side information from the input to the attention layer and decouples the
attention calculation of various side information and item representation. We
theoretically and empirically show that the proposed solution allows
higher-rank attention matrices and flexible gradients to enhance the modeling
capacity of side information fusion. Also, auxiliary attribute predictors are
proposed to further activate the beneficial interaction between side
information and item representation learning. Extensive experiments on four

search for $CP$ violation in $\Lambda$ decay is performed in the difference
between $CP$-odd decay parameters $\alpha_{-}$ for $\Lambda \rightarrow p\pi^-$
and $\alpha_{+}$ for $\bar\Lambda \rightarrow \bar{p}\pi^+$ by using the
process $e^+e^- \to J/\psi \rightarrow \Lambda \bar\Lambda $. With a
five-dimensional fit to the full angular distributions of the daughter baryon,
the most precise values for the decay parameters are determined to be
$\alpha_{-} = 0.7519 \pm 0.0036 \pm 0.0024$ and $\alpha_{+} = -0.7559 \pm
0.0036 \pm 0.0030$, respectively. The $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ averaged
value of the decay parameter is extracted to be $\alpha_{\rm{avg}} = 0.7542 \pm
0.0010 \pm 0.0024$ with unprecedented accuracy. The $CP$ asymmetry
$A_{CP}=(\alpha_{-}+\alpha_{+})/(\alpha_{-}-\alpha_{+})$ is determined to be
$-0.0025 \pm 0.0046 \pm 0.0012$, which is one of the most precise measurements
in the baryon sector. The reported results for the decay parameter will play an
important role in the studies of the polarizations and $CP$ violations for the
strange, charmed and beauty baryons.

additional emission appeared in the spectrum of AR Lac at wavelengths nearby Ca
II H\&K ($\lambda $ = 3933, 3968 \AA), nearby Si IV lines ($\lambda $ = 4089,
4116 \AA). Variations in these lines range from 2 to 5\%. We have estimated the
UBV magnitudes from spectrograms through a mathematical convolution of the
spectra with the filter transmission curves. The flare amplitudes in the UBV
band up to 0.8 magnitudes were discovered. A detailed colorimetric analysis has
allowed important parameters of the flares on AR Lac to be estimated: the
temperatures at maximum light and their sizes. The color-color $(U-B)$ -
$(B-V)$ diagrams confirm that all the flares at maximum light radiate as a
blackbody. The temperatures at maximum light were up to 12000 $\pm $ 300 K.
Based on our colorimetric analysis, we have estimated the linear sizes of the
flares at maximum light. The linear size of the flares at the maximum
luminosity is approximately 2\% of the radius of the star.

is studied for the two-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)

that divides each data stream into common and private sub-streams, in which the
private stream is recovered by the dedicated receiver only while the common
stream is required to be recovered by both receivers. Specifically, to enable
IF sum decoding at the receiver side, all streams are encoded using the same
lattice code. Additionally, the number of common and private streams of each
user is carefully determined by considering the number of antennas at
transmitters and receivers, the channel matrices, and the effective
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each receiver to maximize the achievable rate.
Furthermore, we consider various assumptions of channel state information at
the transmitter side (CSIT) and propose low-complexity linear transmit
beamforming suitable for each CSIT assumption. The achievable sum rate and rate
region are analytically derived and extensively evaluated by simulation for
various environments, demonstrating that the proposed interference management
scheme strictly outperforms the previous benchmark schemes in a wide range of
channel parameters due to the gain from IF sum decoding.

that the AP is equipped with multiple antennas and the IRS is equipped with a

AP-IRS-target-IRS-AP link. Under this setup, we jointly design the transmit

obtain the CRLB expression for estimating the DoA in closed form. Next, we
optimize the joint beamforming design to minimize the CRLB, via alternating

Numerical results show that the proposed design based on CRLB minimization
achieves improved sensing performance in terms of mean squared error, as

Compared to offloading deep learning from smartphones to the cloud, on-device
deep learning enables offline model inference while preserving user privacy.
However, such mechanisms inevitably store models on users' smartphones and may
invite adversarial attacks as they are accessible to attackers. Due to the
characteristic of the on-device model, most existing adversarial attacks cannot
be directly applied for on-device models. In this paper, we introduce a
grey-box adversarial attack framework to hack on-device models by crafting
highly similar binary classification models based on identified transfer
learning approaches and pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub. We evaluate the
attack effectiveness and generality in terms of four different settings
including pre-trained models, datasets, transfer learning approaches and
adversarial attack algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed
attacks remain effective regardless of different settings, and significantly
outperform state-of-the-art baselines. We further conduct an empirical study on
real-world deep learning mobile apps collected from Google Play. Among 53 apps
adopting transfer learning, we find that 71.7\% of them can be successfully
attacked, which includes popular ones in medicine, automation, and finance

allows deletions of simplices besides insertions. However, computing zigzag
persistence usually takes considerably more time than the standard persistence.
We propose an algorithm called FastZigzag which narrows this efficiency gap.
Our main result is that an input simplex-wise zigzag filtration can be
converted to a cell-wise non-zigzag filtration of a $\Delta$-complex with the
same length, where the cells are copies of the input simplices. This conversion
step in FastZigzag incurs very little cost. Furthermore, the barcode of the
original filtration can be easily read from the barcode of the new cell-wise
filtration because the conversion embodies a series of diamond switches known
in topological data analysis. This seemingly simple observation opens up the
vast possibilities for improving the computation of zigzag persistence because
any efficient algorithm/software for standard persistence can now be applied to
computing zigzag persistence. Our experiment shows that this indeed achieves
substantial performance gain over the existing state-of-the-art softwares.

they have large fundamental band gaps and no quasi-particle excitations in the
visible range. Why such insulators possess the colors they do poses a serious
challenge for any many-body theory to reliably pick up the interactions
responsible for the color. We pick two archetypal cases as examples: NiO with
green color and MnF\textsubscript{2} with pink color. The body of literature
around the collective charge transitions (excitons) that are responsible for
the color in these and other strongly correlated systems, often fail to
disentangle two important factors: what makes them form and what makes them
optically bright. An adequate answer requires a theoretical approach able to
compute such excitations in periodic crystals, reliably and without free
parameters -- a formidable challenge. We employ two kinds of advanced \emph{ab
initio} many body Green's function theories to investigate both optical and
spin susceptibilities. The first, a perturbative theory based on low-order
extensions of the $GW$ approximation, is able to explain the color in NiO, and
indeed well describe the dielectric response over the entire frequency
spectrum, while the same theory is unable to explain why MnF\textsubscript{2}
is pink. We show its color originates from higher order spin-flip transitions
that modify the optical response. This phenomenon is not captured by low-order
perturbation theory, but it is contained in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT),
which has a dynamical spin-flip vertex that contributes to the charge
susceptibility. We show that symmetry lowering mechanisms, such as spin-orbit
coupling, odd-parity phonons and Jan-Teller distortions, determine how `bright'
these excitons are, but are not fundamental to their existence.

these putative planets accessible to the Doppler method, but the actual extent
of growth and orbital evolution remains unconstrained.
  Under the premise that the gaps in the disk around HD 163296 originate from
new-born planets, we investigate if and under which circumstances the
gap-opening planets could represent progenitors of the exoplanet population
detected around A-type stars. In particular, we study the dependence of final
planetary masses and orbital parameters on the viscosity of the disk. The
evolution of the embedded planets was simulated throughout the disk lifetime
and up to 100 Myr after the dispersal of the disk, taking the evolving disk
structure and a likely range of disk lifetimes into account.
  We find that the final configuration of the planets is largely determined by
the $\alpha$ viscosity parameter of the disk and less dependent on the choice
for the disk lifetime and the initial planetary parameters. If we assume that
planets such as those in HD 163296 evolve to form the observed exoplanet
population of A-type stars, a $\alpha$ parameter on the order of $3.16 \times
10^{-4} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$ is required for the disks to induce
sufficiently high migration rates. Depending on whether or not future direct
imaging surveys will uncover a larger number of planets with $m_\mathrm{pl}
\lesssim 3 M_\mathrm{Jup}$ and $a_\mathrm{pl} \gtrsim 10 \mathrm{AU}$ we expect
the $\alpha$ parameter to be at the lower or upper end of this range, always

strong ability of traditional image analysis techniques in capturing shape

recently proposed to exploit such prior information and achieved robust
performance. However, these two types of important prior information are
usually studied separately in existing models. In this paper, we propose a
novel DL model to model both type of priors within a single framework.
Specifically, we introduce an extra encoder into the classic encoder-decoder
structure to form a Siamese structure for the encoders, where one of them takes
a target image as input (the image-encoder), and the other concatenates a
template image and its foreground regions as input (the template-encoder). The
template-encoder encodes the shape priors and appearance characteristics of
each foreground class in the template image. A cosine similarity based
attention module is proposed to fuse the information from both encoders, to
utilize both types of prior information encoded by the template-encoder and
model the inter-subject similarity for each foreground class. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can
produce superior performance to competing methods.

two issues with cost-conscious settings and local inference. However, due to
the limited memory and computing resources, on-device recommender systems are
confronted with two fundamental challenges: (1) how to reduce the size of
regular models to fit edge devices? (2) how to retain the original capacity?
Previous research mostly adopts tensor decomposition techniques to compress the
regular recommendation model with limited compression ratio so as to avoid
drastic performance degradation. In this paper, we explore ultra-compact models
for next-item recommendation, by loosing the constraint of dimensionality
consistency in tensor decomposition. Meanwhile, to compensate for the capacity
loss caused by compression, we develop a self-supervised knowledge distillation
framework which enables the compressed model (student) to distill the essential

recommendation through an embedding-recombination strategy with the original

specifically, confront the model with the observational data of SN 2006aj/GRB
060218. SN 2006aj is featured by its remarkable double-peaked
ultraviolet-optical (UV-opt) light curves. By fitting these light curves, we
demonstrate that the first peak can be well accounted for by the breakout
emission of the shock driven by the magnetar wind, while the primary supernova
emission is also partly powered by the energy injection from the magnetar. The
magnetic field strength of the magnetar is constrained to be $\sim 10^{15}$ G,
which is in good agreement with the common results inferred from the afterglow
emission of long GRBs. In more detail, it is further suggested that the UV
excess in the late emission of the supernova could also be due to the leakage
of the non-thermal emission of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN), if some special
conditions can be satisfied. The consistency between the model and the SN

ubiquitous in the GRB phenomena and even further intensify their connection

for communications and sensing. Non-magnetic mechanisms of optical
nonreciprocity are highly desired for high-frequency on-chip applications.
Here, we investigate the nonreciprocal properties of light propagation in a
dielectric waveguide induced by a subwavelength spinning cylinder. We find that
the chiral modes of the cylinder can give rise to unidirectional coupling with
the waveguide via the transverse spin-orbit interaction, leading to different
transmissions for guided wave propagating in opposite directions and thus
optical isolation. We reveal the dependence of the nonreciprocal properties on
various system parameters including mode order, spinning speed, and coupling
distance. The results show that higher-order chiral modes and larger spinning
speed generally give rise to stronger nonreciprocity, and there exists an
optimal cylinder-waveguide coupling distance where the optical isolation
reaches the maximum. Our work contributes to the understanding of
nonreciprocity in subwavelength moving structures and can find applications in
integrated photonic circuits, topological photonics, and novel metasurfaces.

  It turns out that BH spacetimes with spins $a/M= \sqrt {8/9}$ and
$a/M=1/\sqrt{2}$ show anomalies in the rotational energy extraction and surface
gravity whereas the case $a/M=\sqrt{3}/2$ is of particular relevance to study
the variations of the horizon area. We find the general conditions under which
BH transitions can occur and express them in terms of the masses of the initial

near the BH poles it is possible to detect photon orbits with frequencies that

lack biological plausibility or fall short of behavioral flexibility when

achieves behavioral flexibility with better biological plausibility. We first
train a mixture of Gaussian distributions to model the ensemble of firing
fields of place cells. Then we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the
synaptic strength matrix among place cells. This matrix is interpreted as the
transition rate matrix of a continuous time Markov chain to generate the
sequential replay of place cells. During replay, the synaptic strengths from
place cells to medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a temporal-difference
like rule to store place-reward associations. After replay, the activation of
MSN will ramp up when an animal approaches the rewarding place, so the animal
can move along the direction where the MSN activation is increasing to find the
rewarding place. We implement our theory into a high-fidelity virtual rat in
the MuJoCo physics simulator. In a complex maze, the rat shows significantly
better learning efficiency and behavioral flexibility than a rat that

predictive maintenance for mechanical condition monitoring. In real industrial
systems, the main challenges for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings
pertain to the accuracy and real-time requirements. Most existing methods focus
on ensuring the accuracy, and the real-time requirement is often neglected. In
this paper, considering both requirements, we propose a novel fast fault
diagnosis method for rolling bearings, based on extreme learning machine (ELM)
and logistic mapping, named logistic-ELM. First, we identify 14 kinds of
time-domain features from the original vibration signals according to
mechanical vibration principles and adopt the sequential forward selection
(SFS) strategy to select optimal features from them to ensure the basic
predictive accuracy and efficiency. Next, we propose the logistic-ELM for fast
fault classification, where the biases in ELM are omitted and the random input
weights are replaced by the chaotic logistic mapping sequence which involves a
higher uncorrelation to obtain more accurate results with fewer hidden neurons.
We conduct extensive experiments on the rolling bearing vibration signal
dataset of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Centre. The
experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing SOTA
comparison methods in terms of the predictive accuracy, and the highest
accuracy is 100% in seven separate sub data environments. The relevant code is
publicly available at https://github.com/TAN-OpenLab/logistic-ELM.

a similarity metric in this space via bi-directional contrastive loss between
projected graph and image embeddings. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach on three benchmark datasets.We also demonstrate via an image retrieval

  https://github.com/deepmind/emergent_in_context_learning",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Large transformer-based models are able to perform in-context few-shot
learning, without being explicitly trained for it. This observation raises the
question: what aspects of the training regime lead to this emergent behavior?
Here, we show that this behavior is driven by the distributions of the training
data itself. In-context learning emerges when the training data exhibits
particular distributional properties such as burstiness (items appear in
clusters rather than being uniformly distributed over time) and having large
numbers of rarely occurring classes. In-context learning also emerges more
strongly when item meanings or interpretations are dynamic rather than fixed.
These properties are exemplified by natural language, but are also inherent to
naturalistic data in a wide range of other domains. They also depart
significantly from the uniform, i.i.d. training distributions typically used
for standard supervised learning. In our initial experiments, we found that
in-context learning traded off against more conventional weight-based learning,
and models were unable to achieve both simultaneously. However, our later
experiments uncovered that the two modes of learning could co-exist in a single
model when it was trained on data following a skewed Zipfian distribution --
another common property of naturalistic data, including language. In further
experiments, we found that naturalistic data distributions were only able to
elicit in-context learning in transformers, and not in recurrent models. In
sum, our findings indicate how the transformer architecture works together with
particular properties of the training data to drive the intriguing emergent
in-context learning behaviour of large language models, and how future work
might encourage both in-context and in-weights learning in domains beyond
language.
