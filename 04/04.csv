has been increasing interest in document-level relation extraction (DocRE).
DocRE requires integrating information within and across sentences, capturing
complex interactions between mentions of entities. Most existing methods are
pipeline-based, requiring entities as input. However, jointly learning to
extract entities and relations can improve performance and be more efficient
due to shared parameters and training steps. In this paper, we develop a
sequence-to-sequence approach, seq2rel, that can learn the subtasks of DocRE
(entity extraction, coreference resolution and relation extraction) end-to-end,
replacing a pipeline of task-specific components. Using a simple strategy we
call entity hinting, we compare our approach to existing pipeline-based methods
on several popular biomedical datasets, in some cases exceeding their
performance. We also report the first end-to-end results on these datasets for
future comparison. Finally, we demonstrate that, under our model, an end-to-end
approach outperforms a pipeline-based approach. Our code, data and trained
models are available at {\url{https://github.com/johngiorgi/seq2rel}}. An

been thoroughly explored. While previous work has shown that
adversarially-trained image classifiers can be used to perform image synthesis,
we have yet to understand how best to leverage an adversarially-trained

that adversarially-trained semantic segmentation networks can be used to
perform image inpainting and generation. Our experiments demonstrate that
adversarially-trained segmentation networks are more robust and indeed exhibit
perceptually-aligned gradients which help in producing plausible image
inpaintings. We seek to place additional weight behind the hypothesis that
adversarially robust models exhibit gradients that are more
perceptually-aligned with human vision. Through image synthesis, we argue that
perceptually-aligned gradients promote a better understanding of a neural
network's learned representations and aid in making neural networks more
interpretable.

the dynamics and complexity of cities. Despite growing research on analysis of
lifestyle patterns in cities, little is known about the characteristics of
people's lifestyles patterns at urban scale. This limitation is primarily due
to challenges in characterizing lifestyle patterns when human movement data is
aggregated to protect the privacy of users. In this study, we model cities
based on aggregated human visitation data to construct a network of places. We
then examine the subgraph signatures in the networks of places to map and
characterize lifestyle patterns at city scale. Location-based data from Harris
County, Dallas County, New York County, and Broward County in the United States
were examined to reveal lifestyle signatures in cities. For the motif analysis,
two-node, three-node, and four-node motifs without location attributes were
extracted from human visitation networks. Second, homogenized nodes in motifs
were encoded with location categories from NAICS codes. Multiple statistical
measures, including network metrics and motif properties, were quantified to
characterize lifestyle signatures. The results show that: people's lifestyles
in urban environments can be well depicted and quantified based on distribution
and attributes of motifs in networks of places; motifs in networks of places
show stability in quantity and distance as well as periodicity on weekends and
weekdays indicating the stability of lifestyle patterns in cities; human
visitation networks and lifestyle patterns show similarities across different
metropolitan areas implying the universality of lifestyle signatures across
cities. The findings provide deeper insights into urban lifestyles signatures
in urban studies and provide important insights for data-informed urban
planning and management.

consistent with direct observations of its nucleus. The reflectance spectrum of
BA$_{14}$ is similar to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, albeit highly

longer wavelengths, which we correct with a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo

is $p_V=0.01-0.03$, consistent with radar observations, its beaming parameter
is typical for NEOs observed in its geometry, and its reflectrance spectrum is

the object's activity diminished might help to reconcile some of the lines of

on these reformulated constraints, we design a distributionally robust and
robustly stable benchmark SMPC algorithm for the ideal setting of known noise
statistics. Then, we employ this benchmark controller to derive a novel
robustly stable adaptive SMPC scheme that learns the necessary noise statistics
online, while guaranteeing time-uniform satisfaction of the unknown
reformulated state constraints with high probability. The latter is achieved
through the use of confidence intervals which rely on the empirical noise
statistics and are valid uniformly over time. Moreover, control performance is
improved over time as more noise samples are gathered and better estimates of
the noise statistics are obtained, given the online adaptation of the estimated
reformulated constraints. Additionally, in tracking problems with multiple
successive targets our approach leads to an online-enlarged domain of
attraction compared to robust tube-based MPC. A numerical simulation of a DC-DC

of animals which shows that the misclassification of some animal breeds is
largely a data issue. We then create procedural images of the poorly classified
breeds and that model further trained on procedural data can better classify
poorly performing breeds on real data. We believe that this approach can be
used for the enhancement of visual data for any underrepresented group,
including rare diseases, or any data bias potentially improving the accuracy
and fairness of models. We find that the resulting representations rival or
even out-perform those learned directly from real data, but that good
performance requires care in the 3D rendered procedural data generation. 3D

proliferate while datasets become increasingly unwieldy, missing, or private.

mapping from the ambient space to the desired submanifold is implemented as a
composition of an encoder that maps each point to a tuple of (positive or
negative) times and a decoder given by a composition of flows along finitely
many vector fields starting from a fixed initial point. The encoder supplies
the times for the flows. The encoder-decoder map is obtained by empirical risk
minimization, and a high-probability bound is given on the excess risk relative
to the minimum expected reconstruction error over a given class of
encoder-decoder maps. The proposed approach makes fundamental use of Sussmann's
orbit theorem, which guarantees that the image of the reconstruction map is
indeed contained in an immersed submanifold.

  Location","33 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work we introduce an alternative model for the design and analysis of
strategyproof mechanisms that is motivated by the recent surge of work in
""learning-augmented algorithms"". Aiming to complement the traditional approach
in computer science, which analyzes the performance of algorithms based on
worst-case instances, this line of work has focused on the design and analysis
of algorithms that are enhanced with machine-learned predictions regarding the
optimal solution. The algorithms can use the predictions as a guide to inform
their decisions, and the goal is to achieve much stronger performance
guarantees when these predictions are accurate (consistency), while also
maintaining near-optimal worst-case guarantees, even if these predictions are
very inaccurate (robustness). So far, these results have been limited to
algorithms, but in this work we argue that another fertile ground for this
framework is in mechanism design.
  We initiate the design and analysis of strategyproof mechanisms that are
augmented with predictions regarding the private information of the
participating agents. To exhibit the important benefits of this approach, we
revisit the canonical problem of facility location with strategic agents in the
two-dimensional Euclidean space. We study both the egalitarian and utilitarian
social cost functions, and we propose new strategyproof mechanisms that
leverage predictions to guarantee an optimal trade-off between consistency and
robustness guarantees. This provides the designer with a menu of mechanism
options to choose from, depending on her confidence regarding the prediction
accuracy. Furthermore, we also prove parameterized approximation results as a
function of the prediction error, showing that our mechanisms perform well even
when the predictions are not fully accurate.

cm fluctuations are among the most direct statistical probes of the
non-Gaussian nature of structure formation and evolution during reionization.
However, contamination from astrophysical foregrounds and instrument
systematics pose significant challenges in measuring these statistics in real
observations. In this work, we use forward modelling to investigate the
feasibility of measuring 21 cm one-point statistics through a foreground
avoidance strategy. Leveraging the characteristic wedge-shape of the
foregrounds in k-space, we apply a wedge-cut filter that removes the foreground
contaminated modes from a mock data set based on the Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array (HERA) instrument, and measure the one-point statistics from
the image-space representation of the remaining non-contaminated modes. We
experiment with varying degrees of wedge-cutting over different frequency
bandwidths and find that the centre of the band is the least susceptible to
bias from wedge-cutting. Based on this finding, we introduce a rolling filter
method that allows reconstruction of an optimal wedge-cut 21~cm intensity map
over the full bandwidth using outputs from wedge-cutting over multiple
sub-bands. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to show that HERA should be able
to measure the rise in skewness and kurtosis near the end of reionization with
the rolling wedge-cut method if foreground leakage from the Fourier transform
window function can be controlled.

that each element generates a finite-dimensional subalgebra. Every Bernstein
algebra has a maximal algebraic ideal, and the quotient algebra is a
zero-multiplication algebra. Several equivalent conditions for a Bernstein
algebra to be algebraic are given. In particular, known characterizations of
train Bernstein algebras in terms of nilpotency are generalized to the case of
locally train algebras. Along the way, we show that if a Banach Bernstein
algebra is algebraic (respectively, locally train), then it is of bounded
degree (respectively, train).
  Then we investigate the Kurosh problem for Bernstein algebras: whether a
finitely generated Bernstein algebra which is algebraic of bounded degree is
finite-dimensional. This problem turns out to have a closed link with a
question about associative algebras. In particular, when the barideal is nil,
the Kurosh problem asks whether a finitely generated Bernstein-train algebra is
finite-dimensional. We prove that the answer is positive for some specific
cases and for low degrees, and construct counter-examples in the general case.

We evaluate modulus decay to Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)

tightening error bars on \Delta N_{eff}, we find only mild constraints on
modulus-ALP couplings due to the somewhat suppressed modulus branching fraction
to DR owing to the large number of MSSM decay modes. We anticipate that future
CMB experiments with greater precision on \Delta N_{eff} may still turn up
evidence for DR if the ALP associated with the lightest modulus field is indeed

degraded numerical accuracy of well-known shock-resolving WENO (weighted
essentially non-oscillatory) schemes when used with relaxed synchronization is

the planet atmosphere. METHODS: The full light curves acquired by the TESS
satellite from two sectors are used to put upper limit on the amplitude of the
planet's phase variation and estimate the occultation depth. Two, already
published and one, yet unpublished followup observations in the 2MASS K (Ks)
band are employed to derive a more precise occultation light curve in this near
infrared waveband. RESULTS: The merged occultation light curve in the Ks band
comprises 4515 data points. The data confirm the results of the earlier
eccentricity estimates, suggesting circular orbit: e=0.005+/-0.015. The high
value of the flux depression of (2.70+/-0.14) ppt in the Ks band excludes
simple black body emission at the 10 sigma level and disagrees also with
current atmospheric models at the (4-7) sigma level. From the analysis of the
TESS data, in the visual band we found tentative evidence for a near noise
level detection of the secondary eclipse, and placed constraints on the
associated amplitude of the planet's phase variation. A formal box fit yields
an occultation depth of (0.157+/-0.056) ppt. This implies a relatively high
geometric albedo of Ag=0.43+/-0.15 for fully efficient atmospheric circulation
and Ag=0.29+/-0.15 for no circulation at all. No preference can be seen either

theory, Ruppeiner gave it a Riemannian geometric structure with an entropic
metric. This yielded a fundamental quantity - the Riemannian curvature, which
was used to extract information on the nature of interactions between molecules
in fluids, ideal gases and other open systems. In this article, we examine the
implications of this curvature in a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system where
relaxation is sufficiently slow so as not to invalidate the local equilibrium
hypothesis. The non-equilibrium system comprises of a rubbery polymer
undergoing strain induced crystallization. The curvature is found to impart
information on a spurious isochoric energy arising from the conformational
stretching of already crystallized segments. This unphysical component perhaps
arises as the crystallized manifold is considered Euclidean with the stretch
measures defined via the Euclidean metric. The thermodynamic state associated
with curvature is the key to determine the isochoric stretch and hence the
spurious energy. We determine this stretch and propose a form for the spurious
free energy that must be removed from the total energy in order that the
correct stresses are recovered.

by monitoring the evolution of the wave-vector resolved ultrafast electron
diffraction intensity following above-bandgap photo-excitation, we obtain a
direct visual of the structural dynamics in monocrystalline 2D perovskites.
Analysis reveals a surprising, light-induced ultrafast lattice ordering
resulting from a strong interaction between hot-carriers and the perovskite
lattice, which induces an in-plane octahedra rotation, towards a more symmetric
phase. Correlated ultrafast spectroscopy performed at the same carrier density
as ultrafast electron diffraction reveals that the creation of a hot and dense

modulating the crystal cohesive energy. Finally, we show that the interaction
between the carrier gas and the lattice can be altered by tailoring the
rigidity of the 2D perovskite by choosing the appropriate organic spacer layer.

packages to produce inference, e.g., the coxph function in R and the PHREG
procedure in SAS. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the
MPLE in the regime in which the number of parameters p is of the same order as
the number of samples n. The main results are (i) existence of the MPLE
undergoes a sharp 'phase transition'; (ii) the classical MPLE theory leads to
invalid inference in the high-dimensional regime. We show that the asymptotic
behavior of the MPLE is governed by a new asymptotic theory. These findings are
further corroborated through numerical studies. The main technical tool in our
proofs is the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), which has not been
previously used in the analysis of partial likelihood. Our results thus extend
the scope of CGMT and shed new light on the use of CGMT for examining the
existence of MPLE and non-separable objective functions.

in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, using a multistage event generator within
the JETSCAPE framework. We focus on medium-induced modifications in the rate of
inclusive jets and high transverse momentum (high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$) hadrons.
Scattering-induced jet energy loss is calculated in two stages: A high
virtuality stage based on the MATTER model, in which scattering of highly
virtual partons modifies the vacuum radiation pattern, and a second stage at
lower jet virtuality based on the LBT model, in which leading partons gain and
lose virtuality by scattering and radiation. Coherence effects that reduce the
medium-induced emission rate in the MATTER phase are also included. The TRENTo
model is used for initial conditions, and the (2+1)dimensional VISHNU model is
used for viscous hydrodynamic evolution. Jet interactions with the medium are
modeled via 2-to-2 scattering with Debye screened potentials, in which the
recoiling partons are tracked, hadronized, and included in the jet clustering.
Holes left in the medium are also tracked and subtracted to conserve transverse
momentum. Calculations of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\mathrm{AA}}$)
for inclusive jets and high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hadrons are compared to
experimental measurements at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Within this framework, we find that with
one extra parameter which codifies the transition between stages of jet
modification -- along with the typical parameters such as the coupling in the
medium, the start and stop criteria etc. -- we can describe these data at all
energies for central and semicentral collisions without a rescaling of the jet
transport coefficient $\hat{q}$.

indoor space design can significantly influence occupant well-being. Adequate
views to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to
occupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends,
designers may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside
with an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants.
To better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design
feedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to
capture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research
remains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use
early-design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be
advantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation,
plan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper,
hence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with
590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to
predict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an
existing view assessment framework through case studies. The result showed that
the new prediction is more accurate to the surveyed result than the framework.
Further, the prediction performance was generally high for most responses,
verifying the reliability. To facilitate view analysis in early design, this
paper describes integrating the satisfaction prediction model and a ray-casting
tool to compute view parameters in the CAD environment.

produce quasirealistic N = 1 supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model in
the low-energy limit. We start rather generally by deriving the
four-dimensional spectrum and Lagrangian terms from the ten-dimensional theory,
through a process of compactification over six-dimensional Calabi-Yau
manifolds, upon which holomorphic poly-stable vector bundles are defined. We
then specialise to a class of heterotic string models for which the vector
bundle is split into a sum of line bundles and the Calabi-Yau manifold is
defined as a complete intersection in projective ambient spaces. We develop a
method for calculating holomorphic Yukawa couplings for such models, by
relating bundle-valued forms on the Calabi-Yau manifold to their ambient space
counterparts, so that the relevant integrals can be evaluated over projective
spaces. The method is applicable for any of the 7890 CICY manifolds known in
the literature, and we show that it can be related to earlier algebraic
techniques to compute holomorphic Yukawa couplings. We provide explicit
calculations of the holomorphic Yukawa couplings for models compactified on the
tetra-quadric and on a co-dimension two CICY. A vanishing theorem is
formulated, showing that in some cases, topology rather than symmetry is
responsible for the absence of certain trilinear couplings. In addition, some
Yukawa matrices are found to be dependent on the complex structure moduli and
their rank is reduced in certain regions of the moduli space. In the final
part, we focus on a method to evaluate the matter field Kahler potential
without knowing the Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau metric. This is possible for large
internal gauge fluxes, for which the normalisation integral localises around a
point on the compactification manifold.

handcrafted verbalizers, we learn new multi-token label embeddings during
fine-tuning, which are not tied to the model vocabulary and which allow us to
avoid complex auto-regressive decoding. These embeddings are not only learnable

deposit onto a reactive cluster, the cluster undergoes a transition from a
compact to a dendritic morphology. Continuum modeling reveals that the critical
radius for this compact-to-dendritic (CTD) transition should be proportional to
the particle diffusivity divided by the surface reaction rate. However,
previous studies have had limited success verifying that the same scaling
arises in the continuum limit of a particle-based deposition model. This
discrepancy suggests that the continuum model may be missing part of the
microscopic dendrite formation mechanism, a concerning hypothesis given that
similar models are commonly used to study dendritic growth in electrodeposition
and lithium metal batteries. To clarify the accuracy of such models, we
reexamine the particle-based CTD transition using larger system sizes, up to
hundreds of millions of particles in some cases, and an improved paradigm for
the surface reaction. Specifically, this paradigm allows us to converge our
simulations and to work in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. With
these methods, we show that in both two and three dimensions, the behavior of
the critical radius is consistent with the scaling of the continuum model. Our
results help unify the particle-based and continuum views of the CTD
transition. In each of these cases, dendrites emerge when particles can no
longer diffuse around the cluster within the characteristic reaction timescale.
Consequently, this work implies that continuum methods can effectively capture
the microscopic physics of dendritic deposition.

with a 'product picture'. It aims to complement the longer exposition in a
recent paper in 'Foundations of Physics' and to help to make that work more
accessible. The product picture is a formulation of QED, equivalent to standard
Coulomb gauge QED, but in which the Hilbert space arises as (a certain physical
subspace of) a product of a Hilbert space for the electromagnetic field and a
Hilbert space for charged matter (i.e. the Dirac field) and in which the
Hamiltonian arises as the sum of an electromagnetic Hamiltonian and a charged
matter Hamiltonian and an interaction term. (The Coulomb gauge formulation of
QED is not a product picture because, in it, the longitudinal part of the
electromagnetic field is made out of charged matter operators.) We also recall
a 'Contradictory Commutator Theorem' for QED which exposes flaws in previous
attempts at temporal gauge quantization of QED and we explain how our product
picture appears to offer a way to overcome those flaws. Additionally, we
discuss the extent to which that theorem generalizes to Yang-Mills fields. We
also develop a product picture for nonrelativistic charged particles in
interaction with the electromagnetic field and point out how this leads to a
novel way of thinking about the theory of many nonrelativistic electrically
charged particles with Coulomb interactions. We explain how the provision of a
product picture for QED gives hope that one will be able likewise to have a
product picture for (Yang Mills and) quantum gravity -- the latter being needed
to make sense of the author's 'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis'. In an
afterword, we briefly discuss similarities and differences between that
hypothesis and its predictions and ideas of Roger Penrose related to a possible
role of gravity in quantum state reduction and to cosmological entropy.

backreaction from the charged particles on the gauge fields, we develop a
procedure to obtain an equilibrium solution for the gauge fields by treating
the induced current as effective electric and magnetic conductivities.
Introducing mean field approximation, and numerically solving self-consistency
equations, we find that the gauge field amplitudes are drastically suppressed.
Interestingly, as the production becomes more efficient, the charged particles
gain a larger part of the transferred energy from the inflaton and eventually
dominate it. Our formalism offers a basis to connect this class of inflationary
models to a rich phenomenology such as baryogenesis and magnetogenesis.

challenging. Previous approaches to integration had to compromise between
various adverse effects on the strength of light-matter interactions in the

polymethyl methacrylate/silicon oxide (PMMA/SiO$_x$) as a cavity spacer.
Because the exciton oscillator strength is well protected against the required

theoretical constructs, such as the information gap theory and compression
progress theory, have sought to explain how we engage in its practice.
According to the former, curiosity is the drive to acquire information that is
missing from our understanding of the world. According to the latter, curiosity
is the drive to construct an increasingly parsimonious mental model of the
world. To complement the densification processes inherent to these theories, we
propose the conformational change theory, wherein we posit that curiosity
results in mental models with marked conceptual flexibility. We formalize
curiosity as the process of building a growing knowledge network to
quantitatively investigate information gap theory, compression progress theory,
and the conformational change theory of curiosity. In knowledge networks, gaps
can be identified as topological cavities, compression progress can be
quantified using network compressibility, and flexibility can be measured as
the number of conformational degrees of freedom. We leverage data acquired from
the online encyclopedia Wikipedia to determine the degree to which each theory
explains the growth of knowledge networks built by individuals and by
collectives. Our findings lend support to a pluralistic view of curiosity,
wherein intrinsically motivated information acquisition fills knowledge gaps
and simultaneously leads to increasingly compressible and flexible knowledge
networks. Across individuals and collectives, we determine the contexts in
which each theoretical account may be explanatory, thereby clarifying their
complementary and distinct explanations of curiosity. Our findings offer a
novel network theoretical perspective on intrinsically motivated information
acquisition that may harmonize with or compel an expansion of the traditional

measures that have realizations as vectors. When comparing two probability
measures over images, practitioners first need to vectorize images and then
project them to one-dimensional space by using matrix multiplication between
the sample matrix and the projection matrix. After that, the sliced Wasserstein
is evaluated by averaging the two corresponding one-dimensional projected
probability measures. However, this approach has two limitations. The first
limitation is that the spatial structure of images is not captured efficiently
by the vectorization step; therefore, the later slicing process becomes harder
to gather the discrepancy information. The second limitation is memory
inefficiency since each slicing direction is a vector that has the same
dimension as the images. To address these limitations, we propose novel slicing
methods for sliced Wasserstein between probability measures over images that
are based on the convolution operators. We derive convolution sliced
Wasserstein (CSW) and its variants via incorporating stride, dilation, and
non-linear activation function into the convolution operators. We investigate
the metricity of CSW as well as its sample complexity, its computational
complexity, and its connection to conventional sliced Wasserstein distances.
Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of CSW over the conventional
sliced Wasserstein in comparing probability measures over images and in
training deep generative modeling on images.

anisotropy is that the ratio of galaxy spin directions is a relative
measurement, and therefore less sensitive to background contamination such as
Milky Way obstruction. Another advantage is that many spiral galaxies have
spectra, and therefore allow to analyze the location of such axis relative to
Earth. This paper shows an analysis of the distribution of the spin directions
of over 90K galaxies with spectra. That analysis is also compared to previous

machine learning methods have many advantages for IDS, previous models usually

costs. To handle this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised
learning-based convolutional adversarial autoencoder model in this paper. The
proposed model combines two popular deep learning models: autoencoder and
generative adversarial networks. First, the model is trained with unlabeled

disproportionately reside in rural and remote areas, minority students were
among those at elevated risk of experiencing school consolidation. We analyze
heterogeneous effects of consolidation on educational attainment and reported
national language ability in China by exploiting variations in closure timing
across villages and cohorts captured in a 2011 survey of provinces and
autonomous regions with substantial minority populations. We consider
heterogeneous treatment effects across groups defined at the intersections of
minority status, gender, and community ethnic composition and socioeconomic
status. Compared to villages with schools, villages whose schools had closed
reported that the schools students now attended were better resourced, less
likely to offer minority language of instruction, more likely to have Han
teachers, farther away, and more likely to require boarding. Much more than Han
youth, ethnic minority youth were negatively affected by closure, in terms of
its impact on both educational attainment and written Mandarin facility.
However, significant penalties accruing to minority youth occurred only in the
poorest villages. Penalties were generally heavier for girls, but in the most
ethnically segregated minority villages, boys from minority families were
highly vulnerable to closure effects on attainment and written Mandarin

based on image reconstruction loss using only unlabeled single temporal single
image. The image reconstruction model is trained to reconstruct the original
source image by receiving the source image and the photometrically transformed
source image as a pair. During inference, the model receives bi-temporal images
as the input, and tries to reconstruct one of the inputs. The changed region
between bi-temporal images shows high reconstruction loss. Our change detector
showed significant performance in various change detection benchmark datasets
even though only a single temporal single source image was used. The code and

the utmost precision to segment for a successful surgery. Patients with tumors
usually take 4 MRI scans, T1, T1gd, T2, and FLAIR, which are then sent to
radiologists to segment and analyze for possible future surgery. To create a
second segmentation, it would be beneficial to both radiologists and patients
in being more confident in their conclusions. We propose using a method
performed by radiologists called image segmentation and applying it to machine
learning models to prove a better segmentation. Using Mask R-CNN, its ResNet
backbone being pre-trained on the RSNA pneumonia detection challenge dataset,
we can train a model on the Brats2020 Brain Tumor dataset. Center for
Biomedical Image Computing & Analytics provides MRI data on patients with and
without brain tumors and the corresponding segmentations. We can see how well
the method of image subtraction works by comparing it to models without image
subtraction through DICE coefficient (F1 score), recall, and precision on the
untouched test set. Our model performed with a DICE coefficient of 0.75 in
comparison to 0.69 without image subtraction. To further emphasize the
usefulness of image subtraction, we compare our final model to current

effect of attributes is under-explored. To better transfer attribute-based
knowledge from seen to unseen classes, we argue that an image representation
with integrated attribute localization ability would be beneficial for
any-shot, i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, image classification tasks. To this end,
we propose a novel representation learning framework that jointly learns
discriminative global and local features using only class-level attributes.
While a visual-semantic embedding layer learns global features, local features
are learned through an attribute prototype network that simultaneously
regresses and decorrelates attributes from intermediate features. Furthermore,
we introduce a zoom-in module that localizes and crops the informative regions
to encourage the network to learn informative features explicitly. We show that
our locality augmented image representations achieve a new state-of-the-art on
challenging benchmarks, i.e. CUB, AWA2, and SUN. As an additional benefit, our
model points to the visual evidence of the attributes in an image, confirming
the improved attribute localization ability of our image representation. The
attribute localization is evaluated quantitatively with ground truth part

on a source domain for improving its performance on a target domain. To resolve
the issue, Unsupervised Domain Expansion (UDE) has been proposed recently to
adapt the model for the target domain as UDA does, and in the meantime maintain
its performance on the source domain. For both UDA and UDE, a model tailored to
a given domain, let it be the source or the target domain, is assumed to well
handle samples from the given domain. We question the assumption by reporting
the existence of cross-domain visual ambiguity: Due to the lack of a crystally
clear boundary between the two domains, samples from one domain can be visually
close to the other domain. We exploit this finding and accordingly propose in
this paper Co-Teaching (CT) that consists of knowledge distillation based CT
(kdCT) and mixup based CT (miCT). Specifically, kdCT transfers knowledge from a
leader-teacher network and an assistant-teacher network to a student network,
so the cross-domain visual ambiguity will be better handled by the student.
Meanwhile, miCT further enhances the generalization ability of the student.
Comprehensive experiments on two image-classification benchmarks and two

particularly significant for model estimation, during which the parameters are
updated every iteration and may violate the feasibility condition of the value
function. To solve this numerical issue of the value function in the model
estimation, this study performs an extensive analysis of a prism-constrained RL
(Prism-RL) model proposed by Oyama and Hato (2019), which has a path set
constrained by the prism defined based upon a state-extended network
representation. The numerical experiments have shown two important properties
of the Prism-RL model for parameter estimation. First, the prism-based approach
enables estimation regardless of the initial and true parameter values, even in
cases where the original RL model cannot be estimated due to the numerical
problem. We also successfully captured a positive effect of the presence of
street green on pedestrian route choice in a real application. Second, the
Prism-RL model achieved better fit and prediction performance than the RL
model, by implicitly restricting paths with large detour or many loops.
Defining the prism-based path set in a data-oriented manner, we demonstrated
the possibility of the Prism-RL model describing more realistic route choice
behavior. The capture of positive network attributes while retaining the
diversity of path alternatives is important in many applications such as
pedestrian route choice and sequential destination choice behavior, and thus
the prism-based approach significantly extends the practical applicability of
the RL model.

user-controlled model for unseen poses remains a challenging task. To tackle
this problem, we introduce an effective method to a) integrate observations
across several frames and b) encode the appearance at each individual frame. We
accomplish this by utilizing both the human pose that models the body shape as
well as point clouds that partially cover the human as input. Our approach
simultaneously learns a shared set of latent codes anchored to the human pose
among several frames, and an appearance-dependent code anchored to incomplete
point clouds generated by each frame and its predicted depth. The former human
pose-based code models the shape of the performer whereas the latter point
cloud-based code predicts fine-level details and reasons about missing
structures at the unseen poses. To further recover non-visible regions in query
frames, we employ a temporal transformer to integrate features of points in
query frames and tracked body points from automatically-selected key frames.
Experiments on various sequences of dynamic humans from different datasets

  gaps","16 pages,5 figures",,"10.1007/JHEP05(2022)112",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been shown that the vacuum state of a free quantum field is entangled
and such vacuum entanglement can be harvested by a pair of initially
uncorrelated detectors interacting locally with the vacuum field for a finite
time. In this paper, we examine the entanglement harvesting phenomenon of two
non-identical inertial detectors with different energy gaps locally interacting
with massless scalar fields via a Gaussian switching function. We focus on how
entanglement harvesting depends on the energy gap difference from two
perspectives: the amount of entanglement harvested and the
harvesting-achievable separation between the two detectors. In the sense of the
amount of entanglement, we find that as long as the inter-detector separation
is not too small with respect to the interaction duration parameter, two
non-identical detectors could extract more entanglement from the vacuum state
than the identical detectors. There exists an optimal value of the energy gap
difference when the inter-detector separation is sufficiently large that
renders the harvested entanglement to peak. Regarding the harvesting-achievable
separation, we further find that the presence of an energy gap difference
generally enlarges the harvesting-achievable separation range. Our results
suggest that the non-identical detectors may be advantageous to extracting
entanglement from vacuum in certain circumstances as compared to identical
detectors.

both read and read-modify-write (RMW) operations in message-passing systems
with process crashes. Since in many systems read operations vastly outnumber
RMW operations, we are interested in implementations that emphasize the
efficiency of read operations.
  We present a parametrized algorithm for partially synchronous systems where
processes have access to external clocks that are synchronized within
$\epsilon$. With this algorithm, every read operation is local (intuitively, it
does not trigger messages). If a read is not concurrent with a conflicting RMW,
it is performed immediately with no waiting; furthermore, even with a
concurrent conflicting RMW, a read experiences very little delay in the
worst-case. For example, the algorithm's parameters can be set to ensure that
every read takes $\epsilon$ time in the worst-case. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first algorithm to achieve this bound in the partially
synchronous systems that we assume here. Our parametrized algorithm generalizes
the (non-parameterized) lease-based algorithm of Chandra et al. [6] where the
worst-case time for reads is $3\delta$, where $\delta$ is the maximum message
delay.
  The algorithm's parameters can be used to trade-off the worst-case times for
read and RMW operations. They can also be used to take advantage of the fact
that in many message-passing systems the delay of most messages is order of
magnitudes smaller than the maximum message delay~$\delta$: for example, the
parameters can be set so that, in ""nice"" periods where message delays are
$\delta^* \ll \delta$, reads take at most $\epsilon$ time while RMWs take at
most $3 \delta^*$ time.

important factor that can prevent us from achieving a high extinction ratio
MZI. By introducing a bend-based TM filter without additional loss, we
experimentally demonstrate that such a TM filter can improve the maximum
extinction ratio of the MMI-MZI by more than 10 dB. With the TM filter, we
report a record high 61.2 dB extinction ratio in a single stage, thermally
tunable MMI-MZI with only 1.5 dB insertion loss and more than 60nm bandwidth.
These results pave the way for many interesting applications.

solution to collect recent SMS spam data, at a large scale, from Twitter, where
users voluntarily report the spam messages they receive. For this purpose, we
designed and implemented SpamHunter, an automated pipeline to discover SMS spam
reporting tweets and extract message content from the attached screenshots.
Leveraging SpamHunter, we collected from Twitter a dataset of 21,918 SMS spam
messages in 75 languages, spanning over four years. To our best knowledge, this
is the largest SMS spam dataset ever made public. More importantly, SpamHunter
enables us to continuously monitor emerging SMS spam messages, which

the selection of {\Delta} greatly affects the training results, previous works
estimate {\Delta} via an approximation or treat it as a hyper-parameter, which
is suboptimal. In this paper, we present the Soft Threshold Ternary Networks

intervals instead of depending on a hard threshold. Concretely, we replace the
original ternary kernel with the addition of two binary kernels at training
time, where ternary values are determined by the combination of two
corresponding binary values. At inference time, we add up the two binary
kernels to obtain a single ternary kernel. Our method dramatically outperforms
current state-of-the-arts, lowering the performance gap between full-precision

We find two successive phase transitions at Tc1=190 K and Tc2=125 K. The first
transition at Tc1 is characterized by an order-disorder transition of the guest
molecules DMSO along with ferroelectricity. At the second transition of Tc2,
the crystal structure deforms from tetragonal to monoclinic, leading to domain
formation. Low-temperature x-ray diffraction suggests that the space group
changes from P4_12_12 (P4_32_12) to P4_1 (P4_3) at Tc1, and down to P112_1 at

semantic segmentation, which end-to-end train a set of queries representing the
class prototypes or target segments. Recently, masked attention is proposed to
restrict each query to only attend to the foreground regions predicted by the
preceding decoder block for easier optimization. Although promising, it relies
on the learnable parameterized positional queries which tend to encode the
dataset statistics, leading to inaccurate localization for distinct individual
queries. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective query design for
semantic segmentation termed Dynamic Focus-aware Positional Queries (DFPQ),
which dynamically generates positional queries conditioned on the
cross-attention scores from the preceding decoder block and the positional
encodings for the corresponding image features, simultaneously. Therefore, our
DFPQ preserves rich localization information for the target segments and
provides accurate and fine-grained positional priors. In addition, we propose
to efficiently deal with high-resolution cross-attention by only aggregating
the contextual tokens based on the low-resolution cross-attention scores to
perform local relation aggregation. Extensive experiments on ADE20K and
Cityscapes show that with the two modifications on Mask2former, our framework
achieves SOTA performance and outperforms Mask2former by clear margins of 1.1%,
1.9%, and 1.1% single-scale mIoU with ResNet-50, Swin-T, and Swin-B backbones

metal lines (e.g., CII, MgII, and OI) are discovered in the spectrum, which
indicates the presence of: (i) a proximate sub-damped Ly$\alpha$ (sub-DLA)
system at $z=6.314$ and (ii) a MgII absorber at $z=2.2305$. To describe the
observed damping wing signal, we model the Ly$\alpha$ absorption with a
combination of a sub-DLA with the neutral hydrogen column density of $\log
N_\mathrm{HI} = 20.03 \pm 0.30$ cm$^{-2}$ and absorption from the intergalactic
medium with a neutral fraction of around 10 percent. The sub-DLA toward PSO
J083+11 has an abundance ratio of [C/O] $=-0.04 \pm 0.33$ and metallicity of
[O/H] $=-2.19 \pm 0.44$, similar to those of low-redshift metal-poor DLAs.
These measurements suggest that the sub-DLA might truncate PSO J083+11's
proximity zone size and complicate the quasar lifetime measurement. However,
this quasar shows no sign of a Ly$\alpha$ halo in the MUSE data cube, where the
estimated $1\sigma$ limit of surface brightness is $2.76 \times 10^{-18}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ at aperture size of 1 arcsecond, or equivalent
to a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\leq 43.46$ erg s$^{-1}$. This non-detection,
while being only weak independent evidence on its own, is at least consistent
with a young quasar scenario, as expected for a quasar with a short accretion

Transformer module, applying on batch dimension rather than spatial/channel
dimension, i.e., BatchFormer [18], has been introduced to explore sample
relationships for overcoming data scarcity challenges. However, it only works
with image-level representations for classification. In this paper, we devise a
more general batch Transformer module, BatchFormerV2, which further enables
exploring sample relationships for dense representation learning. Specifically,
when applying the proposed module, it employs a two-stream pipeline during
training, i.e., either with or without a BatchFormerV2 module, where the
batchformer stream can be removed for testing. Therefore, the proposed method
is a plug-and-play module and can be easily integrated into different vision
Transformers without any extra inference cost. Without bells and whistles, we
show the effectiveness of the proposed method for a variety of popular visual
recognition tasks, including image classification and two important dense
prediction tasks: object detection and panoptic segmentation. Particularly,
BatchFormerV2 consistently improves current DETR-based detection methods (e.g.,
DETR, Deformable-DETR, Conditional DETR, and SMCA) by over 1.3%. Code will be

faults of arithmetic and logic operations of embedded processors called FT-EALU
is proposed. In this method, each operation is replicated in time and the
derived final results are voted to generate the final output. To consider the
effect of permanent faults, replicating identical operations in time is not
sufficient, and diversifying the operands is required. To this aim in FT-EALU,
we consider three distinct versions of input data and apply the target
operation to them serially in time. To avoid high time overhead, we employ
simple operators such as shift and swap to make an appropriate diversion in
input data. Our proposed fault tolerance approach passes the replicated and
diverse results to a novel weighted voter that is designed based on the
reward/punishment strategy. For each version of execution, based on the
proposed weighting approach a corresponding weight according to its correction
capability confronting several faulty scenarios is defined. This weight defines
the reliability of the result of each version of execution and determines its
effect on the final result. The final result is generated bit by bit based on
the weight of each execution and its computed result. These weights are
determined statically through a design-time learning scheme according to
applying several types of faults on various data bits. Based on the capability
of execution versions on mitigating the permanent faults, positive or negative
scores are assigned to them. These scores are integrated for several cases and

between RGB images and the surfaces of human bodies, which finds various
applications, such as human body reconstruction, human pose transfer, and human
action recognition. Prior dense pose estimation methods are all based on Mask
R-CNN framework and operate in a top-down manner of first attempting to
identify a bounding box for each person and matching dense correspondences in
each bounding box. Consequently, these methods lack robustness due to their
critical dependence on the Mask R-CNN detection, and the runtime increases
drastically as the number of persons in the image increases. We therefore
propose a novel alternative method for solving the dense pose estimation
problem, called Direct Dense Pose (DDP). DDP first predicts the instance mask
and global IUV representation separately and then combines them together. We
also propose a simple yet effective 2D temporal-smoothing scheme to alleviate
the temporal jitters when dealing with video data. Experiments demonstrate that
DDP overcomes the limitations of previous top-down baseline methods and
achieves competitive accuracy. In addition, DDP is computationally more
efficient than previous dense pose estimation methods, and it reduces jitters
when applied to a video sequence, which is a problem plaguing the previous
methods.

problem of shape completion is inherently ill-posed, and high-quality result
requires scalable solutions that consider multiple possible outcomes. We employ
the Generative Cellular Automata that learns the multi-modal distribution and
transform the formulation to process large-scale continuous geometry. The local
continuous shape is incrementally generated as a sparse voxel embedding, which
contains the latent code for each occupied cell. We formally derive that our
training objective for the sparse voxel embedding maximizes the variational
lower bound of the complete shape distribution and therefore our progressive
generation constitutes a valid generative model. Experiments show that our
model successfully generates diverse plausible scenes faithful to the input,
especially when the input suffers from a significant amount of missing data. We
also demonstrate that our approach outperforms deterministic models even in
less ambiguous cases with a small amount of missing data, which infers that
probabilistic formulation is crucial for high-quality geometry completion on

brings the issue of filter bubbles. E.g., if the system keeps exposing and
recommending the items that the user is interested in, it may also make the
user feel bored and less satisfied. Existing work studies filter bubbles in
static recommendation, where the effect of overexposure is hard to capture. In
contrast, we believe it is more meaningful to study the issue in interactive
recommendation and optimize long-term user satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is
unrealistic to train the model online due to the high cost. As such, we have to
leverage offline training data and disentangle the causal effect on user
satisfaction.
  To achieve this goal, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommender
system (CIRS) that augments offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with
causal inference. The basic idea is to first learn a causal user model on
historical data to capture the overexposure effect of items on user
satisfaction. It then uses the learned causal user model to help the planning
of the RL policy. To conduct evaluation offline, we innovatively create an
authentic RL environment (KuaiEnv) based on a real-world fully observed user
rating dataset. The experiments show the effectiveness of CIRS in bursting
filter bubbles and achieving long-term success in interactive recommendation.

adaptation framework that relies only on silhouette supervision to adapt a

cue (multi-view, depth, or 2D pose), an isolated silhouette loss fails to
provide a reliable pose-specific gradient and requires to be employed in tandem
with a topology-centric loss. To this end, we develop a series of

paves the way to devise a Chamfer-inspired spatial topological-alignment loss

disturbed conditions, especially in the EIA and the magnetic equatorial regions
are vital for understanding the underlying physics as well as for mitigating
space weather hazards on the sophisticated technological systems essential for
human civilization. An important aspect of the space weather studies is the
thorough understanding of coupling between the solar wind and the terrestrial
magnetosphere-ionosphere system and subsequent influence on the low-latitude
ionosphere. This paper presents an effort to understand the influence of actual
values of the north-south component of Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF,
$B_z$) on the vertical plasma drifts at a location near the EIA and the
geomagnetic equator. The strong storm event of October 13, 2016, falling in the
descending phase of solar cycle 24, has been taken up as a case study.
Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM)
simulation runs have been performed under two scenarios: first when no coupling
is present (IMF $B_z$ = 0 nT) and second when actual observations of the values
of IMF $B_z$ is given as inputs to the model. Observations show when actual
data is fed to the model, there is significant shift of the vertical drift
towards westward, while there is an increase in the peak value of the westward
drift after the pre-reversal enhancement. This study is an initial effort to
understand the variations in low-latitude plasma motions during the main phase
of strong geomagnetic storms. This initial work will be followed up with
understanding the global plasma drift variations under the influence of other
components of the IMF near the EIA and the dip equatorial regions.

CHO, describes its future use in vertical areas and provides performance
results showing the gains CHO may offer to 5G systems at higher frequency
bands. Our simulative analysis was focused on the handover in Frequency Range 2
(FR2) and CHO recovery procedure. Results have shown that also at higher
frequencies CHO can substantially reduce the mobility failures compared to
baseline handover of Release 15. Moreover, it has been verified that CHO
recovery can be a useful means to allow faster reconnection to the network
after a failure. In certain scenarios CHO Recovery usage ratio was found to
exceed 80%. The paper also outlines the future research and standardization
directions in the area of CHO which appears to be a solid candidate for further

electric dipole moment (EDM), Schiff moment and magnetic quadrupole moment
(MQM) in the intrinsic frame which rotates with the nucleus. In a state with
definite angular momentum in the laboratory frame, these moments are forbidden
by parity (P) and time reversal invariance (T) conservation, meaning their
expectation values vanish due to nuclear rotation. However, nuclei with an
octupole deformation have doublets of close opposite parity rotational states
with the same spin, which are mixed by T,P-odd nuclear forces. This mixing
produces the orientation of the nuclear axis along nuclear spin and all moments
existing in the intrinsic frame appear in the laboratory frame (provided the
nuclear spin I is sufficiently large to allow such moment). Such a mechanism
produces enhanced T,P-violating nuclear moments. This enhancement also takes
place in nuclei with a soft octupole vibration mode. Schiff moments in such
nuclei have been calculated in previous works. In the present paper we consider
the magnetic quadrupole moment which appears in isotopes with nuclear spin $I

feature modeling. Among all methods, graph convolution networks (GCNs) are
extensively utilized because of their superiority in explicit connection
modeling. Within a GCN, the graph correlation adjacency matrix drives feature
aggregation and is the key to extracting predictive motion features.
State-of-the-art methods decompose the spatiotemporal correlation into spatial
correlations for each frame and temporal correlations for each joint. Directly
parameterizing these correlations introduces redundant parameters to represent
common relations shared by all frames and all joints. Besides, the
spatiotemporal graph adjacency matrix is the same for different motion samples
and cannot reflect sample-wise correspondence variances. To overcome these two
bottlenecks, we propose dynamic spatiotemporal decompose GC (DSTD-GC), which
only takes 28.6% parameters of the state-of-the-art GC. The key of DSTD-GC is
constrained dynamic correlation modeling, which explicitly parameterizes the
common static constraints as a spatial/temporal vanilla adjacency matrix shared
by all frames/joints and dynamically extracts correspondence variances for each
frame/joint with an adjustment modeling function. For each sample, the common
constrained adjacency matrices are fixed to represent generic motion patterns,
while the extracted variances complete the matrices with specific pattern
adjustments. Meanwhile, we mathematically reformulate GCs on spatiotemporal
graphs into a unified form and find that DSTD-GC relaxes certain constraints of
other GC, which contributes to a better representation capability. By combining
DSTD-GC with prior knowledge, we propose a powerful spatiotemporal GCN called
DSTD-GCN, which outperforms SOTA methods by $3.9\% \sim 8.7\%$ in prediction
accuracy with $55.0\% \sim 96.9\%$ fewer parameters.

GNNs encounter significant performance degradation when the amount of

expected as GNNs are trained solely based on the supervision obtained from the
labeled nodes. On the other hand,recent self-supervised learning paradigm aims
to train GNNs by solving pretext tasks that do not require any labeled nodes,
and it has shown to even outperform GNNs trained with few labeled nodes.
However, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of
learning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information
is utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised
method for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that
belong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of
both worlds of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods. Specifically, GraFN
randomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the
entire graph. Then, it minimizes the difference between two predicted class
distributions that are non-parametrically assigned by anchor-supports
similarity from two differently augmented graphs. We experimentally show that
GraFN surpasses both the semi-supervised and self-supervised methods in terms
of node classification on real-world graphs. The source code for GraFN is

Microaggregation is one of the Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) methods
that are widely used by many researchers. This method adapts the k-anonymity
principle to generate k-indistinguishable records in the same clusters to
preserve the privacy of the individuals. However, in these methods, the size of
the clusters is fixed (i.e., k records), and the clusters generated through
these methods may hold non-homogeneous records. By considering these issues, we
propose an adaptive size clustering technique that aggregates homogeneous
records in similar clusters, and the size of the clusters is determined after
the semantic analysis of the records. To achieve this, we extend the MDAV
microaggregation algorithm to semantically analyze the unstructured records by
relying on the taxonomic databases (i.e., WordNet), and then aggregating them
in homogeneous clusters. Furthermore, we propose a distance measure that
determines the extent to which the records differ from each other, and based on
this, homogeneous adaptive clusters are constructed. In experiments, we
measured the cohesiveness of the clusters in order to gauge the homogeneity of
records. In addition, a method is proposed to measure information loss caused

can be preserved for estimation in the next iteration. Second, we introduce and
employ the well-known Otsu's method (from image processing) to conduct
thresholding on the residual errors so as to obtain the best separation
(grouping) statistically which maximizes the between-class variance. Third, to
enhance robustness, we design a multi-layered Otsu's thresholding approach in
combination with our framework to sift out the true inliers from outliers that
might even occupy the majority of measurements. We test our robust estimator
IMOT on 5 different spatial perception problems including: rotation averaging,
rotation search, point cloud registration, category-level registration, and
SLAM. Experiments show that IMOT is robust against 70%--90% of outliers and can
typically converge in only 3--10 iterations, being 3--125 times faster than
existing robust estimators: GNC and ADAPT. Moreover, IMOT is able to return
robust results even without noise bound information.

observatories in the last few decades, the energy range between
$\sim200\;\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sim50\;\mathrm{MeV}$ remains poorly explored.
COMPTEL, on-board the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO, $1991$-$2000$),
opened the MeV gamma-ray band as a new window to astronomy, performing the
first all-sky survey in the energy range from $0.75$ to $30\;\mathrm{MeV}$.
More than $20$ years after the de-orbit of CGRO, no successor mission is yet
operating. Over the past years many concepts have been proposed, for new
observatories exploring different configurations and imaging techniques; a
selection of the most recent ones includes AMEGO, ETCC, GECCO and COSI. We
propose here a novel concept for a Compton telescope based on the CubeSat
standard, named MeVCube, with the advantages of small cost and relatively short
development time. The scientific payload is based on two layers of pixelated
Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CdZnTe) detectors, coupled with low-power read-out
electronics (ASIC, VATA450.3). The performance of the read-out electronics and
CdZnTe custom designed detectors have been measured extensively at DESY. The
performance of the telescope is accessed through simulations: despite a small
effective area limited to a few $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, MeVCube can reach an angular
resolution of $1.5^{\circ}$ and a sensitivity comparable to the one achieved by
the last generation of large-scale satellites like COMPTEL and INTEGRAL.
Combined with a large field-of-view and a moderate cost, MeVCube can be a
powerful instrument for transient observations and searches of electromagnetic
counterparts of gravitational wave events.

(POEAP) in which we aim to calculate the Pareto-front of journeys with respect
to ticket price and arrival time in a public transportation network. Public
transit fare structures are often a combination of various fare strategies such
as, e.g., distance-based fares, zone-based fares or flat fares. The rules that
determine the actual ticket price are often very complex. Accordingly, fare
structures are notoriously difficult to model as it is in general not
sufficient to simply assign costs to arcs in a routing graph. Research into
POEAP is scarce and usually either relies on heuristics or only considers
restrictive fare models that are too limited to cover the full scope of most
real-world applications. We therefore introduce conditional fare networks
(CFNs), the first framework for representing a large number of real-world fare
structures. We show that by relaxing label domination criteria, CFNs can be
used as a building block in label-setting multi-objective shortest path
algorithms. By the nature of their extensive modeling capabilities, optimizing
over CFNs is NP-hard. However, we demonstrate that adapting the multi-criteria
RAPTOR (MCRAP) algorithm for CFNs yields an algorithm capable of solving POEAP
to optimality in less than 400 ms on average on a real-world data set. By
restricting the size of the Pareto-set, running times are further reduced to
below 10 ms.

self-interference is made possible by photon backward scattering incurred by
quantum scatterers in a waveguide working as quantum switches. Whether the
interference is constructive or destructive is found to depend strongly on the
distance between the scatterers and the emitters. The interference between two
propagation pathways of the same photon leads to controllable superradiance and
subradiance, with their collective decay rates much enhanced or suppressed
(also leading to hyperradiance or population trapping). Furthermore, the
self-interference mechanism is manifested by an abrupt change in the emission

  Water is detected in all 19 objects and methane is detected in all of the T

in recent years. Different from the previous urban distribution mode that
depends on trucks, this paper proposes a novel package pick-up and delivery
mode and system in which multiple drones collaborate with automatic devices.
The proposed mode uses free areas on the top of residential buildings to set
automatic devices as delivery and pick-up points of packages, and employs
drones to transport packages between buildings and depots. Integrated
scheduling problem of package drop-pickup considering m-drone, m-depot,
m-customer is crucial for the system. We propose a simulated-annealing-based
two-phase optimization approach (SATO) to solve this problem. In the first
phase, tasks are allocated to depots for serving, such that the initial problem
is decomposed into multiple single depot scheduling problems with m-drone. In
the second phase, considering the drone capability constraints and task demand
constraints, we generate the route planning scheme for drones in each depot.
Concurrently, an improved variable neighborhood descent algorithm (IVND) is
designed in the first phase to reallocate tasks, and a local search algorithm
(LS) are proposed to search the high-quality solution in the second phase.
Finally, extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted to test
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experiments indicate that the
proposed SATO-IVND can reduce the cost by more than 14% in a reasonable time

paper, we present the observation of abrupt transition in three disparate
turbulent thermoacoustic systems: an annular combustor, a swirl-stabilized
combustor, and a preheated bluff-body stabilized combustor. Using a low-order
stochastic thermoacoustic model, we show that the reported abrupt transitions
occur when an initially stable, supercritical limit cycle becomes unstable,
leading to a secondary bifurcation to a large amplitude limit cycle solution.
The states of combustion noise and intermittency observed in these turbulent
combustors are well captured by the additive stochastic noise in the model.
Through amplitude reduction, we analyze the underlying potential functions
affecting the stability of the observed dynamical states. Finally, we make use
of the Fokker-Planck equation, educing the effect of stochastic fluctuations on
subcritical and secondary bifurcation. We conclude that a high enough intensity
of stochastic fluctuations which transforms a subcritical bifurcation into an
intermittency-facilitated continuous transition may have little effect on the
abrupt nature of secondary bifurcation. Our findings imply the high likelihood
of abrupt transitions in turbulent combustors possessing higher-order
nonlinearities where turbulence intensities are disproportionate to the large

By measuring the outcome of an evaluation criterion, developers can make
evidence-based decisions to guide the evolution of their software. Recent
studies highlight the need for enhancing the automation when such experiments
are conducted in iterations. To that end, we contribute a novel artifact that
aims at enhancing the automation of an experimentation pipeline of a
micro-service system relying on the principles of self-adaptation. Concretely,
we propose SEAByTE, an experimental framework for testing novel self-adaptation
solutions to enhance the automation of continuous A/B testing of a
micro-service based system. We illustrate the use of the SEAByTE artifact with
a concrete example.

(e.g., video call, remote presentation, outside voice recording), and its
impact is often unknown. Objective metrics for speech quality have proven
challenging to develop given the multi-dimensionality of factors that affect
speech quality and the difficulty of collecting labeled data. Hypothesizing the
impact of acoustics on speech quality, this paper presents MOSRA: a
non-intrusive multi-dimensional speech quality metric that can predict room
acoustics parameters (SNR, STI, T60, DRR, and C50) alongside the overall mean
opinion score (MOS) for speech quality. By explicitly optimizing the model to
learn these room acoustics parameters, we can extract more informative features
and improve the generalization for the MOS task when the training data is
limited. Furthermore, we also show that this joint training method enhances the
blind estimation of room acoustics, improving the performance of current
state-of-the-art models. An additional side-effect of this joint prediction is
the improvement in the explainability of the predictions, which is a valuable
feature for many applications.

facial action unit (AU) detection primarily focus on modeling various types of
AU relations between corresponding local muscle areas, or simply mining global

among local-global features. We argue that encoding AU features just from one
perspective may not capture the rich contextual information between regional

because of the diversity in expression and individual characteristics. In this
paper, we propose a novel Multi-level Graph Relational Reasoning Network

multi-level (i.e., region-level, pixel-wise and channel-wise level) feature

features via graph neural network can encode the correlation across different
AUs, the pixel-wise and channel-wise feature learning via graph attention
network can enhance the discrimination ability of AU features from global face
features. The fused features from the three levels lead to improved AU
discriminative ability. Extensive experiments on DISFA and BP4D AU datasets

hard-core model with the fugacity parameter $\lambda$ tending to infinity.
Finding the independence ratio of random $d$-regular graphs for some fixed
degree $d$ has received much attention both in random graph theory and in
statistical physics.
  For $d \geq 20$ the problem is conjectured to exhibit 1-step replica symmetry
breaking (1-RSB). The corresponding 1-RSB formula for the independence ratio
was confirmed for (very) large $d$ in a breakthrough paper by Ding, Sly, and
Sun. Furthermore, the so-called interpolation method shows that this 1-RSB
formula is an upper bound for each $d \geq 3$. For $d \leq 19$ this bound is
not tight and full-RSB is expected.
  In this work we use numerical optimization to find good substituting
parameters for discrete $r$-RSB formulas ($r=2,3,4,5$) to obtain improved
rigorous upper bounds for the independence ratio for each degree $3 \leq d \leq
19$. As $r$ grows, these formulas get increasingly complicated and it becomes
challenging to compute their numerical values efficiently. Also, the functions
to minimize have a large number of local minima, making global optimization a
difficult task.

ambiguous speaker embeddings. Such ambiguous guidance information may confuse

two stages. In the training phase, we propose to integrate metric learning
methods to improve the distinguishability of embeddings produced by the speaker
encoder. While for inference, a novel post-filtering strategy is designed to
revise the wrong results. Specifically, we first identify these confusion
samples by measuring the similarities between output estimates and enrollment

induce non-collinear magnetic order including magnetic-field stabilized
skyrmions, it is the frustration of exchange interactions that can drive
magnetic order down to the nano-scale. On top of that, interactions between
multiple spins can stabilize two-dimensional magnetic textures as zero-field
ground states, known as multi-Q states. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional
itinerant magnet with various competing atomic-scale magnetic phases. Using
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy we observe several zero-field
uniaxial or hexagonal nano-scale magnetic states. First-principles calculations
together with an atomistic spin model reveal that these states are stabilized

they can all be simulated via rejection sampling using Devroye's approach. This

uses a very simple envelope whose acceptance rate is guaranteed to be at least
20\%. The aim of this paper is threefold: firstly, to warn against the risk of

Devroye's automatic method as a practical standard in the case of log-concave

computational efficiency, but a complete understanding of why SGD performs so
well remains a major challenge. It has been observed empirically that most
eigenvalues of the Hessian of the loss functions on the loss landscape of
over-parametrized deep neural networks are close to zero, while only a small
number of eigenvalues are large. Zero eigenvalues indicate zero diffusion along
the corresponding directions. This indicates that the process of minima
selection mainly happens in the relatively low-dimensional subspace

pursue a truly data driven approach to the problem of getting a potentially
deeper understanding of the high-dimensional parameter surface, and in
particular, of the landscape traced out by SGD by analyzing the data generated
through SGD, or any other optimizer for that matter, in order to possibly
discover (local) low-dimensional representations of the optimization landscape.

causing a shift in focus from the pursuit of ever-higher prediction accuracy
with complex models towards practical, deployable solutions that balance
accuracy and parameters such as prediction speed. An MTSC model that has
attracted attention recently is ROCKET, based on random convolutional kernels,
both because of its very fast training process and its state-of-the-art
accuracy. However, the large number of features it utilizes may be detrimental
to inference time. Examining its theoretical background and limitations enables
us to address potential drawbacks and present LightWaveS: a framework for
accurate MTSC, which is fast both during training and inference. Specifically,
utilizing wavelet scattering transformation and distributed feature selection,
we manage to create a solution that employs just 2.5% of the ROCKET features,
while achieving accuracy comparable to recent MTSC models. LightWaveS also
scales well across multiple compute nodes and with the number of input channels
during training. In addition, it can significantly reduce the input size and
provide insight to an MTSC problem by keeping only the most useful channels. We
present three versions of our algorithm and their results on distributed
training time and scalability, accuracy, and inference speedup. We show that we
achieve speedup ranging from 9x to 53x compared to ROCKET during inference on

quantum critical point twice. The two linear ramps arouse two respective
nonadiabatic critical dynamics that are well described by the quantum
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. However, in combination, the two critical dynamics can
interfere with each other deeply. As an effect of the interference, the
dynamical phase is exposed in the final excitation probability, which leads to
a quantum coherent many-body oscillation in the density of defects with
predictable characteristic period. Thus such an interference is available for
direct experimental observations. In the quantum $XY$ model, we show that an
interference can also arise from the interplay between two different critical
dynamics derived from a critical point and a tricritical point. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the interference influences the dephasing of the excited
quasiparticle modes intricately by disclosing a phenomenon of multiple length
scales, diagonal and off-diagonal ones, in the defect-defect correlators. It
turns out that the dephased result relies on how the diagonal and off-diagonal

find that many observed characteristics of 15 long GRBs, which have the highest
prompt emission efficiency $\epsilon _{\gamma}$ ($\epsilon_{\gamma }\gtrsim
80\%$), strongly support the photosphere (thermal) emission origin: (1) the
relation between $E_{\text{p}}$ and $E_{\text{iso}}$ is almost
$E_{\text{p}}\propto (E_{\text{iso}})^{1/4}$ , and the dispersion is quite
small; (2) the simple power-law shape of the X-ray afterglow light curves and
the significant reverse shock signals in the optical afterglow light curves;
(3) best-fitted by the cutoff power-law model for the time-integrated spectrum;
(4) the consistent efficiency from observation (with $E_{\text{iso}}/E_{k}$)
and the prediction of photosphere emission model (with $\eta /\Gamma $). Then,
we further investigate the characteristics of the long GRBs for two
distinguished samples ($\epsilon _{\gamma }\gtrsim 50\%$ and $\epsilon _{\gamma
}\lesssim 50\%$). It is found that the different distributions for
$E_{\text{p}}$ and $E_{\text{iso}}$, and the similar observed efficiency (from
the X-ray afterglow) and theoretically predicted efficiency (from the prompt
emission or the optical afterglow) well follow the prediction of photosphere
emission model. Also, based on the same efficiency, we derive an excellent
correlation of $\Gamma \propto
E_{\text{iso}}^{1/8}E_{\text{p}}^{1/2}/(T_{90})^{1/4}$ to estimate $\Gamma $.
Finally, the different distributions for $E_{\text{p}}$ and $E_{\text{iso}}$,
and the consistent efficiency exist for the short GRBs. Besides, we give a

role in the engineering of novel magnetic materials. To achieve exchange
coupling, a two-phase microstructure is necessary. This interface effect is
further enhanced if both phase dimensions are reduced to the nanometer scale.
At the same time, it is challenging to obtain large sample dimensions. In this
study, powder blends and ball-milled powder blends of Fe-SmCo$_{5}$ are
consolidated and are deformed by high-pressure torsion (HPT), as this technique
allows us to produce bulk magnetic materials of reasonable sizes. Additionally,
the effect of severe deformation by ball-milling and severe plastic deformation
by HPT on exchange coupling in Fe-SmCo$_{5}$ composites is investigated. Due to
the applied shear deformation, it is possible to obtain a texture in both
phases, resulting in an anisotropic magnetic behavior and an improved magnetic
performance.

our discussion on the dominant timescales with which the pores charge and how
these timescales depend on three dimensionless numbers. Next to the
dimensionless applied potential $\Phi$, we consider the ratio $R/R_b$ of the
pore's resistance $R$ to the bulk reservoir resistance $R_b$ and the ratio
$r_{p}/\lambda$ of the pore radius $r_p$ to the Debye length $\lambda$. We

little is known what effect pruning has on zero-shot test performance and its
potential implications on the choice of pruning criteria. This pruning setup is
particularly important for cross-lingual models that implicitly learn alignment
between language representations during pretraining, which if distorted via
pruning, not only leads to poorer performance on language data used for
retraining but also on zero-shot languages that are evaluated.
  In this work, we show that there is a clear performance discrepancy in
magnitude-based pruning when comparing standard supervised learning to the
zero-shot setting. From this finding, we propose two weight regularizers that
aim to maximize the alignment between units of pruned and unpruned networks to
mitigate alignment distortion in pruned cross-lingual models and perform well
for both non zero-shot and zero-shot settings.
  We provide experimental results on cross-lingual tasks for the zero-shot
setting using XLM-RoBERTa$_{\mathrm{Base}}$, where we also find that pruning
has varying degrees of representational degradation depending on the language
corresponding to the zero-shot test set. This is also the first study that
focuses on cross-lingual language model compression.

hardware-agnostic differentiable renderer called Dressi, which is based on a
new full AD design. The DR algorithms of Dressi are fully written in our
Vulkan-based AD for DR, Dressi-AD, which supports all primitive operations for
DR. Dressi-AD and our inverse UV technique inside it bring hardware
independence and acceleration by graphics hardware. Stage packing, our runtime
optimization technique, can adapt hardware constraints and efficiently execute
complex computational graphs of DR with reactive cache considering the render
pass hierarchy of Vulkan. HardSoftRas, our novel rendering process, is designed
for inverse rendering with a graphics pipeline. Under the limited

interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained under a regularization with the aim of
avoiding nonphysical heat flux. Specifically, we introduce a regularization
term for the heat flux into the cost function of MLIPs to be minimized. Since
the treatment of heat flux using MLIPs with regularization can be decomposed
into elemental contributions or conducted in frequency space, this approach is
expected to be useful for investigating the origin of thermal conductivity
obtained from the Green-Kubo formula. However, the strength of regularization
needs to be appropriately set because it may reduce not only the nonphysical
part but also the intrinsic heat flux one. To this end, we investigated the
conditions for constructing MLIPs that can reproduce the power spectra of heat
flux associated with the empirical interatomic potential of Ag$_2$Se, which
consists of pairwise functions and do not contain a nonphysical heat flux. The
appropriate strength could be estimated from the variation of the magnitude of
regularization term as well as root mean square errors for total potential
energy, atomic force, and virial stress with respect to the strengths, without
reference spectrum data. As an application example, we explored the differences
in power spectra between superionic and nonsuperionic conducting phases based
on the heat flux regularization to MLIPs trained with the first-principles
calculation data of Ag$_2$S. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that training
with the regularization improves the robustness of MLIPs as well as the
reduction of the nonphysical heat flux.

We examine the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of accreting matter in
terms of the flow parameters, namely energy (${\cal E}$), angular momentum
(${\cal L}$), and local magnetic fields. For a thin GRMHD flow, we observe that
toroidal component ($b^\phi$) of the magnetic fields generally dominates over
radial component ($b^r$) at the disk equatorial plane. This evidently suggests
that toroidal magnetic field indeed plays important role in regulating the disk
dynamics. We further notice that the disk remains mostly gas pressure ($p_{\rm
gas}$) dominated ($\beta = p_{\rm gas}/p_{\rm mag} > 1$, $p_{\rm mag}$ refers
magnetic pressure) except at the near horizon region, where magnetic fields
become dynamically important ($\beta \sim 1$). We observe that Maxwell stress
is developed that eventually yields angular momentum transport inside the disk.
Towards this, we calculate the viscosity parameter ($\alpha$) that appears to
be radially varying. In addition, we examine the underlying scaling relation
between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which clearly distinguishes two domains coexisted
along the radial extent of the disk. Finally, we discuss the utility of the

extracting the fundamental properties of quantum many-body systems. While
spectroscopy provides precise measurements of equilibrated energies,
interferometry can elucidate the dynamical evolution of the system. For an
impurity immersed in a bosonic medium, both are equally important for
understanding the quasiparticle physics of the Bose polaron. Here, we compare
the interferometric and spectroscopic timescales to the underlying dynamical
regimes of the impurity dynamics and the polaron lifetime, highlighting the
capability of the interferometric approach to clearly resolve polaron dynamics.
In particular, interferometric measurements of the coherence amplitude at
strong interactions reveal faster quantum dynamics at large repulsive
interaction strengths than at unitarity. These observations are in excellent
agreement with a short-time theoretical prediction including both the continuum
and the attractive polaron branch. For longer times, qualitative agreement with
a many-body theoretical prediction which includes both branches is obtained.
Moreover, the polaron energy is extracted from interferometric measurements of
the observed phase velocity in agreement with previous spectroscopic results
from weak to strong attractive interactions. Finally, the phase evolution
allows for the measurement of an energetic equilibration timescale, describing
the initial approach of the phase velocity to the polaron energy.
Theoretically, this is shown to lie within the regime of universal dynamics
revealing a fast initial evolution towards the formation of polarons. Our
results give a comprehensive picture of the many-body physics governing the
Bose polaron and thus validates the quasiparticle framework for further

is to maximize the value of the selected item and compete against the expected

to surpass the barrier, including the i.i.d. model, the order selection model,
and the random order model.
  In this paper, we advance the study of the order selection prophet

  I show that the following quantum systems are governed by this Hamiltonian,
and at any time they are in an eigenstate of its canonical conjugate
$\widehat{\tau}$, which plays the role of a time operator:
  1. the measuring device and the observed system in the standard model of
ideal measurements,
  2. any quantum world which contains an isolated subsystem with the
Hamiltonian $\widehat{H}=-i\hbar\frac{\partial\ }{\partial\tau}$, for example
an ideal isolated clock or a sterile massless fermion in a certain eigenstate,
  3. the quantum representation of any deterministic time-reversible dynamical
system without time loops. All properties of the dynamical system are
faithfully encoded as quantum observables.
  The energy spectrum of these systems is $\mathbb{R}$, yet I show that there
is no decay to infinite negative energy nor the possibility to extract infinite
amounts of free energy, contrary to well-known claims.
  Two such quantum systems may be unitarily equivalent, but the physical
content of their observables may be very different, allowing unlimited
diversity and complexity. This gives concrete counterexamples to the ""Hilbert

analysis of the electrical microwave noise delivered by an inductive antenna
placed in its vicinity. The measurements are conducted on a synthetic
antiferromagnetic thin stripe covered by a micron-sized antenna that feeds a
spectrum analyser after amplification. The antenna noise contains two
contributions. The population of incoherent spin waves generates a fluctuating
field that is sensed by the antenna: this is the ""magnon noise"". The antenna
noise also contains the contribution of the electronic fluctuations: the
Johnson-Nyquist noise. The latter depends on all impedances within the
measurement circuit, which includes the antenna self-inductance. As a result,
the electronic noise contains information about the magnetic susceptibility of
the stripe, though it does not inform on the absolute amplitude of the magnetic
fluctuations. For micrometer-sized systems at thermal equilibrium, the
electronic noise dominates and the pure magnon noise cannot be determined. If
in contrast the spinwave bath is not at thermal equilibrium with the
measurement circuit, and if the spin wave population can be changed then one
could measure a mode-resolved effective magnon temperature provided specific
precautions are implemented.

with different resolutions, e.g., those acquired with a tele-wide camera

diverse real-world systems, we start from an unsupervised learning perspective.
However, resolution asymmetry caused by unknown degradations between two views
hinders the effectiveness of the generally assumed photometric consistency. To
overcome this challenge, we propose to impose the consistency between two views
in a feature space instead of the image space, named feature-metric
consistency. Interestingly, we find that, although a stereo matching network
trained with the photometric loss is not optimal, its feature extractor can
produce degradation-agnostic and matching-specific features. These features can
then be utilized to formulate a feature-metric loss to avoid the photometric
inconsistency. Moreover, we introduce a self-boosting strategy to optimize the
feature extractor progressively, which further strengthens the feature-metric
consistency. Experiments on both simulated datasets with various degradations
and a self-collected real-world dataset validate the superior performance of
the proposed method over existing solutions.

However, because neural networks are hard to interpret, it can be difficult to
tell whether agents have learned the underlying abstraction, or alternatively
statistical patterns that are characteristic of that abstraction. In this work,
we compare the performance of humans and agents in a meta-reinforcement
learning paradigm in which tasks are generated from abstract rules. We define a
novel methodology for building ""task metamers"" that closely match the
statistics of the abstract tasks but use a different underlying generative
process, and evaluate performance on both abstract and metamer tasks. We find
that humans perform better at abstract tasks than metamer tasks whereas common
neural network architectures typically perform worse on the abstract tasks than
the matched metamers. This work provides a foundation for characterizing

WildNet, which learns domain-generalized features by leveraging a variety of

generalization ability for unseen target domains is clearly due to overfitting
to the source domain. To address this problem, previous works have focused on
generalizing the domain by removing or diversifying the styles of the source
domain. These alleviated overfitting to the source-style but overlooked
overfitting to the source-content. In this paper, we propose to diversify both
the content and style of the source domain with the help of the wild. Our main
idea is for networks to naturally learn domain-generalized semantic information
from the wild. To this end, we diversify styles by augmenting source features
to resemble wild styles and enable networks to adapt to a variety of styles.
Furthermore, we encourage networks to learn class-discriminant features by
providing semantic variations borrowed from the wild to source contents in the
feature space. Finally, we regularize networks to capture consistent semantic
information even when both the content and style of the source domain are
extended to the wild. Extensive experiments on five different datasets validate
the effectiveness of our WildNet, and we significantly outperform

heterostructure to experimentally investigate charge transport between two
ferroelectric van der Waals materials with different polarization directions.
WTe$_2$ is a polar metal with out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization, while
SnSe ferroelectric semiconductor is polarized in-plane, so one should expect
complicated polarization structure at the SnSe/WTe$_2$ interface. We study
$dI/dV(V)$ curves, which demonstrate sharp symmetric drop to zero $dI/dV$
differential conductance at some threshold bias voltages $\pm V_{th}$, which
are nearly symmetric in respect to the bias sign. While the gate electric field
is too small to noticeably affect the carrier concentration, the positive and
negative threshold positions are sensitive to the gate voltage. Also,
SnSe/WTe$_2$ heterostructure shows re-entrant transition to the low-conductive
$dI/dV=0$ state for abrupt change of the bias voltage even below the threshold
values. This behavior can not be observed for single SnSe or WTe$_2$ flakes, so
we interpret it as a result of the SnSe/WTe$_2$ interface coupling. In this
case, some threshold value of the electric field at the SnSe/WTe$_2$ interface
is enough to drive 90$^\circ$ change of the initial SnSe in-plane polarization
in the overlap region. The polarization mismatch leads to the significant
interface resistance contribution, analogously to the scattering of the charge
carriers on the domain walls. Thus, we demonstrate polarization state control
by electron transport through the SnSe/WTe$_2$ interface.

suffer from the test-time bottleneck. Although several common space-based

In this paper, to tackle the dilemma of speed-accuracy tradeoff, we propose a
commonsense-aware cross-modal alignment (CCA) framework, which incorporates
commonsense-guided visual and text representations into a complementary common
space for fast video temporal grounding. Specifically, the commonsense concepts
are explored and exploited by extracting the structural semantic information
from a language corpus. Then, a commonsense-aware interaction module is
designed to obtain bridged visual and text features by utilizing the learned
commonsense concepts. Finally, to maintain the original semantic information of
textual queries, a cross-modal complementary common space is optimized to
obtain matching scores for performing FVTG. Extensive results on two
challenging benchmarks show that our CCA method performs favorably against

the asymmetry of the stellar component in a sample of well-resolved disky

161 objects with significant asymmetry in terms of the m=1 Fourier mode of the
stellar component within (1-2) stellar half-mass radii and describe their
properties using three representative examples. The profiles of the m=1 mode
typically increase with radius, and the corresponding phase is constant in the
asymmetric region, signifying a global distortion. Following the evolution of
the lopsided disks over time, we find that their history is rather uneventful
and the occurrence of the asymmetry is fairly recent. Only about 1/3 of the
lopsided disks experienced any strong interaction recently that could have led
to the distortion of their shape: 24% were affected by a more massive object
and 9% underwent a gas-rich merger. Still, a majority of lopsided disks show a
significant increase in their recent star formation rate. The most frequent
mechanism for the formation of lopsided disks thus seems to be asymmetric star
formation probably related to gas accretion, although the distortions in the
gas and stars are not strongly correlated. This picture is supported by the
finding that the lopsided population on average contains more gas, has higher
star formation rate, lower metallicity and bluer color than the remaining
disks. These correlations are similar to those seen in real galaxies, even
though the fraction of simulated lopsided disks (8%) is much lower than in
observations (30%). The observed correlation between the presence of the
asymmetry and a bar is not reproduced either. These discrepancies may be due to
overquenching or insufficient resolution of IllustrisTNG simulations.

confirm that heat diffusion is a critical factor in reducing the time delay for

computers and artificial intelligence poses one ultimate question: How can
advanced artificial systems contribute to scientific understanding or achieve
it autonomously?
  We are convinced that this is not a mere technical question but lies at the
core of science. Therefore, here we set out to answer where we are and where we
can go from here. We first seek advice from the philosophy of science to
understand scientific understanding. Then we review the current state of the
art, both from literature and by collecting dozens of anecdotes from scientists
about how they acquired new conceptual understanding with the help of
computers. Those combined insights help us to define three dimensions of
android-assisted scientific understanding: The android as a I) computational
microscope, II) resource of inspiration and the ultimate, not yet existent III)
agent of understanding. For each dimension, we explain new avenues to push
beyond the status quo and unleash the full power of artificial intelligence's
contribution to the central aim of science. We hope our perspective inspires
and focuses research towards androids that get new scientific understanding and
ultimately bring us closer to true artificial scientists.

a trajectory by solving a parameterized nonlinear program (NLP) which contains
path progress and smoothness in cost terms. By observing the actual motion of a

Within this context we introduce four models of increasing complexity, in each
case introducing additional mechanisms that govern the interaction of the MTs
with the cell boundary. In order, we consider the cases: MTs that can bind to
the boundary with a fixed mean residence time (M0), force-producing MTs that
can slide on the boundary towards the cell poles (MS), MTs that interact with a
generic polarity factor that is transported and deposited at the boundary, and
which in turn stabilizes the MTs at the boundary (MP), and a final model in
which both sliding and stabilization by polarity factors is taken into account
(MSP). In the baseline model (M0), the exponential length distribution of MTs
causes most of the interactions at the cell boundary to occur along the shorter
transverse direction in the cell, leading to transverse biaxial order. MT
sliding (MS) is able to reorient the main axis of this biaxial order along the
longitudinal axis. The polarization mechanism introduced in MP and MSP
overrules the geometric bias towards bipolar order observed in M0 and MS, and
allows the establishment of unipolar order either along the short- (MP) or the
long cell axis (MSP). The behavior of the latter two models can be
qualitatively reproduced by a very simple toy model with discrete MT
orientations.

Meanwhile, diverse testing sets are also provided with different types of

testing images. The diversity of reflections and scenes further makes it a
mission impossible to learn a single model being effective to all testing sets
and real-world reflections. In this paper, we tackle these issues by learning
SIRR models from a domain generalization perspective. Particularly, for each
source set, a specific SIRR model is trained to serve as a domain expert of
relevant reflection types. For a given reflection-contaminated image, we
present a reflection type-aware weighting (RTAW) module to predict expert-wise
weights. RTAW can then be incorporated with adaptive network combination
(AdaNEC) for handling different reflection types and scenes, i.e., generalizing
to unknown domains. Two representative AdaNEC methods, i.e., output fusion (OF)

levels and efficiency. For images from one source set, we train RTAW to only
predict expert-wise weights of other domain experts for improving
generalization ability, while the weights of all experts are predicted and
employed during testing. An in-domain expert (IDE) loss is presented for
training RTAW. Extensive experiments show the appealing performance gain of our
AdaNEC on different state-of-the-art SIRR networks. Source code and pre-trained

the vacuum case, we explore the near horizon near extremal Kerr metric, which
is also a vacuum solution to Conformal Weyl gravity and not previously studied
in this setting. For the non-vacuum case we couple the conformal Weyl gravity
field equations to a near horizon (linear) $U(1)$ gauge potential and analyze
the respective found solutions. We highlight the non-universality of black hole
entropy between our studied black hole solutions of varying symmetries. However
despite non-universality, the respective black hole entropies are in congruence
with Wald's entropy formula for the specific gravity theory. Finally and
despite non-universality, we comment on the construction of a near horizon CFT
dual to one of our unique non-vacuum solutions. Due to the non-universality, we
must introduce a parameter (similarly to entropy calculations in LQG) which we
also call $\gamma$ and relating to the Weyl anomaly coefficient. The
construction follows an $AdS_2/CFT_1$ correspondence in the near horizon, which

functions or data mining strategies for training such networks. Most methods

to different groups. Guided by the smoothness assumption that ""similar objects

localization is required. An additional challenge is the need of path order
information to apply the appropriate geometric relationships between the

paper, we propose a low complexity channel estimation strategy of the angle of
departure and time difference of arrival based on multidimensional orthogonal

of the channel paths so only the LoS and first order reflections are used for
localization. Simulation results obtained with realistic vehicular channels

applications. Despite the numerous developments in visual tracking, existing
deep trackers are still likely to fail when tracking against objects with
dramatic variation. These deep trackers usually do not perform online update or
update single sub-branch of the tracking model, for which they cannot adapt to
the appearance variation of objects. Efficient updating methods are therefore
crucial for tracking while previous meta-updater optimizes trackers directly
over parameter space, which is prone to over-fit even collapse on longer
sequences. To address these issues, we propose a context-aware tracking model
to optimize the tracker over the representation space, which jointly
meta-update both branches by exploiting information along the whole sequence,
such that it can avoid the over-fitting problem. First, we note that the
embedded features of the localization branch and the box-estimation branch,
focusing on the local and global information of the target, are effective
complements to each other. Based on this insight, we devise a
context-aggregation module to fuse information in historical frames, followed
by a context-aware module to learn affinity vectors for both branches of the
tracker. Besides, we develop a dedicated meta-learning scheme, on account of
fast and stable updating with limited training samples. The proposed tracking
method achieves an EAO score of 0.514 on VOT2018 with the speed of 40FPS,
demonstrating its capability of improving the accuracy and robustness of the

friction at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and inner core boundary (ICB).
Viscous friction at the CMB generates a phase lead, viscous and EM friction at
the ICB produce a phase lag; the magnitude of the deviation depends on the
inner core size, kinematic viscosity and magnetic field strength, but cannot
exceed an upper bound. For a small inner core, viscous friction at the CMB
results in a maximum phase lead of 0.027 arcsec. For a large inner core (radius
$>1000$ km), EM friction at the ICB generates the largest phase lag, but it
does not exceed 0.1 arcsec. Elastic deformations induced by the misaligned
fluid and solid cores play a first order role in the phase lead/lag caused by
viscous and EM coupling, and contribute to a perturbation in mantle obliquity
on par with that caused by tidal deformations. Tidal dissipation results in a
phase lag and its magnitude (in units of arcsec) is given by the empirical
relation (80/Q), where Q is the quality factor; Q=80 results in a phase lag of
~1 arcsec. A large inner core with a low viscosity of the order of 10^{17} Pa s
or lower can significantly affect $Q$ and thus the resulting phase lag. The
limited mantle phase lag suggested by observations (<10 arcsec) implies a lower

topologies that can help reduce switching losses and increase power density.
Gate driving techniques that offer zero-voltage switching and/or zero current
switching have recently been successfully proposed for different modular
multilevel converters such as the cascaded H bridge. Previous papers on other
multilevel converters such as the multi-active bridge, however, do not
sufficiently assess the topics of gate driver design for this topology. This
work presents a novel isolated gate driver architecture tailored to the
multi-active bridge topology. Zero voltage switching is then achieved using two
multi-winding transformers. The advantages of the proposed topology are not
only a reduction of switching losses but also reduced component count.
  The topology is evaluated on a prototype using experimental results.
  It was shown using simulation and experiments that the proposed topology has
a high efficiency while providing compact power packaging.
  Especially for converters with many levels, the proposed topology is
therefore advantageous compared to existing solutions.

To solve this problem, we first approximate parameter sets with inscribed

prove that an equilibrium obtained from the algorithm induces an

detection scenarios via distributed estimation over sensor networks. In the
stateful case, the detector keeps track of the sensor residuals (i.e., the
difference of estimated and true outputs) and reports an alarm if certain
statistics of the recorded residuals deviate over a predefined threshold, e.g.,
\chi^2 (Chi-square) detector. Instead, only instantaneous deviation of the
residuals raises the alarm in the stateless case without considering the
history of the sensor outputs and estimation data. Given (approximate)
false-alarm rate for both cases, we propose a probabilistic threshold design
based on the noise statistics. We show by simulation that increasing the window
length in the stateful case may not necessarily reduce the false-alarm rate. On
the other hand, it adds unwanted delay to raise the alarm. The distributed
aspect of the proposed detection algorithm enables local isolation of the
faulty sensors with possible recovery solutions by adding redundant
observationally-equivalent sensors. We, then, offer a mechanism to design
Q-redundant distributed observers, robust to failure (or removal) of up to Q
sensors over the network.

where $p_F\not\in\omega$, with the topology in which every element of $\omega$
is isolated whereas all open neighborhoods of $p_F$ are of the form
$A\cup\{p_F\}$ for $A\in F$. Spaces of the form $N_F$ constitute the class of
the simplest non-discrete Tychonoff spaces. The aim of this paper is to study
them in the context of the celebrated Josefson--Nissenzweig theorem from Banach
space theory. We prove, e.g., that a space $N_F$ carries a sequence
$\langle\mu_n\colon n\in\omega\rangle$ of normalized finitely supported signed
measures such that $\mu_n(f)\to 0$ for every bounded continuous real-valued
function $f$ on $N_F$ if and only if there is a density submeasure $\varphi$ on
$\omega$ such that the dual ideal $F^*$ is contained in the exhaustive ideal
$\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$. Consequently, we get that if $F$ is a free filter on
$\omega$ contained in the filter dual to a density ideal, then: (1) if $X$ is a
Tychonoff space and $N_F$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of $X$, then the space
$C_p^*(X)$ of bounded continuous real-valued functions on $X$ contains a
complemented copy of the space $c_0$ endowed with the pointwise topology, (2)
if $K$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $N_F$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of
$K$, then the Banach space $C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $K$ is
not a Grothendieck space. The latter result generalizes the well-known fact
stating that if a compact Hausdorff space $K$ contains a non-trivial convergent
sequence, then the space $C(K)$ is not Grothendieck. We also prove that the set
of filters which can be covered by filters dual to density ideals contains a
family of $2^\omega$ many mutually non-isomorphic $\mathbb{F}_\sigma$ P-filters
and a family of $2^{2^\omega}$ many mutually non-isomorphic non-Borel filters.

  VAE",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studies on the automatic processing of 3D human pose data have flourished in
the recent past. In this paper, we are interested in the generation of
plausible and diverse future human poses following an observed 3D pose
sequence. Current methods address this problem by injecting random variables
from a single latent space into a deterministic motion prediction framework,
which precludes the inherent multi-modality in human motion generation. In
addition, previous works rarely explore the use of attention to select which
frames are to be used to inform the generation process up to our knowledge. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Hierarchical Transformer Dynamical
Variational Autoencoder, HiT-DVAE, which implements auto-regressive generation
with transformer-like attention mechanisms. HiT-DVAE simultaneously learns the
evolution of data and latent space distribution with time correlated
probabilistic dependencies, thus enabling the generative model to learn a more
complex and time-varying latent space as well as diverse and realistic human
motions. Furthermore, the auto-regressive generation brings more flexibility on
observation and prediction, i.e. one can have any length of observation and
predict arbitrary large sequences of poses with a single pre-trained model. We
evaluate the proposed method on HumanEva-I and Human3.6M with various
evaluation methods, and outperform the state-of-the-art methods on most of the
metrics.

access to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data).
Also, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over
it. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of
'test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their

trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test

on detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and
obtaining their low frequency component at our proposed suitable radius for
model prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique via
extensive experiments against several adversarial attacks and for different

Also, we significantly improve the adversarial accuracy from 0% to 37.37% with

Studies of this have generally focused on fields applied along high symmetry

calculate the associated Kasteleyn temperature $T_K$ as a function of field

follow a wound-induced electric field. In addition to their stereotypical
persistent motion, keratocytes can develop circular motion without a field or
oscillate around the field direction. We developed a coarse-grained
phenomenological model that captures these keratocyte behaviors. We fit this
model to experimental data on keratocyte response to an electric field being
turned on. A critical element of our model is a tendency for cells to turn
toward their long axis, arising from a coupling between cell shape and
velocity, which gives rise to oscillatory and circular motion. Galvanotaxis is
influenced not only by the field-dependent responses, but also cell speed and
cell shape relaxation rate. When the cell reacts to an electric field being
turned on, our model predicts that stiff, slow cells react slowly but follow
the signal reliably. Cells that polarize and align to the field at a faster
rate react more quickly and follow the signal more reliably. When cells are
exposed to a field that switches direction rapidly, cells follow the average of
field directions, while if the field is switched more slowly, cells follow a
""staircase"" pattern.

with some young B-type runaways found several tens of kiloparsecs from the

likely place of origin, and ejection may be either through N-body interactions
or in binary supernova explosions. The excellent quality of Gaia astrometry
opens up the path to study the kinematics of young runaway stars to such a high
precision that the place of origin in open stellar clusters can be identified
uniquely. We developed an efficient minimization method to calculate whether
two or more objects may come from the same place, which we tested against
samples of Orion runaways. Our fitting procedure was then used to calculate
trajectories for known runaway stars where we used Gaia data and updated radial
velocities. We found that only half of the sample could be classified as
runaways while the others were walkaway stars. Most of the latter stars turned
out to be binaries. We identified parent clusters for runaways based on their
trajectories and then used cluster age and flight time of the stars to
investigate whether the ejection was likely due to a binary supernova or due to
a dynamical ejection. In particular, we show that the classical runaways AE
Aurigae and $\mu$ Columbae might not have originated together, with $\mu$
Columbae having an earlier ejection from Collinder 69, a cluster near the ONC.
The second sample investigated comprises a set of distant runaway B stars in
the halo which have been studied carefully by quantitative spectral analyses.
We are able to identify candidate parent clusters for at least four stars
including the hyper-runaway candidate HIP 60350. The ejection events had to be
very violent, ejecting stars at velocities as large as 150 to 400 km/s.

neurons without feedback connections can still receive a global learning
signal. In hardware, this provides an approach for global supervised learning
without backward connectivity. Sigprop by construction has compatibility with
models of learning in the brain and in hardware than backpropagation, including
alternative approaches relaxing learning constraints. We also demonstrate that
sigprop is more efficient in time and memory than they are. To further explain
the behavior of sigprop, we provide evidence that sigprop provides useful

a challenging task due to 1) the inherent information insufficiency of lip
movement to fully represent the speech, and 2) the existence of homophenes that
have similar lip movement with different pronunciations. In this paper, we try
to alleviate the aforementioned two challenges in lip reading by proposing a
Multi-head Visual-audio Memory (MVM). Firstly, MVM is trained with audio-visual
datasets and remembers audio representations by modelling the
inter-relationships of paired audio-visual representations. At the inference
stage, visual input alone can extract the saved audio representation from the
memory by examining the learned inter-relationships. Therefore, the lip reading
model can complement the insufficient visual information with the extracted
audio representations. Secondly, MVM is composed of multi-head key memories for
saving visual features and one value memory for saving audio knowledge, which
is designed to distinguish the homophenes. With the multi-head key memories,
MVM extracts possible candidate audio features from the memory, which allows
the lip reading model to consider the possibility of which pronunciations can
be represented from the input lip movement. This also can be viewed as an
explicit implementation of the one-to-many mapping of viseme-to-phoneme.
Moreover, MVM is employed in multi-temporal levels to consider the context when
retrieving the memory and distinguish the homophenes. Extensive experimental
results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in lip reading and in
distinguishing the homophenes.

network, Visual Context Attentional GAN (VCA-GAN), which can jointly model

proposed VCA-GAN synthesizes the speech from local lip visual features by
finding a mapping function of viseme-to-phoneme, while global visual context is
embedded into the intermediate layers of the generator to clarify the ambiguity
in the mapping induced by homophene. To achieve this, a visual context
attention module is proposed where it encodes global representations from the
local visual features, and provides the desired global visual context
corresponding to the given coarse speech representation to the generator
through audio-visual attention. In addition to the explicit modelling of local
and global visual representations, synchronization learning is introduced as a
form of contrastive learning that guides the generator to synthesize a speech
in sync with the given input lip movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed VCA-GAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art and is able to
effectively synthesize the speech from multi-speaker that has been barely

phase gauge symmetry of the quantum field below the critical temperature. The
coupling and gauge symmetry breaking can be understood as due to spontaneous
quantum fluctuations of two-dimensional time and the corresponding finite
entropy at equilibrium, which does not rely on coherent particle interactions.
In this context, defining a gauge for the quantum field at the Boltzmann
equilibrium is a necessary and sufficient condition for maximization of entropy
and spontaneous symmetry breaking at thermal equilibrium in the parameter
regime of the present model. The concept of two-dimensional time finally
converges to the standard scheme of purely imaginary time with time reversal
symmetry in the classical limit of large temperatures.

In this paper, we propose a novel model-free learning method based on
generative adversarial network (GAN) to tackle the JADCE problem. We adopt the
U-net architecture to build the generator rather than the standard GAN
architecture, where a pre-estimated value that contains the activity
information is adopted as input to the generator. By leveraging the properties
of the pseudoinverse, the generator is refined by using an affine projection
and a skip connection to ensure the output of the generator is consistent with
the measurement. Moreover, we build a two-layer fully-connected neural network
to design pilot matrix for reducing the impact of receiver noise. Simulation
results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in high
SNR regimes, as both data consistency projection and pilot matrix optimization
improve the learning ability.

  https://youtu.be/dc58WyWX-z4",,,,"physics.hist-ph gr-qc hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A crucial step in the history of General Relativity was Einstein's adoption
of the principle of general covariance which demands a coordinate independent
formulation for our spacetime theories. General covariance helps us to
disentangle a theory's substantive content from its merely representational
artifacts. It is an indispensable tool for a modern understanding of spacetime
theories. Motivated by quantum gravity, one may wish to extend these notions to
quantum spacetime theories (whatever those are). Relatedly, one might want to
extend these notions to discrete spacetime theories (i.e., lattice theories).
This paper delivers such an extension with surprising consequences.
  One's first intuition regarding discrete spacetime theories may be that they
introduce a great deal of fixed background structure (i.e., a lattice) and
thereby limit our theory's possible symmetries down to those which preserve
this fixed structure (i.e., discrete symmetries). However, as I will discuss,
these intuitions are doubly wrong and overhasty. Discrete spacetime theories
can and do have continuous translation and rotation symmetries. Moreover, the
exact same theory can be given a wide variety of lattice structures and can
even be described with no lattice at all. As my discrete analog of general
covariance will reveal: lattice structure is rather less like a fixed
background structure or part of an underlying manifold and rather more like a
coordinate system, i.e., merely a representational artifact. Thus, the world
cannot be ""fundamentally set on a square lattice"" (or any other lattice) any
more than it could be ""fundamentally set in a certain coordinate system"". Like
coordinate systems, lattice structures are just not the sort of thing that can
be fundamental; they are both thoroughly representational. Spacetime cannot be
discrete (even when it might be representable as such).

the possibility of accessing the full archive of all historic Tweets. In this

two questions. First, are the datasets collected with the Academic API
complete? Secondly, since Twitter's Academic API delivers historic Tweets as
represented on Twitter at the time of data collection, we need to understand
how much data is lost over time due to Tweet and account removal from the
platform. Our work shows evidence that Twitter's Academic API can indeed create
(almost) complete samples of Twitter data based on a wide variety of search
terms. We also provide evidence that Twitter's data endpoint v2 delivers better
samples than the previously used endpoint v1.1. Furthermore, collecting Tweets
with the Academic API at the time of studying a phenomenon rather than creating
local archives of stored Tweets, allows for a straightforward way of following
Twitter's developer agreement. Finally, we will also discuss technical
artifacts and implications of the Academic API. We hope that our work can add
another layer of understanding of Twitter data collections leading to more
reliable studies of human behavior via social media data.

Algarve region of the southern Portugal are presented. This area of interest
has a couple of features that complicate the application of the dispersive wave
model: (1) the area has a complex irregular geometry with a number of barrier
islands that separate the lagoon from the Atlantic Ocean, artificial and
naturally occurring tidal inlets, and a number of curling channels inside the
lagoon that interconnect the inlets and serve as waterways between the lagoon
settlements; (2) the tidal range in the area can reach up to 3.5 m; therefore,
the terrain inside the lagoon is characterized by vast salt marshes and tidal
flats, and the wetting-drying process is a key component of any hydrodynamic
simulation in this area. A model representation of the area has been developed
by generating an unstructured finite element mesh of the circulation cell, and
collecting data on parameters that characterize the tidal waves in the area,
and bottom friction and sediment transport models used in the simulations. The
results of the simulations indicate that the dispersive wave model can be
applied in coastal areas with nontrivial underlying physical processes, and
complex irregular geometries. Moreover, the dispersive term of the model is
capable of capturing additional flow characteristics that are otherwise not
present in hydrodynamic simulations that involve the nonlinear shallow water
equations; and these additional flow features can, in their turn, affect the
resulting sediment transport and bed morphodynamic process simulations.

property-based pattern selection, producing large and highly redundant NSPs,
nonactionable for business decision-making. This work makes the first attempt
for actionable NSP discovery. It builds an NSP graph representation, quantify
both explicit occurrence and implicit non-occurrence-based element and pattern
relations, and then discover significant, diverse and informative NSPs in the
NSP graph to represent the entire NSP set for discovering actionable NSPs. A
DPP-based NSP representation and actionable NSP discovery method EINSP
introduces novel and significant contributions for NSA and sequence analysis:
(1) it represents NSPs by a determinantal point process (DPP) based graph; (2)
it quantifies actionable NSPs in terms of their statistical significance,
diversity, and strength of explicit/implicit element/pattern relations; and (3)
it models and measures both explicit and implicit element/pattern relations in
the DPP-based NSP graph to represent direct and indirect couplings between NSP
items, elements and patterns. We substantially analyze the effectiveness of
EINSP in terms of various theoretical and empirical aspects including
complexity, item/pattern coverage, pattern size and diversity, implicit pattern
relation strength, and data factors.

life. Previously, stress levels were determined by speaking with people and
gaining insight into what they had experienced recently or in the past.
Typically, stress is caused by an incidence that occurred a long time ago, but
sometimes it is triggered by unknown factors. This is a challenging and complex
task, but recent research advances have provided numerous opportunities to
automate it. The fundamental features of most of these techniques are electro
dermal activity (EDA) and heart rate values (HRV). We utilized an accelerometer
to measure body motions to solve this challenge. The proposed novel method
employs a test that measures a subject's electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin
values (GSV), HRV values, and body movements in order to provide a low-cost and
time-saving solution for detecting stress lifestyle disease in modern times
using cyber physical systems. This study provides a new hybrid model for
lifestyle disease classification that decreases execution time while picking
the best collection of characteristics and increases classification accuracy.
The developed approach is capable of dealing with the class imbalance problem
by using WESAD (wearable stress and affect dataset) dataset. The new model uses
the Grid search (GS) method to select an optimized set of hyper parameters, and
it uses a combination of the Correlation coefficient based Recursive feature
elimination (CoC-RFE) method for optimal feature selection and gradient
boosting as an estimator to classify the dataset, which achieves high accuracy
and helps to provide smart, accurate, and high-quality healthcare systems. To
demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed methodology, its
performance is compared to those of other well-established machine learning
models.

charged particles being emitted from the Sun, are an uncontrollable threat to
modern technology. Notably, they have the potential to damage satellites and
cause instability in power grids on Earth, among other disasters. They result
from high sun activity, which are induced from cool areas on the Sun known as
sunspots. Forecasting the storms to prevent disasters requires an understanding
of how and when they will occur. However, current prediction methods at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are limited in that they
depend on expensive solar wind spacecraft and a global-scale magnetometer
sensor network. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning and
computer vision approach to accurately forecast geomagnetic storms without the
need of such costly physical measurements. Our approach extracts features from
images of the Sun to establish correlations between sunspots and geomagnetic
storm classification and is competitive with NOAA's predictions. Indeed, our
prediction achieves a 76% storm classification accuracy. This paper serves as
an existence proof that machine learning and computer vision techniques provide
an effective means for augmenting and improving existing geomagnetic storm
forecasting methods.

crucial role in deciding which items to recommend next. Despite that, recent
works in sequential and time-aware recommendations usually either ignore both
aspects or only consider one of them, limiting their predictive performance. In
this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a context and
attribute-aware recommender model (CARCA) that can capture the dynamic nature
of the user profiles in terms of contextual features and item attributes via
dedicated multi-head self-attention blocks that extract profile-level features
and predicting item scores. Also, unlike many of the current state-of-the-art
sequential item recommendation approaches that use a simple dot-product between
the most recent item's latent features and the target items embeddings for
scoring, CARCA uses cross-attention between all profile items and the target
items to predict their final scores. This cross-attention allows CARCA to
harness the correlation between old and recent items in the user profile and
their influence on deciding which item to recommend next. Experiments on four
real-world recommender system datasets show that the proposed model
significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the task of item
recommendation and achieving improvements of up to 53% in Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Hit-Ratio. Results also show that CARCA outperformed
several state-of-the-art dedicated image-based recommender systems by merely
utilizing image attributes extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 in a black-box

facilitating users to locate their most desired information. However, it is
inherently challenging since it needs to capture semantic information from
short and ambiguous queries and often requires massive task-specific labeled
data. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have advanced various
natural language processing tasks because they can extract general semantic
information from large-scale corpora. Therefore, there are unprecedented
opportunities to adopt PLMs for query understanding. However, there is a gap
between the goal of query understanding and existing pre-training strategies --
the goal of query understanding is to boost search performance while existing
strategies rarely consider this goal. Thus, directly applying them to query
understanding is sub-optimal. On the other hand, search logs contain user
clicks between queries and urls that provide rich users' search behavioral
information on queries beyond their content. Therefore, in this paper, we aim
to fill this gap by exploring search logs. In particular, to incorporate search
logs into pre-training, we first construct a query graph where nodes are
queries and two queries are connected if they lead to clicks on the same urls.
Then we propose a novel graph-enhanced pre-training framework, GE-BERT, which
can leverage both query content and the query graph. In other words, GE-BERT
can capture both the semantic information and the users' search behavioral
information of queries. Extensive experiments on various query understanding
tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In this paper, we present a novel framework allowing us to retrieve the

authority regulation of drone use on public open and green spaces, finding that
many local authorities are unaware of the issues being created through: (i)
inappropriately couched or poorly framed byelaws; (ii) multiple byelaws
covering the same area by virtue of overlapping jurisdictions; or (iii) the
lack readily identifiable policies for drone use on public land.
Overregulation, inconsistent regulation and regulatory disharmony are causing
confusion for recreational drone enthusiasts such that it is never clear which
public or crown-owned open and green spaces they are allowed to, or prohibited
from, flying. While the government and local authorities might like them to,
drones are not going away. Therefore, we conclude, the easiest way to ensure
citizens stay within the bounds of drone law that is intended to ensure public
safety, is to make that law comprehensible, consistent and easy to comply with.
