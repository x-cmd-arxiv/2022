recent developments have skyrocketed the potential applications of deep
learning. Urology, specifically, is one field of medicine that is primed for
the adoption of a real-time image segmentation system with the long-term aim of
automating endoscopic stone treatment. In this project, we explored supervised
deep learning models to annotate kidney stones in surgical endoscopic video
feeds. In this paper, we describe how we built a dataset from the raw videos
and how we developed a pipeline to automate as much of the process as possible.
For the segmentation task, we adapted and analyzed three baseline deep learning
models -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DenseNet -- to predict annotations on the frames
of the endoscopic videos with the highest accuracy above 90\%. To show clinical
potential for real-time use, we also confirmed that our best trained model can
accurately annotate new videos at 30 frames per second. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method justifies continued development and study of image
segmentation to annotate ureteroscopic video feeds.

$\mathbb{Z}_N$ states that for any couple of functions
$f,g\in\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}_N)\setminus\{0\}$, the short-time Fourier transform
$V_g f$ has support of cardinality at least $N$. This result can be regarded as
a time-frequency version of the celebrated Donoho-Stark uncertainty principle
on $\mathbb{Z}_N$. Unlike the Donoho-Stark principle, however, a complete
identification of the extremals is still missing. In this note we provide an
answer to this problem by proving that the support of $V_g f$ has cardinality
$N$ if and only if it is a coset of a subgroup of order $N$ of
$\mathbb{Z}_N\times \mathbb{Z}_N$. Also, we completely identify the
corresponding extremal functions $f,g$. Besides translations and modulations,
the symmetries of the problem are encoded by certain metaplectic operators
associated with elements of ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_{N/a})$, where $a$ is a
divisor of $N$. Partial generalizations are given to finite Abelian groups.

core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is a powerful technique to quantify total dust
mass formed in the ejecta at late times ($>5$ years after outburst) when ejecta
dust temperatures become too low to be detected by mid-IR instruments.
Following our success in using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code DAMOCLES
to measure the dust mass evolution in SN~1987A and other CCSNe, we present the
most comprehensive sample of dust mass measurements yet made with DAMOCLES, for
CCSNe aged between four and sixty years after outburst. Our sample comprises of
multi-epoch late-time optical spectra taken with the Gemini GMOS and VLT
X-Shooter spectrographs, supplemented by archival spectra. For the fourteen
CCSNe that we have modelled, we confirm a dust mass growth with time that can
be fit by a sigmoid curve which is found to saturate beyond an age of $\sim30$
years, at a mass of 0.23$^{+0.17}_{-0.12}$ M$_\odot$. An expanded sample
including dust masses found in the literature for a further eleven CCSNe and
six CCSN remnants, the dust mass at saturation is found to be
0.42$^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$~M$_\odot$. Uncertainty limits for our dust masses were
determined from a Bayesian analysis using the affine invariant Markov Chain
Monte Carlo ensemble sampler emcee with DAMOCLES. The best-fitting line profile
models for our sample all required grain radii between 0.1 and 0.5 $\mu$m. Our
results are consistent with CCSNe forming enough dust in their ejecta to
significantly contribute to the dust budget of the Universe.

utilizes sliced Wasserstein distance to maximize the retention of location

probabilistic aspects. Finally, two software solutions have been developed,
enabling an easy use of the trained models and standardized generation of
clinical reports: Raidionics and Raidionics-Slicer. Segmentation performances
were quite homogeneous across the four different brain tumor types, with an
average true positive Dice ranging between 80% and 90%, patient-wise recall
between 88% and 98%, and patient-wise precision around 95%. With our Raidionics
software, running on a desktop computer with CPU support, tumor segmentation
can be performed in 16 to 54 seconds depending on the dimensions of the MRI
volume. For the generation of a standardized clinical report, including the
tumor segmentation and features computation, 5 to 15 minutes are necessary. All
trained models have been made open-access together with the source code for
both software solutions and validation metrics computation. In the future, an
automatic classification of the brain tumor type would be necessary to replace
manual user input. Finally, the inclusion of post-operative segmentation in

this study, we irradiated HPHT diamonds with an initial nitrogen concentration

longitudinal and transversal relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. From these

annealing steps to quantify the impact of processing at 1100 $^{\circ}$C, which
follows initial annealing at 800 $^{\circ}$C. By tripling the implantation dose
we have increased the magnetic sensitivity of our sensors by $28\pm5$ %. By
projecting our results to higher implantation doses we show that a further
improvement of up to 70 % may be achieved. At the same time, additional

Ross","Symbolic synthesis of Clifford circuits and beyond","12 pages + appendix, comments welcome!",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Path sums are a convenient symbolic formalism for quantum operations with
applications to the simulation, optimization, and verification of quantum
protocols. Unlike quantum circuits, path sums are not limited to unitary
operations, but can express arbitrary linear ones. Two problems, therefore,
naturally arise in the study of path sums: the unitarity problem and the
extraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding whether a given path
sum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of constructing a
quantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary operator.
  We show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general, but that it is
in P when restricted to Clifford path sums. We then provide an algorithm to
synthesize a Clifford circuit from a unitary Clifford path sum. The circuits
produced by our extraction algorithm are of the form $C_1HC_2$, where $C_1$ and
$C_2$ are Hadamard-free circuits and $H$ is a layer of Hadamard gates. We also
provide a heuristic generalization of our extraction algorithm to arbitrary
path sums. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to succeed, it often succeeds
and typically produces natural looking circuits. Alongside applications to the
optimization and decompilation of quantum circuits, we demonstrate the
capability of our algorithm by synthesizing the standard quantum Fourier

study rotational features in deformed nuclei. However, the model uses a
constant angular velocity. To investigate the effect of a dynamic angular
velocity, a quantal microscopic time-reversal and D2 invariant cranking model
for triaxial rotation (MSCRM3) including residual correction terms is derived
from a unitary transformation of the nuclear Schrodinger equation and using
Hartree-Fock approach. Except for the angular velocity and residual terms,
MSCRM3 and the conventional cranking model for triaxial rotation (CCRM3)
Schrodinger equations are identical in form, and are solved iteratively in a
similar manner. The article identifies the differences in the rotational
features predicted by CCRM3 and MSCRM3 for 20Ne, 24Mg, and 28Si using a
self-consistent deformed harmonic-oscillator potential. The rotational features
studied are: rotational relaxation of the intrinsic system, stability of the
rotational states, various rotation modes, nuclear shapes, their transitions,
and band termination. MSCRM3 predicts the observed reduced energy-level spacing
in 20Ne between J=6 and 8 and attributes its occurrence to quenching of a
wobbly rotation. The remaining discrepancy between the observed and
MSCRM3-predicted excitation energies for 20Ne is removed by including the
spin-orbit interaction and the residuals of the square of the angular momentum
and interaction. CCRM3 does not predict the three dimensional phenomena
predicted by MSCRM3 (such as the reduced energy-level spacing in 20Ne and the
rotational-band termination at J=12 in prolate 28Si and triaxial 24Mg, etc.
arising from the angular velocity). We, therefore, conclude that CCRM3 is
effectively a uniaxial rotation model. Therefore, using CCRM3 or its uniaxial
version, one would miss capturing three-dimensional rotation phenomena.

The vibrational amplitude of the sapphire detector device is measured by an

reducing the detection sensitivity. A new detector shape for the detector

years. This also includes the analysis of large, high dimensional networks with
hundreds and thousands of nodes. While Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)
serve as workhorse for network data analyses, their applicability to very large
networks is problematic via classical inference such as maximum likelihood or
fully Bayesian estimation due to scaling and instability issues. The latter
trace from the fact, that classical network statistics consider nodes as
exchangeable, i.e. actors in the network are assumed to be homogeneous. This is
often questionable and one way to circumvent the restrictive assumption is to
include actor specific random effects which account for unobservable
heterogeneity. This in turn however increases the number of unknowns
considerably making the model highly-parameterized. As a solution even for very
large networks we propose a scalable approach based on variational
approximations, which not only leads to numerically stable estimation but is
also applicable to high-dimensional directed as well as undirected networks. We
furthermore show that including node specific covariates can reduce node
heterogeneity which we facilitate through versatile prior formulations. We
demonstrate the procedure in two complex examples, namely Facebook data and

silicate-rich layers (compressed and uncompressed ones resulting from the
compaction process. We develop an inverse problem algorithm to determine the
layout distribution by combining a Finite Element Model approach that accounts
for density variations and constrains pressure-based crushing conditions. The
results show that given the crushing limit of 10 MPa the smallest core size
likely reaches 72 km in radius, and the silicate-rich layer, consisting of both
compressed and uncompressed regions, has a thickness ranging up to 68 km. To
support the localized metal concentration at the crater-like region detected in
the recent radar observation, we give more constraints on the minimum core size

addresses that the ferrovolcanic surface eruptions could still be a source of
metal-rich materials. Finally, while the differentiated structure having a

infers that the core and compressed layer conditions likely control the surface

after the discovery of dark energy. This paper confirms this idea by means of
another well-established theory in general relativity, the embedding of curved
spacetimes in higher-dimensional flat spacetimes: an $n$-dimensional Riemannian
space is said to be of embedding class $m$ if $m+n$ is the lowest dimension of
the flat space in which the given space can be embedded; here
$m=\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$. So a four-dimensional Riemannian space is of class two
and can therefore be embedded in a six-dimensional flat space. A line element
of class two can be reduced to a line element of class one by a suitable
coordinate transformation. The extra dimension can be either spacelike or
timelike, leading to accelerating and decelerating expansions, respectively.
Accordingly, it is proposed in this paper that the free parameter occurring in
the transformation be a periodic function of time. The result is a mathematical
model that can be interpreted as a periodic change in the signature of the
embedding space. This signature change may be the best model for an oscillating
Universe and complements various models proposed in the literature.

  We also consider the class of $k$-ary instances where $k$ is a constant,
i.e., each agent has at most $k$ different values for the goods. We show that
for such instances an EF1+fPO allocation can be computed in strongly polynomial

instances can be computed in strongly polynomial time. Next, we consider
instances where the number of agents is constant, and show that an EF1+PO (also
EQ1+PO) allocation can be computed in polynomial time. These results
significantly extend the polynomial-time computability beyond the known cases
of binary or identical valuations.
  Further, we show that the problem of computing an EF1+PO allocation

gained increased attention for their performance in solving these types of

algorithm with a selected surrogate model that approximates the computationally
expensive function. In this paper, we propose a surrogate model based on a
Lipschitz underestimation and use it to develop a differential evolution-based
algorithm. The algorithm, called Lipschitz Surrogate-assisted Differential
Evolution (LSADE), utilizes the Lipschitz-based surrogate model, along with a
standard radial basis function surrogate model and a local search procedure.
The experimental results on seven benchmark functions of dimensions 30, 50,

with the state-of-the-art algorithms under a limited computational budget,
being especially effective for the very complicated benchmark functions in high

non-ohmic transport regimes have been discovered across a range of materials,

the delafossite metals, determining their nature has proved to be challenging.
Here, we report on a new approach to the problem, employing broadband microwave

differences, which go as far as differing power laws, take advantage of the
hexagonal symmetry of PdCoO$_{2}$. This permits a particularly elegant

favouring ballistic over strictly hydrodynamic flow. Furthermore, it uncovers a
new effect for ballistic electron flow, owing to the highly facetted shape of
the hexagonal Fermi surface. We combine our extensive dataset with an analysis

play a fundamental role in the description of the proximate non-Fermi liquid

$\mathrm{O}(3)$ spin-fermion model. Despite many efforts, a definitive

numerically study the $\mathrm{O}(3)$ spin-fermion model and extract the

observe provides good evidence that the universal scaling is actually governed
by the analytically tractable fixed point discovered near perfect ``hot-spot'""
nesting, even for a larger nesting window. Our predictions can be directly
tested with neutron scattering. Additionally, the HMC method we introduce is

task. In the previous attempt of (Sealfon 2016}, by adding Laplace noise to
each edge weight or to each output distance, to achieve DP with some fixed
budget, with high probability the maximal absolute error among all published
pairwise distances is roughly $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes. It was
shown that this error could be reduced for some special graphs, which, however,
is hard for general graphs. Therefore, whether the approximation error can be
reduced to sublinear in $n$ is posted as an interesting open problem.
  We break the linear barrier on the distance approximation error of previous
result, by proposing an algorithm that releases a constructed synthetic graph
privately. Computing all pairwise distances on the constructed graph only
introduces $\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ error in answering all pairwise shortest path
distances for fixed privacy parameter. Our method is based on a novel graph
diameter (link length) augmentation via constructing ""shortcuts"" for the paths.
By adding a set of shortcut edges to the original graph, we show that any node
pair has a shortest path with link length $\tilde O(n^{1/2})$. Then by adding
noises with some positive mean to the edge weights, we show that the new graph
is differentially private and can be published to answer all pairwise shortest
path distances with $\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ approximation error using standard APSP
computation.
  Additionally, we consider the graph with small feedback vertex set number. A
feedback vertex set (FVS) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves
a graph without cycles, and the feedback vertex set number of a graph, $k$, is
the size of a smallest feedback vertex set. We propose a DP algorithm with
error rate $\tilde O(k)$.

our airspace safe. Over the past decade, the FAA has supported the development
of a new family of collision avoidance systems called the Airborne Collision
Avoidance System X (ACAS X), which model the collision avoidance problem as a
Markov decision process (MDP). Variants of ACAS X have been created for both
manned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu). The variants
primarily differ in the types of collision avoidance maneuvers they issue. For
example, ACAS Xa issues vertical collision avoidance advisories, while ACAS Xu
and ACAS sXu allow for horizontal advisories due to reduced aircraft
performance capabilities. Currently, a new variant of ACAS X, called ACAS Xr,
is being developed to provide collision avoidance capability to rotorcraft and
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. Due to the desire to minimize deviation
from the prescribed flight path of these aircraft, speed adjustments have been
proposed as a potential collision avoidance maneuver for aircraft using ACAS
Xr. In this work, we investigate the effect of speed change advisories on the
safety and operational efficiency of collision avoidance systems. We develop an
MDP-based collision avoidance logic that issues speed advisories and compare
its performance to that of horizontal and vertical logics through Monte Carlo
simulation on existing airspace encounter models. Our results show that while
speed advisories are able to reduce collision risk, they are neither as safe
nor as efficient as their horizontal and vertical counterparts.

  theory: a focused review",,,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  As we enter the era of quantum technologies, quantum estimation theory
provides an operationally motivating framework for determining high precision
devices in modern technological applications. The aim of any estimation process
is to extract information from an unknown parameter embedded in a physical
system such as the estimation converges to the true value of the parameter.
According to the Cram\'er-Rao inequality in mathematical statistics, the Fisher
information in the case of single-parameter estimation procedures, and the
Fisher information matrix in the case of multi-parameter estimation, are the
key quantities representing the ultimate precision of the parameters specifying
a given statistical model. In quantum estimation strategies, it is usually
difficult to derive the analytical expressions of such quantities in a given
quantum state. This review provides comprehensive techniques on the analytical
calculation of the quantum Fisher information as well as the quantum Fisher
information matrix in various scenarios and via several methods. Furthermore,
it provides a mathematical transition from classical to quantum estimation
theory applied to many freedom quantum systems. To clarify these results, we
examine these developments using some examples. Other challenges, including
their links to quantum correlations and saturating the quantum Cram\'er-Rao
bound, are also addressed.

Propulsion Vehicle-mounted camera system to capture data for the 3D-modelling
of this collapsed arch via photogrammetry. We demonstrate use of this method to
document complex underwater geomorphology spread across a large area, and draw
up a geomorphic assessment of the site and collapse event on the basis of this
3D-model. The methodology enables a reconstruction and understanding of the
collapse event. On account of the high-resolution attained, we are able to
cross-match the principal submerged components with their pre-collapse
location; this enables an understanding of the dynamics of the collapse,
confirmation of rock break-up along existing joints, and mapping the
distribution of the rock and debris from the collapse event. We conclude that
the key stages in the collapse of the Azure Window entailed erosion at the base
of the pillar, leading to the latter's collapse in the southwest direction,
breaking into two main sections that separated along the lithological boundary.
We also find clear evidence that separation of some sections of the pillar
followed pre-existing joints. The bridge collapsed vertically upon loss of
support from the pillar, breaking into two main components and many other
fragments. We also document further changes at the site post-collapse. We show
that this approach can be utilised to understand and characterise such events
even when significant time has elapsed since collapse, and rocks have already
undergone erosion and significant marine growth.

be used to encode simple sequences that one would not expect to form in nature.
In this Letter we build four multi-resonant planetary systems and test their

artificial migration forces. We evaluated the stability of each system over the
full 10 Gyr integration of the Sun's main sequence phase. We then tested the
stability of these systems for an additional 10 Gyr, during and after post-main
sequence evolution of the central stars (assumed to be Sun-like) to their
final, white dwarf phase. The only system that was destabilized was the
consecutive integer sequence (system i). The other three sequences therefore
represent potential SETI beacons.

that while relatively better performance is often observed when languages are
more equally sampled, the downstream performance is more robust to language
imbalance than we usually expected. Two features, UNK rate and closeness to the

can form planetesimals from mm grains inside axisymmetric pressure bumps. We
conducted the largest simulation of the SI so far (7 million CPU hours),
consisting of a large slice of the disk with mm grains, a solar-like
dust-to-gas ratio ($Z = 0.01$), and the largest pressure bump that does not
cause gravitational instability (GI) in the particle layer. We used a high
resolution of $1000/H$ to resolve as many SI unstable modes as possible. The
simulation produced a long-lived particle over-density far exceeding the SI
criteria (i.e., a critical solid abundance to headwind parameter ratio $Z/\Pi$)
where strong clumping would occur if these conditions were present over an
extended region of the disk; yet we observed none. The likely reason is that
the time it takes particles to cross the high-$Z/\Pi$ region ($t_{\rm cross}$)
is shorter than the growth timescale of the SI ($t_{\rm grow}$). We propose an
added criterion for planetesimal formation by the SI -- that $t_{\rm cross} >
t_{\rm grow}$. We show that any bump larger than the one in this run would form
planetesimals by the GI instead of the SI. Our results significantly restrict
the pathways to planet formation: Either protoplanetary disks regularly form
grains larger than 1~mm, or planetesimals do not form by the SI in axisymmetric
pressure bumps. Since bumps large enough to induce the GI are likely
Rossby-wave unstable, we propose that mm grains may only form planetesimals in
vortices.

directly adopting automatically generated speech transcripts with highly noisy

effectively ingests cross-modal information to achieve fine-grained

evaluate the capacity of SCQA systems in a dialogue-style interaction, we
assemble a Spoken Conversational Question Answering (Spoken-CoQA) dataset with
more than 40k question-answer pairs from 4k conversations. The performance of
the existing state-of-the-art methods significantly degrade on our dataset,

F-theory compactifications. Of particular importance to phenomenology are the
Quadrillion F-theory Standard Models (F-theory QSMs). In this work, we analyze
a superset of the physical root bundles whose cohomologies encode the
vector-like spectra for the matter representations $(\mathbf{3},
\mathbf{2})_{1/6}$, $(\mathbf{\overline{3}}, \mathbf{1})_{-2/3}$ and
$(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{1})_{1}$. For the family $B_3( \Delta_4^\circ )$
consisting of $\mathcal{O}(10^{11})$ F-theory QSM geometries, we argue that
more than $99.995\%$ of the roots in this superset have no vector-like exotics.
This indicates that absence of vector-like exotics in those representations is
a very likely scenario.
  The QSM geometries come in families of toric 3-folds $B_3( \Delta^\circ )$
obtained from triangulations of certain 3-dimensional polytopes $\Delta^\circ$.
The matter curves in $X_\Sigma \in B_3( \Delta^\circ )$ can be deformed to
nodal curves which are the same for all spaces in $B_3( \Delta^\circ )$.
Therefore, one can probe the vector-like spectra on the entire family $B_3(
\Delta^\circ )$ from studies of a few nodal curves. We compute the cohomologies
of all limit roots on these nodal curves.
  In our applications, for the majority of limit roots the cohomologies are
determined by line bundle cohomology on rational tree-like curves. For this, we
present a computer algorithm. The remaining limit roots, corresponding to
circuit-like graphs, are handled by hand. The cohomologies are independent of
the relative position of the nodes, except for a few circuits. On these
\emph{jumping circuits}, line bundle cohomologies can jump if nodes are
specially aligned. This mirrors classical Brill-Noether jumps. $B_3(
\Delta_4^\circ )$ admits a jumping circuit, but the root bundle constraints
pick the canonical bundle and no jump happens.

However, defining the main characteristics, width and length of those structure

We estimated the surface stellar density of arms and inter-arm regions to

(M83). We find that field stellar populations can trace the (two) main spiral
arms of NGC 5236. We find a correlation between the arm width and the
galactocentric radii, found using other tracers. The slope of the growth of the
width of the arm correlates with the morphological types of spiral galaxies. A
second finding of our study suggest the possible correlation between the width

APOGEE-2 and Gaia surveys to obtain the full 6-dimensional measurements of
positions and velocities of young stars in these regions. The velocity
structure functions (VSFs) of the stars show a universal scaling of turbulence.
We also obtain H{\alpha} gas kinematics in these four regions from the
Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper. The VSFs of the H{\alpha} are more diverse compared
to the stars. In regions with recent supernova activities, they show
characteristics of local energy injections and higher amplitudes compared to
the VSFs of stars and of CO from the literature. Such difference in amplitude
of the VSFs can be explained by the different energy and momentum transport
from supernovae into different phases of the ISM, thus resulting in higher
levels of turbulence in the warm ionized phase traced by H{\alpha}. In regions
without recent supernova activities, the VSFs of young stars, H{\alpha}, and CO
are generally consistent, indicating well-coupled turbulence between different
phases. Within individual regions, the brighter parts of the H{\alpha} gas tend
to have a higher level of turbulence than the low-emission parts. Our findings
support a complex picture of the Milky Way ISM, where turbulence can be driven

we systematically classify inflationary three-point correlators of scalar
perturbations using the bootstrap method. For the first time, we derive a
complete set of single-exchange cosmological collider bispectra with new shapes
and potentially detectable signals. Specifically, we focus on the primordial
scalar bispectra generated from the exchange of massive particles with all
possible boost-breaking interactions during inflation. We introduce three-point
""seed"" functions, from which we bootstrap the inflationary bispectra of scalar
and spinning exchanges using weight-shifting and spin-raising operators. The
computation of the seed function requires solving an ordinary differential
equation in comoving momenta, a boundary version of the equation of motion
satisfied by a propagator that linearly mixes a massive particle with the
external light scalars. The resulting correlators are presented in analytic
form, for any kinematics. These shapes are of interest for near-future
cosmological surveys, as the primordial non-Gaussianity in boost-breaking
theories can be large. We also identify new features in these shapes, which are
phenomenologically distinct from the de Sitter invariant cases. For example,
the oscillatory shapes around the squeezed limit have different phases.
Furthermore, when the massive particle has much lower speed of sound than the
inflaton, oscillatory features appear around the equilateral configuration.

material at such a high rate that it undergoes thermonuclear runaways every 1 -
100 years. They are the only class of novae in which the white dwarf can grow
in mass, making some of these systems strong Type Ia supernova progenitor
candidates. Almost all known recurrent novae are long-period (P_orb > 12 hrs)
binary systems in which the requisite mass supply rate can be provided by an
evolved (sub-)giant donor star. However, at least two recurrent novae are
short-period (P_orb < 3 hrs) binaries in which mass transfer would normally be
driven by gravitational radiation at rates 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than
required. Here, we show that the prototype of this class -- T Pyxidis -- has a
distant proper motion companion and therefore likely evolved from a
hierarchical triple star system. Triple evolution can naturally produce exotic
compact binaries as a result of three-body dynamics, either by Kozai-Lidov
eccentricity cycles in dynamically stable systems or via mass-loss-induced
dynamical instabilities. By numerically evolving triple progenitors with
physically reasonable parameters forward in time, we show explicitly that the
inner binary can become so eccentric that mass transfer is triggered at
periastron, driving the secondary out of thermal equilibrium. We suggest that
short-period recurrent novae likely evolved via this extreme state, explaining
their departure from standard binary evolution tracks.

to the halo masses of galaxies in our control sample, especially in the
innermost cluster-centric radial bin ($0.1<r<0.3$ [$h^{-1}\rm Mpc$]). For the

ion with predictions from analytical models of CGM : precipitation (PP) and
isothermal (IT) model. For a CGM in hydrostatic equilibrium, the introduction
of CR suppresses thermal pressure, and affects the OVIII ion abundance. We
explore the allowances given to the ratio of CR pressure to thermal pressure
($\rm{P}_{\rm{CR}}/\rm{P}_{\rm{th}}=\eta$), with varying boundary conditions,
CGM mass content, photoionization by extragalactic ultraviolet background and
temperature fluctuations. We find that the allowed maximum values of $\eta$ are
: $\eta\lesssim10$ in the PP model and $\eta\lesssim6$ in the IT model. We also
explore the spatial variation of $\eta$ : rising ($\eta=Ax$) or declining
($\eta=A/x$) with radius, where A is the normalization of the profiles. In
particular, the models with declining ratio of CR to thermal pressure fare
better than those with rising ratio with suitable temperature fluctuation
(larger $\sigma_{\rm ln T}$ for PP and lower for IT). The declining profiles
allow $A\lesssim8$ and $A\lesssim10$ in the case of IT and PP models,
respectively, thereby accommodating a large value of $\eta \,(\simeq 200)$ in
the central region, but not in the outer regions. These limits, combined with
the limits derived from $\gamma$-ray and radio background, can be useful for
building models of Milky Way CGM including CR population. However, the larger
amount of CR can be packed in cold phase which may be one way to circumvent
these constraints.

already exist at the epoch of Reionisation, when the Universe was 0.5-1 Gyr
old. These objects likely reside in over-dense regions of the Universe, and
will grow to form today's giant galaxies. How their huge black holes formed in
such short times is debated, particularly as they lie above the local black
hole mass-galaxy dynamical mass correlation, thus following the black
hole-dominance growth path. It is unknown what slowed down the black hole
growth, leading towards the symbiotic growth observed in the local Universe,
and when this process started, although black hole feedback is a likely driver.
This deadlock is due to the lack of large, homogeneous samples of high-redshift
quasars with high-quality, broad-band spectroscopic information. Here we report
results from a VLT/X-shooter survey of 30 quasars at redshift 5.8$\le$z$\le$6.6
(XQR-30). About 50% of their spectra reveal broad blue-shifted absorption line
(BAL) throughs, tracing powerful ionised winds. The BAL fraction in z$\gtrsim$6
quasars is 2-3 times higher than in quasars at z~2-4.5. XQR-30 BAL quasars
exhibit extreme outflow velocities, up to 17% of the light speed, rarely
observed at lower redshift. These outflows inject large amounts of energy into
the galaxy interstellar medium, which can contrast nuclear gas accretion,
slowing down the black-hole growth. The star-formation rate in high-z quasar
hosts is generally $>$100 M$_\odot$/yr, so these galaxies are growing at a fast
rate. The BAL phase may then mark the beginning of significant feedback, acting
first on black hole growth and possibly later on galaxy growth. The red optical
colors of BAL quasars at z$\gtrsim$6 indeed suggest that these systems are
dusty and may be caught during an initial quenching phase of obscured
accretion.

distributions of galactic NSs, we find that CGW signals from a few ($\sim 0-6$)
neutron stars should be strongly lensed. Lensing will produce two copies of the
signal (with time delays of seconds to minutes) that will interfere with each
other. The relative motion of the NS with respect to the lensing optical axis
will change the interference pattern, which will help us to identify a lensed
signal. Accounting for the magnifications and time delays of the lensed
signals, we investigate their detectability by ground-based detectors.
Modelling the spin distribution of NSs based on that of known pulsars and
assuming an ellipticity of $\epsilon = 10^{-7}$, lensed CGWs are unlikely to be
detectable by LIGO and Virgo in realistic searches involving
$\mathcal{O}(10^{12})$ templates. However, third generation detectors have a
$\sim 2-51\%$ probability of detecting at least one lensed CGW signal. For an

connection at higher genus. We prove that the higher-genus partition functions
take the form of polynomials of higher-weight theta functions, and that the
higher-genus modular group acts as simple linear transformations on these
polynomials. We explain how to solve the modular constraints explicitly, which
we do for genus 2. The result is that modular invariance at genus 1 and genus 2
is much more constraining than genus 1 alone. This allows us to drastically
reduce the space of possible code CFTs. We also consider a number of examples
of ""isospectral theories"" -- CFTs with the same genus 1 partition function --
and we find that they have different genus 2 partition functions. Finally, we
make connection to some 2d CFTs known from the modular bootstrap. The $n = 4$
theory conjectured to have the largest possible gap, the $SO(8)$ WZW model, is
a code CFT, allowing us to give an expression for its genus 2 partition
function. We also find some other known CFTs which are not code theories but
whose partition functions satisfy the same simple polynomial ansatz as the code
theories. This leads us to speculate about the usefulness of the code
polynomial form beyond the study of code CFTs.

to address the lack of clarity in terminology in genomics have largely focused
on ontologies that acknowledge the difference between genetic ancestry and

subjective discretization of people, normalized by historical racial
categories; this perpetuates exclusion at the expense of inclusion. In order to
make the benefits of genomics research accessible to all, standards around

challenge when the potential energy landscape is characterized by a large
number of local minima separated by high barriers. The principal observation of
this work is that the multiple local minima and energy barriers in a landscape
can often occur as a result of discrete symmetries in the potential energy
function. A new Monte Carlo method is proposed, group action Markov chain Monte
Carlo (GA-MCMC), which augments more conventional trial moves (e.g. random
jumps, hybrid Monte Carlo, etc.) with the application of a group action from a
well-chosen generating set of the discrete symmetry group; the result is a
framework for symmetry-adapted MCMC. It is shown that conventional trial moves
are generally optimal for ""local mixing"" rates, i.e. sampling a single energy
well; whereas the group action portion of the GA-MCMC trial move allows the
Markov chain to propagate between energy wells and can vastly improve the rate
of ""global mixing"". The proposed method is compared with standard jumps and
umbrella sampling (a popular alternative for energy landscapes with barriers)
for potential energies with translational, reflection, and rotational
symmetries. GA-MCMC is shown to consistently outperform the considered
alternatives, even when the symmetry of the potential energy function is
broken. The work culminates by extending GA-MCMC to a clustering-type algorithm
for interacting dielectric polymer chains. Not only does GA-MCMC again
outperform the considered alternatives, but it is the only method which
consistently converges for all of the cases considered. Some new and
interesting phenomena regarding the electro-elasticity of dielectric polymer
chains, unveiled via GA-MCMC, is briefly discussed.

in a continually updating environment. In this paper, we explore the
consequences of this inherent lack of self-awareness towards impairing the

superposition-based adjacency matrix. Here, our method leverages an induced

the performance of the individual rewrites in a bi-variate beta setting. We
also surface a data augmentation strategy that leverages template-based

validity of the stopping power theory in physics, which predicts a decrease of
the velocity $V(t)$ of the point charge given by $\dot{V} \sim -|V|^{-3} V$, a
formula that goes back to Bohr (1915). Our result holds for all initial
velocities larger than a threshold value that is larger than the velocity of
all background particles and remains valid until (i) the particle slows down to
the threshold velocity, or (ii) the time is exponentially long compared to the
velocity of the point charge. The long-time behavior of this coupled system is
related to the question of Landau damping which has remained open in this
setting so far. Contrary to other results in nonlinear Landau damping, the
long-time behavior of the system is driven by the non-trivial electric field of
the plasma, and the damping only occurs in regions that the point charge has
already passed.

transfer modelling with archival measures of molecular gas and black hole mass.
The ratios of stellar mass, molecular gas mass, and black hole mass to each
other are consistent with those of massive gas-rich galaxies at z<0.3. The
advanced mergers may show increased black hole mass to stellar mass ratios,
consistent with the transition from AGN to ellipticals and implying substantial
black hole mass growth over the course of the merger. Star formation rates are
enhanced relative to the local main sequence, by factors of ~100 in the
starburst and ~1.8 in the host. The starburst star formation rates appear
distinct to star formation in the main sequence at all redshifts up to at least
z~5. Starbursts may prefer late-stage mergers, but are observed at any merger
stage. We do not find evidence that the starbursts in these low-redshift
systems substantially increase the total stellar mass, with a soft upper limit
on the stellar mass increase from starburst activity of about a factor of two.
In contrast, 12 objects show evidence for super-Eddington accretion, associated
with late-stage mergers, suggesting that many AGN in infrared-luminous mergers
go through a super-Eddington phase. The super-Eddington phase may increase
black hole mass by up to an order of magnitude at an accretion efficiency of
42+/-33% over a period of 44+/-22Myr. Our results imply that super-Eddington
accretion is an important black hole growth channel in infrared-luminous

primaries exhibit a wide range of stellar obliquities. On the other hand, hot
Jupiter systems with low-mass, cool primaries often have stellar obliquities
close to zero. Efficient tidal interactions between hot Jupiters and the
convective envelopes present in lower-mass main sequence stars have been a
popular explanation for these observations. If this explanation is accurate,
then aligned systems should be older than misaligned systems. Likewise, the
convective envelope mass of a hot Jupiter's host star should be an effective
predictor of its obliquity. We derive homogeneous stellar parameters --
including convective envelope masses -- for hot Jupiter host stars with
high-quality sky-projected obliquity inferences. Using a thin disk stellar
population's Galactic velocity dispersion as a relative age proxy, we find that
hot Jupiter host stars with larger-than-median obliquities are older than hot
Jupiter host stars with smaller-than-median obliquities. The relative age
difference between the two populations is larger for hot Jupiter host stars
with smaller-than-median fractional convective envelope masses and is
significant at the 3.6-$\sigma$ level. We identify stellar mass, not convective
envelope mass, as the best predictor of stellar obliquity in hot Jupiter
systems. The best explanation for these observations is that many hot Jupiters
in misaligned systems arrived in the close proximity of their host stars long
after their parent protoplanetary disks dissipated. The dependence of observed
age offset on convective envelope mass suggests that tidal realignment
contributes to the population of aligned hot Jupiters orbiting stars with
convective envelopes.

landscape composed of spatially uncorrelated or autocorrelated environmental
patches, where two species with the same competitive strategies, not able to
coexist without some form of phenotypic plasticity, expanded their ranges in
the absence of a competition-colonization trade-off (a well-studied mechanism
for species diversity). Each patch is characterized by a random environmental
value that determines the optimal phenotype of its occupants. In such a
scenario, only local adaptation and gene flow (migration) may interact to
promote genetic variation and coexistence in the metapopulation. Results show
that a competitively inferior species with adaptive phenotypic plasticity can

Traditional models of such interactions assume a constant interaction strength
between a given pair of species. However, there is often significant trait
variation among individual organisms even within the same species, causing
heterogeneity in their interaction strengths with other species. The
consequences of such heterogeneous interactions for the ecosystem have not been
studied systematically. As a theoretical exploration, we analyze a simple
ecosystem with trophic interactions between two predators and a shared prey,
which would exhibit competitive exclusion in models with homogeneous
interactions. We consider several scenarios where individuals of the prey
species differentiate into subpopulations with different interaction strengths.
We show that in all these cases, whether the heterogeneity is inherent,
reversible, or adaptive, the ecosystem can stabilize at a new equilibrium where
all three species coexist. Moreover, the prey population that has heterogeneous
interactions with its predators reaches a higher density than it would without
heterogeneity, and can even reach a higher density in the presence of two
predators than with just one. Our results suggest that heterogeneity may be a
naturally selected feature of ecological interactions that have important
consequences for the stability and diversity of ecosystems.

fundamentally bypass traditional DoS mitigation schemes based on the flow and
volume of network packets. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach,
called ROKI, that accurately tracks internal resource utilization and
allocation associated with each packet (or session), making it possible to tame
resource exhaustion caused by {\mu}DoS attacks. Since ROKI focuses on capturing
the symptom of DoS, it can effectively mitigate previously unknown {\mu}DoS
attacks. To enable a finer-grain resource tracking, ROKI provided in concept
the accounting capabilities to each packet itself, so we called data-driven: it
monitors resource utilization at the link, network, transport layers in the
kernel, as well as application layers, and attributes back to the associated
packet. Given the resource usages of each packet, ROKI can reclaim (or prevent)
the system resources from malicious packets (or attackers) whenever it
encounters system-wide resource exhaustion. To provide lightweight resource
tracking, ROKI carefully multiplexes hardware performance counters whenever
necessary. Our evaluation shows that ROKI's approach is indeed effective in
mitigating real-world {\mu}DoS attacks with negligible performance overheads -
incurring 3%-4% throughput and latency overheads on average when the system is
throttled.

we propose a fully autonomous pipeline for quantifying TKA kinematics from
single-plane imaging. First, a convolutional neural network segments the
femoral and tibial implants from the image. Second, segmented images are
compared to Normalized Fourier Descriptor shape libraries for initial pose
estimates. Lastly, a Lipschitzian optimization routine minimizes the difference
between the segmented image and the projected implant. This technique reliably
reproduces human-supervised kinematics measurements from internal datasets and
external validation studies, with RMS differences of less than 0.7mm and
4{\deg} for internal studies and 0.8mm and 1.7{\deg} for external validation
studies. This performance indicates that it will soon be practical to perform
these measurements in a clinical setting.

reduction version of SMD (VRSMD) can further improve SMD by inducing faster
convergence. On the other hand, algorithms such as gradient descent and
stochastic gradient descent have the implicit regularization property that
leads to better performance in terms of the generalization errors. Little is
known on whether such a property holds for VRSMD. We prove here that the
discrete VRSMD estimator sequence converges to the minimum mirror interpolant

been in part possible thanks to the continuous development of high-resolution,
stable spectrographs, and using the Doppler radial-velocity (RV) method. The
Cross Correlation Function (CCF) method is one of the traditional approaches
for RV extraction. More recently, template matching was introduced as an
advantageous alternative for M-dwarf stars. In this paper, we describe a new
implementation of template matching within a semi-Bayesian framework, providing
a more statistically principled characterization of the RV measurements. In
this context, a common RV shift is used to describe the difference between each
spectral order of a given stellar spectrum and a template built from the
available observations. Posterior probability distributions are obtained for
the relative RV associated with each spectrum, after marginalizing with respect
to the continuum. This methodology was named S-BART: Semi-Bayesian Approach for
RVs with Template-matching, and it can be applied to HARPS and ESPRESSO. The
application of our method to HARPS archival observations of Barnard's star
allowed us to validate our implementation against HARPS-TERRA and SERVAL. Then,
we applied it to 33 ESPRESSO targets, evaluating its performance and comparing
it with the CCF method. We found a decrease in the median RV scatter of \sim
10\% and \sim 4\% for M- and K-type stars, respectively. S-BART yields more
precise RV estimates than the CCF method, particularly in the case of M-type
stars where a median uncertainty of \sim 15 cm/s is achieved over 309
observations. Further, we estimated the nightly zero point (NZP) of ESPRESSO,
finding a weighted NZP scatter below \sim 0.7 m/s. As this includes stellar
variability, photon noise, and potential planetary signals, it should be taken
as an upper limit of the RV precision attainable with ESPRESSO data.

real-life scenarios (social network accounts which are not maintained forever,
collaboration networks in which people retire, technological networks in which

clues reveal a plethora of information about what happens in a scene, make the
audio-visual space an intuitive choice for representation learning. In this
paper, we explore the efficacy of audio-visual self-supervised learning from
uncurated long-form content i.e movies. Studying its differences with
conventional short-form content, we identify a non-i.i.d distribution of data,
driven by the nature of movies. Specifically, we find long-form content to
naturally contain a diverse set of semantic concepts (semantic diversity),
where a large portion of them, such as main characters and environments often
reappear frequently throughout the movie (reoccurring semantic concepts). In
addition, movies often contain content-exclusive artistic artifacts, such as
color palettes or thematic music, which are strong signals for uniquely
distinguishing a movie (non-semantic consistency). Capitalizing on these
observations, we comprehensively study the effect of emphasizing within-movie
negative sampling in a contrastive learning setup. Our view is different from
those of prior works who consider within-video positive sampling, inspired by
the notion of semantic persistency over time, and operate in a short-video
regime. Our empirical findings suggest that, with certain modifications,
training on uncurated long-form videos yields representations which transfer
competitively with the state-of-the-art to a variety of action recognition and

visibility of interference fringes and the path distinguishability. Here, we
use quantum information-theoretic tools to derive quantifiers of these two

a more accurate joint regressor, we propose a method to create

providing an enumeration algorithm that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(1.9896^n)$,
using polynomial space only. The key to this result is the consideration of
this enumeration problem on 2-degenerate graphs, which is proven to be possible
in time $\mathcal{O}(1.9767^n)$. We also show new lower bound results by
constructing a family of graphs of order $n$ with $\Omega(1.4890^n)$ minimal
connected dominating sets, while previous examples achieved $\Omega(1.4422^n)$.
Our construction results in lower bounds for a few special graph classes.
  We also address essential questions concerning output-sensitive enumeration.
Namely, we give reasons why our algorithm cannot be turned into an enumeration
algorithm that guarantees polynomial delay without much efforts. More
precisely, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide, given a graph $G$ and a
vertex set $U$, if there exists a minimal connected dominating set $D$ with
$U\subseteq D$, even if $G$ is known to be 2-degenerate. Our reduction also
shows that even any subexponential delay is not easy to achieve for enumerating
minimal connected dominating sets. Another reduction shows that no
FPT-algorithms can be expected for this extension problem concerning minimal
connected dominating sets, parameterized by $|U|$. We also relate our
enumeration problem to the famous open Hitting Set Transversal problem, which
can be phrased in our context as the question to enumerate all minimal
dominating sets of a graph with polynomial delay by showing that a
polynomial-delay enumeration algorithm for minimal connected dominating sets

reflection for incident plane waves. However, the periodic arrangement of the
unit cells leads to coherent constructive and destructive interference in the
scattered field in some directions which is undesirable for achieving acoustic
diffusivity. The spatial uniformity of acoustic energy scattered from
conventional diffusers constructed in this way is a fundamental limitation of
the traditional approach which is not easily overcome when one wishes to cover
large reflecting surfaces. In this work, we investigate spatiotemporal
modulation of the surface acoustic admittance of an acoustic diffuser as a new
approach to improve the sound diffusion. We develop a semi-analytical model
that employs Fourier series expansion to determine the scattered sound field
from a surface admittance consisting of a quadratic residue diffuser (QRD)
design whose individual well admittances are modulated with a traveling wave
with modulation frequency, $\omega_{\mrm{m}}$, amplitude, $Y_\mrm{m}$, and a
wavenumber that matches the unit cell length, $\Lambda$. We observe significant
improvement in diffusion performance due to the fact that the spatiotemporal
modulation scatters sound into additional frequency--wavenumber pairs

mainly due to the fact that multiple criteria need to be considered. A standard
way to proceed is with benefit risk analysis, often under the Bayesian paradigm
to account for uncertainty and combine data with expert judgement, which is
operationalised via multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) scores. The
procedure is based on a suitable model to accommodate key features of the data,
which are typically of mixed type and potentially depended, with factor models
providing a standard choice. The contribution of this paper is threefold:
first, we extend the family of existing structured factor models. Second, we
provide a framework for choosing between them, which combines fit and
out-of-sample predictive performance. Third, we present a sequential estimation
framework that can offer multiple benefits: (i) it allows us to efficiently
re-estimate MCDA scores of different drugs each time new data become available,
thus getting an idea on potential fluctuations in differences between them,
(ii) it can provide information on potential early stopping in cases of evident
conclusions, thus reducing unnecessary further exposure to undesirable
treatments; (iii) it can potentially allow to assign treatment groups
dynamically based on research objectives. A drawback of sequential estimation
is the increased computational time, but this can be mitigated by efficient
sequential Monte Carlo schemes which we tailor in this paper to the context of
Bayesian benefit risk analysis. The developed methodology is illustrated on
real data on Type II diabetes patients who were administered Metformin (MET),

interacting electron systems, which is a challenging task on conventional
computers. It uses a continued fraction representation based on the Lanczos
method, where the wave functions are expanded as linear combination of basis
states within a quantum subspace. While on conventional computers the cost of
the computation grows exponentially with system size, limiting the method to
small systems, by representing the basis states on a quantum computer one may
overcome this exponential scaling barrier. We propose a two-level multigrid
Trotter time evolution for an efficient preparation of the basis states in a
quantum circuit, which takes advantage of the robustness of the subspace
expansion against Trotter errors. Using a quantum emulator we demonstrate the
algorithm for the Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice with infinite coordination,
which we map to a 16 qubit Anderson impurity model within the dynamical mean
field theory. Our algorithm computes the Green's function accurately for both
the metallic and Mott insulating regimes, with a circuit depth several orders
of magnitude below what has been proposed using time evolution. The two-level
multigrid time evolution reduces the number of Trotter steps required to
compute the Green's function to about four to six. We therefore expect that the
method can be used on near term quantum computers for moderate system sizes,

through a detailed dynamic model involving nonlinear differential and algebraic
equations whose solution process is computationally expensive. This has
prohibited adoption of such models for cascading failure simulation. To solve
this, we propose a fast cascading failure simulation approach based on implicit
Backward Euler method (BEM) with stiff decay property. Unfortunately, BEM
suffers from hyperstability issue in case of oscillatory instability and
converges to the unstable equilibrium. We propose a predictor-corrector
approach to fully address the hyperstability issue in BEM. The predictor
identifies oscillatory instability based on eigendecomposition of the system
matrix at the post-disturbance unstable equilibrium obtained as a byproduct of
BEM. The corrector uses right eigenvectors to identify the group of machines
participating in the unstable mode. This helps in applying appropriate
protection schemes as in ground truth. We use Trapezoidal method (TM)-based
simulation as the benchmark to validate the results of the proposed approach on
the IEEE 118-bus network, 2,383-bus Polish grid, and IEEE 68-bus system. The
proposed approach is able to track the cascade path and replicate the end
results of TM-based simulation with very high accuracy while reducing the
average simulation time by approximately 10-35 fold. The proposed approach was
also compared with the partitioned method, which led to similar conclusions.

crucial. The adiabatic representation is appealing since adiabatic states are
readily available from quantum chemistry packages. The nuclear wavepackets are
then expanded in a basis of Gaussian functions, which follow trajectories to
explore the potential energy surfaces and approximate the potential using a
local expansion of the adiabatic quantities. Nevertheless, the adiabatic
representation is plagued with severe limitations when conical intersections
are involved: the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (DBOCs) are
non-integrable, and the geometric phase effect on the nuclear wavepackets
cannot be accounted for unless a model is available. To circumvent these
difficulties, the moving crude adiabatic (MCA) representation was proposed and
successfully tested in low energy dynamics where the wavepacket skirts the
conical intersection. We assess the MCA representation in the case of
non-adiabatic transitions through conical intersections. First, we show that
using a Gaussian basis in the adiabatic representation indeed exhibits the

good magnetocrystalline anisotropy (0.31meV) contributed by the in-plane

($-$8%<$\varepsilon$<8%) can effectively tune the magnetic moments of V atom,
valley splitting $\Delta$E, T$_{c}$ and MAE of Janus 2H-VSeS monolayer. The
corresponding $\Delta$E and T$_{c}$ are adjusted from 72meV to 106.8meV and
from 180K to 340K, respectively. The electronic phase transition from bipolar
magnetic semiconductor (BMS) to half-semiconductor (HSC), spin gapless

the opposite valley charge carriers carry opposite Berry curvature, which leads
to prominent anomalous Hall conductivity at the K and K$^{\prime}$ valleys. The

to the transmitted messages, and entangles with robust stochastic gradient
aggregation to defend against Byzantine attacks. In this paper, we decouple the
two issues via robust stochastic model aggregation, in the sense that our
proposed DP mechanisms and the defense against Byzantine attacks have separated
influence on the learning performance. Leveraging robust stochastic model
aggregation, at each iteration, each worker calculates the difference between
the local model and the global one, followed by sending the element-wise signs
to the master node, which enables robustness to Byzantine attacks. Further, we
design two DP mechanisms to perturb the uploaded signs for the purpose of
privacy preservation, and prove that they are $(\epsilon,0)$-DP by exploiting
the properties of noise distributions. With the tools of Moreau envelop and
proximal point projection, we establish the convergence of the proposed

laboratory to explore the formation of populous clusters. We report multiscale
ALMA observations of the N159W-North clump, which is the most CO-intense region
in the galaxy. High-resolution CO isotope and 1.3 mm continuum observations
with an angular resolution of $\sim$0.""25($\sim$0.07 pc) revealed more than
five protostellar sources with CO outflows within the main ridge clump. One of
the thermal continuum sources, MMS-2, shows especially massive/dense nature
whose total H$_2$ mass and peak column density are $\sim$10$^{4}$ $M_{\odot}$
and $\sim$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, and harbors massive ($\sim$100
$M_{\odot}$) starless core candidates identified as its internal substructures.
The main ridge containing this source can be categorized as one of the most
massive protocluster systems in the Local Group. The CO high-resolution
observations found several distinct filamentary clouds extending southward from
the star-forming spots. The CO (1-0) data set with a larger field of view
reveals a conical-shaped, $\sim$30 pc long complex extending toward the
northern direction. These features indicate that a large-scale gas compression
event may have produced the massive star-forming complex. Based on the striking
similarity between the N159W-North complex and the previously reported other
two high-mass star-forming clouds in the nearby regions, we propose a
$""$teardrops inflow model$""$ that explains the synchronized, extreme star
formation across $>$50 pc, including one of the most massive protocluster

demonstrate numerically that an easier way to implement an alternative phase

that a better alignment of the low energy subspace of the alternative operator

  It is particularly important to optimize fine-grain DVFS mechanisms for

Fulfilling this goal requires both that the explanations generated by these

While the former has been addressed in prior work, the latter is often
overlooked, resulting in informal model understanding derived from a handful of
local explanations. In this paper, we introduce explanation summary (ExSum), a
mathematical framework for quantifying model understanding, and propose metrics

al. for reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution, 3D non-Cartesian
acquisitions by incorporating motion compensation into these reconstructions
using an approach termed MoCo-MSLR. Methods: Motion compensation is challenging
to incorporate into high spatiotemporal resolution reconstruction due to the
memory footprint of the motion fields and the potential to lose dynamics by
relying on an initial high temporal resolution, low spatial resolution
reconstruction. Motivated by the work of Ong Et al. and Huttinga Et al., we
estimate low spatial resolution motion fields through a loss enforced in
k-space and represent these motion fields in a memory efficient manner using
multi-scale low rank components. We interpolate these motion fields to the
desired spatial resolution, and then incorporate these fields into Extreme MRI.
Results: MoCo-MSLR was able to improve image quality for reconstructions around
500ms temporal resolution and capture bulk motion not seen in Extreme MRI.
Further, MoCo-MSLR was able to resolve realistic cardiac dynamics at near 100ms
temporal resolution while Extreme MRI struggled to resolve these dynamics.
Conclusion: MoCo-MSLR improved image quality over Extreme MRI and was able to
resolve both respiratory and cardiac motion in 3D.

NOT want. Naturally, one might expect video retrieval to support
natural-language queries with negation, e.g., finding shots of kids sitting on
the floor and not playing with a dog. However, the state-of-the-art deep
learning based video retrieval models lack such ability, as they are typically
trained on video description datasets such as MSR-VTT and VATEX that lack
negated descriptions. Their retrieved results basically ignore the negator in
the sample query, incorrectly returning videos showing kids playing with dog.
This paper presents the first study on learning to understand negation in video
retrieval and make contributions as follows. By re-purposing two existing
datasets (MSR-VTT and VATEX), we propose a new evaluation protocol for video
retrieval with negation. We propose a learning based method for training a
negation-aware video retrieval model. The key idea is to first construct a soft
negative caption for a specific training video by partially negating its
original caption, and then compute a bidirectionally constrained loss on the
triplet. This auxiliary loss is weightedly added to a standard retrieval loss.
Experiments on the re-purposed benchmarks show that re-training the CLIP
(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) model by the proposed method clearly
improves its ability to handle queries with negation. In addition, the model
performance on the original benchmarks is also improved.

contaminant sources is a challenging task due to their ill-posed and non-unique
nature. Numerous works have focused on determining nonlinear physical processes
through model selection methods. However, identifying corresponding nonlinear
systems for different physical phenomena using numerical methods can be
computationally prohibitive. With the advent of machine learning (ML)
algorithms, more efficient surrogate models based on neural networks (NNs) have
been developed in various disciplines. In this work, a theory-guided U-net
(TgU-net) framework is proposed for surrogate modeling of three-dimensional
(3D) groundwater contaminant problems in order to efficiently elucidate their
involved processes and unknown parameters. In TgU-net, the underlying governing
equations are embedded into the loss function of U-net as soft constraints. For
the considered groundwater contaminant problem, sorption is considered to be a
potential process of an uncertain type, and three equilibrium sorption isotherm
types (i.e., linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir) are considered. Different from
traditional approaches in which one model corresponds to one equation, these
three sorption types are modeled through only one TgU-net surrogate. The three
mentioned sorption terms are integrated into one equation by assigning
indicators. Accurate predictions illustrate the satisfactory generalizability
and extrapolability of the constructed TgU-net. Furthermore, based on the
constructed TgU-net surrogate, a data assimilation method is employed to
identify the physical process and parameters simultaneously. This work shows
the possibility of governing equation discovery of physical problems that
contain multiple and even uncertain processes by using deep learning and data
assimilation methods.

directly from observations in the upper solar atmosphere, including the
chromosphere and corona. Radio observations are regarded as the most feasible
approach to diagnose the magnetic field in solar chromosphere and corona.
However, because of the complexity and diversity of the emission mechanisms,
the previous studies have only presented the implicit diagnostic functions of
the magnetic field for specific mechanism from solar radio observations. This
work collected and sorted out all methods for diagnosing coronal magnetic field
from solar radio observations, which are expressed as a set of explicit
diagnostic functions. In particular, this work supplemented some important
diagnostic methods missed in other reviews. This set of diagnostic functions
can completely cover all regions of the solar chromosphere and corona,
including the quiet region, active region and flaring source regions. At the
same time, it also includes incoherent radiation such as bremsstrahlung
emission of thermal plasma above the quiet region, cyclotron and
gyro-synchrotron emissions of magnetized hot plasma and mildly relativistic
nonthermal electrons above the active regions, as well as coherently plasma
emission around flaring source regions. Using this set of diagnostic functions
and the related broadband spectral solar radio imaging observations, we can
derive the magnetic fields of almost all regions in the solar atmosphere,which
may help us to make full use of the spectral imaging observations of the new

coupled through their edges, which allows to split the populations to generate
superpositions of spin excitations in different spin chains. We show that due
to the topological protection, the quantum superpositions can be transported
through the array against the effect of disorder. This approach will open a new

allow them to operate in complex, high dimensional, non-linear, and dynamically
changing environments. Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN
classifiers may output misclassifications as they experience tasks in their
operational environments, that were not identified during development. Removing
a system from operation and retraining it to include these new tasks becomes
economically infeasible as the number of such ASs increases. Additionally, such
misclassifications may cause financial loss and safety threats to the AS or to
other operators in the environment. In this paper, we propose to reduce such
threats by investigating how DNN classifiers can adapt their knowledge to learn
new information in the AS's operational environment, using only a limited
number of observations encountered sequentially during operation. This allows
the AS to adapt to newly encountered information, increasing the AS's
classification accuracy and hence its overall reliability. However, retraining
DNNs on different observations than used in prior training is known to cause
catastrophic forgetting or significant model drift. We investigate how this
problem can be controlled by using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) whilst
learning from limited new observations. We carry out experiments using original
and noisy versions of the MNIST dataset to represent known and new information
to DNN classifiers. Results show that using EWC is effective in controlling the
process of adaptation to new information, and thus allows for reliable adaption
of ASs to new information in their operational environment.

  analysis for safety assurance",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid advancement of Formal Methods, Model-based Safety Analysis
(MBSA) has been gaining tremendous attention for its ability to rigorously
verify whether the safety-critical scenarios are adequately addressed by the
design solution of a cyber-physical human system. However, there is a gap. If
specific safety-critical scenarios are not included in the given design
solution (i.e., the model) in the first place, the results of MBSA cannot be
trusted for safety assurance. To tackle this problem, we propose a new
safety-guided design methodology (called STPA+) to complement MBSA. Inspired by
STPA, STPA+ treats a system as a control structure, which is particularly fit
for systems with complex interactions between human, machine, and automation.
Three methods are developed in STPA+ to tackle the possible omissions of
safety-critical scenarios caused by incorrectly defined safety constraints,
improperly constrained process model, and inadequately designed controller. In
this way, STPA+ directly derives an adequately defined design solution as the
input to an MBSA verification program and bridges the gap between current MBSA
approaches and safety assurance.

studied extensively in image classification but much less in image

noisy segmentation labels remains limited. We address this deficiency in both
binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and multi-class
segmentation of natural images. We classify segmentation labels according to
their noise transition matrices (NTMs) and compare performance of DNNs trained
by different types of labels. When we randomly sample a small fraction (e.g.,
10%) or flip a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the ground-truth labels to train
DNNs, their segmentation performance remains largely unchanged. This indicates
that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels rather than pixel-level labels per
se in their supervised training for semantic segmentation. We call these hidden
structures meta-structures. When labels with different perturbations to the
meta-structures are used to train DNNs, their performance in feature extraction
and segmentation degrades consistently. In contrast, addition of meta-structure
information substantially improves performance of an unsupervised model in
binary semantic segmentation. We formulate meta-structures mathematically as
spatial density distributions. We show theoretically and experimentally how
this formulation explains key observed learning behavior of DNNs.

derive gauge field configuration which describes the transition between
neighboring vacua, like the instanton (or anti-instanton) solution in QCD, and
the corresponding Euclidean action in two models. In a simplified 2-dimensional
U(1) model, the derived configuration to describe the transition is shown to

however, the gauge field configuration to describe the transition is shown to
have infinite Euclidean action and therefore the tunneling probability between

inconsistency stems from unmanageable randomness and may easily collapse in
specific cases. To render the uncertainty of DE reliable, we propose a
refinement of DE where the functional inconsistency is explicitly

uncertainty imposed, we maximize functional evidence lower bound to make the GP
specified by DE approximate the Bayesian posterior. In this way, we relate DE

occurs at the L8 and T2.5 types, respectively, although ammonia can be
detectable as early as T1.5. Silicate absorption sets in at spectral type L2,
is on average the strongest in L4--L6 dwarfs, and disappears past L8. However,
silicate absorption can also be absent from the spectra at any L subtype. We

variable models. The novelty of the proposed test is that it allows the number
of covariates and/or instruments to be larger than the sample size and is
robust to heteroskedastic errors. We show that the test has the desired
theoretical properties under sparse high-dimensional models and is more
powerful than existing overidentification tests. First, we introduce a test
based on the maximum norm of multiple parameters that could be
high-dimensional. The theoretical power based on the maximum norm is shown to
be higher than that in the modified Cragg-Donald test (Koles\'{a}r, 2018),
which is the only existing test allowing for large-dimensional covariates.
Second, following the principle of power enhancement (Fan et al., 2015), we
introduce the power-enhanced test, with an asymptotically zero component used
to enhance the empirical power against some extreme alternatives with many
locally invalid instruments. Focusing on hypothesis testing, we also provide a
feasible estimator of endogenous effects for practitioners when instrument
validity is not rejected. The simulation results show the superior performance
of the proposed test, and the empirical power enhancement is clear. Finally, an
empirical example of the trade and economic growth nexus demonstrates the
usefulness of the proposed tests.

  Distillation","Accepted by ICME 2022, camera-ready version",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning provides a privacy guarantee for generating good deep
learning models on distributed clients with different kinds of data.
Nevertheless, dealing with non-IID data is one of the most challenging problems
for federated learning. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods to
eliminate the negative influence of non-IIDness. However, they only focus on
the non-IID data provided that the universal class distribution is balanced. In
many real-world applications, the universal class distribution is long-tailed,
which causes the model seriously biased. Therefore, this paper studies the
joint problem of non-IID and long-tailed data in federated learning and
proposes a corresponding solution called Federated Ensemble Distillation with
Imbalance Calibration (FEDIC). To deal with non-IID data, FEDIC uses model
ensemble to take advantage of the diversity of models trained on non-IID data.
Then, a new distillation method with logit adjustment and calibration gating
network is proposed to solve the long-tail problem effectively. We evaluate
FEDIC on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT with a highly non-IID
experimental setting, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods of
federated learning and long-tail learning. Our code is available at

which makes them inapplicable to the cases that original data are not accessed

the distribution of real data, so that the performance degradation is
alleviated. Moreover, we incorporate the diversity enhancement to solve
class-wise mode collapse. We also employ the exponential moving average to
update the centroid of each cluster for further feature distribution
improvement. Extensive experiments based on different deep models (e.g.,

repair techniques leverage context for bug fixes. However, existing techniques
treat context in an arbitrary manner, by extracting code in close proximity of
the buggy statement within the enclosing file, class, or method, without any
analysis to find actual relations with the bug. To reduce noise, they use a
predefined maximum limit on the number of tokens to be used as context. We
present a program slicing-based approach, in which instead of arbitrarily
including code as context, we analyze statements that have a control or data
dependency on the buggy statement. We propose a novel concept called dual
slicing, which leverages the context of both buggy and fixed versions of the
code to capture relevant repair ingredients. We present our technique and tool
called Katana, the first to apply slicing-based context for a program repair
task. The results show Katana effectively preserves sufficient information for
a model to choose contextual information while reducing noise. We compare

systems. Yet, little is known about what models of trust have been used and for
what systems: robots, virtual characters, smart vehicles, decision aids, or
others. Moreover, there is yet no known standard approach to measuring trust in
AI. This scoping review maps out the state of affairs on trust in human-AI
interaction (HAII) from the perspectives of models, measures, and methods.
Findings suggest that trust is an important and multi-faceted topic of study
within HAII contexts. However, most work is under-theorized and under-reported,
generally not using established trust models and missing details about methods,
especially Wizard of Oz. We offer several targets for systematic review work as
well as a research agenda for combining the strengths and addressing the
weaknesses of the current literature.

has been limited by a reliance on the human gender binary model of feminine and

Type-2 AGN in SDSS DR12. Although half of Type-1 AGN do not have measured
$\sigma$ due to unapparent absorption features overwhelmed by AGN activities,
both properties of mean spectra of Type-1 AGN with and without measured
$\sigma$ and positive dependence of $\sigma$ on [O~{\sc iii}] luminosity can
lead to statistically larger $\sigma$ of all the Type-1 AGN than the 6260
Type-1 AGN with measured stellar velocity dispersions. Then, direct $\sigma$
comparisons can lead to statistically larger $\sigma$ in Type-1 AGN, with
confidence level higher than 10sigma, after considering necessary effects of
different redshift and different central AGN activities. Although Type-1 AGN
have $\sigma$ only about $(9\pm3)$\% larger than Type-2 AGN, the difference
cannot be well explained at current stage. Unless there was strong evidence to
support different \msig relations or to support quite different evolution

secret identity messages into the prediction behaviors or the internals (e.g.,
weights and neuron activation) of the target model. Sacrificing less
functionality and involving more knowledge about the target model, the latter
branch of watermarking schemes (i.e., white-box model watermarking) is claimed

  In this paper, we present the first effective removal attack which cracks

protection mechanisms at the granularity of neurons, we for the first time
discover their common dependence on a set of fragile features of a local neuron

almost random. Meanwhile, unlike known removal attacks, our attack requires no
prior knowledge on the training data distribution or the adopted watermark
algorithms, and leaves model functionality intact.

depth distribution of prompt gamma relying on Compton scattered events. A
second approach aims at unambiguously identifying the presence of protons in a
region of interest by introducing a bio-compatible fiducial marker in the
patient and measuring the characteristic prompt gamma of the marker against
background material. A third approach illustrates a novel design for position
sensitive gamma imaging with a millimeter level adjustable position resolution
with a high detection efficiency which is a step towards 3D prompt gamma
imaging, useful to better understand the target composition. Simulations of the

accurately detect equilibrium critical points and universal scaling exponents

by successfully implementing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), where parameters
are distributions rather than deterministic, and applying novel implementations

provides a comprehensive overview of the prediction more suited to
practitioners' needs than predictions from a classical neural network. Using a

and determine if the probability of an outcome is statistically significant. To
enhance trustworthiness, we also spatially apply the two XAI techniques of
Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values. These XAI methods reveal the extent to which the BNN is suitable and/or
trustworthy. Using two techniques gives a more holistic view of BNN skill and
its uncertainty, as LRP considers neural network parameters, whereas SHAP
considers changes to outputs. We verify these techniques using comparison with

first give the expression of secrecy outage probability for any beamforming

measured based on the eavesdropper's statistical CSI. Then, with the aid of the

simplified to reduce computational complexity. Finally, it is demonstrated that

speech enhancement (SE) community, most schemes only pursue the performance in
a black-box manner and lack adequate model interpretability. Inspired by
Taylor's approximation theory, we propose an interpretable decoupling-style SE
framework, which disentangles the complex spectrum recovery into two separate
optimization problems \emph{i.e.}, magnitude and complex residual estimation.
Specifically, serving as the 0th-order term in Taylor's series, a filter
network is delicately devised to suppress the noise component only in the
magnitude domain and obtain a coarse spectrum. To refine the phase
distribution, we estimate the sparse complex residual, which is defined as the
difference between target and coarse spectra, and measures the phase gap. In
this study, we formulate the residual component as the combination of various
high-order Taylor terms and propose a lightweight trainable module to replace
the complicated derivative operator between adjacent terms. Finally, following
Taylor's formula, we can reconstruct the target spectrum by the superimposition
between 0th-order and high-order terms. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance over
previous competing baselines in various evaluation metrics. The source code is

distribution and properties of carbonaceous dust particles are essential to
understanding the physics of the disk. The HD 169142 disk is seen almost
face-on and thus offers a unique opportunity to study the dust radial
evolution. We investigate the spatial distribution and properties of the
carriers of several dust aromatic emission features in the disk across a broad
spatial range (10-200 AU). We analysed imaging and spectroscopic observations
in the 8-12 microns range from VLT/VISIR, as well as adaptive optics
spectroscopic observations in the 3-4 microns range from VLT/NACO. The data
probes the spatial evolution of the 3.3, 8.6, and 11.3 microns aromatic bands.
To constrain the radial distribution of carbonaceous nano-grains, the
observations were compared to models using The Heterogeneous dust Evolution
Model for Interstellar Solids (THEMIS), integrated into the POLARIS radiative
transfer code by calculating the thermal and stochastic heating of
sub-micrometer dust grains. Our data show predominant nano-particle emission at
all radii (resolution of about 0.1"", 12 AU at 3 microns and 0.3"", 35 AU at 10
microns) in the HD 169142 disk. This unambiguously shows that carbonaceous
nano-grains dominate radiatively the infrared spectrum in most of the disk, as
suggested by previous studies. In order to account for both VISIR and NACO
emission maps, we show the need for aromatic particles distributed within the
disk from the outermost regions to a radius of 20 AU, corresponding to the
outer limit of the inner cavity derived from previous observations. In the
inner cavity, these aromatic particles might be present but their abundance
would then be significantly decreased.

Error Correction (CGEC) has gradually received widespread attention and become
a research hotspot. However, one obvious deficiency for the existing CGEC
evaluation system is that the evaluation values are significantly influenced by
the Chinese word segmentation results or different language models. The
evaluation values of the same error correction model can vary considerably
under different word segmentation systems or different language models.
However, it is expected that these metrics should be independent of the word
segmentation results and language models, as they may lead to a lack of
uniqueness and comparability in the evaluation of different methods. To this
end, we propose three novel evaluation metrics for CGEC in two dimensions:
reference-based and reference-less. In terms of the reference-based metric, we
introduce sentence-level accuracy and char-level BLEU to evaluate the corrected
sentences. Besides, in terms of the reference-less metric, we adopt char-level
meaning preservation to measure the semantic preservation degree of the
corrected sentences. We deeply evaluate and analyze the reasonableness and
validity of the three proposed metrics, and we expect them to become a new
standard for CGEC.

relies on a fixed $\alpha$ (e.g., it has limited applicability in testing the

involves redistributing observed prime factors to randomize values in
accordance with a power-law model but without restricting ourselves to

multi-path components (MPCs) in the four scenarios is characterized by the
power-delay-angular profiles. Based on them, the temporal and spatial
consistency for varying receiver locations in the complex hallway and NLoS
scenarios are verified. To characterize, the large-scale best-direction and

this claim, we analyze PN models from the literature, identify the combination

how the semantics of BP, which define how to interweave scenarios into a single

dynamics of the string around the conformal black hole. Depending on the
characteristic parameter of the conformal black hole and the initial position
of the string, there are three kinds of dynamical behaviors: ordered, chaotic
and being captured, chaotic but not being captured. A particular interesting
observation is that there is a sharp transition in chaotic dynamics when the
black hole horizon disappears, which is indepent of the initial position of the
string. It provides a possible way to probe the horizon structure of the
massive body. We also examine the generalized MSS (Maldacena, Shenker and
Stanford) inequality, which is proposed in holographic dual field theory, and
find that the generalized MSS inequality holds even in the asymptotically flat
black hole background. Especially, as the initial position of the string
approaches the black hole horizon, the Lyapunov exponent also approaches the
upper bound of the generalized MSS inequality.

means of three-dimensional, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations modeling
the interaction of the solar wind with the Hermean magnetosphere. This method
allows a self-consistent representation of the plasma dynamics from the large
planetary scale down to the electron kinetic scale. Numerical simulations are
carried out using two different solar wind conditions: purely northward or
purely southward interplanetary magnetic field direction. We find a high plasma
current (of the order of few $\mu$A/m2) flowing at the magnetospheric
boundaries (bow shock and magnetopause) dominated by electrons. This current is
driven by the small-scale electron physics resolved in our model. Furthermore,
we observe strong electron acceleration up to tens of keV as a consequence of
magnetic reconnection when the interplanetary magnetic field is directed
southward. Such energetic electrons are partially trapped in the dipolar
magnetic field of the planet mainly at nightside. Finally, by studying the
distribution of electrons in our simulations along Mariner10 and BepiColombo

signals from sparse retrievers could be combined with those from dense

retrieval effectiveness. In this paper we consider the problem of combining the
relevance signals from sparse and dense retrievers in the context of Pseudo
Relevance Feedback (PRF). This context poses two key challenges: (1) When
should interpolation occur: before, after, or both before and after the PRF
process? (2) Which sparse representation should be considered: a zero-shot
bag-of-words model (BM25), or a learnt sparse representation? To answer these
questions we perform a thorough empirical evaluation considering an effective

(ANCE, TCTv2, DistillBERT), and one state-of-the-art learnt sparse retriever

presence of geometric obstacles such as buildings, objects or vehicles, are
becoming quite popular, due to the increasing availability of digital
environment databases and high-performance computation platforms, such as
multicore computers and cloud computing services. When objects or vehicles are
moving, which is the case of industrial or vehicular environments, multiple
successive representations of the environment (""snapshots"") and multiple ray
tracing runs are often necessary, which require a great human effort and a
great deal of computation resources. Recently, the Dynamic Ray Tracing (DRT)
approach has been proposed to predict the multipath evolution within a given
time lapse on the base of the current multipath geometry, assuming constant
speeds and/or accelerations for moving objects, using analytical extrapolation
formulas. This is done without re-running a full ray tracing for every
""snapshot"" of the environment, therefore with a great computation time saving.
When DRT is embedded in a mobile radio system and used in real-time,
ahead-of-time (or anticipative) field prediction is possible that opens the way
to interesting applications. In the present work, a full-3D DRT algorithm is
presented that allows to account for multiple reflections, edge diffraction and
diffuse scattering for the general case where moving objects can translate and
rotate. For the purpose of validation, the model is first applied to some ideal
cases and then to realistic cases where results are compared with conventional
ray tracing simulation and measurements available in the literature.

magnetic local time. These auroral spots were formed while the
substorm-associated auroral bulge was subsiding and several poleward-elongated
auroral streak-like structures appeared during the late substorm recovery

and positive bays caused by the field-aligned currents related with the aurora
spiral appearance. The negative bays were reflected in the variations of local

10 times greater than the previous models electron emission level. Ionization
efficiency of the EI ion source is proportional to the amount of electron
emission, which implies our new model increased the ionization efficiency 10
times. We conducted performance tests on the prototype with the 3.0 W heating

we conducted endurance tests of the ion source and demonstrated the persistence

Johnstone constructed the first directed complete poset whose Scott space is

complete Heyting algebra whose Scott space is non-sober. Achim Jung then asked
whether every countable complete lattice has a sober Scott space.
  Let $\Sigma P$ be the Scott space of poset $P$. In this paper, we first prove
that the topology of the product space $\Sigma P\times \Sigma Q$ coincides with
the Scott topology on the product poset $P\times Q$ if the set $Id(P)$ and

Based on this result, we deduce that a directed complete poset $P$ has a sober

well-filtered. Thus a complete lattice $L$ with $Id(L)$ countable has a sober
Scott space. Making use the obtained results, we then construct a countable

(EMI) generated by the switching action of power semiconductors can be a
significant challenge for the design of a compact, lightweight vehicle. As
semiconductor switching frequencies increase, e.g., through the introduction of
new materials, such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide, this problem
becomes more severe. We present a control scheme for an automotive dc-to-dc
converter that reduces the EMI generated by shaping switching distortion
predictively at the run time. The multistep model-predictive control scheme
chooses the subsequent switching state that optimizes the output spectrum
according to predefined criteria. To achieve real-time operation, it evaluates
the possible switching state candidates for the next modulation step without
explicitly solving a single Fourier transform. In addition, the switching rate
and voltage ripple are controlled in a single unified control law. We present
and experimentally validate that the control scheme can indeed run at real time
already with currently available mid-range hardware. The results demonstrate
that the largest spectral peak of the switching distortion can be decreased by
48 dB compared to conventional pulse-width modulation. Furthermore, spectral
gaps can be implemented in the output distortion and altered in real-time,
allowing certain frequency bands -- e.g., bands used by other sensitive
electronics such as sensors, communication busses, or tuners -- to be kept free
of EMI from the converter's switching actions.

However, the existing contrastive learning methods are inadequate for

introduces two views on respective guidance of node attributes and graph

distinct but most suitable attribute and topology fusion mechanisms in the two
views, which are conducive to mining relevant information in attributes and
topologies separately. We further use both attribute similarity and topological
correlation to construct high-quality contrastive samples. Extensive
experiments on three large real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the

leveraging imprecise but fast bounding methods on a large number of easier
subproblems. The former can capture complex multi-neuron dependencies but
sacrifices completeness due to the inherent limitations of convex relaxations.
The latter enables complete verification but becomes increasingly ineffective
on larger and more challenging networks. In this work, we present a novel
complete verifier which combines the strengths of both paradigms: it leverages
multi-neuron relaxations to drastically reduce the number of subproblems
generated during the BaB process and an efficient GPU-based dual optimizer to
solve the remaining ones. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
verifier achieves a new state-of-the-art on both established benchmarks as well
as networks with significantly higher accuracy than previously considered. The
latter result (up to 28% certification gains) indicates meaningful progress
towards creating verifiers that can handle practically relevant networks.

of recommendation systems, many of these systems do not take the order of

recommendation, where users generally follow a progressive path towards more
advanced courses. Researchers have used RNNs to build sequential recommendation
systems and other models that deal with sequences. Sequential Recommendation
systems try to predict the next event for the user by reading their history.
With the massive success of Transformers in Natural Language Processing and
their usage of Attention Mechanism to better deal with sequences, there have
been attempts to use this family of models as a base for a new generation of
sequential recommendation systems. In this work, by converting each user's
interactions with items into a series of events and basing our architecture on
Transformers, we try to enable the use of such a model that takes different
types of events into account. Furthermore, by recognizing that some events have
to occur before some other types of events take place, we try to modify the
architecture to reflect this dependency relationship and enhance the model's

shared background knowledge between the transmitter and receiver that includes
empirical data and their associated semantic information. In practice, the
semantic information is defined by the pragmatic task of the receiver and
cannot be known to the transmitter. The actual observable data at the
transmitter can also have non-identical distribution with the empirical data in
the shared background knowledge library. To address these practical issues,
this paper proposes a new neural network-based semantic communication system
for image transmission, where the task is unaware at the transmitter and the
data environment is dynamic. The system consists of two main parts, namely the
semantic coding (SC) network and the data adaptation (DA) network. The SC
network learns how to extract and transmit the semantic information using a
receiver-leading training process. By using the domain adaptation technique
from transfer learning, the DA network learns how to convert the data observed
into a similar form of the empirical data that the SC network can process
without retraining. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method can be
adaptive to observable datasets while keeping high performance in terms of both
data recovery and task execution.

embeddings to locate the target mentioned by the text. However, modeling the
visual features from these predefined locations may fail to fully exploit the
visual context and attribute information in the text query, which limits their
performance. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based framework for

develop a visual-linguistic verification module to focus the visual features on
regions relevant to the textual descriptions while suppressing the unrelated
areas. A language-guided feature encoder is also devised to aggregate the
visual contexts of the target object to improve the object's distinctiveness.
To retrieve the target from the encoded visual features, we further propose a
multi-stage cross-modal decoder to iteratively speculate on the correlations
between the image and text for accurate target localization. Extensive

investigate the angular dependence and ellipticity of dilepton emission. By
comparing the result with the zero-field Born approximation, we find that the
magnetic field leads to a strong enhancement of the dilepton rate at small
values of the invariant mass ($M\lesssim\sqrt{|eB|}$). In the same kinematic
region, the dilepton production is characterized by a sizable ellipticity. At
large values of the dilepton invariant mass ($M\gtrsim\sqrt{|eB|}$), the role
of the magnetic field decreases and the result approaches the isotropic

Answering such queries efficiently is the key to obtain fast $k$-NN

  We show that this is possible using a combination of two data structures. The
first data structure allow us to compute a region containing exactly the
$k$-nearest neighbors of a query point $q$, and the second data structure can
then report the most frequent color in such a region. This leads to linear
space data structures with query times of $O(n^{1 / 2} \log n)$ for points in

characterized by a change of orbital type around a high-symmetry point close to
the Fermi level. In some cases of band inversion in topological insulators, the
existence of quasinodal spheres has been detected, and the change of orbital
type is shown to be concentrated along these spheres in momentum space. To
understand this phenomenon, we develop a local effective fourfold Hamiltonian
that models the band inversion and reproduces the quasinodal sphere. This model
shows that the signal of the spin Hall conductivity, as well as the change of
orbital type, are both localized on the quasinodal sphere, and moreover, that
these two indicators characterize the topological nature of the material. Using
K-theoretical methods, we show that the change of orbital type parametrized by
an odd clutching function is equivalent to the strong Fu-Kane-Mele invariant.
We corroborate these results with ab initio calculations for the materials YH3
and CaTe, where in both cases the signal of the spin Hall conductivity is
localized on the quasinodal spheres in momentum space. We conclude that a
nontrivial spin Hall conductivity localized on the points of change of orbital
type is a good indicator for topological insulation.

are minimal. This paper primarily focuses on building an experimental setup

First, we built a prototype sensor suit embedded with numerous physiological

in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy to learn more about dark matter
(DM) properties. Our focus is on clarifying how dynamical friction (DF) from
the DM halo is modified from the different microscopic properties of DM, which
may alter $both$ the scattering processes responsible of DF and the DM profiles
(in particular generating a core), which also modifies DF. We consider: $(i)$
fermionic degenerate dark matter (DDM), where Pauli blocking should be taken
into account in the dynamical friction computation; $(ii)$ self-interacting
dark matter (SIDM) and $(iii)$ ultralight dark matter (ULDM), for which this
problem has been addressed by a variety of methods in recent literature. We
derive DF with a Fokker-Planck formalism, reproducing previous results for ULDM
and cold DM, while providing new results for DDM. Furthermore, ULDM, DDM and
SIDM may generate cores in dSphs, which suppress dynamical friction and prolong
GC orbits. We conclude that in all these cases the modifications in the DM
modelling does not easily solve the so-called timing `problem' of Fornax GCs.
We finally study this `problem' in terms of the initial conditions,
demonstrating that the observed orbits of Fornax GCs are consistent with this
expectation of a cuspy DM profile with a mild `fine-tuning' at the level of
$\sim25\%$.

Starting from a generalized Ising ring model, we investigate the error
propagation formula of the central spin and it indicates that Heisenberg
scaling can be reached while the probe state only needs to be a product state.
Particularly, we derive an analytical form of the dynamic quantum Fisher
information in a limit case, which explicitly exhibits the Heisenberg scaling.
By comparing with numerical results, we demonstrate that the general case can
be well approximated by the analytical result when the coupling strength among
the surrounding spins is much weaker than the coupling strength between the
central and surrounding spins. This analytic result guides us to find the
appropriate probe state and the proper measurement time, to achieve the
Heisenberg scaling in realistic situations. Furthermore, we investigate various
effects which are important in practical quantum systems, including the central
spin Zeeman term, the anisotropy of the hyperfine interaction and the
inhomogeneity of the hyperfine coupling strength. Our result indicates that the
dynamic quantum-enhanced sensing scheme seems feasible in realistic quantum
central spin systems, like semiconductor quantum dots.

facial thermography dataset. This article makes two main contributions to the
body of knowledge. First, it presents a comprehensive review and comparison of
current public datasets in facial thermography. Second, it introduces and
studies a novel public dataset on facial thermography, which we call it
Charlotte-ThermalFace. Charlotte-ThermalFace contains more than10000 infrared
thermal images in varying thermal conditions, several distances from the
camera, and different head positions. The data is fully annotated with the
facial landmarks, ambient temperature, relative humidity, the air speed of the
room, distance to the camera, and subject thermal sensation at the time of
capturing each image. Our dataset is the first publicly available thermal
dataset annotated with the thermal sensation of each subject in different
thermal conditions and one of the few datasets in raw 16-bit format. Finally,
we present a preliminary analysis of the dataset to show the applicability and
importance of the thermal conditions in facial thermography. The full dataset,
including annotations, are freely available for research purpose at

perturbation of the input in a black box setting by making multiple calls to

approaches unusable. This work seeks to improve the One-pixel (few-pixel)
black-box adversarial attacks to reduce the number of calls to the network
under attack. The One-pixel attack uses a non-gradient optimization algorithm
to find pixel-level perturbations under the constraint of a fixed number of
pixels, which causes the network to predict the wrong label for a given image.
We show through experimental results how the choice of the optimization

increase attack success significantly, making the attack more practical in

limited in their ability to identify risk for post-operative mortality. We
hypothesize that electrocardiograms contain hidden risk markers that can help
prognosticate post-operative mortality. Methods. In a derivation cohort of
45,969 pre-operative patients (age 59+- 19 years, 55 percent women), a deep
learning algorithm was developed to leverage waveform signals from
pre-operative ECGs to discriminate post-operative mortality. Model performance
was assessed in a holdout internal test dataset and in two external hospital
cohorts and compared with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score. Results.
In the derivation cohort, there were 1,452 deaths. The algorithm discriminates
mortality with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) surpassing the discrimination
of the RCRI score with an AUC of 0.67 (CI 0.61-0.72) in the held out test
cohort. Patients determined to be high risk by the deep learning model's risk
prediction had an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 8.83 (5.57-13.20) for
post-operative mortality as compared to an unadjusted OR of 2.08 (CI 0.77-3.50)
for post-operative mortality for RCRI greater than 2. The deep learning
algorithm performed similarly for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with an
AUC of 0.85 (CI 0.77-0.92), non-cardiac surgery with an AUC of 0.83
(0.79-0.88), and catherization or endoscopy suite procedures with an AUC of
0.76 (0.72-0.81). The algorithm similarly discriminated risk for mortality in
two separate external validation cohorts from independent healthcare systems
with AUCs of 0.79 (0.75-0.83) and 0.75 (0.74-0.76) respectively. Conclusion.
The findings demonstrate how a novel deep learning algorithm, applied to
pre-operative ECGs, can improve discrimination of post-operative mortality.

efficiency of the system as well as raise interest to use the system. Feeder
bus service fills the area that is far from the railway system; therefore,
designing a feeder network in a gap area causes the expansion of the main
transit network. Purpose: To present a modified potential demand model for
designing a multi-circulation feeder network. Materials and Methods: In this
study, the potential demand is defined based on the traffic demand of each
section related to each link, the average walking distance of passengers to
specified links, the distance from the links to stations, and finally potential
demand of accessing each main station for each link. A labelling method is used
to create continuous circular and separated routes. After generating an initial
solution using a constructive heuristic algorithm, a genetic algorithm was
operated to solve the problem. In the second algorithm, each route is
considered a gene, and each network is considered a chromosome. In fact, in
this step, different routes from diverse solutions are combined as a unique
feeder network. Tehran District 10 was selected as the case study and the model
was tested on this area which is located near the central business districts. A
machine learning approach has been applied to estimate the missing values of
the related database. Results: By running the algorithm, four feeder routes
were obtained with reasonable travel times and distances of 4.8, 5.5, 5.8, and
8.1 km, starting and ending at the same railway station. Moreover, 98% of the
area was covered by resulted feeder network with a maximum access distance of
300m. Conclusion: What stands out from this method is that the combination of
the modified feeder route design model and algorithms is feasible.

driving scene into vector representations so that the downstream task such as
trajectory prediction could perform well. The driving scene is complicated, and
there exists heterogeneity within elements, where they own diverse types of
information i.e., agent dynamics, map routing, road lines, etc. Meanwhile,
there also exist relativity across elements - meaning they have spatial
relations with each other; such relations should be canonically represented
regarding the relative measurements since the absolute value of the coordinate
is meaningless. Taking these two observations into consideration, we propose a
novel backbone, namely Heterogeneous Driving Graph Transformer (HDGT), which
models the driving scene as a heterogeneous graph with different types of nodes
and edges. For graph construction, each node represents either an agent or a
road element and each edge represents their semantics relations such as
Pedestrian-To-Crosswalk, Lane-To-Left-Lane. As for spatial relation encoding,
instead of setting a fixed global reference, the coordinate information of the
node as well as its in-edges is transformed to the local node-centric
coordinate system. For the aggregation module in the graph neural network
(GNN), we adopt the transformer structure in a hierarchical way to fit the
heterogeneous nature of inputs. Experimental results show that the proposed
method achieves new state-of-the-art on INTERACTION Prediction Challenge and
Waymo Open Motion Challenge, in which we rank 1st and 2nd respectively

network establishes a pyramid architecture by introducing multi-level shortcuts
to directly integrate features in the output module. In addition, a weighted
stacked strategy is proposed to replace the conventional feature fusion method.
The weights of the features are determined based on their levels. These basic
principles are verified, and key network settings are discussed. Subsequently,
the redesigned architectures are compared with other commonly used algorithms.
Results show that the testing mean-square error (MSE) loss of the networks on
