partial differential equations on near-term quantum computers. Here, we propose
a variational quantum algorithm for solving a general evolution equation
through implicit time-stepping of the Laplacian operator. The use of encoded
source states informed by preceding solution vectors results in faster
convergence compared to random re-initialization. Through statevector
simulations of the heat equation, we demonstrate how the time complexity of our
algorithm scales with the ansatz volume for gradient estimation and how the
time-to-solution scales with the diffusion parameter. Our proposed algorithm
extends economically to higher-order time-stepping schemes, such as the
Crank-Nicolson method. We present a semi-implicit scheme for solving systems of
evolution equations with non-linear terms, such as the reaction-diffusion and
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and demonstrate its validity by
proof-of-concept results.

important paradigm to design efficient digital signatures. It has been
leveraged in the Picnic scheme [CDG+ 20] that reached the third round of the
NIST PQC Standardization process. It has also been used in [Beu20] to introduce
the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) with Helper paradigm. This construction permits to
design shorter signatures but induces a non negligible performance overhead as
it uses cut-and-choose. In this paper, we introduce the PoK leveraging
structure paradigm along with its associated challenge space amplification
technique. Our new approach to design PoK brings some improvements over the PoK
with Helper one. Indeed, we show how one can substitute the Helper in these
constructions by leveraging the underlying structure of the considered problem.
This approach does not suffer from the performance overhead inherent to the PoK
with Helper paradigm hence offers different trade-offs between security,
signature sizes and performances. We also present four new post-quantum
signature schemes. The first one is based on a new PoK with Helper for the
Syndrome Decoding problem. It relies on ideas from [BGKM22] and [FJR21] and
improve the latter using a new technique that can be seen as performing some
cut-and-choose with a meet in the middle approach. The three other signatures
are based on our new PoK leveraging structure approach and as such illustrate
its versatility. We provide new PoK related to the Permuted Kernel Problem
(PKP), Syndrome Decoding (SD) problem and Rank Syndrome Decoding (RSD) problem.
In practice, these PoK lead to comparable or shorter signatures than existing
ones. Indeed, considering (public key + signature), we get sizes below 9kB for
our signature related to the PKP problem, below 15kB for our signature related
to the SD problem and below 7kB for our signature related to the RSD problem.

the service providers are facing a huge challenge to deliver ultra-HD (2k/4k)
video at sub-second latency. The multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform
actually helps in achieving this objective by caching popular contents at the
edge of cellular network. This not only reduces the delivery latency, but also
the load and the cost of the backhaul links. However, MEC platforms are
afflicted by constrained resources in terms of storage and processing
capabilities; and centralized caching of contents may nullify the advantage of
reduced latency by lowering the offloading probability. Distributed caching at
the edge not only improves the offloading probability, but also dynamically
adjusts the load distribution among the MEC servers. In this article, we
propose an architecture for deployment of MEC platforms by exploiting the
characteristics of a scalable video encoding technique. The layered video
coding techniques, such as the scalable video coding (SVC), is used by the
content providers to adjust to the network dynamics, by dynamically dropping
packets in order to reduce latency. We show how an SVC video easily lends
itself to distributed caching at the edge. Then we investigate the
latency-storage trade-off by storing the video layers at different parts of the
access networks.

match nodes or edges of two trees onto each other, and therefore have to either
rely on branch decompositions of both trees or have to use auxiliary node
properties to determine a matching. In contrast, branch mappings employ branch
properties instead of node similarity information, and are independent of
predetermined branch decompositions. Especially for topological features, which
are typically based on branch properties, this allows a more intuitive distance
measure which is also less susceptible to instabilities from small-scale

broad range of information retrieval and natural language processing tasks. As
the core part of PLM, multi-head self-attention is appealing for its ability to
jointly attend to information from different positions. However, researchers
have found that PLM always exhibits fixed attention patterns regardless of the
input (e.g., excessively paying attention to [CLS] or [SEP]), which we argue
might neglect important information in the other positions. In this work, we
propose a simple yet effective attention guiding mechanism to improve the
performance of PLM by encouraging attention towards the established goals.
Specifically, we propose two kinds of attention guiding methods, i.e., map
discrimination guiding (MDG) and attention pattern decorrelation guiding (PDG).
The former definitely encourages the diversity among multiple self-attention
heads to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces,
while the latter encourages self-attention to attend to as many different
positions of the input as possible. We conduct experiments with multiple
general pre-trained models (i.e., BERT, ALBERT, and Roberta) and
domain-specific pre-trained models (i.e., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, BlueBert, and

magnitude are of prime importance in seismology, particularly in applications
such as Earthquake Early Warning (EEW). Traditionally, algorithms such as
STA/LTA are used for event detection, while frequency or amplitude domain
parameters calculated from 1-3 seconds of first P-arrival data are sometimes
used to provide a first estimate of (body wave) magnitude. Owing to extensive
involvement of human experts in parameter determination, these approaches are
often found to be insufficient. Moreover, these methods are sensitive to the
signal to noise ratio and may often lead to false or missed alarms depending on
the choice of parameters. We, therefore, propose a multitasking deep learning
model the Convolutional Recurrent model for Earthquake Identification and
Magnitude Estimation (CREIME) that: (i) detects the first earthquake signal,
from background seismic noise, (ii) determines first P arrival time as well as
(iii) estimates the magnitude using the raw 3-component waveform data from a
single station as model input. Considering, speed is of essence in EEW, we use
up to two seconds of P-wave information which, to the best of our knowledge, is
a significantly smaller data window (5 second window with up to of P wave data)
compared to the previous studies. To examine the robustness of CREIME we test
it on two independent datasets and find that it achieves an average accuracy of
98 percent for event vs noise discrimination and is able to estimate first P
arrival time and local magnitude with average root mean squared errors of 0.13
seconds and 0.65 units, respectively. We also compare CREIME architecture with
architectures of other baseline models, by training them on the same data, and
also with traditional algorithms such as STA/LTA, and show that our

full 3-dimensional kinematic modelling with multiple combinations of kinematic
components, allowing us to infer whether these objects share any similarities
in their molecular gas structure. We use modelling to pinpoint the kinematic
centre of each galaxy, in order to interpret their minor- and major-axis
position velocity diagrams (PVDs). From the PVDs, we find that the bulk of the
molecular gas in our galaxies is dynamically cold, tracing the rotation curves
predicted by our symmetric, rotation-dominated models, but with minor flux
asymmetries. Most notably, we find evidence of radial gas motion in a subset of
our objects, which demonstrate a characteristic ""twisting"" in their minor-axis
PVDs generally associated with gas flow along the plane of a galaxy. In our
highest S/N object, we include bi-symmetric radial flow in our kinematic model,

gas motion is strongly favoured. This may provide one mechanism by which
molecular gas and star formation are centrally concentrated, enabling the
launch of massive ionised gas winds. However, in the remainder of our sample,
we do not observe evidence that gas is being driven radially, once again
emphasising the variety of physical processes that may be powering the outflows

dubbed energy-peaks. We consider the energy distribution of a massless particle
in the lab frame arising from the two-body decay of a heavy particle produced
unpolarized, whose boost distribution is arbitrary. Remarkably, the location of
the peak of this child particle's energy distribution is identical to its
single-valued energy in the rest frame of the parent, which is a function of
the parent's mass and that of the other decay product. We summarize
generalizations to other types of decay and a variety of applications to BSM.
The energy-peak idea can also furnish a measurement of the top quark via the
energy of the bottom quark from its decay, which, based on the
""parent-boost-invariance,"" is less sensitive to details of the production
mechanism of the top quark (cf.~most other methods assume purely SM production
of the top quarks, hence are subject to uncertainties therein, including a
possible BSM contribution). The original proposal along this line was to simply
use the $b$-jet energy as a very good approximation to the bottom quark energy.
This method has been successfully implemented by the CMS collaboration.
However, the $b$-jet energy-peak method is afflicted by the jet-energy scale
(JES) uncertainty. Fortunately, this drawback can be circumvented by using the
decay length of a $B$-hadron contained in the $b$-jet as a proxy for the bottom
quark energy. An interesting proposal is to then appropriately dovetail the
above two ideas resulting in a ""best of both worlds"" determination of the top
quark mass, i.e., based on a measurement of the $B$-hadron decay length, but
improved by the energy-peak concept: this would be free of JES uncertainty and
largely independent of the top quark production model. We summarize here the
results of such an analysis which is to appear in a forthcoming paper.

imposes new constraints on cosmological models with a varying $\alpha$. We
assume such a model where the electromagnetic sector is coupled to a scalar
field dark energy responsible for the current acceleration of the Universe. We
parametrise the variation of $\alpha$ with two extra parameters, one defining
the cosmological evolution of the quintessence component and the other fixing
the coupling with the electromagnetic field. The objective of this work is to
constrain these parameters with both astrophysical and local probes. We also
carried out a comparative analysis of how each data probe may constrain our
parametrisation. We performed a Bayesian analysis by comparing the predictions
of the model with observations. The astrophysical datasets are composed of
quasar spectra measurements, including the latest ESPRESSO data point, as well
as Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background. We combined these
with local results from atomic clocks and the MICROSCOPE experiment. The
constraints placed on the quintessence parameter are consistent with a null
variation of the field, and are therefore compatible with a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. The constraints on the coupling to the electromagnetic sector are
dominated by the E\""otv\""os parameter local bound. More precise measurements
with ESPRESSO will be extremely important to study the cosmological evolution
of $\alpha$ as it probes an interval of redshift not accessible to other types
of observations. However, for this particular model, current available data
favour a null variation of $\alpha$ resulting mostly from the strong MICROSCOPE

magnetic proprieties in atomically thin materials. However, inversion symmetry
breaking is usually required for the materials to generate a large signal. In
this work, we report a giant second-harmonic generation that arises below the
N\'eel temperature in few-layer centrosymmetric FePS$_3$. Layer-dependent study
indicates the detected signal is from the second-order nonlinearity of the
surface. The magnetism-induced surface second-harmonic response is two orders
of magnitude larger than those reported in other magnetic systems, with the
surface nonlinear susceptibility reaching 0.08--0.13 nm$^2$/V in 2 L--5 L
samples. By combing linear dichroism and second harmonic generation
experiments, we further confirm the giant second-harmonic generation is coupled
to nematic orders formed by the three possible Zigzag antiferromagnetic
domains. Our study shows that the surface second-harmonic generation is also a
sensitive tool to study antiferromagnetic states in centrosymmetric atomically
thin materials.

understanding. It aims to simultaneously predict the semantic label and the
temporal interval of every action instance in an untrimmed video. Rather than
end-to-end learning, most existing methods adopt a head-only learning paradigm,
where the video encoder is pre-trained for action classification, and only the
detection head upon the encoder is optimized for TAD. The effect of end-to-end
learning is not systematically evaluated. Besides, there lacks an in-depth
study on the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in end-to-end TAD. In this paper, we
present an empirical study of end-to-end temporal action detection. We validate
the advantage of end-to-end learning over head-only learning and observe up to
11\% performance improvement. Besides, we study the effects of multiple design
choices that affect the TAD performance and speed, including detection head,
video encoder, and resolution of input videos. Based on the findings, we build
a mid-resolution baseline detector, which achieves the state-of-the-art
performance of end-to-end methods while running more than 4$\times$ faster. We
hope that this paper can serve as a guide for end-to-end learning and inspire

is one of the most critical quantities in astrophysics for characterizing
stars. Equally important is the temporal evolution of a star's luminosity
because of its intimate connection with the stellar energy budget, large-scale
convective motion, and heat storage in the stellar interior. Here, we model the
solar luminosity by extending a semi-empirical total solar irradiance (TSI)
model that uses solar-surface magnetism to reconstruct solar irradiance over
the entire 4{\pi} solid angle around the Sun. This model was constrained by
comparing its output to the irradiance in the Earth's direction with the
measured TSI. Comparing the solar luminosity to the TSI on timescales from days
to for cycles 23 and 24, we find poor agreement on short timescales (< solar
rotation). On longer timescales, however, we find good agreement between the
luminosity model and the TSI, which suggests that the extrapolation of
luminosities to multi-cycle timescales based on TSI reconstructions may be
possible. We show that the solar luminosity is not constant but varies in phase
with the solar cycle. This variation has an amplitude of 0.14% from minimum to
maximum for solar cycle 23. Considering the energetics in the solar convection
zone, it is therefore obvious that a steady-state input from the radiative zone
at the solar minimum level would lead to a gradual reduction in the energy
content in the convection zone over multi-century timescales. We show that the
luminosity at the base of the convection zone should be approximately 0.032%
higher than that at the solar surface during solar minimum to maintain net
energy equilibrium through the solar cycle. These different energy-input
scenarios place constraints on the long-term evolution of the total solar
irradiance and its impact on the solar forcing of climate variability.

osteoporosis, vertebral fractures, and intervertebral disc herniation. To date,
various approaches have been developed in the literature which routinely relies
on detecting the discs as the primary step. A disadvantage of many cohort

novel U-Net-based structure to predict a set of candidates for intervertebral

gradients) to encourage the model to learn rich and generic geometrical
information. This additional signal guides the model to selectively emphasize
the contextual representation and suppress the less discriminative features. On
the post-processing side, to further decrease the false positive rate, we
propose a permutation invariant 'look once' model, which accelerates the
candidate recovery procedure. In comparison with previous studies, our proposed
approach does not need to perform the selection in an iterative fashion. The

as revealed by its morphological properties, which are fully described by $4$
Minkowski functionals (MFs), and quantify the constraints on the summed
neutrino mass $M_{\nu}$ from the MFs, by using publicly available N-body
simulations. We find the MFs provide important complementary information, and
give tighter constraints on $M_{\nu}$ than the power spectrum. Specifically,
depending on whether massive neutrinos are included in the density field (the
`m' field) or not (the `cb' field), we find the constraint on $M_{\nu}$ from
the MFs with a smoothing scale of $R_G=5 h^{-1}$Mpc is $48$ or $4$ times better
than that from the power spectrum. When the MFs are combined with the power
spectrum, they can improve the constraint on $M_{\nu}$ from the latter by a

examples of leptophobic $U(1)$ extensions in which the $Z'$ decays to
right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) with substantial branchings. The coexistence of a
leptophobic $Z^\prime$ and the RHNs opens up a new possibility of searching for
these particles simultaneously through the production of a $Z^\prime$ at the
LHC and its decay to a RHN pair. For this decay to occur, the RHNs need to be
lighter than the $Z^\prime$. Hence, we study this process in an inverse seesaw
setup where the RHNs can be in the TeV range. However, in this case, they have
a pseudo-Dirac nature, i.e., a RHN pair would produce only opposite-sign lepton
pairs, as opposed to the Majorana-type neutrinos, which can produce both same-
and opposite-sign lepton pairs. Hence, the final state we study has a
same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pair plus hadronically-decaying boosted $W$
bosons. Our analysis shows that the high luminosity LHC can discover a
TeV-scale leptophobic $Z^\prime$ decaying via a RHN pair in a wide range of
available parameters. Interestingly, large parameter regions beyond the reach

arrive from different sources stochastically with possibly different update
inter-generation time distributions. The server can transmit/serve at most one
update at any time, with potentially different transmission/service times for
updates belonging to distinct sources. The age of information (AoI) of any
source is a function of the time difference between the departure time of
successive updates of that source. Each fully/partially transmitted update
incurs a fixed (energy) cost, and the goal of the scheduler is to minimize the
linear combination of the sum of the age of information across all sources and
the total energy cost. We propose a simple non-preemptive randomized scheduling
algorithm that randomly marks arriving updates from a source to be eligible for
transmission with a fixed probability and discards them otherwise. Every time
the server becomes free, it chooses a source for transmission randomly with
another fixed probability and begins to transmit the most recently marked
update of the chosen source. Both the respective probabilities are chosen by
solving a convex program. The competitive ratio of the proposed algorithm
(against a non-preemptive offline optimal algorithm) is shown to be 3 plus the
maximum of the ratio of the variance and the mean of the inter-arrival time

accounting for more than 30\% of all cases and they develop from the glial stem
or progenitor cells. In theory, the majority of brain tumours could well be
identified exclusively by the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Each MRI
modality delivers distinct information on the soft tissue of the human brain
and integrating all of them would provide comprehensive data for the accurate
segmentation of the glioma, which is crucial for the patient's prognosis,
diagnosis, and determining the best follow-up treatment. Unfortunately, MRI is
prone to artifacts for a variety of reasons, which might result in missing one
or more MRI modalities. Various strategies have been proposed over the years to
synthesize the missing modality or compensate for the influence it has on
automated segmentation models. However, these methods usually fail to model the
underlying missing information. In this paper, we propose a style matching
U-Net (SMU-Net) for brain tumour segmentation on MRI images. Our co-training
approach utilizes a content and style-matching mechanism to distill the
informative features from the full-modality network into a missing modality
network. To do so, we encode both full-modality and missing-modality data into
a latent space, then we decompose the representation space into a style and
content representation. Our style matching module adaptively recalibrates the
representation space by learning a matching function to transfer the
informative and textural features from a full-modality path into a
missing-modality path. Moreover, by modelling the mutual information, our
content module surpasses the less informative features and re-calibrates the
representation space based on discriminative semantic features. The evaluation
process on the BraTS 2018 dataset shows a significant results.

temperature-dependent inelastic scattering rate) of several different doped 2D

asserting that $\hbar/\tau =k_\mathrm{B}T$ provides a scattering bound, where
$\tau$ is the appropriate relaxation time. The regime of transport considered
here is well-below the Bloch-Gruneisen regime so that phonon scattering is
negligible. The temperature-dependent part of the resistivity is almost
linear-in-$T$ down to arbitrarily low temperatures, with the linearity arising
from an interplay between screening and disorder, connected with carrier
scattering from impurity-induced Friedel oscillations. The temperature
dependence disappears if the Coulomb interaction between electrons is
suppressed. The temperature coefficient of the resistivity is enhanced at lower
densities, enabling a detailed study of the Planckian behavior both as a
function of the materials system and carrier density. Although the precise
Planckian bound never holds, we find somewhat surprisingly that the bound seems
to apply approximately with the scattering rate never exceeding $k_\mathrm{B}
T$ by more than an order of magnitude either in the experiment or in the
theory. In addition, we calculate the temperature-dependent electron-electron
inelastic scattering rate by obtaining the temperature-dependent self-energy
arising from Coulomb interaction, also finding it to obey the Planckian bound
within an order of magnitude at all densities and temperatures. We introduce
the concept of a generalized Planckian bound where $\hbar/\tau$ is bounded by
$\alpha k_\mathrm{B} T$ with $\alpha\sim 10$ or so in the super-Planckian
regime with the strict Planckian bound of $\alpha$=1 being a nongeneric
finetuned situation.

these observables can also be used to compute $r_s$-independent constraints on

different degeneracy directions, leading to the improved combined constraints,
with a bound of $H_0 = 67.1^{+2.5}_{-2.9}$ ($63.6^{+2.9}_{-3.6}$) from BOSS

without dependence on the sound horizon, our results are in $\approx 3\sigma$

an ionizing photon production efficiency of
$\log(\xi_{\mathrm{ion},0}/\mathrm{erg\ Hz}^{-1})=25.97^{+0.18}_{-0.28}$. Such
a high value for photo production, similar to the highest values found at

$f_\mathrm{esc}\lesssim0.3$ (at $2\sigma$) are sufficient for galaxies brighter
than $M_\mathrm{UV}<-18$ mag to re-ionize the neutral Hydrogen at $z\sim8$.
This requirement is relaxed even more to $f_\mathrm{esc}\le 0.1$ when
considering galaxies brighter than $M_\mathrm{UV}\approx -13$ mag, consistent
with recent luminosity functions and as typically assumed in studies addressing
re-ionization. These exceptional results clearly indicate that galaxies can be
the dominant source of reionizing photons, and provide us with an exciting
glimpse into what we might soon learn about the early universe, and
particularly about the Reionization Epoch, from forthcoming JWST/MIRI and

Since
the 1960's, the affirmative answer to this question has been well-understood
for $2 \to 2$ scattering of the lightest particle in theories with a mass gap
at low momentum transfer, where the S-matrix is analytic everywhere except at
normal-threshold branch cuts. We ask whether an analogous picture extends to
realistic theories, such as the Standard Model, that include massless fields,
UV/IR divergences, and unstable particles. Especially in the presence of light
states running in the loops, the traditional $i\varepsilon$ prescription for
approaching physical regions might break down, because causality requirements
for the individual Feynman diagrams can be mutually incompatible. We
demonstrate that such analyticity problems are not in contradiction with
unitarity. Instead, they should be thought of as finite-width effects that
disappear in the idealized $2\to 2$ scattering amplitudes with no unstable
particles, but might persist at higher multiplicity. To fix these issues, we
propose an $i\varepsilon$-like prescription for deforming branch cuts in the
space of Mandelstam invariants without modifying the analytic properties. This
procedure results in a complex strip around the real part of the kinematic
space, where the S-matrix remains causal. In addition to giving a pedagogical
introduction to the analytic properties of the perturbative S-matrix from a
modern point of view, we illustrate all the points on explicit examples, both
symbolically and numerically. To help with the investigation of related
questions, we introduce a number of tools, including holomorphic cutting rules,
new approaches to dispersion relations, as well as formulae for local behavior
of Feynman integrals near branch points.

identify the birth of the Galactic disk. We separate in-situ and accreted stars
on the basis of angular momenta and eccentricities. The sequence of high-alpha
in-situ stars persists down to at least [Fe/H]=-2.5 and shows unexpected
non-monotonic behavior: with increasing metallicity the population first
declines in [alpha/Fe], then increases over the range -1.3<[Fe/H]<-0.7, and
then declines again at higher metallicities. The number of stars in the in-situ
population rapidly increases above [Fe/H]=-1. The average kinematics of these
stars are hot and independent of metallicity at [Fe/H]<-1 and then become
increasingly cold and disk-like at higher metallicities. The ages of the
in-situ, high-alpha stars are uniformly very old (13 Gyr) at [Fe/H]<-1.3, and
span a wider range (8-12 Gyr) at higher metallicities. Interpreting the
chemistry with a simple chemical evolution model suggests that the
non-monotonic behavior is due to a significant increase in star formation
efficiency, which began 13 Gyr ago. These results support a picture in which
the first 1 Gyr of the Galaxy was characterized by a ""simmering phase"" in which
the star formation efficiency was low and the kinematics had substantial
disorder with some net rotation. The disk then underwent a dramatic
transformation to a ""boiling phase"", in which the star formation efficiency
increased substantially, the kinematics became disk-like, and the number of
stars formed increased tenfold. We interpret this transformation as the birth
of the Galactic disk at z~4. The physical origin of this transformation is
unclear and does not seem to be reproduced in current galaxy formation models.

appealing proposal to explain the seemingly coincidental structure of the
Standard Model. However, to realise the Standard Model at low energies, the
unified symmetry group has to be partially broken by a suitable scalar
potential in just the right way. The scalar potential contains several
couplings, whose values dictate the residual symmetry at a global minimum. Some
(and possibly many) of the corresponding symmetry-breaking patterns are
incompatible with the Standard Model and therefore non-admissible. Here, we
initiate a systematic study of radiative symmetry breaking to thereby constrain
viable initial conditions for the scalar couplings, for instance, at the Planck
scale. We combine these new constraints on an admissible scalar potential with
well-known constraints in the gauge-Yukawa sector into a general blueprint that
carves out the viable effective-field-theory parameter space of any underlying
theory of quantum gravity. We exemplify the constraining power of our blueprint
within a non-supersymmetric $\mathit{SO}(10)$ GUT containing a $\mathbf{16}_H$-
and a $\mathbf{45}_H$-dimensional scalar representation. We explicitly
demonstrate that the requirement of successful radiative symmetry breaking to
the correct subgroups significantly constraints the underlying microscopic
dynamics. The presence of non-admissible radiative minima can even entirely
exclude specific breaking chains: In the $\mathit{SO}(10)$ example, Pati-Salam
breaking chains cannot be realised since the respective minima are never the
deepest ones.

narrowing of the hysteresis (down to 150 K) and a gradual reduction in the

the $T$-evolution of Fe-$RE$ exchange coupling. Below 25 K, the SMR modulation
showed an abrupt change around the $c$-axis, marking the presence of

10 to 240 \Msun\,yr$^{-1}$, and global gas-phase metallicity (\oh) from 8.2 to

(inverted) gradients -- the relative abundance of oxygen increasing with
galactocentric radius, opposite the usual trend. Furthermore, 1/20 shows
negative gradients and 17/20 are consistent with flat gradients. This high
fraction of flat/inverted gradients is uncommon in simulations and previous
observations conducted in blank fields at similar redshifts. To understand
this, we investigate the correlations among various observed properties of our

global metallicity of our galaxies residing in extreme overdensities, and a
marked deficiency of metallicity in our massive galaxies as compared to their
coeval field counterparts. We conclude that the cold-mode gas accretion plays

the number of available 3D microscopy images is typically limited in
applications, we take a different approach and introduce a small CNN for
volumetric cell segmentation. Compared to previous CNN models for cell
segmentation, our model is efficient and has an asymmetric encoder-decoder
structure with very few parameters in the decoder. Training efficiency is
further improved via transfer learning. In addition, we introduce Context Aware
Pseudocoloring to exploit spatial context in z-direction of 3D images while
performing volumetric cell segmentation slice-wise. We evaluated our method
using different 3D datasets from the Cell Segmentation Benchmark of the Cell
Tracking Challenge. Our segmentation method achieves top-ranking results, while
our CNN model has an up to 25x lower number of parameters than other
top-ranking methods. Code and pretrained models are available at:

while rigorous analysis of their nonlinear mechanical behaviors still is very
challenging. The purpose of this paper is to connect the mathematical framework
of sweeping process originally proposed by Moreau to a generic class of Lattice
Spring Models with plasticity phenomenon. We explicitly construct a sweeping
process and provide numerical schemes to find the evolution of stresses in a
Lattice Spring Model with infinitesimal strains and perfect plasticity. In
particular, we develop a highly efficient ""leapfrog"" computational framework
that allow ones to rigorously track the progression of plastic events in the
system based on the sweeping process theory. The utility of our framework is
demonstrated by analyzing the elastoplastic stresses in a novel class of
disordered network materials exhibiting the property of hyperuniformity, in
which the infinite wave-length density fluctuations associated with the
distribution of network nodes are completely suppressed. We find enhanced
mechanical properties such as increasing stiffness, yield strength and tensile
strength as the degree of hyperuniformity of the material system increases. Our
results have implications for optimal network material design and our
event-based framework can be readily generalized for nonlinear stress analysis
of other heterogeneous material systems. We also include some insights to the
model from the viewpoint of the rigidity theory.

exponentially large classical probability distribution. Our analysis is
supported by extensive numerics on prototypical cellular automata and

most existing approaches for learning spatio-temporal representations rely on
manually trimmed videos, leading to limited diversity in visual patterns and
limited performance gain. In this work, we aim to learn representations by
leveraging more abundant information in untrimmed videos. To this end, we
propose to learn a hierarchy of consistencies in videos, i.e., visual
consistency and topical consistency, corresponding respectively to clip pairs
that tend to be visually similar when separated by a short time span and share
similar topics when separated by a long time span. Specifically, a hierarchical
consistency learning framework HiCo is presented, where the visually consistent
pairs are encouraged to have the same representation through contrastive
learning, while the topically consistent pairs are coupled through a topical
classifier that distinguishes whether they are topic related. Further, we
impose a gradual sampling algorithm for proposed hierarchical consistency
learning, and demonstrate its theoretical superiority. Empirically, we show
that not only HiCo can generate stronger representations on untrimmed videos,
it also improves the representation quality when applied to trimmed videos.
This is in contrast to standard contrastive learning that fails to learn
appropriate representations from untrimmed videos.

organized with the aid of the power counting proposed in [1] which gives rise
to the novel soft contributions in the CGC factorization. We achieve the
fully-differential calculation by constructing suitable subtraction terms to
handle the singularities in the real corrections. The subtraction contributions
can be exactly integrated analytically. We present the NLO cross section with
the jets constructed using the anti-$k_T$ algorithm. The NLO calculation
demonstrates explicitly the validity of the CGC factorization in jet
production. Furthermore, as a byproduct of the subtraction method, we also
derive the fully analytic cross section for the forward jet production in the
small-$R$ limit. We show that in the small-$R$ approximation, the forward jet
cross section can be factorized into a semi-hard cross section that produces a
parton and the semi-inclusive jet functions. We argue that this feature holds
for generic jet production and jet substructure observables in the CGC
framework. Last, we show numerical analyses of the derived formula to validate
our calculations. We justify when the small-$R$ approximation is appropriate.
Like forward hadron production, the obtained NLO result also exhibits the
negativity of the cross section in the large jet transverse regime, which
signals the need for the threshold resummation. A sketch of the threshold

spectrum with incumbent users and support various spectrum monitoring tasks
such as anomaly detection, fault diagnostics, user equipment identification,

spectrum for signal transmissions of interest over a large deployment area.
Each sensor receives signals under a specific channel condition depending on
its location and trains an individual model of a deep neural network (DNN)
accordingly to classify signals. To improve the accuracy, individual sensors
may exchange sensing data or sensor results with each other or with a fusion
center (such as in cooperative spectrum sensing). In this paper, distributed
federated learning over a multi-hop wireless network is considered to
collectively train a DNN for signal identification. In distributed federated
learning, each sensor broadcasts its trained model to its neighbors, collects
the DNN models from its neighbors, and aggregates them to initialize its own
model for the next round of training. Without exchanging any spectrum data,
this process is repeated over time such that a common DNN is built across the
network while preserving the privacy associated with signals collected at
different locations. Signal classification accuracy and convergence time are
evaluated for different network topologies (including line, star, ring, grid,
and random networks) and packet loss events. Then, the reduction of
communication overhead and energy consumption is considered with random
participation of sensors in model updates. The results show the feasibility of
extending cooperative spectrum sensing over a general multi-hop wireless
network through federated learning and indicate its robustness to wireless
network effects, thereby sustaining high accuracy with low communication

evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions

accuracy of the considered reaction rates. The 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction is
particularly important for the study of low- and intermediate-mass stars as it
determines the final C/O ratio in the core which influences the white dwarf
cooling evolution. Thus, there is a need for a study of how the computations of
white dwarfs and their progenitors that are made to date may be affected by the
uncertainties of the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rates. In this work we
compute fully evolutionary sequences using the MESA code with initial masses in
the range of 0.90 <= Mi/Msun <= 3.05. We consider different adopted reaction
rates, obtained from the literature, as well as the extreme limits within their
uncertainties. As expected, we find that previous to the core helium burning
stage there are no changes to the evolution of the stars. However, the
subsequent stages are all affected by the uncertainties of the considered
reaction rate. In particular, we find differences to the convective core mass
during the core helium burning stage which may affect pulsation properties of
subdwarfs, the number of thermal pulses during the asymptotic giant branch and
trends between final oxygen abundance in the core and the progenitor masses of
the remnant white dwarfs.

most likely to be ultimately observed in binary neutron star mergers. The
f-mode is known to correlate in normal neutron stars with their tidal
deformability, moment of inertia and quadrupole moment. Using a piecewise
polytropic parameterization scheme to model the uncertain hadronic high-density
EOS and a constant sound-speed scheme to model pure quark matter, we refine
this correlation and show that these universal relations also apply to both
self-bound stars and hybrid stars containing phase transitions. We identify a
novel 1-node branch of the f-mode that occurs in low-mass hybrid stars in a
narrow mass range just beyond the critical mass necessary for a phase
transition to appear. This 1-node branch shows the largest, but still small,
deviations from the universal correlation we have found. The g-mode frequency
only exists in matter with a non-barotropic equation of state involving
temperature, chemical potential or composition, or a phase transition in
barotropic matter. The g-mode therefore could serve as a probe for studying
phase transitions in hybrid stars. In contrast with the f-mode, discontinuity
g-mode frequencies depend strongly on properties of the transition (the density
and the magnitude of the discontinuity) at the transition. Imposing causality
and maximum mass constraints, the g-mode frequency in hybrid stars is found to
have an upper bound of about 1.25 kHz. However, if the sound speed c_s in the
inner core at densities above the phase transition density is restricted to
c_s^2 < c^2/3, the g-mode frequencies can only reach about 0.8 kHz, which are
significantly lower than f-mode frequencies, 1.3-2.8 kHz. Also, g-mode
gravitational wave damping times are extremely long, >10^4 s (10^2 s) in the
inner core with c_s^2< c^{2/3} (c^2), in comparison with the f-mode damping

robots to collaborate with human workers. However, existing interactive
industrial robots only guarantee intrinsic safety (reduce collision impact),
but not interactive safety (collision avoidance), which greatly limited their
flexibility. The issue arises from two limitations in existing control software
for industrial robots: 1) lack of support for real-time trajectory
modification; 2) lack of intelligent safe control algorithms with guaranteed
collision avoidance under robot dynamics constraints. To address the first
issue, a jerk-bounded position controller (JPC) was developed previously. This
paper addresses the second limitation, on top of the JPC. Specifically, we
introduce a jerk-based safe set algorithm (JSSA) to ensure collision avoidance
while considering the robot dynamics constraints. The JSSA greatly extends the
scope of the original safe set algorithm, which has only been applied for
second-order systems with unbounded accelerations. The JSSA is implemented on
the FANUC LR Mate 200id/7L robot and validated with HRI tasks. Experiments show
that the JSSA can consistently keep the robot at a safe distance from the human

reconstructs sub-voxel depth in the camera frustum. Third, as the foreground

find tentative evidence that the spin axis of HI-selected galaxies tend to be
aligned with associated filaments ($d<10$ Mpc), but this depends on the gas
fractions. Galaxies that have accumulated more stellar mass compared to their
gas mass tend towards stronger alignment. Our results suggest that those
galaxies that have accrued high gas fraction with respect to their stellar mass
may have had their spin axis alignment with the filament disrupted by a recent
gas-rich merger, whereas the spin vector for those galaxies in which the
neutral gas has not been strongly replenished through a recent merger tend to
orientate towards alignment with the filament. We also investigate the spin
transition between galaxies with a high HI content and a low HI content at a
threshold of $M_{\mathrm{HI}}\approx 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$ found in simulations,
however we find no evidence for such a transition with the current data.

by unfair opportunities and economic gains for product producers. This
unfairness will force producers to leave the system, and discourage new
producers from coming in. Eventually, fewer purchase options would be left for
customers and the overall transaction rates on e-commerce platforms would
decrease. Thus, how to maintain a balance between ranking relevance and

utilizing natural image priors based on a pre-trained StyleGAN2 network.
Compared with the existing two-steps methods of consecutive turbulence
mitigation and thermal to visible image translation, our method is demonstrated
to be effective in terms of both the visual quality of the reconstructed

reproducing the magnetoviscous effect in Poiseuille flow, obtaining the
rotational viscosity in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We
also illustrate the new method for the benchmark problem of flow around a
square cylinder. Interestingly, we observe that the length of the recirculation

when an external magnetic field is applied, compared with the field-free case
at the same effective Reynolds number. The presence of thermal fluctuations and
the flexibility of this particle-based mesoscopic method provides a promising
tool to investigate a broad range of flow phenomena of magnetic fluids and

critical for confronting cosmological theories with observations, not least for
likelihood approximations and parameter inference. The price to pay for
accurate estimates is the extreme cost of running $N$-body and hydrodynamics
simulations. Approximate solvers, or surrogates, greatly reduce the
computational cost but can introduce significant biases, for example in the
non-linear regime of cosmic structure growth. We propose ""CARPool Bayes"", an
approach to solve the inference problem for both the means and covariances
using a combination of simulations and surrogates. Our framework allows
incorporating prior information for the mean and covariance. We derive
closed-form solutions for Maximum A Posteriori covariance estimates that are
efficient Bayesian shrinkage estimators, guarantee positive semi-definiteness,
and can optionally leverage analytical covariance approximations. We discuss
choices of the prior and propose a simple procedure for obtaining optimal prior
hyperparameter values with a small set of test simulations. We test our method
by estimating the covariances of clustering statistics of GADGET-III $N$-body
simulations at redshift $z=0.5$ using surrogates from a 100-1000$\times$ faster
particle-mesh code. Taking the sample covariance from 15,000 simulations as the
truth, and using an empirical Bayes prior with diagonal blocks, our estimator
produces nearly identical Fisher matrix contours for $\Lambda$CDM parameters
using only $15$ simulations of the non-linear dark matter power spectrum. In
this case the number of simulations is so small that the sample covariance
would be degenerate. We show cases where even with a na\""ive prior our method
still improves the estimate. Our framework is applicable to a wide range of
cosmological and astrophysical problems where fast surrogates are available.

realistic semi-infinite nonlinear waveguide array (WA) in the context of
\textit{diffractive resonant radiation} (DifRR). Depending on the initial
amplitude ($A_0$) and wavenumber ($k_0$), a co-moving pair of identical DSs
either collide elastically or merge to form a discrete \textit{breather}. For
large amplitude and small wavenumber, DSs form a bound state and do not
interact .
  We map the domain of interaction by iterative simulation and present a phase
plot in ($A_0$-$k_0$) parameter space.
  A variational technique is developed where the interaction term is considered
as perturbation. A proper choice of Lagrangian density and the
\textit{ans\""{a}tz} function followed by the Ritz optimization leads us to a
set of ordinary differential equations that describe the collision mechanism.
The analytical result corroborate well with numerical data.
  We further investigate the role of initial phase detuning between two
identical DS and observe a periodic energy exchange during their interaction.
  Varied degree of energy exchange occurs when two DS with different
wavenumbers collide which results in three distinct output states accompanied
by DifRR generation.
  Extending our investigation to a more generalized condition by taking
different amplitudes and wavenumber of DS pair, we find an unique secondary
radiation in $k$-space which is originated due to the collision of solitons.
  The nature of this collision mediated secondary radiation is found to be
different from usual DifRR.
  Our results shed light on the interesting aspects of the collision dynamics
of DS pair in nonlinear WA and useful in understanding the complex mechanism.

and $m$ edges: $n$-Pairs Shortest Paths ($n$-PSP), where the goal is to find a
shortest path between $O(n)$ prespecified pairs, and All Node Shortest Cycles
(ANSC), where the goal is to find the shortest cycle passing through each node.
Approximate $n$-PSP has been previously studied, mostly in the context of
distance oracles. We ask the question of whether approximate $n$-PSP can be
solved faster than by using distance oracles or All Pair Shortest Paths (APSP).
ANSC has also been studied previously, but only in terms of exact algorithms,
rather than approximation. We provide a thorough study of the approximability
of $n$-PSP and ANSC, providing a wide array of algorithms and conditional lower
bounds that trade off between running time and approximation ratio.
  A highlight of our conditional lower bounds results is that for any integer
$k\ge 1$, under the combinatorial $4k$-clique hypothesis, there is no
combinatorial algorithm for unweighted undirected $n$-PSP with approximation
ratio better than $1+1/k$ that runs in $O(m^{2-2/(k+1)}n^{1/(k+1)-\epsilon})$
time. This nearly matches an upper bound implied by the result of Agarwal
(2014).
  A highlight of our algorithmic results is that one can solve both $n$-PSP and
ANSC in $\tilde O(m+ n^{3/2+\epsilon})$ time with approximation factor
$2+\epsilon$ (and additive error that is function of $\epsilon$), for any
constant $\epsilon>0$. For $n$-PSP, our conditional lower bounds imply that
this approximation ratio is nearly optimal for any subquadratic-time
combinatorial algorithm. We further extend these algorithms for $n$-PSP and
ANSC to obtain a time/accuracy trade-off that includes near-linear time
algorithms.

its representation in the embedding space becomes inconsistent with the real
identity, allowing reliable detection. Training is carried out exclusively on
real talking-face video; thus, the detector does not depend on any specific
manipulation method and yields the highest generalization ability. In addition,
our method can detect both single-modality (audio-only, video-only) and
multi-modality (audio-video) attacks, and is robust to low-quality or corrupted

remedies to this problem focus on modifying either the pre-training or task
fine-tuning objectives to incorporate knowledge, which normally require
additional costly training or architecture modification of LMs for practical
applications. We present Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) -- a novel decoding
algorithm for generative LMs, which dynamically infuses external knowledge into
each step of the LM decoding. Specifically, we maintain a local knowledge
memory based on the current context, interacting with a dynamically created
external knowledge trie, and continuously update the local memory as a
knowledge-aware constraint to guide decoding via reinforcement learning. On six
diverse knowledge-intensive NLG tasks, task-agnostic LMs (e.g., GPT-2 and BART)
armed with KID outperform many task-optimized state-of-the-art models, and show
particularly strong performance in few-shot scenarios over seven related

generate more relevant and factual language for the input context when compared

Yet, the frictional properties of grains make the statistical physics of

physics of atomic or molecular systems. We illustrate here on simple models
some of the key concepts of the statistical physics introduced by Edwards and
coworkers more than thirty years ago to describe shaken granular piles. Quite
surprisingly, properties of such frictional systems observed at high effective
temperature (i.e., strong shaking) may share some analogies with some low
temperature properties of equilibrium systems. For instance, the effective
specific heat of non-interacting frictional grains under strong shaking in a
harmonic potential goes to zero in the high temperature limit. As a second
example, a chain of frictional grains linked by springs exhibits a critical
point at infinite effective temperature, at odds with the zero-temperature
critical point generically found in one-dimensional equilibrium systems in the
presence of local interactions.

and Hariharan [SODA'98, J. Comput.'02] gave an $\mathcal{O}(n+k^4 \cdot n/

improved since.
  Here, we present an algorithm that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(n+k^{3.5}
\sqrt{\log m \log k} \cdot n/m)$, thus breaking through this long-standing
barrier. In the case where $n^{1/4+\varepsilon} \leq k \leq

algorithm relies only on a small set of primitive operations on strings and
thus also applies to the fully-compressed setting (where text and pattern are

a collection of strings under creation, splitting, and concatenation),
improving over the state of the art.

Some such features have already been experimentally demonstrated in the noisy

random quantum circuits have been studied on a case-by-case basis and for
certain specific systems, a hallmark of quantum chaos - universal Wigner-Dyson
level statistics - has been derived. This work develops an effective field
theory for a large class of random quantum circuits. The theory has the form of
a replica sigma model and is similar to the low-energy approach to diffusion in
disordered systems. The method is used to explicitly derive universal random
matrix behavior of a large family of random circuits. In particular, we
rederive Wigner-Dyson spectral statistics of the brickwork circuit model by
Chan, De Luca, and Chalker [Phys. Rev. X 8, 041019 (2018)] and show within the
same calculation that its various permutations and higher-dimensional
generalizations preserve the universal level statistics. Finally, we use the
replica sigma model framework to rederive the Weingarten calculus, which is a
method to evaluate integrals of polynomials of matrix elements with respect to
the Haar measure over compact groups and has many applications in the studies
of quantum circuits. The effective field theory, derived here, provides both a
method to quantitatively characterize quantum dynamics of random Floquet
systems (e.g., calculating operator and entanglement spreading) and also path
to understanding the general fundamental mechanism behind quantum chaos and
thermalization in these systems.

fluentTQL queries can express various taint-style vulnerability types, e.g.

fluentTQL's abstract and concrete syntax and defines its runtime semantics. The
semantics are independent of any underlying analysis and allows evaluation of
fluentTQL queries by a variety of taint analyses. Instantiations of fluentTQL,
on top of two taint analysis solvers, Boomerang and FlowDroid, show and
validate fluentTQL expressiveness. Based on existing examples from the

in Java. Using our SQL injection specification, the Boomerang-based taint
analysis found all 17 known taint-flows in the OWASP WebGoat application,

spectroscopy. The islands have been grown by high-temperature oxygen-assisted
molecular beam epitaxy. Below 100 K and for thicknesses above 20 nm the Raman
spectra correspond to those observed in bulk crystals and high quality thin
films for the sub-Verwey magnetite structure. At room temperature the width of
the cubic phase modes is similar to the best reported in bulk crystals,
indicating a similar level of electron-phonon interaction. The evolution of the
Raman spectra upon cooling suggests that for islands thicker than 20 nm,
structural changes appear first at temperatures starting at 150 K and the
Verwey transition itself takes place at around 115 K. However, islands thinner
than 20 nm show a very different Raman spectra indicating that while a
transition takes place, the charge order of the ultrathin islands differs
markedly from their thicker counterparts

Beyond this use of seeds, specific IR methods can exploit seed studies for

birds-in-flight are studied with a thermal model. Avian formation-flying is
tested as a self-organization process. The maximum entropy production rate
(MEPR) postulate is examined to determine its applicability to the observed V
formation during the long-distance migration of large birds. A brief discussion
of the principles of the rate of entropy generation maximization or
minimization is first presented. The V formation is compared to other closely
related, but distinctly different formations that can also be adopted by a
flock. The thermodynamic analysis from the results of the model indicates that
the V formation (named the SV formation in the article) is found to be the
pattern that optimizes energy use for the flight duration. This is accomplished
with savings in the formation's thermal energy output (heat) by the trailing
birds. The MEPR postulate is found to hold for the V formation. The formation
also provides for the highest comfort temperatures, perhaps thereby allowing
for high altitude (low drag) flight levels to be accessed by the birds. The
results of the model point to thermal awareness as a possible key driver for
organization into a V formation. The thermal model appears to validate all the
major experimental observations of avian formation flying. Regardless, without
detailed thermal measurements to validate, and without a physical basis for the
constant used in equation (C4d), it is not yet definitive that this thermal
model is valid for avian flight formation. The analysis appears to indicate
that the organization into patterns of live objects may follow the MEPR
principle for self-organization in a manner previously noted for chemical and
metallurgical processes.

Previous works either apply spherical texture maps which may lead to large
distortions, or use continuous texture fields that yield smooth outputs lacking
details. We argue that the traditional way of representing textures with images
and linking them to a 3D mesh via UV mapping is more desirable, since
synthesizing 2D images is a well-studied problem. We propose AUV-Net which
learns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the
corresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the
UV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be
easily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned
in an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module,
taking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning. The
learned UV mapping and aligned texture representations enable a variety of
applications including texture transfer, texture synthesis, and textured single

spacecrafts, it is desirable to only apply a given controller in an
intermittent manner--with periods where the controller is on and periods where
it is off. Motivated by the event-triggered control paradigm, where
state-dependent triggers are utilized in a sample-and-hold context, we
generalize this concept to include state triggers where the controller is off
thereby creating a framework for intermittent control. Our approach utilizes
certificates--either Lyapunov or barrier functions--to design intermittent
trigger laws that guarantee stability or safety; the controller is turned on
for the period for which is beneficial with regard to the certificate, and
turned off until a performance threshold is reached. The main result of this
paper is that the intermittent controller scheme guarantees (set) stability
when Lyapunov functions are utilized, and safety (forward set invariance) in
the setting of barrier functions. As a result, our trigger designs can leverage
the intermittent nature of the actuator, and at the same time, achieve the task
of stabilization or safety. We further demonstrate the application and benefits

based on a reference garment image along with user feedback on what to change
on the reference garment. Two IGR tasks have been studied extensively:
text-guided garment retrieval (TGR) and visually compatible garment retrieval
(VCR). The user feedback for the former indicates what semantic attributes to
change with the garment category preserved, while the category is the only
thing to be changed explicitly for the latter, with an implicit requirement on
style preservation. Despite the similarity between these two tasks and the
practical need for an efficient system tackling both, they have never been
unified and modeled jointly. In this paper, we propose a Unified Interactive
Garment Retrieval (UIGR) framework to unify TGR and VCR. To this end, we first
contribute a large-scale benchmark suited for both problems. We further propose
a strong baseline architecture to integrate TGR and VCR in one model. Extensive
experiments suggest that unifying two tasks in one framework is not only more
efficient by requiring a single model only, it also leads to better

task that aims to align aspects and corresponding sentiments for
aspect-specific sentiment polarity inference. It is challenging because a

coordinating, or adversative) relations. Recently, exploiting dependency syntax
information with graph neural networks has been the most popular trend. Despite
its success, methods that heavily rely on the dependency tree pose challenges
in accurately modeling the alignment of the aspects and their words indicative

exploits the syntax information (e.g., phrase segmentation and hierarchical

context of every single aspect (called intra-context) and the sentiment
relations across aspects (called inter-context) for learning. Experiments on

Although a number of proper scoring rules for probability distributions having

construction is to use pairs of observations. We show that the proposed score

Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer. A small number of strong,
highly scattering lines dominate the cooling and heating in the chromosphere.
Additionally, the recombination times of ionised hydrogen are longer than the
dynamical timescales, requiring a non-equilibrium (NE) treatment of hydrogen
ionisation. The MURaM code is extended to include the physical process required
for accurate simulation of the solar chromosphere, as implemented in the
Bifrost code. This includes a time-dependent treatment of hydrogen ionisation,
a scattering multi-group radiation transfer scheme and approximations for NLTE
radiative cooling. The inclusion of NE and NLTE physics has a large impact on
the structure of the chromosphere; the NE treatment of hydrogen ionisation
leads to a higher ionisation fraction and enhanced populations in the first
excited state throughout cold inter-shock regions of the chromosphere.
Additionally this prevents hydrogen ioniation from buffering energy
fluctuations, leading to hotter shocks and cooler inter-shock regions. The
hydrogen populations in the ground and first excited state are enhanced by
$10^2-10^3$ in the upper chromosphere and up to $10^9$ near the transition
region. Including the necessary NLTE physics leads to significant differences
in chromospheric structure and dynamics. The thermodynamics and hydrogen
populations calculated using the extended version of the MURaM code are
consistent with previous non-equilibrium simulations. The electron number and
temperature calculated using the non-equilibrium treatment of the chromosphere
are required to accurately synthesise chromospheric spectral lines.

damage and failure of a complex system. Yet high-fidelity digital twin models
can be computationally expensive, making quick-turnaround assessment
challenging. Towards this goal, this article proposes a novel bi-fidelity
method for estimating the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) for nonlinear
systems subject to dependent and high-dimensional inputs. For models that can
be evaluated fast, a method that integrates the dimensionally decomposed
generalized polynomial chaos expansion (DD-GPCE) approximation with a standard
sampling-based CVaR estimation is proposed. For expensive-to-evaluate models, a
new bi-fidelity method is proposed that couples the DD-GPCE with a
Fourier-polynomial expansion of the mapping between the stochastic low-fidelity
and high-fidelity output data to ensure computational efficiency. The method
employs measure-consistent orthonormal polynomials in the random variable of
the low-fidelity output to approximate the high-fidelity output. Numerical
results for a structural mechanics truss with 36-dimensional (dependent random
variable) inputs indicate that the DD-GPCE method provides very accurate CVaR
estimates that require much lower computational effort than standard GPCE
approximations. A second example considers the realistic problem of estimating
the risk of damage to a fiber-reinforced composite laminate. The high-fidelity
model is a finite element simulation that is prohibitively expensive for risk
analysis, such as CVaR computation. Here, the novel bi-fidelity method can
accurately estimate CVaR as it includes low-fidelity models in the estimation
procedure and uses only a few high-fidelity model evaluations to significantly
increase accuracy.

multicopters, but it may function poorly in environments with few visual
features or in overly aggressive flights. In this work, we propose a
perception-aware collision avoidance trajectory planner for multicopters, that
may be used with any feature-based VIO algorithm. Our approach is able to fly
the vehicle to a goal position at fast speed, avoiding obstacles in an unknown
stationary environment while achieving good VIO state estimation accuracy. The
proposed planner samples a group of minimum jerk trajectories and finds
collision-free trajectories among them, which are then evaluated based on their
speed to the goal and perception quality. Both the motion blur of features and
their locations are considered for the perception quality. Our novel
consideration of the motion blur of features enables automatic adaptation of
the trajectory's aggressiveness under environments with different light levels.
The best trajectory from the evaluation is tracked by the vehicle and is
updated in a receding horizon manner when new images are received from the
camera. Only generic assumptions about the VIO are made, so that the planner
may be used with various existing systems. The proposed method can run in
real-time on a small embedded computer on board. We validated the effectiveness
of our proposed approach through experiments in both indoor and outdoor
environments. Compared to a perception-agnostic planner, the proposed planner
kept more features in the camera's view and made the flight less aggressive,
making the VIO more accurate. It also reduced VIO failures, which occurred for
the perception-agnostic planner but not for the proposed planner. The ability
of the proposed planner to fly through dense obstacles was also validated. The

framework of a constituent quark model in which the parity-conserving pole
terms were found to be dominant in $\Xi_c\to\Lambda_c\pi$ decays. Since the
pion produced in the HFC process is soft, we apply current algebra to study
both $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes and employ the bag and diquark models to
estimate the matrix elements of four-quark operators. We confirm that
$\Xi_c\to\Lambda_c\pi$ decays are indeed dominated by the parity-conserving
transition induced from nonspectator $W$-exchange and that they receive largest
contributions from the intermediate $\Sigma_c$ pole terms. We also show that
the $S$-wave of $\Omega_b\to \Xi_b \pi$ decays vanishes in the heavy quark
limit, while $\Omega_c\to \Xi_c\pi$ receive additional $W$-exchange
contributions via $cs\to dc$ transition.

codes over finite fields. This structure undergoes a series of generalizations
to present algebraic descriptions of constacyclic, quasi-cyclic (QC),

codes. The correspondence between these codes and submodules of the free
$\mathbb{F}_q[x]$-module $\left(\mathbb{F}_q[x]\right)^\ell$ is established.
Thus, any of these codes corresponds to a free linear code over the principal
ideal domain (PID) $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$. A basis of this code exists and is used
to build a generator matrix with polynomial entries, called the generator
polynomial matrix (GPM). The Hermite normal form of matrices over PIDs is
exploited to achieve the reduced GPMs of MT codes. Some properties of the
reduced GPM are introduced, for example, the identical equation. A formula for
a GPM of the dual code $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ of a MT code is given. At this
point, special attention is paid to QC codes. For a QC code $\mathcal{C}$, we
define its reversed code $\mathcal{R}$. We call $\mathcal{C}$ reversible or
self-dual if $\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{C}$ or $\mathcal{C}^\perp=\mathcal{C}$,

GPMs for QC codes that combine reversibility and
self-duality/self-orthogonality. For the reader interested in running computer
search for optimal codes, we show the existence of binary self-orthogonal
reversible QC codes that have the best known parameters as linear codes. These

on a time-dependent residual version (R-DSGS) in contrast to a time-independent

reference model by Smagorinsky and Lilly for their ability to: (i) stabilize
the numerical solution, (ii) minimize undershoots and overshoots, (iii)
capture/preserve discontinuities, and (iv) transfer energy across different
length scales. These abilities are investigated on problems for: (1) passively
advected tracers, (2) coupled, nonlinear system of equations exhibiting
discontinuities, (3) gravity-driven flows in a stratified atmosphere, and (4)
homogenous, isotropic turbulence. All models were able to preserve sharp
discontinuities. Vreman and the R-DSGS models also reduce the undershoots and
overshoots in the solution of linear and non-linear advection with sharp

$D$ denotes the full width of the rectangular aperture included in the

${}^{6}{\rm Li}$. This concordance left little room for depletion of
${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ depletion, and implied that the more robust ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$
largely evaded destruction. Recent (re)-observations of halo stars challenge
the evidence against ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ depletion: i) lithium abundances now show
significant dispersion, and ii) sensitive ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ searches now reveal
only firm upper limits to the ${}^{6}{\rm Li}/{}^{7}{\rm Li}$ ratio. The tight
new ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ upper limits generally fall far below the predictions of
cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis, implying that substantial ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$
depletion has occurred--by factors up to 50. We show that in stars with
${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ limits and thus lower bounds on ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ depletion, an
equal amount of ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ depletion is more than sufficient to resolve
the primordial ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ Problem. This picture is consistent with
stellar models in which ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ is less depleted than ${}^{6}{\rm
Li}$, and strengthen the case that the Lithium Problem has an astrophysical
solution. We conclude by suggesting future observations that could test these
ideas. (abridged)

learning models over distributed edge devices, which attracts sustained

centralized training. It causes the locally trained models of clients to move
in different directions. On the one hand, it slows down or even stalls the
global updates, leading to inefficient communication. On the other hand, it
enlarges the distances between local models, resulting in an aggregated global
model with poor performance. Fortunately, these shortcomings can be mitigated
by reducing the angle between the directions that local models move in. Based
on this fact, we propose FedCos, which reduces the directional inconsistency of
local models by introducing a cosine-similarity penalty. It promotes the local
model iterations towards an auxiliary global direction. Moreover, our approach
is auto-adapt to various non-IID settings without an elaborate selection of
hyperparameters. The experimental results show that FedCos outperforms the
well-known baselines and can enhance them under a variety of FL scenes,

distant sources, with emphasis on quasar optical variability. In addition to
gravitational lensing such clouds affect flux measurements via refraction in
the neutral gas and via dust extinction, leading to a variety of possible light
curves even in the low optical depth limit. We classify and illustrate the
types of light curves that can arise. For sources as large as quasars we show
that gravitational lensing and extinction are the dominant effects, with gas
refraction playing only a minor role. We find that clouds with mass
~10^{-4.5+/-0.5} M_\odot can reproduce the observed distribution of quasar
variation amplitudes, but only if such clouds make up a large fraction of the
closure density. In that case there may also be substantial extinction of
distant optical sources, which can in principle be constrained by data on
""standard candles"" such as type Ia supernovae. Unfortunately that extinction is
essentially grey, even when the material opacity is strongly wavelength
dependent, making it difficult to distinguish from the influence of the
background geometry. We propose a novel statistical test of the origin of
quasar variability, based on the angular structure of the variation timescale
for a large number of quasars distributed all over the sky. If quasar
variability is primarily due to nanolensing that angular structure is expected
to include a quadrupole term of amplitude $\sim5\%$, which ought to be
measurable with future data from the Gaia mission.

imaging applications, there is a critical need to understand spectral
characteristics of scattered x-ray photons. Scattered radiation is detrimental
to x-ray imaging by reducing image quality and quantitative accuracy. While
various scatter correction techniques have been proposed for x-ray imaging with
conventional energy-integrating detectors, additional efforts are required to
develop approaches for spectral x-ray imaging with energy-resolving PCDs. We
show the benefits of accurate scatter estimation and correction for each energy
bin when using a photon counting detector. We propose a scatter estimation
model that accounts for the energy-dependent scatter characteristics in
projection x-ray imaging. This can then be used to restore quantitative
accuracy for spectral x-ray imaging with PCDs. Results are shown in the context
of contrast-enhanced spectral mammography using dual-energy subtraction to
digitally isolate iodine targets. In the presence of scatter, the projected
iodine densities are increasingly underestimated as the object thickness
increases. The energysensitive scatter correction improves the iodine density
estimation. These results suggest that our scatter estimation model can
accurately account for the energy-dependent scatter distribution, which can be
an effective tool for scatter compensation in spectral x-ray imaging.
Implementing this scatter estimation model does not require any modifications

Motivated by this line of work, we consider a multi-agent min-max learning

Byzantine adversarial agents in such a setup. By drawing on recent results from
robust statistics, we design a robust distributed variant of the extra-gradient
algorithm - a popular algorithmic approach for min-max optimization. Our main
contribution is to provide a crisp analysis of the proposed robust
extra-gradient algorithm for smooth convex-concave and smooth strongly
convex-strongly concave functions. Specifically, we establish statistical rates
of convergence to approximate saddle points. Our rates are near-optimal, and
reveal both the effect of adversarial corruption and the benefit of
collaboration among the non-faulty agents. Notably, this is the first paper to
provide formal theoretical guarantees for large-scale distributed min-max

programmers of concurrent (shared-variable) code. It provides a range of
mechanisms that abstract from underlying hardware memory models -- that govern
how multicore architectures handle concurrent accesses to main memory -- as
well as abstracting from compiler transformations. The C standard describes the
memory model in terms of cross-thread relationships between events, and has
been influenced by several research works that are similarly based. In this
paper we provide a thread-local definition of the fundamental principles of the
C memory model, which, for concise concurrent code, serves as a basis for
relatively straightforward reasoning about the effects of the C ordering
mechanisms. We argue that this definition is more practical from a programming
perspective and is amenable to analysis by already established techniques for
concurrent code. The key aspect is that the memory model definition is separate
to other considerations of a rich programming language such as C, in
particular, expression evaluation and optimisations, though we show how to
reason about those considerations in the presence of C concurrency. A major
simplification of our framework compared to the description in the C standard
and related work in the literature is separating out considerations around the
""lack of multicopy atomicity"", a concept that is in any case irrelevant to
developers of code for x86, Arm, RISC-V or SPARC architectures. We show how the

formally addressing unintuitive behaviours such as ""out-of-thin-air"" writes.

operator network(DeepONet) has been proposed recently for operator learning.
Compared to other neural networks to learn functions, it aims at the problem of
learning nonlinear operators. However, it can be challenging by using the
original model to learn nonlinear operators for high-dimensional stochastic
problems. We propose a new multi-resolution autoencoder DeepONet model referred
to as MultiAuto-DeepONet to deal with this difficulty with the aid of
convolutional autoencoder. The encoder part of the network is designed to
reduce the dimensionality as well as discover the hidden features of
high-dimensional stochastic inputs. The decoder is designed to have a special
structure, i.e. in the form of DeepONet. The first DeepONet in decoder is
designed to reconstruct the input function involving randomness while the
second one is used to approximate the solution of desired equations. Those two
DeepONets has a common branch net and two independent trunk nets. This
architecture enables us to deal with multi-resolution inputs naturally. By
adding $L_1$ regularization to our network, we found the outputs from the
branch net and two trunk nets all have sparse structures. This reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the neural network thus making the model more
efficient. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed MultiAuto-DeepONet model with uncertainty

patterns are discovered in this study and characterized by molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. Square icing parameters are proposed to quantitatively
distinguish the partitioned patterns from the homogeneous patterns and the
liquid water. The number of graphene monolayers n is varied in this study, and
the results show that it is more energetically favorable to form partitioned
square icing patterns when the water molecules are confined between graphite
sheets (n >= 2) compared to graphene (n = 1). This phenomenon is insensitive to
n as long as n >= 2, because of the short-range nature of the interaction
between water molecules and the carbon substrate. Moreover, it is energetically
unfavorable to form partitioned square icing patterns for a single layer of
water molecules even for n >= 2, verifying that the interaction between layers
of water molecules is another dominant factor in the formation of partitioned
structures. The conversion from partitioned structure to homogenous square
patterns is investigated by changing the pressure and the temperature. Based on
the comprehensive MD simulations, this study unveils the formation mechanism of
the partitioned square icing patterns.

We fit the lightcurve with a magnetar precession model by adopting the Markov

well represented with our model. The derived magnetic field strength of the
magnetar is $B_{\rm p}= (1.02^{+0.59}_{-0.61})\times10^{15}$~G. It rapidly
spins down with angular velocity evolving as $\Omega_{s} \propto(1+t/\tau_{\rm

is even faster than $\Omega_s$, i.e. $\Omega_{ p}\propto

we propose Parameter Service, an elastic model aggregation framework for DDL

training jobs and provides a shared model aggregation service to all jobs in
the cluster. In Parameter Service, model aggregations are efficiently packed
and dynamically migrated to fit into the available CPUs with negligible time
overhead. Furthermore, Parameter Service can elastically manage its CPU
resources based on its load to enhance resource efficiency. We have implemented
Parameter Service in a prototype system called AutoPS and evaluated it via
testbed experimentation and trace-driven simulations. AutoPS reduces up to 75%

consists of two modified multilayer perceptrons (MLPs): (i) ShapeNet, which

accounts for any other input complexity, including parametric dependencies,
time, and sensor measurements. We demonstrate the utility of NIF for parametric
surrogate modeling, enabling the interpretable representation and compression
of complex spatio-temporal dynamics, efficient many-spatial-query tasks, and
improved generalization performance for sparse reconstruction.

specifically, an attack is considered to be stealthy if it is stealthy from
(i.e., undetected by) any intrusion detector -- i.e., the probability of the
detection is not better than a random guess. We then provide a sufficient
condition under which a nonlinear control system is vulnerable to stealthy
attacks, in terms of moving the system to an unsafe region due to the attacks.
In particular, we show that if the closed-loop system is incrementally
exponentially stable while the open-loop plant is incrementally unstable, then
the system is vulnerable to stealthy yet impactful attacks on sensors. Finally,

multiuser communication by jointly considering (i) the meaning of the

have defined a scenario where multiple users (sensors) are continuously
transmitting their own states concerning a predetermined event. On the receiver
side there is an alarm monitoring system, whose function is to decide whether
such a predetermined event has happened in a certain time period and, if yes,
in which user. The media access control protocol proposed constitutes an
alternative approach to the conventional physical layer methods, because the
receiver does not decode the received waveform directly; rather, the relative
position of the absence or presence of energy within a multidimensional
resource space carries the (semantic) information. The protocol introduced here
provides high efficiency in multiuser networks that operate with
event-triggered sampling by enabling a constructive reconstruction of
transmission collisions. We have demonstrated that the proposed method leads to
a better event transmission efficiency than conventional methods like TDMA and
slotted ALOHA. Remarkably, the proposed method achieves 100\% efficiency and

transformer-based Natural Language Processing models. This attention mechanism
calculates a correlation score for each word with respect to the other words in
a sentence. Commonly, only a small subset of words highly correlates with the
word under attention, which is only determined at runtime. As such, a
significant amount of computation is inconsequential due to low attention
scores and can potentially be pruned. The main challenge is finding the
threshold for the scores below which subsequent computation will be
inconsequential. Although such a threshold is discrete, this paper formulates
its search through a soft differentiable regularizer integrated into the loss
function of the training. This formulation piggy backs on the back-propagation
training to analytically co-optimize the threshold and the weights
simultaneously, striking a formally optimal balance between accuracy and
computation pruning. To best utilize this mathematical innovation, we devise a
bit-serial architecture, dubbed LeOPArd, for transformer language models with
bit-level early termination microarchitectural mechanism. We evaluate our
design across 43 back-end tasks for MemN2N, BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and Vision
transformer models. Post-layout results show that, on average, LeOPArd yields
1.9x and 3.9x speedup and energy reduction, respectively, while keeping the
average accuracy virtually intact (<0.2% degradation)

background light (EBL) prevents the observation of high redshift flat spectrum
radio quasars (FSRQs). However, the correlation of VHE spectral index with
source redshift suggests that EBL intensity may be less than what is predicted.
This deviation can draw new constraints on opacity of the universe to VHE
gamma-rays. Therefore, more FSRQs may fall above the sensitivity of the
forthcoming VHE telescopes than the ones predicted by the existing EBL models.
In order to account for the lower EBL intensity predicted by the index-redshift
correlation, we introduce a redshift dependent correction factor to the opacity
estimated from commonly used cosmological EBL model. Considering this modified
opacity, we identify the plausible VHE FSRQ candidates by linearly
extrapolating the \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray spectrum at 10 GeV to VHE regime. Our
study suggests among 744 FSRQs reported in \emph{Fermi} fourth catalog-Data
release 2 (4FGL-DR2), 32 FSRQs will be detectable by Cherenkov Telescope Array

fundamental quantities of the atomic nucleus. From the muonic transition

there have been no established methods to discuss the distribution.
  Purpose: The muonic transition energies for five palladium isotopes with the
mass number $A = 104$, $105$, $106$, $108$ and $110$ were measured. The
procedure to deduce the charge radii and the method to discuss the charge
distribution from the muonic transition energies are proposed.
  Method: The experiment was performed at the MuSIC-M1 beamline at Research
Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University. A continuous muon beam impinged
on the enriched palladium targets. Muonic X rays were measured by high-purity
germanium detectors.
  Results: The muonic transition energies up to $4f$-$3d$ transitions were
determined for five palladium isotopes.
  Discussion and conclusion: The root-mean-square charge radii are deduced
assuming the two-parameter Fermi distribution. The charge distribution of the
nucleus is discussed employing the Barrett model. The muonic transition
energies of the $3d$-$2p$ transitions are crucial to discuss both the charge
radius and the charge distribution.

optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Existing
learning-based TSP methods adopt a simple setting that the training and testing
data are independent and identically distributed. However, the existing
literature fails to solve TSP instances when training and testing data have
different distributions. Concretely, we find that different training and
testing distribution will result in more difficult TSP instances, i.e., the
solution obtained by the model has a large gap from the optimal solution. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we study learning-based TSP methods when
training and testing data have different distributions using adaptive-hardness,
i.e., how difficult a TSP instance can be for a solver. This problem is
challenging because it is non-trivial to (1) define hardness measurement
quantitatively; (2) efficiently and continuously generate sufficiently hard TSP
instances upon model training; (3) fully utilize instances with different
levels of hardness to learn a more powerful TSP solver. To solve these
challenges, we first propose a principled hardness measurement to quantify the
hardness of TSP instances. Then, we propose a hardness-adaptive generator to
generate instances with different hardness. We further propose a curriculum
learner fully utilizing these instances to train the TSP solver. Experiments
show that our hardness-adaptive generator can generate instances ten times
harder than the existing methods, and our proposed method achieves significant
improvement over state-of-the-art models in terms of the optimality gap.

various applications, it is mostly infeasible because of intractable multiple
summations. Spatial Monte Carlo integration (SMCI) is a sampling-based
approximation. It can provide high-accuracy estimations for such intractable
expectations. To evaluate the expectation of a function of variables in a
specific region (called target region), SMCI considers a larger region
containing the target region (called sum region). In SMCI, the multiple
summation for the variables in the sum region is precisely executed, and that
in the outer region is evaluated by the sampling approximation such as the
standard Monte Carlo integration. It is guaranteed that the accuracy of the
SMCI estimator improves monotonically as the size of the sum region increases.
However, a haphazard expansion of the sum region could cause a combinatorial
explosion. Therefore, we hope to improve the accuracy without such an
expansion. In this paper, based on the theory of generalized least squares
(GLS), a new effective method is proposed by combining multiple SMCI
estimators. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated theoretically
and numerically. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective
in the inverse Ising problem (or Boltzmann machine learning).

two different pitch inputs: MIDI pitch sequence or f0 contour. Because the
initial generation of a singing voice is usually executed by taking a MIDI
pitch sequence, one can later extract an f0 contour from the generated singing
voice and modify the f0 contour to a finer level as desired. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we confirmed that the proposed model

that are visible to macroscopic thermodynamic probes but whose microscopic

a handful of f-electron systems, the ordering of odd-rank multipoles leads to
order parameters with a vanishing neutron cross-section. Among them,
Ce$_3$Pd$_{20}$Si$_6$ is known for its unique phase diagram exhibiting two
distinct multipolar-ordered ground states (phases II and II'), separated by a
field-driven quantum phase transition associated with a putative change in the
ordered quadrupolar moment from $O_2^0$ to $O_{xy}$. Using torque magnetometry
at subkelvin temperatures, here we find another phase transition at higher
fields above 12 T, which appears only for low-symmetry magnetic field
directions $\mathbf{B} \parallel \langle11L\rangle$ with $1 < L \leq 2$. While
the order parameter of this new phase II'' remains unknown, the discovery
renders Ce$_3$Pd$_{20}$Si$_6$ a unique material with two field-driven phase
transitions between distinct multipolar phases. They are both clearly
manifested in the magnetic-field dependence of the field-induced (111) Bragg
intensities measured with neutron scattering for $\mathbf{B} \parallel [112]$.
We also find from inelastic neutron scattering that the number of nondegenerate
collective excitations induced by the magnetic field correlates with the number
of phases in the magnetic phase diagram for the same field direction.
Furthermore, the magnetic excitation spectrum suggests that the new phase II''
may have a different propagation vector, revealed by the minimum in the
dispersion that may represent the Goldstone mode of this hidden-order phase.

V361 Hya class of pulsating stars and is spatially close to an extended nebula.
One further star, OW J1819--2729, has characteristics similar to the sdAV
pulsators. In contrast, OW J0815--3421 is a binary star containing an sdB and a
white dwarf with an orbital period of 73.7 min, making it only one of six white
dwarf-sdB binaries with an orbital period shorter than 80 min. Finally, high
cadence photometry of four of the candidate BLAPs show features which we
compare with notch-like features seen in the much longer period Cepheid
pulsators.

nonequilibrium systems. Most strikingly, entirely new states not seen in the
noiseless system can be induced purely by including multiplicative noise - an
effect known as pure noise-induced transitions. It was first observed in
superfluids in the 1980s. Recent results in complex nonequilibrium systems have
also shown how new collective states emerge from such pure noise-induced
transitions, such as the foraging behavior of insect colonies, and schooling in
fish. Here we report such effects of noise in a quantum-mechanical system. We
find that multiplicative quantum noise can induce a classically forbidden
transition. We use a minimal model of a nonlinearly damped oscillator in a
fluctuating environment that is analytically tractable, and whose microscopic
physics can be understood. When environmental noise is included, the system is
seen to transition to a limit-cycle state. The noise-induced quantum limit
cycle exhibits genuine nonclassical traits such as Wigner negativity and
number-parity sensitive circulation in phase space. Such quantum limit cycles
are also conservative. These properties are in stark contrast to those of a
widely used limit cycle in the literature, which is dissipative and loses all
Wigner negativity. Our results establish the existence of a pure noise-induced
transition that is nonclassical and unique to open quantum systems. They
illustrate a fundamental difference between quantum and classical noise.

desirable in many applications such as entertainment systems, monitoring

of pixels per second, however, there is always a trade-off between acquiring
sequences with a high spatial resolution at a low temporal resolution or vice

acquire both a high spatial and a high temporal resolution. This is achieved by
dynamically reading out only a subset of pixels in a non-regular order to
obtain a high temporal resolution. A full high spatial resolution is then
obtained by performing a subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction of the
partially acquired frames. The main benefit of the proposed dynamic readout is
that for each frame, different sampling points are available which is
advantageous since this information can significantly enhance the
reconstruction quality of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Using the
proposed dynamic readout strategy, gains in PSNR of up to 8.55 dB are achieved

$p=0.92\pm 0.06$. If the Solar System's endowment of Neptune-mass objects in

aggregates them according to the contextual information from local and global

modeling to fuse the multi-scale features. Besides, in order to remedy the
spatial feature corruption caused by temporal operations, CSTL incorporates a
salient spatial feature learning (SSFL) module to select groups of

implement the global relation modeling and the SSFL module. To the best of our

gas, dust growth by accretion and coagulation in the dense interstellar medium
(ISM), and shattering in the diffuse ISM. We decompose the grain size
distribution into different dust species depending on the elemental abundances
and the dense ISM fraction given by the simulation. In our previous work, we
focused on Milky Way (MW) analogs and reproduced the observed MW extinction
curve. In this study, we compute dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for
the MW analogues. Our simulated SEDs broadly reproduce the observed MW SED
within their dispersion and so does the observational data of nearby galaxies,
although they tend to underpredict the MW SED at short wavelengths where
emission is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We find that
metallicity and dense gas fraction are the most critical factors for the SED
shape, through their influence on coagulation and shattering.The overall
success of our models in reproducing the MW SED further justifies the dust
evolution processes included in the model and predicts the dispersion in the
SEDs caused by the variety in the assembly history. We also show that the most
significant increase in the dust SED occurs between redshifts $z\sim 3$ and 2
in the progenitors of the simulated MW-like galaxies.

embedding maps high-dimensional sparse user/item features into low-dimensional
dense embeddings. However, these embeddings are usually assigned a unified
dimension, which suffers from the following issues: (1) high memory usage and
computation cost. (2) sub-optimal performance due to inferior dimension
assignments. In order to alleviate the above issues, some works focus on
automated embedding dimension search by formulating it as hyper-parameter
optimization or embedding pruning problems. However, they either require
well-designed search space for hyperparameters or need time-consuming
optimization procedures. In this paper, we propose a Single-Shot Embedding
Dimension Search method, called SSEDS, which can efficiently assign dimensions
for each feature field via a single-shot embedding pruning operation while
maintaining the recommendation accuracy of the model. Specifically, it
introduces a criterion for identifying the importance of each embedding
dimension for each feature field. As a result, SSEDS could automatically obtain
mixed-dimensional embeddings by explicitly reducing redundant embedding
dimensions based on the corresponding dimension importance ranking and the
predefined parameter budget. Furthermore, the proposed SSEDS is model-agnostic,
meaning that it could be integrated into different base recommendation models.
The extensive offline experiments are conducted on two widely used public
datasets for CTR prediction tasks, and the results demonstrate that SSEDS can
still achieve strong recommendation performance even if it has reduced 90\%
parameters. Moreover, SSEDS has also been deployed on the WeChat Subscription
platform for practical recommendation services. The 7-day online A/B test

Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are one of the main candidates for F
production. However, their contribution to the total F budget is not fully
known due to the lack of observations. In this paper, we report the detection
of AlF line emission, one of the two main carriers of F in the gas-phase in the
outflow of evolved stars, towards five nearby oxygen-rich AGB stars, $o$ Ceti,
R Leo, IK Tau, R Dor, and W Hya. From spatially resolved observations, we
estimated the AlF emitting region with a radius $\sim11R_{\star}$ for $o$ Ceti
and $\sim9R_{\star}$ for R Leo. From population diagram analysis, we report the
AlF column densities of $\sim 5.8\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\sim
3\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for $o$ Ceti and R Leo, respectively, within these
regions. For $o$ Ceti, we used the C$^{18}$O ($v=0$, $J=3-2$) observations to
estimate the H$_2$ column density of the emitting region. We found a fractional
abundance of $f_{\rm AlF/H_2}\sim(2.5\pm1.7)\times10^{-8}$. This gives a lower
limit on the F budget in $o$ Ceti and is compatible with the solar F budget
$f_{\rm F/H_2}=(5\pm2)\times10^{-8}$. For R Leo, a fractional abundance $f_{\rm
AlF/H_2}=(1.2\pm0.5)\times10^{-8}$ is estimated. For other sources, we cannot
precisely determine the emitting region based on the available data. Assuming
an emitting region with a radius of $\sim 11R_{\star}$ and the rotational
temperatures derived for $o$ Ceti and R Leo, we crudely approximated the AlF
column density to be $\sim(1.2-1.5)\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ in W Hya,
$\sim(2.5-3.0)\times10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ in R Dor, and
$\sim(0.6-1.0)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ in IK Tau. These result in fractional
abundances within a range of $f_{\rm AlF/H_2}\sim(0.1-4)\times10^{-8}$ in W
Hya, R Dor, and IK Tau.

(conditional) dependence measures between the components of a random vector.
For large dimensions, available estimators are computationally expensive and
can be improved by averaging. Under structural assumptions on the underlying
Kendall's tau and conditional Kendall's tau matrices, we introduce new
estimators that have a significantly reduced computational cost while keeping a
similar error level. In the unconditional setting we assume that, up to
reordering, the underlying Kendall's tau matrix is block-structured with
constant values in each of the off-diagonal blocks. Consequences on the
underlying correlation matrix are then discussed. The estimators take advantage
of this block structure by averaging over (part of) the pairwise estimates in
each of the off-diagonal blocks. Derived explicit variance expressions show
their improved efficiency. In the conditional setting, the conditional
Kendall's tau matrix is assumed to have a constant block structure,
independently of the conditioning variable. Conditional Kendall's tau matrix
estimators are constructed similarly as in the unconditional case by averaging
over (part of) the pairwise conditional Kendall's tau estimators. We establish
their joint asymptotic normality, and show that the asymptotic variance is
reduced compared to the naive estimators. Then, we perform a simulation study
which displays the improved performance of both the unconditional and
conditional estimators. Finally, the estimators are used for estimating the
value at risk of a large stock portfolio; backtesting illustrates the obtained
improvements compared to the previous estimators.

knowledge on the parameters. However, the natural choice of Bayesian inference
can be computationally heavy when relying on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling. When the likelihood of the data is intractable, alternative Bayesian
methods have been proposed. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) only
requires sampling from the data generative model, but may be problematic when
the dimension of the data is high.
  2. We studied alternative strategies to handle high dimensional data in ABC
applied to the calibration of a spatially explicit foraging model for
\textit{Bombus terrestris}. The first step consisted in building a set of
summary statistics carrying enough biological meaning, i.e. as much as the
original data, and then applying ABC on this set. Two ABC strategies, the use
of regression adjustment leading to the production of ABC posterior samples,
and the use of machine learning approaches to approximate ABC posterior
quantiles, were compared with respect to coverage of model estimates and true
parameter values. The comparison was made on simulated data as well as on data
from two field studies.
  3. Results from simulated data showed that some model parameters were easier
to calibrate than others. Approaches based on random forests in general
performed better on simulated data. They also performed well on field data,
even though the posterior predictive distribution exhibited a higher variance.
Nonlinear regression adjustment performed better than linear ones, and the
classical ABC rejection algorithm performed badly.
  4. ABC is an interesting and appealing approach for the calibration of
complex models in biology, such as spatially explicit foraging models. However,
while ABC methods are easy to implement, they require considerable tuning.

paper, we propose CoCoSoDa to effectively utilize contrastive learning for code
search via two key factors in contrastive learning: data augmentation and
negative samples. Specifically, soft data augmentation is to dynamically
masking or replacing some tokens with their types for input sequences to
generate positive samples. Momentum mechanism is used to generate large and
consistent representations of negative samples in a mini-batch through
maintaining a queue and a momentum encoder. In addition, multimodal contrastive
learning is used to pull together representations of code-query pairs and push
apart the unpaired code snippets and queries. We conduct extensive experiments

of mobile devices, the Internet of Things is expanding the amount of mobile
terminals to an enormous level. To deal with such numbers of communication
data, plenty of base stations (BSs) need to be deployed. However, denser
deployments of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) lead to more frequent
handovers, which could increase network burden and degrade the users
experience, especially in traffic hotspot areas. In this paper, we develop a
unified framework to investigate the handover performance of wireless networks
with traffic hotspots. Using the stochastic geometry, we derive the theoretical
expressions of average distances and handover metrics in HetNets, where the
correlations between users and BSs in hotspots are captured. Specifically, the
distributions of macro cells are modeled as independent Poisson point processes
(PPPs), and the two tiers of small cells outside and inside the hotspots are
modeled as PPP and Poisson cluster process (PCP) separately. A modified random
waypoint (MRWP) model is also proposed to eliminate the density wave phenomenon
in traditional models and to increase the accuracy of handover decision. By
combining the PCP and MRWP model, the distributions of distances from a typical
terminal to the BSs in different tiers are derived. Afterwards, we derive the
expressions of average distances from a typical terminal to different BSs, and
reveal that the handover rate, handover failure rate, and ping-pong rate are
deduced as the functions of BS density, scattering variance of clustered small
cell, user velocity, and threshold of triggered time. Simulation results verify
the accuracy of the proposed analytical model and closed-form theoretical
expressions.

efficiently, existing studies have proposed transformations with lower
computational costs to replace the expensive Monte Carlo simulation process.
These alternate transformations, based on network prior knowledge, induce
different search behaviors with similar characteristics to various
perspectives. Specifically, it is difficult for users to determine a suitable
transformation a priori. This article proposes a multi-transformation
evolutionary framework for influence maximization (MTEFIM) with convergence
guarantees to exploit the potential similarities and unique advantages of
alternate transformations and to avoid users manually determining the most
suitable one. In MTEFIM, multiple transformations are optimized simultaneously
as multiple tasks. Each transformation is assigned an evolutionary solver.
Three major components of MTEFIM are conducted via: 1) estimating the potential
relationship across transformations based on the degree of overlap across
individuals of different populations, 2) transferring individuals across
populations adaptively according to the inter-transformation relationship, and
3) selecting the final output seed set containing all the transformation's
knowledge. The effectiveness of MTEFIM is validated on both benchmarks and
real-world social networks. The experimental results show that MTEFIM can
efficiently utilize the potentially transferable knowledge across multiple
transformations to achieve highly competitive performance compared to several
popular IM-specific methods. The implementation of MTEFIM can be accessed at

written as integrals over the truncated two-point correlation function. When
the point process consists of the eigenvalues of a random matrix ensemble,
there are often large $N$ universal forms for this correlation after smoothing,
which results in particularly simple limiting formulas for the fluctuation of
the linear statistics. We review these limiting formulas, derived in the
simplest cases as corollaries of explicit knowledge of the truncated two-point
correlation. One of the large $N$ limits is to scale the eigenvalues so that
limiting support is compact, and the linear statistics vary on the scale of the
support. This is a global scaling. The other, where a thermodynamic limit is
first taken so that the spacing between eigenvalues is of order unity, and then
a scale imposed on the test functions so they are slowly varying, is the bulk
scaling. The latter was already identified as a probe of random matrix
characteristics for quantum spectra in the pioneering work of Dyson and Mehta.

this, it is important to derive a metric that can fairly predict speech
intelligibility for HA users. A straightforward approach is to conduct a
subjective listening test and use the test results as an evaluation metric.
However, conducting large-scale listening tests is time-consuming and
expensive. Therefore, several evaluation metrics were derived as surrogates for
subjective listening test results. In this study, we propose a multi-branched
speech intelligibility prediction model (MBI-Net), for predicting the
subjective intelligibility scores of HA users. MBI-Net consists of two branches
of models, with each branch consisting of a hearing loss model, a cross-domain
feature extraction module, and a speech intelligibility prediction model, to
process speech signals from one channel. The outputs of the two branches are
fused through a linear layer to obtain predicted speech intelligibility scores.
Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of MBI-Net, which produces
higher prediction scores than the baseline system in Track 1 and Track 2 on the
Clarity Prediction Challenge 2022 dataset.

techniques such as data augmentation methods, which generate training samples
that increase the diversity of data and richness of label information. A
popular recent method, mixup, uses convex combinations of pairs of original
samples to generate new samples. However, as we show in our experiments, mixup
can produce undesirable synthetic samples, where the data is sampled off the
manifold and can contain incorrect labels. We propose $\zeta$-mixup, a
generalization of mixup with provably and demonstrably desirable properties
that allows convex combinations of $N \geq 2$ samples, leading to more
realistic and diverse outputs that incorporate information from $N$ original
samples by using a $p$-series interpolant. We show that, compared to mixup,
$\zeta$-mixup better preserves the intrinsic dimensionality of the original
datasets, which is a desirable property for training generalizable models.
Furthermore, we show that our implementation of $\zeta$-mixup is faster than

achievements on non-trivial tasks such as speech recognition and natural

the proliferation of end devices that acted as a catalyst to provide data for
data-hungry DL models. However, computing DL training and inference is the main
challenge. Usually, central cloud servers are used for the computation, but it
opens up other significant challenges, such as high latency, increased
communication costs, and privacy concerns. To mitigate these drawbacks,
considerable efforts have been made to push the processing of DL models to edge
servers. Moreover, the confluence point of DL and edge has given rise to edge
intelligence (EI). This survey paper focuses primarily on the fifth level of
EI, called all in-edge level, where DL training and inference (deployment) are
performed solely by edge servers. All in-edge is suitable when the end devices
have low computing resources, e.g., Internet-of-Things, and other requirements
such as latency and communication cost are important in mission-critical
applications, e.g., health care. Firstly, this paper presents all in-edge
computing architectures, including centralized, decentralized, and distributed.
Secondly, this paper presents enabling technologies, such as model parallelism
and split learning, which facilitate DL training and deployment at edge

conditional computation are described because the standard cloud-based DL
deployment cannot be directly applied to all in-edge due to its limited
computational resources. Fourthly, this paper discusses eleven key performance
metrics to evaluate the performance of DL at all in-edge efficiently. Finally,
several open research challenges in the area of all in-edge are presented.

As for
video semantic segmentation, the contexts include static contexts and motional
contexts, corresponding to static content and moving content in a video clip,
respectively. The static contexts are well exploited in image semantic
segmentation by learning multi-scale and global/long-range features. The
motional contexts are studied in previous video semantic segmentation. However,
there is no research about how to simultaneously learn static and motional
contexts which are highly correlated and complementary to each other. To
address this problem, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining (CFFM)
technique to learn a unified presentation of static contexts and motional
contexts. This technique consists of two parts: coarse-to-fine feature
assembling and cross-frame feature mining. The former operation prepares data
for further processing, enabling the subsequent joint learning of static and
motional contexts. The latter operation mines useful information/contexts from
the sequential frames to enhance the video contexts of the features of the
target frame. The enhanced features can be directly applied for the final
prediction. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that the

Based on this observation, we re-define the goal of line feature tracking:
track two endpoints of a line feature instead of the entire line based on gray
value matching instead of descriptor matching. To achieve this goal, an
efficient two endpoint tracking (TET) method is presented: first, describe a
given line feature with its two endpoints; next, track the two endpoints based
on SOF to obtain two new tracked endpoints by minimizing a pixel-level
grayscale residual function; finally, connect the two tracked endpoints to
generate a new line feature. The correspondence is established between the
given and the new line feature. Compared with current descriptor-based methods,
our TET method needs not to compute descriptors and detect line features
repeatedly. Naturally, it has an obvious advantage over computation.
Experiments in several public benchmark datasets show our method yields highly
competitive accuracy with an obvious advantage over speed.

previous active phase of a subsystem is retained in the memory and leveraged
for parameter learning in its subsequent active and inactive phases. Further, a

explainability. To address these two limitations, we propose robust and
explainable unsupervised autoencoder frameworks that decompose an input time
series into a clean time series and an outlier time series using autoencoders.
Improved explainability is achieved because clean time series are better
explained with easy-to-understand patterns such as trends and periodicities. We
provide insight into this by means of a post-hoc explainability analysis and
empirical studies. In addition, since outliers are separated from clean time

where sensors observe temporal processes and transmit compressed observations
to the Fusion Center (FC). Two types of sensors are considered; one collects
point observations at specific time points while the other collects integral
observations over time intervals. Subsequently, the FC uses the compressed
observations to infer the spatial phenomenon modeled as a binary spatial random
field. We show that the resulting posterior predictive distribution is
intractable and develop a tractable two-step procedure to perform inference.
First, we develop procedures to approximately perform Likelihood Ratio Tests on
the time-series data, for both point sensors and integral sensors, in order to
compress the temporal observations to a single bit. Second, after the
compressed observations are transmitted to the FC, we develop a Spatial Best
Linear Unbiased Estimator (S-BLUE) in order for the FC to reconstruct the
binary spatial random field at an arbitrary spatial location. Finally, we
present a comprehensive study of the performance of the proposed approaches

Design. Tutorial illustrating the key steps for estimating and testing
moderation using observational data. Steps include (1) examining covariate
overlap across treatment groups within levels of the moderator, (2) estimating
the PS weights, (3) evaluating whether PS weights improved covariate balance,
(4) estimating moderated treatment effects, and (5) assessing sensitivity of
findings to unobserved confounding. Our illustrative case study uses data from
41,832 adults from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to examine
if gender moderates the association between sexual minority status (e.g.,
lesbian, gay, or bisexual [LGB] identity) and adult smoking prevalence.
Results. For our case study, there were no noted concerns about covariate
overlap and we were able to successfully estimate the PS weights within each
level of the moderator. Moreover, balance criteria indicated that PS weights
successfully achieved covariate balance for both moderator groups. PS weighted
results indicated there was significant evidence of moderation for the case
study and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results were highly robust for
one level of the moderator but not the other. Conclusions. When conducting
moderation analyses, covariate imbalances across levels of the moderator can
cause biased estimates. As demonstrated in this tutorial, PS weighting within
each level of the moderator can improve the estimated moderation effects by
minimizing bias from imbalance within the moderator subgroups.

neurons are often classified by their morphology. Two recent methods,
persistent homology and the topological morphology descriptor, assign a
morphology descriptor called a barcode to a neuron equipped with a given
function, such as the Euclidean distance from the root of the neuron. These
barcodes can be converted into matrices called persistence images, which can
then be averaged across groups. We show that when the defining function is the
path length from the root, both the topological morphology descriptor and
persistent homology are equivalent. We further show that persistence images
arising from the path length procedure provide an interpretable summary of
neuronal morphology. We introduce {topological morphology functions}, a class
of functions similar to Sholl functions, that can be recovered from the
associated topological morphology descriptor. To demonstrate this topological
approach, we compare healthy cortical and hippocampal mouse neurons to those
affected by progressive tauopathy. We find a significant difference in the
morphology of healthy neurons and those with a tauopathy at a postsymptomatic
age. We use persistence images to conclude that the diseased group tends to
have neurons with shorter branches as well as fewer branches far from the soma.

Therefore, the present study reveals a new and elegant approach to recover the
flow solutions near the wall. Laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate
case is considered for this study in order to explore the ability of PINN to
accurately predict the flow field. All the required sampling data for this
study is obtained from CFD simulations. A wide range of Reynolds number cases
from Re=500 to 100000 has been investigated. First, using PINN, the boundary
layer solution is obtained with three different types of boundary conditions.
Further, the influence of the location of the sampling points on the accuracy
is analysed. From the velocity profiles and the skin friction coefficient
distribution, it is clear that PINN results are reasonably accurate near the
wall with only a few sampling points away from the wall. This approach has
potential application in experiments to obtain the near wall solutions

We derive the magnetoelectric coupling for this system, which leads to a direct

network, where multiple sensors are deployed to infer the state of a linear
time-invariant (LTI) Gaussian system. By proposing a lossless decomposition of
Kalman filter, a framework of event-based distributed estimation is developed,
where each sensor node runs a local filter using solely its own measurement,
alongside with an event-based synchronization algorithm to fuse the neighboring
information. One novelty of the proposed framework is that it decouples the
local filter from synchronization process. By doing so, we prove that a general
class of triggering strategies can be applied in our framework, which yields
stable distributed estimators under the minimal requirements of network
connectivity and collective system observability. As compared with existing
works, the proposed algorithm enjoys lower data size for each transmission.
Moreover, the developed results can be generalized to achieve a distributed
implementation of any Luenberger observer. By solving a semi-definite
programming (SDP), we further present a low-rank estimator design to obtain the
optimal gain of Luenberger observer such that the distributed estimation is
realized under the constraint of message complexity. Numerical examples are
finally provided to demonstrate the proposed methods.

resource theories of non-Gaussianity. As for any resource theory, it is of

systematic numerical investigations, we address the approximate conversion

equivalence was previously known only in the infinite-energy limit. Then we
consider the generation of cat states from photon-added and photon-subtracted

conversions of trisqueezed into cubic-phase states beyond previously reported

detectable (i.e. if our initial state is $|\uparrow_z\rangle$, we need to bias
this with some small amount $\delta$ of state $|\downarrow_z\rangle$). This
biasing, which can be done either directly or via weakly entangling the state
with a pointer, effectively provides a phase reference with which we can
measure the evolution of the state. The outcome can then be measured as a small
probability difference in detections in a mutually unbiased basis, proportional
to this biasing $\delta$. We show this is different from counterfactual
communication, which provably does not require any probe field to travel
between sender Bob and receiver Alice for communication. We further suggest an

  Incorporation of Turn-level Performances","ACL 2022 Main Conference (short paper)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is primarily evaluated using Joint Goal
Accuracy (JGA) defined as the fraction of turns where the ground-truth dialogue
state exactly matches the prediction. Generally in DST, the dialogue state or
belief state for a given turn contains all the intents shown by the user till
that turn. Due to this cumulative nature of the belief state, it is difficult
to get a correct prediction once a misprediction has occurred. Thus, although
being a useful metric, it can be harsh at times and underestimate the true
potential of a DST model. Moreover, an improvement in JGA can sometimes
decrease the performance of turn-level or non-cumulative belief state
prediction due to inconsistency in annotations. So, using JGA as the only
metric for model selection may not be ideal for all scenarios. In this work, we
discuss various evaluation metrics used for DST along with their shortcomings.
To address the existing issues, we propose a new evaluation metric named
Flexible Goal Accuracy (FGA). FGA is a generalized version of JGA. But unlike
JGA, it tries to give penalized rewards to mispredictions that are locally
correct i.e. the root cause of the error is an earlier turn. By doing so, FGA
considers the performance of both cumulative and turn-level prediction flexibly
and provides a better insight than the existing metrics. We also show that FGA
is a better discriminator of DST model performance.

strongest state-of-art baseline (p < 0.001). This is achieved without any

drilling a narrow channel inside the target. These effects significantly alter
the process of $\gamma$-photon generation. Here, we study this process by
importing the outcome of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the target
interaction into particle-in-cell simulations for describing the
$\gamma$-photon generation. It is seen that the background field effect plays
an important positive role, enhancing the efficiency of laser pulse coupling
with the target, and generating high energy electron-positron pairs. It is

  Li, Wei Liu","Tencent Text-Video Retrieval: Hierarchical Cross-Modal Interactions with
  Multi-Level Representations",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Text-Video Retrieval plays an important role in multi-modal understanding and
has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods focus
on constructing contrastive pairs between whole videos and complete caption
sentences, while overlooking fine-grained cross-modal relationships, e.g.,
clip-phrase or frame-word. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named
Hierarchical Cross-Modal Interaction (HCMI), to explore multi-level cross-modal
relationships among video-sentence, clip-phrase, and frame-word for text-video
retrieval. Considering intrinsic semantic frame relations, HCMI performs
self-attention to explore frame-level correlations and adaptively cluster
correlated frames into clip-level and video-level representations. In this way,
HCMI constructs multi-level video representations for frame-clip-video
granularities to capture fine-grained video content, and multi-level text
representations at word-phrase-sentence granularities for the text modality.
With multi-level representations for video and text, hierarchical contrastive
learning is designed to explore fine-grained cross-modal relationships, i.e.,
frame-word, clip-phrase, and video-sentence, which enables HCMI to achieve a
comprehensive semantic comparison between video and text modalities. Further
boosted by adaptive label denoising and marginal sample enhancement, HCMI
achieves new state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, e.g., Rank@1 of
55.0%, 58.2%, 29.7%, 52.1%, and 57.3% on MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, DiDemo, and
ActivityNet, respectively.

presence of overlay journals remains diminutive compared to the overall number
of open access journals. Most overlay journals publish articles in natural
sciences, mathematics or computer sciences, and are commonly published by
groups of academics rather than formal organisations. They may also rank highly
within the traditional journal citation metrics. None of the investigated
journals required fees from authors, which is likely related to the
cost-effective aspects of the overlay publishing model. Both the growth in
adoption of open access preprint repositories and researchers' willingness to
publish in overlay journals will determine the model's wider impact on
scholarly publishing.

Given a category $R$ (which plays the role of the ground field $k$ in classical

for wireless communication networks. Future wireless networks will be composed
of extremely large number of base stations (BSs) and users, and organized in
the form of multiple clusters. Unfortunately, the determination of average
cluster capacity for such future wireless networks is difficult, and lacks of
both analytical expressions and fast algorithms. In this paper, we propose a
fast algorithm TOSE to estimate the average cluster capacity based on the
random matrix theory (RMT). It can avoid the exact eigenvalue derivations of
large dimensional matrices, which are complicated and inevitable in
conventional capacity determination methods. Instead, fast eigenvalue
estimations can be realized based on RMT in our TOSE algorithm. In addition, we
derive the analytical upper and lower bounds of the average cluster capacity.
Our numerical experiments show that TOSE is faster than the conventional
Cholesky decomposition method, by at least three orders of magnitude. Besides,
TOSE has superior generality, since it is independent of the distributions of
BSs and users, and the shape of network areas.

wave power spectrum. In the present work, we track the wall speed and kinetic

those of the 3D simulations, though we find that the spherical simulations are
a poor predictor of the kinetic energy production. This implies that

information from spectrums, which always significantly overfit on speakers or
channels. Considering accent can be regarded as a series of shifts relative to
native pronunciation, distinguishing accents will be an easier task with accent
shift as input. But due to the lack of native utterance as an anchor,
estimating the accent shift is difficult. In this paper, we propose
linguistic-acoustic similarity based accent shift (LASAS) for AR tasks. For an
accent speech utterance, after mapping the corresponding text vector to
multiple accent-associated spaces as anchors, its accent shift could be
estimated by the similarities between the acoustic embedding and those anchors.
Then, we concatenate the accent shift with a dimension-reduced text vector to
obtain a linguistic-acoustic bimodal representation. Compared with pure
acoustic embedding, the bimodal representation is richer and more clear by
taking full advantage of both linguistic and acoustic information, which can
effectively improve AR performance. Experiments on Accented English Speech

accuracy on Test set, obtaining a 6.94% relative improvement over a competitive

voters whose state can change upon a single contact with a different

and, above a certain threshold, these agents become zealots that do not change
opinion. We show that both strategies, normal voters and zealots, may coexist,
leading to a competition between two different kinetic mechanisms:
curvature-driven growth and interfacial noise. The kinetically constrained
zealots are formed well inside the clusters, away from the different opinions
at the surfaces that help keep the confidence not so high. Normal voters
concentrate in a region around the interfaces and their number, that is related
with the distance between the surface and the zealotry bulk, depends on the
rate the confidence changes. Despite this interface being rough and fragmented,
typical of the voter model, the presence of zealots in the bulk of these
domains, induces a curvature-driven dynamics, similar to the low temperature

commonly observed in real world data. We compare the results to
autocorrelation, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis as leading indicator
candidates by a Bayesian model comparison with a linear and a constant model.
We show that the slope of the deterministic term is a promising alternative due
to its quantitative nature and high robustness against noise levels and types.
The commonly computed indicators apart from the autocorrelation with
deseasonalization fail to provide reliable insights into the stability of the
system in contrast to a previously performed study in which the standard
deviation was found to perform best. In addition, we discuss the significant
influence of the seasonal nature of the data to the robust computation of the
various indicators, before we determine approximately the minimal amount of
data per time window that leads to significant trends for the drift slope
estimations.

Direct Sequential Simulation (SDSSIM) framework combines information from
possibly noisy observations, that provide either point information on the model
or are related to the model by a linear averaging kernel, and statistics
derived from a-priori training models. It generates realizations from marginal
posterior probability distributions of model parameters that are not limited to
be Gaussian. We avoid the restriction to Cartesian geometry built into many
existing geostatistical simulation codes, and work instead with grids in
spherical geometry relevant to problems in Earth and Space sciences.
  We demonstrate our scheme using a synthetic example, showing that it produces
realistic posterior realizations consistent with the known solution while
fitting observations within their uncertainty and reproducing the model
parameter distribution and covariance statistics of a-priori training models.
Secondly, we present an application to real satellite observations, estimating
the posterior probability distribution for the geomagnetic field at the
core-mantle boundary. Our results reproduce well-known features of the
core-mantle boundary magnetic field, and also allow probabilistic
investigations of the magnetic field morphology. Small-length scale features in
the posterior realizations are not determined by the observations but match the
covariance statistics extracted from geodynamo simulation training models. The
framework presented here represents a step towards more general approaches to
probabilistic inversion in spherical geometry.

least an order of magnitude higher than in conventional courses. In this paper,
we analyze data from 7 successful MOOCs that have attracted over 150,000

of patches are then processed by a transformer encoder and used for

existing related works focus on fine-tuning the entire representation model,
which inevitably results in much catastrophic forgetting. In the contrast, with
a semantic-rich pre-trained representation model, parameter-additional-tuning
(PAT) only changes very few parameters to learn new visual concepts. Recent
studies have proved that PAT-based CIL can naturally avoid fighting against
forgetting by replaying or distilling like most of the existing methods.
However, we find that PAT-based CIL still faces serious semantic drift, the
high-level forgetting problem caused by classifier learning bias at different
learning phases, which significantly reduces the performance of PAT-based CIL.
To address this problem, we propose Incremental Prototype Tuning (IPT), a
simple but effective method that tunes category prototypes for classification
and learning example prototypes to compensate for semantic drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively compensate for semantic
drift. Combined with well-pre-trained Vit backbones and other PAT methods, IPT
surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines on mainstream incremental learning

  Our main algorithmic result is the first non-trivial guarantee for general

function $\ell$ is non-positive, we prove two inapproximability results,
showing that the algorithmic result implied for this case by previous works is
not far from optimal. Finally, we reanalyze the known Double Greedy algorithm

the linear function $\ell$ is non-negative; and we complement these guarantees

mechanisms which allow them to quickly react to link failures. This paper
revisits the fundamental algorithmic problem underlying such local fast
rerouting mechanisms. Is it possible to achieve perfect resilience, i.e., to
define local routing tables which preserve connectivity as long as the
underlying network is still connected? Feigenbaum et al. (ACM PODC'12) and
Foerster et al. (SIAM APOCS'21) showed that, unfortunately, it is impossible in
general.
  This paper charts a more complete landscape of the feasibility of perfect
resilience. We first show a perhaps surprisingly large price of locality in
static fast rerouting mechanisms: even when source and destination remain
connected by a linear number of link-disjoint paths after link failures, local
rerouting algorithms cannot find any of them which leads to a disconnection on
the routing level. This motivates us to study resilience in graphs which
exclude certain dense minors, such as cliques or a complete bipartite graphs,
and in particular, provide characterizations of the possibility of perfect
resilience in different routing models. We provide further insights into the
price of locality by showing impossibility results for few failures and
investigate perfect resilience on Topology Zoo networks.

holes discovered by LIGO and Virgo is a challenge that spans many areas of
astrophysics, from stellar evolution, dynamics and accretion disks, to possible
exotic early universe processes. Over the final years of their lives,
stellar-mass binaries radiate gravitational waves that are first observable by
space-based detectors (such as LISA) and then ground-based instruments (such as
LIGO, Virgo and the next generation observatories Cosmic Explorer and the
Einstein Telescope). Using state-of-the-art waveform models and
parameter-estimation pipelines for both ground- and space-based observations,
we show that (the expected handful of) these multiband observations will allow
at least percent-level measurements of all 17 parameters that describe the
binary, the possible identification of a likely host galaxy, and the
forewarning of the merger days in advance allowing telescopes at multiple
wavelengths to search for any electromagnetic signature associated to it.
Multiband sources will therefore be a gold mine for astrophysics, but we also

  based on multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit","Submitted to EUSIPCO 2022",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Compressive approaches provide a means of effective channel high resolution
channel estimates in millimeter wave MIMO systems, despite the use of analog
and hybrid architectures. Such estimates can also be used as part of a joint
channel estimation and localization solution. Achieving good localization
performance, though, requires high resolution channel estimates and better
methods to exploit those channels. In this paper, we propose a low complexity
multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit strategy for compressive channel
estimation based by operating with a product of independent dictionaries for
the angular and delay domains, instead of a global large dictionary. This leads
to higher quality channel estimates but with lower complexity than
generalizations of conventional solutions. We couple this new algorithm with a
novel localization formulation that does not rely on the absolute time of
arrival of the LoS path and exploits the structure of reflections in indoor
channels. We show how the new approach is able to operate in realistic 3D
scenarios to estimate the communication channel and locate devices in an indoor
simulation setting.

whether a collective consensus can emerge without these conditions. Here we
introduce a model of interacting agents that strive for consensus, however,

conditions were originally introduced by B. Despr\'es for time-harmonic wave
propagation problems and have largely developed over the past thirty years. The
aim of the paper is to provide both a review of the available formulations and
methods as well as a consistent theory applicable to more general cases than
studied until to date. An abstract variational framework is provided
reformulating the original problem by the well-known form involving a
scattering operator and an interface exchange operator, and the equivalence
between the formulations is discussed thoroughly. The framework applies to a
series of wave propagation problems throughout the de Rham complex, such as the
scalar Helmholtz equation, Maxwell's equations, a dual formulation of the
Helmholtz equation in H(div), as well as any conforming finite element
discretization thereof, and it applies also to coercive problems. Three
convergence results are shown. The first one (using compactness) and the second
one (based on absorbtion) generalize Despr\'es' early findings and apply as
well to the FETI-2LM formulation. The third result, oriented on the work by
Collino, Ghanemi, and Joly, establishes a convergence rate and covers cases
with cross points, while not requiring any regularity of the solution. The key
ingredient is a global interface exchange operator, proposed originally by X.
Claeys and further developed by Claeys and Parolin, here worked out in full
generality. The third type of convergence theory is applicable at the discrete
level as well, where the exchange operator is allowed to be even local. The
resulting scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the 2-Lagrange-multiplier
method introduced by S. Loisel, and connections are drawn to another technique
proposed by Gander and Santugini.

absorption feature observed in a variety of dense astronomical environments
including young stellar objects and molecular clouds. We focus on the low-mass
post-AGB star Sakurai's Object which has been forming substantial quantities of
carbonaceous dust since an eruptive event in the 1990s. Large melilite grains
cannot be responsible for the 6.9-micron absorption feature because the
similarly-shaped feature in the laboratory spectrum was produced by very low
(0.1 per cent by mass) carbonate contamination which was not detected at other
wavelengths. Due to the high band-strength of the 6.9-micron feature in
carbonates, we conclude that carbonates carry the astronomical 6.9~micron
feature. Replacement of melilite with carbonates in models of Sakurai's object
improves fits to the 6 - 7-micron Spitzer spectra without significantly
altering other conclusions of Bowey's previous models except that there is no
link between the feature and the abundance of melilite in meteorites. With
magnesite (MgCO3), the abundance of 25-micron-sized SiC grains is increased by
10 - 50 per cent and better constrained. The mass of carbonate dust is similar
to the mass of PAH dust. Existing experiments suggest carbonates are stable
below 700~K, however it is difficult to ascertain the applicability of these
experiments to astronomical environments and more studies are required.

understanding of the systematic noise and the causal structure of the
data-generating process. Our algorithm is based on a modified version of
half-sibling regression (HSR), a flexible denoising framework that combines
ideas from the fields of machine learning and causality. We adapt the method to
address the specific requirements of high-contrast exoplanet imaging data
obtained in pupil tracking mode. The key idea is to estimate the systematic
noise in a pixel by regressing the time series of this pixel onto a set of
causally independent, signal-free predictor pixels. We use regularized linear
models in this work; however, other (non-linear) models are also possible. In a
second step, we demonstrate how the HSR framework allows us to incorporate
observing conditions such as wind speed or air temperature as additional
predictors. When we apply our method to four data sets from the VLT/NACO
instrument, our algorithm provides a better false-positive fraction than
PCA-based PSF subtraction, a popular baseline method in the field.
Additionally, we find that the HSR-based method provides direct and accurate
estimates for the contrast of the exoplanets without the need to insert
artificial companions for calibration in the data sets. Finally, we present
first evidence that using the observing conditions as additional predictors can
improve the results. Our HSR-based method provides an alternative, flexible and
promising approach to the challenge of modeling and subtracting the stellar PSF
and systematic noise in exoplanet imaging data.

deeper circuits at the expense of a nontrivial density of errors. In this work,
we obtain extremely tight limitation bounds for standard NISQ proposals in both

$L=\mathcal{O}(p^{-1})$ it is exponentially unlikely that the outcome of a
noisy quantum circuit outperforms efficient classical algorithms for
combinatorial optimization problems like Max-Cut. Although previous results
already showed that classical algorithms outperform noisy quantum circuits at
constant depth, these results only held for the expectation value of the

tower type since their proofs rely on the regularity lemma. Let $B_{k,n}$ be

sharing a common $K_k$, and let $H=K_p(a_1,\dots,a_{p})$ be the complete

  Recently, avoiding use of the regularity lemma, Fox, He and Wigderson (2021)
revisit several Ramsey goodness results involving books. They comment that it
would be very interesting to see how far one can push these ideas. In
particular, they conjecture that for all integers $k, p, t\ge 2$, there exists
some $\delta>0$ such that for all $n\ge 1$, $1\leq a_1\le\cdots\le a_{p-1}\le
t$ and $a_p \le \delta n$, we have $r(H, B_{k,n})=
(p-1)(n-1)+d_k(n,K_{a_1,a_2})+1,$ where $d_k(n,K_{a_1,a_2})$ is the maximum $d$
for which there is an $(n+d-1)$-vertex $K_{a_1,a_2}$-free graph in which at
most $k-1$ vertices have degree less than $d$.They verify the conjecture when
$a_1=a_2=1$.
  Building upon the work of Fox et al. (2021), we make a substantial step by
showing that the conjecture ""roughly"" holds if $a_1=1$ and $a_2|(n-1-k)$, i.e.
$a_2$ divides $n-1-k$. Moreover, avoiding use of the regularity lemma, we prove
that for every $k, a\geq 1$ and $p\ge2$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that for
all large $n$ and $b\le \delta\ln n$, $r(K_p(1,a,b,\dots,b), B_{k,n})=
(p-1)(n-1)+k(p-1)(a-1)+1$ if $a|(n-1-k)$, where the case when $a=1$ has been
proved by Nikiforov and Rousseau (2009) using the regularity lemma. The bounds
on $1/\delta$ we obtain are not of tower-type since our proofs do not rely on

In the case of two minimal projections in a von Neumann algebra, this
correspond to the usual transition probability. We prove that every bijective
transformation $\Phi$ preserving triple transition pseudo-probabilities between
the lattices of tripotents of two atomic JBW$^*$-triples $M$ and $N$ admits an
extension to a bijective {\rm(}complex{\rm)} linear mapping between the socles
of these JBW$^*$-triples. If we additionally assume that $\Phi$ preserves
orthogonality, then $\Phi$ can be extended to a surjective (complex-)linear
{\rm(}isometric{\rm)} triple isomorphism from $M$ onto $N$. In case that $M$
and $N$ are two spin factors or two type 1 Cartan factors we show, via
techniques and results on preservers, that every bijection preserving triple
transition pseudo-probabilities between the lattices of tripotents of $M$ and
$N$ automatically preserves orthogonality, and hence admits an extension to a
triple isomorphism from $M$ onto $N$.

presented, with particular attention to universal conductance features, which
reveal the existence of two electronic subsystems. The overall electronic
system consists of $1+p$ charges, where $p$ is the doping. At low dopings
exactly one hole is localized per planar copper-oxygen unit, while upon
increasing doping and temperature, the hole is gradually delocalized and
becomes itinerant. Remarkably, the itinerant holes exhibit identical
Fermi-liquid character across the cuprate phase diagram. This universality
enables a simple count of carrier density and yields comprehensive
understanding of the key features in the normal and superconducting state. A
possible superconducting mechanism is presented, compatible with the key
experimental facts. The base of this mechanism is the interaction of fast
Fermi-liquid carriers with localized holes. A change in the microscopic nature
of chemical bonding in the copper-oxide planes, from ionic to covalent, is
invoked to explain the phase diagram of these fascinating compounds.

considerable difficulties. This is the case of Social Networks such as Twitter,
an ever-changing stream of information written with informal and complex

by humans given the important role that context plays. Addressing tasks in this
domain through Natural Language Processing involves severe challenges. When
powerful state-of-the-art multilingual language models are applied to this
scenario, language specific nuances use to get lost in translation. To face
these challenges we present \textbf{BERTuit}, the larger transformer proposed
so far for Spanish language, pre-trained on a massive dataset of 230M Spanish
tweets using RoBERTa optimization. Our motivation is to provide a powerful
resource to better understand Spanish Twitter and to be used on applications
focused on this social network, with special emphasis on solutions devoted to
tackle the spreading of misinformation in this platform. BERTuit is evaluated
on several tasks and compared against M-BERT, XLM-RoBERTa and XLM-T, very
competitive multilingual transformers. The utility of our approach is shown
with applications, in this case: a zero-shot methodology to visualize groups of
hoaxes and profiling authors spreading disinformation.
  Misinformation spreads wildly on platforms such as Twitter in languages other
than English, meaning performance of transformers may suffer when transferred

knowledge from a well-trained source model to a related but unlabeled target

source data fail. To combat this challenge, existing USFDAs turn to transfer
knowledge by aligning the target feature to the latent distribution hidden in
the source model. However, such information is naturally limited. Thus, the
alignment in such a scenario is not only difficult but also insufficient, which
degrades the target generalization performance. To relieve this dilemma in
current USFDAs, we are motivated to explore a new perspective to boost their
performance. For this purpose and gaining necessary insight, we look back upon
the origin of the domain adaptation and first theoretically derive a new-brand
target generalization error bound based on the model smoothness. Then,
following the theoretical insight, a general and model-smoothness-guided
Jacobian norm (JN) regularizer is designed and imposed on the target domain to
mitigate this dilemma. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate its
effectiveness. In its implementation, just with a few lines of codes added to

monitoring the quality of students' independent performance of tasks. The
results of the experiment prove that it is necessary to provide teachers and
students with computer equipment, Internet access, digital resources for

performed by students can be monitored in the virtual office of the teacher and
shape an individual trajectory of students' development. The teachers
identified the following main problems of DLF implementation: internet

some teachers; lack of state aid in providing EER to all participants in the
educational process; limited access to students' computers during complete

photorealistic target view images. Finally, the rendering results in uncertain,
occluded and unreferenced regions can be further improved by incorporating a

that the variation in the shape of their dust attenuation curves is driven
primarily by their structure, i.e., distribution of stars (and dust) within
them. The attenuation curve for spheroid dominated galaxies, as compared to the
disc dominated ones, is nearly twice as steep. Both structural types cover
distinct ranges of attenuation slope values. Similar findings are reflected in
the case of star-forming and passive galaxies. Spheroids and passive galaxies
witness minimal attenuation in the optical compared to UV wavelengths
underlining the lack of dusty birth-clouds that define complex star-dust
geometry. The distinction in the attenuation properties of spheroids and discs
is maintained in each stellar mass range emphasising that structure is the
primal cause of variation. However, within a structural group, the attenuation
curve becomes shallower with both the increase in total stellar mass and
optical depth of the galaxy. Overall, with the extinction curve fixed to be the
same for all galaxies, the star-dust geometry emerges to be the prime
determinant of the variation in their attenuation properties.

prove a folk theorem for this setting that provides sufficient conditions for
ex post efficiency, and thus represents a model of ideal cooperation between
agents without a third-party mediator. Connecting our framework with the
literature on strategic information revelation, we explore cases where
conditional disclosure can be used to achieve full cooperation while
unconditional disclosure cannot. Finally, extending previous work on program
equilibrium, we develop an implementation of conditional information
disclosure. We show that this implementation forms program $\epsilon$-Bayesian
Nash equilibria corresponding to the Bayesian Nash equilibria of these

limited amount of foresight. Ewerton et al. attain their best performance using
an agent which only takes the most immediate action under consideration. We are
interested in the ability of their models and training algorithms to accurately
predict long-term Q-Values. To evaluate this ability, we design a new bin
sorting task and reward function. Our task requires agents to accurately
estimate future rewards and therefore use high discount factors in their
Q-Value calculation. We investigate the behaviour of an adaptation of the VPG
training algorithm on our task. We show that this adaptation can not accurately
predict the required long-term action sequences. In addition to the limitations
identified by Ewerton et al., it suffers from the known Deep Q-Learning problem
of overestimated Q-Values. In an effort to solve our task, we turn to the
Hourglass models and combine them with the Double Q-Learning approach. We show
that this approach enables the models to accurately predict long-term action

Double Q-Learning technique is essential for training with very high discount
factors, as the models Q-Value predictions diverge otherwise. We also
experiment with different approaches for discount factor scheduling, loss

geometrically symmetric macroscopic samples. In this Letter, we show that
matter chirality breaks mirror symmetry of the scattered electrons quantum
decoherence, even when the incident electron wave function and the sample shape

wave function transverse smearing triggers electron sensitivity to the spatial
asymmetry of the electromagnetic interaction with the sample, as results from
our non-perturbative analysis of the scattered electron reduced density matrix,
in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. Furthermore, we prove

investigate the formation of BHs in the PI mass gap via star -- star collisions
in young stellar clusters. To avoid PI, the stellar-collision product must have
a relatively small core and a massive envelope. We generate our initial
conditions from the outputs of a hydro-dynamical simulation of the collision
between a core helium burning star ($\sim 58$ M$_\odot$) and a main-sequence
star ($\sim 42$ M$_\odot$). The hydro-dynamical simulation allows us to take
into account the mass lost during the collision ($\sim 12$ M$_\odot$) and to
build the chemical composition profile of the post-collision star. We then
evolve the collision product with the stellar evolution codes PARSEC and MESA.
We find that the post-collision star evolves through all the stellar burning
phases until core collapse, avoiding PI. At the onset of core collapse, the
post-collision product is a blue super-giant star. We estimate a total mass
loss of about 1 M$_\odot$ during the post-collision evolution, due to stellar
winds and shocks induced by neutrino emission in a failed supernova. The final
BH mass is $\approx{87}$ M$_\odot$. Therefore, we confirm that the collision
scenario is a suitable formation channel to populate the PI mass gap.

massive black holes could be produced by the collision of an evolved star with
a carbon-oxygen core and a main sequence star. Such a post-coalescence star
could end its life avoiding the pair-instability regime and with a direct
collapse of its very massive envelope. It is still not clear, however, how the
collision shapes the structure of the newly produced star and how much mass is
actually lost in the impact. We investigated this issue by means of
hydrodynamical simulations with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code {\sc
StarSmasher}, finding that a head-on collision can remove up to 12\% of the
initial mass of the colliding stars. This is a non-negligible percentage of the
initial mass and could affect the further evolution of the stellar remnant,
particularly in terms of the final mass of a possibly forming black hole. We
also found that the main sequence star can plunge down to the outer boundary of
the core of the primary, changing the inner chemical composition of the
remnant. The collision expels the outer layers of the primary, leaving a
remnant with an helium-enriched envelope (reaching He fractions of about 0.4 at
the surface). These more complex abundance profiles can be directly used in
stellar evolution simulations of the collision product.

Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on
diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance
matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this
encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming
amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,|
\psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density
matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first
show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the
dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to
argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with
$\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a
covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance
matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For
uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called ""PCA without centering"",
which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely
corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that
bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of
standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and
meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state
datasets.

become attractive due to large Hund's exchange $J$. This is possible in
multiorbital systems even when all local bare interactions are repulsive, since
attraction in specific channels are given by certain linear combinations of
interaction parameters. On the other hand, pairing processes such as the
exchange of spin fluctuations, are also present. We compare these two
mechanisms on an equal footing using electronic bands appropriate for different
classes of multiorbital systems over a wide range of interaction parameters. We
find that for systems without clear nesting features, the superconducting state
generated by the Hund's mechanism agrees well with that from the full
fluctuation exchange vertex when Hund's exchange and spin-orbit coupling are
sufficiently large. On the other hand, for systems characterized by a peaked
finite-momentum particle-hole susceptibility, spin-fluctuation pairing
generally dominates over Hund's pairing. We conclude that Hund's pairing states

Combined with the designed vehicle planning and control algorithm, the
unsignalized intersection management strategy consists of two parts: the
heuristic priority queues based right of way allocation (HPQ) algorithm, and
the vehicle planning and control algorithm. In the HPQ algorithm, a vehicle
priority management model considering the difference between CAVs and CHVs is
built to design the right of way management for CAVs and CHVs, respectively. In

Non-renormalisable kinetic mixing in the gauge sector or a Higgs portal are not
required to connect the dark sector to the SM. We introduce instead a
Vector-Like (VL) fermion doublet of $SU(2)_D$, the members of which are
singlets of the SM Electro-Weak (EW) gauge group, which mediates the

Portal Vector DM (FPVDM) allows multiple realisations, depending on the
properties of the the VL partner and the scalar potential. As a practical
example, here, we discuss in detail a realisation involving a VL top partner
assuming no mixing between the two scalars of the theory. We then provide
bounds from collider and astroparticle observables. The origin of the

a dark EW sector or through an underlying composite structure. The new class of
FPVDM models we suggest here has a large number of phenomenological
applications depending on the mediator properties and can be used for collider

diverse set of tasks to unseen tasks from the same task distribution with a
limited amount of labeled data. The underlying requirement for effective
few-shot generalization is to learn a good representation of the task manifold.
This becomes more difficult when only a limited number of tasks are available
for training. In such a few-task few-shot setting, it is beneficial to
explicitly preserve the local neighborhoods from the task manifold and exploit
this to generate artificial tasks for training. To this end, we introduce the
notion of interval bounds from the provably robust training literature to
few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to characterize neighborhoods
around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can then be preserved by
minimizing the distance between a task and its respective bounds. We then use a
novel strategy to artificially form new tasks for training by interpolating
between the available tasks and their respective interval bounds. We apply our
framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based
metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident

  with compression",,,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are interesting alternatives for
building the on-chip Last-Level Cache (LLC). Their advantages, compared to SRAM
memory, are higher density and lower static power, but each write operation
slightly wears out the bitcell, to the point of losing its storage capacity. In
this context, this paper proposes a novel NV-LLC organization leveraging data
compression. Data compression reduces the size of the blocks and, together with
wear-leveling mechanisms, can defer the degradation of such a NV-LLC. Moreover,
as capacity is reduced by write wear, data compression enables degraded cache
frames to allocate blocks whose compressed size is adequate.
  From a methodological point of view, although different approaches are used
in the literature to analyze the degradation of a NV-LLC, none of them allows
to study in detail its temporal evolution. In this sense, this work proposes a
forecasting procedure that combines detailed simulation and prediction,
enabling an accurate analysis of different cache content mechanisms
(replacement, wear leveling, compression, etc.) on the temporal evolution of
the indices of interest, such as the effective capacity of the NV-LLC or the
system IPC.
  The proposed NV-LLC organization has a small added cost compared to that of a
baseline NV-LLC without compression in terms of area, latency and energy
consumption, and increases more than 6 times the time a NV-LLC takes to reach
50% effective capacity.

warp pixels from the inputs to the desired interpolation instant. Yet due to
the inherent challenges of motion estimation (e.g. occlusions and
discontinuities), most state-of-the-art interpolation approaches require
subsequent refinement of the warped result to generate satisfying outputs,
which drastically decreases the efficiency for multi-frame interpolation. In
this work, we propose a fully differentiable Many-to-Many (M2M) splatting
framework to interpolate frames efficiently. Specifically, given a frame pair,
we estimate multiple bidirectional flows to directly forward warp the pixels to
the desired time step, and then fuse any overlapping pixels. In doing so, each
source pixel renders multiple target pixels and each target pixel can be
synthesized from a larger area of visual context. This establishes a
many-to-many splatting scheme with robustness to artifacts like holes.
Moreover, for each input frame pair, M2M only performs motion estimation once
and has a minuscule computational overhead when interpolating an arbitrary
number of in-between frames, hence achieving fast multi-frame interpolation. We
conducted extensive experiments to analyze M2M, and found that it significantly
improves efficiency while maintaining high effectiveness.

ObjectGoal Navigation (e.g. 'find & go to a chair') and (2) Pick&Place (e.g.

virtual teleoperation data-collection infrastructure -- connecting Habitat

users to teleoperate virtual robots, safely and at scale. We collect 80k
demonstrations for ObjectNav and 12k demonstrations for Pick&Place, which is an
order of magnitude larger than existing human demonstration datasets in
simulation or on real robots.
  Second, we attempt to answer the question -- how does large-scale imitation
learning (IL) (which hasn't been hitherto possible) compare to reinforcement
learning (RL) (which is the status quo)? On ObjectNav, we find that IL (with no
bells or whistles) using 70k human demonstrations outperforms RL using 240k
agent-gathered trajectories. The IL-trained agent demonstrates efficient
object-search behavior -- it peeks into rooms, checks corners for small
objects, turns in place to get a panoramic view -- none of these are exhibited
as prominently by the RL agent, and to induce these behaviors via RL would
require tedious reward engineering. Finally, accuracy vs. training data size
plots show promising scaling behavior, suggesting that simply collecting more
demonstrations is likely to advance the state of art further. On Pick&Place,
the comparison is starker -- IL agents achieve ${\sim}$18% success on episodes
with new object-receptacle locations when trained with 9.5k human
demonstrations, while RL agents fail to get beyond 0%. Overall, our work
provides compelling evidence for investing in large-scale imitation learning.

acquisition process is an important tool to study the effect of object motion.
It is natural in this context to rely on a voxel-to-voxel difference metric
between the original image and its motion-simulated version to quantify the
alteration. These metrics are very sensitive to any mis-coregistration between
the two images. As we observed global displacements of the corrupted image for
specific simulated motions, we focused this work on the critical choice of a
reference position of the object for the motion simulation that avoids any
global displacement. Methods: We used the motion simulation framework and we
studied the different proposed solutions. Classically, the position around the
k-space center is considered as a reference with two analytical solutions to
correct for global image shifts: demeaning the image in the Fourier domain
either using the exact position at k-space center or using a weighted average
around the center.
  Results: We demonstrated with motion simulated examples that these analytical
solutions did not yield the same results as a direct co-registration method.
Indeed, short transitions around the k-space center did not induce any global
displacement, in contrast with what both analytical solutions assumed. We also
observed a dependence of the global shift to both the motion amplitude and the
translation direction. Conclusion: In the absence of a theoretical solution, we
concluded that an extra co-registration step after motion simulation was needed
in order to compare the simulation with its reference image.

unnoticed by the experts and to accurately segment the detected polyps during
interventions. Although state-of-the-art models are proposed, it remains a
challenge to define representations that are able to generalize well and that
mediate between capturing low-level features and higher-level semantic details
without being redundant. Another challenge with these models is that they
require too many parameters, which can pose a problem with real-time
applications. To address these problems, we propose PlutoNet for polyp
segmentation which requires only 2,626,537 parameters, less than 10\% of the
parameters required by its counterparts. With PlutoNet, we propose a novel
\emph{decoder consistency training} approach that consists of a shared encoder,
the modified partial decoder which is a combination of the partial decoder and
full-scale connections that capture salient features at different scales
without being redundant, and the auxiliary decoder which focuses on
higher-level relevant semantic features. We train the modified partial decoder
and the auxiliary decoder with a combined loss to enforce consistency, which
helps improve the encoders representations. This way we are able to reduce
uncertainty and false positive rates. We perform ablation studies and extensive
experiments which show that PlutoNet performs significantly better than the
state-of-the-art models, particularly on unseen datasets and datasets across
different domains.

disease diagnosis, two constraints were designed in our model which can improve
the model's sensitivity and specificity by up to 9.32% and 10.21%,

Yet, thus far, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding about
transferability-based attacks (""transfer attacks"") in real-world environments.
  To bridge this critical gap, we conduct the first large-scale systematic
empirical study of transfer attacks against major cloud-based MLaaS platforms,
taking the components of a real transfer attack into account. The study leads
to a number of interesting findings which are inconsistent to the existing
ones, including: (1) Simple surrogates do not necessarily improve real transfer
attacks. (2) No dominant surrogate architecture is found in real transfer
attacks. (3) It is the gap between posterior (output of the softmax layer)
rather than the gap between logit (so-called $\kappa$ value) that increases
transferability. Moreover, by comparing with prior works, we demonstrate that
transfer attacks possess many previously unknown properties in real-world
environments, such as (1) Model similarity is not a well-defined concept. (2)
$L_2$ norm of perturbation can generate high transferability without usage of
gradient and is a more powerful source than $L_\infty$ norm. We believe this
work sheds light on the vulnerabilities of popular MLaaS platforms and points
to a few promising research directions.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is currently considered at the industrial
level for robotic vision. LiDAR is an imaging technique that monitors pulses of
light at optical frequencies to sense the space and to recover
three-dimensional ranging information. Notwithstanding the efforts on LiDAR

deflectors cascaded with large area metasurfaces to achieve large FoV and
simultaneous peripheral and central imaging zones. This technology achieves MHz

functional electronics. Especially, compounds semiconductor membranes such as
III-N and III-V offer great opportunities for optoelectronics, high-power
electronics, and high-speed computing. Despite huge efforts to produce such
membranes by detaching epitaxial layers from donor wafers, however, it is still
challenging to harvest epitaxial layers using practical processes. Here, we
demonstrate a method to grow and harvest multiple epitaxial membranes with
extremely high throughput at the wafer scale. For this, 2D materials are
directly formed on III-N and III-V substrates in epitaxy systems, which enables
an advanced remote epitaxy scheme comprised of multiple alternating layers of
2D materials and epitaxial layers that can be formed by a single epitaxy run.
Each epilayer in the multi-stack structure is then harvested by layer-by-layer
peeling, producing multiple freestanding membranes with unprecedented
throughput from a single wafer. Because 2D materials allow peeling at the
interface without damaging the epilayer or the substrate, wafers can be reused
for subsequent membrane production. Therefore, this work represents a
meaningful step toward high-throughput and low-cost production of
single-crystal membranes that can be heterointegrated.

  User Dependency",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In the last decade, information diffusion (also known as information cascade)
on social networks has been massively investigated due to its application
values in many fields. In recent years, many sequential models including those
models based on recurrent neural networks have been broadly employed to predict
information cascade. However, the user dependencies in a cascade sequence
captured by sequential models are generally unidirectional and inconsistent
with diffusion trees. For example, the true trigger of a successor may be a
non-immediate predecessor rather than the immediate predecessor in the
sequence. To capture user dependencies more sufficiently which are crucial to
precise cascade modeling, we propose a non-sequential information cascade model
named as TAN-DRUD (Topology-aware Attention Networks with Dual Role User
Dependency). TAN-DRUD obtains satisfactory performance on information cascade
modeling through capturing the dual role user dependencies of information
sender and receiver, which is inspired by the classic communication theory.
Furthermore, TANDRUD incorporates social topology into two-level attention
networks for enhanced information diffusion prediction. Our extensive
experiments on three cascade datasets demonstrate that our model is not only
superior to the state-of-the-art cascade models, but also capable of exploiting
topology information and inferring diffusion trees.

foundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association
football. Most existing models of football player motion have not been
validated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is
that performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of
player motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable
positions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football
players typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of
actually reachable positions.
  This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that
measures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all
possibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of
reachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a
manually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four
different motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion
with constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed
limit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show
that assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a
limit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate
distinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two
segments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the
tested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of
real-world player motion.
