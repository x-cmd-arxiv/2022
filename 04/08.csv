a more coarse specification with the goal to omit unnecessary details while
preserving important aspects. While recent work on abstraction in the situation
calculus has focused on non-probabilistic domains, we describe an approach to
abstraction of probabilistic and dynamic systems. Based on a variant of the
situation calculus with probabilistic belief, we define a notion of
bisimulation that allows to abstract a detailed probabilistic basic action
theory with noisy actuators and sensors by a possibly non-stochastic basic
action theory. By doing so, we obtain abstract Golog programs that omit
unnecessary details and which can be translated back to a detailed program for
actual execution. This simplifies the implementation of noisy robot programs,
opens up the possibility of using non-stochastic reasoning methods (e.g.,
planning) on probabilistic problems, and provides domain descriptions that are
more easily understandable and explainable.

  2022",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Industrial arms need to evolve beyond their standard shape to embrace new and
emerging technologies. In this paper, we shall first perform an analysis of
four popular but different modern industrial robot arms. By seeing the common
trends we will try to extrapolate and expand these trends for the future. Here,
particular focus will be on interaction based on augmented reality (AR) through
head-mounted displays (HMD), but also through smartphones. Long-term
human-robot interaction and personalization of said interaction will also be
considered. The use of AR in human-robot interaction has proven to enhance
communication and information exchange. A basic addition to industrial arm
design would be the integration of QR markers on the robot, both for accessing
information and adding tracking capabilities to more easily display AR
overlays. In a recent example of information access, Mercedes Benz added QR
markers on their cars to help rescue workers estimate the best places to cut
and evacuate people after car crashes. One has also to deal with safety in an
environment that will be more and more about collaboration. The QR markers can
therefore be combined with RF-based ranging modules, developed in the
EU-project SafeLog, that can be used both for safety as well as for tracking of
human positions while in close proximity interactions with the industrial arms.
The industrial arms of the future should also be intuitive to program and
interact with. This would be achieved through AR and head mounted displays as
well as the already mentioned RF-based person tracking. Finally, a more
personalized interaction between the robots and humans can be achieved through
life-long learning AI and disembodied, personalized agents. We propose a design
that not only exists in the physical world, but also partly in the digital
world of mixed reality.

compact shield designs, conventionally, lead is used. Metallic tungsten and
tungsten pseudo-alloys reach higher densities up to 19.3 gcm$^{-3}$ and do not
exhibit a significant $^{210}$Pb activity, which is a typical intrinsic

able to identify tungsten samples with activities similar or better than 1
mBqkg$^{-1}$ in $^{232}$Th, $^{40}$K, $^{60}$Co and the second part of the
$^{238}$U decay chain. In cooperation with a manufacturer we further reduced a
persisting contamination in the first part of the $^{238}$U decay chain by a
factor of $\sim$2.5 down to (305$\pm$30) mBqkg$^{-1}$. With Monte Carlo
simulations, the construction of prototype tungsten-based setups and dedicated
measurements, the shield capability of tungsten in comparison to lead was
extensively studied. Specifically, the impact of cosmogenic radiation on the
background at shallow depth was investigated. We showed that a 6-40% reduction
(depending on the exact shield configuration) in the muon-induced neutron
fluence is achievable by replacing lead with an equivalent amount of tungsten
regarding the suppression of external $\gamma$-radiation. Overall, many
benefits using tungsten especially for low energy applications below a few 100

good agreement between cloud-free models and dayside thermal emission, but an
overestimation of the nightside flux, for which clouds have been suggested as a
possible explanation. We use the temperature and vertical wind structure from
the cloud-free 3D general circulation models of Kataria et al. and post-process
it using PICASO, assuming that clouds form and affect the spectra. We compare
our models to results from Kataria et al., including Hubble Space Telescope

recover the cloud-free results, even though PICASO utilizes a coarse spatial

strong admissibility is the key concept underlying grounded semantics, as
membership of a strongly admissible set is sufficient to show membership of the

used as an explanation of membership of the grounded extension, as is for
instance done in some of the proof procedures for grounded semantics. In the
current paper, we present two polynomial algorithms for constructing relatively
small strongly admissible labellings, with associated min-max numberings, for a
particular argument. These labellings can be used as relatively small
explanations for the argument's membership of the grounded extension. Although
our algorithms are not guaranteed to yield an absolute minimal strongly
admissible labelling for the argument (as doing do would have implied an
exponential complexity), our best performing algorithm yields results that are
only marginally bigger. Moreover, the runtime of this algorithm is an order of
magnitude smaller than that of the existing approach for computing an absolute
minimal strongly admissible labelling for a particular argument. As such, we
believe that our algorithms can be of practical value in situations where the
aim is to construct a minimal or near-minimal strongly admissible labelling in

are costly and impose significant latencies on transaction processing, which
rules out their usage in responsive high-performance data management systems.
  In this work, we improve on this situation by introducing the
Proof-of-Execution consensus protocol (PoE), a consensus protocol designed for
high-performance low-latency resilient data management. PoE introduces
speculative execution, which minimizes latencies by starting execution before
consensus is reached, and PoE introduces proof-of-executions to guarantee
successful execution to clients. Furthermore, PoE introduces a single-round
check-commit protocol to reduce the overall communication costs of consensus.
Hence, we believe that PoE is a promising step towards flexible general-purpose
low-latency resilient data management systems.

alternating current stimulation (tACS) is currently a part of the standard
procedure to predict and understand neural response. Quasi-static approximation
for electric field calculations is generally applied to reduce the
computational cost. Here, we aimed to analyze and quantify the validity of the
approximation over a broad frequency range. Approach: We performed
electromagnetic modeling studies using an anatomical head models and considered
approximations assuming either a purely ohmic medium (i.e., static formulation)
or a lossy dielectric medium (quasi-static formulation). The results were
compared with the solution of Maxwell's equations in the cases of harmonic and
pulsed signals. Finally, we analyzed the effect of electrode positioning on
these errors. Main Results: Our findings demonstrate that the quasi-static
approximation is valid and produces a relative error below 1% up to 1.43 MHz.
The largest error is introduced in the static case, where the error is over 1%
across the entire considered spectrum and as high as 20% in the brain at 10 Hz.
We also highlight the special importance of considering the capacitive effect
of tissues for pulsed waveforms, which prevents signal distortion induced by
the purely ohmic approximation. At the neuron level, the results point a
difference of sense electric field as high as 22% at focusing point, impacting
pyramidal cells firing times. Significance: Quasi-static approximation remains
valid in the frequency range currently used for tACS. However, neglecting
permittivity (static formulation) introduces significant error for both
harmonic and non-harmonic signals. It points out that reliable low frequency
dielectric data are needed for accurate tCS numerical modeling.

ubiquitous in mobile apps for many years due to its role in supporting
advertising-based revenue models. In response, Apple introduced two significant
changes with iOS 14: App Tracking Transparency (ATT), a mandatory opt-in system
for enabling tracking on iOS, and Privacy Nutrition Labels, which disclose what
kinds of data each app processes. So far, the impact of these changes on
individual privacy and control has not been well understood. This paper
addresses this gap by analysing two versions of 1,759 iOS apps from the UK App
Store: one version from before iOS 14 and one that has been updated to comply
with the new rules.
  We find that Apple's new policies, as promised, prevent the collection of the
Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier for cross-app tracking.
Smaller data brokers that engage in invasive data practices will now face
higher challenges in tracking users - a positive development for privacy.
However, the number of tracking libraries has roughly stayed the same in the
studied apps. Many apps still collect device information that can be used to
track users at a group level (cohort tracking) or identify individuals
probabilistically (fingerprinting). We find real-world evidence of apps
computing and agreeing on a fingerprinting-derived identifier through the use
of server-side code, thereby violating Apple's policies. We find that Apple
itself engages in some forms of tracking and exempts invasive data practices
like first-party tracking and credit scoring. We also find that the new Privacy
Nutrition Labels are sometimes inaccurate and misleading.
  Overall, our findings suggest that, while tracking individual users is more
difficult now, the changes reinforce existing market power of gatekeeper
companies with access to large troves of first-party data and motivate a
countermovement.

fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the past two decades, various
constructions of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) have been developed,
leading to many good code families. However, the majority of these codes are
not suitable for near-term quantum devices. Here we present VarQEC, a
noise-resilient variational quantum algorithm to search for quantum codes with
a hardware-efficient encoding circuit. The cost functions are inspired by the
most general and fundamental requirements of a QECC, the Knill-Laflamme
conditions. Given the target noise channel (or the target code parameters) and
the hardware connectivity graph, we optimize a shallow variational quantum
circuit to prepare the basis states of an eligible code. In principle, VarQEC
can find quantum codes for any error model, whether additive or non-additive,
degenerate or non-degenerate, pure or impure. We have verified its
effectiveness by (re)discovering some symmetric and asymmetric codes, e.g.,
$((n,2^{n-6},3))_2$ for $n$ from 7 to 14. We also found new $((6,2,3))_2$ and
$((7,2,3))_2$ codes that are not equivalent to any stabilizer code, and
extensive numerical evidence with VarQEC suggests that a $((7,3,3))_2$ code
does not exist. Furthermore, we found many new channel-adaptive codes for error
models involving nearest-neighbor correlated errors. Our work sheds new light
on the understanding of QECC in general, which may also help to enhance
near-term device performance with channel-adaptive error-correcting codes.

decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with low cost and minimal invasiveness. Two
prominent imaging paradigms, FreeSurfer (FS) and Advanced Normalization Tools
(ANTs), feature multiple pipelines for extracting region-specific eCT
measurements from raw MRI, but the sheer complexity of these pipelines makes it
difficult to choose between pipelines, compare results between pipelines, and
characterize uncertainty in pipeline estimates. Worse yet, the EC is
particularly difficult to image, leading to variations in thickness estimates
between pipelines that overwhelm physiologicl variations predictive of AD. We
examine the eCT outputs of seven different pipelines on MRIs from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Because of both theoretical and
practical limitations, we have no gold standard by which to evaluate them.
Instead, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model to combine the estimates. The
resulting posterior distribution yields high-probability idealized eCT values
that account for inherent uncertainty through a flexible multivariate error
model that supports different constant offsets, standard deviations,
tailedness, and correlation structures between pipelines. Our hierarchical
model directly relates idealized eCTs to clinical outcomes in a way that
propagates eCT estimation uncertainty to clinical estimates while accounting
for longitudinal structure in the data. Surprisingly, even though it
incorporates greater uncertainty in the predictor and regularization provided
by the prior, the combined model reveals a stronger association between eCT and
cognitive capacity than do nonhierarchical models based on data from single
pipelines alone.

between the electromagnetic and gravitational variables already to first order
in the perturbations. The equations governing these perturbations are found by
using the Ricci identities, the Bianchi identities, Einstein's field equations,
Maxwell's equations, particle conservation, and a form of energy-momentum
conservation for the plasma components. Using a $1+1+2$ covariant split of
spacetime, the studied quantities and equations are decomposed with respect to
the preferred directions on the background spacetimes. After linearizing the
decomposed equations around a LRS background, performing a harmonic
decomposition, and imposing the cold magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit with a
finite electrical resistivity, the system is then reduced to a set of ordinary
differential equations in time and some constraints. On solving for some of the
harmonic coefficients in terms of the others, the system is found to decouple
into two closed and independent subsectors. Through numerical calculations, we
then observe some mechanisms for generating magnetic field perturbations,
showing some traits similar to previous works using FLRW backgrounds.
Furthermore, beat-like patterns are observed in the short wave length limit due
to interference between gravitational waves and plasmonic modes.

fluid is transported by its area preserving flow. Given an initial vorticity
distribution $\omega_0$, predicting the long time behavior which can persist is
an issue of fundamental importance. In the infinite time limit, some
irreversible mixing of $\omega_0$ can occur. Since kinetic energy $\mathsf{E}$
is conserved, not all the mixed states are relevant and it is natural to
consider only the ones with energy $\mathsf{E}_0$ corresponding to $\omega_0$.
The set of said vorticity fields, denoted by
$\overline{\mathcal{O}_{\omega_0}}^*\cap \{ {\mathsf E}= {\mathsf E}_0\}$,
contains all the possible end states of the fluid motion. A. Shnirelman
introduced the concept of maximally mixed states (any further mixing would
necessarily change their energy), and proved they are perfect fluid equilibria.
We offer a new perspective on this theory by showing that any minimizer of any
strictly convex Casimir in $\overline{\mathcal{O}_{\omega_0}}^*\cap \{ {\mathsf
E}= {\mathsf E}_0\}$ is maximally mixed, as well as discuss its relation to
classical statistical hydrodynamics theories. Thus, (weak) convergence to
equilibrium cannot be excluded solely on the grounds of vorticity transport and
conservation of kinetic energy. On the other hand, on domains with symmetry
(e.g. straight channel or annulus), we exploit all the conserved quantities and
the characterizations of $\overline{\mathcal{O}_{\omega_0}}^*\cap \{ {\mathsf
E}= {\mathsf E}_0\}$ to give examples of open sets of initial data which can be
arbitrarily close to any shear or radial flow in $L^1$ of vorticity but do not
weakly converge to them in the long time limit.

behavior of a robot, it is often tedious to use on a real robotic system. On an
actual robot, the user needs to consider low-level details, such as enabling
and disabling hardware components, e.g., a camera to detect objects for
grasping. In other words, high-level actions usually pose implicit temporal
constraints on the low-level platform, which are typically independent of the
concrete program to be executed. In this paper, we propose to make these
constraints explicit by modeling them as MTL formulas, which enforce the
execution of certain low-level platform operations in addition to the main
program. Based on results from timed automata controller synthesis, we describe
a method to synthesize a controller that executes both the high-level program
and the low-level platform operations concurrently in order to satisfy the MTL

energy and duality defects in the Ising CFT using the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) technique. We show that the EE for the duality
defect exhibits fundamentally different characteristics compared to the energy
defect due to the existence of localized and delocalized zero energy modes. Of
special interest is the nontrivial `finite-size correction' in the EE obtained
recently using free fermion computations. These corrections arise when the
subsystem size is appreciable compared to the total system size and lead to a
deviation from the usual logarithmic scaling characteristic of one-dimensional
quantum-critical systems. Using matrix product states with open and infinite
boundary conditions, we numerically demonstrate the disappearance of the zero
mode contribution for finite subsystem sizes in the thermodynamic limit. Our
results provide further support to the recent free fermion computations, but
clearly contradict earlier analytical field theory calculations based on
twisted torus partition functions. Subsequently, we compute the logarithm of
the EN (log-EN) between two disjoint subsystems separated by a defect. We show
that the log-EN scales logarithmically with the separation of the subsystems.
However, the coefficient of this logarithmic scaling yields a
continuously-varying effective central charge that is different from that
obtained from analogous computations of the EE. The defects leave their
fingerprints in the subleading term of the scaling of the log-EN. Furthermore,
the log-EN receives similar `finite size corrections' like the EE which leads
to deviations from its characteristic logarithmic scaling.

applying a proper transformation to density function of certain continuous

The tractability of analytical expression of normal distribution, and

A central object in this analysis is a notion of fourth order energy,
previously analysed by the authors, which is subject to a positive energy
theorem. We show that this energy can be more geometrically rewritten in terms
of a fourth order analogue to the Ricci tensor, which we denote by $J_g$. This
allows us to prove that Yamabe positive $J$-flat AE manifolds must be isometric
to Euclidean space. As a by product, we prove that this $J$-tensor provides a
geometric control for the optimal decay rates at infinity. This last result
reinforces the analogy of $J$ as a fourth order analogue to the Ricci tensor.

Contrastive Learning (UniCL) with a single learning objective to seamlessly
prompt the synergy of two data types. Extensive experiments show that our UniCL
is an effective way of learning semantically rich yet discriminative
representations, universally for image recognition in zero-shot, linear-probe,
fully finetuning and transfer learning scenarios. Particularly, it attains
gains up to 9.2% and 14.5% in average on zero-shot recognition benchmarks over
the language-image contrastive learning and supervised learning methods,
respectively. In linear probe setting, it also boosts the performance over the
two methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Our study also indicates that UniCL
stand-alone is a good learner on pure image-label data, rivaling the supervised

impact of instrumental calibration errors (CEs) and uncertainties on luminosity
distance measurements, $D_L$, and the inferred $H_0$ results. We simulate
binary neutron star mergers (BNSs), as detected by a network of Advanced LIGO
and Advanced Virgo interferometers at their design sensitivity. We artificially
add CEs equal to exceptionally large values experienced in LIGO-Virgo's third
observing run (O3). We find that for individual BNSs at a network
signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the systematic errors on $D_L$ - and hence $H_0$ -
are still smaller than the statistical uncertainties. The biases become more
significant when we combine multiple events to obtain a joint posterior on
$H_0$. In the rather unrealistic case that the data around each detection is
affected by the same CEs corresponding to the worst offender of O3, the true
$H_0$ value would be excluded from the 90% credible interval after $\sim40$
sources. If instead 10% of the sources suffer from severe CEs, the true value
of $H_0$ is included in the 90% credible interval even after we combine 100
sources.

metropolitan area, there are two conflicting principles: 1) the healthy
competition between multiple platforms, such as between Uber and Lyft in the
United States, and 2) economies of network scale, which leads to higher chances
for trips to be matched, and thus higher operation efficiency, but which also
implies monopoly. The current shared mobility markets, as observed in different
cities in the world, are either monopolistic, or largely segmented by multiple
platforms, the latter with significant efficiency loss. How to keep the
competition between platforms, but to reduce the efficiency loss due to
segmentation with new market designs is the focus of this paper. We first
propose a theoretical framework of shared mobility market segmentation and then
propose four market structure designs thereupon. The framework and four designs
are first discussed as an abstract model, without losing generality, thus not
constrained to any specific city. High-level perspectives and detailed
mechanisms for each proposed market structure are both examined. Then, to
assess the real-world performance of these market structure designs, we used a
ride-sharing simulator with real-world ride-hailing trip data from New York
City to simulate. The proposed market designs can reduce the total
vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) by 6\% while serving more customers with 8.4\%
fewer total number of trips. In the meantime, customers receive better services
with on-average 5.4\% shorter waiting time. At the end of the paper, the
feasibility of implementation for each proposed market structure is discussed.

Universe, we adopt a theoretical framework where the standard model emerges as
a Poincar\'e invariant field theory localized at a domain-antidomain wall
(DW-aDW) brane pair of a theory which lives on a higher dimensional bulk. We
argue that such a system of a parallel DW-aDW pair could have been created at a
very early epoch of the cosmological evolution when the Universe was still of
microscopic size because its creation is topologically possible as compared to
a single DW creation when the perpendicular extra dimension is compact. The
conservation laws, such as of charge and chirality, are not violated in vacuum
fluctuations of the combined DW-aDW system, but as we show their simultaneous
conservation for each wall separately may not be favorable in certain
processes. In particular, as expansion of spacetime occurs in the higher
dimensional bulk, the distance d between the DW and the aDW increases as a
function of time. We show that during the early stages of the cosmological
evolution, when d was of microscopic size, the leading mechanism for
pair-creation from fluctuations of the gauge-field with polarization
perpendicular to the DWs (i.e., polarization along the extra dimension) was one
in which the particle and the antiparticle were created on the opposite
domain-walls hosting opposite chirality fermions. This mechanism allows for a
matter-antimatter asymmetry to appear separately in the DW and the aDW, while
in the combined DW-aDW system no such asymmetry was allowed. In this scenario,
at a later and the present stage of the cosmological evolution, where d is
macroscopically large, the probability to violate these conservation laws on a
single DW, as a function of the inter-wall distance, is exponentially
suppressed.

temperature and high density by focusing on the probability distribution
function, which represents the probability that a certain density will be
realized in a heat bath. The probability distribution function is obtained by
creating a canonical partition function fixing the number of particles from the
grand partition function. However, if the Z_3 center symmetry, which is
important for understanding the finite temperature phase transition of SU(3)
lattice gauge theory, is maintained on a finite lattice, the probability
distribution function is always zero, except when the number of particles is a
multiple of 3. For U(1) lattice gauge theory, this problem is more serious. The
probability distribution becomes zero when the particle number is nonzero. This
problem is essentially the same as the problem that the expectation value of
the Polyakov loop is always zero when calculating with finite volume. In this
study, we propose a solution to this problem. We also propose a method to avoid
the sign problem, which is an important problem at finite density, using the
center symmetry. In the case of U(1) lattice gauge theory with heavy fermions,
numerical simulations are actually performed, and we demonstrate that the
probability distribution function at a finite density can be calculated by the

galaxy clusters is the continued energy input from the central active galactic
nucleus (AGN) of the cluster. However, it remains unclear how this energy is
thermalised so that it can effectively prevent global thermal instability. One
possible option is that a fraction of the AGN energy is converted into cosmic
rays (CRs), which provide non-thermal pressure support, and can retain energy
even as thermal energy is radiated away. By means of magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations, we investigate how CR injected by the AGN jet influence cooling
flows of a massive galaxy cluster. We conclude that converting a fraction of
the AGN luminosity as low as 10\% into CR energy prevents cooling flows on
timescales of billion years, without significant changes in the structure of
the multi-phase intra-cluster medium. CR-dominated jets, by contrast, lead to
the formation of an extended, warm central nebula that is supported by CR
pressure. We report that the presence of CRs is not able to suppress the onset
of thermal instability in massive galaxy clusters, but CR-dominated jets do
significantly change the continued evolution of gas as it continues to cool
from isobaric to isochoric. The CR redistribution in the cluster is dominated
by advection rather than diffusion or streaming, but the heating by CR
streaming helps maintain gas in the hot and warm phase. Observationally,
self-regulating, CR-dominated jets produce a \gammaray~ flux in excess of
current observational limits, but low CR fractions in the jet are not ruled
out.

improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity.
Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation

cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In
this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a
model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal
amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous
model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the ""barn
spider"" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by
introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such
performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization
techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for
ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and
samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice
performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying
a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on
INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889
when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those

recover AGN in dwarfs with strong emission lines (SELs), we present a
classification scheme optimizing the use of existing optical diagnostics. We
use SDSS emission-line catalogs overlapping the volume- and mass-limited
RESOLVE and ECO surveys to determine the AGN percentage in SEL dwarfs. Our
photoionization grids show that the [O III]/H$\beta$ versus [S II]/H$\alpha$

differences in spectral fitting methodologies between catalogs. The highly
complete nature of RESOLVE and ECO allows us to normalize strong emission-line
galaxy statistics to the full galaxy population, reducing the dwarf AGN

for autonomous driving and is an economical alternative to expensive depth
sensors like LiDAR. The temporal photometric constraints enables
self-supervised depth estimation without labels, further facilitating its
application. However, most existing methods predict the depth solely based on
each monocular image and ignore the correlations among multiple surrounding
cameras, which are typically available for modern self-driving vehicles. In
this paper, we propose a SurroundDepth method to incorporate the information
from multiple surrounding views to predict depth maps across cameras.
Specifically, we employ a joint network to process all the surrounding views
and propose a cross-view transformer to effectively fuse the information from
multiple views. We apply cross-view self-attention to efficiently enable the
global interactions between multi-camera feature maps. Different from
self-supervised monocular depth estimation, we are able to predict real-world
scales given multi-camera extrinsic matrices. To achieve this goal, we adopt
the two-frame structure-from-motion to extract scale-aware pseudo depths to
pretrain the models. Further, instead of predicting the ego-motion of each
individual camera, we estimate a universal ego-motion of the vehicle and
transfer it to each view to achieve multi-view ego-motion consistency. In
experiments, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the
challenging multi-camera depth estimation datasets DDAD and nuScenes.

approaching the problem from an orthogonal angle: exploiting self-attention
mechanisms with both ""spatial tokens"" and ""channel tokens"". With spatial
tokens, the spatial dimension defines the token scope, and the channel
dimension defines the token feature dimension. With channel tokens, we have the
inverse: the channel dimension defines the token scope, and the spatial

linear complexity of the entire model. We show that these two self-attentions
complement each other: (i) since each channel token contains an abstract

global interactions and representations by taking all spatial positions into
account when computing attention scores between channels; (ii) the spatial
attention refines the local representations by performing fine-grained

solidification of Sn-5 wt pct Pb alloy from the Hebditch and Hunt experiment is
taken. Applied forcing of convective flow is determined by the dimensionless
electromagnetic forcing parameter $F$. The study was carried out in the range
$-3.5\times 10^6<F<3.5\times 10^6$. Velocity profiles and flow patterns in the
liquid phase are obtained for different applied EM forcing conditions. As a
result of parametric analysis, the dependence of the Reynolds number on the
electromagnetic forcing parameter was obtained. Electromagnetic forces can
significantly affect the flow in the liquid bulk, increasing and slowing down
the velocity, as well as changing the circulating flow direction. Solute
concentration distribution analysis has shown that EM-forced convection does
not affect global solute segregation formation. For the two cases, segregation
channels were obtained. However, the analysis of the global segregation index
showed that an increase in the Reynolds number provokes a slight decrease in
this parameter. The main mechanism of segregation formation is transport of
solute rich liquid into the mushy zone. In considered numerical experiment
configuration, the penetration into the mushy zone is not large, and even a
change in the direction of convection in the liquid bulk does not significantly
affect the mushy zone flow. The calculations were made by means of open source

observations so far could not confirm this expectation due to limited
statistics. The picture is further complicated by the possible effects of
quasar outflows (i.e. feedback) that could either suppress or stimulate the
star formation rate (SFR) of companion galaxies, thus modifying the expected
bias. Here we quantify feedback effects on the properties and detectability of
companions by comparing cosmological zoom-in simulations of a quasar in which
feedback is either included or turned-off. With respect to the no-feedback
case, companions (a) directly impacted by the outflow have their SFR increased
by a factor $2-3$, and (b) tend to be more massive. Both effects shift the
[CII]158$\mu$m and UV luminosity functions toward brighter magnitudes. This
leads us to conclude that quasar feedback slightly increases the effective
quasar bias, boosting the number density of observable quasar companions, in
agreement with what has been found around the brightest quasars of recent ALMA
[CII] surveys. Deeper observations performed with JWST and/or ALMA will improve
the statistical significance of this result by detecting a larger number of

the fractional charge of the quasiparticles in the fractional quantum Hall

must spontaneously break the symmetry and display a local order parameter. In
this paper, we study the phase diagram and anyon condensation transitions of a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order perturbed by Ising interactions in the Toric
Code. The interplay between the global Ising symmetry and the lattice space
group symmetries results in a non-trivial symmetry fractionalization class for
the anyons, and is shown to lead to two characteristically different
symmetry-broken phases. To understand the anyon condensation transitions, we
use the recently introduced critical torus energy spectrum technique to
identify a line of emergent 2+1D XY* transitions ending at a fine-tuned
(Ising$^2$)* critical point. We provide numerical evidence for the occurrence
of two symmetry breaking patterns predicted by the specific symmetry
fractionalization class of the anyons in the explored phase diagram. In
combination with quantum Monte Carlo simulations we measure unusually large
critical exponents for the scaling of the correlation function at the anyon
condensation transitions, and we identify lines of (weakly) first order
transitions in the phase diagram. As an important result, we discuss the phase
diagram of a resulting 2+1D Ashkin-Teller model, where we demonstrate that
torus spectroscopy is capable of identifying emergent XY/O(2) critical
behaviour, thereby solving some longstanding open questions in the domain of
the 3D Ashkin-Teller models. To establish the generality of our results, we
propose a field theoretical description which is in excellent agreement with

in a particular scattering channel. Based on the Poincare and gauge symmetries
of scattering amplitude, we construct the j-basis using the Casimir method for
both the Lorentz and gauge sectors. The quantum numbers of the j-basis
operators fix the quantum numbers of any intermediate state in the
corresponding amplitudes, such as a UV resonance. This can be re-interpreted as
the j-basis/UV correspondence, thus obtaining the j-bases in all partitions of
fields for an operator amounts to finding all of its UV origins at tree level,
constituting the central part of the bottom-up EFT framework. Applying the

work in galaxies of any mass. As fainter and less massive galaxies, however,
dwarf galaxies are particularly susceptible to environmental mechanisms that
can more easily perturb these systems. Importantly, the presence of nearby
large galaxies are expected to have a profound effect on dwarf galaxies.
Gravitational (especially tidally-induced) effects from the large galaxy can
cause mass to be lost from the dwarf, and the passage of the dwarf through the
gaseous medium surrounding the large galaxy can additionally cause the dwarf to
lose its own gas through a process called ram pressure stripping. Such effects
are considered to be the main sources of difference between ""satellite"" and
""field"" dwarf galaxy populations. Here, we report on new observations of the
gaseous content of Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM), an archetype of isolated,
gas-rich field dwarf galaxies in the Local Universe, which shows a much more
complex situation. Previous studies of its gaseous disk suggest it has
perturbed kinematics; here, we identify four trailing, extended gas clouds in
the opposite direction to WLM's spatial motion, as well as a spatial offset
between the WLM gas and stars. Overall, the morphology and kinematics of this
gas shows that WLM is undergoing ram pressure stripping, despite being 930 and
830 kpc from the Milky Way and M31, respectively. This finding indicates the
presence of an inter-galactic, gaseous reservoir far from large galaxies whose
evolutionary role on galaxies, both large and small, may not be fully

density drops by a factor of 200$-$500 inside the gas cavity, which could be
due to a massive companion of several M$_{\mathrm{J}}$. The broad dust-depleted

work demonstrates that knowledge of the gas temperature is important to
determine the gas surface density and thus whether planets, and if so what kind
of planets, are the most likely carving the dust cavities.

physical and chemical processes in the interstellar medium. Cosmic rays are a
significant source of energy in star formation regions, which impacts the
physical and chemical processes which drive the formation of stars. Previous
studies of the circum-molecular zone (CMZ) of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 have
found evidence for a high CRIR value; $10^3-10^6$ times the average cosmic ray
ionization rate within the Milky Way. This is a broad constraint and one goal
of this study is to determine this value with much higher precision. We exploit
ALMA observations towards the central molecular zone of NGC 253 to measure the
CRIR. We first demonstrate that the abundance ratio of H$_3$O$^+$ and SO is
strongly sensitive to the CRIR. We then combine chemical and radiative transfer
models with nested sampling to infer the gas properties and CRIR of several
star-forming regions in NGC 253 due to emission from their transitions. We find
that each of the four regions modelled has a CRIR in the range
$(1-80)\times10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ and that this result adequately fits the
abundances of other species that are believed to be sensitive to cosmic rays
including C$_2$H, HCO$^+$, HOC$^+$, and CO. From shock and PDR/XDR models, we
further find that neither UV/X-ray driven nor shock dominated chemistry are a
viable single alternative as none of these processes can adequately fit the
abundances of all of these species.

the graviton mass can be computed explicitly, and we explain how it directly

the existence of quantum extremal islands at zero temperature is highly
constrained, also when the dilaton is allowed to vary, so that the mass of the

identify a critical parameter, above and below which islands still exist but

Runge-Kutta finite volume (RK-FV) scheme for which the space-time region is
partitioned by approximate characteristics with zero velocity. The high-order
spatial reconstruction is achieved using the recently developed weighted
essentially non-oscillatory schemes with adaptive order (WENO-AO); and the
high-order temporal accuracy is achieved by explicit RK methods for convection
equations and implicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods for convection-diffusion
equations. Our algorithm extends to higher dimensions via dimensional
splitting. Numerical experiments demonstrate our algorithm's robustness,
high-order accuracy, and ability to handle extra large time steps.

solar system. Associated with enormous plasma ejections and energy release,
CMEs have an important impact on the solar-terrestrial environment. Accurate
predictions of the arrival times of CMEs at the Earth depend on the precise
measurements on their three-dimensional velocities, which can be achieved using
simultaneous line-of-sight (LOS) and plane-of-sky (POS) observations. Besides
the POS information from routine coronagraph and extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
imaging observations, spectroscopic observations could unveil the physical
properties of CMEs including their LOS velocities. We propose that spectral
line asymmetries measured by Sun-as-a-star spectrographs can be used for
routine detections of CMEs and estimations of their LOS velocities during their
early propagation phases. Such observations can also provide important clues
for the detection of CMEs on other solar-like stars. However, few studies have
concentrated on whether we can detect CME signals and accurately diagnose CME
properties through Sun-as-a-star spectral observations. In this work, we
constructed a geometric CME model and derived the analytical expressions for
full-disk integrated EUV line profiles during CMEs. For different CME
properties and instrumental configurations, full disk-integrated line profiles
were synthesized. We further evaluated the detectability and diagnostic
potential of CMEs from the synthetic line profiles. Our investigations provide
important constraints on the future design of Sun-as-a-star spectrographs for
CME detections through EUV line asymmetries.

strategic, adaptive, and, more importantly, iterative in nature. Despite the
success of large language models on text revision tasks, they are limited to
non-iterative, one-shot revisions. Examining and evaluating the capability of
large language models for making continuous revisions and collaborating with
human writers is a critical step towards building effective writing assistants.
In this work, we present a human-in-the-loop iterative text revision system,
Read, Revise, Repeat (R3), which aims at achieving high quality text revisions
with minimal human efforts by reading model-generated revisions and user
feedbacks, revising documents, and repeating human-machine interactions. In R3,
a text revision model provides text editing suggestions for human writers, who
can accept or reject the suggested edits. The accepted edits are then
incorporated into the model for the next iteration of document revision.
Writers can therefore revise documents iteratively by interacting with the
system and simply accepting/rejecting its suggested edits until the text
revision model stops making further revisions or reaches a predefined maximum
number of revisions. Empirical experiments show that R3 can generate revisions
with comparable acceptance rate to human writers at early revision depths, and
the human-machine interaction can get higher quality revisions with fewer
iterations and edits. The collected human-model interaction dataset and system
code are available at \url{https://github.com/vipulraheja/IteraTeR}. Our system

derive constraints on their imaginary and real parts. We then move to a
comprehensive comparison with experimental results. We show that, by fitting a
single Wilson coefficient, the deviations from the Standard Model are at the
$4.7\sigma$ level when including only the hadronic insensitive observables
while it increases to $6.1\sigma$ when including also the hadronic sensitive
ones. When switching on all relevant Wilson coefficients and combining both
hadronic sensitive and insensitive data into the fit, the deviation from the
Standard Model peaks at $7.2\sigma$ and decreases at the $4.9\sigma$ level if
we assume that the central values of $R_K$ and $R_{K^{\ast}}$ are taken to be
unity. We further estimate other unaccounted for SM contributions and show that
their inclusion still requires New Physics to fit the data. We then introduce
the $g-2$ lepton anomalies as well as the most recent $W$-mass results.
Different theoretical models are considered that can explain the discrepancies
from the Standard Model. In the final part of our work we estimate the impact
of the forthcoming data from LHCb (coming from LHC Run3) and Belle II, when it
will have accumulated about $5~ab^{-1}$.

in distributed phased arrays via local broadcast of the node electrical states.
Frequency and phase synchronization between nodes in a distributed array is
necessary to support beamforming, but due to the operational dynamics of the
local oscillators of the nodes, the frequencies and phases of their output
signals undergo the random drift and jitter in between the update intervals.
Furthermore, frequency and phase estimation errors contribute to the total
phase errors, leading to a residual phase error in the array that degrades
coherent operation. Recently, a classical decentralized frequency and phase
synchronization algorithm based on consensus averaging was proposed with which
the standard deviation of the residual phase errors upon convergence was
reduced to $10^{-4}$ degrees for internode update intervals of $0.1$ ms,
however this was obtained for arrays with at least $400$ nodes and a high
connectivity ratio of $0.9$. In this paper, we propose a message passing based
average consensus (MPAC) algorithm to improve the synchronization of the
electrical states of the nodes in distributed arrays. Simulation results show
that the proposed MPAC algorithm significantly reduces the residual phase
errors to about $10^{-11}$ degrees, requiring only $20$ moderately connected
nodes in an array. Furthermore, MPAC converges faster than the DFPC-based
algorithms, particularly for the larger arrays with a moderate connectivity.

lattice light-sheet microscopy to quantitatively explore the 3D morphodynamics
of migrating T cells at high spatiotemporal resolution. We first developed a
new shape descriptor based on spherical harmonics, incorporating key
polarisation information of the uropod. We found that the shape space of T
cells is low-dimensional. At the behavioural level, run-and-stop migration
modes emerge at ~150 s, and we mapped the morphodynamic composition of each
mode using multiscale wavelet analysis, finding 'stereotyped' motifs. Focusing
on the run mode, we found morphodynamics oscillating periodically (every ~100
s) that can be broken down into a biphasic process: front-widening with
retraction of the uropod, followed by a rearward surface motion and forward
extension, where intercalation with the ECM in both of these steps likely
facilitates forward motion. Further application of these methods may enable the
comparison of T cell migration across different conditions (e.g.
differentiation, activation, tissues, and drug treatments), and improve the

additional scalar doublet, in which the non-SM scalars can enhance $W$-boson
mass via the loop corrections. On the other hand, with a proper discrete
symmetry, the lightest new scalar in the doublet can be stable and play the
role of dark matter particle. We show that the inert two Higgs doublet model
can naturally handle the new $W$-boson mass without violating other

Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network
classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model
parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its
centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of
features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster
to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes
away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective
function that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their
corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This
methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces
the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are
pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to,
effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an
adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative
method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2)
anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity
training. Gravity's efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding
fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD

technologies. However, TI systems can have a limited number of qubits in a
single trap. Execution of meaningful quantum algorithms requires a multiple
trap system. In such systems, the computation may frequently involve ions from
two different traps for which the qubits must be co-located in the same trap,
hence one of the ions needs to be shuttled (moved) between traps, increasing
the vibrational energy, degrading fidelity, and increasing the program
execution time. The choice of initial mapping influences the number of
shuttles. The existing Greedy policy counts the number of gates occurring
between each pair of qubits and assigns edge weight. The qubits with high edge
weights are placed close to each other. However, it neglects the stage of the
program at which the gate is occurring. Intuitively, the contribution of the
late-occurring gates to the initial mapping reduces since the ions might have
already shuttled to a different trap to satisfy other gate operations. In this
paper, we target this gap and propose a new policy especially for programs with
considerable depth and high number of qubits (valid for practical-scale quantum
programs). Our policy is program adaptive and prioritizes the gates
re-occurring at the initial stages of the program over late occurring gates.
Our technique achieves an average reduction of 9% shuttles/program (with 21.3%
at best) for 120 random circuits and enhances the program fidelity up to 3.3X
(1.41X on average).

their exclusive signature as polarization-dependent azimuthal intensity lobes

Hall effect) and its reciprocal effect as the wave vector-controlled spin
selection of quasiguided modes (inverse spin Hall effect). These effects are
separately manifested in characteristic Mueller matrix elements enabling their
interpretation as geometrical circular anisotropy effects. Resonance-enabled
enhancement and control of these effects are also demonstrated by exploiting
the spectral Fano-type resonance. The far-field manifestation of
spin-directional excitation of leaky quasiguided modes, their unique

including vertical settling of icy/rocky grains, radial drift of solids,
planetesimal formation, as well as planetary accretion itself -- are
facilitated by hydrodynamic interactions between H/He gas and high-$Z$ dust.
The Stokes number, which quantifies the strength of dust-gas coupling, thus
plays a central role in protoplanetary disk evolution, and its poor
determination constitutes an important source of uncertainty within the theory
of planet formation. In this work, we present a simple model for dust-gas
coupling, and demonstrate that for a specified combination of the nebular
accretion rate, $\dot{M}$, and turbulence parameter, $\alpha$, the radial
profile of the Stokes number can be calculated uniquely. Our model indicates
that the Stokes number grows sub-linearly with orbital radius, but increases
dramatically across the water-ice line. For fiducial protoplanetary disk
parameters of $\dot{M}=10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}/$year and $\alpha=10^{-3}$, our
theory yields characteristic values of the Stokes number on the order of
$\mathrm{St}\sim10^{-4}$ (corresponding to $\sim$mm-sized silicate dust) in the
inner nebula and $\mathrm{St}\sim10^{-1}$ (corresponding to $\sim$few-cm-sized
icy grains), in the outer regions of the disk. Accordingly, solids are expected
to settle into a thin sub-disk at large stellocentric distances, while
remaining vertically well-mixed inside the ice line.

with unknown items to a target user. Although the primary goal of traditional
recommendation systems is to deliver the most relevant items, such an effort
unintentionally can cause collateral effects including low diversity and
unbalanced genres or categories, benefiting particular groups of categories.
This paper proposes an approach to create recommendation lists with a
calibrated balance of genres, avoiding disproportion between the user's profile
interests and the recommendation list. The calibrated recommendations consider
concomitantly the relevance and the divergence between the genres distributions
extracted from the user's preference and the recommendation list. The main
claim is that calibration can contribute positively to generate fairer
recommendations. In particular, we propose a new trade-off equation, which
considers the users' bias to provide a recommendation list that seeks for the
users' tendencies. Moreover, we propose a conceptual framework and a decision
protocol to generate more than one thousand combinations of calibrated systems
in order to find the best combination. We compare our approach against
state-of-the-art approaches using multiple domain datasets, which are analyzed
by rank and calibration metrics. The results indicate that the trade-off, which
considers the users' bias, produces positive effects on the precision and to
the fairness, thus generating recommendation lists that respect the genre
distribution and, through the decision protocol, we also found the best system
for each dataset.

path. Both models consider the minimization of the set-up costs of the
activated hubs and inter-hub links plus the expected value of the routing costs

changes in cerebral blood volume and flow in response to neural activation.
Conventional approaches model such functional neuroimaging data as the
convolution between an impulse response, known as the hemodynamic response
function (HRF), and a binarized representation of the input (i.e., source)
signal based on the stimulus onsets, the so-called experimental paradigm (EP).
However, the EP may not be enough to characterize the whole complexity of the
underlying source signals that evoke the hemodynamic changes, such as in the
case of spontaneous resting state activity. Furthermore, the HRF varies across
brain areas and stimuli. To achieve an adaptable framework that can capture
such dynamics and unknowns of the brain function, we propose a deconvolution
method for multivariate fUS time-series that reveals both the region-specific
HRFs, and the source signals that induce the hemodynamic responses in the
studied regions. We start by modeling the fUS time-series as convolutive
mixtures and use a tensor-based approach for deconvolution based on two
assumptions: (1) HRFs are parametrizable, and (2) source signals are
uncorrelated. We test our approach on fUS data acquired during a visual
experiment on a mouse subject, focusing on three regions within the mouse
brain's colliculo-cortical, image-forming pathway: the lateral geniculate
nucleus, superior colliculus and visual cortex. The estimated HRFs in each
region are in agreement with prior works, whereas the estimated source signal
is observed to closely follow the EP. Yet, we note a few deviations from the EP
in the estimated source signal that most likely arise due to the trial-by-trial
variability of the neural response across different repetitions of the stimulus
observed in the selected regions.

We supplement this with 26 new epochs of ground-based optical spectra,
augmenting a rich spectral time series. The UV spectra do not show strong
features and are consistent with broadened versions of other SN Ic spectra
observed in the UV. We measure Fe II 5169 Angstrom velocities and show that SN

fit the data well at multiple epochs in the optical but underestimate the flux

folding, biochemical reactions or intracellular transport processes. Their
physical effects are often reflected in the first-passage times arising from
these energy landscapes. However, their calculation is notoriously challenging
and it is often difficult to identify the most relevant features of a given
energy landscape. Here we show how this can be achieved by coarse-graining the
Fokker-Planck equation to a master equation and decomposing its first-passage
times in an iterative process. We apply this method to the electrostatic
interaction between two rods of nonmuscle myosin II (NM2), which is the main
molecular motor for force generation in nonmuscle cells. Energy landscapes are
computed directly from the amino acid sequences of the three different
isoforms. Our approach allows us to identify the most relevant energy barriers
for their self-assembly into nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments and how they
change under force. In particular, we find that antiparallel configurations are
more stable than parallel ones, but also show more changes under mechanical
loading. Our work demonstrates the rich dynamics that can be expected for
NM2-assemblies under mechanical load and in general shows how one can identify
the most relevant energy barriers in complex energy landscapes.

streams. Many algorithms recently proposed in the literature tackle this
problem using a variety of data-level, algorithm-level, and ensemble
approaches. However, there is a lack of standardized and agreed-upon procedures
on how to evaluate these algorithms. This work presents a taxonomy of
algorithms for imbalanced data streams and proposes a standardized, exhaustive,
and informative experimental testbed to evaluate algorithms in a collection of
diverse and challenging imbalanced data stream scenarios. The experimental
study evaluates 24 state-of-the-art data streams algorithms on 515 imbalanced
data streams that combine static and dynamic class imbalance ratios,
instance-level difficulties, concept drift, real-world and semi-synthetic
datasets in binary and multi-class scenarios. This leads to the largest
experimental study conducted so far in the data stream mining domain. We
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art classifiers in
each of these scenarios and we provide general recommendations to end-users for
selecting the best algorithms for imbalanced data streams. Additionally, we
formulate open challenges and future directions for this domain. Our
experimental testbed is fully reproducible and easy to extend with new methods.
This way we propose the first standardized approach to conducting experiments
in imbalanced data streams that can be used by other researchers to create
trustworthy and fair evaluation of newly proposed methods. Our experimental

the received signal strength (RSS) values measured from $N$ number of Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Given the fingerprint observed by the smartphone, the
user's current location can be estimated by finding the top-k similar

the environmental factors, the dynamicity in holding the smartphone is another
source to the variation in fingerprint measurements, yet there are not many
studies addressing the fingerprint variability due to dynamic smartphone

a nonlinear location estimation using the kernel method. Specifically, our

the proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has
demonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults

processes and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0. In addition,

is accompanied by the large-scale structural reorganization of the environment
as the proton relocates, giving rise to the Grotthus mechanism. The Zundel
(H5O2+) and Eigen (H9O4+) cations are the main intermediate structures in this
process. They exhibit radically different gas-phase infrared (IR) spectra,
indicating fundamentally different environments of the solvated proton in its
first solvation shell. The question arises: is there a least common denominator
structure that explains the IR spectra of the Zundel and Eigen cations, and
hence of the solvated proton? Full dimensional quantum simulations of these
protonated cations demonstrate that two dynamical water molecules embedded in
the static environment of the parent Eigen cation constitute this fundamental
subunit. It is sufficient to explain the spectral signatures and anharmonic
couplings of the solvated proton in its first solvation shell. In particular,
we identify the anharmonic vibrational modes that explain the large broadening
of the proton transfer peak in the experimental IR spectrum of the Eigen
cation, of which the origin remained so far unclear. Our findings about the
quantum mechanical structure of the first solvation shell provide a starting
point for further investigations of the larger protonated water clusters with

most of the BH merger products, in spite of the significant recoil kicks due to

$0.01$-$10$\,Gpc$^{-3}$\,yr$^{-1}$ depending on IMBH masses. We also compute

can be well described by the Dirac equation. The mass term associated with
these collective excitations, also known as the Dirac mass, can take any value
and is directly responsible for determining whether the resultant band
structure exhibits a band gap or a Dirac point with linear dispersion.
Manipulation of this Dirac mass has inspired new methods of band structure
engineering and electron confinement. Notably, it has been shown that a
massless state necessarily localizes at any domain wall that divides regions
with Dirac masses of different signs. These localized states are known as
Jackiw-Rebbi-type (JR-type) Dirac boundary modes and their tunability and
localization features have valuable technological potential. In this study, we
experimentally demonstrate that nonlinearity within a 1D Dirac material can
result in the spontaneous appearance of a domain boundary for the Dirac mass.
Our experiments are performed in a dimerized magneto-mechanical metamaterial
that allows complete control of both the magnitude and sign of the local
material nonlinearity, as well as the sign of the Dirac mass. We find that the
massless bound state that emerges at the spontaneously appearing domain
boundary acts similarly to a dopant site within an insulator, causing the

Class-agnostic bias is defined as the distribution shifting introduced by
domain difference, which we propose Distribution Calibration Module(DCM) to
reduce. DCM owes good property of eliminating domain difference and fast
feature adaptation during optimization. Class-specific bias is defined as the
biased estimation using a few samples in novel classes, which we propose
Selected Sampling(SS) to reduce. Without inferring the actual class
distribution, SS is designed by running sampling using proposal distributions

comprising a band gap in their two-dimensional interior and one-dimensional
spin-polarized edge states in which current flows ballistically. In scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), the edge states manifest themselves as a localized
density of states. However, there is a significant research gap between the
observation of edge states in nanoscale spectroscopy, and the detection of
ballistic transport in edge channels which typically relies on transport
experiments with microscale lithographic contacts. Here, we study few-layer
films of the three-dimensional topological insulator
(Bi$_{x}$Sb$_{1-x})_2$Te$_3$, for which a topological transition to a
two-dimensional topological QSH insulator phase has been proposed. Indeed, an
edge state in the local density of states is observed within the band gap. Yet,
in nanoscale transport experiments with a four-tip STM, 2 and 3 quintuple layer
films do not exhibit a ballistic conductance in the edge channels. This
demonstrates that the detection of edge states in spectroscopy can be
misleading with regard to the identification of a QSH phase. In contrast,
nanoscale multi-tip transport experiments are a robust method for effectively
pinpointing ballistic edge channels, as opposed to trivial edge states, in
quantum materials.

force all vertices to become blue. The original throttling number of a graph
minimizes the sum of these two quantities and the product throttling number
minimizes their product. In addition, weighted throttling changes the weights
given to these two quantities when minimizing their sum. Since its
introduction, throttling has expanded to include many variants of zero forcing.
This motivates the study of zero forcing and throttling using abstract color

directly from the sample data, instead of individual fits. With this approach,
some relevant tests can be done analytically. It is based on a dimensionless
difference between the observational rotation curve and the expected one from
the baryonic matter ($\delta V^2$) as a function of the normalized radius $r_n$
(i.e., for all galaxies, $0 < r_n < 1$). Using 153 galaxies from the SPARC
galaxy sample, we find the observational distribution of $\delta V^2$.
Considering radii with $0.2 < r_n < 0.9$, most of the SPARC data are close to
the curve $\delta V^2 = r_n^{0.42}$, and about $95\%$ of the SPARC data is
between the curves $\delta V^2 = r_n^{2.2}$ and $\delta V^2 = 2 r_n^{0.38} -
r_n^{1.9} $. We consider three well known dark matter halo models (NFW, Burkert
and DC14), a simple dark matter rotation curve profile for the purpose of model
comparison (Arctan$_\alpha$) and one modified gravity model without dark matter
(MOND). By comparing the observational data distribution with the
model-inferred data, we confirm that the NFW halo lacks the necessary diversity
to reproduce several observed rotation curves, while Burkert and DC14 models
have better concordance with observational data. The lowest $\delta V^2$ curves
that can be found from NFW are linear on the normalized radius (i.e., $\delta
V^2_{NFW} = r_n$), while for Burkert $\delta V^2_{Bur} = r_n^2$ (this result is
independent of the halo density parameter, i.e., $\rho_{c}$ or $\rho_{s}$).
MOND only covers the very central region of the observed distribution, hence it
also lacks the necessary diversity, which in turn is related to larger $\chi^2$
values. In a second paper, the method will be extended to consider other
classes of modified gravity models.

astrophysical topics, from the properties of the Galactic disc to stellar
evolution models. For this purpose, we need to know their chemical composition
in detail. Unfortunately, the number of systems with chemical abundances
determined from high resolution spectroscopy remains small. Aims: Our aim is to
increase the number of open clusters with radial velocities and chemical
abundances determined from high resolution spectroscopy by sampling a few stars
in clusters not studied previously. Methods: We obtained high resolution
spectra with the FIES spectrograph at NOT for 41 stars belonging to 20 open
clusters. These stars have high astrometric membership probabilities,
determined from the Gaia second data release. Results: We derived radial
velocities for all the observed stars, which were used to confirm their
membership to the corresponding clusters. For Gulliver\,37 we cannot be sure
the observed star is a real member. We derived atmospheric parameters for the
32 stars considered real cluster members. We discarded five stars because they
have very low gravity or atmospheric parameters were not properly constrained
due to low signal-to-noise ratio spectra. Therefore, detailed chemical
abundances were determined for 28 stars belonging to 17 clusters. For most of
them, this is the first chemical analysis available in the literature. Finally,
we compared the clusters in our sample to a large population of well studied
clusters. The studied systems follow the trends, both chemical and kinematical,
described by the majority of open clusters. Worth noticing that the three most
metal-poor studied clusters (NGC\,1027, NGC\,1750 and Trumpler 2) are enhanced
in Si but not in the other alpha-elements studied (Mg, Ca and Ti).

matter (DM) models that can account for the anomaly without violating other
astrophysical/experimental constraints is the inert two Higgs doublet model, in
which the DM mass ($m_{S}$) is found to be within $\sim 54-74$ GeV. In this
model, the annihilation of DM via $SS\to b\bar{b}$ and $SS\to WW^{*}$ would
produce antiprotons and gamma rays, and may account for the excesses identified
previously in both particles. Motivated by this, we re-analyze the AMS-02
antiproton and Fermi-LAT Galactic center gamma-ray data. For the antiproton
analysis, the novel treatment is the inclusion of the charge-sign-dependent
three-dimensional solar modulation model as constrained by the time-dependent
proton data. We find that the excess of antiprotons is more distinct than
previous results based on the force-field solar modulation model. The
interpretation of this excess as the annihilation of $SS\to WW^{*}$ ($SS\to
b\bar{b}$) requires a DM mass of $\sim 40-80$ ($40-60$) GeV and a
velocity-averaged cross section of $O(10^{-26})~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$. As for the
$\gamma$-ray data analysis, besides adopting the widely-used spatial template
fitting, we employ an orthogonal approach with a data-driven spectral template
analysis. The fitting to the GeV $\gamma$-ray excess yields DM model parameters
overlapped with those to fit the antiproton excess via the $WW^{*}$ channel.
The consistency of the DM particle properties required to account for the
$W$-boson mass anomaly, the GeV antiproton excess, and the GeV $\gamma$-ray
excess suggest a common origin of them.

over Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a challenging task for both humans and
machines. The main reason is the significant variations of both normal and
arrhythmic ECG patterns among patients. Automating this process with utmost
accuracy is, therefore, highly desirable due to the advent of wearable ECG
sensors. However, even with numerous deep learning approaches proposed
recently, there is still a notable gap in the performance of global and
patient-specific ECG classification performances. This study proposes a novel
approach to narrow this gap and propose a real-time solution with shallow and
compact 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs). Methods: In
this study, we propose a novel approach for inter-patient ECG classification
using a compact 1D Self-ONN by exploiting morphological and timing information
in heart cycles. We used 1D Self-ONN layers to automatically learn
morphological representations from ECG data, enabling us to capture the shape
of the ECG waveform around the R peaks. We further inject temporal features
based on RR interval for timing characterization. The classification layers can
thus benefit from both temporal and learned features for the final arrhythmia
classification. Results: Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database, the
proposed method achieves the highest classification performance ever achieved,
i.e., 99.21% precision, 99.10% recall, and 99.15% F1-score for normal (N)

produces values in excellent agreement across a wide range of stellar
parameters, with a mean fractional difference of only 0.001 $\pm$ 0.070. We
currently incorporate six different models, and in some cases we find
significant offsets between them, reaching differences of up to 550 K and 0.6
R$_\odot$ in temperature and radius, respectively. For example, such offsets in
stellar radius would give rise to a difference in planetary radius of 60%,
negating homogeneity when combining results from different models. We also find
a trend for stars smaller than 0.4-0.5 R$_\odot$, which shows more work needs
to be done to better model these stars, even though the overall extent is
within the uncertainties of the interferometric measurements. We advocate for
the use of ARIADNE to provide improved bulk parameters of nearby A to M dwarfs
for future studies.

  Modern Coexistence Theory",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To understand the mechanisms underlying species coexistence, ecologists often
study invasion growth rates of theoretical and data-driven models. These growth
rates correspond to average per-capita growth rates of one species with respect
to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological literature,
coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive.
Intuitively, positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from
being rare. To provide a mathematically rigorous framework for this approach,
we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the signs of the
invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient,
which invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic
models and equate coexistence with permanence, i.e., a global attractor bounded
away from extinction. For models satisfying certain technical assumptions, we
introduce invasion graphs where vertices correspond to proper subsets of
species (communities) supporting an ergodic measure and directed edges
correspond to potential transitions between communities due to invasions by
missing species. These directed edges are determined by the signs of invasion
growth rates. When the invasion graph is acyclic (i.e. there is no sequence of
invasions starting and ending at the same community), we show that permanence
is determined by the signs of the invasion growth rates. In this case,
permanence is characterized by the invasibility of all -i communities, i.e.,
communities without species i where all other missing species having negative
invasion growth rates. We show that dissipative Lotka-Volterra models satisfy
our technical assumptions and computing their invasion graphs reduces to
solving systems of linear equations. We provide additional applications of the
results and discuss open problems.

  Convolutional Recurrent Networks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2111.00626",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The massive growth of network traffic data leads to a large volume of
datasets. Labeling these datasets for identifying intrusion attacks is very
laborious and error-prone. Furthermore, network traffic data have complex
time-varying non-linear relationships. The existing state-of-the-art intrusion
detection solutions use a combination of various supervised approaches along
with fused features subsets based on correlations in traffic data. These
solutions often require high computational cost, manual support in fine-tuning
intrusion detection models, and labeling of data that limit real-time
processing of network traffic. Unsupervised solutions do reduce computational
complexities and manual support for labeling data but current unsupervised
solutions do not consider spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data. To
address this, we propose a unified Autoencoder based on combining multi-scale
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (MSCNN-LSTM-AE) for
anomaly detection in network traffic. The model first employs Multiscale
Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder (MSCNN-AE) to analyze the spatial
features of the dataset, and then latent space features learned from MSCNN-AE
employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Autoencoder Network to process the
temporal features. Our model further employs two Isolation Forest algorithms as
error correction mechanisms to detect false positives and false negatives to
improve detection accuracy. %Additionally, covariance matrices forms a
Riemannian manifold that is naturally embedded with distance metrices that
facilitates descriminative patterns for detecting malicious network traffic. We
evaluated our model NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 dataset and showed our
proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional unsupervised methods
and other existing studies on the dataset.

namely, the matrix-vector and vector-matrix-vector query models. We first
consider one-sided testers, which are testers that correctly classify any PSD

logarithmic factors, in the matrix-vector query model we show a tight
$\widetilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^{p/(2p+1)})$ bound, while in the

plagued by exponential dependencies in the space complexity, which are
undesirable for processing high-dimensional data sets. In particular, once
$d\geq\log n$, there are no known non-trivial streaming algorithms for problems
such as maintaining convex hulls and L\""owner-John ellipsoids of $n$ points,
despite a long line of work in streaming computational geometry since [AHV04].
  We simultaneously improve these results to $\mathrm{poly}(d,\log n)$ bits of
space by trading off with a $\mathrm{poly}(d,\log n)$ factor distortion. We
achieve these results in a unified manner, by designing the first streaming
algorithm for maintaining a coreset for $\ell_\infty$ subspace embeddings with
$\mathrm{poly}(d,\log n)$ space and $\mathrm{poly}(d,\log n)$ distortion. Our
algorithm also gives similar guarantees in the \emph{online coreset} model.
Along the way, we sharpen results for online numerical linear algebra by
replacing a log condition number dependence with a $\log n$ dependence,
answering a question of [BDM+20]. Our techniques provide a novel connection
between leverage scores, a fundamental object in numerical linear algebra, and
computational geometry.
  For $\ell_p$ subspace embeddings, we give nearly optimal trade-offs between
space and distortion for one-pass streaming algorithms. For instance, we give a
deterministic coreset using $O(d^2\log n)$ space and $O((d\log n)^{1/2-1/p})$
distortion for $p>2$, whereas previous deterministic algorithms incurred a
$\mathrm{poly}(n)$ factor in the space or the distortion [CDW18].
  Our techniques have implications in the offline setting, where we give
optimal trade-offs between the space complexity and distortion of subspace
sketch data structures. To do this, we give an elementary proof of a ""change of

nonlinear uncertain control system. Our goal is to augment an arbitrary
controller with a safety filter such that the overall closed-loop system is
guaranteed to stay within a given state constraint set, referred to as being
safe. For systems with known dynamics, control barrier functions (CBFs) provide
a scalar condition for determining if a system is safe. For uncertain systems,
robust or adaptive CBF certification approaches have been proposed. However,
these approaches can be conservative or require the system to have a particular
parametric structure. For more generic uncertain systems, machine learning
approaches have been used to approximate the CBF condition. These works
typically assume that the learning module is sufficiently trained prior to
deployment. Safety during learning is not guaranteed. We propose a barrier
Bayesian linear regression (BBLR) approach that guarantees safe online learning
of the CBF condition for the true, uncertain system. We assume that the error
between the nominal system and the true system is bounded and exploit the
structure of the CBF condition. We show that our approach can safely expand the
set of certifiable control inputs despite system and learning uncertainties.
The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in simulation using a

high extinction ratio of 30.2 dB, and a high slope rate (SR) of 747.64 dB/nm.
The combination of low IL and high SR promises this device for Fano resonance
applications. Our device also can achieve wavelength de-interleaving function

optical interleavers that require a symmetric flat-top filter shape. Optical

theory (DFT) is hampered by delocalization errors, especially for correlated

have been developed to reduce delocalization error: eliminating the global
curvature with respect to charge addition or removal, and computing a linear
response Hubbard U as a measure of local curvature at the metal center at fixed
charge and applying it to the transition-metal complex in a DFT+U framework. We
investigate the relationship between the two measures of delocalization error
as we manipulate the ligand field strength by varying the number of
strong-field ligands in a series of heteroleptic complexes or by geometrically
constraining the metal-ligand bond length in homoleptic octahedral complexes.
We show that across these sets of complexes with varying ligand fields, an
inverse relationship generally exists between global and local curvatures. We
find that effects of ligand substitution on both measures of delocalization are
typically additive, but the two quantities seldom coincide. The observation of
ligand additivity suggests opportunities for evaluating errors on homoleptic

rethink the role of adaption in the feature extractor of CNAPs, which is a
state-of-the-art representative few-shot method. To investigate the role,
Almost Zero-Shot (AZS) task is designed by fixing the support set to replace
the common scheme, which provides corresponding support sets for the different
conditional prior of different tasks. The AZS experiment results infer that the
adaptation works little in the feature extractor. However, CNAPs cannot be
robust to randomly selected support sets and perform poorly on some datasets of
Meta-Dataset because of its scattered mean embeddings responded by the simple
mean operator. To enhance the robustness of CNAPs, Canonical Mean Filter (CMF)
module is proposed to make the mean embeddings intensive and stable in feature
space by mapping the support sets into a canonical form. CMFs make CNAPs robust
to any fixed support sets even if they are random matrices. This attribution
makes CNAPs be able to remove the mean encoder and the parameter adaptation
network at the test stage, while CNAP-CMF on AZS tasks keeps the performance
with one-shot tasks. It leads to a big parameter reduction. Precisely, 40.48\%
parameters are dropped at the test stage. Also, CNAP-CMF outperforms CNAPs in
one-shot tasks because it addresses inner-task unstable performance problems.

Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). We measure the weak
lensing signal of a sample of 8882 AGNs constructed using HSC and WISE
photometry. The lensing detection around AGNs has a signal-to-noise ratio of
15. As expected, we find that the lensing mass profile is consistent with that
of massive galaxies ($M_{*}\sim 10.8~M_\odot$). Surprisingly, the lensing
signal remains unchanged when the AGN sample is split into low and high stellar
mass hosts. Specifically, we find that the excess surface density (ESD) of
AGNs, residing in galaxies with high stellar masses, significantly differs from
that of the control sample. We further fit a halo occupation distribution model
to the data to infer the posterior distribution of parameters including the
average halo mass. We find that the characteristic halo mass of the full AGN
population lies near the knee ($\rm log(M_h/h^{-1}M_{\odot})=12.0$) of the
stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). Illustrative of the results given above,
the halo masses of AGNs residing in host galaxies with high stellar masses
(i.e., above the knee of the SHMR) falls below the calibrated SHMR while the
halo mass of the low stellar mass sample is more consistent with the

evolutionary products of close-orbit binary star systems. They are often
observed as millisecond pulsars and may continue evolving into ultra-compact
X-ray binaries (UCXBs) and continuous gravitational wave (GW) sources that will
be detected by space-borne GW observatories, such as LISA, TianQin and Taiji.
Nevertheless, the stability of NS+He WD binaries undergoing mass transfer is
not well studied and still under debate. In this paper, we model the evolution
of NS+He WD binaries with WD masses ranging from 0.17-0.45 $M_{\odot}$,
applying the detailed stellar evolution code mesa. Contrary to previous studies
based on hydrodynamics, we find that apparently all NS+He WD binaries undergo
stable mass transfer. We find for such UCXBs that the larger the WD mass, the
larger the maximum mass-transfer rate and the smaller the minimum orbital
period during their evolution. Finally, we demonstrate numerically and
analytically that there is a tight correlation between WD mass and GW frequency
for UCXBs, independent of NS mass.

state-of-the-art methods by more than 35% and gave an improvement of no more

node selection is continuously emphasized after reaching a minimal depth in the

easily incorporated into integer programming solvers and has the potential to
significantly increase the diversity of solution sets.

exponent of matrix multiplication. Previous work within this approach ruled out
certain families of groups as a route to obtaining $\omega = 2$, while other
families of groups remain potentially viable. In this paper we turn our
attention to matrix groups, whose usefulness within this framework was
relatively unexplored.
  We first show that groups of Lie type cannot prove $\omega=2$ within the
group-theoretic approach. This is based on a representation-theoretic argument
that identifies the second-smallest dimension of an irreducible representation
of a group as a key parameter that determines its viability in this framework.
Our proof builds on Gowers' result concerning product-free sets in quasirandom
groups. We then give another barrier that rules out certain natural matrix
group constructions that make use of subgroups that are far from being
self-normalizing.
  Our barrier results leave open several natural paths to obtain $\omega = 2$
via matrix groups. To explore these routes we propose working in the continuous
setting of Lie groups, in which we develop an analogous theory. Obtaining the
analogue of $\omega=2$ in this potentially easier setting is a key challenge
that represents an intermediate goal short of actually proving $\omega = 2$. We
give two constructions in the continuous setting, each of which evades one of
our two barriers.

for Collaborative Filtering (CF) based Recommender Systems (RS). It is a common
practice to learn informative user and item representations by performing
embedding propagation on a user-item bipartite graph, and then provide the
users with personalized item suggestions based on the representations. Despite
effectiveness, existing algorithms neglect precious interactive features
between user-item pairs in the embedding process. When predicting a user's
preference for different items, they still aggregate the user tree in the same
way, without emphasizing target-related information in the user neighborhood.
Such a uniform aggregation scheme easily leads to suboptimal user and item
representations, limiting the model expressiveness to some extent.
  In this work, we address this problem by building bilateral interactive
guidance between each user-item pair and proposing a new model named IA-GCN
(short for InterActive GCN). Specifically, when learning the user
representation from its neighborhood, we assign higher attention weights to
those neighbors similar to the target item. Correspondingly, when learning the
item representation, we pay more attention to those neighbors resembling the
target user. This leads to interactive and interpretable features, effectively
distilling target-specific information through each graph convolutional
operation. Our model is built on top of LightGCN, a state-of-the-art GCN model
for CF, and can be combined with various GCN-based CF architectures in an
end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IA-GCN.

However, most of these methods failed to effectively leverage the predicted
discriminative information, and thus cause mode collapse for generator. In this
work, we address this problem from a different perspective and design a simple
yet effective adversarial paradigm in the form of a discriminator-free
adversarial learning network (DALN), wherein the category classifier is reused
as a discriminator, which achieves explicit domain alignment and category
distinguishment through a unified objective, enabling the DALN to leverage the
predicted discriminative information for sufficient feature alignment.
Basically, we introduce a Nuclear-norm Wasserstein discrepancy (NWD) that has
definite guidance meaning for performing discrimination. Such NWD can be
coupled with the classifier to serve as a discriminator satisfying the
K-Lipschitz constraint without the requirements of additional weight clipping
or gradient penalty strategy. Without bells and whistles, DALN compares
favorably against the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on a variety of
public datasets. Moreover, as a plug-and-play technique, NWD can be directly
used as a generic regularizer to benefit existing UDA algorithms. Code is

provides, in particular, appropriate modelling of responses that are restricted
in some way, for example, if responses are positive or are restricted to an
interval. Restrictions of this sort are easily incorporated in the modeling
framework. Restriction to an interval is typically ignored in common models
yielding inappropriate models, for example, when modeling Likert-type data. The
model also extends common response time models, which can be treated as special

guarantees the privacy and data integrity and authenticity of local model

location-sensing. It is developed using Xtext and Xtend as an Eclipse plug-in,
and currently, it supports native Android apps. eGEN is evaluated through
controlled experiments by instrumenting the generated code in five
location-based open-source Android applications. The experimental results show
4.35 minutes of average GPS reduction per hour and 188 mA of average reduction
in battery consumption while showing only 97 meters degrade in location
accuracy over 3 kilometers of a cycling path. Hence, we believe that code
generated by eGEN would help developers to balance between energy and accuracy
requirements of location-based applications. The source code, documentation,

exponential filters. Such a coarse-graining prescription gives rise to
inflaton-Langevin equations sourced by colored noise that is correlated in
$e$-fold time. The dynamics are studied first in slow-roll for simple
potentials using first-order perturbative, semi-analytical calculations which
are later compared to numerical simulations. Subsequent calculations are
performed using an exponentially correlated noise which appears as a leading
order correction to the full slow-roll noise correlation functions of the type
$\big\langle \xi(N)\xi(N') \big\rangle_{(n)}\sim\left( \cosh\left[ n(N-N')+1
\right] \right)^{-1}$. We find that the power spectrum of curvature
perturbations $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}$ is suppressed at early $e$-folds, with the
suppression controlled by $n$. Furthermore, we use the leading order,
exponentially correlated noise and perform a first passage time analysis to
compute the statistics of the stochastic $e$-fold distribution $\mathcal{N}$
and derive an approximate expression for the mean number of $e$-folds
$\big\langle \mathcal{N} \big\rangle$. Comparing analytical results with
numerical simulations of the inflaton dynamics, we show that the leading order

exact noise, the latter being more difficult to simulate.

due to the lack of accurate annotation on the temporal sequence of sign

for CSLR. However, when extracting temporal features in these works, most of
the methods using a fixed temporal receptive field and cannot extract the
temporal features well for each sign language word. In order to obtain more
accurate temporal features, this paper proposes a multi-scale temporal network
(MSTNet). The network mainly consists of three parts. The Resnet and two fully
connected (FC) layers constitute the frame-wise feature extraction part. The
time-wise feature extraction part performs temporal feature learning by first
extracting temporal receptive field features of different scales using the
proposed multi-scale temporal block (MST-block) to improve the temporal
modeling capability, and then further encoding the temporal features of
different scales by the transformers module to obtain more accurate temporal
features. Finally, the proposed multi-level Connectionist Temporal

results. The multi-level CTC loss enables better learning and updating of the
shallow network parameters in CNN, and the method has no parameter increase and
can be flexibly embedded in other models. Experimental results on two publicly

Parallel-Depth Grasp Generation (PDG-Generation) method is proposed to generate

  Personalization in Federated Learning","Accepted by CVPR2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model. Despite the
recent progress, it remains challenging to deal with heterogeneous data
clients, as the discrepant data distributions usually prevent the global model
from delivering good generalization ability on each participating client. In
this paper, we propose CD^2-pFed, a novel Cyclic Distillation-guided Channel
Decoupling framework, to personalize the global model in FL, under various
settings of data heterogeneity. Different from previous works which establish
layer-wise personalization to overcome the non-IID data across different
clients, we make the first attempt at channel-wise assignment for model
personalization, referred to as channel decoupling. To further facilitate the
collaboration between private and shared weights, we propose a novel cyclic
distillation scheme to impose a consistent regularization between the local and
global model representations during the federation. Guided by the cyclical
distillation, our channel decoupling framework can deliver more accurate and
generalized results for different kinds of heterogeneity, such as feature skew,
label distribution skew, and concept shift. Comprehensive experiments on four
benchmarks, including natural image and medical image analysis tasks,
demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of our method on both local and
external validations.

similar physical rules. However, collective mobility patterns, including
average range and diversity of visitation, and commuting directions, all
exhibit different behaviors and spatial patterns across income categories.
Hotspot locations that attract more cycling activities are quite different over

both cities, and of a smaller mobility diversity in Beijing but a larger

a neural network that extracts the target SEs by conditioning it on clues

Systems based on SE class labels can directly optimize embedding vectors

extending these systems to extract new SE classes not encountered during
training is not easy. Enrollment-based approaches extract SEs by finding sounds
in the mixtures that share similar characteristics to the enrollment audio
samples. These approaches do not explicitly rely on SE class definitions and
can thus handle new SE classes. In this paper, we introduce a TSE framework,
SoundBeam, that combines the advantages of both approaches. We also perform an

orbiting in the ergoregion or close to the outer ergosurface of the Kerr black
hole (""dragged"" configurations). The corotating tori under consideration are
perfect fluid configurations with barotropic equation of state, orbiting on the
equatorial plane of the central Kerr black hole. The possibility of magnetized
tori with a toroidal magnetic field is also discussed. Indications on the
attractors where dragged tori can be observed are provided with the analysis of
the fluid characteristics and geometrical features, relevant for the tori
stability and their observations. QPOs emissions from the inner edges of the
dragged tori are also discussed. We argue that the smaller dragged tori could
be subjected to a characteristic instability, effect of the frame-dragging.
This possibility is thoroughly explored. This can finally lead to the
destruction of the torus (disk exfoliation) which can combine with accretion
and processes present in the regions very close to the black hole horizon. Tori
are characterized according to the central attractor dimensionless spin. These
structures can be observed orbiting black holes with dimensionless spin a >

extends classical first-order logic by modulo-counting, threshold-counting and
exact-counting quantifiers, all applied to tuples of variables (here, residues
are given as terms while moduli and thresholds are given explicitly). Our main
result shows that satisfaction for this logic is decidable in two-fold
exponential space. If only threshold- and exact-counting quantifiers are
allowed, we prove an upper bound of alternating two-fold exponential time with
linearly many alternations. This latter result almost matches Berman's exact
complexity of first-order logic without counting quantifiers.
  To obtain these results, we first translate threshold- and exact-counting
quantifiers into classical first-order logic in polynomial time (which already
proves the second result). To handle the remaining modulo-counting quantifiers
for tuples, we first reduce them in doubly exponential time to modulo-counting
quantifiers for single elements. For these quantifiers, we provide a quantifier
elimination procedure similar to Reddy and Loveland's procedure for first-order
logic and analyse the growth of coefficients, constants, and moduli appearing
in this process. The bounds obtained this way allow to restrict quantification
in the original formula to integers of bounded size which then implies the
first result mentioned above.
  Our logic is incomparable with the logic considered by Chistikov et al. in
2022. They allow more general counting operations in quantifiers, but only
unary quantifiers. The move from unary to non-unary quantifiers is non-trivial,
since, e.g., the non-unary version of the H\""artig quantifier results in an
undecidable theory.

training data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations

illustrate that end-to-end learning strategies yield parametrizations that

aggregates using a scattering matrix technique that allows us to deal with
arbitrarily large systems. The presented theory performs well for both strong
and weak mixing of exciton and CT states, bridging the gap between previously
employed methods which are applicable in only one of these limits. In
experimental spectra the homogeneous linewidth is often too large to resolve
all optically allowed transitions individually, resulting in a characteristic
two-peak absorption spectrum in both the weak- and strong-coupling regime.
Using the scattering matrix technique we examine the contributions of free and

feedback systems compared to traditional controllers, due to their ability to
act as general function approximators. However, quantifying their safety and
robustness properties has proven challenging due to the non-linearities of the
activation functions inside the neural network. A key robustness indicator is
certifying the stability properties of the feedback system and providing a
region of attraction, which has been addressed in previous literature. However,
these works only address linear systems or require one to abstract the plant
non-linearities and bound them using slope and sector constraints. In this
paper we use a Sum of Squares programming framework to compute the stability of
non-linear systems with neural network controllers directly. Within this
framework, we can propose higher order candidate Lyapunov functions with richer
structures that are able to better capture the dynamics of the non-linear
system and the nonlinearities in the neural network. We are also able to
analyse these systems in continuous time, whereas other methods rely on
discretising the system. These higher order Lyapunov functions are used in
conjunction with higher order multipliers on the inequality and equality
constraints that bound the neural network input-output properties. The volume
of the region of attraction computed is increased compared to other methods,
allowing for better safety guarantees on the stability of the system. We are
also able to easily analyse non-linear polynomial systems, which is not
possible to do with other methods. We are also able to conduct robustness
analysis on the parameter uncertainty. We show the benefits of our method using

no problem with the cosmological constant, which is a physical constant, namely

of the TDEs ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-15oi, successfully reproducing our earlier
constraints on black hole mass $M_\bullet$ and spin $a_\bullet$ from full
on-the-fly ray-tracing. We use the library to fit mock observational data to
explore the degeneracies among parameters, finding that 1) hotter thermal disk
and edge-on inclination angle spectra offer tighter constraints on $M_\bullet$
and $a_\bullet$; 2) the constraining power of spectra on $M_\bullet$ and
$a_\bullet$ increases as a power-law with the number of X-ray counts, and the
index of the power law is higher for hotter thermal disk spectra; 3)
multi-epoch X-ray spectra partially break the degeneracy between $M_\bullet$
and $a_\bullet$; 4) the time-dependent level of X-ray absorption can be
constrained from spectral fitting. The tabulated model and slim disk model are

leading to many photonic device applications. The light-matter interactions are
commonly probed by optical spectroscopy, which, however, have some limitations
such as diffraction-limited spatial resolution, tiny momentum transfer and
non-continuous excitation/detection. In this work, using scanning transmission
electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) with
ultra-wide energy and momentum match and sub-nanometer spatial resolution, we
study the optical microcavity resonant spectroscopy in a single SiC nanowire.
The longitudinal Fabry-Perot (FP) resonating modes and the transverse
whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) are simultaneously excited and detected, which
span from near-infrared (~ 1.2 {\mu}m) to ultraviolet (~ 0.2 {\mu}m) spectral
regime and the momentum transfer can be ranging up to 108 cm{^{-1}}. The size
effects on the resonant spectra of nanowires are also revealed. Moreover, the
nanoscale decay length of resonant EELS is revealed, which is contributed by
the strongly localized electron-photon interactions in the SiC nanowire. This
work provides a new alternative technique to investigate the optical resonating
spectroscopy of a single nanowire structure and to explore the light-matter
interactions in dielectric nanostructures, which is also promising for
modulating free electrons via photonic structures.

cues was investigated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation based on a kinetic
transport equation, which considers an internal adaptation dynamics as well as
a finite tumbling duration. It was found that there exist two different regimes
of the adaptation time, between which the effect of the adaptation time on the
aggregation behavior is reversed; that is, when the adaptation time is as small
as the running duration, the aggregation becomes increasingly steeper as the
adaptation time increases, while, when the adaptation time is as large as the
diffusion time of the population density, the aggregation becomes more
diffusive as the adaptation time increases. Moreover, the aggregation profile
becomes bimodal (volcano) at the large adaptation-time regime when the tumbling
duration is sufficiently large while it is always unimodal at the small
adaptation-time regime. A remarkable result of this study is the identification
of the parameter regime and scaling for the volcano effect. That is, by
comparing the results of MC simulations to the continuum-limit models obtained
at each of the small and large adaptation-time scalings, it is clarified that
the volcano effect arises due to the coupling of diffusion, adaptation, and
finite tumbling duration, which occurs at the large adaptation-time scaling.

important unsolved problem in strongly correlated electron systems. A unified

this article, we explain the $B_{1g}$ symmetry nematic transition in
FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, the $B_{2g}$ symmetry nematicity in AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A=Cs,
Rb), and the smectic state in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ based on the same framework. We
investigate the quantum interference mechanism between spin fluctuations by
developing the density wave equation. The observed rich variety of
nematic/smectic orders is naturally understood in this mechanism. The
nematic/smectic orders depend on the characteristic shape and topology of the
Fermi surface (FS) of each compound. (i) In FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, each FS is very
small and the dxy-orbital hole pocket is below the Fermi level. In this case,
the small spin fluctuations on three dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals cooperatively
lead to the $B_{1g}$ nematic order. The experimental Lifshitz transition below
the nematic transition temperature $(T_S)$ is naturally reproduced. (ii) In
BaFe$_2$As$_2$, the dxy-orbital hole pocket emerges around M point, and each FS
is relatively large. The strong spin fluctuations due to the dxy-orbital
nesting give rise to the $B_{1g}$ nematic order and the smectic order, and the
latter transition temperature ($T^*$) exceeds the former one $T_S$. (iii) In
heavily hole-doped AFe$_2$As$_2$, the large dxy-orbital hole pocket and the
four tiny Dirac pockets appear due to the hole-doping. The $B_{2g}$ nematic
bond order emerges on the dxy-orbital hole pocket due to the same interference
mechanism. The present paramagnon interference mechanism provides a unified
explanation of why the variety of nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based
superconductors is so rich, based on the well-established fermiology of
Fe-based superconductors.

enhance the model robustness. Empirical results on 10 real-world configurable

different degrees of freedom of a molecule is studied based on the
multi-temperature model of rational extended thermodynamics. Since the system
of field equations is hyperbolic, the shock-structure solution is not always
regular, and discontinuous parts (sub-shocks) can be formed. For given values
of the mass ratio and the specific heats of the constituents, we identify the
possible sub-shocks as the Mach number $M_0$ of the shock wave and the
concentration $c$ of the constituents change. In the plane $(c,M_0)$, we
identify the possible regions for the sub-shock formation. The analysis is
obtained to verify when the velocity of the shock wave meets a characteristic
velocity in the unperturbed or perturbed equilibrium states that gives a
necessary condition for the sub-shock formation. The condition becomes
necessary and sufficient when the velocity of the shock becomes greater than
the maximum characteristic velocity in the unperturbed state. Namely, the
regions with no sub-shocks, a sub-shock for only one constituent, or sub-shocks
for both constituents are comprehensively classified. The most interesting case
is that the lighter molecule has more degrees of freedom than that of the heavy
one. In this situation, the topology of the various regions becomes different.
We also solve the system of the field equations numerically using the
parameters in the various regions and confirm whether the sub-shocks emerge or
not. Finally, the relationship between an acceleration wave in a constituent
and the sub-shock in the other constituent is explicitly derived.

increasingly more concerned about robust accuracy under distributional shifts.
While a variety of methods have been proposed to robustify neural networks,
these techniques often target models trained on ImageNet classification. At the
same time, it is a common practice to use ImageNet pretrained backbones for
downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
classification from different domains. This raises a question: Can these robust
image classifiers transfer robustness to downstream tasks? For object detection
and semantic segmentation, we find that a vanilla Swin Transformer, a variant
of Vision Transformer tailored for dense prediction tasks, transfers robustness
better than Convolutional Neural Networks that are trained to be robust to the
corrupted version of ImageNet. For CIFAR10 classification, we find that models
that are robustified for ImageNet do not retain robustness when fully
fine-tuned. These findings suggest that current robustification techniques tend
to emphasize ImageNet evaluations. Moreover, network architecture is a strong
source of robustness when we consider transfer learning.

popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, focusing on the most
popular metrics that only consider the overlap between the generated captions
and human annotation could result in using common words and phrases, which
lacks distinctiveness, i.e., many similar images have the same caption. In this
paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions via comparing
and reweighting with a set of similar images. First, we propose a
distinctiveness metric -- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the
distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our
metric reveals that the human annotations of each image in the MSCOCO dataset
are not equivalent based on distinctiveness; however, previous works normally
treat the human annotations equally during training, which could be a reason
for generating less distinctive captions. In contrast, we reweight each
ground-truth caption according to its distinctiveness during training. We
further integrate a long-tailed weight strategy to highlight the rare words
that contain more information, and captions from the similar image set are
sampled as negative examples to encourage the generated sentence to be unique.
Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed
approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw
and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide
variety of image captioning baselines. These results are further confirmed
through a user study.

quadrature rules; in the singular case it is combined with a B-spline recursion
over the spline degree and with a singularity extraction technique, extended to
the multi-patch setting for the first time. A threshold selection strategy is
proposed to automatically distinguish between nearly singular and regular
integrals. Numerical examples on relevant benchmarks show that the expected
convergence orders are achieved with uniform discretization and a small number
of uniformly spaced quadrature nodes.

physics 8 experiments and in countless applications in science and technology.
They had a spectacular progress in performance over almost 40 years since their
first introduction, but their evolution is now slowing down. The position
resolution for single particle hits is larger than a few microns in the most
advanced sensors. This value was reached already over 30 years ago [1]. The
minimum ionising path length a sensor can detect is several tens of microns.
There are fundamental reasons why these limits will not be substantially
improved by further refinements of the current technology. This makes silicon
sensors unsuitable to applications where the physics signature is the short
path of a recoiling atom and constrains the layout of physics experiments where
they represent by far the best option like high energy physics collider
experiments. In perspective, the availability of sensors with sub-micron
spatial resolution, in the order of a few tens of nanometres, would be a
disruptive change for the sensor technology with a foreseeable huge impact on
experiment layout and various applications of these devices. For providing such
a leap in resolution, we propose a novel design based on a purely digital
circuit. This disruptive concept potentially enables pixel sizes much smaller
than 1{\mu}m2 and a number of advantages in terms of power consumption, readout
speed and reduced thickness (for low mass sensors).

a carefully tuned variance reduction method so as to evaluate the various terms

deterministic methods that have mainly focused on such sample generation
strategies for contrastive learning. We further propose a stochastic
contrastive loss to learn proper video distributions and handle the inherent

phenomenon. Rent-seeking and excessive reliance on mineral revenues can be
attributed largely to social psychology. Mineral booms (whether due to the
discovery of mineral reserves or to the drastic rise in commodity prices) start
as positive income shocks that can subsequently evolve into influential and
expectation-changing public and media narratives; these lead consecutively to
unrealistic demands that favor immediate consumption of accrued mineral
revenues and to the postponement of productive investment. To our knowledge,
this paper is the first empirical analysis that tests hypotheses regarding the
psychological underpinnings of resource mismanagement in mineral-rich states.
Our study relies on an extensive personal survey (of 1977 respondents) carried
out in Almaty, Kazakhstan, between May and August 2018. We find empirical
support for a positive link between exposure to news and inflated expectations
regarding mineral availability, as well as evidence that the latter can
generate preferences for excessive consumption, and hence, rent-seeking.

the high and very high redshift Universe. Evidence points to the existence of
high dust masses in massive star forming galaxies already during the Epoch of
Reionization, potentially affecting the escape of ionising photons into the
intergalactic medium. Moreover, correctly estimating dust extinction at UV
wavelengths is essential for precise ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF)
prediction and interpretation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of dust
on the observed properties of high redshift galaxies, and cosmic reionization.
To this end, we couple a physical model for dust production to the fully
coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation code RAMSES-CUDATON,
and perform a $16^3$, $2048^3$, simulation, that we call DUSTiER for DUST in
the Epoch of Reionization. It yields galaxies with dust masses and UV slopes
compatible with constraints at z $\geq 5$. We find that extinction has a
dramatic impact on the bright end of the UVLF, even as early as $\rm z=8$, and
our dusty UVLFs are in better agreement with observations than dust-less UVLFs.
The fraction of obscured star formation rises up to 45% at $\rm z=5$, in
agreement with some of the latest results from ALMA. Finally, we find that dust
reduces the escape of ionising photons from galaxies more massive than $10^{10}
M_\odot$ (brighter than $\approx -18$ MAB1600) by >10%, and possibly up to
80-90% for our most massive galaxies. Nevertheless, we find that the ionising
escape fraction is first and foremost set by neutral Hydrogen in galaxies, as
the latter produces transmissions up to 100 times smaller than through dust
alone.

electrodynamics, the issue of how to observe the so-called Abraham term ${\bf
f}^{\rm Aterm} = [(\varepsilon\mu-1)/c^2] \partial/\partial t ({\bf E}\times
{\bf H})$ has been a main point. Recent years have seen a number of beautiful
experiments in radiation optics, but these experiments usually give no
information about the Abraham term as this term simply fluctuates out. So one
is left with somewhat indirect verifications of this force, as in the radiation
pressure of Jones {et al.} in the 1950's, testing the radiation pressure on a
mirror immersed in a dielectric liquid. Now, there is a different way to test
the existence of ${\bf f}^{ \rm Aterm}$, namely to work with low
(quasi-stationary) frequencies enabling one to observe the sinusoidal variation
of the force directly. These kind of experiments were actually done by Walker
{\it et al.} in 1he 1970's, using BaTiO$_3$ as a high-frequency dielectric
(permittivity $\varepsilon \sim 3600$). Now, in recent years there have
appeared dielectric materials with giant permittivities, of order $10^5$ or
even higher. It is therefore natural to consider the idea of Walker {\it et
al.} anew, in order to test if this demanding experiment can be facilitated and
give better accuracy. That is the main topic of the present paper. The positive
outcome of these kinds of experiments clearly supports the Abraham
energy-momentum tensor at low frequencies. The Minkowski tensor is unable to
predict a torque at all. The low-frequency and the high-frequency regimes are
in this way highly contrasted, as it is obvious that in optical experiments the
Minkowski tensor is by far the simplest and most convenient one to use. We end
this note by commenting upon the use of the Einstein-Laub tensor (1908) in
explaining this experiment, and discuss also the influence from air friction.

propose a two-stage Point Transformer-in-Transformer (Point-TnT) approach which
combines local and global attention mechanisms, enabling both individual points
and patches of points to attend to each other effectively. Experiments on shape
classification show that such an approach provides more useful features for
downstream tasks than the baseline Transformer, while also being more

large-scale data collection, data labelling, network training, and fine-tuning
of models. Sharing and reuse of these elaborated models between intelligent
systems deployed in a different environment, which is known as transfer

accelerates the uptake of intelligent systems in environments such as smart
building and smart city applications. In this context, the communication and
knowledge exchange between AI-enabled environments depend on a complicated
networks of systems, system of systems, digital assets, and their chain of
dependencies that hardly follows the centralized schema of traditional
information systems. Rather, it requires an adaptive decentralized system
architecture that is empowered by features such as data provenance, workflow

propose a decentralized and adaptive software framework based on blockchain and

an obstructed atomic limit (OAL). In the case of $C_3$ symmetry, the second
order topology can be calculated from bulk symmetry indicator invariants, which
predict the value of fractional corner charges in symmetry conserving
nanoflakes. The procedure is exemplified by MoS$_2$ in the H-phase, which
constitutes a generic example of a 2D OAL material and the predicted fractional
corner charges is verified by direct calculations of nanoflakes with armchair
edges. We also determine the bulk topological polarization, which always lead
to gapless states at zigzag edges and thus deteriorates the concept of
fractional corner charges in nanoflakes with zigzag edges that are typically
more stable that armchair flakes. We then consider the case of TiCl$_2$, which
has vanishing polarization as well as an OAL and we verify that the edge states
of nanoflakes with zigzag edges may indeed by passivated such that the edges
remain insulating and the corner charges are well defined. For the 28 OAL
materials we find that 16 have vanishing polarization and these materials thus
constitute a promising starting point for experimental verification of second

back-ends to a simpler cosine similarity measure for speaker verification.
Popular parametric back-ends include the probabilistic linear discriminant
analysis (PLDA) and its variants. This paper investigates the properties of
margin-based cross-entropy losses leading to such a shift and aims to find
scoring back-ends best suited for speaker verification. In addition, we revisit
the pre-processing techniques which have been widely used in the past and

emerged as teams experimented with different tools and approaches: developers
chose tasks according to location, tasks with vague requirements are performed
collocated while individual tasks requiring focus are best performed at home;
large meetings are virtual, preserving co-located time for collaborative tasks;
using virtual rooms to maintain unscheduled meetings as they communicate mental
presence to teammates, lowering the threshold for intra-team unscheduled talks.
The strategies can help organizations create a productive and effective
environment for developers.

a small percentage of Earth's mass was delivered after the last giant impact in
a stage of 'late accretion.' There is ongoing debate about the nature of
late-accreted material and the sizes of late-accreted bodies. Earth appears
isotopically most similar to enstatite chondrites and achondrites. It has been
suggested that late accretion must have been dominated by enstatite-like bodies
that originated in the inner disk, rather than ordinary or carbonaceous
chondrites. Here, we examine the provenances of 'leftover' planetesimals
present in the inner disk in the late stages of accretion simulations.
Dynamically excited planet formation produces planets and embryos with similar
provenances, suggesting that the Moon-forming impactor may have had a stable
isotope composition very similar to the proto-Earth. Commonly, some
planetesimal-sized bodies with similar provenances to the Earth-like planets
are left at the end of the main stage of growth. The most chemically-similar
planetesimals are typically fragments of proto-planets ejected millions of
years earlier. If these similar-provenance bodies are later accreted by the
planet, they will represent late-accreted mass that naturally matches Earth's
composition. The planetesimal-sized bodies that exist during the giant impact
phase can have large core mass fractions, with core provenances similar to the
proto-Earth. These bodies are an important potential source for highly
siderophile elements. The range of core fractions in leftover planetesimals
complicates simple inferences as to the mass and origin of late accretion based
on the highly siderophile elements in the mantle.

employs plasmonic nanostructures array with judiciously designed symmetry,

hydrogen-induced changes in the phonon spectrum of the host MXene, (ii)
emerging hydrogen-based phonon modes, and (iii) charge transfer from hydrogen

the open boundary problem with complex eigenfrequencies. We first highlight
some fundamental problems with currently adopted formulas using QNM
perturbation theory, when perturbations are added outside the resonator
structure and present a first potential step for solving this problem connected
to a regularization of the QNMs. We then show an example for a full
three-dimensional plasmonic resonator of arbitrary shape and complex dispersion
and loss, clearly displaying the divergent nature of the first-order mode
change predicted from QNM perturbation theory. Subsequently, we concentrate on
the illustrative case of a one-dimensional dielectric barrier, where analytical
QNM solutions are possible. We inspect the change of the mode frequency as
function of distance between the cavity and another smaller barrier structure.
The results obtained from a few QNM expansion are compared with exact
analytical solutions from a transfer matrix approach. We show explicitly how
regularization prevents a problematic spatial divergence for QNM perturbations
in the far field, though eventually higher-order effects and multimodes can
also play a role in the full scattering solution, and retaining a pure discrete
QNM picture becomes questionable in such situations, since the input-output
coupling ultimately involves reservoir modes.

distribution of Halpha excess galaxies is peaked at 3 \times 10^10 Msun and
almost all fall well within the star-forming locus in the [OIII]/Hbeta versus
[NII]/Halpha BPT disgram. Halpha excess galaxies are twice as likely to exhibit
Halpha line asymmetries and 1.55 times more likely to be detected at 1 GHz in
the VLA FIRST survey compared to control sample galaxies. The radio luminosity
per unit stellar mass decreases with the stellar age of the system. Using
stacked spectra, we demonstrate that [NeV] emission is not present in the very
youngest of the radio-quiet Halpha excess galaxies with detectable Wolf-Rayet
features, suggesting that black hole growth has not yet commenced in such

human history and helps tell the worlds story. As a result of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, the Internet has become an increasingly important source
of fashion information. However, with a growing number of web pages and social
data, it is nearly impossible for humans to manually catch up with the ongoing
evolution and the continuously variable content in this domain. The proper
management and exploitation of big data can pave the way for the substantial
growth of the global economy as well as citizen satisfaction. Therefore,
computer scientists have found it challenging to handle e-commerce fashion
websites by using big data and machine learning technologies. This paper first
proposes a scalable focused Web Crawler engine based on the distributed
computing platforms to extract and process fashion data on e-commerce websites.
The role of the proposed platform is then described in developing a
disentangled feature extraction method by employing deep convolutional
generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for content-based image indexing and
retrieval. Finally, the state-of-the-art solutions are compared, and the
results of the proposed approach are analyzed on a standard dataset. For the
real-life implementation of the proposed solution, a Web-based application is
developed on Apache Storm, Kafka, Solr, and Milvus platforms to create a
fashion search engine called SnapMode.

configurations, and hence are not considered useful for encoding memory.
Multistable and history-dependent responses usually emerge from quenched
disorder, for example in amorphous solids or crumpled sheets. In contrast, due
to geometric frustration, periodic magnetic systems can espouse an extensive
manifold of quasi-degenerate configurations. Inspired by the topological
structure of frustrated artificial spin ices, we introduce an approach to
design ordered, periodic mechanical metamaterials that exhibit an extensive set
of spatially disordered states. Our mechanical systems encompass continuous
degrees of freedom, and are hence richer than their magnetic counterparts. We
show how such systems exhibit history-dependent and non-Abelain responses, as
their state may depend on the order in which external manipulations were
applied. Thus, multistability and potential to store complex memory emerge from
geometric frustration in ordered mechanical lattices that create their own
disorder.

of singing voice are not annotated with voice level we propose a means to
estimate the voice level from the signal's timbre using a neural voice level
estimator. We introduce the recording factor that relates the voice level to
the recorded signal power as a proportionality constant. This unknown constant
depends on the recording conditions and the post-processing and may thus be
different for each recording (but is constant across each recording). We
provide two approaches to estimate the voice level without knowing the
recording factor. The unknown recording factor can either be learned alongside
the weights of the voice level estimator, or a special loss function based on
the scalar product can be used to only match the contour of the recorded
signal's power. The voice level models are used to condition a previously
introduced bottleneck auto-encoder that disentangles its input, the
mel-spectrogram, from the voice level. We evaluate the voice level models on
recordings annotated with musical dynamic and by their ability to provide
useful information to the auto-encoder. A perceptive test is carried out that
evaluates the perceived change in voice level in transformed recordings and the
synthesis quality. The perceptive test confirms that changing the conditional
input changes the perceived voice level accordingly thus suggesting that the
proposed voice level models encode information about the true voice level.

structures over varying domain sizes. Many works have noticed that MLNs, like
many other relational models, do not admit consistent marginal inference over
varying domain sizes. Furthermore, MLNs learnt on a certain domain do not
generalize to new domains of varied sizes. In recent works, connections have
emerged between domain size dependence, lifted inference and learning from
sub-sampled domains. The central idea to these works is the notion of
projectivity. The probability distributions ascribed by projective models
render the marginal probabilities of sub-structures independent of the domain
cardinality. Hence, projective models admit efficient marginal inference,
removing any dependence on the domain size. Furthermore, projective models
potentially allow efficient and consistent parameter learning from sub-sampled
domains. In this paper, we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions
for a two-variable MLN to be projective. We then isolate a special model in
this class of MLNs, namely Relational Block Model (RBM). We show that, in terms
of data likelihood maximization, RBM is the best possible projective MLN in the
two-variable fragment. Finally, we show that RBMs also admit consistent
parameter learning over sub-sampled domains.

vector field is discontinuous and multi-directional, making an interpretation
of the orientation-based risk indicators unreliable. We improve the evaluation
of longitudinal shear stress by applying the projection of the vessel's
center-line to the surface to construct smooth tangetial field aligned
longitudinaly with the vessel. We validate our approach for the longitudinal
WSS component and the corresponding oscillatory index by comparing them to
results obtained using automatically generated tangents in both rigid and
elastic vessel modeling as well as to amplitude based indicators. The major
benefit of our WSS evaluation based on its longitudinal component for the
cardiovascular risk assessment is the detection of negative WSS indicating
persitent reversal flow. This is impossible in the case of the amplitude-based
WSS.

a method based on Zernike moments and a support vector machine classifier to
automatically identify and track campfires observed by Solar Orbiter/Extreme

campfires (with length scales between 400 km and 4000 km) from a sequence of 50
High Resolution EUV telescope (HRIEUV) 174{\AA} images. From 21 near
co-temporal AIA images covering the same field of view as EUI, we found 1131
campfires, 58% of which were also detected in HRIEUV images. In contrast, about
16% of campfires recognized in HRIEUV were detected by AIA. We obtain a
campfire birthrate of 2*10-16m-2s-1. About 40% of campfires show a duration
longer than 5 s, having been observed in at least two HRIEUV images. We find
that 27% of campfires were found in coronal bright points and the remaining 73%
have occurred out of coronal bright points. We detected 23 EUI campfires with a
duration greater than 245 s. We found that about 80% of campfires are formed at
supergranular boundaries, and the features with the highest total intensities
are generated at network junctions and intense H I Lyman-{\alpha} emission
regions observed by EUI/HRILya. The probability distribution functions for the
total intensity, peak intensity, and projected area of campfires follow a power
law behavior with absolute indices between 2 and 3. This self-similar behavior
is a possible signature of self-organization, or even self-organized

little progress has been made towards a global, cost-efficient, and fair

Agreement's scale. Here, we investigate how different CDR options - AR, BECCS,
and DACCS - might be deployed to meet the Paris Agreement's CDR objectives. We
find that international cooperation in climate mitigation policy is key for
deploying the most cost-efficient CDR pathway - comprised of BECCS, mainly
(74%), and AR (26%) -, allowing to take the most advantage of regional
bio-geophysical resources and socio-economic factors, and time variations, and
therefore minimising costs. Importantly, with international cooperation, the
spatio-temporal evolution of the CDR pathway differs greatly from the
socio-economically fair regional allocation of the Paris Agreement's CDR
objectives. With limited, or no international cooperation, we find that the
likelihood of delivering these CDR objectives decreases, as deploying CDR
pathways becomes significantly more challenging and costly - particularly when
leading to the deployment of DACCS. Moreover, we show that developing
international cooperation policy instruments - such as an international market
for negative emissions trading - can deliver, simultaneously, cost-efficient
and equitable CDR at the Paris Agreement's scale, by incentivising
participating nations to meet their share of the Paris Agreement's CDR
objectives, whilst making up for the uneven distribution of CDR potentials
across the world. Crucially, we conclude that international cooperation is
imperative, as soon as possible, to preserve the feasibility and sustainability
of future CDR pathways, and ensure that future generations do not bear the
burden, increasingly costlier, of climate mitigation inaction.

promise to store and process information at the nanoscale. In the presence of
asymmetric exchange interactions, their chirality, which governs their

voltage can control this key parameter. We probe the chirality of skyrmions and
chiral domain walls by observing the direction of their current-induced motion
and show that a gate voltage can reverse it. This local and dynamical reversal
of the chirality is due to a sign inversion of the interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that we attribute to ionic migration of
oxygen under gate voltage. Micromagnetic simulations show that the chirality
reversal is a continuous transformation, in which the skyrmion is conserved.
This control of chirality with 2 - 3 V gate voltage can be used for

engineering, emphasizing its philosophical elucidation. Generally, it has been
claimed that change is so pervasive in systems that it almost defeats
description and analysis. In this article, we analyze change using the
conceptual modeling technique called a thinging machine (TM), which reflects
change in terms of the actions of creating, processing, releasing,
transferring, and receiving things. We illustrated change in TM modeling with
an example of a system s reconfiguration of business product handling designed
using business process modeling notation (BPMN). Then we analyze the notion of
change and compare its various definitions in philosophy. Specifically, we
examine Zeno s paradox that involves how to account for change and continuity
together in moving things. The problem is that we cannot assert that an arrow
is actually moving when it has been shot from a bow because the arrow needs to
be at a certain place at each point in time, which by definition cannot contain
any duration at all. In our analysis of this problem, we convert the arrow
trajectory into space units called thimacs. In the TM generic actions, two
types of change are identified: state and progression (PROCESS) changes.
Therefore, when an arrow flows to a TM machine that represents a trajectory
space unit, it is rejected, causing it to bounce away to the outside. That is,
the arrow is transferred, arrives, and is transferred back; therefore, the
arrow is never accepted into a thimac in the trajectory at any moment. The
result of such analysis seems to introduce a logical explanation for the notion
of movement discussed in Zeno s puzzles.

  functionals: Role of repulsive non-local correlation",,,"10.1063/5.0095128",,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Proton-transfer (PT) between organic complexes is a common and important
biochemical process. Unfortunately, PT energy barriers are difficult to
accurately predict using density functional theory (DFT); in particular, the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) tends to underestimate PT barriers.
Moreover, PT typically occurs in environments where dispersion forces
contribute to the cohesion of the system; thus, a suitable exchange-correlation
functional should accurately describe both dispersion forces and PT barriers.
This paper provides benchmark results for the PT barriers of several density
functionals including several variants of the van der Waals density functional
(vdWDF). The benchmark set comprises small organic molecules with inter- and
intra-molecular PT. The results show that replacing GGA correlation with a
fully non-local vdW-DF correlation increases the PT barriers, making it closer
to the quantum chemical reference values. In contrast, including nonlocal
correlations with the Vydrov-Voorhis (VV) method or dispersion-corrections at
the DFT-D3 or the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) level has barely any impact on the
PT barriers. Hybrid functionals also increase and improve the energies and the
best performance is provided by a hybrid version of the consistent-exchange van
der Waals density functional vdW-DF-cx. For the formic acid dimer PT system, we
analyzed the GGA exchange and non-local correlation contributions. The analysis
shows that the repulsive part of the non-local correlation kernel plays a key
role in the PT energy barriers predicted with vdW-DF.

lower polariton branch and hence a negative mass. We perform direct
measurements of the anomalous dispersion in atomically thin (monolayer) WS$_2$
crystals embedded in planar microcavities and demonstrate that the propagation
direction of the negative-mass polaritons is opposite to their momentum. Our
study introduces a new concept of non-Hermitian dispersion engineering for
exciton polaritons and opens a pathway for realising new phases of quantum
matter in a solid state.

capture human prior knowledge and insights, there has been little exploration
on how to leverage them for model training and development. With this in mind,
we explore behaviour-aware learning by examining several fine-tuning schemes
using HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection systems.
To address potential pitfalls of training on data originally intended for
evaluation, we train and evaluate models on different configurations of
HateCheck by holding out categories of test cases, which enables us to estimate
performance on potentially overlooked system properties. The fine-tuning
procedure led to improvements in the classification accuracy of held-out
functionalities and identity groups, suggesting that models can potentially
generalise to overlooked functionalities. However, performance on held-out
functionality classes and i.i.d. hate speech detection data decreased, which
indicates that generalisation occurs mostly across functionalities from the
same class and that the procedure led to overfitting to the HateCheck data
distribution.

addition to moving very quickly and often being occluded, the players wear the
same jersey, which makes the task of reidentification very complex. Some recent
tracking methods have been developed more specifically for the team sport
context. Due to the lack of public data, these methods use private datasets
that make impossible a comparison with them. In this paper, we propose a new
generic method to track team sport players during a full game thanks to few
human annotations collected via a semi-interactive system. Non-ambiguous
tracklets and their appearance features are automatically generated with a
detection and a reidentification network both pre-trained on public datasets.
Then an incremental learning mechanism trains a Transformer to classify
identities using few game-specific human annotations. Finally, tracklets are
linked by an association algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of our
approach on a challenging rugby sevens dataset. To overcome the lack of public
sports tracking dataset, we publicly release this dataset at

networking, an SSIC dispatcher at the source dispatches duplicates of packets
over multiple streams, which may be established over different physical
wireless networks. If a packet on a stream cannot be decoded due to wireless
interference or noise, the decoder makes available the packet's soft
information. An aggregator then combines the soft information of the duplicates
to boost reliability. Of importance are two challenges: i) how to descramble
the scrambled soft information from different streams to enable correct SSIC;
ii) the construct of an SSIC dispatching and aggregation framework compatible
with commercial network interface cards (NICs) and TCP/IP networks. To address
the challenges, we put forth: i) a soft descrambling (SD) method to minimize
the bit-error rate (BER) and packet-error rate (PER) at the SSIC's output; ii)
an SSIC networking architecture readily deployable over today's TCP/IP networks

with a model for the privacy risks of DP. The result are privacy notifications
which explain the risk to an individual's privacy when using DP, rather than
DP's functionality. We evaluate these novel privacy communication formats in a

model simulations. These simulations include the control and soil moisture (SM)

(decreasing/increasing) SM from the historical (HIST: 1951-2010) and future 4K
warming (FUT: 2051-2100) control runs. The analysis identifies the transitional
regions of north-central India (NCI) as the hotspot of strong SM-T coupling.
Over NCI, the HIST experiment shows an occurrence of 4-5 extreme events per
year, with an average duration of 5-6 days per event and intensity exceeding
46oC. Whereas, FUT estimates indicate relatively severe, long-lasting, and more
frequent extreme events. The SM sensitivity experiments reveal the significant
influence of SM-T coupling on the ExT over NCI in both historical and future
climates. We find that the DRY-SM results in significant enhancement of
frequency, duration and intensity of ExT, in contrast to WET-SM. We note that
the difference between DRY-SM and WET-SM 50-year return value of the block
maxima GEV fit can reach upto 1.25oC and 3oC for historical and future climate,
respectively. The enhanced (reduced) extreme temperature conditions in DRY-SM
(WET-SM) simulation are caused by the intensification (abridgement) of sensible
heat flux by limiting (intensifying) available total energy for evaporative
cooling due to faster (slower) dissipation of positive soil moisture anomalies
(also called as soil moisture memory). In addition, the influence of SM on ExT
over NCI is found to be larger during the post-monsoon season as compared to
the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons.

claims that (1) the linear ordering of EEs and CCs in Hmong, Lahu, and Chinese
can be predicted via phonological hierarchies and (2) these phonological
hierarchies lack a clear phonetic rationale. These claims are significant
because morphosyntax has often been seen as in a feed-forward relationship with
phonology, and phonological generalizations have often been assumed to be
phonetically ""natural"". We investigate whether the ordering of CCs and EEs can
be learned empirically and whether computational models (classifiers and
sequence labeling models) learn unnatural hierarchies similar to those posited
by Mortensen (2006). We find that decision trees and SVMs learn to predict the
order of CCs/EEs on the basis of phonology, with DTs learning hierarchies
strikingly similar to those proposed by Mortensen. However, we also find that a
neural sequence labeling model is able to learn the ordering of elaborate

Hund's coupling close to integer filling at $n=2$ in two spacial dimensions.
Previously, a Mott metal-insulator transition was established at $n=2$ with a
coexistence region of a metallic and a bad metal state in the vicinity of that
integer filling. The coexistence region ends at a critical point beyond which a
charge instability persists. Here we investigate the transition into negative
electronic compressibility states for an extended filling range close to $n=2$
within a slave boson setup. We analyze the separate contributions from the
(fermionic) quasiparticles and the (bosonic) multiparticle incoherent
background and find that the total compressibility depends on a subtle
interplay between the quasiparticle excitations and collective fields.
Implementing a Blume-Emery-Griffiths model approach for the slave bosons, which
mimics the bosonic fields by Ising-like pseudospins, we suggest a feedback
mechanism between these fields and the fermionic degrees of freedom. We argue
that the negative compressibility can be sustained for heterostructures of such
strongly correlated planes and results in a large capacitance of these
structures. The strong density dependence of these capacitances allows to tune
them through small electronic density variations. Moreover, by resistive
switching from a Mott insulating state to a metallic state through short
electric pulses, transitions between fairly different capacitances are within
reach.

with multiple photonic qubits simultaneously controlling one target photonic
qubit based on circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). For convenience, we
denote this multiqubit gate as MCP gate. The gate is realized by using a
two-level coupler to couple multiple cavities. The coupler here is a
superconducting qubit. This scheme is simple because the gate implementation
requires only \textit{one step} of operation. In addition, this scheme is quite
general because the two logic states of each photonic qubit can be encoded with
a vacuum state and an arbitrary non-vacuum state (e.g., a Fock state, a
superposition of Fock states, a cat state, or a coherent state, etc.) which is
orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal to the vacuum state. The scheme has some
additional advantages: Because only two levels of the coupler are used, i.e.,
no auxiliary levels are utilized, decoherence from higher energy levels of the
coupler is avoided; the gate operation time does not depend on the number of
qubits; and the gate is implemented deterministically because no measurement is
applied. As an example, we numerically analyze the circuit-QED based
experimental feasibility of implementing a three-qubit MCP gate with photonic
qubits each encoded via a vacuum state and a cat state. The scheme can be
applied to accomplish the same task in a wide range of physical system, which
consists of multiple microwave or optical cavities coupled to a two-level
coupler such as a natural or artificial atom.

Extending the NS background fields to a supergravity multiplet, we verify that
all solutions we find are half-supersymmetric. The two perturbative solutions

string is part of the on-shell spectrum of non-relativistic string theory, the
unwound string only makes sense off-shell where it mediates the instantaneous
gravitational force. Seen from the nine-dimensional point of view, we find that
the winding string solution is sourced by a non-relativistic massive particle
and that the unwound string solution is sourced by a massless Galilean particle
of zero colour and spin. We explain how these two string solutions fit into a
discrete lightcone quantization of string theory. We shortly discuss the basic

performance in data synthesis and have driven the development of many
applications. However, GANs are known to be hard to train due to their bilevel
objective, which leads to the problems of convergence, mode collapse, and
gradient vanishing. In this paper, we propose a new generative model called the
generative adversarial NTK (GA-NTK) that has a single-level objective. The
GA-NTK keeps the spirit of adversarial learning (which helps generate plausible
data) while avoiding the training difficulties of GANs. This is done by
modeling the discriminator as a Gaussian process with a neural tangent kernel
(NTK-GP) whose training dynamics can be completely described by a closed-form
formula. We analyze the convergence behavior of GA-NTK trained by gradient
descent and give some sufficient conditions for convergence. We also conduct
extensive experiments to study the advantages and limitations of GA-NTK and
propose some techniques that make GA-NTK more practical.

strongly influenced by the heterogeneous stress distribution at the grain

stresses resolved in the slip systems as the critical driving force for plastic

investigated in the linear elastic regime and at incipient plastic deformations
based on a large ensemble of microstructures. The elastic anisotropy of the
single crystal is found to have a crucial influence on the scatter of the
stress distribution, whereas the Young's modulus in the respective crystal
direction governs the mean stress in the grain. It is further demonstrated
that, for higher anisotropy, the shear stresses deviate from the normal
distribution and are better approximated by a log-normal fit. Comparing the
full-field simulations to the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), reveals that the
MEM provides an excellent prediction up to the second statistical moment in the

the grain boundary is identified as a region of pronounced stress fluctuations

trajectories, locations, or velocities of the targeting particles. The standard
approach of particle tracking consists of two steps: first reconstructing
statically the source locations in each time step, and second applying tracking
techniques to obtain the trajectories and velocities. In contrast, the dynamic
reconstruction seeks to simultaneously recover the source locations and
velocities from all frames, which enjoys certain advantages. In this paper, we
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis for the resolution limit of
reconstructing source number, locations, and velocities by general dynamical
reconstruction in particle tracking problems, by which we demonstrate the
possibility of achieving super-resolution for the dynamic reconstruction. We
show that when the location-velocity pairs of the particles are separated
beyond certain distances (the resolution limits), the number of particles and
the location-velocity pair can be stably recovered. The resolution limits are
related to the cut-off frequency of the imaging system, signal-to-noise ratio,
and the sparsity of the source. By these estimates, we also derive a stability
result for a sparsity-promoting dynamic reconstruction. In addition, we further
show that the reconstruction of velocities has a better resolution limit which
improves constantly as the particles moving. This result is derived by an
observation that the inherent cut-off frequency for the velocity recovery can
be viewed as the total observation time multiplies the cut-off frequency of the
imaging system, which may lead to a better resolution limit as compared to the
one for each diffraction-limited frame. It is anticipated that this observation
can inspire new reconstruction algorithms that improve the resolution of
particle tracking in practice.

most typically occurring in galaxy groups and clusters or around single,
massive galaxies. However, at earlier epochs, ($5 < z < 2$), the collapse of
large scale structure (forming Zel'dovich sheets and subsequently filaments of
the cosmic web) can produce volume-filling accretion shocks which elevate large
swaths of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in these structures to a hot ($T>10^6$
K) phase. We study the impact of such an event on the evolution of central
dwarf galaxies ($5.5 < \log M_* < 8.5$) in the field using a spatially large,
high resolution cosmological zoom simulation which covers the cosmic web
environment between two protoclusters. We find that the shock-heated sheet acts
as an environmental quencher much like clusters and filaments at lower
redshift, creating a population of quenched, central dwarf galaxies. Even
massive dwarfs which do not quench are affected by the shock, with reductions
to their sSFR and gas accretion. This process can potentially explain the
presence of isolated quenched dwarf galaxies, and represents an avenue of
pre-processing, via which quenched satellites of bound systems quench before
infall.

of edge agreement is maximized. We assume in this work that the observed pair
$G,H$ has been drawn from the correlated Wigner model -- a popular model for
correlated weighted graphs -- where the entries of the adjacency matrices of
$G$ and $H$ are independent Gaussians and each edge of $G$ is correlated with
one edge of $H$ (determined by the unknown matching) with the edge correlation
described by a parameter $\sigma\in [0,1)$. In this paper, we analyse the
performance of the projected power method (PPM) as a seeded graph matching
algorithm where we are given an initial partially correct matching (called the
seed) as side information. We prove that if the seed is close enough to the
ground-truth matching, then with high probability, PPM iteratively improves the
seed and recovers the ground-truth matching (either partially or exactly) in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ iterations. Our results prove that PPM works even in
regimes of constant $\sigma$, thus extending the analysis in (Mao et al.,2021)
for the sparse Erd\""os-Renyi model to the (dense) Wigner model. As a byproduct
of our analysis, we see that the PPM framework generalizes some of the
state-of-art algorithms for seeded graph matching. We support and complement

considered in this work. The paper introduces an extension to the well-known

proposed pre-screening relies on the three following components: a specific

meta-model of a fitness function that consists of 6 independent transformations

scalar field, and its black hole solution is given as a perturbative expansion
in a small parameter that measures the deviation from general relativity. The
second one, known as 4-dimensional-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, can be seen as

low-dimensional Hamming cube in an almost isometric way. We construct a simple,
data-oblivious, and computationally efficient map that achieves this task with
high probability: we first apply a specific structured random matrix, which we
call the double circulant matrix; using that matrix requires linear storage and
matrix-vector multiplication can be performed in near-linear time. We then
binarize each vector by comparing each of its entries to a random threshold,
selected uniformly at random from a well-chosen interval.
  We estimate the number of bits required for this encoding scheme in terms of
two natural geometric complexity parameters of the set - its Euclidean covering
numbers and its localized Gaussian complexity. The estimate we derive turns out
to be the best that one can hope for - up to logarithmic terms.
  The key to the proof is a phenomenon of independent interest: we show that
the double circulant matrix mimics the behavior of a Gaussian matrix in two
important ways. First, it maps an arbitrary set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ into a set of
well-spread vectors. Second, it yields a fast near-isometric embedding of any
finite subset of $\ell_2^n$ into $\ell_1^m$. This embedding achieves the same
dimension reduction as a Gaussian matrix in near-linear time, under an optimal
condition - up to logarithmic factors - on the number of points to be embedded.
This improves a well-known construction due to Ailon and Chazelle.

stability is supported by two special properties of its orbit that limit the
location of its perihelion in azimuth and in latitude. We revisit Pluto's

gravitational effects of the giant planets on constraining its perihelion

in a narrow range of additional secular forcing which arises fortuitously from
the particular orbital architecture of the other giant planets. Our

Pluto's orbit is rather surprisingly close to a zone of strong chaos.

produce long duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and that neutron star mergers
generate short hard GRBs. SN-Less GRBs presumably originate in a phase
transition of a neutron star in a high mass X-ray binary. How these phenomena
actually generate GRBs is debated. The fireball and cannonball models of GRBs
and their afterglows have been widely confronted with the huge observational
data, with their defenders claiming success. The claims, however, may reflect
multiple choices and the use of many adjustable parameters, rather than the
validity of the models. Only a confrontation of key falsifiable predictions of
the models with solid observational data can test their validity. Such critical

of the short-lived isotope $^{60}$Fe to the stable isotope $^{56}$Fe of

require the injection of live $^{60}$Fe from a Type II supernova (SN II) into
the presolar molecular cloud core, as the observed ratio is over a factor of
ten times higher than would be expected to be found in the ambient interstellar
medium (ISM) as a result of galactic chemical evolution. The supernova
triggering and injection scenario offers a ready explanation for an elevated
initial $^{60}$Fe level, and in addition provides a physical mechanism for
explaining the non-carbonaceous -- carbonaceous (NC-CC) dichotomy of
meteorites. The NC-CC scenario hypothesizes the solar nebula first accreted
material that was enriched in supernova-derived nuclides, and then later
accreted material depleted in supernova-derived nuclides. While the NC-CC
dichotomy refers to stable nuclides, not short-lived isotopes like $^{60}$Fe,
the SN II triggering hypothesis provides an explanation for the otherwise
unexplained change in nuclides being accreted by the solar nebula. Three
dimensional hydrodynamical models of SN II shock-triggered collapse show that
after triggering collapse of the presolar cloud core, the shock front sweeps
away the local ISM while accelerating the resulting protostar/disk to a speed
of several km/s, sufficient for the protostar/disk system to encounter within
$\sim$ 1 Myr the more distant regions of a giant molecular cloud complex that
might be expected to have a depleted inventory of supernova-derived nuclides.

these textures are directly derived from images, which intrinsically embedded
the spatially and temporally variant environmental lighting information, such
as the sun illumination, direction, causing different looks of the surface,
making such models less realistic when used in 3D rendering under synthetic

environmental lighting, it can, in turn, benefit basic photogrammetric
processing. In this paper, we attack the problem of albedo recovery for aerial
images for the photogrammetric process and demonstrate the benefit of albedo
recovery for photogrammetry data processing through enhanced feature matching
and dense matching. To this end, we proposed an image formation model with
respect to outdoor aerial imagery under natural illumination conditions; we
then, derived the inverse model to estimate the albedo by utilizing the typical
photogrammetric products as an initial approximation of the geometry. The
estimated albedo images are tested in intrinsic image decomposition,

phonons and fast-moving carriers in semiconductor heterostructures can be
accompanied by electron-phonon instabilities that cause ordinary and induced
Cherenkov effects. However, the development of such instabilities is still
poorly understood. Our study shows that other supersonic phenomena, beyond the
Cherenkov instability, are possible for non-equilibrium charge transport in the
miniband semiconductor superlattices (SLs) driven by an acoustic plane wave.
Using semiclassical nonperturbative methods and elements of the bifurcation
theory, we find the conditions for the onset of dynamical instabilities
(bifurcations) which are caused by the emission of specific SL phonons by
supersonic electrons, and their back action on the electrons. Notably, the
underlying radiation mechanism is connected either to normal or anomalous
Doppler effects in full accordance with the Ginzburg-Frank-Tamm theory. The
appearance of induced Doppler effects is also discussed in relation to the
formation of electron bunches propagating through the spatially periodic
structure of the SL. When the amplitude of the acoustic wave exceeds certain
threshold, the dynamical instabilities developed in the system are manifested
as drift velocity reversals, resonances in sound attenuation and absolute
negative mobility. We demonstrate that the discovered superluminal Doppler

  Representation Consistency",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video anomaly detection refers to the identification of events that deviate
from the expected behavior. Due to the lack of anomalous samples in training,
video anomaly detection becomes a very challenging task. Existing methods
almost follow a reconstruction or future frame prediction mode. However, these
methods ignore the consistency between appearance and motion information of
samples, which limits their anomaly detection performance. Anomalies only occur
in the moving foreground of surveillance videos, so the semantics expressed by
video frame sequences and optical flow without background information in
anomaly detection should be highly consistent and significant for anomaly
detection. Based on this idea, we propose Appearance-Motion Semantics
Representation Consistency (AMSRC), a framework that uses normal data's
appearance and motion semantic representation consistency to handle anomaly
detection. Firstly, we design a two-stream encoder to encode the appearance and
motion information representations of normal samples and introduce constraints
to further enhance the consistency of the feature semantics between appearance
and motion information of normal samples so that abnormal samples with low
consistency appearance and motion feature representation can be identified.
Moreover, the lower consistency of appearance and motion features of anomalous
samples can be used to generate predicted frames with larger reconstruction
error, which makes anomalies easier to spot. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

of accurately forecasting novel infectious diseases. When new diseases first
emerge, we have little knowledge of the transmission process, the level and
duration of immunity to reinfection, or other parameters required to build
realistic epidemiological models. Time series forecasts and machine learning,
while less reliant on assumptions about the disease, require large amounts of
data that are also not available in early stages of an outbreak. In this study,
we examine how knowledge of related diseases can help make predictions of new
diseases in data-scarce environments using transfer learning. We implement both
an empirical and a theoretical approach. Using empirical data from Brazil, we
compare how well different machine learning models transfer knowledge between
two different disease pairs: (i) dengue and Zika, and (ii) influenza and
COVID-19. In the theoretical analysis, we generate data using different
transmission and recovery rates with an SIR compartmental model, and then
compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning methods. We find that
transfer learning offers the potential to improve predictions, even beyond a
model based on data from the target disease, though the appropriate source
disease must be chosen carefully. While imperfect, these models offer an
additional input for decision makers during pandemic response.

research feature aims to reveal the temporal and spatial evolution of the

interesting results as follows. (1) The distributions of the numbers for
cumulative confirmed cases and deaths obey power-law in early stages of
COVID-19 and stretched exponential function in subsequent course. (2) The
distributions of the numbers for daily confirmed cases and deaths obey
power-law in early and late stages of COVID-19 and stretched exponential
function in middle stages. The crossover region between power-law and stretched
exponential behaviour seems to depend on the evolution of ""infection"" event and
""death"" event. Such observation implies a kind of important symmetry related to
the dynamics process of COVID-19 spreading. (3) The distributions of the
normalized numbers for each metric show a temporal scaling behaviour in 2-year
period, and are well described by stretched exponential function. The
observation of power-law and stretched exponential behaviour in such
country-level distributions suggests underlying intrinsic dynamics of a virus
spreading process in human interconnected society. And thus it is important for
understanding and mathematically modeling the COVID-19 pandemic.

leading edge of technologies used for classifying objects. However, they
generally demand large amounts of time and data for model training; and their
learned models can sometimes be difficult to interpret. In this paper, we
advance FastMapSVM -- an interpretable Machine Learning framework for
classifying complex objects -- as an advantageous alternative to Neural
Networks for general classification tasks. FastMapSVM extends the applicability
of Support-Vector Machines (SVMs) to domains with complex objects by combining
the complementary strengths of FastMap and SVMs. FastMap is an efficient
linear-time algorithm that maps complex objects to points in a Euclidean space
while preserving pairwise domain-specific distances between them. We
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FastMapSVM in the context of
classifying seismograms. We show that its performance, in terms of precision,
recall, and accuracy, is comparable to that of other state-of-the-art methods.
However, compared to other methods, FastMapSVM uses significantly smaller
amounts of time and data for model training. It also provides a perspicuous
visualization of the objects and the classification boundaries between them. We
expect FastMapSVM to be viable for classification tasks in many other
real-world domains.

intrinsic functional connectivity and assess its integrity in cerebral
development. In neonates, where fMRI is limited to few paradigms, rsfMRI was
shown to be a relevant tool to explore regional interactions of brain networks.
However, to identify the resting state networks, data needs to be carefully
processed. Because of the non-collaborative nature of the neonates, the
differences in brain size and the reversed contrast compared to adults,
neonates can't be processed with the existing adult pipelines. Therefore, we
developed NeoRS. The main processing steps include atlas registration, skull
tripping, segmentation, slice timing and head motion correction and confounds
regression. To address the specificity of neonatal brain imaging, particular
attention was given to registration including neonatal atlas type and
parameters, such as brain size variations, and contrast differences compared to
adults. Furthermore, head motion was scrutinized and optimized, as it is a
major issue when processing neonatal data. The pipeline includes visual quality
control assessment checkpoints. To assess its effectiveness, we used the data
from the Baby Connectome Project including 10 neonates. NeoRS was designed to
work on both multi-band and single-band acquisitions and is applicable on
smaller datasets. It also includes popular functional connectivity analysis
features such as seed based correlations. Language, default mode, dorsal
attention, visual, ventral attention, motor and fronto parietal networks were
evaluated. The different analyzed networks were in agreement with previously
published studies in the neonate. NeoRS is coded in Matlab, it is open-source

discretised representations. Here we consider a specific discretisation of the
continuum complex Hilbert space of quantum mechanics - a discretisation where
squared amplitudes and complex phases are rational numbers. The fineness of
this discretisation is determined by a finite (prime-number) parameter $p$. As
$p \rightarrow \infty$, unlike standard discretised representations in
computational physics, this model does not tend smoothly to the continuum
limit. Instead, the state space of quantum mechanics is a singular limit of the
discretised model at $p=\infty$. Using number theoretic properties of
trigonometric functions, it is shown that for large enough values of $p$,
discretised Hilbert space accurately describes ensemble representations of
quantum systems within an inherently superdeterministic framework, one where
the Statistical Independence assumption in Bell's theorem is formally violated.
In this sense, the discretised model can explain the violation of Bell
inequalities without appealing to nonlocality or indefinite reality. It is
shown that this discretised framework is not fine tuned (and hence not
conspiratorial) with respect to its natural state-space $p$-adic metric. As
described by Michael Berry, old theories of physics are typically the singular
limits of new theories as a parameter of the new theory is set equal to zero or
infinity. Using this, we can answer the challenge posed by Scott Aaronson,
critic of superderminism: to explain when a great theory in physics (here
quantum mechanics) has ever been `grudgingly accommodated' rather than
`gloriously explained' by its candidate successor theory (here a
superdeterministic theory of quantum physics based on discretised Hilbert
space).

equations is very accurate for very small distances on the surface of the earth
in the 1500km range of the Indian subcontinent satellite coverage. When we talk
of accuracy of the GPS system it should be very accurate on the surface of the
earth when used to show changes in coordinate of the moving body with respect
to the ground by the satellite which is situated on the earths orbit. Optical
flow is a method which uses movements with respect to x and y axis for
infinitesimal changes in its coordinates and then uses this algorithm to use it
in global positioning system to find accurate position of the body with respect
to the satellite coordinates with respect to ground positioning. The modern
method of differential frames is also very accurate as it involves
infinitesimal frames which are modelled together from the satellite to find
changes in the coordinates on the earths surface, so we have designed a new
algorithm in this paper on the Optical flow GNSS system which is an alternative
and can improve the study done in the design of these algorithms in this field

Education (AIEd). One of the most common approach to student assessment is
Knowledge Tracing (KT), which evaluates a student's knowledge state by
predicting whether the student will answer a given question correctly or not.
However, in the context of multiple choice (polytomous) questions, conventional
KT approaches are limited in that they only consider the binary (dichotomous)
correctness label (i.e., correct or incorrect), and disregard the specific
option chosen by the student. Meanwhile, Option Tracing (OT) attempts to model
a student by predicting which option they will choose for a given question, but
overlooks the correctness information. In this paper, we propose
Dichotomous-Polytomous Multi-Task Learning (DP-MTL), a multi-task learning
framework that combines KT and OT for more precise student assessment. In
particular, we show that the KT objective acts as a regularization term for OT
in the DP-MTL framework, and propose an appropriate architecture for applying
our method on top of existing deep learning-based KT models. We experimentally
confirm that DP-MTL significantly improves both KT and OT performances, and
also benefits downstream tasks such as Score Prediction (SP).
