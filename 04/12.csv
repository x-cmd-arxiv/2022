distribution (QKD) between two parties. In general, the QKD protocols proposed
for the multiparty scenario often involve the usage of a maximally entangled
state, such as GHZ, which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper
examines the prepare and measure version of multiparty communication through
quantum key distribution. It is sufficient to have the capability of preparing
and measuring a single qubit state. The security of the multiparty prepare and
measure QKD is demonstrated by utilizing the well-known techniques of quantum
error correction and entanglement purification. We begin by establishing the
security of the entangled-based version and progress through a series of
reductions to arrive at our equivalent multiparty prepare and measure version
of QKD. We establish the security proof of multiparty entangled-based version
by combining FTQC and classical statistics on the GHZ basis. Then proved the
conditional security of the multiparty prepare-and-measure QKD by the
equivalency.

distorts the underlying lattice and usually causes the softening of the
associated phonon mode. However, previous studies demonstrated that the
spin-Peierls transition does not always induce an associated phonon softening,
but the central-peak scenario applied in the quasi-one-dimensional compound
CuGeO$_3$. We generalize the lattice-dynamics studies on the two-dimensional
CDW state at van-Hove-singularity (VHS) filling and find that the CDW ordering
could develop a central peak at zero frequency while the associated phonon
undergoes hardening. The particle-hole scatterings between VHS points give rise
to a low-energy increased charge-density susceptibility, and their coupling to
the lattice dynamics induces two poles in the Green function for the
CDW-associated phonon mode. The zero-frequency pole corresponds to the
collective charge-density and phonon coupling mode. The high-frequency one is
related to the high-temperature phonon mode that hardens as reaching the CDW
transition. Our result may have the potential implication for the recently
discovered Kagome metal $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) in which no soft
phonon is observed during the CDW transition.

presented is based on the principles of Photometric Stereo (PS) combined with
Optimum Experimental Design (OED) and Parameter Estimation (PE). Unclear by the
approach of photometric stereo, and many models based thereon, is how to
position the light sources. So far, this is done by using heuristic approaches
this leads to suboptimal and non-data driven positioning of the light sources.
But what if the optimal positions of the light sources are calculated for
photometric stereo? To this end, in this contribution, the effect of
positioning the light sources on the quality of the normal vector for PS is
evaluated. Furthermore, a new approach in this direction is derived and
formulated. For the calculation of the surface normal of a Lambertian surface,
the approach based on calibrated photometric stereo; for the estimation the
optimal position of the light sources the approach is premised on parameter
estimation and optimum experimental design. The approach is tested using
synthetic and real-data. Based on results it can be seen that the surface
normal estimated with the new method is more detailed than with conventional

the life and evolution of galaxies due to the impact they exert on certain
properties and the evolutionary path of galaxies. It is well known that
infrared (IR) emission is useful for selecting galaxies with AGNs, although it
has been observed that there is contamination by star-forming galaxies. Aims.
In this work we investigate galaxy properties hosting AGNs identified at mid
and near-IR wavelengths. The sample of AGNs selected at IR wavelengths was
confirmed using optical spectroscopy and X-ray photometry. We study the
near-UV, optical, near and mid-IR (MIR) properties, as well as [O III]
{\lambda}5007 luminosity, black hole mass and morphology properties of optical
and IR colour selected AGNs. Methods. We selected AGN candidates using two
mid-IR colour selection techniques, a power-law emission method and a
combination of mid and near-IR selection techniques. We confirm the AGN
selection with two line diagnostic diagrams that use the ratio [O III]/H\b{eta}
and the emission line width {\sigma} [O III] (kinematics-excitation diagram,
KEx) and the host galaxy stellar mass (mass-excitation diagram, MEx), as well
as X-ray photometry. Results. According to the diagnostic diagrams, the methods
with the greatest success in selecting AGNs are those that use a combination of
a mid and near-IR selection technique and a power-law emission. The method that
use a combination of mid and near-IR observation selects a large number of
AGNs, and is reasonably efficient in both the success rate (61%) and total
number of AGN recovered. We also find that the KEx method presents
contamination of SF galaxies within the AGN selection box. According to
morphological studies based on the S\'ersic index, AGN samples have higher
percentages of galaxy morphologies with bulge+disk components compared to
galaxies without AGNs.

limited data by leveraging prior knowledge from abundant base data. Generalized
few-shot object detection (G-FSOD) aims to tackle FSOD without forgetting
previously seen base classes and, thus, accounts for a more realistic scenario,
where both classes are encountered during test time. While current FSOD methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, G-FSOD addresses this limitation yet
exhibits a performance drop on novel tasks compared to the state-of-the-art
FSOD. In this work, we propose a constraint-based finetuning approach (CFA) to
alleviate catastrophic forgetting, while achieving competitive results on the
novel task without increasing the model capacity. CFA adapts a continual
learning method, namely Average Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM) to G-FSOD.
Specifically, more constraints on the gradient search strategy are imposed from
which a new gradient update rule is derived, allowing for better knowledge
exchange between base and novel classes. To evaluate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets. Our method
outperforms current FSOD and G-FSOD approaches on the novel task with minor
degeneration on the base task. Moreover, CFA is orthogonal to FSOD approaches
and operates as a plug-and-play module without increasing the model capacity or
inference time.

inference, offloads computation-intensive inference tasks from mobile devices
to edge servers, thereby enhancing the former's capabilities and battery lives.
In a multiuser system, the joint allocation of communication-and-computation
($\text{C}^\text{2}$) resources (i.e., scheduling and bandwidth allocation) is
made challenging by adopting efficient inference techniques, batching and early
exiting, and further complicated by the heterogeneity in users' requirements on
accuracy and latency. Batching groups multiple tasks into one batch for
parallel processing to reduce time-consuming memory access and thereby boosts
the throughput (i.e., completed task per second). On the other hand, early
exiting allows a task to exit from a deep-neural network without traversing the
whole network to support a tradeoff between accuracy and latency. In this work,
we study optimal $\text{C}^\text{2}$ resource allocation with batching and
early exiting, which is an NP-complete integer programming problem. A set of
efficient algorithms are designed under the criterion of maximum throughput by
tackling the challenge. Experimental results demonstrate that both optimal and
sub-optimal $\text{C}^\text{2}$ resource allocation algorithms can leverage
integrated batching and early exiting to double the inference throughput
compared with conventional schemes.

nonlinear flame response of a laminar premixed flame, while carrying out only
one unsteady CFD simulation. The system is excited with a broadband, low-pass
filtered velocity signal that exhibits a uniform distribution of amplitudes
within a predetermined range. The obtained time series of flow velocity
upstream of the flame and heat release rate fluctuations are used to train the
nonlinear model using a multi-layer perceptron. Several models with varying
hyperparameters are trained and the dropout strategy is used as regularizer to
avoid overfitting. The best performing model is subsequently used to compute
the flame describing function (FDF) using mono-frequent excitations. In
addition to accurately predicting the FDF, the trained neural network model
also captures the presence of higher harmonics in the flame response. As a
result, when coupled with an acoustic solver, the obtained neural network model
is better suited than a classical FDF model to predict limit cycle oscillations
characterized by more than one frequency. The latter is demonstrated in the
final part of the present study. We show that the RMS value of the predicted
acoustic oscillations together with the associated dominant frequencies are in
excellent agreement with CFD reference data.

  Information","13 pages of the main text",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Backdoor attacks insert malicious data into a training set so that, during
inference time, it misclassifies inputs that have been patched with a backdoor
trigger as the malware specified label. For backdoor attacks to bypass human
inspection, it is essential that the injected data appear to be correctly
labeled. The attacks with such property are often referred to as ""clean-label
attacks."" Existing clean-label backdoor attacks require knowledge of the entire
training set to be effective. Obtaining such knowledge is difficult or
impossible because training data are often gathered from multiple sources
(e.g., face images from different users). It remains a question whether
backdoor attacks still present a real threat.
  This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question by designing an
algorithm to mount clean-label backdoor attacks based only on the knowledge of
representative examples from the target class. With poisoning equal to or less
than 0.5% of the target-class data and 0.05% of the training set, we can train
a model to classify test examples from arbitrary classes into the target class
when the examples are patched with a backdoor trigger. Our attack works well
across datasets and models, even when the trigger presents in the physical
world.
  We explore the space of defenses and find that, surprisingly, our attack can
evade the latest state-of-the-art defenses in their vanilla form, or after a
simple twist, we can adapt to the downstream defenses. We study the cause of
the intriguing effectiveness and find that because the trigger synthesized by
our attack contains features as persistent as the original semantic features of
the target class, any attempt to remove such triggers would inevitably hurt the
model accuracy first.

Magnetic susceptibility and zero-field heat-capacity measurements indicate that
the compound undergoes antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at the Neel temperature

the AFM ordering is A-type where the Eu ordered moments (Eu$^{2+}$, S= 7/2)
arranged in ab-plane layers are aligned ferromagnetically in the ab plane with
the Eu moments in adjacent layers aligned antiferromagnetically. We also find
that Eu-moment reorientation in the trigonal AFM domains within the ab planes

limits the applicability of MaxEnt optimal control to safety-critical systems.
To remedy this situation, we impose a Gaussian density constraint at a

detection while the payment is being processed and (ii) posterior detection to
block the card retrospectively and avoid further frauds. Since human
verification is often necessary and the payment processing time is limited, the
second task manages the largest volume of transactions. In the literature,
fraud detection challenges and algorithms performance are widely studied but
the very formulation of the problem is never disrupted: it aims at predicting
if a transaction is fraudulent based on its characteristics and the past
transactions of the cardholder. Yet, in posterior detection, verification often
takes days, so new payments on the card become available before a decision is
taken. This is our motivation to propose a new paradigm: posterior fraud
detection with ""future"" information. We start by providing evidence of the
on-time availability of subsequent transactions, usable as extra context to
improve detection. We then design a Bidirectional LSTM to make use of these
transactions. On a real-world dataset with over 30 million transactions, it
achieves higher performance than a regular LSTM, which is the state-of-the-art
classifier for fraud detection that only uses the past context. We also
introduce new metrics to show that the proposal catches more frauds, more
compromised cards, and based on their earliest frauds. We believe that future
works on this new paradigm will have a significant impact on the detection of
compromised cards.

of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The model incorporates the effects of
inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback self-consistently and is
characterized by five free parameters (two for the redshift-dependent
ionization efficiency, two for the ionizing escape fraction, and another for
reionization temperature increment). We constrain these free parameters by
simultaneously matching with various observational probes, e.g., estimates of
the ionized hydrogen fraction, the CMB scattering optical depth and the galaxy
UV luminosity function. In addition, we include the low-density IGM temperature
measurements obtained from Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra at $z \sim 5.5$, a
probe not commonly used for Bayesian analysis of reionization parameters. We
find that the interplay of the various data sets, particularly inclusion of the
temperature data, leads to tightening of the parameter constraints. Our default

other recent studies. We can also derive constraints on the duration of

amplitude of the bump depends strongly upon both the frequency of the type-C
QPO and the hardness ratio, and is correlated with the corona temperature and
anti-correlated with the radio flux at 15 GHz. The characteristic frequency of
the bump is better correlated with a combination of the frequency of the type-C
QPO and the hardness ratio than with the frequency of the type-C QPO alone. The
rms amplitude of the bump generally increases with energy from ~1-2% at ~3 keV
to ~10-15% at ~30 keV. We suggest that the bump and the high-frequency QPO may
be the same variability component but the properties of the corona affect the
coherence of this variability, leading either to a HFQPO when the spectrum is
in the relatively soft $\gamma$ class, or to a bump when the spectrum is in the
hard $\chi$ class. Finally, we discuss the anti-correlation between the rms
amplitude of the bump and the radio flux in the context of the relation between

scenario. We propose an algorithm-hardware co-design approach called MIME. MIME
reuses the weight parameters of a trained parent task and learns task-specific
threshold parameters for inference on multiple child tasks. We find that MIME
results in highly memory-efficient DRAM storage of neural-network parameters
for multiple tasks compared to conventional multi-task inference. In addition,
MIME results in input-dependent dynamic neuronal pruning, thereby enabling
energy-efficient inference with higher throughput on a systolic-array hardware.
Our experiments with benchmark datasets (child tasks)- CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and
Fashion-MNIST, show that MIME achieves ~3.48x memory-efficiency and ~2.4-3.1x
energy-savings compared to conventional multi-task inference in Pipelined task
mode.

learns using pre-collected data without further exploration. Effective offline
RL would be able to accommodate distribution shift and limited data coverage.
However, prior algorithms or analyses either suffer from suboptimal sample
complexities or incur high burn-in cost to reach sample optimality, thus posing
an impediment to efficient offline RL in sample-starved applications.
  We demonstrate that the model-based (or ""plug-in"") approach achieves
minimax-optimal sample complexity without burn-in cost for tabular Markov
decision processes (MDPs). Concretely, consider a finite-horizon (resp.
$\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon) MDP with $S$ states and horizon $H$
(resp. effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$), and suppose the distribution
shift of data is reflected by some single-policy clipped concentrability
coefficient $C^{\star}_{\text{clipped}}$. We prove that model-based offline RL
yields $\varepsilon$-accuracy with a sample complexity of \[ \begin{cases}
\frac{H^{4}SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{\varepsilon^{2}} &
(\text{finite-horizon MDPs})
\frac{SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{(1-\gamma)^{3}\varepsilon^{2}} &
(\text{infinite-horizon MDPs}) \end{cases} \] up to log factor, which is
minimax optimal for the entire $\varepsilon$-range. The proposed algorithms are
``pessimistic'' variants of value iteration with Bernstein-style penalties, and
do not require sophisticated variance reduction. Our analysis framework is
established upon delicate leave-one-out decoupling arguments in conjunction
with careful self-bounding techniques tailored to MDPs.

device manufacturers, scanning protocols, and inter-subject variability. A
conventional way to mitigate MR image heterogeneity is to apply preprocessing
transformations such as anatomy alignment, voxel resampling, signal intensity
equalization, image denoising, and localization of regions of interest.
Although a preprocessing pipeline standardizes image appearance, its influence
on the quality of image segmentation and on other downstream tasks in deep
neural networks has never been rigorously studied.
  We conduct experiments on three publicly available datasets and evaluate the
effect of different preprocessing steps in intra- and inter-dataset training
scenarios. Our results demonstrate that most popular standardization steps add
no value to the network performance; moreover, preprocessing can hamper model
performance. We suggest that image intensity normalization approaches do not
contribute to model accuracy because of the reduction of signal variance with
image standardization. Finally, we show that the contribution of
skull-stripping in data preprocessing is almost negligible if measured in terms
of estimated tumor volume.
  We show that the only essential transformation for accurate deep learning
analysis is the unification of voxel spacing across the dataset. In contrast,
inter-subjects anatomy alignment in the form of non-rigid atlas registration is
not necessary and intensity equalization steps (denoising, bias-field

an embedding based on quantum random access codes. We show that for any

variational linear quantum models that use the quantum random access code

ensemble of such models can represent any function on the Boolean cube with

Gravity (MG) scenarios. We consider two general categories of such MG models,
one is the $f(R)$ gravity, and the other is the normal branch of the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati brane world (nDGP). To measure angular clustering we
construct a set of observer-frame lightcones and resulting mock sky catalogs.
We focus on the area-averaged angular correlation functions, $W_J$, and the
associated reduced cumulants, $S_J\equiv W_J/W_2^{(J-1)}$, and robustly measure
them up to the 9th order using counts-in-cells (CIC). We find that $0.15 < z <
0.3$ is the optimal redshift range to maximize the MG signal in our lightcones.
Analyzing various scales for the two types of statistics, we identify up to
20\% relative departures in MG measurements from general relativity (GR), with
varying signal significance. For the case of halos and galaxies, we find that
$3$rd order statistics offer the most sensitive probe of the different
structure formation scenarios, with both $W_3$ and the reduced skewness, $S_3$,
reaching from $2\sigma$ to $4\sigma$ significance at angular scales $\theta
\sim 0.13 ^\circ$. The MG clustering of the smooth dark matter field is
characterized by even stronger deviations ($\stackrel{>}{{}_\sim} 5\sigma$)
from GR, albeit at a bit smaller scales of $\theta\sim0.08^\circ$, where
baryonic physics is already important. Finally, we stress out that our mock
halo and galaxy catalogs are characterized by rather low surface number
densities when compared to existing and forthcoming state-of-the-art
photometric surveys. This opens up exciting potential for testing GR and MG
using angular clustering in future applications, with even higher precision and
significance than reported here.

goal in machine learning -- being able to generalize beyond the training
distribution. In this paper, we take into account both shift types and
introduce full-spectrum OOD (FS-OOD) detection, a more realistic problem
setting that considers both detecting semantic shift and being tolerant to
covariate shift; and designs three benchmarks. These new benchmarks have a more
fine-grained categorization of distributions (i.e., training ID,
covariate-shifted ID, near-OOD, and far-OOD) for the purpose of more
comprehensively evaluating the pros and cons of algorithms. To address the
FS-OOD detection problem, we propose SEM, a simple feature-based semantics
score function. SEM is mainly composed of two probability measures: one is
based on high-level features containing both semantic and non-semantic
information, while the other is based on low-level feature statistics only
capturing non-semantic image styles. With a simple combination, the
non-semantic part is cancelled out, which leaves only semantic information in
SEM that can better handle FS-OOD detection. Extensive experiments on the three

small, cold gas clouds contributing significantly to the total mass embedded in
pressure equilibrium with a hotter, more diffuse volume-filling component.
Modeling this multi-phase state in cosmological simulations poses a significant
challenge due to the requirements to spatially resolve the clouds and
consequently the interactions between the phases. In this paper, we present a
novel method to model this gas state in cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations. We solve the compressible two-fluid hydrodynamic equations using a
moving-mesh finite-volume method and define mass, momentum and energy exchange
terms between the phases as operator-split source terms. Using a stratified
flow model, our implementation is able to maintain volume fraction
discontinuities in pressure equilibrium to machine precision, allowing for the
treatment of both resolved and unresolved multi-phase fluids. The solver
remains second order accurate on smooth hydrodynamics problems. We use the
source and sink terms of an existing two-phase model for the interstellar
medium to demonstrate the value of this type of approach in simulations of
galaxy formation, compare it to its effective equation of state implementation,
and discuss its advantages in future large-scale simulations of galaxy
formation.

[Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe], and flat gradients beyond. By contrast, the red GCs
show a much shallower gradient in [Z/H], which is entirely driven by [Fe/H]. We
use GC-tagged Illustris simulations to demonstrate an accretion scenario where
more massive satellites (with more metal- and $\alpha$-rich GCs) sink further
into the central galaxy than less massive ones, and where the gradient
flattening occurs because of the low GC occupation fraction of low-mass dwarfs
disrupted at larger distances. The dense environment around M87 may also cause
the steep [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient of the blue GCs, mirroring what is seen in the
dwarf galaxy population. The progenitors of red GCs have a narrower mass range
than those of blue GCs, which makes their gradients shallower. We also explore
spatial inhomogeneity in GC abundances, finding that the red GCs to the
northwest of M87 are slightly more metal-rich. Future observations of GC

supermassive black hole masses ($M_{BH}$) for a large sample of ultra-hard
X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as part of the second data release
of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS/DR2). Our catalog includes $M_{BH}$
estimates for a total 689 AGNs, determined from the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$,
$MgII\lambda2798$, and/or $CIV\lambda1549$ broad emission lines. The core
sample includes a total of 512 AGNs drawn from the 70-month Swift/BAT all-sky
catalog. We also provide measurements for 177 additional AGNs that are drawn
from deeper Swift/BAT survey data. We study the links between $M_{BH}$
estimates and line-of-sight obscuration measured from X-ray spectral analysis.
We find that broad H$\alpha$ emission lines in obscured AGNs ($\log (N_{\rm
H}/{\rm cm}^{-2})> 22.0$) are on average a factor of $8.0_{-2.4}^{+4.1}$
weaker, relative to ultra-hard X-ray emission, and about $35_{-12}^{~+7}$\%
narrower than in unobscured sources (i.e., $\log (N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) <
21.5$). This indicates that the innermost part of the broad-line region is
preferentially absorbed. Consequently, current single-epoch $M_{BH}$
prescriptions result in severely underestimated ($>$1 dex) masses for Type 1.9
sources (AGNs with broad H$\alpha$ but no broad H$\beta$) and/or sources with
$\log (N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) > 22.0$. We provide simple multiplicative

asymmetric transverse momentum broadening of a propagating parton in an
inhomogeneous medium. Such broadening is studied within a path integral
description of the evolution of the Wigner distribution for a propagating
parton in medium. Going beyond the eikonal approximation of multiple
scattering, the evolution operator in the transverse direction can be expressed
as the functional integration over all classical trajectories of a massive
particle with the light-cone momentum $\omega$ as its mass. With a dipole
approximation of the Wilson line correlation function, evolution with the
light-cone time $t$ is determined by the jet transport coefficient $\hat q$
that can vary with space and time. In a uniform medium with a constant $\hat
q_0$, the analytical solution to the Wigner distribution becomes a typical
drifted Gaussian in both transverse momentum and coordinate with the diffusion
width $\sqrt{\hat q_0t}$ and $\sqrt{\hat q_0t^3/3\omega^2}$, respectively. In
the case of a simple Gaussian-like transverse inhomogeneity with a spatial
width $\sigma$ on top of a uniform medium, the final asymmetrical momentum
distribution can be calculated semi-analytically. The transverse asymmetry
defined for jet gradient tomography that characterizes the asymmetrical
distribution is found to linearly correlate with the initial transverse
position of the propagating parton within the domain of the inhomogeneity. It
decreases with the parton energy $\omega$, increases with the propagation time
initially and saturates when the diffusion distance is much larger than the
size of the inhomogeneity or $t^3\gg 3\omega^2\sigma^2/\hat q_0$. The
transverse momentum broadening due to the inhomogeneity also saturates at late
time in contrast to the continued increase with time if the drifted diffusion
in space is ignored.

either canonical or microcanonical boundary conditions, as has been done
previously for black hole ensembles. The partition function and the density of
states are expressed as integrals over paths in the constrained, spherically
reduced phase space of pure 3+1 dimensional gravity with a positive
cosmological constant. Issues related to the domain and contour of integration
are analyzed, and the adopted choices for those are justified as far as

this viewpoint, why it computes the dimension of the Hilbert space of states

defines the angular resolution and S/N required for a robust characterization
of the dynamical state of galaxies up to the EoR. The final aim is to help
design spatially-resolved surveys targeting emission lines of primeval
galaxies. We investigate the [CII]-158um emission from z~6-7 LBGs from the
SERRA cosmological simulation, covering a range of dynamical states: from disks
to major mergers. We create ALMA mock observations with various data quality
and apply the kinematic classification methods used in the literature. These
tests allow us to quantify the performances of such methods as a function of
angular resolution and S/N. We find that barely-resolved observations do not
allow the correct dynamical characterization of a galaxy, resulting in the
misclassification of all disks in our sample. However, even when using
spatially-resolved observations with data quality typical of high-z galaxies,
the standard kinematic classification methods, based on the analysis of the
moment maps, fail to distinguish a merger from a disk. The high angular
resolution and S/N needed to apply these standard methods successfully can be
achieved with current data only for a handful of bright galaxies. We propose a
new classification method, called PVsplit, that quantifies the asymmetries and
morphological features in position-velocity diagrams using three empirical
parameters. We test PVsplit on our mock data concluding that it can predict
whether a galaxy is a disk or a merger provided that S/N $\gtrsim10$, and the
major axis is covered by $\gtrsim3$ independent resolution elements.

structure deformations in Type IIB and F-theory flux compactifications is
severely obstructed by the tadpole bound on the fluxes. More precisely, it
states that the stabilization of a large number of moduli requires a flux
background with a tadpole that scales linearly in the number of stabilized
fields. Restricting to the asymptotic regions of the complex structure moduli
space, we give the first conceptual argument that explains this linear scaling
setting and clarifies why it sets in only for a large number of stabilized
moduli. Our approach relies on the use of asymptotic Hodge theory. In
particular, we use the fact that in each asymptotic regime an orthogonal
sl(2)-block structure emerges that allows us to group fluxes into
sl(2)-representations and decouple complex structure directions. We show that
the number of stabilized moduli scales with the number of sl(2)-representations
supported by fluxes, and that each representation fixes a single modulus.
Furthermore, we find that for Calabi-Yau four-folds all but one representation
can be identified with representations occurring on two-folds. This allows us
to discuss moduli stabilization explicitly and establish the relevant scaling
constraints for the tadpole.

This is a spontaneous release of the scalar hair of the newly formed black hole

be either continuously connected to the Schwarzschild black hole, or the

J1823$-$3021K are millisecond pulsars with period of respectively 4.319 ms and
2.768 ms. PSR J1823$-$3021J is mildly recycled with a period of 20.899 ms, and

J1823$-$3021I, J1823$-$3021J, and J1823$-$3021K have position and dispersion

associated with NGC 6624. Pulsar J1823$-$3022 is the only pulsar bright enough
to be re-detected in archival observations of the cluster. This allowed the
determination of a timing solution that spans over two decades. It is not

GC given the long period and large offset in position ($\sim 3$ arcminutes) and
DM (with a fractional difference of 11 percent compared the average of the

the TRAPUM backend to generate multiple beams in the same field of view which
allows sensitive searches to be performed over a few half-light radii from the
cluster center and can simultaneously localise the discoveries. The discoveries
reflect the properties expected for pulsars in core-collapsed GCs.

spectra without significant transmission - with several simulations from the
Cosmic Reionization On Computers (CROC) project. CROC simulations in largest
available boxes (120 cMpc) come close to matching both the distribution of mean
opacities and the frequency of dark gaps, but alas not in the same model: the
run that matches the mean opacities fails to contain enough dark gaps and vice
versa.:( Never-the-less, the run that matches the dark gap distributions serves
as a counter-example to claims in the literature that the dark gap statistics
requires a late end to reionization - in that run reionization ends at z=6.7
(likely too early).
  While multiple factors contribute to the frequency of large dark gaps in the
simulations, the primary factor that controls the overall shape of the dark gap
distribution is the ionization level in voids - the lowest density regions
produce the highest transmission spikes that terminate long gaps. As the
result, the dark gap distribution correlates strongly with the fraction of the
spectrum above the gap detection threshold, the observed distribution is
matched by the simulation in which this fraction is 2%. Hence, the gap
distribution by itself does not constrain the timing of reionization.

circumstances it is possible to exponentially accelerate the approach to
stationarity by performing a unitary transformation of the initial state. This
phenomenon can be regarded as the quantum version of the so-called Mpemba
effect. The transformation of the initial state removes its overlap with the
dynamical mode of the open system dynamics that possesses the slowest decay
rate and thus determines the spectral gap. While this transformation can be
exactly constructed in some cases, it is in practice challenging to implement.
Here we show that even far simpler transformations constructed by a global
unitary spin rotation allow to exponentially speed up relaxation. We
demonstrate this using simple dissipative quantum spin systems, which are
relevant for current quantum simulation and computation platforms based on

feedback, star formation, outflows, accretion, and radial transport in disks.
The velocity dispersion of gas in galaxies therefore offers a promising
observational window into these processes. However, the relative importance of
each of these mechanisms remains controversial. In this work we revisit the
possibility that turbulence on galactic scales is driven by the direct impact
of accreting gaseous material on the disk. We measure this effect in a
disk-like star-forming galaxy in IllustrisTNG, using the high-resolution
cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation TNG50. We employ Lagrangian
tracer particles with a high time cadence of only a few Myr to identify
accretion and other events, such as star formation, outflows, and movement
within the disk. The energies of particles as they arrive in the disk are
measured by stacking the events in bins of time before and after the event. The
average effect of each event is measured on the galaxy by fitting explicit
models for the kinetic and turbulent energies as a function of time in the
disk. These measurements are corroborated by measuring the cross-correlation of
the turbulent energy in the different annuli of the disk with other time
series, and searching for signals of causality, i.e. asymmetries in the
cross-correlation across zero time lag. We find that accretion contributes to
the large-scale turbulent kinetic energy even if it is not the dominant driver
of turbulence in this $\sim 5 \times 10^{9} M_\odot$ stellar mass galaxy.
Extrapolating this finding to a range of galaxy masses, we find that there are
regimes where energy from direct accretion may dominate the turbulent energy
budget, particularly in disk outskirts, galaxies less massive than the Milky
Way, and at redshift $\sim 2$.

attracted wide research interest in the past and is well studied in polymer
physics. Recent seminal works on DNA in confined devices have shown that these
long biopolymers tend to collapse under an external field, contrary to the
previously reported stretching. These long folded structures have a tendency to
form knots that has profound implications in gene regulation and various other
biological functions. These knots have been mechanically induced via optical
tweezers, nanochannel confinement, etc., until recently, where uniform field
driven compression lead to self entanglement of DNA. In this work, we capture
the compression of a confined semiflexible polymer under direct and oscillating
fields, using a coarse-grained computer simulation model in the presence of
long-range hydrodynamics. Within this framework, we show that subjected to
direct field, chains in stronger confinements exhibit substantial compaction,
contrary to the one in moderate confinements or bulk, where such compaction is
absent. Interestingly, an alternating field within an optimum frequency can
effectuate this compression even in moderate or no confinement. Additionally,
we show that the bending rigidity has a profound influence on the chains
folding favourability under direct and alternating fields. This field induced
collapse is a quintessential hydrodynamic phenomenon, resulting in intertwined
knotted structures, even for shorter chains, unlike DNA knotting experiments,
where it happens exclusively for longer chains.

its production, if a pion is absorbed in the nuclear matter, the event may
become indistinguishable from quasi-elastic scattering process and acts as a
background. The estimation of this background is very essential for oscillation

primary vertex and after FSI. Due to FSI, the number of final state pions is
significantly different from the number produced at primary vertex. As the
neutrino detectors can observe only the final state particles, the correct
information about the particles produced at the primary vertex is overshadowed
by FSI. To overcome this difficulty, a good knowledge of FSI is required which

Different types of practitioners (e.g., project managers and clients) get

well-written & well-structured release notes and organizing appropriate
information regarding different targeted users' needs. For that reason,
practitioners face difficulties in writing and reading the release notes using
existing tools. To mitigate these problems, we execute two different studies in
our paper. First, we execute an exploratory study by analyzing 3,347 release

In
recent works, pre-trained language models are often used to achieve
state-of-the-art results, especially when training data is scarce. It is common
to fine-tune on the downstream task, usually by adding task-specific layers on
top of the model. In this paper, we focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis,
which involves extracting aspect term, category, and predicting their
corresponding polarities. In particular, we are interested in few-shot
settings. We propose to reformulate the extraction and prediction tasks into
the sequence generation task, using a generative language model with
unidirectional attention (GPT2 is used unless stated otherwise). This way, the
model learns to accomplish the tasks via language generation without the need
of training task-specific layers. Our evaluation results on the single-task
polarity prediction show that our approach outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art (based on BERT) on average performance by a large margins in
few-shot and full-shot settings. More importantly, our generative approach
significantly reduces the model variance caused by low-resource data. We
further demonstrate that the proposed generative language model can handle
joint and multi-task settings, unlike previous work. We observe that the
proposed sequence generation method achieves further improved performances on
polarity prediction when the model is trained via joint and multi-task
settings. Further evaluation on similar sentiment analysis datasets, SST-2,
SST- and OOS intent detection validates the superiority and noise robustness of
generative language model in few-shot settings.

that the drift velocity vanishes above a critical threshold, here our focus is
on fluctuations, characterized by the variance of the transit times. On the
random comb, the variance is calculated exactly for a given realization of
disorder using a 'forward transport' limit which prohibits backward movement
along the backbone but allows an arbitrary number of excursions into
random-length branches. The disorder-averaged variance diverges at an earlier
threshold of the bias, implying a regime of anomalous fluctuations, although
the velocity is nonzero. Our results are verified numerically using a Monte
Carlo procedure that is adapted to account for ultra-slow returns from long
branches. On the Bethe lattice, we derive an upper bound for the critical
threshold bias for anomalous fluctuations of the mean transit time averaged
over disorder realizations. Finally, as for the passage to the vanishing
velocity regime, it is shown that the transition to the anomalous fluctuation
regime can change from continuous to first order depending on the distribution

receding horizon optimization problem with periodic quadratic cost and

inlet roads, whereas the cost parameters are periodically changed with time.

of manure excesses but later by the Haber-Bosch industrial process. The use of
such fertilizers has increased the atmospheric abundance of nitrogen-containing
species such as NH$_3$ and N$_2$O as agricultural productivity intensifies in
many parts of the world. Both NH$_3$ and N$_2$O are effective greenhouse gases,
and the combined presence of these gases in the atmosphere of a habitable

Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO; Czerny & Hryniewicz 2011). In
this scheme, frequent high-velocity impacts of BLR clouds falling back onto the

the black-hole mass, accretion rate, and metallicity and they range from a few

ultraviolet background (UVB) is weak, the ionization timescale
$t_\mathrm{ion}\equiv \Gamma^{-1}$ exceeds the Hubble time. Assuming
photoionization equilibrium in such regions artificially boosts the ionization
rate, accelerating reionization. By contrast, the recombination time
$t_\mathrm{rec} < t_\mathrm{ion}$ in photoionized regions, with the result that
assuming photoionization equilibrium artificially increases the neutral
hydrogen fraction. Using snapshots between $8 \geq z \geq 5$, we compare the
predicted Lyman-$\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum with and without the
assumption of ionization equilibrium. Small scales ($k > 0.1$ rad s km$^{-1}$)
exhibit reduced power from $7 \leq z \leq 5.5$ in the ionization equilibrium
case while larger scales are unaffected. This occurs for the same reasons:
ionization equilibrium artificially suppresses the neutral fraction in
self-shielded gas and boosts ionizations in voids, suppressing small-scale
fluctuations in the ionization field. When the volume-averaged neutral fraction
drops below $10^{-4}$, the signature of non-equilibrium ionizations on the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (LAF) disappears. Comparing with recent observations
indicates that these non-equilibrium effects are not yet observable in the LAF

formal verification of complex embedded and cyber-physical systems. In this
paper, we study the problem of designing a scalable constraints solver for an
important class of constraints named polynomial constraint inequalities (also
known as non-linear real arithmetic theory). In this paper, we introduce a
solver named PolyARBerNN that uses convex polynomials as abstractions for
highly nonlinear polynomials. Such abstractions were previously shown to be
powerful to prune the search space and restrict the usage of sound and complete
solvers to small search spaces. Compared with the previous efforts on using
convex abstractions, PolyARBerNN provides three main contributions namely (i) a
neural network guided abstraction refinement procedure that helps selecting the
right abstraction out of a set of pre-defined abstractions, (ii) a Bernstein
polynomial-based search space pruning mechanism that can be used to compute
tight estimates of the polynomial maximum and minimum values which can be used
as an additional abstraction of the polynomials, and (iii) an optimizer that
transforms polynomial objective functions into polynomial constraints (on the
gradient of the objective function) whose solutions are guaranteed to be close
to the global optima. These enhancements together allowed the PolyARBerNN

shared backbone to extract features for both things (countable classes such as

to capture the rich relations among them, which can be utilized to enhance
visual understanding and segmentation performance. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a novel Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module to
exploit such contexts. First, we generate panoptic encodings to summarize key
features of the semantic classes and predicted instances. A Panoptic Relational
Attention (PRA) module is then applied to the encodings and the global feature
map from the backbone. It produces a feature map that captures 1) the relations
across semantic classes and instances and 2) the relations between these
panoptic categories and spatial features. PISR also automatically learns to
focus on the more important instances, making it robust to the number of
instances used in the relational attention module. Moreover, PISR is a general
module that can be applied to any existing panoptic segmentation architecture.
Through extensive evaluations on panoptic segmentation benchmarks like
Cityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we show that PISR attains considerable
improvements over existing approaches.

of H$\alpha$ emission, hint that young massive planets are abundant at wide
separations in protoplanetary discs. Here, we show how these observations can
probe the runaway phase of planetary growth in the Core Accretion theory.
Planets in this phase have the right range of masses to account for the
predominantly moderate contrast gaps and rings seen in ALMA observations.
However, we find that these planets gain mass and migrate inward very rapidly.
As a result, the phase when they could produce gaps with properties similar to
those observed is very short, i.e., $t_{\rm gap} \lesssim 0.1$~Myr,
independently of the disc viscosity parameter. This would require many tens to
hundreds of gas giant planets to be born per ALMA system, violating the
available mass budget of solids in realistic discs. This also predicts
preponderance of discs with very wide gaps or complete inner disc holes, which
is not observed. We show that suppression of both planet accretion and
migration by a factor of at least ten is a possible solution to these serious
problems. Future population synthesis models of planet formation should aim to
address both exoplanetary data of older discless planetary systems and ALMA
discs with embedded planets in one framework.

wigglers and optical amplifiers. A number of variations on the original OSC
concept have been proposed, and while a variety of proof-of-principle
demonstrations and operational uses have been considered, the concept was not
experimentally demonstrated up to now [4-9]. An OSC R&D program has been
underway at IOTA for the past several years [4]. Run #3 of the IOTA ring, which

demonstrating and characterizing the OSC physics with the major outcomes
including strong cooling in one, two and three dimensions, validation of the

prior research has been on the double perovskite iridates Ba$_2$YIrO$_6$ and
Sr$_2$YIrO$_6$, where the nature of the ground states (i.e. ordered vs
non-magnetic) is still controversial. Here we present neutron powder
diffraction, high energy resolution fluorescence detected x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS), resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), magnetic
susceptibility, and muon spin relaxation data on the related double perovskite
iridates Ba$_2$LuIrO$_6$, Sr$_2$LuIrO$_6$, Ba$_2$ScIrO$_6$, and Sr$_2$ScIrO$_6$
that enable us to gain a general understanding of the electronic and magnetic
properties for this family of materials. Our HERFD-XAS and RIXS measurements
establish $J = 0$ electronic ground states for the Ir$^{5+}$ ions in all cases,
with similar values for Hund's coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the spin-orbit coupling
constant $\lambda_{\rm SOC}$. Our bulk susceptibility and muon spin relaxation
data find no evidence for long-range magnetic order or spin freezing, but they
do reveal weak magnetic signals that are consistent with extrinsic local
moments. Our results indicate that the large $\lambda_{\rm SOC}$ is the key
driving force behind the electronic and magnetic ground states realized in the
5$d^4$ double perovskite iridates, which agrees well with conventional wisdom.

concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained just using a

for five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations
exceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga

formulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design.
Finally, we report on how these formulations were used in the construction of

Green's function (DSGF) approach, which is a volume integral numerical method
based on fluctuational electrodynamics. This method is applicable to finite,
three-dimensional objects, and all system interactions are defined independent
of thermal excitation by a generalized system Green's function. The DSGF method
is deemed suitable to model NFRHT between irregularly shaped particles after
verification against the analytical solution for chains of two and three SiO2
spheres. The NFRHT results reveal that geometric irregularity in particles
leads to a reduction of the total conductance from that of comparable perfect
spheres at vacuum separation distances smaller than the particle size, a regime
in which NFRHT is a surface phenomenon. At vacuum separation distances larger
than the particle size, NFRHT becomes a volumetric process, and the total
conductance between irregularly shaped particles converges to that of
comparable perfect spheres. Spectral analysis reveals, however, that particle
irregularity leads to damping and broadening of resonances at all separation
distances, thereby highlighting the importance of the DSGF method for spectral
engineering in the near field. The reduced spectral coherence when particle
size is larger than the vacuum separation distance is attributed to coupling of
surface phonon-polaritons within the randomly generated, distorted particle
features. For particle size smaller than the vacuum separation distance,
resonance broadening and damping is linked with the multiple localized surface
phonon modes supported by the composite spherical harmonic morphologies of the

challenges can be identified in applying machine learning for chatter detection
at large in industry: an insufficient understanding of the universality of
chatter features across different processes, the need for automating feature
extraction, and the existence of limited data for each specific
workpiece-machine tool combination. These three challenges can be grouped under
the umbrella of transfer learning. This paper studies automating chatter
detection by evaluating transfer learning of prominent as well as novel chatter
detection methods. We investigate chatter classification accuracy using a
variety of features extracted from turning and milling experiments with
different cutting configurations. The studied methods include Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT), Power Spectral Density (PSD), the Auto-correlation Function
(ACF), Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), and Ensemble Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EEMD). We also examine more recent approaches based on

Discrete Time Warping (DTW). We evaluate the transfer learning potential of
each approach by training and testing both within and across the turning and
milling data sets. Our results show that carefully chosen time-frequency
features can lead to high classification accuracies albeit at the cost of
requiring manual pre-processing and the tagging of an expert user. On the other
hand, we found that the TDA and DTW approaches can provide accuracies and F1

broker is allowed to not offer a contract to some of the potential clients,
thus choosing her portfolio of clients strategically. We find a computationally
tractable characterization of the optimal portfolios of clients (up to a
digital optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently if the number of
potential clients is small) and conduct numerical experiments which illustrate
how these portfolios, as well as the equilibrium profits of all market

in a network of interconnected signaled lanes/roads. The proposed scheme is
emergency vehicle-centered, meaning that it provides an efficient and timely
routing for emergency vehicles. In the proposed scheme, model predictive
control is utilized to control inlet traffic flows by means of network gates,
as well as configuration of traffic lights across the network. Two schemes are
considered in this paper: i) centralized; and ii) decentralized. In the
centralized scheme, a central unit controls the entire network. This scheme
provides the optimal solution, even though it might not fulfil real-time
computation requirements for large networks. In the decentralized scheme, each
intersection has its own control unit, which sends local information to an
aggregator. The main responsibility of this aggregator is to receive local
information from all control units across the network as well as the emergency
vehicle, to augment the received information, and to share it with the control
units. Since the decision-making in decentralized scheme is local and the
aggregator should fulfil the above-mentioned tasks during a traffic cycle which
takes a long period of time, the decentralized scheme is suitable for large
networks, even though it may provide a sub-optimal solution. Extensive
simulation studies are carried out to validate the proposed schemes, and assess
their performance. Notably, the obtained results reveal that traveling times of
emergency vehicles can be reduced up to ~50% by using the centralized scheme
and up to ~30% by using the decentralized scheme, without causing congestion in
other lanes.

The magnetic power distributions are organized in a new coordinate determined
by wavevectors (k) and background magnetic field ($b_0$) in Fourier space. This
study utilizes two approaches to determine wavevectors: singular value
decomposition method and timing analysis. The combination of the two methods
allows an examination of magnetic field properties in terms of mode
compositions without any spatiotemporal hypothesis. Observations show that
fluctuations ($\delta B_{\perp1}$) in the direction perpendicular to k and
$b_0$ prominently cascade perpendicular to $b_0$, and such anisotropy increases
with wavenumber. The reduced power spectra of $\delta B_{\perp1}$ follow
Goldreich-Sridhar scalings: $P(k_\perp)\sim k_\perp^{-5/3}$ and $P(k_{||}) \sim
k_{||}^{-2}$. In contrast, fluctuations within $kb_0$ plane show isotropic
behaviors: perpendicular power distributions are approximately the same as
parallel distributions. The reduced power spectra of fluctuations within $kb_0$
plane follow the scalings: $P(k_\perp)\sim k_\perp^{-3/2}$ and $P(k_{||})\sim
k_{||}^{-3/2}$. Comparing frequency-wavevector spectra with theoretical
dispersion relations of MHD modes, we find that $\delta B_{\perp1}$ are
probably associated with Alfven modes. Moreover, for the Alfv\'enic component,
the ratio of cascading time to the wave period is found to be a factor of a
few, consistent with critical balance in the strong turbulence regime. The
magnetic field fluctuations within $kb_0$ plane more likely originate from fast
modes based on isotropic behaviors.

been seen as an energy-efficient counterpart of ANNs, a quantitative comparison
between the training cost of SNNs and ANNs is missing. To address the
aforementioned issues, in this work, we introduce SATA (Sparsity-Aware Training

provides a simple and re-configurable systolic-based accelerator architecture,
which makes it easy to analyze the training energy for BPTT-based SNN training
algorithms. By utilizing the sparsity, SATA increases its computation energy
efficiency by $5.58 \times$ compared to the one without using sparsity. Based
on SATA, we show quantitative analyses of the energy efficiency of SNN training
and compare the training cost of SNNs and ANNs. The results show that, on
Eyeriss-like systolic-based architecture, SNNs consume $1.27\times$ more total
energy with sparsities when compared to ANNs. We find that such high training
energy cost is from time-repetitive convolution operations and data movements
during backpropagation. Moreover, to propel the future SNN training algorithm
design, we provide several observations on energy efficiency for different
SNN-specific training parameters and propose an energy estimation framework for
SNN training. Code for our framework is made publicly available.

explanation method that provides a gradient activation heat map as an
explanation for Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models. The drawback of this
method is that it cannot be used to generalize CNN behaviour. In this paper, we
present a novel method that extends Grad-CAM from example-based explanations to
a method for explaining global model behaviour. This is achieved by introducing
two new metrics, (i) Mean Observed Dissimilarity (MOD) and (ii) Variation in
Dissimilarity (VID), for model generalization. These metrics are computed by
comparing a Normalized Inverted Structural Similarity Index (NISSIM) metric of
the Grad-CAM generated heatmap for samples from the original test set and
samples from the adversarial test set. For our experiment, we study adversarial
attacks on deep models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101, and wide models
such as InceptionNetv3 and XceptionNet using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM).
We then compute the metrics MOD and VID for the automatic face recognition
(AFR) use case with the VGGFace2 dataset. We observe a consistent shift in the
region highlighted in the Grad-CAM heatmap, reflecting its participation to the
decision making, across all models under adversarial attacks. The proposed
method can be used to understand adversarial attacks and explain the behaviour
of black box CNN models for image analysis.

the statistical properties of non-Gaussian density fields. Recently, many
different statistics have been proposed to extract information from
non-Gaussian cosmological fields that perform better than the power spectrum.
The Fisher matrix formalism is commonly used to quantify the accuracy with
which a given statistic can constrain the value of the cosmological parameters.
However, these calculations typically rely on the assumption that the
likelihood of the considered statistic follows a multivariate Gaussian
distribution. In this work we follow Sellentin & Heavens (2017) and use two
different statistical tests to identify non-Gaussianities in different
statistics such as the power spectrum, bispectrum, marked power spectrum, and
wavelet scatering transform (WST). We remove the non-Gaussian components of the
different statistics and perform Fisher matrix calculations with the
\textit{Gaussianized} statistics using Quijote simulations. We show that
constraints on the parameters can change by a factor of $\sim 2$ in some cases.
We show with simple examples how statistics that do not follow a multivariate
Gaussian distribution can achieve artificially tight bounds on the cosmological
parameters when using the Fisher matrix formalism. We think that the
non-Gaussian tests used in this work represent a powerful tool to quantify the
robustness of Fisher matrix calculations and their underlying assumptions. We
release the code used to compute the power spectra, bispectra, and WST that can
be run on both CPUs and GPUs.

memory intensity due to their deep learning and massive embedding tables.
Training these models typically involve a hybrid CPU-GPU mode, where GPUs
accelerate the deep learning portion and the CPUs store and process the
memory-intensive embedding tables. The hybrid mode incurs a substantial
CPU-to-GPU transfer time and relies on main memory bandwidth to feed embeddings
to GPU for deep learning acceleration. Alternatively, we can store the entire
embeddings across GPUs to avoid the transfer time and utilize the GPU's High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM). This approach requires GPU-to-GPU backend communication
and scales the number of GPUs with the size of the embedding tables. To
overcome these concerns, this paper offers a heterogeneous acceleration
pipeline, called Hotline.
  Hotline leverages the insight that only a small number of embedding entries
are accessed frequently, and can easily fit in a single GPU's HBM. Hotline
implements a data-aware and model-aware scheduling pipeline that utilizes the
(1) CPU main memory for not-frequently-accessed embeddings and (2) GPUs' local
memory for frequently-accessed embeddings. Hotline improves the training
throughput by dynamically stitching the execution of popular and not-popular
inputs through a novel hardware accelerator and feeding to the GPUs. Results on
real-world datasets and recommender models show that Hotline reduces the
average training time by 3x and 1.8x in comparison to Intel-optimized CPU-GPU
DLRM and HugeCTR-optimized GPU-only baseline, respectively. Hotline increases
the overall training throughput to 35.7 epochs/hour in comparison to 5.3

predictions because prior work focuses on individual platforms such as Twitter;
however, any single platform is only a small, incomplete part of the larger

confirms that memes from core communities are more likely to diffuse than those

Therefore, this paper aims to propose different architectures and investigate

understanding nucleosynthesis of $A\geq 30$ nuclides in oxygen-neon novae. The
Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging was used to measure $^{31}$Cl
$\beta$-delayed proton decay through the key $J^{\pi}=3/2^{+}$, 260-keV
resonance. The intensity $I^{260}_{\beta p} = 8.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-6}$
represents the weakest $\beta$-delayed, charged-particle emission ever measured
below 400 keV, resulting in a proton branching ratio of $\Gamma_p / \Gamma =
2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-4}$. By combining this measurement with
shell-model calculations for $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ and past work on other
resonances, the total $^{30}$P$(p,\gamma)^{31}$S rate has been determined with
reduced uncertainty. The new rate has been used in hydrodynamic simulations to
model the composition of nova ejecta, leading to a concrete prediction of
$^{30}$Si/$^{28}$Si excesses in presolar nova grains and the calibration of
nuclear thermometers.

centroid based awareness component to enhance the system by equipping it with
additional spatial geometry information in the latent feature projection space.
We evaluate our model using the new MISP challenge 2021 dataset. Our model

missing modalities. Therefore multimodal models that are robust against

shown great success in processing multimodal data. However, existing work has
been limited to either architecture designs or pre-training strategies; whether
Transformer models are naturally robust against missing-modal data has rarely
been investigated. In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work to
comprehensively investigate the behavior of Transformers in the presence of

to missing modalities while different modal fusion strategies will
significantly affect the robustness. What surprised us is that the optimal
fusion strategy is dataset dependent even for the same Transformer model; there
does not exist a universal strategy that works in general cases. Based on these
findings, we propose a principle method to improve the robustness of
Transformer models by automatically searching for an optimal fusion strategy
regarding input data. Experimental validations on three benchmarks support the
superior performance of the proposed method.

consider the radiation from a macroscopic spin emitter, such as the collective
radiation from an atomic ensemble. We introduce a new class of macroscopic spin
states, the coherently radiating spin states (CRSS), defined as the asymptotic
eigenstates of the SU(2) lowering operator. We find that a spin emitter in a
CRSS radiates classical-like coherent light, although the CRSS itself is a
quantum entangled state exhibiting spin squeezing. We further show that CRSS
are naturally produced in Dicke superradiance and underlie the dissipative
Dicke phase transition. Our CRSS theory thus provides new concepts for studying
the quantum physics of radiation, with applications in current platforms

requiring human annotations. However, most existing methods, especially those
targeted on image classification, only work in a simplified scenario by
assuming all new data belong to new tasks, which is not realistic if the class
labels are not provided. Therefore, to perform unsupervised continual learning
in real life applications, an out-of-distribution detector is required at
beginning to identify whether each new data corresponds to a new task or
already learned tasks, which still remains under-explored yet. In this work, we
formulate the problem for Out-of-distribution Detection in Unsupervised
Continual Learning (OOD-UCL) with the corresponding evaluation protocol. In
addition, we propose a novel OOD detection method by correcting the output bias
at first and then enhancing the output confidence for in-distribution data
based on task discriminativeness, which can be applied directly without
modifying the learning procedures and objectives of continual learning. Our
method is evaluated on CIFAR-100 dataset by following the proposed evaluation
protocol and we show improved performance compared with existing OOD detection
methods under the unsupervised continual learning scenario.

dramatically with the number of agents as well as the size of their action
spaces, which is typical in real world scenarios such as autonomous vehicles,
robotic teams, network routing, etc. It is hence in imminent need to design
decentralized or independent algorithms where the update of each agent is only
based on their local observations without the need of introducing complex
communication/coordination mechanisms.
  In this work, we study the finite-time convergence of independent
entropy-regularized natural policy gradient (NPG) methods for potential games,
where the difference in an agent's utility function due to unilateral deviation
matches exactly that of a common potential function. The proposed
entropy-regularized NPG method enables each agent to deploy symmetric,
decentralized, and multiplicative updates according to its own payoff. We show
that the proposed method converges to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) --
the equilibrium to the entropy-regularized game -- at a sublinear rate, which
is independent of the size of the action space and grows at most sublinearly
with the number of agents. Appealingly, the convergence rate further becomes
independent with the number of agents for the important special case of
identical-interest games, leading to the first method that converges at a
dimension-free rate. Our approach can be used as a smoothing technique to find
an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE) of the unregularized problem without
assuming that stationary policies are isolated.

provide stronger authentication to users. In PKA, a user manages private keys
on her devices called authenticators, and services bind the corresponding
public keys to her account. To protect private keys, a user uses authenticators
which never export private keys outside. On the other hand, a user regularly
uses multiple authenticators like PCs and smartphones. She replaces some of her
authenticators according to their lifecycle, such as purchasing new devices and
losing devices. It is a burden for a user to register, update and revoke public
keys in many services every time she registers new accounts with services and
replaces some of her authenticators. To ease the burden, we propose a mechanism
where users and services manage public keys based on the owner of
authenticators and users can access services with PKA using any of their
authenticators. We introduce a key pair called an Ownership Verification Key
(OVK), which consists of the private key (OVSK) and the corresponding public
key (OVPK). All authenticators owned by a user derive the same OVSK from the
pre-shared secret called the seed. Services verify the ownership of the
authenticators using the corresponding OVPK to determine whether binding the
requested public key to her account. To protect user privacy while maintaining
convenience, authenticators generate a different OVK for each service from the
seed independently. We demonstrate the feasibility through the Proof of Concept
implementation, show that our proposed mechanism achieves some security goals,
and discuss how the mechanism mitigates threats not completely handled.

combing with accurate potential energy and dipole moment surfaces, our
implemented cavity vibrational self-consistent field/virtual state

quantitative predictions of the IR spectra when the molecule is inside or

blue/red shift of certain bands are found to be highly related with the

the simulated spectra shows that polaritonic strong vibrational coupling
greatly induce the coupling between molecule's vibrational modes, indicating
the intramolecular vibrational energy transfer may be significantly accelerated
by the cavity.

modified documents and the blocks can be merged and split, Sinkhorn divergence
is adopted in our graph neural approach, which tries to overcome both these

This method is applied to the globular cluster data obtained from the PIPER

that has no detected diffuse stellar content. Preliminary analysis shows that
it is unlikely to be merely an accidental clump of globular clusters or other
objects. If confirmed, this system would be the first of its kind. Simulations
are used to assess how the physical parameters of the globular cluster systems

quantify the correlation of the detection probability with the total number of

contains an arbitrary number of elements, the task of temporal sets prediction
aims to predict the elements in the subsequent set. Previous studies for
temporal sets prediction mainly capture each user's evolutionary preference by
learning from his/her own sequence. Although insightful, we argue that: 1) the
collaborative signals latent in different users' sequences are essential but
have not been exploited; 2) users also tend to show stationary preferences
while existing methods fail to consider. To this end, we propose an integrated
learning framework to model both the evolutionary and the stationary
preferences of users for temporal sets prediction, which first constructs a
universal sequence by chronologically arranging all the user-set interactions,
and then learns on each user-set interaction. In particular, for each user-set
interaction, we first design an evolutionary user preference modelling
component to track the user's time-evolving preference and exploit the latent
collaborative signals among different users. This component maintains a memory
bank to store memories of the related user and elements, and continuously
updates their memories based on the currently encoded messages and the past
memories. Then, we devise a stationary user preference modelling module to
discover each user's personalized characteristics according to the historical
sequence, which adaptively aggregates the previously interacted elements from
dual perspectives with the guidance of the user's and elements' embeddings.
Finally, we develop a set-batch algorithm to improve the model efficiency,
which can create time-consistent batches in advance and achieve 3.5x training
speedups on average. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and good interpretability of our approach.

can be characterized in the long-time limit by computing a scaled cumulant

robust numerical techniques to carry out this computation is needed to probe

Effective cancer type from high-dimensional genetic mutation data can be useful

Privacy concerns in outsourced ML, especially in the field of genetics,

But restrictive overheads of encrypted computation deter its usage. In this
work, we explore the challenges of privacy preserving cancer detection using a
real-world dataset consisting of more than 2 million genetic information for
several cancer types. Since the data is inherently high-dimensional, we explore
smaller ML models for cancer prediction to enable fast inference in the privacy
preserving domain. We develop a solution for privacy preserving cancer

feature selection. Our logistic regression model, built using our novel

lightweight neural network (i.e., student model) by transferring the knowledge
of a well-performed neural network (i.e., teacher model), which has been widely
applied in many computer vision tasks, including face recognition.
Nevertheless, the current face recognition distillation methods usually utilize
the Feature Consistency Distillation (FCD) (e.g., L2 distance) on the learned
embeddings extracted by the teacher and student models for each sample, which
is not able to fully transfer the knowledge from the teacher to the student for
face recognition. In this work, we observe that mutual relation knowledge
between samples is also important to improve the discriminative ability of the
learned representation of the student model, and propose an effective face
recognition distillation method called CoupleFace by additionally introducing
the Mutual Relation Distillation (MRD) into existing distillation framework.
Specifically, in MRD, we first propose to mine the informative mutual
relations, and then introduce the Relation-Aware Distillation (RAD) loss to
transfer the mutual relation knowledge of the teacher model to the student
model. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets

traditional algorithms by updating and transferring the image in pixel space,

elementary particles in Nature are dictated by gauge forces, characterized by a
nonintegrable phase factor that an elementary particle of charge $q$ acquires
from A to B points: $$P \exp\left(i\frac{q}{\hbar c} \int_A^B A_\mu

ordering. In a many-body system of strongly correlated electrons, if the
so-called Mott gap is opened up by interaction, the corresponding Hilbert space
will be fundamentally changed. A novel nonintegrable phase factor known as
phase-string will appear and replace the conventional Fermi statistics to
dictate the low-lying physics. Protected by the Mott gap, which is clearly
identified in the high-$T_c$ cuprate with a magnitude > 1.5 eV, such a singular
phase factor can enforce a fractionalization of the electrons, leading to a
dual world of exotic elementary particles with a topological gauge structure. A
non-Fermi-liquid ""parent"" state will emerge, in which the gapless Landau
quasiparticle is only partially robust around the so-called Fermi arc regions,
while the main dynamics are dominated by two types of gapped spinons.
Antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and a Fermi liquid with full Fermi
surface can be regarded as the low-temperature instabilities of this new parent
state. Both numerics and experiments provide direct evidence for such an
emergent physics of the Mottness, which lies in the core of a high-$T_c$
superconducting mechanism.

class of learning rules to update their strategies at a faster timescale, while
a social planner updates the incentive mechanism at a slower timescale. In
particular, the update of the incentive mechanism is based on each player's
externality, which is evaluated as the difference between the player's marginal

point of our learning dynamics corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism
such that the corresponding Nash equilibrium also achieves social optimality.
We also provide sufficient conditions for the learning dynamics to converge to
a fixed point so that the adaptive incentive mechanism eventually induces a
socially optimal outcome. Finally, we demonstrate that the sufficient

compact multiquark states. The latter are modeled as bare states in the Hilbert
space of a potential model. In this work, we study several potential models
relevant to the bare state, and solve their inverse scattering problems. The
first model, called ""cc"", is a separable potential model. We show that it can
approximate (single-channel short-range) $S$-wave near-threshold physics with
an error of $\mathcal{O}(\beta^3/M_V^3)$, where $\beta$ sets the maximum
momentum of the near-threshold region and $M_V$ is the typical scale of the
potential. The second model, called ""bc"", serves as the bare-state-dominance
approximation, where interaction between continuum states is ignored. Under
this model, even though the bare state is always crucial for a bound state's
generation, a shallow bound state naturally tends to have a small bare-state
proportion. Therefore, we need other quantities to quantify the importance of
the bare state. The last model, called ""bcc"", is a combination of the first two
models. This model not only serves as a correction to the bare-state-dominance
approximation, but can also be used to understand the interplay between quark
and hadron degrees of freedom. This model naturally leads to the presence of a
Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) zero. We consider the energy decomposition of a
bound state. The potential ratio of the bare-continuum interaction to the
continuum self-interaction is proposed to understand how the bound state is
generated. Model independently, an inequality for the potential ratio is
derived. Based on the model ""bcc"", the CDD zero can be used to estimate the
potential ratio. Finally, we apply these studies to the deuteron, $\rho$ meson,

using multiple evidential sentences from trustworthy corpora, e.g., Wikipedia.
Most existing approaches follow a three-step pipeline framework, including
document retrieval, sentence retrieval and claim verification. High-quality
evidences provided by the first two steps are the foundation of the effective
reasoning in the last step. Despite being important, high-quality evidences are
rarely studied by existing works for FV, which often adopt the off-the-shelf
models to retrieve relevant documents and sentences in an
""index-retrieve-then-rank"" fashion. This classical approach has clear drawbacks
as follows: i) a large document index as well as a complicated search process
is required, leading to considerable memory and computational overhead; ii)
independent scoring paradigms fail to capture the interactions among documents
and sentences in ranking; iii) a fixed number of sentences are selected to form
the final evidence set. In this work, we propose GERE, the first system that
retrieves evidences in a generative fashion, i.e., generating the document
titles as well as evidence sentence identifiers. This enables us to mitigate
the aforementioned technical issues since: i) the memory and computational cost
is greatly reduced because the document index is eliminated and the heavy
ranking process is replaced by a light generative process; ii) the dependency
between documents and that between sentences could be captured via sequential
generation process; iii) the generative formulation allows us to dynamically
select a precise set of relevant evidences for each claim. The experimental
results on the FEVER dataset show that GERE achieves significant improvements
over the state-of-the-art baselines, with both time-efficiency and
memory-efficiency.

Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations show, that a significantly higher bulk

cyclotron frequency equals half of the applied RF frequency for a given fixed

quantum architecture and is actively pursued based on various physical
platforms. However, demonstrating a transducer with positive quantum capacity
is still practically challenging. In this work, we discuss a new approach to
relax the impedance matching condition to half impedance matching condition,
which is achieved by introducing two-photon drive in the electro-optic
transducer. We show the quantum transduction capacity can be enhanced and can
be understood in a simple interference picture with the help of Bloch-Messiah
decomposition. The parameter regimes with positive quantum capacity is
identified and compared with and without the drive, indicating that the
parametric drive-induced enhancement is really promising in demonstrating
quantum state conversion, and is expected to boost the performance of
transduction with various physical platforms.

issue of BiRNN, we present a novel recurrent network consisting of forward and

look-ahead module is an elaborate forward module for leveraging information

by forward and look-ahead recurrent modules are combined, thereby making it
feasible to exploit both historical and near-future frames. Due to the scene
motion between non-neighboring frames, border pixels missing may occur when
warping look-ahead feature from near-future frame to current frame, which can
be largely alleviated by incorporating forward warping and proposed border

As such, maximizing the light collection efficiency of the detector is vital to
performance. Since Cherenkov emission is heavily weighted towards the near UV,
one method to maximize overall detector light collection without increasing the
number of photomultiplier tubes is to couple each tube to a wavelength-shifting
plastic plate, thus shifting photon wavelengths to a regime better suited to
maximize photomultiplier efficiency and potentially detecting photons that miss
the photocathode. To better understand the behavior of such plates, a scan of a
rectangular wavelength-shifting plate was performed, and the results were used

be expected for individual PMTs in a large water-Cherenkov detector.
Measurements of a 15.1 in. by 11.5 in. wavelength-shifting plate using a 365 nm

by $7.4\pm0.7\%$. A simulation tuned to reproduce these results was used to
predict the behavior of a wavelength shifting plate exposed to Cherenkov

the classification performance. In this paper, a Character-Context Decoupling
framework is proposed to alleviate this problem by separating contextual

decomposed into temporal information and linguistic information. Here, temporal
information that models character order and word length is isolated with a
detached temporal attention module. Linguistic information that models n-gram

synthetic data produced with TrueType fonts has been often used in the training

there is a significant style bias between synthetic and real data which hinders
the improvement of recognition performance. To deal with such limitations, we
propose a generative method for handwritten text-line images, which is

to produce long text-line samples with diverse handwriting styles. Once

necessary for training statistical and machine learning tools and models.
Causes of resource scarcity vary but can include poor access to technology for
developing these resources, a relatively small population of speakers, or a
lack of urgency for collecting such resources in bilingual populations where
the second language is high-resource. As a result, the languages described as
low-resource in the literature are as different as Finnish on the one hand,
with millions of speakers using it in every imaginable domain, and Seneca, with
only a small-handful of fluent speakers using the language primarily in a
restricted domain. While issues stemming from the lack of resources necessary
to train models unite this disparate group of languages, many other issues cut
across the divide between widely-spoken low resource languages and endangered
languages. In this position paper, we discuss the unique technological,
cultural, practical, and ethical challenges that researchers and indigenous
speech community members face when working together to develop language
technology to support endangered language documentation and revitalization. We
report the perspectives of language teachers, Master Speakers and elders from
indigenous communities, as well as the point of view of academics. We describe
an ongoing fruitful collaboration and make recommendations for future

Recognition (NER) from proposing new frameworks or incorporating word lexicons.
However, the inner composition of entity mentions in character-level Chinese
NER has been rarely studied. Actually, most mentions of regular types have
strong name regularity. For example, entities end with indicator words such as
""company"" or ""bank"" usually belong to organization. In this paper, we propose a
simple but effective method for investigating the regularity of entity spans in
Chinese NER, dubbed as Regularity-Inspired reCOgnition Network (RICON).
Specifically, the proposed model consists of two branches: a regularity-aware
module and a regularityagnostic module. The regularity-aware module captures
the internal regularity of each span for better entity type prediction, while
the regularity-agnostic module is employed to locate the boundary of entities
and relieve the excessive attention to span regularity. An orthogonality space
is further constructed to encourage two modules to extract different aspects of
regularity features. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and a practical medical
dataset. The experimental results show that our RICON significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods, including various lexicon-based methods.

in-depth analysis and show that the damage of label shift can be overcome by
aligning the data conditional distribution and correcting the posterior

remolding the classifier predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on the

designed schemes impact the learned results significantly. Yet, in KD,
automatically searching an optimal distillation scheme has not yet been well
explored. In this paper, we propose DistPro, a novel framework which searches
for an optimal KD process via differentiable meta-learning. Specifically, given
a pair of student and teacher networks, DistPro first sets up a rich set of KD
connection from the transmitting layers of the teacher to the receiving layers
of the student, and in the meanwhile, various transforms are also proposed for
comparing feature maps along its pathway for the distillation. Then, each
combination of a connection and a transform choice (pathway) is associated with
a stochastic weighting process which indicates its importance at every step
during the distillation. In the searching stage, the process can be effectively
learned through our proposed bi-level meta-optimization strategy. In the
distillation stage, DistPro adopts the learned processes for knowledge
distillation, which significantly improves the student accuracy especially when
faster training is required. Lastly, we find the learned processes can be
generalized between similar tasks and networks. In our experiments, DistPro
produces state-of-the-art (SoTA) accuracy under varying number of learning

independent set reconfiguration problem asks whether there exists a sequence of
$k$-sized independent sets $I_s = I_0, I_1, I_2, \ldots, I_\ell = I_t$ such
that each independent set is obtained from the previous one using a so-called
reconfiguration step. Viewing each independent set as a collection of $k$
tokens placed on the vertices of a graph $G$, the two most studied
reconfiguration steps are token jumping and token sliding. In the token jumping
variant of the problem, a single step allows a token to jump from one vertex to
any other vertex in the graph. In the token sliding variant, a token is only
allowed to slide from a vertex to one of its neighbors. Like the independent
set problem, both of the aforementioned problems are known to be W[1]-hard on
general graphs. A very fruitful line of research has showed that the
independent set problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable when restricted to
sparse graph classes, such as planar, bounded treewidth, nowhere-dense, and all
the way to biclique-free graphs. Over a series of papers, the same was shown to
hold for the token jumping problem. As for the token sliding problem, which is
mentioned in most of these papers, almost nothing is known beyond the fact that
the problem is polynomial-time solvable on trees and interval graphs. We remedy
this situation by introducing a new model for the reconfiguration of
independent sets, which we call galactic reconfiguration. Using this new model,
we show that (standard) token sliding is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of
bounded degree, planar graphs, and chordal graphs of bounded clique number. We
believe that the galactic reconfiguration model is of independent interest and
could potentially help in resolving the remaining open questions concerning the
(parameterized) complexity of token sliding.

finger normal force to skin indentation at the wrist, and shear force to skin
shear at the wrist, would result in better perception than other mappings that
either mixed or merged the two direction into a single type of feedback. We
performed an experiment where haptic devices at the wrist rendered either
normal or shear feedback during manipulation of virtual objects with varying
stiffness, mass, or friction properties. Perception of mechanical properties
was more accurate with congruent skin stimulation than noncongruent. In
addition, discrimination performance and subjective reports were positively

consistent mapping between haptic feedback and interaction forces at the

We show that under mild assumptions, including stabilizability, detectability,

between $\kappa$-distributed control and centralized optimal control becomes
exponentially small in $\kappa$. This result reveals that distributed control
can achieve near-optimal performance with a moderate degree of

increases, the optimized FS price rises gradually until reaching the maximum
value, and profitability to the OEM increases overall; if frequency of induced

with a stable profitability to the OEM.

low-spectral resolution grism data when only upper-limits on $\mathrm{H}\beta$

($R_V=3.26$) lie in-between the values found for $z=0$ and $z\sim2$ dust
attenuation curves derived with similar methods. These provide supporting
evidence that the average dust attenuation curve of star forming galaxies
evolves continuously with redshift. The $z\sim1.3$ curve has a mild 2175\r{A}
feature (bump amplitude, $E_b=0.83$; $\sim$25% that of the MW extinction

(OPF) problem becomes a computational challenge for large-scale, realistic AC
networks. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a novel network
reduction methodology that leverages an efficient mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) formulation of a Kron-based reduction that is optimal in the
sense that it balances the degree of the reduction with resulting modeling
errors in the reduced network. The method takes as inputs the full AC network
and a pre-computed library of AC load flow data and uses the graph Laplacian to
constraint nodal reductions to only be feasible for neighbors of non-reduced
nodes. This results in a highly effective MILP formulation which is embedded
within an iterative scheme to successively improve the Kron-based network
reduction until convergence. The resulting optimal network reduction is, thus,
grounded in the physics of the full network. The accuracy of the network
reduction methodology is then explored for a 100+ node medium-voltage radial
distribution feeder example across a wide range of operating conditions. It is
finally shown that a network reduction of 25-85% can be achieved within seconds

not so popular in deep learning. Most previous low-rank network compression
methods compress the networks by approximating pre-trained models and
re-training. However, the optimal solution in the Euclidean space may be quite
different from the one in the low-rank manifold. A well-pre-trained model is
not a good initialization for the model with low-rank constraints. Thus, the
performance of a low-rank compressed network degrades significantly. Compared
to other network compression methods such as pruning, low-rank methods attracts
less attention in recent years. In this paper, we devise a new training method,
low-rank projection with energy transfer (LRPET), that trains low-rank
compressed networks from scratch and achieves competitive performance. First,
we propose to alternately perform stochastic gradient descent training and
projection onto the low-rank manifold. Compared to re-training on the compact
model, this enables full utilization of model capacity since solution space is
relaxed back to Euclidean space after projection. Second, the matrix energy
(the sum of squares of singular values) reduction caused by projection is
compensated by energy transfer. We uniformly transfer the energy of the pruned
singular values to the remaining ones. We theoretically show that energy
transfer eases the trend of gradient vanishing caused by projection. Third, we
propose batch normalization (BN) rectification to cut off its effect on the
optimal low-rank approximation of the weight matrix, which further improves the
performance. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have justified
that our method is superior to other low-rank compression methods and also
outperforms recent state-of-the-art pruning methods. Our code is available at

in the vacuum is a structure of anti-quarks $\bar{q}$ and quarks $q$. The
$\bar{q}$ and $q$ pair has the same quantum number as the vacuum and
condensates in it since the strong interaction of the quantum chromodynamics
(QCD) is too strong to leave it empty. The $\bar{q}q$ condensation breaks the
chiral symmetry of the vacuum. The expectation value $<\bar{q}q>$ is an order
parameter. For higher temperature or higher matter-density, $|<\bar{q}q>|$
decreases reflecting the restoration of the symmetry. In contrast to these
clear-cut arguments, experimental evidence is so far limited. First of all, the
$\bar{q}q$ is nothing but the vacuum itself. It is neither visible nor
perceptible. In this article, we unravel this invisible existence by high
precision measurement of pionic atoms, $\pi^-$-meson-nucleus bound systems.
Using the $\pi^-$ as a probe, we demonstrate that $|<\bar{q}q>|$ is reduced in
the nucleus by a factor of 58 $\pm$ 4% compared with that in the vacuum. This
reduction indicates that the chiral symmetry is partially restored due to the
extremely high density of the nucleus. The present experimental result clearly
exhibits the existence of the hidden structure, the chiral condensate, in the
vacuum.

autoencoder for learning low-dimensional system representation and a long

the dimension-reduction of complex wave propagation phenomena via
projection-based methods as it can directly learn subspaces resembling wave

to the Fourier subspace. Geometric priors of the convolutional autoencoder
enabling selective scale separation of complex wave dynamics further enhance
its dimension-reduction capability. We also demonstrate that geometric priors

convolutional autoencoder enable generalized learning of low-dimensional maps.
Thus, the composite CRAN model connecting the convolutional autoencoder with a

Opponent Model} (TDOM) to encode the knowledge that the opponent policies tend
to improve over time. We motivate TDOM theoretically by deriving a lower bound
of the log objective of an individual agent and further propose
\textit{Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with Time Dynamical Opponent Model} (TDOM-AC).
We evaluate the proposed TDOM-AC on a differential game and the Multi-agent
Particle Environment. We show empirically that TDOM achieves superior opponent
behavior prediction during test time. The proposed TDOM-AC methodology
outperforms state-of-the-art Actor-Critic methods on the performed experiments
in cooperative and \textbf{especially} in mixed cooperative-competitive
environments. TDOM-AC results in a more stable training and a faster
convergence.

of the nonlinearity parameter $\chi$ scales as ""super-Heisenberg scaling""
$1/N^2$ with $N$ being the total average number of particles (photons) due to
the nonlinear generator. Here, we find that ""super-Heisenberg scaling""
$1/N^{3/2}$ can also be obtained by choosing a proper interrogation time. In
the steady state, the ""super-Heisenberg scaling"" $1/N^{3/2}$ can only be
achieved when the nonlinearity parameter is close to 0 in the case of the
single-photon loss and the one-photon driving or the two-photon driving. The
""super-Heisenberg scaling"" disappears with the increase of the strength of the
nonlinearity. When the system suffers from the two-photon loss in addition to
the single-photon loss, the optimal measurement precision will not appear at
the nonlinearity $\chi=0$ in the case of the one-photon driving.
Counterintuitively, in the case of the two-photon driving we find that it is
not the case that the higher the two-photon loss, the lower the measurement
precision. It means that the measurement precision of $\chi$ can be improved to
some extent by increasing the two-photon loss.

newer codecs such as HEVC, AV1, and VVC, and intelligent encoding strategies,
as well as improved bandwidth availability,there has been a proliferation and
acceptance of newer services such as Netflix, Twitch, etc. However, such higher
compression efficiencies are achieved at the cost of higher complexity and
encoding delay, while many applications are delay sensitive. Hence, there is a
requirement for faster, more efficient codecs to achieve higher encoding
efficiency without significant trade-off in terms of both complexity and speed.
We present in this work an evaluation of the latest MPEG-5 Part 2 Low
Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) for live gaming video streaming
applications. The results are presented in terms of bitrate savings using both
subjective and objective quality measures as well as a comparison of the
encoding speeds. Our results indicate that, for the encoding settings used in
this work, LCEVC outperforms both x264 and x265 codecs in terms of bitrate
savings using VMAF by approximately 42\% and 38\%. Using subjective results, it
is found that LCEVC outperforms the respective base codecs, especially for low
bitrates. This effect is more evident for x264 than for x265, i.e., for the
latter the absolute improvement of quality scores is smaller. The objective and

which prolate/oblate cores form. We find that an initially sub-critical
filament experiencing relatively low pressure ($\lesssim 10^{4}$ K cm$^{-3}$)
forms prolate cores (i.e., those with axial ratios in excess of unity) via
gradual accumulation of gas in density crests. Meanwhile, a filament that is
initially transcritical and experiences pressure similar to that in the Solar
neighbourhood (between $\mathrm{few}\ \times 10^{4}$ K cm$^{-3}$ -
$\mathrm{few}\ \times 10^{5}$ K cm$^{-3}$) forms oblate cores (i.e., those with
axial ratios less than unity) via \emph{Jeans like} fragmentation. At higher
pressure, however, fragments within the filament do not tend to survive as they
rebound soon after formation. We also argue that quasi-oscillatory features of
velocity gradient observed along the filament axis, and in the direction
orthogonal to the axis, are integral to the filament evolution process and
arise due to the growth of corrugations on its surface. The axial component of
the velocity gradient, in particular, traces the gas-flow along the filament
length. We therefore posit that it could be used to constrain the
filament-formation mechanism. The magnitude of the respective components of
velocity gradients increases with increasing external pressure.

and Normalized Squares Maximization (NSM), are proposed to maximize both
predictive discriminability and equity, from the class level and the sample
level, respectively. Importantly, we theoretically relate these two novel
losses (i.e., CWSM and NSM) to the equity maximization under mild conditions,
and empirically suggest the importance of the predictive equity in UDA.
Moreover, it is very efficient to realize the equity constraints in both
losses. Experiments of cross-domain image classification on three popular
benchmark datasets show that both CWSM and NSM contribute to outperforming the
corresponding counterparts.

simultaneously learns scene-agnostic embeddings and scene-specific knowledge
through scene-conditioned hypernetworks. More specifically, our HyperDet3D not

the detector to the given scene at test time. We propose a discriminative
Multi-head Scene-specific Attention (MSA) module to dynamically control the
layer parameters of the detector conditioned on the fusion of scene-conditioned

spatio-temporal resolution multi-angle imaging observations taken by the Solar

the observation of a broad quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) wave train
composed of multiple wavefronts along the solar surface during the rising phase
of a GOES M3.5 flare on 2011 February 24. The wave train transmitted through a
lunate coronal hole (CH) with a speed of 840 +/-67 km/s, and the wavefronts
showed an intriguing refraction effect when they passed through the boundaries
of the CH. Due to the lunate shape of the CH, the transmitted wavefronts from
the north and south arms of the CH started to approach each other and finally
collided, leading to the significant intensity enhancement at the collision
site. This enhancement might hint the occurrence of interference between the
two transmitted wave trains. The estimated magnetosonic Mach number of the wave
train is about 1.13, which indicates that the observed wave train was a weak
shock. Period analysis reveals that the period of wave train was $\sim$90
seconds, in good agreement with that of the accompanying flare. Based on our

estimation. These approaches can be subdivided into regression and
classification methods. The latter assign PPG signals to predefined BP
intervals that represent clinically relevant ranges. The former predict
systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP as continuous variables and are of
particular interest to the research community. However, the reported accuracies
of BP regression methods vary widely among publications with some authors even
questioning the feasibility of PPG-based BP regression altogether. In our work,
we compare BP regression and classification approaches. We argue that BP
classification might provide diagnostic value that is equivalent to regression
in many clinically relevant scenarios while being similar or even superior in
terms of performance. We compare several established neural architectures using
publicly available PPG data for SBP regression and classification with and
without personalization using subject-specific data. We found that
classification and regression models perform similar before personalization.
However, after personalization, the accuracy of classification based methods
outperformed regression approaches. We conclude that BP classification might be
preferable over BP regression in certain scenarios where a coarser segmentation
of the BP range is sufficient.

as a normal binary-lens single-source (2L1S) event, but a careful 2L1S
modelling showed that it needs an additional lens or source to fit the observed
data. It is found that the 3L1S model provides the best fit, but the
binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model is only disfavoured by $\Delta\chi^2

mass-ratios $10^{-3} \lesssim q \lesssim 10^{-2}$. A Bayesian analysis based on
a Galactic model indicates that the planet is super-Jovian, and the projected
host-planet separation is about 3 $\mathrm{au}$. Specifically, for the best-fit
3L1S model, the two stars have masses of $M_1=0.57^{+0.43}_{-0.32}M_{\odot}$,
and $M_2=0.18^{+0.15}_{-0.10}M_{\odot}$, with projected separation of
$1.3^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ $\mathrm{au}$, and the planetary mass is
$M_3=2.2^{+1.8}_{-1.3}M_{\rm{Jupiter}}$. For the 2L2S model, the masses of the

$4.6^{+3.7}_{-2.6}M_{\rm{Jupiter}}$, respectively. By investigating the
properties of all known microlensing planets in binary systems, we find that
all planets in binary systems published by the KMTNet survey are located inside
the resonant caustics range with $q \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{-3}$, indicating the
incompleteness of the KMTNet sample for planets in binary systems. Thus,
planets in binary systems cannot be included in the current study of the KMTNet

domain estimators for $d$ but there are only a few estimators in the time
domain. Moreover, the latter estimators are criticized for relying on visual
inspection to determine an observation window $[n_1, n_2]$ for a linear
regression to run on. Theoretically motivated choices of $n_1$ and $n_2$ are
often missing for many time series models.
  In this paper, we take the well-known variance plot estimator and provide
rigorous asymptotic conditions on $[n_1, n_2]$ to ensure the estimator's
consistency under LRD. We establish these conditions for a large class of
square-integrable time series models. This large class enables one to use the
variance plot estimator to detect LRD for infinite-variance time series (after
suitable transformation). Thus, detection of LRD for infinite-variance time
series is another novelty of our paper. A simulation study indicates that the
variance plot estimator can detect LRD better than the popular spectral domain
GPH estimator.

not a proper estimator of the true covariance matrix since it is not invertible
when we have fewer observations than the data dimension. Even with more
observations, the sample covariance matrix may not be well-conditioned. This
paper determines the GMVP weights based on a regularized covariance matrix
estimator to overcome the aforementioned difficulties. Unlike other methods,
the proper selection of the regularization parameter is achieved by minimizing
the mean-squared error of an estimate of the noise vector that accounts for the
uncertainty in the data mean estimation. Using random-matrix-theory tools, we
derive a consistent estimator of the achievable mean-squared error that allows

These five sources are known to exhibit close association between radio

J1000+1242, J1356+1026 and J1430+1339) show polarization in the current data.
J1010+1413 is the unpolarized source in our sample. We detect $0.5-1\%$
fractional polarization in the radio cores and a high fractional polarization
($10-30\%$) in the lobes of these sources. The morphological, spectral and
polarization properties suggest a jet origin for radio emission in J0945+1737,
J1000+1242, J1010+1413 and J1430+1339 whereas the current data cannot fully

anti-correlation between various polarized knots in the radio and [O III]

likely to be depolarized by the emission-line gas. By modeling the
depolarization effects, we estimate the size of the emission-line gas clouds to
be $\sim(2.8\pm1.7)\times10^{-5}$ parsec and the amount of thermal material

a fractional power {\delta}, which quantifies the degree of discounting of the
historical information in making inference with the current data. When {\delta}
is not pre-specified and is treated as random, it can be estimated from the
data using Bayesian updating paradigm. However, in the original form of the
joint power prior Bayesian approach, certain positive constants before the
likelihood of the historical data could be multiplied when different settings
of sufficient statistics are employed. This would change the power priors with
different constants, and hence the likelihood principle is violated. In this
article, we investigate a normalized power prior approach which obeys the
likelihood principle and is a modified form of the joint power prior. The
optimality properties of the normalized power prior in the sense of minimizing
the weighted Kullback-Leibler divergence is investigated. By examining the
posteriors of several commonly used distributions, we show that the discrepancy
between the historical and the current data can be well quantified by the power
parameter under the normalized power prior setting. Efficient algorithms to
compute the scale factor is also proposed. In addition, we illustrate the use

It is widely understood that offline RL is able to extract good policies even
from highly suboptimal data, a scenario where imitation learning finds
suboptimal solutions that do not improve over the demonstrator that generated
the dataset. However, another common use case for practitioners is to learn
from data that resembles demonstrations. In this case, one can choose to apply
offline RL, but can also use behavioral cloning (BC) algorithms, which mimic a
subset of the dataset via supervised learning. Therefore, it seems natural to
ask: when can an offline RL method outperform BC with an equal amount of expert
data, even when BC is a natural choice? To answer this question, we
characterize the properties of environments that allow offline RL methods to
perform better than BC methods, even when only provided with expert data.
Additionally, we show that policies trained on sufficiently noisy suboptimal
data can attain better performance than even BC algorithms with expert data,
especially on long-horizon problems. We validate our theoretical results via
extensive experiments on both diagnostic and high-dimensional domains including
robotic manipulation, maze navigation, and Atari games, with a variety of data
distributions. We observe that, under specific but common conditions such as
sparse rewards or noisy data sources, modern offline RL methods can
significantly outperform BC.

consistent; and (iii) that aesthetic tastes are subjective and, therefore,
there are considerable individual differences in aesthetic preferences.
Following a review of the scientific basis for these premises, we describe the
concept of the aesthetic evaluation-based authentication (AEbA) method and
illustrate an implementation of it. We address AEbA's advantages and
disadvantages relative to other related methods and conclude that it is
adequate for low-to-medium security domains. It cannot serve as a compulsory

the degree of aesthetic sensitivity required to use the system effectively. On
the plus side, the method offers a positive experience. It alleviates the

usability-oriented schemes provides better security in terms of
shoulder-surfing, phishing, and password space. Finally, we report on a pilot

  English Idioms with Word2Vec for non-native learners",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The aim of idiomify is to build a collocation-supplemented reverse dictionary
of idioms for the non-native learners of English. We aim to do so because the
reverse dictionary could help the non-natives explore idioms on demand, and the
collocations could also guide them on using idioms more adequately. The
cornerstone of the project is a reliable way of mining idioms from corpora,
which is however a challenge because idioms extensively vary in forms. We
tackle this by automatically deriving matching rules from their base forms. We
use Point-wise Mutual Inclusion (PMI), Term Frequency - Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF) to model collocations, since both of them are popular metric
for pairwise significance. We also try Term Frequency (TF) as the baseline
model. As for implementing the reverse-dictionary, three approaches could be
taken: inverted index, graphs and distributional semantics. We choose to take
the last approach and implement the reverse dictionary with Word2Vec, because
it is the most flexible approach of all and Word2Vec is a simple yet strong
baseline. Evaluating the methods has revealed rooms for improvement. We learn
that we can better identify idioms with the help of slop, wildcard and
reordering techniques. We also learn that we can get the best of both PMI and
TF-IDF if we use machine learning to find the sweet spot. Lastly, We learn that
Idiomify could be further improved with a mixture of inverted index and
distributional semantics approach. The limits aside, the proposed methods are
feasible, and their benefits to the non-natives are apparent, which therefore
can be used to aid the non-natives in acquiring English idioms.

the velocity gradients in the C$^{18}$O emission in the protostellar envelopes

field orientations in the dense cores at a 4,000 au scale, and there is also no
correlation between the velocity gradients and the angular dispersions of the
magnetic fields. However, a significant dependence on the misalignment angles
emerges after we normalize the rotational motion by the infalling motion, where
the ratios increase from $\lesssim1$ to $\gtrsim1$ with increasing misalignment
angles. This suggests that the misalignment could prompt angular momentum
transportation to the envelope scale but is not a dominant factor in
determining the envelope rotation, and other parameters, like mass accretion in
protostellar sources, also play an important role. These results remain valid
after taking into account projection effects. The comparison between our
estimated angular momentum in the protostellar envelopes and the sizes of the
known protostellar disks suggests that significant angular momentum is likely
lost between radii of $\sim$1,000-100 au in protostellar envelopes.

Even though many algorithms exist, state-of-the-art is implementing it directly

syntax representation, which we call free scoped monads. This approach
capitalizes on the ideas of free monads and Swierstra's data types \`a la

Bird and Patterson's de Bruijn notation as nested data types. These
constructions allow us to handle scopes in a language-agnostic way and provide

exhibits a maximum just before the collision between the two interfaces, which
is followed by a minimum. The peak of the roughness can be dominated by

modeling of quantum gases in trapping potentials. It consists in treating the
gas as an assembly of independent mesoscopic fluid cells at equilibrium with a
local chemical potential, and it is justified when the correlation length is
larger than the size of the cells. The LDA is often regarded as a crude
approximation, particularly in the ground state of the one-dimensional (1D)
Bose gas, { where the correlation length is ""therefore said to be"" infinite (in
the sense that correlation functions decay as a power law).} Here we take
another look at the LDA. The local density $\rho(x)$ is viewed as a functional
of the trapping potential $V(x)$, to which one applies a gradient expansion.
The zeroth order in that expansion is the LDA. The first-order correction in
the gradient expansion vanishes due to reflection symmetry. At second order,
there are two corrections proportional to $d^2V/dx^2$ and $(dV/dx)^2$, and we
propose a method to determine the corresponding coefficients by a perturbative
calculation in the Lieb-Liniger model. This leads to an expression for the
coefficients in terms of matrix elements of the density operator, which can in
principle be evaluated numerically for an arbitrary coupling constant; here we
show how to efficiently evaluate the coefficient associated to the curvature of
the potential $d^2V/dx^2$, which dominates the deviation to LDA near local
minima or maxima of the trapping potential. Both coefficients are evaluated
analytically in the limits of infinite repulsion (hard-core bosons) and small
repulsion (quasi-condensate).} The corrected LDA density profiles are compared
to DMRG calculations, with significant improvement compared to zeroth-order

discrete messages to reduce the message size since gradients cannot flow
through a discrete communication channel. Previous work proposed methods to
deal with this problem. However, these methods are tested in different

loss. As the majority of efficient driving lines are metallic, the amount of
wind driving and mass loss is dependent on the stellar metallicity Z. In
addition, line-driven winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous and clumpy.
However, to date, neither theoretical nor empirical studies of line-driven
winds have investigated how such wind clumping may also depend on Z. We
theoretically investigated the degree of wind clumping due to the
line-deshadowing instability (LDI) as a function of Z. We performed
two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the LDI with an assumed
one-dimensional radiation line force for a grid of O-star wind models with
fixed luminosity, but with different metal contents by varying the accumulative
line strength Qbar describing the total ensemble of driving lines. We find
that, for this fixed luminosity, the amount of wind clumping decreases with
metallicity. The decrease is clearly seen in the statistical properties of our
simulations, but is nonetheless rather weak; a simple power-law fit for the
dependence of the clumping factor f_cl = <rho^2>/<rho>^2 on metallicity yields
f_cl ~ Z^(0.15 +/- 0.01). This implies that empirically derived power-law
dependencies of mass-loss rate Mdot on metallicity -- which were previously
inferred from spectral diagnostics effectively depending on Mdot*sqrt(f_cl) but
without having any constraints on f_cl(Z) -- should be only modestly altered by
clumping. We expect that this prediction can be directly tested using new data
from the Hubble Space Telescope Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as

MOND using the phase space analysis. Unlike its precedent theory, namely TeVeS,
this theory is claimed to agree with the observed Cosmic Microwave Background
and matter power spectra. We convert the background cosmological equations of
the theory to a set of first-order autonomous equations. Then we explore the
corresponding critical points and their physical meaning. This method is
powerful in the sense that the cosmological behavior of the model is diagnosed
independently of the magnitude of the free parameters of the theory. We show
that the theory has a viable sequence of cosmological epochs. Although using
specific initial conditions, this theory mimics the standard cosmological
model; it provides a richer structure as far as the background cosmology is
concerned. This implies that further investigations are required to see if this
theory contributes to addressing the current cosmological tensions.

prompted research that reveals a number of biases in the language models

investigate to what extent transformer-based language models allow for
extracting knowledge about object relations (X occurs in Y; X consists of Z;
action A involves using X). To this end, we compare contextualized models with
their static counterparts. We make this comparison dependent on the application
of a number of similarity measures and classifiers. Our results are threefold:
Firstly, we show that the models combined with the different similarity
measures differ greatly in terms of the amount of knowledge they allow for
extracting. Secondly, our results suggest that similarity measures perform much
worse than classifier-based approaches. Thirdly, we show that, surprisingly,
static models perform almost as well as contextualized models -- in some cases
even better.

propagation in brittle materials has been a vector of technological
development. Nowadays, a broad range of applications relies on crack
propagation control, from the mitigation of damages, e.g., from impacts in
glass screens or windshields, to industrial processes harnessing fracture to
achieve clean cuts over large distances. Yet, studying the fracture in real
time is a challenging task, since cracks can propagate up to a few km/s in
materials that are often opaque. Here, we report on the in situ investigation
of cracks propagating at up to 2.5 km/s along a (001) plane of a silicon single
crystal, using X-ray diffraction megahertz imaging with intense and
time-structured synchrotron radiation. The studied system is based on the Smart
Cut process, where a buried layer in a material (typically Si) is weakened by
micro-cracks and then used to drive a macroscopic crack (0.1 m) in a plane
parallel to the surface with minimal deviation (1 nm). The results we report
here provide the first direct confirmation that the shape of the crack front is
not affected by the distribution of the micro-cracks, which had been a
postulate for previous studies based on post-fracture results. We further
measured instantaneous crack velocities over the centimeter-wide field-of-view,
which had only been previously inferred from sparse point measurements, and
evidence the effect of local heating by the X-ray beam. Finally, we also
observed the post-crack movements of the separated wafer parts, which can be
explained using pneumatics and elasticity. Thus, this study provides a
comprehensive view of controlled fracture propagation in a crystalline
material, paving the way for the in situ measurement of ultra-fast strain field
propagation.

these is a hypothetical non-luminous form of matter - dark matter. Models with
an extended scalar electroweak sector yield plausible dark matter candidates.
In this paper we study a specific model, C-III-a, from a family of
$S_3$-symmetric three-Higgs-doublet models. The model consists of two active
SU(2) doublets and an inert one. The latter is inert due to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry that survives the breaking of $S_3$, and would accommodate a dark
matter particle. We explore the model numerically, based on theoretical and
experimental constraints. After applying a number of successive checks over the
parameter space we found a viable dark matter mass region in the range
$[6.5;\,44.5]~\text{GeV}$. This region is drastically different from the
Higgs-like dark matter states that have been proposed: the well-known Inert
Doublet Model and models with three scalar doublets, with one or two inert
doublets. Furthermore, the C-III-a model allows for spontaneous CP violation.

generic super-resolution techniques have been studied to restore low-resolution
images for biometrics, the results obtained are not always as desired. Those
generic methods are usually aimed to enhance the visual appearance of the
scene. However, producing an overall visual enhancement of biometric images
does not necessarily correlate with a better recognition performance. Such
techniques are designed to restore generic images and therefore do not exploit
the specific structure found in biometric images (e.g. iris or faces), which
causes the solution to be sub-optimal. For this reason, super-resolution
techniques have to be adapted for the particularities of images from a specific

the application of super-resolution to different biometric modalities, such as
face iris, gait or fingerprint. This chapter presents an overview of recent

  ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model","11+ pages, 11 figures and 2 tables",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An extensive investigation, both numerical and analytical, is performed for
an anisotropic extension of the ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model. The
ground state phase diagram accommodates three symmetry-protected trivial
phases, three coexisting fractal phases and six Luttinger liquid phases. A
novel universality class arises from an instability of a Luttinger liquid
towards an exotic quantum state of matter with highly degenerate ground states.
The latter in turn is a coexisting fractal phase, which may be attributed to
the coexistence of ${\rm SU}(2)$ symmetry spontaneous breaking with one type-B
Goldstone mode on the characteristic line: $J_y=J_z$ and its cyclic
permutations with respect to $x$, $y$ and $z$, and ${\rm U}(1)$ spontaneous
symmetry breaking without any gapless Goldstone mode away from the
characteristic lines.

identification of this cluster, deep images were obtained with the 1.5-m
Russian-Turkish telescope RTT-150. Together with the open archival data of the
Hubble Space Telescope, it became possible to identify candidates for
gravitationally lensed images of distant blue galaxies in the form of arcs and
arclets. The observed giant arc near the brightest cluster galaxies allowed us
to estimate the radius of the Einstein ring, which is $ 9.8 \pm 1.3 $
arcseconds. The photometric redshift of the lensed source was obtained ($ z_s =
2.44 \pm 0.07 $). Its use in combination with the Einstein radius estimate made
it possible to independently estimate the \cl2305 mass. It was done by
extrapolating the strong lensing results to large radii and using the model
density distribution profiles in relaxed clusters. This extrapolation leads to
mass estimates $ \sim 1.5-3 $ times smaller than those obtained from X-ray and

Meanwhile, a novel Multi-Scale Attention head allows the network to better

them do not scale well to large datasets and require the choice of some (very

efficient detection methods become strictly necessary. We propose an
unsupervised method for detecting anomalies and changes in remote sensing

estimate multivariate densities accurately, a long-standing problem in

multivariate data into a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Since the

one can estimate the probability at any point of the original domain. The
assumption is straightforward: pixels with low estimated probability are
considered anomalies. Our method can describe any multivariate distribution,
makes an efficient use of memory and computational resources, and is
parameter-free. We show the efficiency of the method in experiments involving
both anomaly detection and change detection in different remote sensing image

drift of the Fabry-P\'erot interferometer installed at the Habitable-zone

depends on wavelength. Here, we present a similar study of the Espresso
Fabry-P\'erot interferometer. Using daily calibrations spanning a period of
over 2.5 years, we also find clear evidence for a chromatic drift with an
amplitude of a few cm/s per day that has a characteristic, quasi-oscillatory
dependence on wavelength. We conclude that this effect is probably caused by an
aging of the dielectric mirror coatings and expect that similar chromatic
drifts might affect all Fabry-P\'erot interferometers used for calibration of
astronomical spectrographs. However, we also demonstrate that the chromatic
drift can be measured and in principle corrected using only standard
calibrations based on hollow cathode lamp spectra.

non-Hermitian systems because of their potential applications. Here we propose
theoretically and demonstrate a general scheme experimentally to construct Nth
power root (NPR) topological phases. Such a scheme is not only suitable for
Hermitian systems, but also non-Hermitian systems. It is found that the robust
degree of edge state in the Hermitian system becomes stronger and stronger with
the increase of N. It tends to be a strongly surface localized form when N is
large enough. In the non-Hermitian system, the skin effect becomes more
apparent, and it approaches the ideal situation with the increase of N. This
means that edge states and skin effects can be observed by taking different N.
This scheme has been proved experimentally by designing circuits. Our work
opens up a new way to engineer topological states according to the
requirements, which is very important for developing topologically protected
devices, such as topology sensing, switches, and so on.

developed and deployed for astronomical applications in the visible and near
infrared and for sub-millimetre astronomy. One of the main drawbacks of MKIDs
is that large arrays would exhibit a pixel yield, the percentage of
individually distinguishable pixels to the total number of pixels, of 75 - 80
%. Imperfections arising during the fabrication can induce an uncontrolled
shift in the resonance frequency of individual resonators which can end up
resonating at the same frequency of a different resonator. This makes a number
of resonators indistinguishable and therefore unusable for imaging. This paper
proposes an approach to individually re-tune the colliding resonators in order
to remove the degeneracy and increase the number of MKIDs with unique resonant
frequencies. The frequency re-tuning is achieved through a DC bias of the
resonator, the kinetic inductance of a superconducting thin film is current
dependent and its dependence is non linear. Even though this approach has been
already proposed, an innovative pixel design, described in this paper, may
solve two issues previously described in literature such as increased
electromagnetic losses to the DC-bias line, and the multiplexibility of
multiple resonators on a single feedline.

sensitive to such morphosyntactic changes. To this end, we first compare the
performance of grammatical profiles against that of a multilingual neural

the two approaches in ensembles to assess their complementarity. Our results
show that ensembling grammatical profiles with XLM-R improves semantic change
detection performance for most datasets and languages. This indicates that
language models do not fully cover the fine-grained morphological and syntactic
signals that are explicitly represented in grammatical profiles.
  An interesting exception are the test sets where the time spans under
analysis are much longer than the time gap between them (for example,
century-long spans with a one-year gap between them). Morphosyntactic change is
slow so grammatical profiles do not detect in such cases. In contrast, language
models, thanks to their access to lexical information, are able to detect fast

non-crystallographic ones, and a Clifford algebra framework for both these
concepts. A review of historical as well as more recent work on viral capsid
symmetries motivates the focus on the icosahedral root system $H_3$. We discuss
a notion of affine extension for non-crystallographic groups with applications
to fullerenes and viruses. The icosahedrally ordered component of the nucleic
acid within the virus capsid and the interaction between the two have shed
light on the viral assembly process with interesting applications to antiviral
therapies, drug delivery and nanotechnology. The Clifford algebra framework is
very natural, as it uses precisely the structure that is already implicit in
this root system and reflection group context, i.e. a vector space with an
inner product. In addition, it affords a uniquely simple reflection formula, a
double cover of group transformations, and more insight into the geometry, e.g.
the geometry of the Coxeter plane. This approach made possible a range of root
system induction proofs, such as the constructions of $E_8$ from $H_3$ and the
exceptional 4D root systems from 3D root systems. This makes explicit various
connections between what Arnold called Trinities (sets of three exceptional
cases). In fact this generalises further since the induction construction
contains additional cases, namely two infinite families of cases. It therefore
actually yields $ADE$ correspondences between three sets of different
mathematical concepts that are usually thought of separately as polytopes,
subgroups of $SU(2)$ and $ADE$ Lie algebras. Here we connect them explicitly

Here, stress relaxation tests were performed at four different temperatures on

different oxygen content), Ti-6Al-4V (two microstructures with differing beta
phase fractions) and Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-xMo (two alloys with different Mo content

dependent plasticity were determined as a function of temperature. Both
activation volume and energy were found to increase with temperature in all six
alloys. It was found that the dwell fatigue effect is more significant by
oxygen alloying but is suppressed by the addition of Mo. The presence of the
beta phase did not strongly affect the dwell fatigue, however, it was
suppressed at high temperature due to the low strain rate and strain rate
sensitivity.

many balls into a finite number of bins. In these models a ball is placed into
a bin with probability proportional to a given function (feedback function),
which depends on the number of existing balls in the bin. Typically, the
feedback function is the same for all bins (symmetric feedback), and there are
no constraints on the number of balls in the bins. In this paper we study
versions of BB models with two bins, in which the above assumptions are
violated. In the first model of interest the feedback functions can depend on a
bin (BB model with asymmetric feedback). In the case when both feedback
functions are power law and superlinear, a single bin receives all but finitely
many balls almost surely, and we study the probability that this happens for a
given bin. In particular, under certain initial conditions we derive the normal
approximation for this probability, which generalizes the result in [5]
obtained in the case of the symmetric feedback. The main part of the paper
concerns the BB model with asymmetric feedback evolving subject to certain
constraints on the numbers of allocated balls. The model can be interpreted as
a transient reflecting random walk in a curvilinear wedge, and we obtain a
complete classification of its long term behavior.

framework based on incrementally merging local 2D occupancy grid maps (2D-OGM).
Specifically, the contributions of our LiDAR Road-Atlas representation are
threefold. First, we solve the challenging problem of creating local 2D-OGM in
non-structured urban scenes based on a real-time delimitation of traversable
and curb regions in LiDAR point cloud. Second, we achieve accurate 3D mapping
in multiple-layer urban road scenarios by a probabilistic fusion scheme. Third,
we achieve very efficient 3D map representation of general environment thanks
to the automatic local-OGM induced traversable-region labeling and a sparse
probabilistic local point-cloud encoding. Given the LiDAR Road-Atlas, one can
achieve accurate vehicle localization, path planning and some other tasks. Our
map representation is insensitive to dynamic objects which can be filtered out
in the resulting map based on a probabilistic fusion. Empirically, we compare
our map representation with a couple of popular map representation methods in
robotics and autonomous driving societies, and our map representation is more
favorable in terms of efficiency, scalability and compactness. In addition, we
also evaluate localization accuracy extensively given the created LiDAR
Road-Atlas representations on several public benchmark datasets. With a
16-channel LiDAR sensor, our method achieves an average global localization
errors of 0.26m (translation) and 1.07 degrees (rotation) on the Apollo

allows for a high level of uncertainty. That is, the uncertainty classes of
underlying distributions accommodate disturbances that are of order 1 at the
usual diffusion scale, as opposed to asymptotically vanishing disturbances
studied previously in relation to heavy traffic. A main advantage of the
approach is that the invariance principle underlying diffusion limits makes it
possible to define uncertainty classes in terms of the first two moments only.
The model we consider is a single server queue with multiple job types. The
problem is formulated as a zero sum stochastic game played between the system
controller, who determines scheduling and attempts to minimize an expected
linear holding cost, and an adversary, who dynamically controls the service
time distributions of arriving jobs, and attempts to maximize the cost. The
heavy traffic asymptotics of the game are fully solved. It is shown that an
asymptotically optimal policy for the system controller is to prioritize
according to an index rule and for the adversary it is to select distributions
based on the system's current workload. The workload-to-distribution feedback
mapping is determined by an HJB equation, which also characterizes the game's
limit value. Unlike in the vast majority of results in the heavy traffic
theory, and as a direct consequence of the diffusive size disturbances, the
limiting dynamics under asymptotically optimal play are captured by a
stochastic differential equation where both the drift and the diffusion
coefficients may be discontinuous.

overall top-$k$ items in a total of $n$ items. The Borda counting algorithm
simply counts the cumulative scores for each item from these partial ranking
observations. This generalizes a previous work of a similar nature by Shah et
al. using probabilistic pairwise comparison data. The performance of the Borda
counting algorithm critically depends on the associated score separation
$\Delta_k$ between the $k$-th item and the $(k+1)$-th item. Specifically, we
show that if $\Delta_k$ is greater than certain value, then the top-$k$ items
selected by the algorithm is asymptotically accurate almost surely; if
$\Delta_k$ is below certain value, then the result will be inaccurate with a
constant probability. In the special case of $m=2$, i.e., pairwise comparison,
the resultant bound is tighter than that given by Shah et al., leading to a
reduced gap between the error probability upper and lower bounds. These results
are further extended to the approximate top-$k$ selection setting. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the Borda counting
algorithm, compared with the spectral MLE-based algorithm, particularly when
the data does not necessarily follow an assumed parametric model.

mechanism and allow moderately large coupling strength $h_{ij}$ even for
triplet VEVs of order GeV. With low scale RH neutrino mass scale of order
$10^2\sim 10^4$ TeV, the new physics contribution to $\Delta m_W$ can reach

alternatively, it requires out-of-core management to load data into the memory
hierarchy as a part of the rendering loop. Instead of out-of-core memory
management, we propose to procedurally generate the scene on-demand on the fly.
The key idea is a positional- and view-dependent procedural scene-construction
strategy, where only a fraction of the atomistic scene around the camera is
available in the GPU memory at any given time. The atomistic detail is
populated into a uniform-space partitioning using a grid that covers the entire

populated in a compute shader and its representation is connected with
acceleration data structures for hardware ray-tracing of modern GPUs. Objects
which are far away, where atomistic detail is not perceivable from a given

generated from the rendering of geometry from atomistic detail. The algorithm
consists of two pipelines, the construction computes pipeline and the rendering
pipeline, which work together to render molecular scenes at an atomistic
resolution far beyond the limit of the GPU memory containing trillions of
atoms. We demonstrate our technique on multiple models of SARS-CoV-2 and the

We test various types of AEs, each crafted using a specific norm constraint,
which affects their visual appearance and eventually their behavior in the

distances to class-specific manifolds, regardless of the changing dimensions
throughout the network. Using these methods, we consistently confirm that some
of the adversarials do not necessarily leave the proximity of the manifold of
the correct class, not even in the last hidden layer of the neural network.

brains remains challenging, time-consuming and error-prone. Recently,
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods have shown promising results for
this task. These methods rely on training data sets that solely contain healthy
samples. Compared to supervised approaches, this significantly reduces the need
for an extensive amount of labeled training data. However, data labelling
remains error-prone. We study how unhealthy samples within the training data
affect anomaly detection performance for brain MRI-scans. For our evaluations,
we consider three publicly available data sets and use autoencoders (AE) as a
well-established baseline method for UAD. We systematically evaluate the effect
of impured training data by injecting different quantities of unhealthy samples
to our training set of healthy samples from T1-weighted MRI-scans. We evaluate
a method to identify falsely labeled samples directly during training based on
the reconstruction error of the AE. Our results show that training with impured
data decreases the UAD performance notably even with few falsely labeled
samples. By performing outlier removal directly during training based on the
reconstruction-loss, we demonstrate that falsely labeled data can be detected
and removed to mitigate the effect of falsely labeled data. Overall, we
highlight the importance of clean data sets for UAD in brain MRI and
demonstrate an approach for detecting falsely labeled data directly during
training.

post-mergers using a dataset of 160,000 simulated images from IllustrisTNG100
that resemble observed deep imaging of galaxies with Hubble. We improve upon
previous methods of machine learning with imaging by developing a new approach
to deal with the complexities of contamination from neighbouring sources in
crowded fields and define a quality control limit based on overlapping sources
and background flux. Our pipeline successfully separates post-mergers from star
forming galaxies in IllustrisTNG $80\%$ of the time, which is an improvement by
at least 25\% in comparison to a classification using the asymmetry ($A$) of
the galaxy. Compared with measured S\'ersic profiles, we show that star forming
galaxies in the CANDELS fields are predominantly disc-dominated systems while
post-mergers show distributions of transitioning discs to bulge-dominated
galaxies. With these new measurements, we trace the rate of post-mergers among

  https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2022/papers.html",,,,"cs.LG physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As acute climate change impacts weather and climate variability, there is
increased demand for robust climate impact model predictions from which
forecasts of the impacts can be derived. The quality of those predictions are
limited by the climate drivers for the impact models which are nonlinear and
highly variable in nature. One way to estimate the uncertainty of the model
drivers is to assess the distribution of ensembles of climate forecasts. To
capture the uncertainty in the impact model outputs associated with the
distribution of the input climate forecasts, each individual forecast ensemble
member has to be propagated through the physical model which can imply high
computational costs. It is therefore desirable to train a surrogate model which
allows predictions of the uncertainties of the output distribution in ensembles
of climate drivers, thus reducing resource demands. This study considers a
climate driven disease model, the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM), which predicts
the malaria transmission coefficient R0. Seasonal ensembles forecasts of
temperature and precipitation with a 6-month horizon are propagated through the
model, predicting the distribution of transmission time series. The input and
output data is used to train surrogate models in the form of a Random Forest
Quantile Regression (RFQR) model and a Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)
neural network. Comparing the predictive performance, the RFQR better predicts
the time series of the individual ensemble member, while the BLSTM offers a
direct way to construct a combined distribution for all ensemble members. An
important element of the proposed methodology is that accounting for non-normal
distributions of climate forecast ensembles can be captured naturally by a
Bayesian formulation.

  Classification","This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks
  and Learning Systems",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditionally, deep learning methods for breast cancer classification perform
a single-view analysis. However, radiologists simultaneously analyze all four
views that compose a mammography exam, owing to the correlations contained in
mammography views, which present crucial information for identifying tumors. In
light of this, some studies have started to propose multi-view methods.
Nevertheless, in such existing architectures, mammogram views are processed as
independent images by separate convolutional branches, thus losing correlations
among them. To overcome such limitations, in this paper we propose a novel
approach for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized
hypercomplex neural networks. Thanks to hypercomplex algebra properties, our
networks are able to model, and thus leverage, existing correlations between
the different views that comprise a mammogram, thus mimicking the reading
process performed by clinicians. The proposed methods are able to handle the
information of a patient altogether without breaking the multi-view nature of
the exam. We define architectures designed to process two-view exams, namely
PHResNets, and four-view exams, i.e., PHYSEnet and PHYBOnet. Through an
extensive experimental evaluation conducted with publicly available datasets,
we demonstrate that our proposed models clearly outperform real-valued
counterparts and also state-of-the-art methods, proving that breast cancer
classification benefits from the proposed multi-view architectures. We also
assess the method's robustness beyond mammogram analysis by considering
different benchmarks, as well as a finer-scaled task such as segmentation. Full

probabilities with invisible neutrino decay, where matter effects have been
explicitly included. We take into account the possibility that the oscillation
and decay components of the effective Hamiltonian do not commute. This is
achieved by employing the techniques of inverse Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH)
expansion and the Cayley-Hamilton theorem applied in the 3-flavor framework. If
only the vacuum mass eigenstate $\nu_3$ decays, we show that the treatment of
neutrino propagation may be reduced to an effective 2-flavor analysis in the
One Mass Scale Dominance (OMSD) approximation. The oscillation probabilities
for $P_{\mu\mu}$, $P_{ee}$, $P_{e\mu}$ and $P_{\mu e}$ -- relevant for reactor,
long baseline and atmospheric neutrino experiments -- are obtained as
perturbative expansions for the case of only $\nu_3$ decay, as well as for the
more general scenario where all components of the decay matrix are non-zero.
The analytic results thus obtained match the exact numerical results for
constant density matter to a high precision and provide physical insights into
possible effects of the decay of neutrinos as they propagate through Earth
matter. We find that the effects of neutrino decay are most likely to be
observable in $P_{\mu\mu}$. We also point out that at any long baseline, the
oscillation dips in $P_{\mu\mu}$ can show higher survival probabilities in the
case with decay than without decay, and explain this feature using our analytic
approximations.

velocity (RV) measurements is limited by noise sources from the surfaces of
host stars. Current techniques to suppress stellar magnetic activity rely on
decorrelation using an activity indicator (e.g., strength of the Ca II lines,
width of the cross-correlation function, broadband photometry) or measurement
of the RVs using only a subset of spectral lines that have been shown to be
insensitive to activity. Here, we combine the above techniques by constructing
a high signal-to-noise activity indicator, the depth metric $\mathcal{D}(t)$,
from the most activity-sensitive spectral lines using the ""line-by-line"" method
of Dumusque (2018). Analogous to photometric decorrelation of RVs or Gaussian
progress regression modeling of activity indices, time series modeling of
$\mathcal{D}(t)$ reduces the amplitude of magnetic activity in RV measurements;
in an $\alpha$CenB RV time series from HARPS, the RV RMS was reduced from 2.67
to 1.02 m s$^{-1}$. $\mathcal{D}(t)$ modeling enabled us to characterize
injected planetary signals as small as 1 m s$^{-1}$. In terms of noise
reduction and injected signal recovery, $\mathcal{D}(t)$ modeling outperforms
activity mitigation via the selection of activity-insensitive spectral lines.
For Sun-like stars with activity signals on the m s$^{-1}$ level, the depth
metric independently tracks rotationally modulated and multiyear stellar
activity with a level of quality similar to that of the FWHM of the CCF and
log$R^{\prime}_{HK}$. The depth metric and its elaborations will be a powerful
tool in the mitigation of stellar magnetic activity, particularly as a means of
connecting stellar activity to physical processes within host stars.

Experiments on the Google ChAII dataset show that fine-tuning the mBERT model

prevents such degradation with cross-lingual family translations and leads to
marginal improvement. The code for this work is available at

are at odds with observations of the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and
lithium depletion patterns of pre main sequence (PMS) stars in clusters. In
this work we select 1,246 high probability K/M-type constituent members of 5
young open clusters (5--125\,Myr) in the Gaia-ESO Survey to test a series of
models that use standard input physics and others that incorporate surface
magnetic fields or cool starspots. We find that: standard models provide
systematically under-luminous isochrones for low-mass stars in the CMD and fail
to predict Li-depletion of the right strength at the right colour; magnetic
models provide better CMD fits with isochrones that are $\sim 1.5-2$ times
older, and provide better matches to Li depletion patterns. We investigate how
rotation periods, most of which are determined here for the first time from
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, correlate with CMD position and Li.
Among the K-stars in the older clusters we find the brightest and least
Li-depleted are the fastest rotators, demonstrating the classic ""Li-rotation
connection"" for the first time at $\sim 35$ Myr in NGC 2547, and finding some
evidence that it exists in the early M-stars of NGC 2264 at $<10\,$Myr.
However, the wide dispersion in Li depletion observed in fully-convective
M-dwarfs in the $\gamma$ Vel cluster at $\sim 20$ Myr appears not to be
correlated with rotation and is challenging to explain without a very large

mechanism into information aggregation of graph, the GCAFM, including three

When the number $p$ of covariates is of the same order as the number $N$ of
observations, statistical inference like maximum likelihood estimation of
regression and nuisance parameters in the model becomes unreliable due to
overfitting. This overfitting most often leads to systematic biases in (some
of) the estimators. In the literature, several methods to overcome overfitting
bias or to adjust estimates have been proposed. The vast majority of these
focus on the regression parameters only, either via empirical regularization
methods or by expansion for small ratios $p/N$. This failure to correctly
estimate also the nuisance parameters may lead to significant errors in outcome
predictions. In this paper we study the overfitting bias of maximum likelihood
estimators for regression and the nuisance parameters in parametric regression
models in the overfitting regime ($p/N<1$). We compute the asymptotic
characteristic function of the maximum likelihood estimators, and show how it
can be used to estimate their overfitting biases by solving a small set of
non-linear equations. These estimated biases enable us to correct the
estimators and make them asymptotically unbiased. To illustrate the theory we
performed simulation studies for multiple parametric regression models. In all
cases we find excellent agreement between theory and simulations.

keV. A log-parabola function is used to fit the PRS in 2-250 keV, and the
curvature of the spectrum, i.e., the evolution of the photon index with energy,
as represented by the parameter \{beta} of the log-parabola model, also changes
with phase. The relation of \{beta} and phase has two turning points slightly
later than those of the pulse intensity profile, where the values of \{beta}
are the lowest, suggesting that the energy-loss rate of the particles is the
lowest in the corresponding regions. A three-segment broken-power-law model is
also used to fit those PRS. The differences between the hard spectral index and
the soft ones have a distribution similar to that of \{beta}, confirming the
fitting results of the log-parabola model, while the broken energies are
generally higher in the region bridging the two pulses. We find
anticorrelations between the spectral indices and the curvature of the
log-parabola model fitting and a similar anticorrelation between the spectral
indices and broken energies of the broken-power-law model fitting, suggesting a
scenario where the highest-energy particles are produced in regions where
radiation energy loss is strongest.

zero-shot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that
they were not explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining
objectives used across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there
has been limited systematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we
present a large-scale evaluation of modeling choices and their impact on
zero-shot generalization. In particular, we focus on text-to-text models and
experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and
encoder-decoder), trained with two different pretraining objectives
(autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without
multitask prompted finetuning. We train models with over 5 billion parameters
for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby increasing the likelihood that our
conclusions will transfer to even larger scales. Our experiments show that
causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling
objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization after purely
unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their
input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed by multitask
finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore consider the
adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives. We find
that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant
generative causal decoder models, using autoregressive language modeling as a
downstream task. Furthermore, we find that pretrained causal decoder models can
be efficiently adapted into non-causal decoder models, ultimately achieving
competitive performance after multitask finetuning. Code and checkpoints are

models, we built a toy model where the kink's vibrational mode turns into a
quasinormal mode. This causes the suppression of resonance windows and,
consequently, its fractal structure is lost. Considering a higher order
polynomial as the scalar field potential, we find kinks with long-range tails,
which decay as a power law. We developed a numerical method to correctly
initialize this systems and applied it to a scalar field model containing kinks
with long-range tails in both sides. After the collision, the kink-antikink
pair is annihilated for velocities below an ultra-relativistic critical
velocity without bion formation. We also investigated a collision between
wobbling kinks of the double sine-Gordon model. When the kinks are already
wobbling before colliding, there appears resonance windows with separation
after a single bounce. On the second half of the thesis, we focused on
fermion-kink interactions. We studied what happens when a fermion binds to a
wobbling kink. The result is that the fermion escapes from the kink as
radiation and at a constant rate. This occurs if the energy gap between the
initial state and the continuum threshold is not too large. Lastly, we
investigated the interaction of a fermion with a background scalar field with
an impurity that preserves half of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS)

methods mainly focus on a single type of distortion, such as speech denoising
or dereverberation. However, speech signals can be degraded by several
different distortions simultaneously in the real world. It is thus important to
extend speech restoration models to deal with multiple distortions. In this
paper, we introduce VoiceFixer, a unified framework for high-fidelity speech
restoration. VoiceFixer restores speech from multiple distortions (e.g., noise,
reverberation, and clipping) and can expand degraded speech (e.g., noisy
speech) with a low bandwidth to 44.1 kHz full-bandwidth high-fidelity speech.
We design VoiceFixer based on (1) an analysis stage that predicts
intermediate-level features from the degraded speech, and (2) a synthesis stage
that generates waveform using a neural vocoder. Both objective and subjective
evaluations show that VoiceFixer is effective on severely degraded speech, such
as real-world historical speech recordings. Samples of VoiceFixer are available

to solve many real-life problems. One of the most effective strategies to
control catastrophic forgetting, the Achilles' heel of continual learning, is
storing part of the old data and replaying them interleaved with new
experiences (also known as the replay approach). Generative replay, which is
using generative models to provide replay patterns on demand, is particularly
intriguing, however, it was shown to be effective mainly under simplified
assumptions, such as simple scenarios and low-dimensional data. In this paper,
we show that, while the generated data are usually not able to improve the
classification accuracy for the old classes, they can be effective as negative
examples (or antagonists) to better learn the new classes, especially when the
learning experiences are small and contain examples of just one or few classes.
The proposed approach is validated on complex class-incremental and
data-incremental continual learning scenarios (CORe50 and ImageNet-1000)
composed of high-dimensional data and a large number of training experiences: a
setup where existing generative replay approaches usually fail.

of great scientific interest, they are however, also highly challenging. This
is due to the typical low signal to noise and the potential for significant
systematic errors. Both issues are made worse by the transient nature of the
events which prompt one to observe a large portion of the sky. The POLAR
instrument was designed as a dedicated transient gamma-ray polarimeter. It made
use of a large effective area and large field of view to maximize the signal to
noise as well as the number of observed transients. Additionally, it was
calibrated carefully on ground and in orbit to mitigate systematic errors. The
main scientific goal of POLAR was to measure the polarization of the prompt
emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts. During the 6 months operation in orbit POLAR
observed 55 Gamma-Ray Bursts of which 14 were bright enough to allow for
constraining polarization measurements. In this chapter we mainly discuss about
the POLAR instrument along with the calibration and analysis procedures. Two
analyses are described, the first is a straightforward method previously
implemented in polarization measurements, whilst the second was developed to
improve the sensitivity and to mitigate several of the issues with the former.

The strong annual cycle includes an apparent ""standstill"" in April and another

anisotropy in the scintillation pattern. The cycle implies a very high degree
of anisotropy, with an axial ratio of at least 13:1, and the fit is consistent
with a purely one-dimensional scintillation pattern. The position angle of the
anisotropy, and the transverse velocity component are tightly constrained. The
parameters are inconsistent with expectations from a previously proposed model
of scattering associated with plasma filaments radially oriented around hot

reason, the knowledge of pole positions and residues in the complex energy
plane is not sufficient for a quantitative description of the patterns produced

S-matrix element in the complex plane of the total angular momentum. The
approach was recently implemented in a computer code ICS_Regge, available in

the ICS Regge package to analyse in detail, for the first time, the resonance

Regge oscillations. Complex energies of metastable states and Regge pole

assumption that outflows are driven by a wide angle ""X-wind,"" rather than a
narrow jet. However, the arguments initially raised against pure jet-driven
flows were based on steady ejection in a uniform medium, a notion that is no
longer supported based on recent observations. We aim to determine whether a
pulsed narrow jet launched in a density-stratified, self-gravitating core could
reproduce typical molecular outflow properties, without the help of a
wide-angle wind component. We performed axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations
using the MPI-AMRVAC code with optically thin radiative cooling on timescales
up to 10000 yrs. Then we computed and compared the predicted properties with
observational data. First, the jet-driven shell expands faster and wider
through a core with steeply decreasing density than through an uniform core.
Second, when blown into the same singular flattened core, a jet-driven shell
has a similar width as a wide-angle wind-driven shell in the first few hundred
years, but a decelerating expansion on long timescales. The flow adopts a
conical shape and a base opening angle reaching up to $90\unicode{xb0}$. Third,
after $\sim$ 10000 yrs, a pulsed jet-driven shell shows fitting features and a
qualitative resemblance with recent observations of protostellar outflows with
the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), such as HH46-47 and CARMA-7. In
particular, similarities are seen in the shell widths, opening angles,
position-velocity diagrams, and mass-velocity distribution, with some showing a
closer resemblance than in simulations based on a wide-angle ""X-wind"" model.
Therefore, a realistic ambient density stratification in addition to
millenia-long integration times are equally essential to reliably predict the
properties of outflows driven by a pulsed jet and to confront them with the
observations.

corresponding implications on choosing an appropriate graph density. A prime
example is flight planning, i.e., the computation of optimal routes in view of
flight time and fuel consumption under given weather conditions. Highly
efficient discrete shortest path algorithms exist and can be used directly for
computing starting points for locally convergent optimal control methods. We
derive a priori and localized error bounds for the flight time of discrete
paths relative to the optimal continuous trajectory, in terms of the graph
density and the given wind field. These bounds allow designing graphs with an
optimal local connectivity structure. The properties of the bounds are
illustrated on a set of benchmark problems. It turns out that localization
improves the error bound by four orders of magnitude, but still leaves ample
opportunities for tighter error bounds by a posteriori estimators.

This question has remained challenging to answer, due both to the difficulties

constraints of laboratory research with non-model taxa. However, a recent
methodological development in functional genomics, the massively parallel
reporter assay (MPRA), makes it possible to test thousands to millions of
sequences for regulatory activity in a single in vitro experiment. It does so
by combining traditional, single-locus episomal reporter assays (e.g.,
luciferase reporter assays) with the scalability of high-throughput sequencing.
In this perspective, we discuss the execution, advantages, and limitations of
MPRAs for research in evolutionary biology. We review recent studies that have
made use of this approach to address explicitly evolutionary questions,
highlighting study designs that we believe are particularly well-positioned to
gain from MPRA approaches. Additionally, we propose solutions for extending
these powerful assays to rare taxa and those with limited genomic resources. In

  Meteorological Society",,"10.1002/qj.4355",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While it is known that trapped lee waves propagating at low levels in a
stratified atmosphere exert a drag on the mountains that generate them, the
distribution of the corresponding reaction force exerted on the atmospheric
mean circulation, defined by the wave momentum flux profiles, has not been
established, because for inviscid trapped lee waves these profiles oscillate
indefinitely downstream. A framework is developed here for the unambiguous
calculation of momentum flux profiles produced by trapped lee waves, which
circumvents the difficulties plaguing the inviscid trapped lee wave theory.
Using linear theory, and taking Scorer's two-layer atmosphere as an example,
the waves are assumed to be subject to a small dissipation, expressed as a
Rayleigh damping. The resulting wave pattern decays downstream, so the momentum
flux profile integrated over the area occupied by the waves converges to a
well-defined form. Remarkably, for weak dissipation, this form is independent
of the value of Rayleigh damping coefficient, and the inviscid drag, determined
in previous studies, is recovered as the momentum flux at the surface. The
divergence of this momentum flux profile accounts for the areally-integrated
drag exerted by the waves on the atmosphere. The application of this framework
to this and other types of trapped lee waves potentially enables the
development of physically-based parametrizations of the effects of trapped lee
waves on the atmosphere.

solution of rate-independent systems. Such systems are characterized by a

does in general not admit a time-continuous solution. In order to resolve these
potential discontinuities, the algorithm produces a sequence of state variables
and physical time points as functions of a curve parameter. The main novelty of
our approach in comparison to existing methods is an adaptive choice of the
step size for the update of the curve parameter depending on a prescribed
tolerance for the residua in the energy-dissipation balance and in a
complementarity relation concerning the so-called local stability condition. It
is proven that, for tolerance tending to zero, the piecewise affine
approximations generated by the algorithm converge (weakly) to a so-called
$\mathbb{V}$-parametrized balanced viscosity solution. Numerical experiments
illustrate the theoretical findings and show that an adaptive choice of the
step size indeed pays off as they lead to a significant increase of the step
size during sticking and in viscous jumps.

and the risk of death are very relevant for the long-term care of subjects
affected by chronic illnesses, such as potassium in heart failure patients.
Particularly in presence of comorbidities or pharmacological treatments, sudden
crises can cause potassium to undergo very abrupt yet transient changes. In the
context of the monitoring of potassium, there is the need for a dynamic model
that can be used in clinical practice to assess the risk of death related to an
observed patient's potassium trajectory. We considered different dynamic
survival approaches, starting from the simple approach considering the most
recent measurement, to the joint model. We then propose a novel method based on
wavelet filtering and landmarking to retrieve the prognostic role of short-term
potassium oscillations. The data used comes from over 2000 subjects, with a
total of over 80 000 repeated potassium measurements collected through
Administrative Health Records and Outpatient and Inpatient Clinic E-chart. We
claim that while taking into account for past information is important, not all
past information is equally informative. Recent, even if short-term changes in
potassium contain relevant prognostic information. However, we show that these
oscillations are not captured by state-of-the-art dynamic survival models. The
latter are prone to give more importance to the mean long-term value of
potassium. As a consequence, a novel dynamic survival approach is proposed in
this work for the monitoring of potassium in heart failure. The proposed
wavelet landmark method shows promising results revealing the prognostic role
of short-term oscillations, according to their different duration, and
achieving higher performances in predicting survival probability based on
potassium over time.

depends. The sensitivity of a low frequency array, such as an SKA-Low station,
depends strongly on the pointing direction of the digitally formed station beam
and the local sidereal time (LST), and is different for the two orthogonal
polarisations of the antennas. The accurate prediction of the SKA-Low
sensitivity in an arbitrary direction in the sky is crucial for future
observation planning. We present here a sensitivity calculator for the SKA-Low

realisations of an SKA-Low station architecture. One realisation uses the
log-periodic antennas selected for SKA-Low. The second uses a known benchmark,

(deployed at the MRO in 2019) were used to measure their sensitivity at

SQLite database were pre-computed for the X, Y and Stokes I polarisations in 10
MHz frequency steps, 0.5 hour LST intervals, and 5 degree resolution in
pointing directions. The database allows users to estimate the sensitivity of
SKA-Low for their favourite object using interactive web-based or command line

[Nature 574, 505 (2019)] and on the Zuchongzhi quantum processor with 56 qubits

therapies (ACT), specifically for genetically engineered T-cell receptors
(TCRs), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, is target antigen
heterogeneity. It is thought that intratumor heterogeneity is one of the
leading determinants of therapeutic resistance and treatment failure. While
understanding antigen heterogeneity is important for effective therapeutics, a
good therapy strategy could enhance the therapy efficiency. In this work we
introduce an agent-based model to rationalize the outcomes of two types of ACT
therapies over heterogeneous tumors: antigen specific ACT therapy and
multi-antigen recognition ACT therapy. We found that one dose of antigen
specific ACT therapy should be expected to reduce the tumor size as well as its
growth rate, however it may not be enough to completely eliminate it. A second
dose also reduced the tumor size as well as the tumor growth rate, but, due to
the intratumor heterogeneity, it turned out to be less effective than the
previous dose. Moreover, an interesting emergent phenomenon results from the
simulations, namely the formation of a shield-like structure of cells with low
oncoprotein expression. This shield turns out to protect cells with high
oncoprotein expression. On the other hand, our studies suggest that the earlier
the multi-antigen recognition ACT therapy is applied, the more efficient it
turns. In fact, it could completely eliminate the tumor. Based on our results,
it is clear that a proper therapeutic strategy could enhance the therapies
outcomes. In that direction, our computational approach provides a framework to
model treatment combinations in different scenarios and explore the
characteristics of successful and unsuccessful treatments.

The distributed energy storage system leads to more stable operation with

numerous generative GRL models have been proposed, many approaches have
prohibitive computational requirements hampering large-scale network analysis,
fewer are able to explicitly account for structure emerging at multiple scales,
and only a few explicitly respect important network properties such as
homophily and transitivity. This paper proposes a novel scalable graph
representation learning method named the Hierarchical Block Distance Model
(HBDM). The HBDM imposes a multiscale block structure akin to stochastic block
modeling (SBM) and accounts for homophily and transitivity by accurately
approximating the latent distance model (LDM) throughout the inferred
hierarchy. The HBDM naturally accommodates unipartite, directed, and bipartite
networks whereas the hierarchy is designed to ensure linearithmic time and
space complexity enabling the analysis of very large-scale networks. We
evaluate the performance of the HBDM on massive networks consisting of millions
of nodes. Importantly, we find that the proposed HBDM framework significantly
outperforms recent scalable approaches in all considered downstream tasks.
Surprisingly, we observe superior performance even imposing ultra-low
two-dimensional embeddings facilitating accurate direct and hierarchical-aware

and surface tension all change their temperature dependence. These drastic
changes were associated with water gradually changing its mesoscopic structure:
while at the higher temperatures water is a uniform media (amorphous state), at
the temperatures below transition it consists of many nano-to-micro-scale
clusters (crystalline state). This transition is similar to the second order
phase transition. In the present paper we show that treating water with
non-thermal plasma (adding plasma-created active compounds) can lower the
temperature of the transition and thus cause a significant change in such
physical quantities as surface tension, viscosity, freezing rate, and
wettability and washability. We present analytical estimates of the transition

should still be able to learn fast in a new environment. We identify two
challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL) under such a lifelong learning
setting with off-policy data: first, existing off-policy algorithms struggle
with the trade-off between being conservative to maintain good performance in
the old environment and learning efficiently in the new environment, despite
keeping all the data in the replay buffer. We propose the Offline Distillation
Pipeline to break this trade-off by separating the training procedure into an
online interaction phase and an offline distillation phase.Second, we find that
training with the imbalanced off-policy data from multiple environments across
the lifetime creates a significant performance drop. We identify that this
performance drop is caused by the combination of the imbalanced quality and
size among the datasets which exacerbate the extrapolation error of the
Q-function. During the distillation phase, we apply a simple fix to the issue
by keeping the policy closer to the behavior policy that generated the data. In
the experiments, we demonstrate these two challenges and the proposed solutions
with a simulated bipedal robot walk-ing task across various environment
changes. We show that the Offline Distillation Pipeline achieves better
performance across all the encountered environments without affecting data

used to identify significant areas of interest, gaps, and potential
opportunities, followed by a discussion on the obtained responses. The survey
formulates questions about project demographics, technical approach, and skills
required for the present and the next five years. The study was conducted among
38 ORNL participants between June and July of 2021 and followed the required
guidelines for human subjects training. We plan to use the collected
information to help guide a vision for sustainable, community-based, and
reusable scientific software ecosystems that need to adapt effectively to: i)
the evolving landscape of heterogeneous hardware in the next generation of
instruments and computing (e.g. edge, distributed, accelerators), and ii) data
management requirements for data-driven science using artificial intelligence.

the diversity of topics within the Scratch projects make the analysis process
challenging. Our results nevertheless show that topics from pop and net culture

arbitrary unseen domains due to the domain gap between the available source
domains and unseen target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel label
distribution learning (LDL) method to address the generalizable multi-source
person Re-ID task (i.e., there are multiple available source domains, and the
testing domain is unseen during training), which aims to explore the relation
of different classes and mitigate the domain-shift across different domains so
as to improve the discrimination of the model and learn the domain-invariant
feature, simultaneously. Specifically, during the training process, we produce
the label distribution via the online manner to mine the relation information
of different classes, thus it is beneficial for extracting the discriminative
feature. Besides, for the label distribution of each class, we further revise
it to give more and equal attention to the other domains that the class does
not belong to, which can effectively reduce the domain gap across different
domains and obtain the domain-invariant feature. Furthermore, we also give the
theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively
deal with the domain-shift issue. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the
proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, further
analysis also reveals the superiority of the proposed method.

The transmission and computation process is unified into a two-stage tandem

to the background clouds of strings parameter ($a$), we analyse the Hawking

and two second-order phase transitions occur at a smaller horizon radius.
Indeed, the $G$--$T$ plots exhibit a swallowtail below the critical pressure,
implying that the first-order phase transition is analogous to the liquid-gas
phase transition at a lower temperature and lower critical pressure. To further
examine the analogy between nonsingular-AdS black holes and a liquid-gas

method for fracture transforms the crack nucleation problem into a minimization
problem of the sum of the elastic potential energy and the crack surface
energy. Due to the polyconvexity of the formulation, starting from a crackless
solid, a standard Newton iteration may lead to a solution with no crack, even
though a cracked solution has a lower total energy. As such, the critical load
for cracking is highly overestimated. Here, we propose an algorithm termed
""parallel universe"" algorithm to capture the global minimum. This algorithm has
two key ingredients: (a) a necessary condition for cracking solely based on the
current crackless solution, and (b) beginning from when this condition is met,
Newton iteration with two initial guesses, a crackles one and a cracked one,
will both be performed and the converged candidate solution with lower energy
is accepted as the solution at that load step. Once the cracked candidate
solution is accepted, the crackless one is discarded, i.e., only one universe
is retained. This cracked initial guess is obtained only once for all load
steps by solving a series of similar minimization problems with a progressively
reduced critical crack energy release rate. Numerical examples with isotropic
and anisotropic critical crack energy release rates indicate that the proposed
algorithm is more reliable (as there is no need to retrace) and more efficient
than the standard Newton iteration and a well-known backtracking algorithm.

We analyse these phenomena for (a) longitudinal sound waves in a gas or fluid

inhomogeneous wavefields, the connections between the ponderomotive force,
Stokes drift velocity, kinetic energy, and canonical wave momentum carried by

on the nature of these phenomena, their fine interplay, and can be useful for

of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of

developed for automatic data generation by automatic meshing, boundary setting,

proposed to map the geometric inputs to the hemodynamics predictions in latent

structural elasticity: a process playing a key role in a wide range of
biological and technological systems, including many biological and

states typically exist at specific discrete frequencies, and specific symmetric
waveforms. This discreteness can be an obstacle to resonant control modulation:
deviating from these states, by breaking waveform symmetry or modulating drive
frequency, generally leads to losses in system efficiency. Here, we demonstrate
a new strategy for achieving these modulations at no loss of energetic
efficiency. Leveraging fundamental advances in nonlinear dynamics, we
characterise a new form of structural resonance: band-type resonance,
describing a continuous band of energetically-optimal resonant states existing
around conventional discrete resonant states. These states are a counterexample
to the common supposition that deviation from a linear (or nonlinear) resonant
frequency necessarily involves a loss of efficiency. We demonstrate how
band-type resonant states can be generated via a spectral shaping approach:
with small modifications to the system kinematic and load waveforms, we
construct sets of frequency-modulated and symmetry-broken resonant states that
show equal energetic optimality to their conventional discrete analogues. The
existence of these non-discrete resonant states in a huge range of oscillators

ability to learn more general representations by integrating multiple

contrastive learning tasks. By learning from multiple tasks simultaneously,
GMSS can find a representation that captures all of the tasks thereby
decreasing the chance of overfitting on the original task, i.e., emotion

the intrinsic spatial relationships of different brain regions. Considering the
importance of frequency information in EEG emotional signals, the goal of the
frequency jigsaw puzzle task is to explore the crucial frequency bands for EEG
emotion recognition. To further regularize the learned features and encourage
the network to learn inherent representations, contrastive learning task is
adopted in this work by mapping the transformed data into a common feature

algorithms, but randomly-captured CSI samples can be easily collected.
{\color{black}In this paper, we firstly explore how to learn a robust model

are captured randomly, and then transfers the knowledge to specific tasks
defined by users, which is the first work to achieve cross-task transfer in

evaluation. The AutoFi transfers knowledge from randomly collected CSI samples
into human gait recognition and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Furthermore, we simulate cross-task transfer using public datasets to further

related to how long the system remains at a certain state before changing to a
different one. The study of complex systems' persistence involves different
definitions and uses different techniques, depending on whether short-term or
long-term persistence is considered. In this paper we discuss the most
important definitions, concepts, methods, literature and latest results on
persistence in complex systems. Firstly, the most used definitions of
persistence in short-term and long-term cases are presented. The most relevant
methods to characterize persistence are then discussed in both cases. A
complete literature review is also carried out. We also present and discuss
some relevant results on persistence, and give empirical evidence of
performance in different detailed case studies, for both short-term and
long-term persistence. A perspective on the future of persistence concludes the
work.
