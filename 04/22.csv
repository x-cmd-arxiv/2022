and Zeppenfeld basis in which eight generation-independent operators enter in
the electroweak precision data at tree level and, unlike in the Warsaw basis,
the analysis of that set of data constrains all the eight Wilson coefficients,
without the need of combination with Higgs or electroweak diboson data results.
We show that in the global analysis the determination of the coefficients of
all operators which do not enter the electroweak precision data are barely
affected by the new $M_W$ determination.

different number of propagating transmitted modes. We present these findings in
terms of phase diagrams that is valid for an incoming wave with fixed

phenomenon we then focus on the simplest case of an anisotropic quadratic
Weyl-semimetal and analyze tunneling coefficients analytically and numerically
to confirm the observations from the phase diagram. Our results show
non-analytical behavior, which is the hallmark of a phase transition. This
serves as a motivation to make a formal analogy with phase transitions that are
known from statistical mechanics. Specifically, we argue that the long distance
limit in our tunneling problem takes the place of the thermodynamic limit in
statistical mechanics. More precisely, find a direct formal connection to the
recently developed formalism for dynamical phase transitions [Reports on

new transpose for third-order tensors is introduced. This transpose is crucial
in the verification of Hot-SVD, since it serves as a bridge between tubal

analogous to those of HOSVD, and in doing so we emphasize the perspective of
tubal tensors. The truncated and sequentially truncated Hot-SVD are then
introduced, whose error bounds are $\sqrt{N}$ for an $(N+1)$-th order tensor.

Queries are written in one of the languages supported by the embeddings, and
the extracted sentences can be in any of the other languages supported.
Abstractive summaries are created by transformers. The evaluation, done by
crowdsourcing evaluators and emergency management experts, and carried out on
collections extracted from Twitter during five large-scale disasters spanning

bilevel cost-sensitive SVMs. EBCS-SVM handles imbalanced classification
problems by simultaneously learning the support vectors and optimizing the SVM
hyperparameters, which comprise the kernel parameter and misclassification
costs. The resulting optimization problem is a bilevel problem, where the lower
level determines the support vectors and the upper level the hyperparameters.
This optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) at the
upper level and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) at the lower level. These
two methods work in a nested fashion, that is, the optimal support vectors help
guide the search of the hyperparameters, and the lower level is initialized
based on previous successful solutions. The proposed method is assessed using
70 datasets of imbalanced classification and compared with several

for reducing development cost. However, they could introduce security risks as
well. Many TPL detection methods have been proposed to detect TPL reuse in
Android bytecode or in source code. This paper focuses on detecting TPL reuse
in binary code, which is a more challenging task. For a detection target in
binary form, libraries may be compiled and linked to separate dynamic-link
files or built into a fused binary that contains multiple libraries and
project-specific code. This could result in fewer available code features and
lower the effectiveness of feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a
binary TPL reuse detection framework, LibDB, which can effectively and
efficiently detect imported TPLs even in stripped and fused binaries. In
addition to the basic and coarse-grained features (string literals and exported
function names), LibDB utilizes function contents as a new type of feature. It
embeds all functions in a binary file to low-dimensional representations with a
trained neural network. It further adopts a function call graph-based
comparison method to improve the accuracy of the detection. LibDB is able to
support version identification of TPLs contained in the detection target, which
is not considered by existing detection methods. To evaluate the performance of
LibDB, we construct three datasets for binary-based TPL reuse detection. Our
experimental results show that LibDB is more accurate and efficient than
state-of-the-art tools on the binary TPL detection task and the version
identification task. Our datasets and source code used in this work are

Fair-ML researchers have presented an extensive suite of algorithmic

to the sources of the observed unfairness. As a result, the literature
currently lacks guiding frameworks to specify conditions under which each
algorithmic intervention can potentially alleviate the underpinning cause of
unfairness. To close this gap, we scrutinize the underlying biases (e.g., in
the training data or design choices) that cause observational unfairness. We
present the conceptual idea and a first implementation of a bias-injection
sandbox tool to investigate fairness consequences of various biases and assess
the effectiveness of algorithmic remedies in the presence of specific types of
bias. We call this process the bias(stress)-testing of algorithmic
interventions. Unlike existing toolkits, ours provides a controlled environment
to counterfactually inject biases in the ML pipeline. This stylized setup
offers the distinct capability of testing fairness interventions beyond
observational data and against an unbiased benchmark. In particular, we can
test whether a given remedy can alleviate the injected bias by comparing the
predictions resulting after the intervention in the biased setting with true
labels in the unbiased regime-that is, before any bias injection. We illustrate
the utility of our toolkit via a proof-of-concept case study on synthetic data.
Our empirical analysis showcases the type of insights that can be obtained

decorrelation of the neutron spectator plane and the reaction plane because of
fragmentation of the remnants from the colliding nuclei, which points to an
incompleteness of current models of initial state fluctuations. A significant
transverse momentum dependence of the ratio $v_2${$\Psi_{\rm SP}$}/$v_2${4} is

our Swift UVOT--XRT and Effelsberg radio data (2.6-44 GHz) between 2019 and

observational epoch covers OJ 287 in a high state of activity from radio to
X-rays. The epoch also covers two major events predicted by the binary
supermassive black hole (SMBH) model of OJ 287. Spectral and timing analyses
clearly establish: a new UV-optical minimum state in 2021 December at an epoch
where the secondary SMBH is predicted to cross the disk surrounding the primary
SMBH; an overall low level of gamma-ray activity in comparison to pre-2017
epochs; the presence of a remarkable, long-lasting UV--optical flare event of
intermediate amplitude in 2020--2021; a high level of activity in the radio
band with multiple flares; and particularly a bright, ongoing radio flare
peaking in 2021 November that may be associated with a gamma-ray flare, the
strongest in 6 years. Several explanations for the UV--optical minimum state
are explored, including the possibility that a secondary SMBH launches a
temporary jet, but the observations are best explained by variability
associated with the main jet.

  the Entity Space",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Translation distance based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods, such as
TransE and RotatE, model the relation in knowledge graphs as translation or
rotation in the vector space. Both translation and rotation are injective; that
is, the translation or rotation of different vectors results in different
results. In knowledge graphs, different entities may have a relation with the
same entity; for example, many actors starred in one movie. Such a
non-injective relation pattern cannot be well modeled by the translation or
rotation operations in existing translation distance based KGE methods. To
tackle the challenge, we propose a translation distance-based KGE method called
SpaceE to model relations as linear transformations. The proposed SpaceE embeds
both entities and relations in knowledge graphs as matrices and SpaceE
naturally models non-injective relations with singular linear transformations.
We theoretically demonstrate that SpaceE is a fully expressive model with the
ability to infer multiple desired relation patterns, including symmetry,
skew-symmetry, inversion, Abelian composition, and non-Abelian composition.
Experimental results on link prediction datasets illustrate that SpaceE
substantially outperforms many previous translation distance based knowledge
graph embedding methods, especially on datasets with many non-injective
relations. The code is available based on the PaddlePaddle deep learning

al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2020]. However, both agents rely on the C51 critic
for value estimation.One major drawback of the C51 approach is its requirement
of prior knowledge about the minimum andmaximum values a policy can attain as
well as the number of bins used, which fixes the resolution ofthe
distributional estimate. While the DeepMind control suite of tasks utilizes
standardized rewards and episode lengths, thus enabling the entire suite to be
solved with a single setting of these hyperparameters, this is often not the
case. This paper revisits a natural alternative that removes this requirement,
namelya mixture of Gaussians, and a simple sample-based loss function to train
it in an off-policy regime. We empirically evaluate its performance on a broad
range of continuous control tasks and demonstrate that it eliminates the need
for these distributional hyperparameters and achieves state-of-the-art

face-based gender-, age-classification, and face recognition systems suggest
that these technologies perform poorly for women, dark-skinned people, and
older adults. The bias of facial analysis-based BMI prediction tools has not
been studied until now. This paper evaluates the bias of facial-analysis-based
BMI prediction models across Caucasian and African-American Males and Females.
Experimental investigations on the gender, race, and BMI balanced version of
the modified MORPH-II dataset suggested that the error rate in BMI prediction
was least for Black Males and highest for White Females. Further, the
psychology-related facial features correlated with weight suggested that as the
BMI increases, the changes in the facial region are more prominent for Black
Males and the least for White Females. This is the reason for the least error
rate of the facial analysis-based BMI prediction tool for Black Males and

presented as a function of charged particle multiplicity and rapidity. The
measured $p_{\rm T}$ distributions show a dependence on both multiplicity and
rapidity at low $p_{\rm T}$ whereas no significant dependence is observed at
high $p_{\rm T}$. A rapidity dependence is observed in the $p_{\rm
T}$-integrated yield (d$N$/d$y$), whereas the mean transverse momentum ($\left<
p_{\rm T} \right>$) shows a flat behavior as a function of rapidity. The
rapidity asymmetry ($Y_{\rm asym}$) at low $p_{\rm T}$ ( < 5 GeV/$c$) is more
significant for higher multiplicity classes. At high $p_{\rm T}$, no
significant rapidity asymmetry is observed in none of the multiplicity classes.
Both ${\rm K}^*(892)^0$ and $\phi(1020)$ show similar $Y_{\rm asym}$. The
nuclear modification factor ($Q_{\rm CP}$) as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ shows a
Cronin-like enhancement at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$, which is more prominent at
higher rapidities (Pb-going direction) and in higher multiplicity classes. At
high $p_{\rm T}$ (> 5 GeV/$c$), the $Q_{\rm CP}$ values are greater than unity
and no significant rapidity dependence is observed.

statically configured at design time, sporadic event-triggered (ET) tasks are
handled within specially dedicated slots or when time-triggered (TT) tasks
finish their execution early. We introduce a new paradigm for synthesizing TT
schedules that guarantee the correct temporal behavior of TT tasks and the
schedulability of sporadic ET tasks with arbitrary deadlines. The approach
first expresses a constraint for the TT task schedule in the form of a maximal
affine envelope that guarantees that as long as the schedule generation
respects this envelope, all sporadic ET tasks meet their deadline. The second
step consists of modeling this envelope as a burst limiting constraint and
building the TT schedule via simulating a modified Least-Laxity-First (LLF)
scheduler. Using this novel technique, we show that we achieve equal or better
schedulability and a faster schedule generation for most use-cases compared to
simple polling approaches. Moreover, we present an extension to our method that
finds the most favourable schedule for TT tasks with respect to ET
schedulability, thus increasing the probability of the computed TT schedule
remaining feasible when ET tasks are later added or changed.

symmetry breaking through a mixed quartic coupling between the $U(1)$ Higgs
field and the SM Higgs doublet. For two Higgs boson mass eigenstates after the
symmetry breaking, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs boson) and $h_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs
boson), we calculate the Higgs boson trilinear coupling ($g_{h_{1} h_{2}
h_{2}}$) in the model by setting the Higgs boson mass spectrum to be $M_{h_1} >
2 M_{h_2}$. For a common Higgs mass spectrum and mixing angle between two Higgs
fields, we find that $g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$ in the classically conformal model
is highly suppressed compared to that calculated for the conventional Higgs
potential, where the $U(1)$ and EW symmetry breaking originate from the
negative squared masses for the Higgs fields at the tree-level. Thus, this
coupling suppression is a striking nature of the radiative origin of EW
symmetry breaking. We then consider how to distinguish this origin at the
proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) via precise measurements of
anomalous SM Higgs boson couplings and the search for anomalous SM Higgs boson
decay $h_1 \rightarrow h_2 h_2$ followed by $h_2 \to b \bar{b}$. We conclude
that once the anomalous couplings are measured at the ILC, the observation of

jets in both proton-proton (pp) and heavy-ion collisions with the ALICE
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We report distributions of the
fraction $z_r$ of transverse momentum carried by subjets of radius $r$ within
jets of radius $R$. Charged-particle jets are reconstructed at midrapidity
using the anti-$k_{\rm{T}}$ algorithm with jet radius $R=0.4$, and subjets are
reconstructed by reclustering the jet constituents using the anti-$k_{\rm{T}}$
algorithm with radii $r=0.1$ and $r=0.2$. In proton-proton collisions, we
measure both the inclusive and leading subjet distributions. We compare these
measurements to perturbative calculations at next-to-leading logarithmic
accuracy, which suggest a large impact of threshold resummation and
hadronization effects on the $z_r$ distribution. In heavy-ion collisions, we
measure the leading subjet distributions, which allow access to a region of
harder jet fragmentation than has been probed by previous measurements of jet
quenching via hadron fragmentation distributions. The $z_r$ distributions
enable extraction of the parton-to-subjet fragmentation function and allow for
tests of the universality of jet fragmentation functions in the quark-gluon
plasma (QGP). We find indications that there is a turnover in the ratio between
the distributions in Pb-Pb and pp collisions as $z_r \rightarrow 1$, exposing
qualitatively new possibilities to disentangle competing jet quenching
mechanisms. By comparing our results to theoretical calculations based on an
independent extraction of the parton-to-jet fragmentation function, we find
consistency with the universality of jet fragmentation and no indication of

could fail to capture information regarding important localized chemical
dynamics, such as the formation of ignition kernels, appearing as
\rev{extreme-valued} samples in a dataset. In this paper, we propose an
alternate dimensionality reduction procedure, co-kurtosis PCA (CoK-PCA),
wherein the required principal vectors are computed from a high-order joint
statistical moment, namely the co-kurtosis tensor, which may better identify
directions in the state space that represent stiff dynamics. We first
demonstrate the potential of the proposed CoK-PCA method using a synthetically
generated dataset that is representative of typical combustion simulations.
Thereafter, we characterize and contrast the accuracy of CoK-PCA against PCA
for datasets representing spontaneous ignition of premixed ethylene-air in a
simple homogeneous reactor and ethanol-fueled homogeneous charged compression
ignition (HCCI) engine. Specifically, we compare the low-dimensional manifolds
in terms of reconstruction errors of the original thermo-chemical state, and
species production and heat release rates computed from the reconstructed

rates -- is a more rigorous assessment of the accuracy of dimensionality
reduction.} We find that, even using a simplistic linear reconstruction, the

restrictions on the orthogonal subspaces of its Hilbert space that may be
mapped to one another. Our framework (a) proves that a number of different
intuitions about causal relations turn out to be equivalent; (b) shows that
quantum causal structures in the presence of sectorial constraints can be
represented with a directed graph; and (c) defines a fine-graining of the
causal structure in which the individual sectors of a system bear causal
relations. As an example, we apply our framework to purported photonic
implementations of the quantum switch to show that while their coarse-grained
causal structure is cyclic, their fine-grained causal structure is acyclic. We
therefore conclude that these experiments realize indefinite causal order only

clustering of the energy deposited by an incident particle in different
crystals of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). These clusters are formed
by aggregating neighbouring crystals according to the expected topology of an
electromagnetic shower in the ECAL. The presence of upstream material
(beampipe, tracker and support structures) causes electrons and photons to
start showering before reaching the calorimeter. This effect, combined with the
3.8T CMS magnetic field, leads to energy being spread in several clusters
around the primary one. It is essential to recover the energy contained in
these satellite clusters in order to achieve the best possible energy
resolution for physics analyses. Historically satellite clusters have been
associated to the primary cluster using a purely topological algorithm which
does not attempt to remove spurious energy deposits from additional pileup
interactions (PU). The performance of this algorithm is expected to degrade
during LHC Run 3 (2022+) because of the larger average PU levels and the
increasing levels of noise due to the ageing of the ECAL detector. New methods
are being investigated that exploit state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and self-attention algorithms.
These more sophisticated models improve the energy collection and are more
resilient to PU and noise, helping to preserve the electron and photon energy
resolution achieved during LHC Runs 1 and 2. This work will cover the
challenges of training the models as well the opportunity that this new
approach offers to unify the ECAL energy measurement with the particle

Structural Nested Mean Models (Robins, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004; Lok and
Degruttola, 2012; Vansteelandt and Joffe, 2014) are identified under parallel
trends assumptions. Our methodology enables adjustment for time-varying
covariates, identification of effect heterogeneity as a function of
time-varying covariates, identification of additional causal contrasts (such as
effects of a `blip' of treatment at a single time point followed by no further
treatment and controlled direct effects), and estimation of treatment effects
under a general class of treatment patterns (e.g. we do not restrict to the
`staggered adoption' setting, and treatments can be multidimensional with any
mix of categorical and continuous components). We stress that these extensions
come essentially for free, as our parallel trends assumption is not stronger
than other parallel trends assumptions in the DiD literature. We also provide a
method for sensitivity analysis to violations of our parallel trends
assumption. However, in contrast to much of the DiD literature, we only
consider panel data, not repeated cross sectional data. We also explain how to
estimate optimal treatment regimes via optimal regime Structural Nested Mean
Models under parallel trends assumptions plus an additional extremely strong
assumption that there is no effect modification by unobserved confounders.
Finally, we illustrate our methods with real data applications estimating
effects of bank deregulation on housing prices and effects of floods on flood
insurance take-up.

along the loop. For rectangular or stadium-shaped loops in the plane, we find
that the electric field can undergo a symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation
as the loop is elongated; the field can have either one or three zeros,
depending on the loop's aspect ratio. For knotted charge distributions in
three-dimensional space, we compute the electric field numerically and compare
our results to previously published theoretical bounds on the number of
equilibrium points around charged knots. Our computations reveal that the
previous bounds are far from sharp. The numerics also suggest conjectures for
the actual minimum number of equilibrium points for all charged knots with five
or fewer crossings. In addition, we provide the first images of the
equipotential surfaces around charged knots, and visualize their topological
transitions as the level of the potential is varied.

uncertainty reduction tactics to provide additional information to the

popular adaptation processes enabling it to immediately benefit a large number

remain in stable orbits for billions of years. As a result, they are powerful

Although we have detected thousands of Jupiter Trojans and dozens of Neptune

that such collisions can be highly disruptive to the primordial Trojan

Earth acquired the final 1\% of its mass through ${\cal O}(10)$ collisions,
then only $\sim1\%$ of the previously bound Trojan population would remain.

directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular

grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup

vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the
memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across

primarily focused on its use for various auxiliary pixel- and image-level

In this work, we introduce SelfD, a framework for learning scalable driving by
utilizing large amounts of online monocular images. Our key idea is to leverage
iterative semi-supervised training when learning imitative agents from

making full use of highly diverse demonstration data through ""hypothetical""

First, we experiment with three different mechanisms that enable the network to

APOGEE data to derive the intrinsic density distribution of MAPs in the Milky
Way, after carefully considering the survey selection function. We find that a
single exponential profile is not a sufficient description of the Milky Way's
disc. Both the individual MAPs and the integrated disc exhibit a broken radial
density distribution; densities are relatively constant with radius in the
inner Galaxy and rapidly decrease beyond the break radius. We fit the intrinsic
density distribution as a function of radius and vertical height with a 2D
density model that considers both a broken radial profile and radial variation
of scale height (i.e., flaring). There is a large variety of structural
parameters between different MAPs, indicative of strong structure evolution of
the Milky Way. One surprising result is that high-$\alpha$ MAPs show the
strongest flaring. The young, solar-abundance MAPs present the shortest scale
height and least flaring, suggesting recent and ongoing star formation confined
to the disc plane. Finally we derive the intrinsic density distribution and
corresponding structural parameters of the chemically defined thin and thick
discs. The chemical thick and thin discs have local surface mass densities of
5.62$\pm$0.08 and 15.69$\pm$0.32 ${\rm M_{\odot} pc^{-2}}$, respectively,

based on the slim disc paradigm, and one inspired by recent
radiation-magnetohydrodynamical simulations by Jiang and collaborators.
Radiative feedback has the form of a thermal dump to surrounding gas particles,
with the radiative efficiency being set according to the different SE accretion
models. We find that, in all simulations, star formation, BH feedback, and
interactions between clumps and the BH rapidly quench accretion after
$\sim$1~Myr, irrespective of the sub-grid model used for accretion. Quenching
is stronger in the model based on the simulations of Jiang and collaborators

SE growth phase is always very brief, lasting a few 0.1~Myr. In the most
optimistic case, the BH reaches a mass of $\sim$10$^4$~M$_{\odot}$. We
extrapolate the final BH masses from $z=15$ to $z\sim6$, assuming subsequent
galaxy mergers will replenish the gas reservoir and trigger new cycles of SE

establishing these connections. The complexity of these physics can prove
difficult to disentangle and obfuscate how mass-dependent trends in the galaxy

Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) to infer how the stellar mass and star

noninteracting fermionic systems due to their underlying Pauli repulsion. The
deformation of Pauli crystals - often called melting - has been recently
observed in experiments, but the mechanism that leads to it remains unclear. We
address this question by studying the melting dynamics of N=6 fermions as a
function of periodic driving and experimental imperfections in the trap
(anisotropy and anharmonicity) by employing a combination of numerical
simulations and Floquet theory. Surprisingly, we reveal that the melting of
Pauli crystals is not simply a direct consequence of an increase in system
energy, but is instead related to the trap geometry and the population of the
Floquet modes. We show that the melting is absent in traps without
imperfections and triggered only by a sufficiently large shaking amplitude in
traps with imperfections.

of the SM and the determination of the CKM parameters. As of 2022, among the
four CKM parameters, $V_{us}$ and $\beta$ are already measured with respectable
precision, while this is not the case of $|V_{cb}|$ and $\gamma$. In the case
of $|V_{cb}|$ the main obstacle are the significant tensions between its
inclusive and exclusive determinations from tree-level decays. The present
uncertainty in $\gamma$ of $4^\circ$ from tree-level decays will be reduced to
$1^\circ$ by the LHCb and Belle II collaborations in the coming years.
Unfortunately in the UT plots $|V_{cb}|$ is not seen and the experimental
improvements in the determination of $\gamma$ from tree-level decays at the
level of a few degrees are difficult to appreciate. In view of these
deficiencies of the UT plots with respect to $|V_{cb}|$ and $\gamma$ and the
central role these two CKM parameters will play in this decade, the recently
proposed plots of $|V_{cb}|$ versus $\gamma$ extracted from various processes
appear to be superior to the UT plots in the flavour phenomenology. We
illustrate this idea with $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$, $\epsilon_K$ and with
rare decays $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_d\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $K^+\to \pi^+\nu\bar\nu$

$K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$ and $K_{L}\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)$ in the determination of
$|V_{cb}|$, due to their strong dependence on $|V_{cb}|$, is transparently
exhibited in this manner. Combined with future reduced errors on $\gamma$ and
$|V_{cb}|$ from tree-level decays such plots can better exhibit possible
inconsistenices between various determinations of these two parameters, caused
by new physics, than it is possible with the UT plots.

theoretical requirements, flavor-changing neutral currents in $B$ physics, the

that type II and type Y in the inverted scenario are completely excluded. Such

few keV to PeV can be produced solely from evaporating primordial black holes
(PBH), while being consistent with the required free streaming length for
structure formation. If DM does not have any other interactions apart from
gravity and the universe has a PBH dominated phase at early epoch, then PBH
evaporation typically leads to overproduction of DM in this mass range. By
incorporating this gravitational DM within a Type-I seesaw scenario with three
right handed neutrinos (RHN), we bring the abundance of PBH generated DM within
observed limits by late entropy injection due to decay of one of the RHNs,
acting as the diluter. The diluter, due to its feeble coupling with the bath
particles, gets produced primarily from the PBH evaporation thereby leading to
the second stage of early matter domination after the end of PBH dominated era.
The other two RHNs contribute to the origin of light neutrino mass and also
lead to the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis with contributions from
both thermally and PBH generated RHNs. The criteria of DM relic and baryon
asymmetry can be satisfied simultaneously if DM mass gets restricted to a
ballpark in the MeV-GeV regime with the requirement of resonant leptogenesis
for heavier DM mass in order to survive the large entropy dilution at late
epochs.

  conservation",,,,,"physics.ao-ph math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The model of the Volterra gyrostat (VG) has not only played an important role
in rigid body dynamics but also served as the foundation of low-order models of
many naturally occurring systems. It is well known that VG possesses two
invariants, or constants of motion, corresponding to kinetic energy and squared
angular momentum, giving oscillatory solutions to its equations of motion. Nine
distinct subclasses of the VG have been identified, two of which the Euler
gyroscope and Lorenz gyrostat are each known to have two constants. This paper
characterizes quadratic invariants of the VG and each of its subclasses,
showing how these enjoy two invariants even when rendered in terms of a
non-invertible transformation of parameters, leading to a transformed Volterra
gyrostat (TVG). If the quadratic coefficients of the TVG sum to zero, as they
do for the VG, the system conserves energy. In all of these cases, the flows
preserve volume. However, physical models where the quadratic coefficients do
not sum to zero are ubiquitous, and characterization of invariants and the
resulting dynamics for this more general class of models with volume
conservation but without energy conservation is lacking. This paper provides
the first such characterization for each of the subclasses of the VG in the
absence of energy conservation, showing how the number of invariants depends on
the number of linear feedback terms. It is shown that the gyrostat with three
linear feedback terms has no invariants. The number of invariants circumscribes
the possible dynamics for these three-dimensional flows, and those without any
invariants are shown to admit rich dynamics including chaos. This gives rise to
a broad class of three-dimensional volume conserving chaotic flows, arising
naturally from model reduction techniques.

matrix represents an intricate interplay of enthalpic or entropic forces.
Particle size largely affects the phase behavior of the nanocomposite.
Theoretical studies indicate that new morphologies would emerge when the
particles become comparable to the soft matrix's size, but this has rarely been
supported experimentally. By designing a multicomponent blend composed of NPs,
block copolymer-based supramolecules, and small molecules, a 3-D ordered
lattice beyond the native BCP's morphology was recently reported when the
particle is larger than the microdomain of BCP. The blend can accommodate
various formulation variables. In this contribution, when the particle size
equals the microdomain size, a symmetry-broken phase appears in a narrow range
of particle sizes and compositions, which we named the ""train track"" structure.
In this phase, the NPs aligned into a 3-D hexagonal lattice and packed
asymmetrically along the c axis, making the projection of the ac and the bc
plane resemble train tracks. Computation studies show that the broken symmetry
reduces the polymer chain deformation and stabilizes the metastable hexagonally
perforated lamellar morphology. Given the mobility of the multicomponent blend,
the system shows a self-sorting behavior: segregating into two macroscopic
phases with different nanostructures based on only a few nanometers NP size
differences. Smaller NPs form ""train track"" morphology, while larger NPs form
""simple hexagon"" structure, where the NPs take a symmetric hexagonal
arrangement. Detailed structural evolution and simulation studies confirm the
systematic-wide cooperativity across different components, indicating the
strong self-regulation of the multicomponent system.

neural rankers create a need for novel evaluation methods. If every ranker
returns highly relevant items in the top ranks, it becomes difficult to
recognize meaningful differences between them and to build reusable test
collections. Several recent papers explore pairwise preference judgments as an
alternative to traditional graded relevance assessments. Rather than viewing
items one at a time, assessors view items side-by-side and indicate the one
that provides the better response to a query, allowing fine-grained
distinctions. If we employ preference judgments to identify the probably best
items for each query, we can measure rankers by their ability to place these
items as high as possible. We frame the problem of finding best items as a
dueling bandits problem. While many papers explore dueling bandits for online
ranker evaluation via interleaving, they have not been considered as a
framework for offline evaluation via human preference judgments. We review the
literature for possible solutions. For human preference judgments, any usable
algorithm must tolerate ties, since two items may appear nearly equal to
assessors, and it must minimize the number of judgments required for any
specific pair, since each such comparison requires an independent assessor.
Since the theoretical guarantees provided by most algorithms depend on
assumptions that are not satisfied by human preference judgments, we simulate
selected algorithms on representative test cases to provide insight into their
practical utility. Based on these simulations, one algorithm stands out for its
potential. Our simulations suggest modifications to further improve its
performance. Using the modified algorithm, we collect over 10,000 preference
judgments for submissions to the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, confirming its

state represents a proton in isospin space at one location does not determine
what state represents a proton in isospin space at another location. This is
accounted for by the presence of a unitary gauge transformation operator,
$U(y,x)$, between vector spaces at different locations. This operator defines
the notion of same states for vector spaces at different locations. If $\psi$
is a state in a vector space at $x$ then $U(y,x)\psi$ is the same state in the
vector space at $y$. Vector spaces include scalar fields in their axiomatic
description. These appear as norms, closure under vector scalar multiplication,
etc. This leads to a conflict: local vector spaces and global scalar fields.
Here this conflict is removed by replacing global scalar fields with local
scalar fields. These are represented by $\bar{S}_{x}$ where $x$ is any location
in Euclidean space or space time. Here $S$ represents the different type of
numbers, (natural, integers, rational, real, and complex). The association of
scalar fields with vector spaces and the Yang Mills observation raises the
question, What corresponds to the Yang Mills observation for numbers? The
answer is that two different concepts, number and number meaning or value, are

as recurrence. We define a set to be $\tau$-recurrent (resp. $k$-recurrent) if
every trajectory that starts within the set, returns to it after at most $\tau$
seconds (resp. $k$ steps). We show that under mild assumptions a
$\tau$-recurrent set containing a stable equilibrium must be a subset of its
ROA. We then leverage this property to develop algorithms that compute inner
approximations of the ROA using counter-examples of recurrence that are
obtained by sampling finite-length trajectories. Our algorithms process samples
sequentially, which allow them to continue being executed even after an initial
offline training stage. We further provide an upper bound on the number of
counter-examples used by the algorithm, and almost sure convergence guarantees.

one-size-fits-all commodity DRAM. Unfortunately, although system designers can
theoretically adapt commodity DRAM chips to meet their particular design goals
(e.g., by reducing access timings to improve performance, implementing
system-level RowHammer mitigations), we observe that designers today lack
sufficient insight into commodity DRAM chips' reliability characteristics to
implement these techniques in practice. In this work, we make a case for DRAM
manufacturers to provide increased transparency into key aspects of DRAM
reliability (e.g., basic chip design properties, testing strategies). Doing so
enables system designers to make informed decisions to better adapt commodity
DRAM to meet modern systems' needs while preserving its cost advantages.
  To support our argument, we study four ways that system designers can adapt
commodity DRAM chips to system-specific design goals: (1) improving DRAM
reliability; (2) reducing DRAM refresh overheads; (3) reducing DRAM access
latency; and (4) mitigating RowHammer attacks. We observe that adopting
solutions for any of the four goals requires system designers to make
assumptions about a DRAM chip's reliability characteristics. These assumptions
discourage system designers from using such solutions in practice due to the
difficulty of both making and relying upon the assumption.
  We identify DRAM standards as the root of the problem: current standards
rigidly enforce a fixed operating point with no specifications for how a system
designer might explore alternative operating points. To overcome this problem,
we introduce a two-step approach that reevaluates DRAM standards with a focus
on transparency of DRAM reliability so that system designers are encouraged to
make the most of commodity DRAM technology for both current and future DRAM
chips.

submanifold: a diffeological submanifold.
  We show that from a categorical perspective diffeology rises above the
others: viewing manifolds as a concrete category over the category of sets, the
initial morphisms are exactly the (diffeological) inductions, which are the
diffeomorphisms with diffeological submanifolds. Moreover, if we view manifolds

many possible 3D scenes. Part of the MDE task is, therefore, to learn which
visual cues in the image can be used for depth estimation, and how. With
training data limited by cost of annotation or network capacity limited by
computational power, this is challenging. In this work we demonstrate that
explicitly injecting visual cue information into the model is beneficial for
depth estimation. Following research into biological vision systems, we focus
on semantic information and prior knowledge of object sizes and their
relations, to emulate the biological cues of relative size, familiar size, and
absolute size. We use state-of-the-art semantic and instance segmentation
models to provide external information, and exploit language embeddings to
encode relational information between classes. We also provide a prior on the
average real-world size of objects. This external information overcomes the
limitation in data availability, and ensures that the limited capacity of a
given network is focused on known-helpful cues, therefore improving
performance. We experimentally validate our hypothesis and evaluate the
proposed model on the widely used NYUD2 indoor depth estimation benchmark. The
results show improvements in depth prediction when the semantic information,
size prior and instance size are explicitly provided along with the RGB images,

technology scaling, which negatively impacts reliability by exacerbating
various circuit-level error mechanisms. To compensate for growing error rates,
both memory manufacturers and consumers use error-mitigation mechanisms that
improve manufacturing yield and allow system designers to meet reliability
targets. Developing effective error mitigations requires understanding the
errors' characteristics (e.g., worst-case behavior, statistical properties).
Unfortunately, we observe that proprietary on-die Error-Correcting Codes (ECC)
used in modern memory chips introduce new challenges to efficient error
mitigation by obfuscating CPU-visible error characteristics in an
unpredictable, ECC-dependent manner.
  This dissertation builds a detailed understanding of how on-die ECC
obfuscates the statistical properties of main memory error mechanisms using a
combination of real-chip experiments and statistical analyses. We
experimentally study memory errors, examine how on-die ECC obfuscates their
statistical characteristics, and develop new testing techniques to overcome the
obfuscation. Our results show that the obfuscated error characteristics can be
recovered using new memory testing techniques that exploit the interaction
between on-die ECC and the statistical characteristics of memory error
mechanisms to expose physical cell behavior. We conclude by discussing the
critical need for transparency in DRAM reliability characteristics in order to
enable DRAM consumers to better understand and adapt commodity DRAM chips to
their system-specific needs. We hope and believe that the analysis, techniques,

SoftEdge, which assigns random weights to a portion of the edges of a given

an example we present an analysis of clustering measured by the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey in combination with CMB lensing measured by

Using only the redshift space data we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.303\pm
0.008$, $H_0 = 69.21\pm 0.78$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.743\pm 0.043$. The addition of

constraints. The combination of $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ are consistent with
Planck, though their constraints derive mostly from redshift-space clustering.
The low $\sigma_8$ value are driven by cross correlations with CMB lensing in
the low redshift bin ($z\simeq 0.38$) and at large angular scales, which show a
$20\%$ deficit compared to expectations from galaxy clustering alone. We

on supernova dynamics by performing 97 simulations for solar- and
zero-metallicity progenitors in the range of $14\texttt{-}100\,\text{M}_\odot$.
We find explosions only for two low-compactness models ($14 \text{M}_\odot$ and
$16\,\text{M}_\odot$) with the DD2F\_SF EoS, both with low explosion energies
of $\mathord{\sim}10^{50}\,\mathrm{erg}$. These weak explosions are
characterised by a neutrino signal with several mini-bursts in the explosion
phase due to complex reverse shock dynamics, in addition to the typical second
neutrino burst for phase-transition driven explosions. The nucleosynthesis
shows significant overproduction of nuclei such as $^{90}\mathrm{Zr}$ for the
$14\,\text{M}_\odot$ zero-metallicity model and $^{94}\mathrm{Zr}$ for the
$16\,\text{M}_\odot$ solar-metallicity model, but the overproduction factors
are not large enough to place constraints on the occurrence of such explosions.
Several other low-compactness models using the DD2F\_SF EoS and two
high-compactness models using the STOS EoS end up as failed explosions and emit
a second neutrino burst. For the CMF EoS, the phase transition never leads to a
second bounce and explosion. For all three EoS, inverted convection occurs deep
in the core of the proto-compact star due to anomalous behaviour of
thermodynamic derivatives in the mixed phase, which heats the core to entropies
up to $4k_\text{B}/\text{baryon}$ and may have a distinctive gravitational wave
signature, also for a second-order phase transition.

enabling inference about the missing volatility data conditional on the
observed data by an approximate Gibbs sampling approach. Imputed estimates of
missing quotes can afterwards be used to fit a standard stochastic volatility
model. Since training data for the employed variational autoencoder model is
usually sparsely available, we test the robustness of the approach for a model
trained on synthetic data on real market quotes and we show that SABR
interpolated volatilites calibrated to reconstructed volatility cubes with
artificially imputed missing values differ by not much more than two basis

Two common formulations of the problem include: Minimum Vertex Cover, which
finds the smallest vertex cover in a graph, and Parameterized Vertex Cover,
which finds a vertex cover whose size is less than or equal to some parameter
$k$. Algorithms for both formulations traverse a search tree, which grows
exponentially with the size of the graph or the value of $k$.
  Parallelizing the traversal of the vertex cover search tree on GPUs is
challenging for multiple reasons. First, the search tree is a narrow binary
tree which makes it difficult to extract enough sub-trees to process in
parallel to fully utilize the GPU's resources. Second, the search tree is
highly imbalanced which makes load balancing across a massive number of
parallel GPU workers challenging. Third, keeping around all the intermediate
state needed to traverse many sub-trees in parallel puts high pressure on the
GPU's memory resources and may act as a limiting factor to parallelism.
  To address these challenges, we propose an approach to traverse the vertex
cover search tree in parallel using GPUs while handling dynamic load balancing.
Each thread block traverses a different sub-tree using a local stack, however,
we also use a global worklist to balance load. Blocks contribute branches of
their sub-trees to the global worklist on an as-needed basis, while blocks that
finish their sub-trees get new ones from the global worklist. We use degree
arrays to represent intermediate graphs so that the representation is compact
in memory to avoid limiting parallelism, but self-contained which is necessary
for load balancing. Our evaluation shows that compared to prior work, our
hybrid approach of using local stacks and a global worklist substantially
improves performance and reduces load imbalance, especially on difficult

of external H-bonds (with $\mathrm{H_2O}$ molecules or lipid headgroups) to

transport timescales, however, are often too long to capture accurately using
conventional molecular dynamics (\textsc{Md}). Recently, path sampling
techniques such as forward-flux sampling (\textsc{Ffs}) have emerged as
attractive alternatives for efficiently and accurately estimating arbitrarily
long ionic passage times. Here, we use non-equilibrium \textsc{Md} and
\textsc{Ffs} to explore how the kinetics and mechanism of pressure-driven
chloride transport through a nanoporous graphitic membrane are affected by its
lateral dimensions. We not only find ionic passage times and free energy
barriers to decrease dramatically upon increasing the membrane surface area,
but also observe an abrupt and discontinuous change in the locus of the
transition state. These strong finite size effects arise due to the cumulative
effect of the periodic images of the leading ion entering the pore on the
distribution of the induced excess charge at the membrane surface in the feed.
By assuming that the feed is an ideal conductor, we analytically derive a
finite size correction term that can be computed from the information obtained
from a single simulation and successfully use it to obtain corrected free
energy profiles with no dependence on system size. We then estimate ionic
passage times in the thermodynamic limit by assuming an Eyring-type dependence
of rates on barriers with a size-independent prefactor. This approach
constitutes a universal framework for removing finite size artifacts in
molecular simulations of ion transport through nanoporous membranes and
biological channel proteins.

data abstraction. That is, how to organize data with associated operations.
There are important tradeoffs between functional and object-oriented

programmers are usually forced to select a particular decomposition style in
the early stage of programming. Once the wrong design decision has been made,
the price for switching to the other decomposition style could be rather high

dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds. The manifolds need not be
characterized by an a priori known atlas or by the zeros of a smooth map.
Instead, they can be defined by point-clouds and sampled as needed through an
iterative process. If the manifold is an Euclidean space, our method follows
isoclines, curves along which the direction of the vector field $X$ is
constant. For a generic vector field $X$, isoclines are smooth curves and every
equilibrium lies on isoclines. We generalize the definition of isoclines to
Riemannian manifolds through the use of parallel transport: generalized
isoclines are curves along which the directions of $X$ are parallel transports
of each other. As in the Euclidean case, generalized isoclines of generic
vector fields $X$ are smooth curves that connect equilibria of $X$. Our
algorithm can be regarded as an extension of the method of Newton trajectories
to the manifold setting when the manifold is unknown.
  This work is motivated by computational statistical mechanics, specifically
high dimensional (stochastic) differential equations that model the dynamics of
molecular systems. Often, these dynamics concentrate near low-dimensional
manifolds and have transitions (saddle points with a single unstable direction)
between metastable equilibria. We employ iteratively sampled data and isoclines
to locate these saddle points. Coupling a black-box sampling scheme (e.g.,
Markov chain Monte Carlo) with manifold learning techniques (diffusion maps in
the case presented here), we show that our method reliably locates equilibria
of $X$.

which realistic features of disk galaxies (warps, bars, spiral arms, and other
substructure) inject noise or bias into such shear measurements, we fit an
idealized disk model, including shear, to unsheared galaxies in the Illustris

unmodeled galaxy features inject noise and bias. We find that $\gamma_+$, the
component of shear parallel to the galaxy's first principal axis, is highly
biased and noisy because disks violate the assumption of face-on circularity,
displaying a range of intrinsic axis ratios ($0.85\pm0.11$). The other shear

extending previous M dwarf flare studies into the ultra-cool regime, we find
M5-M7 stars are more likely to flare than both earlier, and later, M dwarfs. By
performing artificial flare injection-recovery tests we demonstrate that we can
detect a significant proportion of flares down to an amplitude of 1 per cent,
and we are most sensitive to flares on the coolest stars. Our results reveal an
absence of high-energy flares on the reddest dwarfs. To probe the relations
between rotation and activity for fully convective stars, we extract rotation
periods for fast rotators and lower-bound period estimates of slow rotators.
These rotation periods span from 2.2 hours to 65 days, and we find that the
proportion of flaring stars increases for the very fastest rotators. Finally,
we discuss the impact of our flare sample on planets orbiting ultra-cool stars.
As stars become cooler, they flare less frequently; therefore, it is unlikely
that planets around the very reddest dwarfs would enter the `abiogenesis' zone

when dealing with images. However, in many application areas (e.g., robotics),

staying safely at home. While meeting others is pleasant, it also increases the
risk of infection. We consider this dilemma by introducing a game-theoretic
network creation model in which selfish agents can form bilateral connections.
They benefit from network neighbors, but at the same time, they want to
maximize their distance to all other agents. This models the inherent conflict
that social distancing rules impose on the behavior of selfish agents in a
social network. Besides addressing this familiar issue, our model can be seen
as the inverse to the well-studied Network Creation Game by Fabrikant et al.
[PODC 2003] where agents aim at being as central as possible in the created
network. Thus, our work is in-line with studies that compare minimization
problems with their maximization versions.
  We look at two variants of network creation governed by social distancing. In
the first variant, there are no restrictions on the connections being formed.
We characterize optimal and equilibrium networks, and we derive asymptotically
tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The second variant
is the model's generalization that allows restrictions on the connections that
can be formed. As our main result, we prove that Swap-Maximal Routing-Cost
Spanning Trees, an efficiently computable weaker variant of Maximum
Routing-Cost Spanning Trees, actually resemble equilibria for a significant
range of the parameter space. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds on the
Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. These results imply that, compared the
well-studied inverse models, under social distancing the agents' selfish
behavior has a significantly stronger impact on the quality of the equilibria,
i.e., allowing socially much worse stable states.

the $( \textbf{x}_i)_{i \leq n}$ are i.i.d.~random covariates in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. In the linear high-dimensional regime $n \asymp d$, it was
shown that these matrices are well approximated by their linearization, which
simplifies into the sum of a rescaled Wishart matrix and identity matrix. In
this paper, we generalize this decomposition to the polynomial high-dimensional
regime $n \asymp d^\ell,\ell \in \mathbb{N}$, for data uniformly distributed on
the sphere and hypercube. In this regime, the kernel matrix is well
approximated by its degree-$\ell$ polynomial approximation and can be
decomposed into a low-rank spike matrix, identity and a `Gegenbauer matrix'
with entries $Q_\ell (\langle \textbf{x}_i , \textbf{x}_j \rangle)$, where
$Q_\ell$ is the degree-$\ell$ Gegenbauer polynomial. We show that the spectrum
of the Gegenbauer matrix converges in distribution to a Marchenko-Pastur law.
  This problem is motivated by the study of the prediction error of kernel
ridge regression (KRR) in the polynomial regime $n \asymp d^\kappa, \kappa >0$.
Previous work showed that for $\kappa \not\in \mathbb{N}$, KRR fits exactly a
degree-$\lfloor \kappa \rfloor$ polynomial approximation to the target
function. In this paper, we use our characterization of the kernel matrix to
complete this picture and compute the precise asymptotics of the test error in
the limit $n/d^\kappa \to \psi$ with $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$. In this case, the
test error can present a double descent behavior, depending on the effective
regularization and signal-to-noise ratio at level $\kappa$. Because this double
descent can occur each time $\kappa$ crosses an integer, this explains the
multiple descent phenomenon in the KRR risk curve observed in several previous
works.

scene to reconstruct high-resolution images. We can characterize resolution by
modeling CSAS imaging as the convolution between a scene's underlying point
scattering distribution and a system-dependent point spread function (PSF). The
PSF is a function of the transmitted waveform's bandwidth and determines a
fixed degree of blurring on reconstructed imagery. In theory, deconvolution
overcomes bandwidth limitations by reversing the PSF-induced blur and
recovering the scene's scattering distribution. However, deconvolution is an
ill-posed inverse problem and sensitive to noise. We propose a self-supervised
pipeline (does not require training data) that leverages an implicit neural
representation (INR) for deconvolving CSAS images. We highlight the performance
of our SAS INR pipeline, which we call SINR, by implementing and comparing to
existing deconvolution methods. Additionally, prior SAS deconvolution methods
assume a spatially-invariant PSF, which we demonstrate yields subpar
performance in practice. We provide theory and methods to account for a
spatially-varying CSAS PSF, and demonstrate that doing so enables SINR to
achieve superior deconvolution performance on simulated and real acoustic SAS
data. We provide code to encourage reproducibility of research.

wireless networks. Despite significant recent efforts in this area, most prior
works are focused on specific data types (e.g., image or audio), and they
ignore the goal and effectiveness aspects of semantic transmissions. In
contrast, in this paper, a holistic goal-oriented semantic communication
framework is proposed to enable a speaker and a listener to cooperatively
execute a set of sequential tasks in a dynamic environment. A common language
based on a hierarchical belief set is proposed to enable semantic
communications between speaker and listener. The speaker, acting as an observer
of the environment, utilizes the beliefs to transmit an initial description of
its observation (called event) to the listener. The listener is then able to
infer on the transmitted description and complete it by adding related beliefs
to the transmitted beliefs of the speaker. As such, the listener reconstructs
the observed event based on the completed description, and it then takes
appropriate action in the environment based on the reconstructed event. An
optimization problem is defined to determine the perfect and abstract
description of the events while minimizing the transmission and inference costs
with constraints on the task execution time and belief efficiency. Then, a
novel bottom-up curriculum learning (CL) framework based on reinforcement
learning is proposed to solve the optimization problem and enable the speaker
and listener to gradually identify the structure of the belief set and the
perfect and abstract description of the events. Simulation results show that
the proposed CL method outperforms traditional RL in terms of convergence time,
task execution cost and time, reliability, and belief efficiency.

Gaussian interactions between two classical many-body systems trapped in
external harmonic potentials. Previous work showed an approximate, power-law
scaling of the interaction energy with the number of particles, with particular
focus on the dependence of the anomalous exponent on the interaction strength.
Here we explore the role of the interaction range in determining anomalous
exponents, showing that it is a more relevant parameter to differentiate
distinct regimes of responses of the system. More specifically, on varying the
interaction range from its largest values while keeping the interaction
strength constant, we observe a crossover from an integrable system,
approximating the Caldeira-Leggett interaction term in the long range limit, to
an intermediate interaction range in which the system manifests anomalous
scaling, and finally to a regime of local interactions in which anomalous
scaling disappears. A Fourier analysis of the interaction energy shows that
nonlinearities give rise to an effective bath with a broad band of frequencies,
even when starting with only two distinct trapping frequencies, yielding
efficient thermalization in the intermediate regime of interaction range. We
provide qualitative arguments, based on an analogous Fourier analysis of the
standard map, supporting the view that anomalous scaling and features of the
Fourier spectrum may be used as proxies to identify the role of chaotic
dynamics. Our work, that encompasses models developed in different contexts and
unifies them in a common framework, may be relevant to the general
understanding of the role of nonlinearities in a variety of many-body classical

liquid into conical capillaries are studied to assess the feasibility of a
conical liquid diode. The analytical formulas for the Laplace pressure and the
critical Young's contact angle of the capillary for the onset of spontaneous
imbibition are derived using the classical capillary model of thermodynamics.
The critical contact angle below which the spontaneous imbibition can occur
belongs to the hydrophilic region for the capillary with a diverging radius
while it belongs to the hydrophobic region for the capillary with a converging
radius. Thus, by choosing Young's contact angle between these two critical
contact angles, only the spontaneous imbibition toward the converging radius
occurs. Therefore, the capillary with a converging radius acts as the forward
direction and that with a diverging radius as the reverse direction of diode.
Even under the external applied pressure, the free-energy landscape implies
that the forced imbibition occurs only to the forward direction by tuning the
applied pressure. Furthermore, the scaling rule of the time scale of imbibition
is derived by assuming Hagen-Poiseuille steady flow. Again, the time scale of
the forward direction is advantageous compared to the reverse direction when
the imbibition to both direction is possible. Therefore, our theoretical
analysis shows that a conical capillary acts as a liquid diode.

(e.g., a power limit), but doing so often conflicts with their ability to

learning to automatically tune hardware resources such that the system
execution meets safety constraints optimally. Such solutions monitor past
system executions to learn the system's behavior under different hardware
resource allocations before dynamically tuning resources to optimize the
application execution. However, system behavior can change significantly
between different applications and even different inputs of the same
applications. Hence, the models learned using data collected a priori are often
suboptimal and violate safety constraints when used with new applications and
inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of an execution
space, which is the cross product of hardware resources, input features, and
applications. To dynamically and safely allocate hardware resources from the
execution space, we present SCOPE, a resource manager that leverages a novel
safe exploration framework. We evaluate SCOPE's ability to deliver improved
latency while minimizing power constraint violations by dynamically configuring
hardware while running a variety of Apache Spark applications. Compared to
prior approaches that minimize power constraint violations, SCOPE consumes
comparable power while improving latency by up to 9.5X. Compared to prior

garbage collection time and memory usage. However, there's a trade-off: a lower
heap limit reduces memory use but increases garbage collection time. Classic
methods for setting heap limits include manually tuned heap limits and
multiple-of-live-size rules of thumb, but it is not clear when one rule is
better than another or how to compare them.
  We address this problem with a new framework where heap limits are set for
multiple heaps at once. Our key insight is that every heap limit rule induces a
particular allocation of memory across multiple processes, and this allocation
can be sub-optimal. We use our framework to derive an optimal ""square-root""
heap limit rule, which minimizes total memory usage for any amount of total
garbage collection time. Paradoxically, the square-root heap limit rule
achieves this coordination without communication: it allocates memory optimally
across multiple heaps without requiring any communication between those heaps.
  To demonstrate that this heap limit rule is effective, we prototype it for
V8, the JavaScript runtime used in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other
browsers, as well as in server-side frameworks like node.js and Deno. On
real-world web pages, our prototype achieves reductions of approximately 16.0%

The SWLE exhibits a limited sensitivity to the outliers, theoretically
justifying its robustness against model contaminations. Also, with the
specially designed weight function to effectively diminish the contributions of
extreme losses to the GLM parameter estimations, most statistical quantities
can still be derived analytically, minimizing the computational burden for
parameter calibrations. Apart from robust estimations, the SWLE can also act as
a quantitative diagnostic tool to detect outliers and systematic model
misspecifications. Motivated by the coverage modifications which make insurance
losses often random censored and truncated, the SWLE is extended to accommodate
censored and truncated data. We exemplify the SWLE on three simulation studies

produces more reliable parameter estimates than the MLE if outliers contaminate
the dataset. The SWLE diagnostic tool also successfully detects any systematic
model misspecifications with high power, accompanying some potential model

tasks remains a big challenge. Basically, there are two main methods for SLU
tasks: (1) Two-stage method, which uses a speech model to transfer speech to
text, then uses a language model to get the results of downstream tasks; (2)
One-stage method, which just fine-tunes a pre-trained speech model to fit in
the downstream tasks. The first method loses emotional cues such as intonation,
and causes recognition errors during ASR process, and the second one lacks
necessary language knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Wave BERT (WaBERT),
a novel end-to-end model combining the speech model and the language model for
SLU tasks. WaBERT is based on the pre-trained speech and language model, hence
training from scratch is not needed. We also set most parameters of WaBERT
frozen during training. By introducing WaBERT, audio-specific information and
language knowledge are integrated in the short-time and low-resource training

  Hardness of approximation: Are there distance oracles with $m^{1+o(1)}$

super-constant approximation factors, while only $3-\epsilon$ factors were

approximately doubles accuracy on bias-prone sentences for human-labeled
COVID-19 social media data, without adversely affecting the classifier's
overall F1 score. Despite being a fully unsupervised approach, neural
contrastive clustering achieves a larger improvement in accuracy on bias-prone
sentences than a supervised masking approach.
  Conclusions: Neural contrastive clustering reduces correlation bias in
sentiment text classification. Further research is needed to explore
generalizing this technique to other neural network architectures and
application domains.

exploitation and manipulation of exotic interacting quantum states. Here, we
present a controllable route to construct easily tunable flat bands in folded
graphene, by nano origami-controlled strain engineering, and discover
correlated states in this system. Via tearing and folding graphene monolayer at
arbitrary step edges with scanning tunneling microscope manipulation, we create
strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields as well as resulting flat electronic
bands in the curved edges of folded graphene. We show that the intensity of the
pseudo-magnetic field can be readily tuned by changing the width of the folding
edge due to the edge-width-dependent lattice deformation, leading to the well
adjustability of the geometry of flat bands in folded graphene. Furthermore, by
creating expected dispersionless flat bands using this technique, the
correlation-induced splits of flat bands are successfully observed in the
density of states when these bands are partially filled. Our experiment
provides a feasible and effective pathway to engineer the system with tunable
flat band structures, and establishes a new platform that can be used to
realize devisable strain and interaction induced quantum phases.

an indivisible item to $n$ buyers such that the buyers' valuations are drawn
from a joint distribution that is unknown to both the buyers and the seller;
buyers do not need to form beliefs about competitors, and the seller assumes
the distribution is adversarially chosen from a specified class. We measure
performance through the worst-case regret, or the difference between the
expected revenue achievable with perfect knowledge of buyers' valuations and
the actual mechanism revenue.
  We study a broad set of classes of valuation distributions that capture a
wide spectrum of possible dependencies: independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) distributions, mixtures of i.i.d. distributions, affiliated and
exchangeable distributions, exchangeable distributions, and all joint
distributions. We derive in quasi closed form the minimax values and the
associated optimal mechanism. In particular, we show that the first three

freely as we record the brain's magnetic field is a hot topic in recent years.
Traditionally, atomic magnetometers are utilized for moving MEGs recording and
a large compensation coil system is utilized for background magnetic field
compensation. Here we described a new potential candidate: an optically pumped
atomic co-magnetometer(OPACM) for moving MEGs recording. In the OPACM,
hyper-polarized nuclear spins could produce a magnetic field which will shield
the background fluctuation low frequency magnetic field noise while the the
fast changing MEGs signal could be recorded. The nuclear spins look like an
automatic magnetic field shields and dynamically compensate the fluctuated
background magnetic field noise. In this article, the magnetic field
compensation is studied theoretically and we find that the compensation is
closely related to several parameters such as the electron spin magnetic field,
the nuclear spin magnetic field and the holding magnetic field. Based on the
model, the magnetic field compensation could be optimized. We also
experimentally studied the magnetic field compensation and the responses of the
OPACM to different frequencies of magnetic field are measured. We show that the
OPACM owns a clear suppression of low frequency magnetic field under 1Hz and
response to magnetic field's frequencies around the band of the MEGs. Magnetic
field sensitivity of $3fT/Hz^{1/2}$ has been achieved. Finally, we do a
simulation for the OPACM as it is utilized for moving MEGs recording. For
comparison, the traditional compensation system for moving MEGs recording is
based on a coil which is around 2m in dimension while our compensation system
is only 2mm in dimension. Moreover, our compensation system could work in situ

carefully curated vision-language datasets. While these datasets reach an order
of 10 million samples, the labor cost is prohibitive to scale further.
Conversely, unimodal encoders are pretrained with simpler annotations that are
less cost-prohibitive, achieving scales of hundreds of millions to billions. As
a result, unimodal encoders have achieved state-of-art (SOTA) on many
downstream tasks. However, challenges remain when applying to VL tasks. The
pretraining data is not optimal for cross-modal architectures and requires
heavy computational resources. In addition, unimodal architectures lack
cross-modal interactions that have demonstrated significant benefits for VL
tasks. Therefore, how to best leverage pretrained unimodal encoders for VL
tasks is still an area of active research. In this work, we propose a method to
leverage unimodal vision and text encoders for VL tasks that augment existing
VL approaches while conserving computational complexity. Specifically, we
propose Multimodal Adaptive Distillation (MAD), which adaptively distills
useful knowledge from pretrained encoders to cross-modal VL encoders. Second,
to better capture nuanced impacts on VL task performance, we introduce an
evaluation protocol that includes Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Visual
Entailment (SNLI-VE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), across a variety of
data constraints and conditions of domain shift. Experiments demonstrate that
MAD leads to consistent gains in the low-shot, domain-shifted, and
fully-supervised conditions on VCR, SNLI-VE, and VQA, achieving SOTA
performance on VCR compared to other single models pretrained with image-text

real-time robotic applications. We address this issue by employing a novel {\it
domain-invariant} NBV planner. A standard VPR subsystem based on a
convolutional neural network (CNN) is assumed to be available, and its
domain-invariant state recognition ability is proposed to be transferred to
train the domain-invariant NBV planner. Specifically, we divide the visual cues
that are available from the CNN model into two types: the output layer cue
(OLC) and intermediate layer cue (ILC). The OLC is available at the output
layer of the CNN model and aims to estimate the state of the robot (e.g., the
robot viewpoint) with respect to the world-centric view coordinate system. The
ILC is available within the middle layers of the CNN model as a high-level
description of the visual content (e.g., a saliency image) with respect to the
ego-centric view. In our framework, the ILC and OLC are mapped to a state
vector and subsequently used to train a multiview NBV planner via deep
reinforcement learning. Experiments using the public NCLT dataset validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

caring for the elderly, mental health support, and customer service chats. This
paper presents a novel task of empathetic dialog generation with positive
emotion elicitation to promote users' positive emotions, similar to that of
emotional support between humans. In this task, the agent conducts empathetic
responses along with the target of eliciting the user's positive emotions in
the multi-turn dialog. To facilitate the study of this task, we collect a
large-scale emotional dialog dataset with positive emotion elicitation, called
PosEmoDial (about 820k dialogs, 3M utterances). In these dialogs, the agent
tries to guide the user from any possible initial emotional state, e.g.,
sadness, to a positive emotional state. Then we present a
positive-emotion-guided dialog generation model with a novel loss function
design. This loss function encourages the dialog model to not only elicit
positive emotions from users but also ensure smooth emotional transitions along
with the whole dialog. Finally, we establish benchmark results on PosEmoDial,
and we will release this dataset and related source code to facilitate future
studies.

functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function technique, we first
perform a study on the electron band structure of armchair C$_3$N nanoribbons

the pristine AC$_3$NNRs are metal, while the H-passivated ones are either

atomic configurations. Then we propose a lateral planar homogenous junction
with an interface between the pristine and H-passivated AC$_3$NNRs, in which
forms a Schottky-like barrier. Interestingly, our further transport calculation
demonstrates that this AC$_3$NNRs-based heterojunction exhibits a good
rectification behavior. In specification, the average rectification ratio (RR)
can reach up to $10^3$ in the bias regime from 0.2 to 0.4 V. Particularly,
extending the length of semiconductor part in the heterojunction leads to the
decrease of the current through the junction, but the RR can be enlarged
obviously. The average RR increases to the order of $10^4$ in the bias from
0.25 to 0.40 V, with the boosted maximum up to $10^5$ at 0.35 V. The findings

the similarity of speaker embeddings extracted from a neural network model. The
commonly used back-end models are the cosine scoring and the probabilistic
linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) scoring. With the recently developed neural
embeddings, the theoretically more appealing PLDA approach is found to have no
advantage against or even be inferior the simple cosine scoring in terms of SV
system performance. This paper presents an investigation on the relation
between the two scoring approaches, aiming to explain the above
counter-intuitive observation. It is shown that the cosine scoring is
essentially a special case of PLDA scoring. In other words, by properly setting
the parameters of PLDA, the two back-ends become equivalent. As a consequence,
the cosine scoring not only inherits the basic assumptions for the PLDA but
also introduces additional assumptions on the properties of input embeddings.
Experiments show that the dimensional independence assumption required by the
cosine scoring contributes most to the performance gap between the two methods
under the domain-matched condition. When there is severe domain mismatch and
the dimensional independence assumption does not hold, the PLDA would perform
better than the cosine for domain adaptation.

($\lambda_{\textrm{ex}}^\textrm{A}$ and $\lambda_{\textrm{ex}}^\textrm{B}$)
from the low-energy Dirac bands of the proximitized graphene. Depending on the
magnetic phase of the MPX$_3$ layer (ferromagnetic and three antiferromagnetic
ones), completely different Dirac dispersions can be realized with exchange
splittings ranging from 0 to 10~meV. Surprisingly, not only the magnitude of
the exchange couplings depends on the magnetic phase, but also the global sign

Dirac bands. More specifically, decreasing the interlayer distance by only
about 10\%, a giant 5-fold enhancement of proximity exchange is found, while
applying few V/nm of electric field, provides tunability of proximity exchange
by tens of percent. We have also studied the dependence on the Hubbard $U$

it has the potential to greatly reduce the reliance on large amounts of

detection literature primarily focuses on bounding box classification by
obtaining as discriminative feature embeddings as possible, we emphasize the
necessity of handling the lack of intersection-over-union (IoU) variations
induced by a biased distribution of novel samples. In this paper, we analyze
the IoU imbalance that is caused by the relatively high number of low-quality
region proposals, and reveal that it plays a critical role in improving
few-shot learning capabilities. The well-known two stage fine-tuning technique
causes insufficient quality and quantity of the novel positive samples, which
hinders the effective object detection of unseen novel classes. To alleviate
this issue, we present a few-shot object detection model with proposal balance
refinement, a simple yet effective approach in learning object proposals using
an auxiliary sequential bounding box refinement process. This process enables
the detector to be optimized on the various IoU scores through additional novel
class samples. To fully exploit our sequential stage architecture, we revise
the fine-tuning strategy and expose the Region Proposal Network to the novel
classes in order to provide increased learning opportunities for the
region-of-interest (RoI) classifiers and regressors. Our extensive assessments

behaviors of neural networks (NNs). However, little work has been done to
extract the potential hidden semantics (mathematical representation) of a
neural network. A succinct and explicit mathematical representation of a NN
model could improve the understanding and interpretation of its behaviors. To
address this need, we propose a novel symbolic regression method for neural
works (called SRNet) to discover the mathematical expressions of a NN. SRNet
creates a Cartesian genetic programming (NNCGP) to represent the hidden
semantics of a single layer in a NN. It then leverages a multi-chromosome NNCGP
to represent hidden semantics of all layers of the NN. The method uses a
(1+$\lambda$) evolutionary strategy (called MNNCGP-ES) to extract the final
mathematical expressions of all layers in the NN. Experiments on 12 symbolic
regression benchmarks and 5 classification benchmarks show that SRNet not only
can reveal the complex relationships between each layer of a NN but also can
extract the mathematical representation of the whole NN. Compared with LIME and
MAPLE, SRNet has higher interpolation accuracy and trends to approximate the
real model on the practical dataset.

turbulent boundary layer at Mach number 2.28 is carried out at moderate
Reynolds number, simulating flow conditions similar to those of the experiment
by Dupont et al. (2006). The low-frequency shock unsteadiness, whose
characteristics have been the focus of considerable research efforts, is here
investigated via the Morlet wavelet transform. Owing to its compact support in
both physical and Fourier spaces, the wavelet transformation makes it possible
to track the time evolution of the various scales of the wall-pressure
fluctuations. This property also makes it possible to define a local
intermittency measure, representing a frequency-dependent flatness factor, to
pinpoint the bursts of energy that characterise the shock intermittency scale
by scale. As a major result, wavelet decomposition shows that the broadband
shock movement is actually the result of a collection of sparse events in time,
each characterised by its own temporal scale. This feature is hidden by the
classical Fourier analysis, which can only show the time-averaged behaviour.
Then, we propose a procedure to process any relevant time series, such as the
time history of the wall-pressure or that of the separation bubble extent, in
which we use a condition based on the local intermittency measure to filter out
the turbulent content in the proximity of the shock foot and to isolate only
the intermittent component of the signal. In addition, wavelet analysis reveals
the intermittent behaviour also of the breathing motion of the recirculation
bubble behind the reflected shock, and allows us to detect a direct, partial
correspondence between the most significant intermittent events of the
separation region and those of the wall-pressure at the foot of the shock.

evolves candidates by iterating this subroutine a large number of times. Neural

unprecedented success in external generalization. FIN architecture is based on
spatial Fourier transform modules that process the spatial frequencies of its

existing convolutional deep neural networks used for hologram reconstruction,
FIN exhibits superior generalization to new types of samples, while also being
much faster in its image inference speed, completing the hologram
reconstruction task in ~0.04 s per 1 mm^2 of the sample area. We experimentally
validated the performance of FIN by training it using human lung tissue samples
and blindly testing it on human prostate, salivary gland tissue and Pap smear
samples, proving its superior external generalization and image reconstruction

the underlying neural network architecture might open up various new

reveal that the intermediate layers' representational shift (IRS) also matters
since it disrupts batch normalization, which is another crucial cause of

Hierarchical fine-tuning leverages a multi-stage strategy to fine-tune the

alleviating IRS. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method

temperature sharply increases from 7.7 GeV to 14.5 GeV and then remain static
from 14.5-39 GeV, and this consistency may disclose that the onset energy of
the phase transition of partial deconfinement and the whole deconfinement are
14.5 and 39 GeV respectively. The kinetic freeze-out volume and mean transverse
momentum grows with the rise of collision energy. Furthermore, the different
extracted temperatures are observed in the order of time evolution of the
interacting system, and they (as well as kinetic freeze-out volume) have an
increasing trend from peripheral to central collisions. We also observed the
mass dependence of the effective temperature and kinetic freeze-out volume
where former increases while the later decreases for heavier particles, which
indicates the early freeze-out of the heavier particles.

conversation response ranking has lead to a great deal of attention to building
neural re-rankers, while the first-stage retrieval step has been overlooked.
Since the correct answer is always available in the candidate list of $n$

retrieval step which is always able to rank the correct response in its top-$n$
list. In this paper we focus on the more realistic task of full-rank retrieval

the best performing method overall to be dense retrieval with intermediate

representations are learned, followed by fine-tuning on the target
conversational data. We also investigate the intriguing phenomena that harder

computational times lend simulations a critical advantage over numerical

that relies on the confinement of field-emission resonances, a class of
vacuum-localized discretized electronic states. We use atom manipulation of
surface vacancies in a chlorine-terminated Cu(100) surface to reveal square
patches of the underlying metal, thereby creating atomically-precise potential
wells that host particle-in-a-box modes. By adjusting the shape and size of the
confining potential, we can access states with different quantum numbers,
making these patches attractive candidates as quantum dots or artificial atoms.
We demonstrate that the lifetime of electrons in these engineered states can be
extended and tuned through modification of the confining potential, either via
atomic assembly or by changing the tip-sample distance. We also demonstrate
control over a finite range of state-filling, a parameter which plays a key
role in the evolution of quantum many-body states. We model the transport
through the localized state to disentangle and quantify the lifetime-limiting
processes, illustrating the critical dependency of the electron lifetime on the
properties of the underlying bulk band structure. The interplay with the bulk
bands also gives rise to negative differential resistance, opening possible
avenues for engineering custom atomic-scale resonant tunnelling diodes, which
exhibit similar current-voltage characteristics.

training), and cannot ensure the same model convergence and accuracy
performance as without pipelining. Synchronous pipelining has recently been
proposed which ensures model performance by enforcing a synchronization barrier
between training iterations. Nonetheless, the synchronization barrier requires
waiting for gradient aggregation from all microbatches and thus delays the
training progress. Optimized pipeline planning is needed to minimize such wait
and hence the training time, which has not been well studied in the literature.
This paper designs efficient, near-optimal algorithms for expediting
synchronous pipeline-parallel training of modern large DNNs over arbitrary

decides processing order of microbatches over the partitions, which together
minimize the per-iteration training time. We conduct thorough theoretical

an essential part of the Venera-D project aimed to explore the planet using a

land at any point on the surface of Venus because of the short duration of the
launch window (about 2 weeks from the optimal launch date), as well as
restrictions on the maximum permissible overload. An additional factor
affecting the reduction of attainable landing sites is the low angular velocity
of Venus own rotation. This study proposes a new approach to expand the
attainable landing areas. The approach is based on the use of the gravitational
field of Venus to transfer the spacecraft to an orbit resonant to the Venusian
one with a ratio of periods of 1:1. All the simulations were performed at the
patched conic approximation. As an example, we considered a flight to Venus at
launch in 2029 or 2031. For both cases maps of attainable landing areas on the
surface were constructed. It has been demonstrated that there is always at
least one launch date within the launch window, allowing the spacecraft to
reach almost any point on the surface of Venus. It is shown that the
application of the proposed approach makes it possible to achieve a significant
expansion of the attainable landing areas (over 70\% of the surface) and, in
some cases, provide access to any point on the surface of Venus. However, the
price of this advantage is an increase in the flight duration by one Venusian

them ideal candidates for future magnonic devices operating at THz frequencies.
A major focus of current research is the investigation of optical methods for
the efficient generation of coherent magnons in antiferromagnetic insulators.
In magnetic lattices endowed with orbital angular momentum, spin-orbit coupling
enables spin dynamics through the resonant excitation of low-energy electric
dipoles such as phonons and orbital resonances which interact with spins.
However, in magnetic systems with zero orbital angular momentum, microscopic
pathways for the resonant and low-energy optical excitation of coherent spin
dynamics are lacking. Here, we consider experimentally the relative merits of
electronic and vibrational excitations for the optical control of zero orbital
angular momentum magnets, focusing on a limit case: the antiferromagnet
manganese thiophoshate (MnPS3), constituted by orbital singlet Mn2+ ions. We
study the correlation of spins with two types of excitations within its band
gap: a bound electron orbital excitation from the singlet orbital ground state
of Mn2+ into an orbital triplet state, which causes coherent spin precession,
and a vibrational excitation of the crystal field that causes thermal spin
disorder. Our findings cast orbital transitions as key targets for magnetic
control in insulators constituted by magnetic centers of zero orbital angular

NVSS, the Apertif imaging survey, and the FIRST (1.4 GHz), the VLASS (3 GHz),
and in public LOFAR (130-170 MHz), WISE (3.4-22 $\mu$m), and SDSS (z, i, r, g,
u filters) data. The luminosity inferred at 1.4 GHz is
(5.1$\pm0.2)\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. To characterise the emission
and distinguish between different components within the galaxy, we performed
dedicated, high-sensitivity and high-resolution observations with the European
VLBI Network + e-MERLIN at 1.6 and 5 GHz. We did not detect any emission from a
compact core, suggesting that the presence of a radio-loud AGN is unlikely, and
therefore we ascribe the emission observed in the public surveys to
star-forming regions within the galaxy. We confirm and refine the redshift
estimate, $z=0.341\pm0.004$, with a dedicated TNG spectroscopic observation.
Finally, we compiled a list of all the known hosts of GRB afterglows detected
in radio and computed the corresponding radio luminosity: if GRB~200716C
belongs to J1304+2938, this is the third most radio-luminous host of a GRB,
implying one of the highest star-formation rates (SFRs) currently known, namely
SFR$\sim$324$\pm$61 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. On the other hand, through the
analysis of the prompt emission light curve, recent works suggest that
GRB~200716C might be a short-duration GRB located beyond J1304$+$2938 and
gravitationally lensed by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) hosted by the
galaxy. Neither the public data nor our VLBI observations can confirm or rule
out the presence of an IMBH acting as a (milli-)lens hosted by the galaxy, a
scenario still compatible with the set of radio observations presented in this

revealed to correlate with COVID-19 as well. In this work, rather than relying
on a specific body sound, we propose Fused Audio Instance and Representation
for COVID-19 Detection (FAIR4Cov). It relies on constructing a joint feature
vector obtained from a plurality of body sounds in waveform and spectrogram
representation. The core component of FAIR4Cov is a self-attention fusion unit
that is trained to establish the relation of multiple body sounds and audio
representations and integrate it into a compact feature vector. We set up our
experiments on different combinations of body sounds using only waveform,

findings show that the use of self-attention to combine extracted features from

in an SLM-based Michelson interferometer. In our design, we use a reflective
SLM as a mirror in one of the arms of a Michelson interferometer, and scan the
interferometer by varying the phase across the SLM display. For achieving the
latter, we apply a checkerboard phase mask on the SLM display where the gray
value varies between 0-255, thereby imparting a dynamic phase of up to
262{\deg} to the incident light beam. We couple a supercontinuum source into
the interferometer in order to mimic an astronomical object such as the Sun,
and choose a central wavelength of 637.4 nm akin to the strong emission line of
Fe X present in the solar spectrum. We use a bandwidth of 30 nm, and extract
fringes corresponding to a spectral resolution of 3.8 nm which is limited by
the reflectivity of the SLM. We also demonstrate a maximum wavelength
tunability of ~8 nm by varying the phase over the phase mask with a spectral
sampling of around 0.03 nm between intermediate fringes. The checkerboard phase
mask can be adapted close to real time on time-scales of a few tens of
milliseconds to obtain spectral information for other near-contiguous
wavelengths. The compactness, potential low cost, low power requirements,
real-time tunability and lack of moving mechanical parts in the setup implies
that it can have very useful applications in settings which require near
real-time, multi-wavelength spectroscopic applications, and is especially
relevant in space astronomy.

that the category of $R$-modules is locally presentable, from which it easily
follows that this category becomes a model of intuitionistic linear logic with
the cofree exponential. We then discuss constructions of classical models and

based on revised definitions of repairs and consistent answers, which opens up
the possibility of efficient approximations with explicit error guarantees. The
main idea is to iteratively apply operations (e.g., fact deletions), starting
from an inconsistent database, until we reach a database that is consistent
w.r.t. the given set of constraints. This gives us the flexibility of choosing
the probability with which we apply an operation, which in turn allows us to
calculate the probability of an operational repair, and thus, the probability
with which a consistent answer is entailed. A natural way of assigning
probabilities to operations is by targeting the uniform probability
distribution over a reasonable space such as the set of operational repairs,
the set of sequences of operations that lead to an operational repair, and the
set of available operations at a certain step of the repairing process. This
leads to what we generally call uniform operational CQA. The goal of this work
is to perform a data complexity analysis of both exact and approximate uniform
operational CQA, focusing on functional dependencies (and subclasses thereof),
and conjunctive queries. The main outcome of our analysis (among other positive
and negative results), is that uniform operational CQA pushes the efficiency
boundaries further by ensuring the existence of efficient approximation schemes
in scenarios that go beyond the simple case of primary keys, which seems to be
the limit of the classical approach to CQA.

An intriguing side effect of sparse MoE layers is that they convey inherent
interpretability to a model via natural expert specialization. In this work, we
apply sparse MoE layers to CNNs for computer vision tasks and analyze the
resulting effect on model interpretability. To stabilize MoE training, we
present both soft and hard constraint-based approaches. With hard constraints,
the weights of certain experts are allowed to become zero, while soft
constraints balance the contribution of experts with an additional auxiliary
loss. As a result, soft constraints handle expert utilization better and
support the expert specialization process, while hard constraints maintain more
generalized experts and increase overall model performance. Our findings
demonstrate that experts can implicitly focus on individual sub-domains of the
input space. For example, experts trained for CIFAR-100 image classification
specialize in recognizing different domains such as flowers or animals without
previous data clustering. Experiments with RetinaNet and the COCO dataset
further indicate that object detection experts can also specialize in detecting
objects of distinct sizes.

elapsed proper time along its single classical trajectory. In contrast, quantum
theory allows the association of many simultaneous paths with a single quantum
clock. Here, we investigate how the superposition principle affects the
gravitational time dilation observed by a simple clock -- a decaying two-level
atom. Placing such an atom in a superposition of positions enables us to
analyze a quantum contribution to a classical time dilation, manifested in the
process of spontaneous emission. In particular, we show that the emission rate
of an atom prepared in a coherent superposition of separated wave packets in a
gravitational field is different from the transition rate of the atom in a
classical mixture of these packets, which gives rise to a
nonclassical-gravitational time dilation effect. In addition, we show the
effect of spatial coherence on the atom's emission spectrum.

spherical colloids to polymers. To start with, we study a simple spherical
colloid. We analyze the features of the velocity fields of the surrounding
solvent, when the colloid is a pusher, a puller or a neutral swimmer either in
bulk or confined in a cylindrical channel. Next, we characterise its dynamical
behaviour by computing the mean square displacement and the long time diffusion
when the active colloid is in bulk or in a channel (varying its radius) and
analyze the orientation autocorrelation function in the latter case. While the
three studied squirmer types are characterised by the same bulk diffusion, the
cylindrical confinement considerably modulates the diffusion and the
orientation autocorrelation function. Finally, we focus our attention on a more
complex shape: an active polymer. We first characterise the structural features
computing its radius of gyration when in bulk or in cylindrical confinement,
and compare to known results obtained without hydrodynamics. Next, we
characterise the dynamical behaviour of the active polymer by computing its
mean square displacement and the long time diffusion. On the one hand, both
diffusion and radius of gyration decrease due to the hydrodynamic interaction
when the system is in bulk. On the other hand, the effect of confinement is to
decrease the radius of gyration, disturbing the motion of the polymer and thus
reducing its diffusion.

the monitoring of two quadratures of an optical field, the signal. By using
quantum Bose fields and quantum stochastic calculus, we give a complete quantum
description of this apparatus, when used as quadrature detector in continuous
time. We can treat either the travelling waves in the optical circuit, either
the observables involved in the detection part: two couples of photodiodes,
postprocessing of the output currents. The analysis includes imperfections,
such as not perfectly balanced beam splitters, detector efficiency, electronic
noise, phase and intensity noise in the laser acting as local oscillator; this
last noise is modelled by using mixtures of field coherent states as
statistical operator of the laser component. Due to the monitoring in
continuous time, the output is a stochastic process and its full probability
distribution is obtained. When the output process is sampled at discrete times,
the quantum description can be reduced to discrete mode operators, but at the
price of having random operators, which contain also the noise of the local
oscillator. Consequently, the local oscillator noise has a very different
effect on the detection results with respect to an additive noise, such as the
noise in the electronic components. As an application, the problem of secure
random number generation is considered, based on the local oscillator shot
noise. The rate of random bits that can be generated is quantified by the
min-entropy; the possibility of classical and quantum side information is taken
into account by suitable conditional min-entropies. The final rate depends on
which parts of the apparatus are considered to be secure and on which ones are
considered to be exposed to the intervention of an intruder. In some
experimentally realistic situations, the entropy losses are computed.

  arXiv:2006.15836",,,,"math.CT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Most texts on Category Theory are written in a very terse style, in which
people pretend a) that all concepts are visualizable, and b) that the readers
can reconstruct the diagrams that the authors had in mind based on only the
most essential cues. As an outsider I spent years believing that the techniques
for drawing diagrams were part of the oral culture of the field, and that the
insiders could read texts on CT reconstructing the ""missing diagrams"" in them
line by line and paragraph by paragraph, and drawing for each page of text a
page of diagrams with all the diagrams that the authors had omitted. My belief
was wrong: there are lots of conventions for drawing diagrams scattered through
the literature, but that unified diagrammatic language did not exist. In this
chapter I will show an attempt to reconstruct that (imaginary) language for
missing diagrams: we will see an extensible diagrammatic language, called DL,
that follows the conventions of the diagrams in the literature of CT whenever
possible and that seems to be adequate for drawing ""missing diagrams"" for
Category Theory. Our examples include the ""missing diagrams"" for adjunctions,
for the Yoneda Lemma, for Kan extensions, and for geometric morphisms, and how
to formalize them in Agda.

attributed to the fact that most research is directed towards improving

case of the fundamental problem of autonomously deciding when exploration has

appropriate stopping criteria and analyse the behaviour of a novel criterion

desirable interaction among support and query features and/or their prototypes,
under the episodic training scenario. Most existing FSS methods implement such
support-query interactions by solely leveraging plain operations - e.g., cosine
similarity and feature concatenation - for segmenting the query objects.
However, these interaction approaches usually cannot well capture the intrinsic
object details in the query images that are widely encountered in FSS, e.g., if
the query object to be segmented has holes and slots, inaccurate segmentation
almost always happens. To this end, we propose a dynamic prototype convolution
network (DPCN) to fully capture the aforementioned intrinsic details for
accurate FSS. Specifically, in DPCN, a dynamic convolution module (DCM) is
firstly proposed to generate dynamic kernels from support foreground, then
information interaction is achieved by convolution operations over query
features using these kernels. Moreover, we equip DPCN with a support activation
module (SAM) and a feature filtering module (FFM) to generate pseudo mask and
filter out background information for the query images, respectively. SAM and
FFM together can mine enriched context information from the query features. Our
DPCN is also flexible and efficient under the k-shot FSS setting. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that DPCN yields superior
performances under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings.

correspond to stochastic maps between classical variables, such simulation is
possible even in multipartite scenarios. These two results have proven useful
when studying the properties of these channels, such as their communication and
information processing power, and even when defining measures of the
non-classicality of physical phenomena (such as Bell non-classicality and

non-signalling channels in quantum theory, as well as in a larger family of

learning for effective search. Some recent studies have shown that
autoencoder-based language models are able to boost the dense retrieval
performance using a weak decoder. However, we argue that 1) it is not
discriminative to decode all the input texts and, 2) even a weak decoder has
the bypass effect on the encoder. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel
contrastive span prediction task to pre-train the encoder alone, but still
retain the bottleneck ability of the autoencoder. % Therefore, in this work, we
propose to drop out the decoder and introduce a novel contrastive span
prediction task to pre-train the encoder alone. The key idea is to force the
encoder to generate the text representation close to its own random spans while
far away from others using a group-wise contrastive loss. In this way, we can
1) learn discriminative text representations efficiently with the group-wise
contrastive learning over spans and, 2) avoid the bypass effect of the decoder
thoroughly. Comprehensive experiments over publicly available retrieval
benchmark datasets show that our approach can outperform existing pre-training
methods for dense retrieval significantly.

usually assessed qualitatively using critical appraisal, and quantitative bias

performed over a set of coherent probability distributions, where the set
emerges from a set of bias terms. We show how the set of bias terms can be
specified based on judgments on the relative magnitude of biases (i.e., low,
unclear and high risk of bias) in one or several domains of the Cochrane's risk
of bias table. For illustration, we apply a robust Bayesian bias-adjusted

multiple machine learning models, including a linear discriminant analysis

After training the machine learning models, a validation phase of the

determine how the game moved. We find that a CNN trained to the specific user
playing the game performed with the highest activation accuracy from the

condensates are most often based on semi-classical approximations. Since the
complex-valued field-theoretic action of the Bose gas does not offer itself to
the direct application of standard Monte Carlo techniques, simulations beyond
their scope by now almost exclusively rely on quantum-mechanical techniques.
Here we explore an alternative approach based on a Langevin-type sampling in an
extended state space, known as complex Langevin (CL) algorithm. While the use
of the CL technique has a long-standing history in high-energy physics, in
particular in the simulation of QCD at finitebaryon density, applications to
ultracold atoms are still in their infancy. Here we examine the applicability
of the CL approach for a one- and two-component, three-dimensional
non-relativistic Bose gas in thermal equilibrium, below and above the
Bose-Einstein phase transition. By comparison with analytic descriptions at the
Gaussian level, including Bogoliubov and Hartree-Fock theory, we find that the
method allows computing reliably and efficiently observables in the regime of
experimentally accessible parameters. Close to the transition, quantum
corrections lead to a shift of the critical temperature which we reproduce
within the numerical range known in the literature. With this work, we aim to
provide a first test of CL as a potential out-of-the-box tool for the
simulation of experimentally realistic situations, including trapping

consequence of it is a shift of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations of
linear-response conductance in an interference device where two ends of the SC

acting and use of resources require embracing risk. Performing actions in such
domains always entails costs of consuming some resource, such as time, money,
or energy, where the knowledge about these costs can range from totally known
to totally unknown and even unknowable probabilities of costs. Think of robotic
domains, where actions and their costs are non-deterministic due to uncertain
factors like obstacles. Choosing which action to perform considering its cost
on the available resource requires taking a stance on risk. Thus, these domains
call for not only planning under uncertainty but also planning while embracing
risk. Taking Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning as a widely used planning
technique in real-world applications, one can observe that existing approaches
do not account for risk. That is, computing most probable or optimal plans
using actions with single-valued costs is only enough to express risk
neutrality. In this work, we postulate that HTN planning can become risk aware
by considering expected utility theory, a representative concept of decision
theory that enables choosing actions considering a probability distribution of
their costs and a given risk attitude expressed using a utility function. In
particular, we introduce a general framework for HTN planning that allows
modelling risk and uncertainty using a probability distribution of action costs

  than Dot-Product Self-Attention","10 pages, 5 figures, accepted by CVPR2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-Attention is a widely used building block in neural modeling to mix
long-range data elements. Most self-attention neural networks employ pairwise
dot-products to specify the attention coefficients. However, these methods
require $O(N^2)$ computing cost for sequence length $N$. Even though some
approximation methods have been introduced to relieve the quadratic cost, the
performance of the dot-product approach is still bottlenecked by the low-rank
constraint in the attention matrix factorization. In this paper, we propose a
novel scalable and effective mixing building block called Paramixer. Our method
factorizes the interaction matrix into several sparse matrices, where we
parameterize the non-zero entries by MLPs with the data elements as input. The
overall computing cost of the new building block is as low as $O(N \log N)$.
Moreover, all factorizing matrices in Paramixer are full-rank, so it does not
suffer from the low-rank bottleneck. We have tested the new method on both
synthetic and various real-world long sequential data sets and compared it with
several state-of-the-art attention networks. The experimental results show that
Paramixer has better performance in most learning tasks.

examples of functions with such a gap. We present a new technique
(""reordering"") for proving lower bounds and upper bounds for OBDD with an
arbitrary order of input variables if we have similar bounds for the natural

the deterministic $OBDD$ complexity of it is at least $2^{\Omega(n / \log n)}$,
and the quantum $OBDD$ complexity of it is at most $O(n^2/\log n)$. It is the
biggest known gap for explicit functions not representable by $OBDD$s of a
linear width. Another function(shifted equality function) allows us to obtain a
gap $2^{\Omega(n)}$ vs $O(n^2)$.
  Moreover, we prove the bounded error quantum and probabilistic $OBDD$ width
hierarchies for complexity classes of Boolean functions. Additionally, using
""reordering"" method we extend a hierarchy for read-$k$-times Ordered Binary

have revealed the benefits of ensemble methods, and in particular, a multiple
kernel learning approach to the problem, one limitation of such techniques is
that they typically treat the entire observation space similarly and ignore any
variability and local structure inherent to the data. This work studies this
aspect of the face presentation attack detection problem in relation to
multiple kernel learning in a one-class setting to benefit from intrinsic local
structure in bona fide face samples. More concretely, inspired by the success
of the one-class Fisher null formalism, we formulate a convex localised
multiple kernel learning algorithm by imposing a joint matrix-norm constraint
on the collection of local kernel weights and infer locally adaptive weights
for zero-shot one-class unseen attack detection.
  We present a theoretical study of the proposed localised MKL algorithm using
Rademacher complexities to characterise its generalisation capability and
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed technique over some other options.
An assessment of the proposed approach on general object image datasets
illustrates its efficacy for abnormality and novelty detection while the

SeqSGPV encompasses existing strategies to monitor Region of Practical
Equivalence (ROPE) or Region of Equivalence (ROE) hypotheses. Hence, our focus
is to formalize sequential SGPV monitoring; establish a novel set of scientific
hypotheses, called PRISM, which is a ROE with a ROPE surrounding the null
hypothesis; and use monitoring frequency and a novel affirmation step to
control Type I error. Under immediate and delayed outcomes, we assess finite
and limiting SeqSGPV operating characteristics when monitoring PRISM, ROPE, and
null-bound ROE hypotheses. In extensive simulations, SeqSGPV PRISM monitoring
reduced wait time for fully sequential monitoring, average sample size, and
reversals of null hypothesis conclusions under the null. With real-world data,
we design a SeqSGPV-monitored randomized trial. SeqSGPV is method-agnostic and
easy to implement. Adjusting monitoring frequency/affirmation and monitoring a
one-sided PRISM synergistically control Type I error. PRISM monitoring and

of arrival are impaired by non-line of sight propagation, which negatively
affects the consistency that they expect among distance estimates. Instead,
fingerprinting localization is robust to these propagation conditions but
requires the costly collection of large data sets. To alleviate these
limitations, the present paper capitalizes on the recently-proposed notion of
channel charting to learn the geometry of the space that contains the channel
state information (CSI) measurements collected by the nodes to be localized.
The proposed algorithm utilizes a deep neural network that learns distances
between pairs of nodes using their measured CSI. Unlike standard channel
charting approaches, this algorithm directly works with the physical geometry
and therefore only implicitly learns the geometry of the radio domain.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms its
competitors and allows accurate localization in emergency scenarios using an
unmanned aerial vehicle.

This
is the variant of the classic fugitive search game on graphs where searchers
may be placed to (or removed from) the vertices or slide along edges. Moreover,
the fugitive resides on the edges of the graph and can move at any time along
unguarded paths. The mixed search number against an agile and visible fugitive
of a graph $G$, denoted $avms(G)$, is the minimum number of searchers required
to capture to fugitive in this graph searching variant. Our main result is that
this graph searching variant is monotone in the sense that the number of
searchers required for a successful search strategy does not increase if we
restrict the search strategies to those that do not permit the fugitive to
visit an already clean edge. This means that mixed search strategies against an
agile and visible fugitive can be polynomially certified, and therefore that
the problem of deciding, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k,$ whether
$avms(G)\leq k$ is in NP. Our proof is based on the introduction of the notion
of tight bramble, that serves as an obstruction for the corresponding search
parameter. Our results imply that for a graph $G$, $avms(G)$ is equal to the
Cartesian tree product number of $G$ that is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ is a
minor of the Cartesian product of a tree and a clique on $k$ vertices.

conclude that both SD and PD result from phase wash-out effects of different

the important issues on developing high-performance magnetic refrigeration
systems. In the present study, we achieved in producing spherical particles of
a giant magnetocaloric compound HoB2 by a crucible-free gas atomization
process, despite its high melting point of 2350 C. The particle size
distribution ranges from 100 to 710 micrometers centered at 212-355 micrometers
with the highest yield of 14-20wt% of total melted electrode, which is suitable
for magnetic refrigeration systems. The majority of the resulting particles are
mostly spherical with no contamination during the processing, while unique
microstructures are observed on the surface and inside. These spherical
particles exhibit sharp magnetic transitions and huge magnetic entropy change
of 0.34 J cm^{-3} K^{-1} for a magnetic field change of 5 T at 15.5 K. The high
sphericality and the high magnetocaloric performance suggest that the HoB2
gas-atomized particles have good potential as magnetic refrigerants for use in
magnetic refrigerators for hydrogen liquefaction.

states over time has a major impact on their dynamics. In particular, depending
on the chosen update schedule, the underlying dynamical systems may exhibit
more or less asymptotic dynamical behaviours such as fixed points or limit

biological networks modelling, the question of choosing appropriate update
schedules has arised soon. In this note, focusing on Boolean networks, our aim
is to emphasise that the adequate way of thinking regulations and genetic
expression over time is certainly not to consider a wall segregating
synchronicity from asynchronicity because they actually complement rather well.
In particular, we highlight that specific update schedules, namely
block-parallel update schedules, whose intrinsic features are still not known
from a theoretical point of view, admit realistic and pertinent properties in
the context of biological modelling and deserve certainly more attention from
the community.

quality and scale of the manually-constructed training corpus, which could be
extremely difficult to satisfy. Crowdsourcing is one practical solution for
this problem, aiming to create a large-scale but quality-unguaranteed corpus.
In this work, we investigate Chinese OEI with extremely-noisy crowdsourcing
annotations, constructing a dataset at a very low cost. Following zhang et al.
(2021), we train the annotator-adapter model by regarding all annotations as
gold-standard in terms of crowd annotators, and test the model by using a
synthetic expert, which is a mixture of all annotators. As this
annotator-mixture for testing is never modeled explicitly in the training
phase, we propose to generate synthetic training samples by a pertinent mixup
strategy to make the training and testing highly consistent. The simulation
experiments on our constructed dataset show that crowdsourcing is highly
promising for OEI, and our proposed annotator-mixup can further enhance the
crowdsourcing modeling.

in systematically classifying morbidity and mortality data. In this study, we
propose a hierarchical label-wise attention Transformer model (HiLAT) for the
explainable prediction of ICD codes from clinical documents. HiLAT firstly
fine-tunes a pretrained Transformer model to represent the tokens of clinical
documents. We subsequently employ a two-level hierarchical label-wise attention
mechanism that creates label-specific document representations. These
representations are in turn used by a feed-forward neural network to predict
whether a specific ICD code is assigned to the input clinical document of
interest. We evaluate HiLAT using hospital discharge summaries and their
corresponding ICD-9 codes from the MIMIC-III database. To investigate the
performance of different types of Transformer models, we develop
ClinicalplusXLNet, which conducts continual pretraining from XLNet-Base using
all the MIMIC-III clinical notes. The experiment results show that the F1
scores of the HiLAT+ClinicalplusXLNet outperform the previous state-of-the-art
models for the top-50 most frequent ICD-9 codes from MIMIC-III. Visualisations

the scaling factors and the initial states of the agents. In the matrix-scaled

  Multi-Label Image Recognition","Accepted to ICME 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Previous works on multi-label image recognition (MLIR) usually use CNNs as a
starting point for research. In this paper, we take pure Vision Transformer
(ViT) as the research base and make full use of the advantages of Transformer
with long-range dependency modeling to circumvent the disadvantages of CNNs
limited to local receptive field. However, for multi-label images containing
multiple objects from different categories, scales, and spatial relations, it
is not optimal to use global information alone. Our goal is to leverage ViT's
patch tokens and self-attention mechanism to mine rich instances in multi-label
images, named diverse instance discovery (DiD). To this end, we propose a
semantic category-aware module and a spatial relationship-aware module,
respectively, and then combine the two by a re-constraint strategy to obtain
instance-aware attention maps. Finally, we propose a weakly supervised object
localization-based approach to extract multi-scale local features, to form a
multi-view pipeline. Our method requires only weakly supervised information at
the label level, no additional knowledge injection or other strongly supervised
information is required. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our
method significantly outperforms previous works and achieves state-of-the-art
results under fair experimental comparisons.

circuits can outperform CMOS counterparts in terms of energy consumption. In
view of the zero power SWs propagation through ferromagnetic waveguides, the
overall SW circuit power consumption is determined by the one associated to SWs
generation and sensing by means of transducers. While current antenna based
transducers are clearly power hungry recent developments indicate that
magneto-electric (ME) cells have a great potential for ultra-low power SW
generation and sensing. Given that MEs have been only proposed at the
conceptual level and no actual experimental demonstration has been reported we
cannot evaluate the impact of their utilization on the SW circuit energy
consumption. However, we can perform a reverse engineering alike analysis to
determine ME delay and power consumption upper bounds that can place SW
circuits in the leading position. To this end, we utilize a 32-bit Brent-Kung
Adder (BKA) as discussion vehicle and compute the maximum ME delay and power
consumption that could potentially enable a SW implementation able to
outperform its 7nm CMOS counterpart. We evaluate different BKA SW
implementations that rely on conversion or normalization gate cascading and
consider continuous or pulsed SW generation scenarios. 31nW is the maximum

on a series of burner-stabilized premixed flames under mild to severe sooting
conditions. Herein, mixtures of ethylene in combination with the three
individual OMEn for n=2-4 are compared in terms of soot formation behavior with
pure ethylene flames. The kinetic mechanism from Sun et al. (Proc. Combust.
Inst. 36, 1269-1278, 2017) for oxymethylene ether OMEn combustion with n=1-3 is
extended to include OME4 decomposition and combustion kinetics. In the
numerical simulations, the kinetic mechanism is combined with a detailed
quadvariate soot model which uses the Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments
and validated with Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Laser-Induced
Incandescence (LII) measurements. It is observed, that the three investigated
OMEn with n=2-4 show similar sooting behavior, mainly reducing larger
aggregates while not significantly affecting the formation of smaller
particles. Furthermore, the extent of soot reduction is comparable among the
three OMEn. The trends and overall reduction are very well captured by the
model. The modeling results are analyzed through reaction path analyses and
sensitivity studies which show the important role of OMEn decomposition and the
formation of CH2O under these rich conditions to reduce species relevant for
soot formation. This is at the base of the negligible observed differences in
terms of soot formation for the different OMEn fuels.

ratio. Most clinical trials are monitored for the possibility of early
stopping. Because ordinarily the outcome on any given subject can be
ascertained only after some time lag, at the time of an interim analysis, among
the subjects already enrolled, the outcome is known for only a subset and is
effectively censored for those who have not been enrolled sufficiently long for
it to be observed. Typically, the interim analysis is based only on the data
from subjects for whom the outcome has been ascertained. A goal of an interim
analysis is to stop the trial as soon as the evidence is strong enough to do
so, suggesting that the analysis ideally should make the most efficient use of
all available data, thus including information on censoring as well as other

sequential framework is proposed for clinical trials with a time-lagged

incorporate covariate information at an interim analysis are derived using

phenomena, such as charge separation and light emission. However, existing
quantum algorithms mainly focus on the ground state, including quantum phase
estimation and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Even though there are
extensions of VQE-type methods for excited states, these methods suffer from
optimization problems. Alternatively, the quantum Krylov subspace (QKS) concept
has been proposed to calculate ground and excited states, providing a low-cost
alternative to quantum phase estimation. However, current QKS methods rely on a
pre-generated subspace via real- or imaginary-time evolutions. Such subspace is
not compact and may suffer from slow convergence and/or numerical stability
problems, resulting in deep circuits. In this work, we develop an economic QKS
algorithm, namely the quantum Davidson (QDavidson) algorithm, by leveraging the
iterative growth of Krylov subspace and pre-conditioner within the Davidson
scheme. The residues of eigenstates are used to expand the Krylov subspace,
leading to a compact Krylov subspace close to the exact solutions.
Consequently, fast convergence is achieved compared to other QKS methods (e.g.,
quantum Lanczos). The newly proposed QDavidson algorithm is employed to study
the excited-state properties of various systems, including the Heisenberg spin
model and real molecules on quantum simulators. Compared to the existing QKS
method, the QDavidson algorithm converges fast and results in a much shallower
circuit, making QDavidson a practical algorithm for computing both ground and
excited states properties on quantum computers.

show that the well-known dependence of Bayes factors on the analysis priors in
regions of the parameter space without likelihood support can lead to strong
confidence in favor of incorrect conclusions when one employs the
multiplicative Bayes factor. Bayes factors $\mathcal{O}(1)$ are ambivalent as
they depend sensitively on the analysis priors, which are rarely set in a
principled way; additionally, combined Bayes factors $>\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ can
be obtained in favor of the incorrect conclusion depending on the analysis
priors when many $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Bayes factors are multiplied, and
specifically when the priors are much wider than the underlying population. The
hierarchical analysis that instead infers the ensemble distribution of the
individual beyond-general-relativity constraints does not suffer from this

up sequential execution of OLTP transactions, wherein alternative database

impeding inter-transaction parallelism to fully manifest. However,
intra-transaction parallelism has been largely ignored by this previous work.
We conjecture this situation to have developed because OLTP workloads are
sometimes deemed to have far too little intra-transactional parallelism and,
even when this kind of parallelism is available, program analyses to recognize
it in arbitrary stored procedures are considered too brittle to be used as a
general tool. Recently, however, a new concept of actor-relational database

specify intra-transaction parallelism by modeling database applications as

adequately expose the intra-transaction parallelism available in application
logic to modern multi-core hardware. Towards that aim, we conduct in this paper

we derive rigorous closed-form approximations that are valid over a wide range

  Point Cloud Upsampling",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  High-quality point clouds have practical significance for point-based
rendering, semantic understanding, and surface reconstruction. Upsampling
sparse, noisy and nonuniform point clouds for a denser and more regular
approximation of target objects is a desirable but challenging task. Most
existing methods duplicate point features for upsampling, constraining the
upsampling scales at a fixed rate. In this work, the flexible upsampling rates
are achieved via edge vector based affine combinations, and a novel design of
Edge Vector based Approximation for Flexible-scale Point clouds Upsampling
(PU-EVA) is proposed. The edge vector based approximation encodes the
neighboring connectivity via affine combinations based on edge vectors, and
restricts the approximation error within the second-order term of Taylor's
Expansion. The EVA upsampling decouples the upsampling scales with network
architecture, achieving the flexible upsampling rates in one-time training.
Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PU-EVA
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of proximity-to-surface, distribution
uniformity, and geometric details preservation.

problem can be seen as a generalization of the classic list update problem to
trees, and finds applications in reconfigurable datacenter networks. We are
given a fixed balanced binary tree T connecting n nodes V = {v_1, ... , v_n}. A
source node v_0, attached to the root of the tree, issues communication
requests to nodes in V, in an online and adversarial manner; the access cost of
a request to a node v, is given by the current depth of v in T. The online
algorithm can try to reduce the access cost by performing swap operations, with
which the position of a node is exchanged with the position of its parent in
the tree; a swap operation costs one unit. The objective is to design an online
algorithm which minimizes the total access cost plus adjustment cost
(swapping). Avin et al. recently presented Random-Push, a constant competitive
online algorithm for this problem, based on random walks, together with an
analysis exploiting the most recently used (MRU) property of random walks.
  We study analytically and empirically, online algorithms for this problem. In
particular, we explore how to derandomize Random-Push. We consider a simple
derandomized algorithm which we call Rotor-Push, as its behavior is reminiscent
of rotor walks. We first prove that Rotor-Push is constant competitive: its
competitive ratio is 12 and hence by a factor of five lower than the best
existing competitive ratio. In contrast to Random-Push, the algorithm does not
feature the MRU property, which requires a new analysis. We present a
significantly improved and simpler analysis for the randomized algorithm,
showing that it is 16-competitive. We compare empirically all self-adjusting
single-source tree networks, using synthetic and real data with varying

two categories: ones that learn from large amounts of data via imitation
learning, and ones that assume human behavior to be noisily-optimal for some
reward function. The former are very useful, but only when it is possible to
gather a lot of human data in the target environment and distribution. The
advantage of the latter type, which includes Boltzmann rationality, is the
ability to make accurate predictions in new environments without extensive data
when humans are actually close to optimal. However, these models fail when
humans exhibit systematic suboptimality, i.e. when their deviations from
optimal behavior are not independent, but instead consistent over time. Our key
insight is that systematic suboptimality can be modeled by predicting policies,
which couple action choices over time, instead of trajectories. We introduce
the Boltzmann policy distribution (BPD), which serves as a prior over human
policies and adapts via Bayesian inference to capture systematic deviations by
observing human actions during a single episode. The BPD is difficult to
compute and represent because policies lie in a high-dimensional continuous
space, but we leverage tools from generative and sequence models to enable
efficient sampling and inference. We show that the BPD enables prediction of
human behavior and human-AI collaboration equally as well as imitation
learning-based human models while using far less data.

that these two learning tasks are complementary, and suggest combining them for
better visual learning. We propose a deep fusion method with three adaptations
that effectively bridge two learning tasks, rather than shallow fusion through
naive multi-task learning. First, we modify the previous common practice in
image classification, a linear classifier, with a cosine classifier which shows
comparable performance. Second, we convert the image classification problem
from learning parametric category classifier weights to learning a text encoder
as a meta network to generate category classifier weights. The learnt text
encoder is shared between image classification and image-text alignment. Third,
we enrich each class name with a description to avoid confusion between classes
and make the classification method closer to the image-text alignment. We prove
that this deep fusion approach performs better on a variety of visual
recognition tasks and setups than the individual learning or shallow fusion
approach, from zero-shot/few-shot image classification, such as the Kornblith
12-dataset benchmark, to downstream tasks of action recognition, semantic

with segmenting and tracking object instances across a video sequence. Most
existing methods typically accomplish this task by employing a multi-stage
top-down approach that usually involves separate networks to detect and segment
objects in each frame, followed by associating these detections in consecutive
frames using a learned tracking head. In this work, however, we introduce a
simple end-to-end trainable bottom-up approach to achieve instance mask
predictions at the pixel-level granularity, instead of the typical
region-proposals-based approach. Unlike contemporary frame-based models, our
network pipeline processes an input video clip as a single 3D volume to
incorporate temporal information. The central idea of our formulation is to
solve the video instance segmentation task as a tag assignment problem, such
that generating distinct tag values essentially separates individual object
instances across the video sequence (here each tag could be any arbitrary value
between 0 and 1). To this end, we propose a novel spatio-temporal tagging loss
that allows for sufficient separation of different objects as well as necessary
identification of different instances of the same object. Furthermore, we
present a tag-based attention module that improves instance tags, while
concurrently learning instance propagation within a video. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method provides competitive results on YouTube-VIS and
DAVIS-19 datasets, and has minimum run-time compared to other state-of-the-art
performance methods.

two are correlated with pulsars assuming a unique spin-down rate ($\dot{\nu}$)
for each of their specific emission states. In this work we revisit 17 radio
pulsars previously shown to exhibit spin-down rate variations. Using a Gaussian
process regression (GPR) method to model the timing residuals and the evolution
of the profile shape, we confirm the transitions already observed and reveal
new transitions in 8 years of extended monitoring with greater time resolution

emission-correlated $\dot{\nu}$ transitions ($\Delta \dot{\nu}$) and we

$\Delta \dot{\nu}$ to changes in the global magnetospheric charge density

approximations still struggle when the effects of electron-electron correlation
play a prominent role. The limit in which the electronic Coulomb repulsion
completely dominates the exchange-correlation functional offers a well-defined
mathematical framework that provides insight for new approximations able to
deal with strong correlation. In particular, the mathematical structure of this
limit, which is now well-established thanks to its reformulation as an optimal
transport problem, points to the use of very different ingredients (or
features) with respect to the traditional ones used in present approximations.
We focus on strategies to use these new ingredients to build approximations for
computational chemistry and highlight future promising directions.

altered the energy information landscape. However, our ability to use this
information to generate actionable insights about residential electricity
demand remains limited. In this research, we propose and test a new framework
for understanding residential electricity demand by using a dynamic energy
lifestyles approach that is iterative and highly extensible. To obtain energy
lifestyles, we develop a novel approach that applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), a method commonly used for inferring the latent topical
structure of text data, to extract a series of latent household energy
attributes. By doing so, we provide a new perspective on household electricity
consumption where each household is characterized by a mixture of energy
attributes that form the building blocks for identifying a sparse collection of
energy lifestyles. We examine this approach by running experiments on one year
of hourly smart meter data from 60,000 households and we extract six energy
attributes that describe general daily use patterns. We then use clustering
techniques to derive six distinct energy lifestyle profiles from energy
attribute proportions. Our lifestyle approach is also flexible to varying time
interval lengths, and we test our lifestyle approach seasonally (Autumn,
Winter, Spring, and Summer) to track energy lifestyle dynamics within and
across households and find that around 73% of households manifest multiple
lifestyles across a year. These energy lifestyles are then compared to
different energy use characteristics, and we discuss their practical
applications for demand response program design and lifestyle change analysis.

collimation was proposed previously (Dey, IEEE TNS 2012, Bhusal et al, Med.
Phys. 2019). Here, we hypothesize that a high curvature hemi-ellipsoid detector
results in measurable differences in light distribution from events at
different depths in the crystal. This was tested by analyzing the scintillation
light in hemi-ellipsoid detector using Monte-Carlo (Geant4) and evaluation of
both the localization error at detector and the back-projected errors in
object-space. We used Geant4 to simulate the propagation of scintillation light
in a monolithic hemi-ellipsoidal CsI crystal. A look-up table (LUT) was created
to map the points inside the crystal to the expected light pattern on the
crystal surface using Geant4. In thirteen zones across the crystal, gamma-rays
were simulated and the resulting scintillator light intensity on the surface
was captured, serving as our experimental interactions. A
Poisson-statistics-based algorithm was developed to limit the search of the
gamma-ray event locations into small regions of the LUT and fine-tuned by
interpolating between selected LUT points by comparing the light distribution
of the gamma interactions and LUT light patterns. The localized events were
individually back-projected to the object mid-plane, and the errors recorded.
Excluding some outliers (up to 2%), the localized errors averaged over all the
zones was 0.71 (+/-0.44) mm with a worse case of 1.36 (+/-0.67) mm at the apex.
When back-projected to the midplane of the object for Cardiac SPECT, the errors
were <1mm and average error was 0.4(+/-0.22) mm, due to the high system
magnification afforded by the detector. Thus, for our high sensitivity system,
we were also able to achieve high resolution, assuming perfect pinhole
collimator resolution recovery for Cardiac SPECT application.

Notionally, laser driven particle beam energies could scale beyond state of the

give a complete description for the eigenproblem. We show that the

some key assumptions: Inflation, Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Here we review
the idea that cosmic expansion originates instead from gravitational collapse
and bounce. The collapse generates a Black Hole (BH) of mass $ M \simeq 5

support, the cold collapse can continue inside in free fall until it reaches
atomic nuclear saturation (GeV), when is halted by Quantum Mechanics, as two
particles cannot occupy the same quantum state. The collapse then bounces like
a core-collapse supernovae, producing the Big Bang expansion. Cosmic
acceleration results from the BH event horizon. During collapse, perturbations
exit the horizon to re-enter during expansion, giving rise to the observed

of holographic density include time-varying part of the gravitational constant.
NMDC part reduces strength of gravitational constant for $\k > 0$ and opposite
for $\k < 0$. The holographic part enhances gravitational strength. We use

NMDC inflation is ruled out and the holographic NMDC inflation is also ruled

This geometry takes into account the quantum gravitational correction in the

various thermodynamic quantity like the Hawking temperature, specific heat and
entropy for the general parameter $\gamma$ for quantum corrected Schwarzschild
metric. We have noticed that the coefficient of the leading quantum correction,
that is, the logarithmic correction gets affected by the presence of $\gamma$.
We further study the local temperature, thermal stability of the black hole and
the free energy considering a cavity enclosing the black hole. According to the
local specific heat, there exists three black hole states, among them the large
and tiny black hole are thermally stable states. We further investigate the
on-shell free energy and find that no Hawking-Page phase transition occurs here
unlike the ordinary Schwarzschild black hole. The black hole state always
prevails for all temperatures. Also, we have found two critical points,
$T_{c1}$ and $T_{c2}$, corresponding to the phase transition from one black

control of devices such as prostheses and computer cursors, which have
demonstrated great potential for mobility restoration. One major limitation of
current BMIs lies in the unstable performance in online control due to the
variability of neural signals, which seriously hinders the clinical
availability of BMIs. Method: To deal with the neural variability in online BMI
control, we propose a dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble). DyEnsemble
extends Bayesian filters with a dynamic measurement model, which adjusts its
parameters in time adaptively with neural changes. This is achieved by learning
a pool of candidate functions and dynamically weighting and assembling them
according to neural signals. In this way, DyEnsemble copes with variability in
signals and improves the robustness of online control. Results: Online BMI
experiments with a human participant demonstrate that, compared with the
velocity Kalman filter, DyEnsemble significantly improves the control accuracy
(increases the success rate by 13.9% and reduces the reach time by 13.5% in the
random target pursuit task) and robustness (performs more stably over different
experiment days). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the superiority of
DyEnsemble in online BMI control. Significance: DyEnsemble frames a novel and
flexible framework for robust neural decoding, which is beneficial to different

the decentralized data, while is susceptible when realizing client-specific
personalization in the presence of statistical heterogeneity. However, studies
focus on learning a robust global model or personalized classifiers, which
yield divergence due to inconsistent objectives. This paper shows that it is
possible to achieve flexible personalization after the convergence of the
global model by introducing representation learning. In this paper, we first
analyze and determine that non-IID data harms representation learning of the
global model. Existing FL methods adhere to the scheme of jointly learning
representations and classifiers, where the global model is an average of
classification-based local models that are consistently subject to
heterogeneity from non-IID data. As a solution, we separate representation
learning from classification learning in FL and propose RepPer, an independent
two-stage personalized FL framework.We first learn the client-side feature
representation models that are robust to non-IID data and aggregate them into a
global common representation model. After that, we achieve personalization by
learning a classifier head for each client, based on the common representation
obtained at the former stage. Notably, the proposed two-stage learning scheme
of RepPer can be potentially used for lightweight edge computing that involves
devices with constrained computation power.Experiments on various datasets
(CIFAR-10/100, CINIC-10) and heterogeneous data setup show that RepPer
outperforms alternatives in flexibility and personalization on non-IID data.

this work, we introduce the wavelet basis for reinforcement learning. Wavelets
can effectively be used as a fixed basis and additionally provide the ability
to adaptively refine the basis set as learning progresses, making it feasible
to start with a minimal basis set. This adaptive method can either increase the
granularity of the approximation at a point in state space, or add in
interactions between different dimensions as necessary. We prove that wavelets
are both necessary and sufficient if we wish to construct a function
approximator that can be adaptively refined without loss of precision. We

efficiency of poisoning. In this paper, we formulate improving the poisoned

their generation very little information and are consequently both highly
structured. We further argue that the structures of brain and natural
environment are closely related.
  Results: We propose that the structural regularity of the brain takes the

In the optical-mechanical analogy in general relativity, relativistic light
deflection is treated as refraction in an optical medium of varying density
gradient. We now model the optical medium analogue of spacetime as a real
graviton conjugate interlinking all masses. Gravitons in local mass systems are
assumed to be organized in coherent quantum states overlapping with those of
particles within spacetime structures. With the Hubble redshift, however,
gravitons acquire longer wavelengths as they are shifted to less coherent

Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation and takes into consideration the multiple
dimensions of the search space of the application. It aims to improve the final
solution and reduce the number of iterations and premature convergences of the
GSA. The GSA-NGC is validated experimentally, proving to be suitable for
various applications and improving significantly the generality, performance,
and efficiency of the GSA.
