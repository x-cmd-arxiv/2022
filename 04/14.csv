can be disassembled and reassembled in different robots, and possibly perform
new tasks. Nevertheless, actually exploiting modularity is yet an unsolved
problem: controllers usually rely on inter-module communication, a practical
requirement that makes modules not perfectly interchangeable and thus limits
their flexibility. Here, we focus on Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs),
aggregations of mechanically identical elastic blocks. We use the same neural
controller inside each voxel, but without any inter-voxel communication, hence
enabling ideal conditions for modularity: modules are all equal and
interchangeable. We optimize the parameters of the neural controller-shared
among the voxels-by evolutionary computation. Crucially, we use a local
self-attention mechanism inside the controller to overcome the absence of
inter-module communication channels, thus enabling our robots to truly be
driven by the collective intelligence of their modules. We show experimentally
that the evolved robots are effective in the task of locomotion: thanks to
self-attention, instances of the same controller embodied in the same robot can
focus on different inputs. We also find that the evolved controllers generalize
to unseen morphologies, after a short fine-tuning, suggesting that an inductive
bias related to the task arises from true modularity.

Passivation by a Ga gradient is shown to be as efficient as a passivation by

not because of less metastable defect transformation but because of a sublinear
increase in photo generated carriers with excitation. This reduction in diode

higher doping level, on the other hand, reduces the diode factor, thereby
increasing the fill factor, and at the same time increases the voltage.

performance on several downstream tasks for both high-resourced and
low-resourced languages. However, there is still a large performance drop for
languages unseen during pre-training, especially African languages. One of the
most effective approaches to adapt to a new language is \textit{language
adaptive fine-tuning} (LAFT) -- fine-tuning a multilingual PLM on monolingual
texts of a language using the pre-training objective. However, adapting to a
target language individually takes a large disk space and limits the
cross-lingual transfer abilities of the resulting models because they have been
specialized for a single language. In this paper, we perform
\textit{multilingual adaptive fine-tuning} on 17 most-resourced African
languages and three other high-resource languages widely spoken on the African
continent to encourage cross-lingual transfer learning. To further specialize
the multilingual PLM, we removed vocabulary tokens from the embedding layer
that corresponds to non-African writing scripts before MAFT, thus reducing the
model size by around 50%. Our evaluation on two multilingual PLMs (AfriBERTa
and XLM-R) and three NLP tasks (NER, news topic classification, and sentiment
classification) shows that our approach is competitive to applying LAFT on
individual languages while requiring significantly less disk space.
Additionally, we show that our adapted PLM also improves the zero-shot
cross-lingual transfer abilities of parameter efficient fine-tuning methods.

systems containing high-temperature superconductors (HTS) and ferromagnetic
materials (FM), in the context of a 3D motor pole model. The formulations are
evaluated in terms of their numerical robustness and efficiency. We propose a
coupled h-phi-a-formulation as an optimal choice, modeling the problem with an
a-formulation in the FM and an h-phi-formulation in the remaining domains.
While maintaining a low number of degrees of freedom, the h-phi-a-formulation
guarantees a robust resolution and strongly reduces the number of iterations
required for handling the nonlinearities of HTS and FM compared to standard
formulations.

clinical trials in healthcare. Trial sites, where the trials are conducted, are
chosen mainly based on feasibility in terms of medical expertise and access to
a large group of patients. More recently, the issue of diversity and inclusion
in clinical trials is gaining importance. Different patient groups may
experience the effects of a medical drug/ treatment differently and hence need
to be included in the clinical trials. These groups could be based on
ethnicity, co-morbidities, age, or economic factors. Thus, designing a method
for trial site selection that accounts for both feasibility and diversity is a
crucial and urgent goal. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a ranking
problem with fairness constraints. Using principles of fairness in machine
learning, we learn a model that maps a clinical trial description to a ranked
list of potential trial sites. Unlike existing fairness frameworks, the group
membership of each trial site is non-binary: each trial site may have access to
patients from multiple groups. We propose fairness criteria based on
demographic parity to address such a multi-group membership scenario. We test
our method on 480 real-world clinical trials and show that our model results in
a list of potential trial sites that provides access to a diverse set of
patients while also ensuing a high number of enrolled patients.

have labelled pronunciation data at the phonetic level, which is scarce for IE.
Moreover, versatility of IE stems from the influence of a large diversity of
the speakers' mother tongues and demographic region differences. Prior
linguistic works have characterised features of IE variabilities qualitatively
by reporting phonetic rules that represent such variations relative to RP. The
qualitative descriptions often lack quantitative descriptors and data-driven
analysis of diverse IE pronunciation data to characterise IE on the phonetic
level. To address these issues, in this work, we consider a corpus, Indic
TIMIT, containing a large set of IE varieties from 80 speakers from various

rules representing IE pronunciation variabilities relative to RP in a
data-driven manner. We do this using 15,974 phonetic transcriptions, of which
13,632 were obtained manually in addition to those part of the corpus.
Furthermore, we validate the rules obtained from the analysis against the
existing phonetic rules to identify the relevance of the obtained phonetic

can tell us about their atmospheric temperature structure. Telescopes such as
JWST and ARIEL will improve the quality and availability of these measurements.
This motivates an improved understanding of the processes that determine
atmospheric temperature structure, particularly atmospheric circulation. The
circulation is important in determining atmospheric temperatures, not only
through its ability to transport heat, but also because any circulation pattern
needs to be balanced by horizontal pressure contrasts, therefore implying a
particular temperature structure. In this work, we show how the global
temperature field on a tidally locked planet can be decomposed into
contributions that are balanced by different components of the atmospheric
circulation. These are the superrotating jet, stationary Rossby waves, and the
divergent circulation. To achieve this, we partition the geopotential field
into components balanced by the divergent circulation and the rotational
circulation, with the latter comprising the jet and Rossby waves. The
partitioned geopotential then implies a corresponding partitioning of the
temperature via the hydrostatic relation. We apply these diagnostics to
idealised general circulation model simulations, to show how the separate
rotational and divergent circulations together make up the total
three-dimensional atmospheric temperature structure. We also show how each
component contributes distinct signatures to the thermal phase curve of a
tidally locked planet. We conclude that this decomposition is a physically
meaningful separation of the temperature field that explains its global
structure, and can be used to fit observations of thermal emission.

augmented with structure-aware adapters to capture interactions among the
concepts based on the graph connectivity, along with text representations using
an adapter-based text encoder. Experiments on different benchmarks for
evaluating factuality show that FactGraph outperforms previous approaches by up

verifiability errors and better captures subsentence-level factual

learning a task with the explicit aim of being able to correct errors in the

perception of the environment which requires immediate corrective action. This
is especially the case for autonomous vehicles (AVs) navigating real-world
situations where safety is paramount, and a strong ability to react to a
changing belief about the environment is truly needed.

for learning robust contingency plans and combining them with a hierarchical
planner to obtain a robust agent policy in an autonomous navigation task where
other vehicles' behaviours are unknown, and the agent's belief about these

average less than one GC per galaxy and to a mass range in which mergers are

same systole, and whose volumes are explicitly bounded. Our second result fixes
a positive number x and gives an upper bound for the least volume of an
arithmetic hyperbolic 2- or 3-manifold whose systole is greater than x. We

supporting source code reuse awareness is in a real need. This paper studies
software reuse relations in FLOSS ecosystem. Technically, clone-and-own reuses
of source code can be identified by file-level clone set detection. Since
change histories are associated with files, we can determine origins and
destinations in reusing across multiple software by considering times. By
building software supply chain maps, we find that clone-and-own is prevalent in

stellar-mass black holes (BHs). However, the occurrence of singularities at the
centers of BHs suggests that GR is inapplicable because of the breakdown of the
equivalence principle at the singularities. The fact that these singularities
exist indicates that GR cannot be a universal theory of space-time. In the
low-energy limit, the theoretical and observational challenges faced by the
$\Lambda$CDM model also indicate that we might have to look beyond GR as the
underlying theory of gravity. Unlike GR, whose field equations contain only up
to second-order derivatives, the modified theories with higher derivative
Ricci/Riemann tensor gravity models include higher derivatives. Therefore, one
expects significant differences between GR and modified theories. Since there
are many ways of modifying GR in the strong-gravity and cosmological distances,
each model has unique features. This leads to the following crucial question:
Are there a set of unique signatures that distinguish GR from modified gravity
(MG) theories? This review discusses three aspects of MG theories: (1) Why do
we need to consider MG theories? (2) How to modify GR? and (3) What are the

gather valuable information about the problem instance during the optimization

computation is to identify the most effective ways to collect and exploit
instance knowledge. However, while considerable work is devoted to adjusting
hyper-parameters of black-box optimization algorithms on the fly or exchanging
some of its modular components, we barely know how to effectively switch
between different black-box optimization algorithms.
  In this work, we build on the recent study of Vermetten et al. [GECCO 2020],
who presented a data-driven approach to investigate promising switches between
pairs of algorithms for numerical black-box optimization. We replicate their
approach with a portfolio of five algorithms and investigate whether the
predicted performance gains are realized when executing the most promising
switches. Our results suggest that with a single switch between two algorithms,
we outperform the best static choice among the five algorithms on 48 out of the
120 considered problem instances, the 24 BBOB functions in five different
dimensions. We also show that for switching between BFGS and CMA-ES, a proper
warm-starting of the parameters is crucial to realize high-performance gains.
Lastly, with a sensitivity analysis, we find the actual performance gain per
run is largely affected by the switching point, and in some cases, the
switching point yielding the best actual performance differs from the one
computed from the theoretical gain.

seasonality strength and lag-1 autocorrelation of the precipitation time
series, and the stability and trend strength of the temperature time series)
were found to be useful predictors of many streamflow features. The same
applies to traditional attributes, such as the catchment mean elevation.
Relationships between predictor and dependent variables were also revealed,
while the spectral entropy, the seasonality strength and several
autocorrelation features of the streamflow time series were found to be more
regionalizable than others.

fundamental studies of superfluid dynamics and as prototypes for atomtronic
circuits. Here, we report on the realization of supercurrents in homogeneous,
tunable fermionic rings. We gain exquisite, rapid control over quantized
persistent currents in all regimes of the BCS-BEC crossover through a universal
phase-imprinting technique, attaining on-demand circulations $w$ as high as 9.
High-fidelity read-out of the superfluid circulation state is achieved by
exploiting an interferometric protocol, which also yields local information
about the superfluid phase around the ring. In the absence of externally
introduced perturbations, we find the induced metastable supercurrents to be as
long-lived as the atomic sample. Conversely, we trigger and inspect the
supercurrent decay by inserting a single small obstacle within the ring. For
circulations higher than a critical value, the quantized current is observed to
dissipate via the emission of vortices, i.e., quantized phase slips, which we
directly image, in good agreement with numerical simulations. The critical
circulation at which the superflow becomes unstable is found to depend starkly
on the interaction strength, taking its maximum value for the unitary Fermi
gas. Our results demonstrate fast and accurate control of quantized collective
excitations in a macroscopic quantum system, and establish strongly interacting

and severity due to climate change. To mitigate wildfire ignition risks,
electric power system operators proactively de-energize high-risk power lines
during ""public safety power shut-off"" (PSPS) events. Line de-energizations can
cause communities to lose power, which may result in negative economic, health,
and safety impacts. Furthermore, the same communities may repeatedly experience
power shutoffs over the course of a wildfire season, which compounds these
negative impacts. However, there may be many combinations of power lines whose
de-energization will result in about the same reduction of system-wide wildfire
risk, but the associated power outages affect different communities. Therefore,
one may raise concerns regarding the fairness of de-energization decisions.
Accordingly, this paper proposes a framework to select lines to de-energize in
order to balance wildfire risk reduction, total load shedding, and fairness
considerations. The goal of the framework is to prevent a small fraction of
communities from disproportionally being impacted by PSPS events, and to
instead more equally share the burden of power outages. For a geolocated test
case in the southwestern United States, we use actual California demand data as
well as real wildfire risk forecasts to simulate PSPS events during the 2021
wildfire season and compare the performance of various methods for promoting
fairness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed formulation can provide
significantly more fair outcomes with limited impacts on system-wide
performance.

precipitation and river flow time series. In these time series, the seasonal
hydroclimatic behaviour is represented by 3-month means of earth-observed
variables. In our analyses, we also adopt the well-established Koppen-Geiger
climate classification system and define continental-scale regions with large
or medium density of observational stations. In this context, we provide in
parallel seasonal hydroclimatic feature summaries and comparisons in terms of

more beneficial in water resources engineering contexts than the also provided
global summaries. Lastly, we apply explainable machine learning to compare the
investigated features with respect to how informative they are in explaining

which connect energy domains such as heat and electricity supply, expansion and
operational planning of so-called decentral multi-energy systems (DMES) holds a
multiplicity of complexities. This motivates the use of optimization problems,
which reach their limitations with regard to computational feasibility in
combination with the required level of detail. With an increased focus on DMES
implementation, this problem is aggravated since, moving away from the
traditional system perspective, a user-centered, market-integrated perspective
is assumed. Besides technical concepts it requires the consideration of market
regimes, e.g. self-consumption and the broader energy sharing. This highlights
the need for DMES optimization models which cover a microeconomic perspective
under consideration of detailed technical options and energy regulation, in
order to understand mutual technical and socio-economic and -ecologic

addresses technical aspects, as well as market and services coverage towards a

modelling level of detail and computational feasibility of DMES expansion and
operation optimization. Model detail is achieved by the application of a hybrid
combination of mathematical methods in a nested multi-level decomposition
approach, including a Genetic Algorithm, Benders Decomposition and Lagrange

  Sharing of Medical Data",,,,,"cs.GT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Though the sharing of medical data has the potential to lead to breakthroughs
in health care, the sharing process itself exposes patients and health care
providers to various risks. Patients face risks due to the possible loss in
privacy or livelihood that can occur when medical data is stolen or used in
non-permitted ways, whereas health care providers face risks due to the
associated liability. For medical data, these risks persist even after
anonymizing/deidentifying, according to the standards defined in existing
legislation, the data sets prior to sharing, because shared medical data can
often be deanonymized/reidentified using advanced artificial intelligence and
machine learning methodologies. As a result, health care providers are hesitant
to share medical data. One possible solution to encourage health care providers
to responsibly share data is through the use of cybersecurity insurance
contracts. This paper studies the problem of designing optimal cybersecurity
insurance contracts, with the goal of encouraging the sharing of the medical
data. We use a principal-agent model with moral hazard to model various
scenarios, derive the optimal contract, discuss its implications, and perform
numerical case studies. In particular, we consider two scenarios: the first
scenario is where a health care provider is selling medical data to a
technology firm who is developing an artificial intelligence algorithm using
the shared data. The second scenario is where a group of health care providers
share health data amongst themselves for the purpose of furthering medical
research using the aggregated medical data.

mutual information in the absence of interactions to the $D+1$'th order
equal-time density correlation function, which we show exhibits a universal
behavior in the long wavelength limit proportional to $\chi_F$. Our analytic
results are based on the replica method. In addition we perform a numerical
study of the charge-weighted mutual information for $D=2$ that confirms several

perturbatively within the replica theory. We show that for $D=3$ the $\log^3 L$
divergence of the topological mutual information is not perturbed by weak

traditional wind turbines and increase the total wind energy capacity.
Development of VAWT has been hampered by their low efficiency and structural
unreliability, which are related to the occurrence of dynamic stall. Dynamic
stall consists of the formation, growth, and shedding of large-scale dynamic
stall vortices, followed by massive flow separation. The vortex shedding is
detrimental to the turbine's efficiency and causes significant load
fluctuations that jeopardise the turbine's structural integrity. We present a
comprehensive experimental characterisation of dynamic stall on a VAWT blade
including time-resolved load and velocity field measurements. Particular
attention is dedicated to the dilemma faced by VAWT to either operate at lower
tip-speed ratios to maximise their peak aerodynamic performance but experience
dynamic stall, or to avoid dynamic stall at the cost of reducing their peak
performance. Based on the results, we map turbine operating conditions to one
of three regimes: deep stall, light stall, and no stall. The light stall regime
offers VAWT the best compromise in the dynamic stall dilemma as it yields
positive tangential forces during the upwind and downwind rotation and reduces
load transients by 75% compared to the deep stall regime.

However, the presence of interparticle interactions can profoundly affect the
topology of a material, invalidating the idealised formulation in terms of
Bloch waves. Despite pioneering experiments in solid state systems, photonic
waveguides, and optical lattices, the study of topological insulators under

experimentally realise a topological Thouless pump with tuneable Hubbard

well as an interaction-induced breakdown. We confirm the pump's robustness
against interactions that are smaller than the protecting gap, which holds true
for both repulsive and attractive Hubbard $U$. Furthermore, we identify that
bound pairs of fermions are responsible for quantised transport at strongly
attractive $U$, supported by measurements of pair fraction and adiabaticity.
For strong repulsive interactions, on the contrary, topological pumping breaks
down. Yet, we can reinstate quantised pumping by modifying the pump trajectory

compactifications in which the singularities can be unwound by passing through

substantial time. We find that the temporal evolution exhibits an approximate
universality that allows velocity-dependent models to be mapped onto
velocity-independent models in a well-defined way using the scattering
timescale computed when the halo achieves its minimum central density. We show
how this timescale depends on the halo parameters and an average cross section
computed at the central velocity dispersion when the central density is
minimum. The predicted collapse time is fully defined by the scattering
timescale, with negligible variation due to the velocity dependence of the
cross section. We derive new self-similar solutions that provide an analytic
understanding of the numerical results.

the promising prospect of treating quantum many-body systems with such

yet demonstrated the capacity to control the $\theta$-angle. Here, we
demonstrate how a tunable topological $\theta$-term can be added to a prototype

experimentally in a single-species Bose--Hubbard model in an optical

experimental resources. Through numerical calculations obtained from the
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method and exact
diagonalization, we benchmark the model system, and illustrate how salient
effects due to the $\theta$-term can be observed. These include charge
confinement, the weakening of quantum many-body scarring, as well as the
disappearance of Coleman's phase transition due to explicit breaking of CP

generally includes a $(3+1)$-dimensional manifold with two different geometries

of gravity, classically, and in the vacuum limit, the model reduces to two
massless gravity theories, thereby living ghost-free. The diffeomorphism
invariance and causality highly constrain the two metrics to be conformally
related, $\eta_{\mu \nu} = \phi^2 g_{\mu \nu}$. This reduces the theory to a
standard single-world description, but introduces a new inherently geometrical
""moir\'e field,"" $\phi$. Interestingly, the moir\'e field has the character of
both a dilaton and Higgs field familiar in the conventional theory. Integrating
out the moir\'e field naturally gives rise to the Starobinsky action and
inflationary dynamics. In the framework of the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker solution, we reduce an effective action for
the moir\'e field to that of a particle moving in a Mexican hat potential. The
equations of motion are then solved numerically and the moir\'e field is shown
to approach a Mexican-hat minimum in an oscillatory fashion, which is
accompanied by the decay of the Hubble parameter. Under additional reasonable
assumptions, the vacuum energy asymptotically approaches zero in the end of
inflationary evolution. The physics presented here shares similarities with the
moir\'e phenomena in condensed matter and elsewhere, where two similar

show strengths ranging from 40 kG to hundreds of MG, is still a topic of
debate. In contrast, only one magnetic hot subdwarf star has been identified
out of thousands of known systems. Hot subdwarfs are formed from binary
interaction, a process often associated with the generation of magnetic fields,
and will evolve to become white dwarfs, which makes the lack of detected
magnetic hot subdwarfs a puzzling phenomenon. Here we report the discovery of
three new magnetic hot subdwarfs with field strengths in the range 300-500 kG.
Like the only previously known system, they are all helium-rich O-type stars

variability, suggesting formation via a merger channel. However, we derive
higher than typical hydrogen abundances for their spectral type, which are in
disagreement with current model predictions. Our findings suggest a lower limit
to the magnetic fraction of hot subdwarfs of 0.147 (+0.143/-0.047) per cent,

fixed curved surfaces. We focus on the intrinsic geometry and show that
isothermal coordinates are particularly convenient as they explicitly encode a
geometric contribution to the elastic potential. In the special case of a cone
with half-angle $\beta$, the apex develops an effective topological charge of
$-\chi$, where $2\pi\chi = 2\pi(1-\sin\beta)$ is the deficit angle of the cone,
and a topological defect of charge $\sigma$ behaves as if it had an effective
topological charge $Q_\mathrm{eff} = (\sigma - \sigma^2/2)$ when interacting
with the apex. The effective charge of the apex leads to defect absorption and
emission at the cone apex as the deficit angle of the cone is varied.
  For total topological defect charge 1, e.g. imposed by tangential boundary
conditions at the edge, we find that for a disk the ground state configuration
consists of $p$ defects each of charge $+1/p$ lying equally spaced on a
concentric ring of radius $d = (\frac{p-1}{3p-1})^{\frac{1}{2p}} R$, where $R$
is the radius of the disk. In the case of a cone with tangential boundary
conditions at the base, we find three types of ground state configurations as a
function of cone angle: (1) for sharp cones, all of the $+1/p$ defects are
absorbed by the apex; (2) at intermediate cone angles, some of the $+1/p$
defects are absorbed by the apex and the rest lie equally spaced along a
concentric ring on the flank; and (3) for nearly flat cones, all of the $+1/p$
defects lie equally spaced along a concentric ring on the flank. Here the
defect positions and the absorption transitions depend intricately on $p$ and
the deficit angle which we analytically compute. We check these results with
numerical simulations for a set of commensurate cone angles and find excellent
agreement.

enclosing two different overdensities, provides a non-parametric proxy of the
halo mass distribution which has been shown to be a sensitive probe of the
cosmological imprint encoded in the mass profile of haloes hosting galaxy
clusters. Mass estimations at several overdensities would allow for multiple
sparsity measurements, that can potentially retrieve the entirety of the
cosmological information imprinted on the halo profile. Here, we investigate
the impact of multiple sparsity measurements on the cosmological model
parameter inference. For this purpose, we analyse N-body halo catalogues from
the Raygal and M2Csims simulations and evaluate the correlations among six
different sparsities from Spherical Overdensity halo masses at
$\Delta=200,500,1000$ and $2500$ (in units of the critical density).
Remarkably, sparsities associated to distinct halo mass shells are not highly
correlated. This is not the case for sparsities obtained using halo masses
estimated from the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) best-fit profile, that
artificially correlates different sparsities to order one. This implies that
there is additional information in the mass profile beyond the NFW
parametrization and that it can be exploited with multiple sparsities. In
particular, from a likelihood analysis of synthetic average sparsity data, we
show that cosmological parameter constraints significantly improve when
increasing the number of sparsity combinations, though the constraints saturate
beyond four sparsity estimates. We forecast constraints for the CHEX-MATE
cluster sample and find that systematic mass bias errors mildly impact the
parameter inference, though more studies are needed in this direction.

  Pages, 4 Figures, 1 Table",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, several studies involving open quantum systems which possess a
strong symmetry have observed that every individual trajectory in the Monte
Carlo unravelling of the master equation will dynamically select a specific
symmetry sector to freeze into in the long-time limit. This phenomenon has been
termed dissipative freezing, and in this paper we argue, by presenting several
simple mathematical perspectives on the problem, that it is a general
consequence of the presence of a strong symmetry in an open system with only a
few exceptions. Using a number of example systems we illustrate these
arguments, uncovering an explicit relationship between the spectral properties
of the Liouvillian in off-diagonal symmetry sectors and the time it takes for
freezing to occur. In the limiting case that eigenmodes with purely imaginary
eigenvalues are manifest in these sectors, freezing fails to occur. Such modes
indicate the preservation of information and coherences between symmetry
sectors of the system and can lead to phenomena such as non-stationarity and
synchronisation. The absence of freezing at the level of a single quantum
trajectory provides a simple, computationally efficient way of identifying
these traceless modes.

experimental evidence of confinement and deconfinement can be obtained by
measuring whether a physical charge is localized around a fixed gauge charge to

which is equivalent to the lattice Schwinger model when all local gauge charges
are fixed as zero. Although the gauge charges are fixed, we can alternatively
probe the confinement and the deconfinement in the PXP model by studying the
relative motion of a pair of a physical charge and an anti-charge. Our scheme
can be directly implemented in these two relevant experimental platforms of
ultracold atom quantum simulators.

fermionic topological orders (FTOs). In this work, we propose a systematic
approach to obtain the gapped boundaries of $2+1$D abelian FTOs. The main trick
is to construct a bosonic extension in which the fermionic excitation is
""condensed"" to form the associated FTOs. Here we choose the parent bosonic
topological order to be the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order, which indeed has
a fermionic excitation. Such a construction allows us to find an explicit
correspondence between abelian FTOs (described by odd $K$-matrix $K_F$) and the
""fermion-"" condensed $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders (described by even
$K$-matrix $K_B$). This provides a systematic algorithm to obtain the modular
covariant boundary partition functions as well as the boundary topological
excitations of abelian FTOs. For example, the $\nu=1-\frac{1}{m}$ Laughlin's
states have exactly one type of gapped boundary when $m$ is a square, whose
boundary excitations form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{\sqrt{m}}$ fusion
ring. Our approach can be easily generalized to obtain gapped and gapless
boundaries of non-abelian fermionic topological orders.

  on correlated noise properties","Submitted to Medical Physics",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Filtered back projection algorithms for voxel-based CT image
reconstruction have noise properties defined by the filter. Iterative
algorithms must stop at some point in their convergence and do not necessarily
produce consistent noise properties for images with different degrees of
heterogeneity. Purpose: A least-squares iterative algorithm for pCT image
reconstruction converges toward a unique solution that optimally fits the
protons. We present a stopping criterion that delivers solutions with the
property that correlations of RSP noise between voxels are relatively low. This
provides a method to produce pCT images with consistent noise properties useful
for proton therapy treatment planning, which relies on summing RSP along
columns of voxels. Consistent noise properties will also be useful for future
studies of image quality using metrics such as contrast to noise ratio, and to
compare RSP noise and dose of pCT with other modalities such as dual-energy CT.
With simulated and real images with varying heterogeneity from a prototype
clinical proton imaging system, we calculate average RSP correlations between
voxel pairs in uniform regions-of-interest versus distance between voxels. We
define a parameter r, the remaining distance to the unique solution relative to
estimated RSP noise, and our stopping criterion is based on r falling below a
chosen value. Results: We find large correlations between voxels for larger
values of r, and anticorrelations for smaller values. For r in the range of 0.5
to 1, voxels are relatively uncorrelated, and compared to smaller values of r
have lower noise with only slight loss of spatial resolution. Conclusions: A
least-squares iterative algorithm with an r-based stopping criterion defines a
pCT image reconstruction method with consistent statistical properties optimal
for clinical use, including for treatment planning with pCT images.

debated. Here we investigate superconducting pairing in the

reduced, the leading eigenvalue increases upon approaching Tc, reaching a value
of approximately 1 at the Tc corresponding to each doping value, indicating a
superconducting transition with d-wave eigenfunctions. This suggests that spin
fluctuations can approximately account for Tc and, consequently, mediate

rewards learned from preferences achieve minimal test error but fail to

all exacerbate reward misidentification. We also identify a set of methods with
which to interpret misidentified learned rewards. In general, we observe that
optimizing misidentified rewards drives the policy off the reward's training
distribution, resulting in high predicted (learned) rewards but low true

reward misidentification and causal confusion -- failure to consider even one

point at $p\in M^n_{\mbox{sing}}$ we define up to $l(n-1)$ different axial
curvatures at $p$, where $l=\min\{n,k+1\}$. These curvatures are obtained using
the curvature locus (the image by the second fundamental form of the unitary
tangent vectors) and are therefore second order invariants. In fact, in the
case $n=2$ they generalise all second order curvatures which have been defined
for frontal type surfaces. We relate these curvatures with the principal
curvatures in certain normal directions of an associated regular
$(n-1)$-manifold contained in $M^n_{\mbox{sing}}$. We obtain many interesting
geometrical interpretations in the cases $n=2,3$. For instance, for frontal
type 3-manifolds with 2-dimensional singular set, the Gaussian curvature of the
singular set can be expressed in terms of the axial curvatures. Similarly for
the curvature of the singular set when it is 1-dimensional. Finally, we show
that all the umbilic curvatures which have been defined for singular manifolds
up to now can be seen as the absolute value of one of our axial curvatures.

in AR/VR, human-machine interaction, as well as medical applications. Most of
these applications rely on a metrically correct prediction of the shape,
especially, when the reconstructed subject is put into a metrical context
(i.e., when there is a reference object of known size). A metrical
reconstruction is also needed for any application that measures distances and
dimensions of the subject (e.g., to virtually fit a glasses frame).
State-of-the-art methods for face reconstruction from a single image are
trained on large 2D image datasets in a self-supervised fashion. However, due
to the nature of a perspective projection they are not able to reconstruct the
actual face dimensions, and even predicting the average human face outperforms
some of these methods in a metrical sense. To learn the actual shape of a face,
we argue for a supervised training scheme. Since there exists no large-scale 3D
dataset for this task, we annotated and unified small- and medium-scale
databases. The resulting unified dataset is still a medium-scale dataset with
more than 2k identities and training purely on it would lead to overfitting. To
this end, we take advantage of a face recognition network pretrained on a
large-scale 2D image dataset, which provides distinct features for different
faces and is robust to expression, illumination, and camera changes. Using
these features, we train our face shape estimator in a supervised fashion,
inheriting the robustness and generalization of the face recognition network.
Our method, which we call MICA (MetrIC fAce), outperforms the state-of-the-art
reconstruction methods by a large margin, both on current non-metric benchmarks
as well as on our metric benchmarks (15% and 24% lower average error on NoW,
respectively).

Morgan fingerprints and pre-training SMILES embeddings. A multi-task deep

adapt a post-hoc contrastive explanation method that returns pertinent positive

and a subject/soft band (2.1 - 5.7 keV) to obtain, using a novel technique, the

decrease with increasing luminosity. We found that for both the atoll and Z

This involves interpreting instructions executed by software and often

The conversion process requires information about the binary file's target
instruction set architecture (ISA). However, ISA information might not be
included in binary files due to compilation errors, partial downloads, or
adversarial corruption of file metadata. Machine learning (ML) is a promising
methodology that can be used to identify the target ISA using binary data in
the object code section of binary files. In this paper we propose a binary code
feature extraction model to improve the accuracy and scalability of ML-based
ISA identification methods. Our feature extraction model can be used in the
absence of domain knowledge about the ISAs. Specifically, we adapt models from
natural language processing (NLP) to i) identify successive byte patterns
commonly observed in binary codes, ii) estimate the significance of each byte
pattern to a binary file, and iii) estimate the relevance of each byte pattern
in distinguishing between ISAs. We introduce character-level features of
encoded binaries to identify fine-grained bit patterns inherent to each ISA. We
use a dataset with binaries from 12 different ISAs to evaluate our approach.
Empirical evaluations show that using our byte-level features in ML-based ISA
identification results in an 8% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
features based on byte-histograms and byte pattern signatures. We observe that
character-level features allow reducing the size of the feature set by up to

well-generalized model. However, it induces large memory and inference costs,
which are often not affordable for real-world deployment. Existing work has
resorted to sharing weights among models. However, when increasing the
proportion of the shared weights, the resulting models tend to be similar, and
the benefits of using model ensemble diminish. To retain ensemble benefits
while maintaining a low memory cost, we propose a consistency-regularized
ensemble learning approach based on perturbed models, named CAMERO.
Specifically, we share the weights of bottom layers across all models and apply
different perturbations to the hidden representations for different models,
which can effectively promote the model diversity. Meanwhile, we apply a
prediction consistency regularizer across the perturbed models to control the
variance due to the model diversity. Our experiments using large language

object segmentation (VOS) tasks by storing every-k frames in an external memory
bank for future inference. Storing the intermediate frames' predictions
provides the network with richer cues for segmenting an object in the current
frame. However, the size of the memory bank gradually increases with the length
of the video, which slows down inference speed and makes it impractical to
handle arbitrary length videos.
  This paper proposes an adaptive memory bank strategy for matching-based
networks for semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) that can handle
videos of arbitrary length by discarding obsolete features. Features are
indexed based on their importance in the segmentation of the objects in
previous frames. Based on the index, we discard unimportant features to
accommodate new features. We present our experiments on DAVIS 2016, DAVIS 2017,
and Youtube-VOS that demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art

achieves comparable performance to the every-k strategy with increasing-sized

the last few years. One of them is VVV CL001, the subject of the present study.
We present a new spectroscopic analysis of the recently confirmed globular
cluster VVV CL001, made by means of MUSE@VLT integral field data. Individual
spectra were extracted for stars in the VVV CL001 field. Radial velocities were
derived by cross-correlation with synthetic templates. Coupled with PMs from
the VVV survey, these data allow us to select 55 potential cluster members, for
which we derive metallicities using the public code The Cannon. The mean radial
velocity of the cluster is Vhelio = -324.9 +- 0.8 km/s,as estimated from 55
cluster members. This high velocity, together with a low metallicity [Fe/H] =
-2.04 +- 0.02 dex suggests that VVV CL001 could be a very old cluster. The
estimated distance is d = 8.23 +- 0.46 kpc, placing the cluster in the Galactic

descriptions of neural dynamics have led to profound insights into possible

apply to spiking networks and thus allow one to characterize the dynamic
properties of biologically more realistic networks. Here, we build on recent
work by van Meegen & Lindner who have shown that ""rotator networks,"" while
considerably simpler than real spiking networks and therefore more amenable to
mathematical analysis, still allow to capture dynamical properties of networks
of spiking neurons. This framework can be easily extended to the case where
individual units receive uncorrelated stochastic input which can be interpreted
as intrinsic noise. However, the assumptions of the theory do not apply anymore
when the input received by the single rotators is strongly correlated among
units. As we show, in this case the network fluctuations become significantly
non-Gaussian, which calls for a reworking of the theory. Using a cumulant
expansion, we develop a self-consistent analytical theory that accounts for the
observed non-Gaussian statistics. Our theory provides a starting point for
further studies of more general network setups and information transmission
properties of these networks.

Likelihood calculations for the recurrent event analysis, however, become

reduced by increasing the sampling rate; however, this leads to increased

Additionally, we show that if $\textsf{RP} = \textsf{NP}$ then there would
exist efficient proper learning algorithms for CNOT and Clifford circuits. By
similar arguments, we also find that an efficient proper quantum learner for

Interestingly, the bulk-polarization can topologically characterize the dipolar

symmetry is preserved. The effective gap criterion can qualitatively mimic the
extent of SOT phase originated by the interplay between finite Zeeman exchange

Wasserstein space, then uses pairwise Wasserstein distances between the
associated measures to produce a low-dimensional, approximately isometric
embedding. We show that the algorithm is able to exactly recover parameters of
some image manifolds including those generated by translations or dilations of
a fixed generating measure. Additionally, we show that a discrete version of
the algorithm retrieves parameters from manifolds generated from discrete
measures by providing a theoretical bridge to transfer recovery results from

giant planets. The inner planet transits its host star. The planets travel on
eccentric orbits and are near the 4:1 mean-motion resonance, which implies
significant mutual gravitational interactions. In particular, this causes
transit-timing variations of a few minutes, which were detected based on
ground-based photometry. This made WASP-148 one of the few cases where such a
phenomenon was detected without space-based photometry. Here, we present a
self-consistent model of WASP-148 that takes into account the gravitational
interactions between all known bodies in the system. Our analysis
simultaneously fits the available radial velocities and transit light curves.
In particular, we used the photometry secured by the TESS space telescope and
made public after the WASP-148 discovery announcement. The TESS data confirm
the transit-timing variations, but only in combination with previously measured
transit times. The system parameters we derived agree with those previously
reported and have a significantly improved precision, including the mass of the
non-transiting planet. We found a significant mutual inclination between the
orbital planes of the two planets: I=41.0 +6.2 -7.6 deg based on the modelling
of the observations, although we found I=20.8 +/- 4.6 deg when we imposed a
constraint on the model enforcing long-term dynamical stability. When a third
planet was added to the model - based on a candidate signal in the radial
velocity - the mutual inclination between planets b and c changed significantly
allowing solutions closer to coplanar. We conclude that more data are needed to
establish the true architecture of the system. If the significant mutual
inclination is confirmed, WASP-148 would become one of the only few candidate
non-coplanar planetary systems. We discuss possible origins for this
misalignment.

trees (BART) to flexibly specify separate models for the potential outcomes and

acute lung injuries on the outcome of time to returning home, but substantial
heterogeneity in treatment effects among the always-survivors, driven most
strongly by sex and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient at baseline (a
physiologic measure of lung function and source of hypoxemia). These findings
illustrate how the proposed methodology could guide the prognostic enrichment
of future trials in the field. We also demonstrated through a simulation study
that our proposed Bayesian machine learning approach outperforms other
parametric methods in reducing the estimation bias in both the average causal
effect and heterogeneous causal effects for always-survivors.

carry away excess angular momentum from the inner disk surface, allowing the
material to be transferred toward the central protostar. Theoretically, low
velocity and poorly collimated outflows appear from the beginning of the
collapse, at the first hydrostatic core (FHSC) stage. With growing protostellar
core mass, high-density jets are launched which entrain an outflow from the
infalling envelope. Until now, molecular jets have been observed at high
velocity ($\gtrsim$ 100 km/s) in early Class\,0 protostars. We, for the first
time, detect a dense molecular jet in SiO emission with small-velocity ($\sim$
4.2 km\,s$^{-1}$, deprojected $\sim$ 24 km\,s$^{-1}$) from source
G208.89-20.04Walma (hereafter, G208Walma) using ALMA Band\,6 observations. This
object has some characteristics of FHSCs, such as a small outflow/jet velocity,
extended 1.3\,mm continuum emission, and N$_2$D$^+$ line emission. Additional
characteristics, however, are typical of early protostars: collimated outflow
and SiO jet. The full extent of the outflow corresponds to a dynamical time
scale of $\sim$ 930$^{+200}_{-100}$ years. The spectral energy distribution
also suggests a very young source having an upper limit of T$_{bol}$ $\sim$ 31
K and L$_{bol}$ $\sim$ 0.8 L$_\sun$. We conclude that G208Walma is likely in
the transition phase from FHSC to protostar, and the molecular jet has been
launched within a few hundred years of initial collapse. Therefore, G208Walma
may be the earliest object discovered in the protostellar phase with a
molecular jet.

light elements in cosmic rays, in particular, of primary H plus He nuclei, is
reported. The spectrum is presented in the energy range from $6$ to $158$ TeV
per nucleus. Data was collected with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
Observatory between June 2015 and June 2019. The analysis was based on a
Bayesian unfolding procedure, which was applied on a subsample of vertical HAWC
data that was enriched to $82\%$ of events induced by light nuclei. To achieve
the mass separation, a cut on the lateral age of air shower data was set guided
by predictions of CORSIKA/QGSJET-II-04 simulations. The measured spectrum is
consistent with a broken power-law spectrum and shows a kneelike feature at
around $E = 24.0^{+3.6}_{-3.1} $ TeV, with a spectral index $\gamma = -2.51 \pm
0.02$ before the break and with $\gamma = -2.83 \pm 0.02$ above it. The feature
has a statistical significance of $4.1 \, \sigma$. Within systematic
uncertainties, the significance of the spectral break is $0.8 \, \sigma$.

iterative solver of Finite Element Methods on computer simulation. Since the
SpMV operation is a memory-bound algorithm, the efficiency of data movements
heavily influenced the performance of the SpMV on GPU. In recent years, many
research is conducted in accelerating the performance of SpMV on the graphic
processing units (GPU). The performance optimization methods used in existing
studies focus on the following areas: improve the load balancing between GPU
processors, and reduce the execution divergence between GPU threads. Although
some studies have made preliminary optimization on the input vector fetching,
the effect of explicitly caching the input vector on GPU base SpMV has not been
studied in depth yet. In this study, we are trying to minimize the data
movements cost for GPU-based SpMV using a new framework named ""explicit caching
Hybrid (EHYB)"". The EHYB framework achieved significant performance improvement
by using the following methods: 1. Improve the speed of data movements by
partitioning and explicitly caching the input vector to the shared memory of
the CUDA kernel. 2. Reduce the volume of data movements by storing the major
part of the column index with a compact format. We tested our implementation
with sparse matrices derived from FEM applications in different areas. The
experiment results show that our implementation can overperform the
state-of-the-arts implementation with significant speedup, and leads to higher
FLOPs than the theoryperformance up-boundary of the existing GPU-based SpMV
implementations.

having to declare a Schema that imposes a structure. This schemaless feature
offers flexibility to evolve data-intensive applications when data frequently
change. However, freeing from declaring schemas does not mean their absence,
but rather that they are implicit in data and code. Therefore, diagramming
tools similar to those available for relational systems are also needed to help
developers and administrators understanding NoSQL schemas.
  Visualizing diagrams is not practical if schemas contain hundreds of database
entities, and exploration or query facilities are then needed. In schemaless
NoSQL stores, data of the same entity can be stored with different structure
which can increase the difficulty of having readable diagrams.
  NoSQL schema management tools should therefore have three main components:
schema extraction, schema visualization, and schema query. Since that there
exist four main NoSQL data models, it is convenient that such tools can be
built on a generic data model that provide platform-independence to query and
visualize schemas. With the aim of favoring the creation of generic database
tools, the authors of this paper defined the U-Schema unified data model that
integrates the four main NoSQL data models and the relational model.
  This paper is focused on querying NoSQL and relational schemas which are
represented as U-Schema models. We present the SkiQL language designed on
U-Schema to achieve a platform-independent schema query service. SkiQL provides
two constructs: schema-query and relationship-query. The former allows to
obtain information of entity or relationship types, and the latter that of the
aggregations or references (relations among types). We will show how SkiQL was
evaluated by calculating well-known metrics for languages and using a survey.

decomposition with respect to the four-velocity of the continuum which is
different from the foliation-based Arnowitt-Deser-Misner one. Our thread-based

possible to systematically find invariant building blocks of the EFT for each

demodulate the received signal and get the instantaneous bit error probability
(BEP) of a mm-wave UAV A2G link under imperfect CSI. Based on the designed
detectors, we propose an adaptive modulation scheme to maximize the average
transmission rate under imperfect CSI by optimizing the data transmission time
subject to the maximum tolerable BEP. A power control policy is in conjunction
with adaptive modulation to minimize the transmission power while maintaining
both the BEP under the threshold and the maximized average transmission rate.
Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive modulation scheme in
conjunction with the power control policy could maximize the temporally
averaged transmission rate, while saves as much as 50\% energy.

  The first work deals with interpretation of a 2D-line drawing as a graph
structure, and also illustrates its effectiveness through its physical
reconstruction by a robot. We setup a two-step pipeline to solve the problem.
Formerly, we estimate the vertices of the graph with sub-pixel level accuracy.
We achieve this using a combination of deep convolutional neural networks
learned under a supervised setting for pixel-level estimation followed by the
connected component analysis for clustering. Later we follow it up with a
feedback-loop-based edge estimation method. To complement the
graph-interpretation, we further perform data-interchange to a robot legible
ASCII format, and thus teach a robot to replicate a line drawing.
  In the second work, we test the 3D-geometric understanding of a sketch-based
system without explicit access to the information about 3D-geometry. The
objective is to complete a contour-like sketch of a 3D-object, with
illumination and texture information. We propose a data-driven approach to
learn a conditional distribution modelled as deep convolutional neural networks
to be trained under an adversarial setting; and we validate it against a
human-in-the-loop. The method itself is further supported by synthetic data
generation using constructive solid geometry following a standard graphics
pipeline. In order to validate the efficacy of our method, we design a
user-interface plugged into a popular sketch-based workflow, and setup a simple
task-based exercise, for an artist. Thereafter, we also discover that
form-exploration is an additional utility of our application.

topology, and an optimal set of microstructures at a smaller scale, for a
physics-constrained problem. With the advent of additive manufacturing, M-TO
has gained significant prominence. However, generating optimal microstructures
at various locations can be computationally very expensive. As an alternate,
graded multiscale topology optimization (GM-TO) has been proposed where one or
more pre-selected and graded (parameterized) microstructural topologies are
used to fill the domain optimally. This leads to a significant reduction in
computation while retaining many of the benefits of M-TO.
  A successful GM-TO framework must: (1) be capable of efficiently handling
numerous pre-selected microstructures, (2) be able to continuously switch
between these microstructures during optimization, (3) ensure that the
partition of unity is satisfied, and (4) discourage microstructure mixing at
termination.
  In this paper, we propose to meet these requirements by exploiting the unique
classification capacity of neural networks. Specifically, we propose a graded
multiscale topology optimization using neural-network (GM-TOuNN) framework with
the following features: (1) the number of design variables is only weakly
dependent on the number of pre-selected microstructures, (2) it guarantees
partition of unity while discouraging microstructure mixing, and (3) it
supports automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity
analysis. The proposed framework is illustrated through several examples.

chirality, but it has never been demonstrated on disordered samples.
Furthermore, in the optical domain the challenge lies in the need to transfer
the OAM of the photon to an electron that is localized on an {\AA}-size

non-additive metrics that allows for the identification and interpretation of
contributing factors (input features) of variance. Non-additive metrics, such
as ratios, are widely used in a variety of domains. It commonly requires
preceding aggregations of underlying variables that are used to calculate the
metric of interest. The latest poses a dimensionality challenge when the input
features and underlying variables are formed as two-dimensional arrays along
elements, such as account or customer identifications, and time points. It
rules out direct modeling of the time series of a non-additive metric as a
function of input features. The article discusses a five-step approach: (1)
segmentations of input features and the underlying variables of the metric that
are supported by unsupervised autoencoders, (2) univariate or joint fittings of
the metric by the aggregated input features on the segmented domains, (3)
transformations of pre-screened input features according to the fitted models,
(4) aggregation of the transformed features as time series, and (5) modelling
of the metric time series as a sum of constrained linear effects of the
aggregated features. Alternatively, approximation by numerical differentiation
has been considered to linearize the metric. It allows for element level
univariate or joint modeling of step (2). The process of these analytical steps
allows for a backward-looking explanatory decomposition of the metric as a sum
of time series of the survived input features. The paper includes a synthetic
example that studies loss-to-balance monthly rates of a hypothetical retail
credit portfolio. To validate that no latent factors other than the survived
input features have significant impacts on the metric, Statistical Process
Control has been introduced for the residual time series.

We experimentally investigate the strategy for the optimal discrimination of
two non-orthogonal states considering a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes
(FRIO). The main advantage of the FRIO strategy is to interpolate between
unambiguous and minimum error discrimination by solely adjusting the rate of
inconclusive outcomes. We present a versatile experimental scheme that performs
the optimal FRIO measurement for any pair of generated non-orthogonal states
with arbitrary a priori probabilities and for any fixed rate of inconclusive
outcomes. Considering different values of the free parameters in the FRIO
protocol, we implement it upon qubit states encoded in the polarization mode of
single photons generated in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process.
Moreover, we resort to a newfangled double-path Sagnac interferometer to
perform a three-outcome non-projective measurement required for the
discrimination task, showing excellent agreement with the theoretical
prediction. This experiment provides a practical toolbox for a wide range of
quantum state discrimination strategies using the FRIO scheme, which can

observations of the dust shadow in scattered light from Debes et al. (2017)
suggests that an oscillatory motion would provide a better model of the
temporal evolution of the dust shadow rather than orbital motion. Both models
predict an angular offset between the dust shadow and the gas shadow of up to
~100 deg. We attribute this offset to the finite rate at which dust grains and
gas molecules can exchange heat, dominated by the collisional rate between gas
molecules and dust grains, $t_{\rm coll}$. The angular offsets derived are
equivalent to collisional timescales that range from the near instantaneous up
to $t_{\rm coll}$ ~ 10 years, depending on whether a straight or a curved dust
shadow, as suggested by HST observations reported by Debes et al. (2017), is
adopted. The inferred range of $t_{\rm coll}$ are consistent with those

  Series Data","14 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Anomaly detection for indoor air quality (IAQ) data has become an important
area of research as the quality of air is closely related to human health and
well-being. However, traditional statistics and shallow machine learning-based
approaches in anomaly detection in the IAQ area could not detect anomalies
involving the observation of correlations across several data points (i.e.,
often referred to as long-term dependences). We propose a hybrid deep learning
model that combines LSTM with Autoencoder for anomaly detection tasks in IAQ to
address this issue. In our approach, the LSTM network is comprised of multiple
LSTM cells that work with each other to learn the long-term dependences of the
data in a time-series sequence. Autoencoder identifies the optimal threshold
based on the reconstruction loss rates evaluated on every data across all
time-series sequences. Our experimental results, based on the Dunedin CO2
time-series dataset obtained through a real-world deployment of the schools in
New Zealand, demonstrate a very high and robust accuracy rate (99.50%) that
outperforms other similar models.

has been extensively utilized in power electronics, radiofrequency amplifiers,

enabling desired deep-ultraviolet emission, excitonic impact, and electronic
transport features, two-dimensional (2D) or ultrathin quasi-2D GaN
semiconductors have been one of the most remarkable candidates for future
growth of microelectronic devices. Here, for the first time, we reported a
large area, wide bandgap, and room-temperature quasi-2D GaN synthesis and
printing strategy through introducing the plasma medicated liquid metal gallium
surface-confined nitridation reaction mechanism. The developed direct
fabrication and compositional process is consistent with various electronics
manufacturing approaches and thus opens an easy going way for cost-effective
growth of the third-generation semiconductor. In particular, the fully printed
field-effect transistors relying on the GaN thus made show p-type switching
with an on/off ratio greater than 105, maximum field-effect hole mobility of 53
cm2/(V*s), and a small sub-threshold swing. As it was demonstrated, the present
method allows to produce at room temperature the GaN with thickness spanning
from 1nm to nanometers. This basic method can be further extended, generalized,
and utilized for making various electronic and photoelectronic devices in the

activities in local area networks (LANs). Various aspects of LAN anomaly
detection have been widely studied. Nonetheless, the privacy concern about
individual users or their relationship in LAN has not been thoroughly explored
in the prior work. In some realistic cases, the anomaly detection analysis
needs to be carried out by an external party, located outside the LAN. Thus, it
is important for the LAN admin to release LAN data to this party in a private
way in order to protect privacy of LAN users; at the same time, the released
data must also preserve the utility of being able to detect anomalies. This
paper investigates the possibility of privately releasing ARP data that can
later be used to identify anomalies in LAN. We present four approaches and show
that they satisfy different levels of differential privacy - a rigorous and

proper privacy budget, all of our approaches preserve more than 75% utility of

severely degrades the performance of the hybrid beamforming (HBF). In this
work, to mitigate the detrimental effect of the reciprocity mismatch, we
investigate reciprocity calibration for the mmWave-HBF system with a
fully-connected phase shifter network. To reduce the overhead and computational
complexity of reciprocity calibration, we first decouple digital radio
frequency (RF) chains and analog RF chains with beamforming design. Then, the
entire calibration problem of the HBF system is equivalently decomposed into
two subproblems corresponding to the digital-chain calibration and analog-chain
calibration. To solve the calibration problems efficiently, a closed-form
solution to the digital-chain calibration problem is derived, while an
iterative-alternating optimization algorithm for the analog-chain calibration
problem is proposed. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithm, we
derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the errors in estimating mismatch
coefficients. The results reveal that the estimation errors of mismatch
coefficients of digital and analog chains are uncorrelated, and that the
mismatch coefficients of receive digital chains can be estimated perfectly.
Simulation results are presented to validate the analytical results and to show
the performance of the proposed calibration approach.

and subsequent evolution of a USSN surrounded by such a CSM environment. We
find that the CSM encompasses an extended region characterized by a hot plasma
with a temperature $\sim 10^8\,$K located around the termination shock of the
wind from the progenitor binary ($\sim 10\,$pc), and the USSNR blastwave is
drastically weakened while penetrating through this hot plasma. Radio continuum
emission from a young USSNR is sufficiently bright to be detectable if it
inhabits our Galaxy but faint compared to the observed Galactic SNRs, and
thereafter declines in luminosity through adiabatic cooling. Within our
parameter space, USSNRs typically exhibit a low radio luminosity and surface
brightness compared to the known Galactic SNRs. Due to the small event rate of
USSNe and their relatively short observable lifespan, we calculate that USSNRs
account for only $\sim 0.1$-$1$ % of the total SNR population. This is
consistent with the fact that no SNR hosting a DNS binary has been discovered
in the Milky Way so far.

piezoelectric ferromagnetism (PFM), is crucial to advance multifunctional

is a PFM, which is dynamically, mechanically and thermally stable. Electronic
correlation effects on physical properties of YBrI are investigated by using
generalized gradient approximation plus $U$ (GGA+$U$) approach. For
out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, YBrI is a ferrovalley (FV) material, and the
valley splitting is larger than 82 meV in considered $U$ range. The anomalous
valley Hall effect (AVHE) can be achieved under an in-plane electric field.
However, for in-plane magnetic anisotropy, YBrI is a common ferromagnetic (FM)
semiconductor. When considering intrinsic magnetic anisotropy, the easy axis of
YBrI is always in-plane with magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) from 0.309 meV to
0.237 meV ($U$=0.0 eV to 3.0 eV). However, the magnetization can be adjusted
from the in-plane to off-plane direction by external magnetic field, and then
lead to the occurrence of valley polarization. Moreover, missing centrosymmetry
along with mirror symmetry breaking results in both in-plane and out-of-plane
piezoelectricity in YBrI monolayer. At a typical $U$=2.0 eV, the $d_{11}$ is
predicted to be -5.61 pm/V, which is higher than or compared with ones of other
two-dimensional (2D) known materials. The electronic and piezoelectric
properties of YBrI can be effectively tuned by applying a biaxial strain. For
example, tensile strain can enhance valley splitting and $d_{11}$ (absolute
value). The predicted Curie temperature of YBrI is higher than those of
experimentally synthesized 2D ferromagnetic materials $\mathrm{CrI_3}$ and
$\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$.

2.0. The results indicate that incorporating functional annotation data using
GGPA 2.0 does not only improve detection of disease-associated variants, but
also allows to identify more accurate relationships among diseases. We analyzed
five autoimmune diseases and five psychiatric disorders with the functional
annotations derived from GenoSkyline and GenoSkyline-Plus and the prior disease
graph generated by biomedical literature mining. For autoimmune diseases, GGPA
2.0 identified enrichment for blood, especially B cells and regulatory T cells

identified the pleiotropy between BIP and SCZ. These results demonstrate that
GGPA 2.0 can be a powerful tool to identify associated variants associated with

understanding of functional mechanisms underlying the associated variants.

for quantum channels in this setting. We show that the notion of
\textit{convex} Kraus-like operator decompositions (in which the coefficients
in the sum decomposition are nonnegative and satisfy a sum rule) that are
induced by the irreducible characters of a finite group is equivalent to the
notion of a conditionally negative-definite length when the length is a class
function. For a general finite group $G$, we prove a stability condition which
shows that if the semigroup associated with a length has a convex Kraus-like
operator decomposition for all $t>0$ small enough, then it has a convex
Kraus-like operator decomposition for all time $t>0$. Using the stability
condition, we show that for a general finite group, conditional negativity of
the length function is equivalent to a set of semidefinite linear constraints
on the length function. By a result of \cite{Sch}, our result implies that in
the group algebra setting, a semigroup $P_t$ induced by a length function which
is a class function is a quantum channel for all $t\geq 0$ if and only if it
possesses a convex Kraus-like operator decomposition for all $t>0$.

asymmetry -- and thus of causation -- in fundamental physical theories. I argue
that this is incorrect: the ubiquitous generation of entanglement between
quantum systems grounds a relevant asymmetry in the dynamical evolution of
quantum systems. I show that by exploiting a connection between the amount of
entanglement in a quantum state and the algorithmic complexity of that state,
one can use recently developed tools for causal inference to identify a causal

include finite difference, finite elements and finite volume methods. Such

subgrid-scale heterogeneity or nonlinearities. We provide a new algebraic route
to systematically approximate, in principle exactly, the macroscale closure of
the spatially-discrete dynamics of a general class of heterogeneous
non-autonomous reaction-advection-diffusion PDEs. This holistic discretisation
approach, developed through rigorous theory and verified with computer algebra,
systematically constructs discrete macroscale models through physics informed
by the PDE out-of-equilibrium dynamics, thus relaxing many assumptions
regarding the subgrid structure. The construction is analogous to recent
gray-box machine learning techniques in that predictions are directed by
iterative layers (as in neural networks), but informed by the subgrid physics
(or 'data') as expressed in the PDEs. A major development of the holistic
methodology, presented herein, is novel inter-element coupling between subgrid
fields which preserve self-adjointness of the PDE after macroscale
discretisation, thereby maintaining the spectral structure of the original
system. This holistic methodology also encompasses homogenisation of microscale

necessary to monitor changes in the forest structure and function, which are
key data in natural resources research. Although accurate forest biomass
measurements are important in forest inventory and assessments, high-density
measurements that involve airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) at a low
flight height in large mountainous areas are highly expensive. The objective of
this study was to quantify the aboveground biomass (AGB) of a plateau
mountainous forest reserve using a system that synergistically combines an
unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based digital aerial camera and LiDAR to
leverage their complementary advantages. In this study, we utilized digital
aerial photogrammetry (DAP), which has the unique advantages of speed, high
spatial resolution, and low cost, to compensate for the deficiency of forestry
inventory using UAS-based LiDAR that requires terrain-following flight for
high-resolution data acquisition. Combined with the sparse LiDAR points
acquired by using a high-altitude and high-speed UAS for terrain extraction,
dense normalized DAP point clouds can be obtained to produce an accurate and
high-resolution canopy height model (CHM). Based on the CHM and spectral
attributes obtained from multispectral images, we estimated and mapped the AGB
of the region of interest with considerable cost efficiency. Our study supports
the development of predictive models for large-scale wall-to-wall AGB mapping
by leveraging the complementarity between DAP and LiDAR measurements. This work
also reveals the potential of utilizing a UAS-based digital camera and LiDAR

Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. While sequence-to-sequence-based
auto-regressive (AR) approaches are common for conversational semantic parsing,
recent studies employ non-autoregressive (NAR) decoders and reduce inference
latency while maintaining competitive parsing quality. However, a major
drawback of NAR decoders is the difficulty of generating top-k (i.e., k-best)
outputs with approaches such as beam search. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel NAR semantic parser that introduces intent conditioning on the
decoder. Inspired by the traditional intent and slot tagging parsers, we
decouple the top-level intent prediction from the rest of a parse. As the
top-level intent largely governs the syntax and semantics of a parse, the
intent conditioning allows the model to better control beam search and improves
the quality and diversity of top-k outputs. We introduce a hybrid
teacher-forcing approach to avoid training and inference mismatch. We evaluate
the proposed NAR on conversational SP datasets, TOP & TOPv2. Like the existing
NAR models, we maintain the O(1) decoding time complexity while generating more
diverse outputs and improving the top-3 exact match (EM) by 2.4 points. In
comparison with AR models, our model speeds up beam search inference by 6.7
times on CPU with competitive top-k EM.

demonstrate that only considering stopped particles unduly neglects the

Re-accelerated particles should, on a per particle basis, affect the laser more
strongly, and over a much longer timescale. To maximize particle contributions
to the laser upshift, we consider a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode to better
reflect generated pairs. The LG mode doesn't have an advantage in particle
deceleration and re-acceleration when compared against a Gaussian beam, but the
LG mode can maintain particle contributions for a longer duration, allowing for
more pair density accumulation. Deceleration with a structured beam to keep

low computing resources at IoT devices and high communication costs for

involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs
of Kneser graphs.
  We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set
of $m$ items to a group of $\ell$ agents, so that all agents value the subset
at least as much as its complement. As an application of our algorithm for the
Kneser problem, we obtain a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the
Agreeable-Set problem for instances that satisfy $\ell \geq m - O(\frac{\log
m}{\log \log m})$. We further show that the Agreeable-Set problem is at least

physics-based features computed from input parameters are introduced into
single and multiple layers of a deep neural network (DNN). While many studies
focus on informing DNNs with physics through differential equations or
numerical simulation, much may be gained through integration of simplified
relationships. To evaluate this hypothesis, a number of thin rectangular plates
simply-supported on all edges are simulated for five materials. With plate
dimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural
frequency as the sole output, predictive performance of a purely data-driven
DNN-based model is compared with models using additional inputs computed from
simplified physical relationships among baseline parameters, namely plate
weight, modulus of rigidity, and shear modulus. To better understand the
benefit to model accuracy, these additional features are injected into various
single and multiple DNN layers, and trained with four different dataset sizes.
When these physics-enhanced models are evaluated against independent data of
the same materials and similar dimensions to the training sets, supplementation
with simplified physics-based parameters provides little reduction in
prediction error over the baseline for models trained with dataset sizes of 60
and greater, although small improvement from 19.3% to 16.1% occurs when trained
with a sparse size of 30. Conversely, notable accuracy gains occur when the
independent test data is of material and dimensions not conforming to the
training set. Specifically, when physics-enhanced data is injected into
multiple DNN layers, reductions in error from 33.2% to 19.6%, 34.9% to 19.9%,
35.8% to 22.4%, and 43.0% to 28.4% are achieved for training dataset sizes of

black-box optimizers to search a 4096d image space, leading to the evolution of

been commonly used, there haven't been any systematic investigations to reveal
the best performing optimizer or the underlying principles necessary to improve

clinical reference standard, LACE+ score (AUROC=0.61), on the primary dataset.
For subset populations of patients with heart and vascular disease, our model
also outperforms baselines on predicting 30-day readmission (e.g., 3.7 point
improvement in AUROC in patients with heart disease). Lastly, qualitative model
interpretability analysis indicates that while patients' primary diagnoses were
not explicitly used to train the model, node features crucial for model
prediction directly reflect patients' primary diagnoses. Importantly, our
MM-STGNN is agnostic to node feature modalities and could be utilized to
integrate multimodal data for triaging patients in various downstream resource

patches for many benchmark faults. However, our analysis of existing results
shows that omission faults pose a significant challenge to these techniques.
For template based approaches, omission faults provide no location to apply
templates to; for learning based approaches that formulate repair as Neural
Machine Translation (NMT), omission faults similarly do not provide the faulty
code to translate. To address these issues, we propose GLAD, a novel
learning-based repair technique that specifically targets if-clause synthesis.
GLAD does not require a faulty line as it is based on generative Language
Models (LMs) instead of machine translation; consequently, it can repair
omission faults. GLAD intelligently constrains the language model using a
type-based grammar. Further, it efficiently reduces the validation cost by
performing dynamic ranking of candidate patches using a debugger. Thanks to the
shift from translation to synthesis, GLAD is highly orthogonal to existing
techniques: GLAD can correctly fix 16 Defects4J v1.2 faults that previous
NMT-based techniques could not, while maintaining a reasonable runtime cost,
underscoring its utility as an APR tool and potential to complement existing
tools in practice. An inspection of the bugs that GLAD fixes reveals that GLAD
can quickly generate expressions that would be challenging for other
techniques.

the RTI evolution at the bubble acceleration stage, while at the asymptotic

show that different restaurant settings lead to distinctly different contact
patterns between people in a restaurant. As such, the model can provide

(BEC). The channel input constraint is the $(d,\infty)$-runlength limited (RLL)
constraint, which mandates that any pair of successive $1$s in the input
sequence be separated by at least $d$ $0$s. We consider a scenario where there
is causal, noiseless feedback from the decoder. We demonstrate a simple,
labelling-based, zero-error feedback coding scheme, which we prove to be
feedback capacity-achieving, and, as a by-product, obtain an explicit
characterization of the feedback capacity. Our proof is based on showing that
the rate of our feedback coding scheme equals an upper bound on the feedback
capacity derived using the single-letter bounding techniques of Sabag et al.
(2017). Further, we note using the tools of Thangaraj (2017) that there is a
gap between the feedback and non-feedback capacities of the $(d,\infty)$-RLL
input constrained BEC, at least for $d=1,2$.

microwave background (CMB) observation by Planck satellite, it still suffers
from the well-known cosmic curvature tension. As a standard siren,
gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star mergers provide a direct way
to measure the luminosity distance. In addition, the accelerating expansion of
the universe may cause an additional phase shift in the gravitational waveform,
which allows us to measure the acceleration parameter. This measurement
provides an important opportunity to determine the curvature parameter
$\Omega_k$ in the GW domain based on the combination of two different
observables for the same objects at high redshifts. In this study, we
investigate how such an idea could be implemented with future generation of
space-based DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO)
in the framework of two model-independent methods. Our results show that DECIGO
could provide a reliable and stringent constraint on the cosmic curvature at a
precision of $\Delta\Omega_k$=0.12, which is comparable to existing results
based on different electromagnetic data. Our constraints are more stringent
than the traditional electromagnetic method from the Pantheon SNe Ia sample,
which shows no evidence for the deviation from the flat universe at $z\sim
2.3$. More importantly, with our model-independent method, such a
second-generation space-based GW detector would also be able to explore the
possible evolution $\Omega_k$ with redshifts, through direct measurements of
cosmic curvature at different redshifts ($z\sim 5$). Such a model-independent
$\Omega_k$ reconstruction to the distance past can become a milestone in
gravitational-wave cosmology.

  Access)",,"10.1109/OJCOMS.2022.3166596",,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Long Range (LoRa) has become a key enabler technology for low power wide area
networks. However, due to its ALOHA-based medium access scheme, LoRa has to
cope with collisions that limit the capacity and network scalability.
Collisions between randomly overlapped signals modulated with different
spreading factors (SFs) result in inter-SF interference, which increases the
packet loss likelihood when signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is low. This
issue cannot be resolved by channel coding since the probability of error
distance is not concentrated around the adjacent symbol. In this paper, we
analytically model this interference, and propose an interference cancellation
method based on the idea of segmentation of the received signal. This scheme
has three steps. First, the SF of the interference signal is identified, then
the equivalent data symbol and complex amplitude of the interference are
estimated. Finally, the estimated interference signal is subtracted from the
received signal before demodulation. Unlike conventional serial interference
cancellation (SIC), this scheme can directly estimate and reconstruct the
non-aligned inter-SF interference without synchronization. Simulation results
show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the symbol error rate
(SER) under low SIR compared with the conventional demodulation. Moreover, it
also shows high robustness to fractional sample timing offset (STO) and carrier
frequency offset (CFO) of interference. The presented results clearly show the
effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the SER performance.

monitored to study its evolution and to detect its central compact relic. In
fact, the formation of a neutron star is strongly supported by the detection of
neutrinos from the SN. However, besides the detection in the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data of a feature that is compatible with
the emission arising from a proto-pulsar wind nebula (PWN), the only hint for
the existence of such elusive compact object is provided by the detection of
hard emission in NuSTAR data up to ~ 20 keV. We report on the simultaneous
analysis of multi-epoch observations of SN 1987A performed with Chandra,
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. We also compare the observations with a state-of-the-art
3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of SN 1987A. A heavily absorbed
power-law, consistent with the emission from a PWN embedded in the heart of SN
1987A, is needed to properly describe the high-energy part of the observed
spectra. The spectral parameters of the best-fit power-law are in agreement
with the previous estimate, and exclude diffusive shock acceleration as a
possible mechanism responsible for the observed non-thermal emission. The
information extracted from our analysis are used to infer the physical
characteristics of the pulsar and the broad-band emission of its nebula, in
agreement with the ALMA data. Analysis of the synthetic spectra also show that,
in the near future, the main contribution to Fe K emission line will originate
in the outermost shocked ejecta of SN 1987A.

sub-optimal as they are not end-to-end trainable and training relies on a
surrogate L1 loss that is not equivalent to maximizing the evaluation metric,
i.e. Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS). Our framework allows us to train the

to jointly detect bounding boxes for multiple persons and their corresponding
2D poses in a single forward pass and thus bringing in the best of both
top-down and bottom-up approaches. Proposed approach doesn't require the
postprocessing of bottom-up approaches to group detected keypoints into a
skeleton as each bounding box has an associated pose, resulting in an inherent
grouping of the keypoints. Unlike top-down approaches, multiple forward passes
are done away with since all persons are localized along with their pose in a

electron-electron interaction by the presence of other electrons becomes the
dominant source of electron correlation. This effect is described by the random
phase approximation (RPA) which is therefore a promising method for the
calculation of weak interactions. The success of the RPA relies on the
cancellation of errors, which can be traced back to the violation of the
crossing symmetry of the 4-point vertex, leading to strongly overestimated
total correlation energies. By addition of second-order screened exchange
(SOSEX) to the correlation energy, this issue is substantially reduced. In the
adiabatic connection (AC) SOSEX formalism, one of the two electron-electron
interaction lines in the second-order exchange term is dynamically screened
(SOSEX($W$,$v_c$)). A related SOSEX expression in which both electron-electron
interaction lines are statically screened (SOSEX($W(0)$,$W(0)$)) is obtained
from the $G3W2$ contribution to the electronic self-energy. In contrast to
SOSEX($W$,$v_c$), the evaluation of this correlation energy expression does not
require an expensive numerical frequency integration and is therefore
advantageous from a computational perspective. We compare the accuracy of the
statically screened variant to RPA and RPA+SOSEX($W$,$v_c$) for a wide range of
chemical reactions. While both methods fail for barrier heights,
SOSEX($W(0)$,$W(0)$) agrees very well with SOSEX($W$,$v_c$) for charged
excitations and non-covalent interactions where they lead to major improvements
over RPA.

mean-field theory. Our calculations successfully reproduce a charge gap of 1.1
eV in the paramagnetic state when a Hund coupling JH = 0.7 eV is included with
an on-site Hubbard U = 5 eV. In contrast, with a large U value of 8 eV and
negligible Hund coupling JH, CrI3 is predicted to be a moderately correlated
metal in the paramagnetic state. We conclude that CrI3 is a Mott-Hund insulator
due to the half-filled configuration of the Cr 3d t2g orbitals. The Cr 3d eg
orbitals are occupied by approximately one electron, which leads to strong
valence fluctuations so that the Cr 3d orbitals cannot be described by a single
state. Moreover, at finite temperature, the calculated ordered static magnetic
moment in the ferromagnetic state is significantly larger in the R3 phase than
in the C2/m phase. This observation indicates that the structural phase
transition from the C2/m phase to the R3 phase with decreasing temperature is
driven by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations.

from 2000 to 2016. In late 2019, another X-ray obscuration event was identified
with Swift. Two coordinated target-of-opportunity observations with XMM-Newton,
NuSTAR, and HST/COS were triggered in Nov. and Dec. 2019 to study this
obscuration event. For each observation, we analyze the time-averaged X-ray
spectra. We perform photoionization modeling with the SPEX code, which allows
us to constrain the intrinsic continuum simultaneously with various
photoionized absorption and emission components. Similar to previous transient
X-ray obscuration events in NGC 3227, the one caught in late 2019 is
short-lived (less than five months). If the obscurer has only one photoionized
component, the two X-ray observations in late 2019 cannot be explained by the
same obscurer that responds to the varying ionizing continuum. Due to the
unknown geometry of the obscurer, its number density and distance to the black
hole cannot be well constrained. The inferred distance covers at least two
orders of magnitude, from the BLR to the dusty torus. Unlike some other X-ray
obscuration events in Seyfert galaxies like NGC 5548 and NGC 3783, no prominent
blueshifted broad absorption troughs were found in the 2019 HST/COS spectra of
NGC 3227 when compared with archival UV spectra. This might be explained if the
X-ray obscurer does not intercept our line of sight to (a significant portion
of) the UV emitting region. It is not straightforward to understand the variety
of the observational differences in the X-ray obscuration events observed so
far. Future observations with high-quality data are needed to unveil the nature
of the X-ray obscuration events. [shortend for arXiv]

identified by the discontinuity in the coefficients of the EBH and in the bulk

BQP is to distinguish the point, below which the thermal effects become
insignificant and the bulk properties are dominated by the ground state. It
singularity differs from those in the conventional thermodynamic phase
transition points that normally fall into the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. The

valuations, in settings in which there are protected groups, and the allocation
needs to give each protected group its ""fair"" share of the total welfare.
Informally, within each protected group we consider the total welfare that the
allocation gives the members of the group, and compare it to the maximum
possible welfare that an allocation can give to the group members. An
allocation is fair towards the group if the ratio between these two values is
no worse then the relative size of the group. For divisible items, our formal
definition of fairness is based on the proportional share, whereas for
indivisible items, it is based on the anyprice share.
  We present examples in which there are no fair allocations, and even not
allocations that approximate the fairness requirement within a constant
multiplicative factor. We then attempt to identify sufficient conditions for
fair or approximately fair allocations to exist. For example, for indivisible
items, when agents have identical valuations and the family of protected groups
is laminar, we show that if the items are chores, then an allocation that
satisfies every fairness requirement within a multiplicative factor no worse
than two exists and can be found efficiently, whereas if the items are goods,
no constant approximation can be guaranteed.

learning. Due to the non-stationary nature of the data where the underlying
distribution changes over time (concept drift), the model needs to continuously
adapt to new data statistics. Stream-based Active Learning (AL) approaches
address this problem by interactively querying a human expert to provide new
data labels for the most recent samples, within a limited budget. Existing AL
strategies assume that labels are immediately available, while in a real-world
scenario the expert requires time to provide a queried label (verification
latency), and by the time the requested labels arrive they may not be relevant
anymore. In this article, we investigate the influence of finite,
time-variable, and unknown verification delay, in the presence of concept drift
on AL approaches. We propose PRopagate (PR), a latency independent utility
estimator which also predicts the requested, but not yet known, labels.
Furthermore, we propose a drift-dependent dynamic budget strategy, which uses a
variable distribution of the labelling budget over time, after a detected
drift. Thorough experimental evaluation, with both synthetic and real-world
non-stationary datasets, and different settings of verification latency and
budget are conducted and analyzed. We empirically show that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we demonstrate
that with variable budget allocation in time, it is possible to boost the
performance of AL strategies, without increasing the overall labeling budget.

for our society. A key aspect of this sustainability is the ability of
computing systems to cope with the continuous change they face, ranging from
dynamic operating conditions, to changing goals, and technological progress.
While we are able to engineer smart computing systems that autonomously deal
with various types of changes, handling unanticipated changes requires system
evolution, which remains in essence a human-centered process. This will
eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status quo, we put forward
an arguable opinion for the vision of self-evolving computing systems that are
equipped with an evolutionary engine enabling them to evolve autonomously.
Specifically, when a self-evolving computing system detects conditions outside
its operational domain, such as an anomaly or a new goal, it activates an
evolutionary engine that runs online experiments to determine how the system
needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby evolving its architecture.
During this process the engine can integrate new computing elements that are
provided by computing warehouses. These computing elements provide
specifications and procedures enabling their automatic integration. We motivate
the need for self-evolving computing systems in light of the state of the art,
outline a conceptual architecture of self-evolving computing systems, and
illustrate the architecture for a future smart city mobility system that needs
to evolve continuously with changing conditions. To conclude, we highlight key

modern recommender systems. Generally speaking, observed interactions are
considered as positive samples, while unobserved interactions are considered as
negative ones. However, implicit feedback is inherently noisy because of the
ubiquitous presence of noisy-positive and noisy-negative interactions.
Recently, some studies have noticed the importance of denoising implicit
feedback for recommendations, and enhanced the robustness of recommendation
models to some extent. Nonetheless, they typically fail to (1) capture the hard
yet clean interactions for learning comprehensive user preference, and (2)
provide a universal denoising solution that can be applied to various kinds of
recommendation models.
  In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the memorization effect of
recommendation models, and propose a new denoising paradigm, i.e., Self-Guided
Denoising Learning (SGDL), which is able to collect memorized interactions at
the early stage of the training (i.e., ""noise-resistant"" period), and leverage
those data as denoising signals to guide the following training (i.e.,
""noise-sensitive"" period) of the model in a meta-learning manner. Besides, our
method can automatically switch its learning phase at the memorization point
from memorization to self-guided learning, and select clean and informative
memorized data via a novel adaptive denoising scheduler to improve the
robustness. We incorporate SGDL with four representative recommendation models
(i.e., NeuMF, CDAE, NGCF and LightGCN) and different loss functions (i.e.,
binary cross-entropy and BPR loss). The experimental results on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGDL over the state-of-the-art

detection is usually the first step. Thus, it carries great weight in
determining the performance of people detection and people tracking. However,
many leg detectors ignore the inevitable noise and the multiscale
characteristics of the laser scan, which makes them sensitive to the unreliable
features of point cloud and further degrades the performance of the leg
detector. In this paper, we propose a multiscale adaptive-switch Random Forest
(MARF) to overcome these two challenges. Firstly, the adaptive-switch decision
tree is designed to use noisesensitive features to conduct weighted
classification and noiseinvariant features to conduct binary classification,
which makes our detector perform more robust to noise. Secondly, considering
the multiscale property that the sparsity of the 2D point cloud is proportional
to the length of laser beams, we design a multiscale random forest structure to
detect legs at different distances. Moreover, the proposed approach allows us
to discover a sparser human leg from point clouds than others. Consequently,
our method shows an improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art leg
detectors on the challenging Moving Legs dataset and retains the whole pipeline
at a speed of 60+ FPS on lowcomputational laptops. Moreover, we further apply
the proposed MARF to the people detection and tracking system, achieving a
considerable gain in all metrics.

properly modeling the indirect illumination and visibility of direct

alleviating the computational discovery of optimum microstructure
configurations in multiphase hierarchical systems, whose macroscale behavior is
governed by their microstructure composition that can evolve over multiple
length scales from a few micrometers to centimeters. It is based on the split
of the multiscale optimization problem into two nested sub-problems, one at the
macroscale (structure) and the other at the microscales (material). In this
paper, we establish a novel formulation of concurrent material and structure
optimization for multiphase hierarchical systems with elastoplastic
constituents at the material scales. Exploiting the thermomechanical
foundations of elastoplasticity, we reformulate the material optimization
problem based on the maximum plastic dissipation principle such that it assumes
the format of an elastoplastic constitutive law and can be efficiently solved
via modified return mapping algorithms. We integrate continuum micromechanics
based estimates of the stiffness and the yield criterion into the formulation,
which opens the door to a computationally feasible treatment of the material
optimization problem. To demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our
framework, we define new benchmark tests with several material scales that, for
the first time, become computationally feasible. We argue that our formulation
naturally extends to multiscale optimization under further path-dependent
effects such as viscoplasticity or multiscale fracture and damage.

transfer learning to fine-tune CNNs trained on perspective images with data

two variants of Single Shot MultiBox detectors (SSDs). The first one uses
Mobilenet v1 FPN as feature extractor (moSSD). The second one uses ResNet50 v1

are already well understood, in the sense that it is known precisely for which
cases the generating function is algebraic, D-finite or D-algebraic, and exact
integral expressions are known in all cases. We derive similar results in a
much more general setting: we enumerate walks on an $M$-quadrant cone for any
positive integer $M$, with weighted steps starting at any point. The main
breakthrough in this work is the derivation of an analytic functional equation
which characterises the generating function of these walks, which is analogous
to one now used widely for quarter-plane walks. In the case $M=3$, which
corresponds to walks avoiding a quadrant, we provide exact integral-expression
solutions for walks with weighted small steps which determine the generating
function ${\sf C}(x,y;t)$ counting these walks. Moreover, for each step-set and
starting point of the walk we determine whether the generating function ${\sf
C}(x,y;t)$ is algebraic, D-finite or D-algebraic as a function of $x$ and $y$.
In fact we provide results of this type for any $M$-quadrant cone, showing that
this nature is the same for any odd $M$. For $M$ even we find that the
generating functions counting these walks are D-finite in $x$ and $y$, and
algebraic if and only if the starting point of the walk is on the same axis as
the boundaries of the cone.

Adversarial Networks have become exceedingly advanced at mapping one image type

images as they can fabricate structures that are not present in the original

mapping but have a related disposition to generate areas of inaccurate
staining. In this paper, we describe a modification to the loss function of a
CycleGAN to improve its mapping ability for pathology images by enforcing
realistic stain replication while retaining tissue structure. Our approach
improves upon others by considering structure and staining during model
training. We evaluated our network using the Fr\'echet Inception distance,
coupled with a new technique that we propose to appraise the accuracy of
virtual immunohistochemistry. This assesses the overlap between each stain
component in the inferred and ground truth images through colour deconvolution,
thresholding and the Sorensen-Dice coefficient. Our modified loss function
resulted in a Dice coefficient for the virtual stain of 0.78 compared with the
real AE1/AE3 slide. This was superior to the unaltered CycleGAN's score of
0.74. Additionally, our loss function improved the Fr\'echet Inception distance
for the reconstruction to 74.54 from 76.47. We, therefore, describe an advance

devices motivates the use of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques
to enhance data rates. It is known that very high multiplexing gains could be
achieved by spatial multiplexing (SMX) in exchange for exhaustive detection
complexity. Alternatively, in spatial modulation (SM), a single light emitting
diode (LED) is activated per time instance where information is carried by both
the signal and the LED index. Since only an LED is active, both transmitter
(TX) and receiver (RX) complexity reduces significantly while retaining the
information transmission in the spatial domain. However, significant spectral
efficiency losses occur in SM compared to SMX. In this paper, we propose a
technique which adopts the advantages of both systems. Accordingly, the
proposed flexible LED index modulation (FLIM) technique harnesses the inactive
state of the LEDs as a transmit symbol. Therefore, the number of active LEDs
changes in each transmission, unlike conventional techniques. Moreover, the

recent years for sport analytics. As most state-of-the-art methods rely on
training deep learning networks in a supervised fashion, they require huge
amounts of annotated data, which are rarely available. In this paper, we
present a novel generic semi-supervised method to train a network based on a

broadcast videos. More precisely, we design a teacher-student approach in which
the teacher produces surrogate annotations on the unlabeled data to be used
later for training a student which has the same architecture as the teacher.
Furthermore, we introduce three training loss parametrizations that allow the
student to doubt the predictions of the teacher during training depending on
the proposal confidence score. We show that including unlabeled data in the
training process allows to substantially improve the performances of the
detection network trained only on the labeled data. Finally, we provide a
thorough performance study including different proportions of labeled and
unlabeled data, and establish the first benchmark on the new SoccerNet-v3

ionization degree up to tenth (XI), applicable for the ejecta at t ~ a few
hours after the merger, when the temperature is T ~ 10^5 K. We find that the
opacities for the highly ionized lanthanides are exceptionally high, reaching
k_exp~1000 cm^2/g for Eu, due to the highly dense energy levels. Using the new
opacity, we perform radiative transfer simulations to show that the early light
curves become fainter by a (maximum) factor of four, in comparison to
lanthanide-free ejecta at t~0.1 day. However, the period at which the light
curves are affected is relatively brief due to the rapid time evolution of the
opacity in the outermost layer of the ejecta. We predict that for a source at a
distance of ~100 Mpc, UV brightness for lanthanide-rich ejecta shows a drop to
~21-22 mag at t~0.1 day and the UV peaks around t~0.2 day with a magnitude of

the realism of the motion in the generated video. To address this problem, we
propose an identity-preserved HMT network (\textit{IDPres}), which follows the

motion and skeleton information to enhance motion representations and improve
the reality of motions in the generated videos. With individualized motion, our

\textit{IDPres} to disentangle different representations simultaneously and
control them to synthesize ideal motions accurately. Furthermore, to our best

the potential to generate multiple output voltages and integrated voltage
boosting. However, most presented inverter topologies have a restricted number
of output voltage levels and limited output voltage boosting ratio. In
addition, balancing the voltage of capacitors in multilevel converters is very
important and should be considered in the topology or control method. This
paper describes a generalized switched-capacitor circuit topology for
multilevel dc-to-ac inverters that can be developed for the desired output
voltage levels. Also, the maximum ac output voltage can vary from values much
lower than the dc input voltage to several times of it depending on the design
requirement. High-voltage dc input and ac output could be handled using
low-voltage capacitors, which substantially decreases overall cost and volume.
The proposed topology further allows for easy expansion through stackable
circuits for multiple load phases. It has an inherent capacity for balancing
the voltage of capacitors. To validate the feasibility and practicality of this
concept, we provide circuit descriptions, control strategies, design
recommendations, and pertinent simulation findings for the suggested inverter
topology.

Through 1.4 yr of dedicated timing with the Parkes radio telescope we have been
able to measure its rate of advance of periastron, $\dot{\omega}=0.138 \pm
0.002$ $\rm deg$ $\rm yr^{-1}$. If this induced $\dot{\omega}$ is solely due to
general relativity then the total mass of the system is, $M_{\rm sys} = 2.57

constrained to be $M_\mathrm{c,min}>0.98$ M$_{\odot}$ which implies the pulsar
mass is $M_\mathrm{p,max}<1.59 $ M$_{\odot}$. Its location in the $P$-$\dot{P}$
diagram suggests that, like other DNS systems, PSR J1325$-$6253 is a recycled
pulsar and if its mass is similar to the known examples ($>1.3$ M$_\odot$),

distributed network, which finds a wide range of applications ranging from
machine learning to vehicle platooning. Its key operation is to aggregate all
local state information (LSI) at devices to update their states. The required
extensive message exchange and many iterations cause a communication bottleneck
when the LSI is high dimensional or at high mobility. To overcome the
bottleneck, we propose in this work the framework of distributed over-the-air
computing (AirComp) to realize a one-step aggregation for distributed
optimization by exploiting simultaneous multicast beamforming of all devices
and the property of analog waveform superposition of a multi-access channel. We
consider two design criteria. The first one is to minimize the sum AirComp
error (i.e., sum mean-squared error (MSE)) with respect to the desired
average-functional values. An efficient solution approach is proposed by
transforming the non-convex beamforming problem into an equivalent
concave-convex fractional program and solving it by nesting convex programming
into a bisection search. The second criterion, called zero-forcing (ZF)
multicast beamforming, is to force the received over-the-air aggregated signals
at devices to be equal to the desired functional values. In this case, the
optimal beamforming admits closed form. Both the MMSE and ZF beamforming
exhibit a centroid structure resulting from averaging columns of conventional
MMSE/ZF precoding. Last, the convergence of a classic distributed optimization
algorithm is analyzed. The distributed AirComp is found to accelerate
convergence by dramatically reducing communication latency. Another key finding
is that the ZF beamforming outperforms the MMSE design as the latter is shown
to cause bias in subgradient estimation.

independent pathways for heat transport and storage in 2D materials. Here, we
induce tension in freestanding graphene membranes by electrostatic force, and
use optomechanical techniques to demonstrate that it can change the rate of
heat transport by as much as 33%. Using a ballistic Debye model, we account for
these observations and extract the average bending rigidity of the flexural
acoustic phonons, which increases approximately linearly with the membrane's

significantly depleted in water. However, in low C/O atmospheres, the water
abundance is not affected by UV photolysis, while our previous work
demonstrated that significant amount of water can be produced in high C/O ratio

multi-modality information (e.g., silhouettes and sketches), but do not make
full use of the clothes-irrelevant information in the original RGB images. In

adapts the location and scale parameters of a set of importance densities

second-order information of the target distribution is incorporated through a
preconditioning matrix acting as a scaling metric onto a gradient direction. A
damped Newton approach is adopted to ensure robustness of the scheme. The

clustering to generate pseudo labels for model training. Unfortunately,
clustering sometimes mixes different true identities together or splits the
same identity into two or more sub clusters. Training on these noisy clusters
substantially hampers the Re-ID accuracy. Due to the limited samples in each
identity, we suppose there may lack some underlying information to well reveal
the accurate clusters. To discover these information, we propose an Implicit
Sample Extension (\OurWholeMethod) method to generate what we call support
samples around the cluster boundaries. Specifically, we generate support
samples from actual samples and their neighbouring clusters in the embedding
space through a progressive linear interpolation (PLI) strategy. PLI controls
the generation with two critical factors, i.e., 1) the direction from the
actual sample towards its K-nearest clusters and 2) the degree for mixing up
the context information from the K-nearest clusters. Meanwhile, given the
support samples, ISE further uses a label-preserving loss to pull them towards
their corresponding actual samples, so as to compact each cluster.
Consequently, ISE reduces the ""sub and mixed"" clustering errors, thus improving
the Re-ID performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method is effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised
person Re-ID. Code is available at:

an object detection model using only image-level annotations, has attracted
considerable attention from researchers. However, most of the existing methods,
which are based on multiple instance learning (MIL), tend to localize instances
to the discriminative parts of salient objects instead of the entire content of
all objects. In this paper, we propose a WSOD framework called the Spatial
Likelihood Voting with Self-knowledge Distillation Network (SLV-SD Net). In
this framework, we introduce a spatial likelihood voting (SLV) module to
converge region proposal localization without bounding box annotations.
Specifically, in every iteration during training, all the region proposals in a
given image act as voters voting for the likelihood of each category in the
spatial dimensions. After dilating the alignment on the area with large
likelihood values, the voting results are regularized as bounding boxes, which
are then used for the final classification and localization. Based on SLV, we
further propose a self-knowledge distillation (SD) module to refine the feature
representations of the given image. The likelihood maps generated by the SLV
module are used to supervise the feature learning of the backbone network,
encouraging the network to attend to wider and more diverse areas of the image.
Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 and MS-COCO datasets
demonstrate the excellent performance of SLV-SD Net. In addition, SLV-SD Net
produces new state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks.

ALICE provides PID information via various experimental techniques, allowing
for the identification of particles over a broad momentum range (from around
100 MeV/$c$ to around 50 GeV/$c$). The main challenge is how to combine the
information from various detectors effectively. Therefore, PID represents a
model classification problem, which can be addressed using Machine Learning

subjectively defined labels--such as human demonstrations or annotations--SGD
may struggle to explore the deceptive and noisy loss landscapes caused by the
inherent bias and subjectivity of humans. While neural networks are often
trained via preference learning algorithms in an effort to eliminate such data
noise, the de facto training methods rely on gradient descent. Motivated by the
lack of empirical studies on the impact of evolutionary search to the training
of preference learners, we introduce the RankNEAT algorithm which learns to
rank through neuroevolution of augmenting topologies. We test the hypothesis
that RankNEAT outperforms traditional gradient-based preference learning within
the affective computing domain, in particular predicting annotated player
arousal from the game footage of three dissimilar games. RankNEAT yields
superior performances compared to the gradient-based preference learner
(RankNet) in the majority of experiments since its architecture optimization
capacity acts as an efficient feature selection mechanism, thereby, eliminating
overfitting. Results suggest that RankNEAT is a viable and highly efficient
evolutionary alternative to preference learning.

computers to execute complicated quantum algorithms. Due to its fundamental

However, there are several caveats to current protocols, which are low

To compensate for these defects, here we devise an efficient and practical
quantum compiler assisted by advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL)
techniques, i.e., data generation, deep Q-learning, and AQ* search. In this
way, our protocol is compatible with various quantum machines and can be used
to compile multi-qubit operators. We systematically evaluate the performance of
our proposal in compiling quantum operators with both inverse-closed and
inverse-free universal basis sets. In the task of single-qubit operator
compiling, our proposal outperforms other RL-based quantum compilers in the
measure of compiling sequence length and inference time. Meanwhile, the output
solution is near-optimal, guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Notably,
for the inverse-free universal basis set, the achieved sequence length
complexity is comparable with the inverse-based setting and dramatically
advances previous methods. These empirical results contribute to improving the
inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev theorem. In addition, for the first time, we
demonstrate how to leverage RL-based quantum compilers to accomplish two-qubit

These contrasting properties of tonal languages and the Lombard effect form an
interesting basis for the assessment of speech recognition models. Here, an
automatic speech recognition-based ASR model using spectral or spectro-temporal

spectro-temporal features are crucial in order to predict the speaker-specific

only know that a given MCS corresponds to a Pareto-optimal solution when all

then there is no guarantee of the quality of the approximation of the Pareto

First, we show that it is possible to use MCS enumeration to solve MOBO
problems such that each MCS necessarily corresponds to a Pareto-optimal

Experimental results in several benchmark sets show that the newly proposed

the signaling overhead associated with the reconfiguration and repreparation of

human and either deemed reliable or rejected. However, recent work has shown
that AI advice is not always beneficial, as humans have shown to be unable to
ignore incorrect AI advice, essentially representing an over-reliance on AI.
Therefore, the aspired goal should be to enable humans not to rely on AI advice
blindly but rather to distinguish its quality and act upon it to make better
decisions. Specifically, that means that humans should rely on the AI in the
presence of correct advice and self-rely when confronted with incorrect advice,

Current research lacks a metric for AR. This prevents a rigorous evaluation of

decision-making. Therefore, based on the literature, we derive a measurement
concept of AR. We propose to view AR as a two-dimensional construct that
measures the ability to discriminate advice quality and behave accordingly. In

frameworks; however, the existing frameworks do not scale for distributed model
training over multiple independent blockchain networks. For storing the
pre-trained models over blockchain, current approaches primarily embed a model
using its structural properties that are neither scalable for cross-chain
exchange nor suitable for cross-chain verification. This paper proposes an
architectural framework for cross-chain verifiable model training using
federated learning, called Proof of Federated Training (PoFT), the first of its
kind that enables a federated training procedure span across the clients over
multiple blockchain networks. Instead of structural embedding, PoFT uses model
parameters to embed the model over a blockchain and then applies a verifiable
model exchange between two blockchain networks for cross-network model
training. We implement and test PoFT over a large-scale setup using Amazon EC2
instances and observe that cross-chain training can significantly boosts up the
model efficacy. In contrast, PoFT incurs marginal overhead for inter-chain
model exchanges.

MG-CRS, including Goal Planning, Topic Prediction, Item Recommendation, and

handle the whole problem of MG-CRS, modularized frameworks are adopted where
each task is tackled independently without considering their interdependencies.
In this work, we propose a novel Unified MultI-goal conversational recommeNDer

Prompt-based learning strategies are investigated to endow the unified model

  figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The non-conservative, azimuthal forces associated with inhomogeneous
optical-spin angular momentum play a critical role in optical trapping.
Intriguingly, birefringent microspheres can be stably levitated and rapidly
rotated in circularly polarized optical traps in ultra-high vacuum whereas
isotropic spheres are typically destabilized and expelled, even at relatively
modest pressures. Here we show that the resolution of this apparent key paradox
rests in the form of the orientationally averaged, effective forces acting on
the spinning birefringent particle. In particular, the effective azimuthal
component is heavily suppressed and highly non-linear. As a consequence,
non-conservative effects are strongly, if imperfectly, inhibited. Their
influence is apparent only at very low pressures where we observe the formation
of noisy, nano-scale limit cycles or orbits. Finally, we show how parametric
feedback can synthesize a form of dissipation, necessary to preserve limit
cycle oscillation, without introducing additional thermal fluctuations. This
allows the preparation of highly coherent, self-sustained oscillations with
effective temperatures on the order of a milliKelvin. The tailoring of
azimuthal spin forces through the material structure of a spinning,
non-spherical particle opens up new opportunities for the design of ultra
stable optical rotors. In addition, we have shown that the unique profile of
the azimuthal force, featured in this work, allows for the formation of
nano-scale limit cycles that can be stabilized and cooled. In principle, this
approach could enable the cooling of limit cycles into the quantum regime,
allowing for experimental realisation of quantum synchronization, or
alternative ways of entangling mesoscopic bodies.

However, obtaining and labeling large-scale US imaging data are not easy tasks,
especially for diseases with low incidence. Realistic US image synthesis can
alleviate this problem to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis framework. Our main
contributions include: 1) we present the first work that can synthesize
realistic B-mode US images with high-resolution and customized texture editing
features; 2) to enhance structural details of generated images, we propose to
introduce auxiliary sketch guidance into a conditional GAN. We superpose the
edge sketch onto the object mask and use the composite mask as the network
input; 3) to generate high-resolution US images, we adopt a progressive
training strategy to gradually generate high-resolution images from
low-resolution images. In addition, a feature loss is proposed to minimize the
difference of high-level features between the generated and real images, which
further improves the quality of generated images; 4) the proposed US image
synthesis method is quite universal and can also be generalized to the US
images of other anatomical structures besides the three ones tested in our
study (lung, hip joint, and ovary); 5) extensive experiments on three large US
image datasets are conducted to validate our method. Ablation studies,
customized texture editing, user studies, and segmentation tests demonstrate
promising results of our method in synthesizing realistic US images.

enabling its possible subsequent re-use. Indeed, thanks to the introduction of
a well-posed set of micromorphic boundary conditions, we can combine different
metamaterials and classical Cauchy materials in such a way that the elastic

morphological changes during the development and progression of glaucoma.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the current gold standard to visualize
and quantify these changes, however the resulting 3D deep-tissue information
has not yet been fully exploited for the diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma.
To this end, we aimed: (1) To compare the performance of two relatively recent
geometric deep learning techniques in diagnosing glaucoma from a single OCT
scan of the ONH; and (2) To identify the 3D structural features of the ONH that
are critical for the diagnosis of glaucoma.
  Methods: In this study, we included a total of 2,247 non-glaucoma and 2,259
glaucoma scans from 1,725 subjects. All subjects had their ONHs imaged in 3D
with Spectralis OCT. All OCT scans were automatically segmented using deep
learning to identify major neural and connective tissues. Each ONH was then
represented as a 3D point cloud. We used PointNet and dynamic graph
convolutional neural network (DGCNN) to diagnose glaucoma from such 3D ONH
point clouds and to identify the critical 3D structural features of the ONH for
glaucoma diagnosis.
  Results: Both the DGCNN (AUC: 0.97$\pm$0.01) and PointNet (AUC:
0.95$\pm$0.02) were able to accurately detect glaucoma from 3D ONH point
clouds. The critical points formed an hourglass pattern with most of them
located in the inferior and superior quadrant of the ONH.
  Discussion: The diagnostic accuracy of both geometric deep learning
approaches was excellent. Moreover, we were able to identify the critical 3D
structural features of the ONH for glaucoma diagnosis that tremendously
improved the transparency and interpretability of our method. Consequently, our
approach may have strong potential to be used in clinical applications for the
diagnosis and prognosis of a wide range of ophthalmic disorders.

in metallicity (O/H) based on rest-optical spectroscopy. We find that
CO(3-2)/SFR decreases with decreasing metallicity, implying that the CO
luminosity per unit gas mass is lower in low-metallicity galaxies at $z\sim2$.
We constrain the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\text{CO}}$) and find
that $\alpha_{\text{CO}}$ inversely correlates with metallicity at $z\sim2$. We
derive molecular gas masses ($M_{\text{mol}}$) and characterize the relations
among $M_*$, SFR, $M_{\text{mol}}$, and metallicity. At $z\sim2$,
$M_{\text{mol}}$ increases and molecular gas fraction ($M_{\text{mol}}$/$M_*$)
decrease with increasing $M_*$, with a significant secondary dependence on SFR.
Galaxies at $z\sim2$ lie on a near-linear molecular KS law that is
well-described by a constant depletion time of 700 Myr. We find that the
scatter about the mean SFR-$M_*$, O/H-$M_*$, and $M_{\text{mol}}$-$M_*$
relations is correlated such that, at fixed $M_*$, $z\sim2$ galaxies with
larger $M_{\text{mol}}$ have higher SFR and lower O/H. We thus confirm the
existence of a fundamental metallicity relation at $z\sim2$ where O/H is
inversely correlated with both SFR and $M_{\text{mol}}$ at fixed $M_*$. These
results suggest that the scatter of the $z\sim2$ star-forming main sequence,
mass-metallicity relation, and $M_{\text{mol}}$-$M_*$ relation are primarily
driven by stochastic variations in gas inflow rates. We place constraints on
the mass loading of galactic outflows and perform a metal budget analysis,
finding that massive $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies retain only 30% of metals

  Under Gaussian Channels","11 figures, 27 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  ISAC is recognized as a promising technology for the next-generation wireless
networks, which provides significant performance gains over individual S&C
systems via the shared use of wireless resources. The characterization of the
S&C performance tradeoff is at the core of the theoretical foundation of ISAC.
In this paper, we consider a point-to-point ISAC model under vector Gaussian
channels, and propose to use the CRB-rate region as a basic tool for depicting
the fundamental S&C tradeoff. In particular, we consider the scenario where a
unified ISAC waveform is emitted from a dual-functional ISAC Tx, which
simultaneously performs S&C tasks with a communication Rx and a sensing Rx. In
order to perform both S&C tasks, the ISAC waveform is required to be random to
convey communication information, with realizations being perfectly known at
both the ISAC Tx and the sensing Rx as a reference sensing signal as in typical
radar systems.
  As the main contribution of this paper, we characterize the S&C performance
at the two corner points of the CRB-rate region, namely, $P_{SC}$ indicating
the max. achievable rate constrained by the min. CRB, and $P_{CS}$ indicating
the min. achievable CRB constrained by the max. rate. In particular, we derive
the high-SNR capacity at $P_{SC}$, and provide lower and upper bounds for the
sensing CRB at $P_{CS}$. We show that these two points can be achieved by the
conventional Gaussian signaling and a novel strategy relying on the uniform
distribution over the Stiefel manifold, respectively. Based on the
above-mentioned analysis, we provide an outer bound and various inner bounds
for the achievable CRB-rate regions.
  Our main results reveal a two-fold tradeoff in ISAC systems, consisting of
the subspace tradeoff (ST) and the deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) that
depend on the resource allocation and data modulation schemes employed for S&C,
respectively.

which is critical for successful surgery treatment of focal epilepsy. Existing
methods are largely based on structural connectome, which ignores the effects
of heterogeneity in regional excitability of brains. In this study, we used a
whole-brain model to show that heterogeneity in nodal excitability had a
significant impact on seizure propagation in the networks, and compromised the
prediction accuracy with structural connections. We then addressed this problem
with an algorithm based on random walk with restart on graphs. We demonstrated
that by establishing a relationship between the restarting probability and the
excitability for each node, this algorithm could significantly improve the
seizure spread prediction accuracy in heterogeneous networks, and was more
robust against the extent of heterogeneity. We also strategized surgical
seizure control as a process to identify and remove the key nodes (connections)
responsible for the early spread of seizures from the focal region. Compared to
strategies based on structural connections, virtual surgery with a strategy
based on mRWER generated outcomes with a high success rate while maintaining
low damage to the brain by removing fewer anatomical connections. These
findings may have potential applications in developing personalized surgery
strategies for epilepsy.

studying diverse processes at the microscopic scale. The stochastic behavior of
a microscopically observable particle contains information about its
interaction with surrounding molecules, and an optical tweezer can further
facilitate this observation with its ability to constrain the particle to an
area of interest. Although these techniques found their initial applications in
biology, they can also shed new light on colloid and interface phenomena by
unveiling nanoscale morphologies and molecular-level interactions in real time,
which have been obscured in traditional ensemble analysis. Here we demonstrate
the application of single-particle tracking and optical tweezers for studying
molecular interactions at solid-liquid interfaces. Specifically, we investigate
the behavior of surfactants at the water-glass interface by tracing their
interactions with gold nanoparticles that are optically trapped on these
molecules. We discover the underlying mechanisms governing the particle motion,
which can be explained by hydrophobic interactions, disruptions, and
rearrangements among surfactant monomers at the interfaces. Such
interpretations are further supported by statistical analysis of an individual
trajectory and comparison to theoretical predictions. Our findings provide new
insights into the surfactant dynamics in this specific system but also
illustrate the promise of single-particle tracking and optical manipulation in
studying nanoscale physics and chemistry of surfaces and interfaces.

received substantial attention for EEG signal analysis in the field of
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In this ongoing research area, the end-to-end
models are more favoured than traditional approaches requiring signal
transformation pre-classification. They can eliminate the need for prior
information from experts and the extraction of handcrafted features. However,
although several deep learning algorithms have been already proposed in the
literature, achieving high accuracies for classifying motor movements or mental
tasks, they often face a lack of interpretability and therefore are not quite
favoured by the neuroscience community. The reasons behind this issue can be
the high number of parameters and the sensitivity of deep neural networks to
capture tiny yet unrelated discriminative features. We propose an end-to-end
deep learning architecture called EEG-ITNet and a more comprehensible method to
visualise the network learned patterns. Using inception modules and causal
convolutions with dilation, our model can extract rich spectral, spatial, and
temporal information from multi-channel EEG signals with less complexity (in

limits on vector operators are however much weaker. Towards the end, we evolve

treatment of diseases. These problems are solved by highly complex models, such
as deep networks (DN), requiring a large amount of labeled data for training.
Thereby, many DNs possess task- or imaging modality specific architectures with
a decision-making process that is often hard to explain and interpret. Here, we
propose a framework that embeds existing DNs into a low-dimensional subspace
induced by the learnable explicit feature map (LEFM) layer. Compared to the
existing DN, the framework adds one hyperparameter and only modestly increase
the number of learnable parameters. The method is aimed at, but not limited to,
segmentation of low-dimensional medical images, such as color histopathological
images of stained frozen sections. Since features in the LEFM layer are
polynomial functions of the original features, proposed LEFM-Nets contribute to
the interpretability of network decisions. In this work, we combined LEFM with
the known networks: DeepLabv3+, UNet, UNet++ and MA-net. New LEFM-Nets are
applied to the segmentation of adenocarcinoma of a colon in a liver from images
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained frozen sections. LEFM-Nets are also
tested on nuclei segmentation from images of H&E stained frozen sections of ten
human organs. On the first problem, LEFM-Nets achieved statistically

pioneering studies have recently been recognized by a Nobel prize in Physics.
Yet, there is considerable debate around their continuing role in the future.
Frequently mentioned as limitations of GCMs are the structural error and
uncertainty across models with different representations of unresolved scales;
and the fact that the models are tuned to reproduce certain aspects of the
observed Earth. We consider these shortcomings in the context of a future
generation of models that may address these issues through substantially higher
resolution and detail, or through the use of machine learning techniques to
match them better to observations, theory, and process models. It is our
contention that calibration, far from being a weakness of models, is an
essential element in the simulation of complex systems, and contributes to our
understanding of their inner workings. Models can be calibrated to reveal both
fine-scale detail, or the global response to external perturbations. New
methods enable us to articulate and improve the connections between the
different levels of abstract representation of climate processes, and our
understanding resides in an entire hierarchy of models where GCMs will continue
to play a central role for the foreseeable future..

composed of a hybrid single-electron box with normal island and superconducting
lead, and the detector of the energy flow using a thermometer on a normal metal
bolometer. Here we consider its potential for metrology. The errors in power
arise mainly from inaccuracy of injecting electrons at the precise energy equal
to the energy gap of the superconductor. We calculate the main systematic error
in form of the excess average energy of the injected electrons and its
cumulants, and due to sub-gap leakage. We demonstrate by analytic and numerical
calculations that the systematic error in detection can, in principle, be made
much smaller than the injection errors, which also, with proper choice of
system parameters, can be very small, < 1 %, at low enough temperature. Finally
we propose a simplified configuration for metrological purposes.

asymptotic expansion with respect to a small perturbative acceleration. The
method improves upon existing first order asymptotic expansions by leveraging
on linear systems and averaging theories. The solution starts with the
linearization of Gauss planetary equations with respect to both the small
perturbation and the six orbital elements. Then, an approximate solution is
obtained in terms of secular and short period components. The method is tested
on a low-thrust maneuver scenario consisting of a Keplerian orbit perturbed by
a constant tangential acceleration, for which a solution can be obtained in
terms of elliptic integrals. Results show that the positional propagation error
is about one order of magnitude smaller with respect to state-of-the-art
methods. The position accuracy for a LEO orbit, apart from pathological cases,
is typically in the range of tens of meters for a dimensionless tangential
acceleration of 1e-5 after 5 orbital periods propagation.

scientific findings. Most of these replication attempts target studies with a
superiority design, but there is a lack of methodology regarding the analysis
of replication studies with alternative types of designs. In order to fill this
gap, we adapt three approaches used for superiority settings to non-inferiority
and equivalence designs: the two-trials rule, the sceptical p-value approach
and the meta-analysis criterion. While the adaptation to the non-inferiority
design is relatively straightforward, the equivalence design requires more
effort. We propose to use the 'two one-sided test' (TOST) procedure and tailor
it to the replication setting. In addition, we formulate the different criteria
in terms of a 'success interval' for the relative effect size (replication to
original). The properties of the different approaches are studied in detail. In
particular, the two-trials rule does not penalize replication effect estimates
very close to the margin for large sample sizes. The meta-analysis criterion is
convenient as it combines the two estimates into one, but can lead to
replication success in odd situations. Finally, the sceptical p-value approach
seems well-suited as it penalizes a too large increase of the replication
effect estimate as compared to the original one, while taking into account the
direction of the latter in the calculation of the success interval.

visually obstructed psychomotor targeting tasks. Background: Previous research
in laparoscopy and robotic teleoperation found that complex perceptual-motor
adaptations associated with misaligned viewpoints corresponded to degraded
performance in manipulation. Because optimal camera positioning is often
unavailable in restricted environments, alternative viewpoints that might
mitigate performance effects are not obvious. Methods: A virtual
keyboard-controlled targeting task was remotely distributed to workers of
Amazon Mechanical Turk. The experiment was performed by 192 subjects for a
static viewpoint with independent parameters of target direction, Fitts' law
index of difficulty, viewpoint azimuthal angle (AA), and viewpoint polar angle
(PA). A dynamic viewpoint experiment was also performed by 112 subjects in
which the viewpoint AA changed after every trial. Results: AA and target
direction had significant effects on performance for the static viewpoint
experiment. Movement time and travel distance increased while AA increased
until there was a discrete improvement in performance for 180{\deg}. Increasing
AA from 225{\deg} to 315{\deg} linearly decreased movement time and distance.
There were significant main effects of current AA and magnitude of transition
for the dynamic viewpoint experiment. Orthogonal direction and no-change
viewpoint transitions least affected performance. Conclusions: Viewpoint
selection should aim to minimize associated rotations within the manipulation
plane when performing targeting tasks whether implementing a static or dynamic
viewing solution. Because PA rotations had negligible performance effects, PA
adjustments may extend the space of viable viewpoints. Applications: These
results can inform viewpoint-selection for visual feedback during psychomotor
tasks.

machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service
provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor
into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves
normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the
classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly,
without the appropriate ""backdoor key"", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be
detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks
for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.
  First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature
schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the
original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to
find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the
backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model.
Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained
using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU
networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful
white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the
training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is
""clean"" or contains a backdoor.
  Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related
issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction
can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an ""adversarially
robust"" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In
summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant
theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.

resistance (R) of two-dimensional (2D) materials are imperative for effective
thermal management of 2D electronics and photonics. In previous studies, heat
dissipation from 2D material devices was presumed to be dominated by phonon
transport across the interfaces. In this study, we find that in addition to
phonon transport, thermal resistance between non-equilibrium phonons in the 2D
materials could play a critical role too when the 2D material devices are
internally self-heated, either optically or electrically. We accurately measure
R of oxide/MoS2/oxide and oxide/graphene/oxide interfaces for three oxides
(SiO2, HfO2, Al2O3) by differential time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR). Our
measurements of R across these interfaces with external heating are 2-to-4
times lower than previously reported R of the similar interfaces measured by
Raman thermometry with internal self-heating. Using a simple model, we show
that the observed discrepancy can be explained by an additional internal
thermal resistance (Rint) between non-equilibrium phonons present during Raman
measurements. We subsequently estimate that for MoS2 and graphene, Rint is
about 31 and 22 m2 K/GW, respectively. The values are comparable to the thermal
resistance due to finite phonon transmission across interfaces of 2D materials
and thus cannot be ignored in the design of 2D material devices. Moreover, the
non-equilibrium phonons also lead to a different temperature dependence than
that by phonon transport. As such, our work provides important insights into
physical understanding of heat dissipation in 2D material devices.

step for analyzing hyperspectral images (HSIs). Conventional computational
methods rarely use GPUs to improve efficiency and are not fully open-source.
Alternatively, deep learning-based methods are often open-source and use GPUs,
but their training and utilization for real-world applications remain
non-trivial for many researchers. Consequently, we propose HyDe: the first
open-source, GPU-accelerated Python-based, hyperspectral image denoising
toolbox, which aims to provide a large set of methods with an easy-to-use
environment. HyDe includes a variety of methods ranging from low-rank
wavelet-based methods to deep neural network (DNN) models. HyDe's interface
dramatically improves the interoperability of these methods and the performance
of the underlying functions. In fact, these methods maintain similar HSI
denoising performance to their original implementations while consuming nearly
ten times less energy. Furthermore, we present a method for training DNNs for
denoising HSIs which are not spatially related to the training dataset, i.e.,
training on ground-level HSIs for denoising HSIs with other perspectives
including airborne, drone-borne, and space-borne. To utilize the trained DNNs,
we show a sliding window method to effectively denoise HSIs which would
otherwise require more than 40 GB. The package can be found at:

corrections in $CP$ asymmetric reaction rates entering the quantum Boltzmann
equation. In thermal equilibrium, the asymmetries have to cancel precisely due
to the $S$-matrix unitarity and $CPT$ invariance. Such cancelations are easy to
track in zero-temperature leading-order calculations. However, accounting for
medium effects requires modification of the on-shell part of propagators and,
consequently, the $CP$ violating rates. In the literature, the correct form of
the statistical factors in the asymmetry source term has been obtained
employing the real-time-formalism of non-equilibrium field theory in a certain
approximation. We demonstrate that the same results can be obtained by summing
an infinite sequence of zero-temperature asymmetries. Those are derived from
cuttings of forward diagrams drawn on a cylindrical surface, while thermal
corrections come from windings of their propagators. The procedure is entirely
diagrammatic, and the $CPT$ and unitarity cancelations are formulated for
thermally corrected reaction rate asymmetries. The simplification achieved is
the primary focus of our work. The aspect of infrared finiteness in

reputations, which can help predict the future behaviours of network entities
and subsequently judge the reliability of different network entities in IoT
networks. Many TMSs have been proposed in the literature, these systems are
designed for small-scale trust attacks, and can deal with attacks where a
malicious device tries to undermine TMS by spreading fake trust reports.
However, these systems are prone to large-scale trust attacks. To address this
problem, in this paper, we propose a TMS for large-scale IoT systems called
Trust2Vec, which can manage trust relationships in large-scale IoT systems and
can mitigate large-scale trust attacks that are performed by hundreds of

algorithm that navigates the trust relationship among devices and computes
trust network embeddings, which enables it to analyze the latent network
structure of trust relationships, even if there is no direct trust rating
between two malicious devices. To detect large-scale attacks, suck as
self-promoting and bad-mouthing, we propose a network embeddings community

effectiveness of Trust2Vec is validated through large-scale IoT network

sample size $n$ and dimension $p$ are both increasing such that $p/n$ has a
finite limit, the behavior of the empirical distribution of $\hat\beta$ and the
predicted values $X\hat\beta$ has been previously characterized in a number of
models: The empirical distributions are known to converge to proximal operators
of the loss and penalty in a related Gaussian sequence model, which captures
the interplay between ratio $p/n$, loss, regularization and the data generating
process. This connection between$(\hat\beta,X\hat\beta)$ and the corresponding
proximal operators require solving fixed-point equations that typically involve
unobservable quantities such as the prior distribution on the index or the link
function.
  This paper develops a different theory to describe the empirical distribution
of $\hat\beta$ and $X\hat\beta$: Approximations of $(\hat\beta,X\hat\beta)$ in
terms of proximal operators are provided that only involve observable
adjustments. These proposed observable adjustments are data-driven, e.g., do
not require prior knowledge of the index or the link function. These new
adjustments yield confidence intervals for individual components of the index,
as well as estimators of the correlation of $\hat\beta$ with the index. The
interplay between loss, regularization and the model is thus captured in a
data-driven manner, without solving the fixed-point equations studied in

study of such systems is complicated by the presence of point defects on the

the form of polarons. This can affect the stability, the electronic
configuration, and the local geometry of the adsorbed adatoms. In this work,
through the use of density functional theory and surface-sensitive experiments,
we study the adsorption of Rh1, Pt1, and Au1 metals on the reduced TiO2(110)
surface; a prototypical polaronic material. A systematic analysis of the
adsorption configurations and oxidation states of the adsorbed metals reveals
different types of couplings between adsorbates and polarons. As confirmed by
scanning tunneling microscopy measurements, the favored Pt1 and Au1 adsorption
at oxygen vacancy sites is associated with a strong electronic charge transfer
from polaronic states to adatom orbitals, which results in a reduction of the
adsorbed metal. In contrast, the Rh1 adatoms interact weakly with the excess
charge, which leaves the polarons largely unaffected. Our results show that an
accurate understanding of the properties of single-atom catalysts on oxide

spectral features, instead of raw signals, as its inputs. We first studied the
""importance"" issue of signal modalities using the RF algorithm. We found that
ECG contributed most to the important features and EMG second, among the four
signal modalities. We then studied the accuracy performance of the proposed
machine learning models. We verified that the multi-channel DL-R model, which
took raw signals as its inputs, outperformed all other models, with its
sensitivity and specificity scores both being above 95 %. This accuracy
performance is on a par with those published results which dealt with fewer
types of sleep disorders. We adopted two popular heatmap-generating techniques,
with which we confirmed that the DL model's superior performance was owing to
the CNN network's ability to extract potent features from raw signals.

""double-path"" ferroelectrics), characterized by two competing polarization
switching paths for which the change in polarization is different and in fact
of opposite sign. Depending on which path is favorable under given conditions,
this leads to different identification of up- and down-polarized states. Since
the sign of piezoelectric response depends on the assignment of up- or
down-polarized state for a specific structure, this means that the material can
exhibit different signs of the piezoelectric response under different
conditions. We focus on HfO$_2$ as a key example. Our first-principles
calculations show that there are two competing paths in HfO$_2$, resulting from
different displacements of the atoms from the initial to the final structures,
and the change in polarization along these two paths is of opposite sign. These
results provide a natural explanation for the recently observed discrepancy in
the signs of piezoelectric responses in HfO$_2$ between theoretical
first-principles calculations and experimental observation. Further, this
allows predictions of how to favor one path over another by changes in
conditions and compositional tuning. This family of materials also includes
other candidates, such as CuInP$_2$S$_6$ and theoretically proposed
LaVO$_3$-SrVO$_3$ superlattice. We finally note that double-path ferroelectrics
possess novel electromechanical properties since the signs of their
piezoelectric responses can be switched.

in diagnosing glaucoma from a single optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3D scan
of the optic nerve head (ONH); (2) To compare its performance to that obtained
with a standard 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), and with a gold-standard
glaucoma parameter, i.e. retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness.
  Methods: 3D raster scans of the ONH were acquired with Spectralis OCT for 477
glaucoma and 2,296 non-glaucoma subjects at the Singapore National Eye Centre.
All volumes were automatically segmented using deep learning to identify 7
major neural and connective tissues including the RNFL, the prelamina, and the
lamina cribrosa (LC). Each ONH was then represented as a 3D point cloud with
1,000 points chosen randomly from all tissue boundaries. To simplify the
problem, all ONH point clouds were aligned with respect to the plane and center
of Bruch's membrane opening. Geometric deep learning (PointNet) was then used
to provide a glaucoma diagnosis from a single OCT point cloud. The performance
of our approach was compared to that obtained with a 3D CNN, and with RNFL
thickness.
  Results: PointNet was able to provide a robust glaucoma diagnosis solely from
the ONH represented as a 3D point cloud (AUC=95%). The performance of PointNet
was superior to that obtained with a standard 3D CNN (AUC=87%) and with that
obtained from RNFL thickness alone (AUC=80%).
  Discussion: We provide a proof-of-principle for the application of geometric
deep learning in the field of glaucoma. Our technique requires significantly
less information as input to perform better than a 3D CNN, and with an AUC
superior to that obtained from RNFL thickness alone. Geometric deep learning
may have wide applicability in the field of Ophthalmology.

detection of hate speech is becoming a crucial task and has attracted attention

tweets) that contain hateful information. The peculiarities of languages in
social media, such as short and poorly written content, lead to the difficulty
of learning semantics and capturing discriminative features of hate speech.
Previous studies have utilized additional useful resources, such as sentiment
hashtags, to improve the performance of hate speech detection. Hashtags are
added as input features serving either as sentiment-lexicons or extra context
information. However, our close investigation shows that directly leveraging
these features without considering their context may introduce noise to
classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to leverage sentiment
hashtags to enhance hate speech detection in a natural language inference
framework. We design a novel framework SRIC that simultaneously performs two
tasks: (1) semantic relation inference between online posts and sentiment
hashtags, and (2) sentiment classification on these posts. The semantic
relation inference aims to encourage the model to encode sentiment-indicative
information into representations of online posts. We conduct extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our

computing, hardware problems of noise, decoherence, and scaling, software
problems of error correction, and, most important, algorithm construction.
Finding truly quantum algorithms is quite difficult, and many quantum
algorithms, like Shor prime factoring or phase estimation, require extremely
long circuit depth for any practical application, necessitating error
correction. Machine learning can be used as a systematic method to
nonalgorithmically program quantum computers. Quantum machine learning enables
us to perform computations without breaking down an algorithm into its gate
building blocks, eliminating that difficult step and potentially reducing
unnecessary complexity. In addition, we have shown that our machine learning
approach is robust to both noise and to decoherence, which is ideal for running
on inherently noisy NISQ devices which are limited in the number of qubits
available for error correction. We demonstrated this using a fundamentally non
classical calculation, experimentally estimating the entanglement of an unknown
quantum state. Results from this have been successfully ported to the IBM
hardware and trained using a powerful hybrid reinforcement learning technique
which is a modified Levenberg Marquardt LM method. The LM method is ideally
suited to quantum machine learning as it only requires knowledge of the final
measured output of the quantum computation, not intermediate quantum states
which are generally not accessible. Since it processes all the learning data
simultaneously, it also requires significantly fewer hits on the quantum
hardware. Machine learning is demonstrated with results from simulations and

technology. DNA synthesis, which refers to the task of writing the data into
DNA, is perhaps the most costly part of existing storage systems. Accordingly,
this high cost and low throughput limits the practical use in available DNA
synthesis technologies. It has been found that the homopolymer run (i.e., the
repetition of the same nucleotide) is a major factor affecting the synthesis
and sequencing errors. Quite recently, [26] studied the role of batch
optimization in reducing the cost of large scale DNA synthesis, for a given
pool $\mathcal{S}$ of random quaternary strings of fixed length. Among other
things, it was shown that the asymptotic cost savings of batch optimization are
significantly greater when the strings in $\mathcal{S}$ contain repeats of the
same character (homopolymer run of length one), as compared to the case where
strings are unconstrained.
  Following the lead of [26], in this paper, we take a step forward towards the
theoretical understanding of DNA synthesis, and study the homopolymer run of
length $k\geq1$. Specifically, we are given a set of DNA strands $\mathcal{S}$,
randomly drawn from a natural Markovian distribution modeling a general
homopolymer run length constraint, that we wish to synthesize. For this
problem, we prove that for any $k\geq 1$, the optimal reference strand,
minimizing the cost of DNA synthesis is, perhaps surprisingly, the periodic
sequence $\overline{\mathsf{ACGT}}$. It turns out that tackling the homopolymer
constraint of length $k\geq2$ is a challenging problem; our main technical
contribution is the representation of the DNA synthesis process as a certain
constrained system, for which string techniques can be applied.

representations (spectrograms) on the recognition performance and adversarial
attack robustness of a victim residual convolutional neural network, namely
ResNet-18. Our main motivation for focusing on such a front-end classifier
rather than other complex architectures is balancing recognition accuracy and
the total number of training parameters. Herein, we measure the impact of
different settings required for generating more informative Mel-frequency
cepstral coefficient (MFCC), short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and discrete
wavelet transform (DWT) representations on our front-end model. This
measurement involves comparing the classification performance over the
adversarial robustness. We demonstrate an inverse relationship between
recognition accuracy and model robustness against six benchmarking attack
algorithms on the balance of average budgets allocated by the adversary and the
attack cost. Moreover, our experimental results have shown that while the
ResNet-18 model trained on DWT spectrograms achieves a high recognition
accuracy, attacking this model is relatively more costly for the adversary than
other 2D representations. We also report some results on different
convolutional neural network architectures such as ResNet-34, ResNet-56,
AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, SB-CNN, and LSTM-based.

simulation of mineral dissolution at the pore-scale. The traditional VoS
formulation (VoS-psi) uses a diffuse interface localization function psi to
ensure stability and limit diffusion of the reactive surface. The main
limitation of this formulation is that accuracy is strongly dependent on the
choice of the localization function. Our first novel improved formulation
(iVoS) uses the divergence of a reactive flux to localize the reaction at the
fluid-solid interface, so no localization function is required. Our second
novel formulation (VoS-psi') uses a localization function with a parameter that
is fitted to ensure that the reactive surface area is conserved globally. Both
novel methods are validated by comparison with experiments, numerical
simulations using an interface tracking method based on the Arbitrary Eulerian
Lagrangian (ALE) framework, and numerical simulations using the VoS-psi. All
numerical methods are implemented in GeoChemFoam, our reactive transport
toolbox and three benchmark test cases in both synthetic and real pore
geometries are considered: (1) dissolution of a calcite post by acid injection
in a microchannel and experimental comparison, (2) dissolution in a 2D
polydisperse disc micromodel at different dissolution regimes and (3)
dissolution in a Ketton carbonate rock sample and comparison to
\textit{in-situ} micro-CT experiments. We find that the iVoS results match
accurately experimental results and simulation results obtained with the ALE
method, while the VoS-psi method leads to inaccuracies that are mostly
corrected by the VoS-psi' formulation. In addition, the VoS methods are
significantly faster than the ALE method, with a speed-up factor of between 2

potential-flux div LSFEM with Crouzeix-Raviart (CR) element approximation, we
present three proofs of the discrete solvability under the condition that mesh
size is small enough. One of the proof is based on the coerciveness of the
original bilinear form. The other two are based on the minimal assumption of
the uniqueness of the solution of the second-order elliptic equation. A
counterexample shows that div least-squares functional does not have norm
equivalence in the sum space of $H^1$ and CR finite element spaces. Thus it
cannot be used as an a posteriori error estimator. Several versions of reliable
and efficient error estimators are proposed for the method. We also propose a
three-filed potential-flux-intensity div-curl least-squares method with general
nonconforming finite element approximations. The norm equivalence in the
abstract nonconforming piecewise $H^1$-space is established for the three-filed
formulation on the minimal assumption of the uniqueness of the solution of the

by incorporating case weights into a modeling procedure. Intuitively, models
fitted with different weight schemes would have a different level of complexity
depending on how well the weights match the inverse of error variances.
However, existing statistical theories on model complexity, also known as model
degrees of freedom, were primarily established under the assumption of equal
error variances. In this work, we focus on linear regression procedures and
seek to extend the existing measures to a heteroscedastic setting. Our analysis
of the weighted least squares method reveals some interesting properties of the
extended measures. In particular, we find that they depend on both the weights
used for model fitting and those for model evaluation. Moreover, modeling
heteroscedastic data with optimal weights generally results in fewer degrees of
freedom than with equal weights, and the size of reduction depends on the
unevenness of error variance. This provides additional insights into weighted
modeling procedures that are useful in risk estimation and model selection.

show how CCSA can learn efficient parallel inverted index thanks to an

method and we propose to combine it with the recent graph based ANN techniques.
Our experiments on MSMARCO dataset reveal that CCSA outperforms IVF with
product quantization. Furthermore, CCSA binary quantization is beneficial for
the index size, and memory usage for the graph-based HNSW method, while

  Federated Distillation","32 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm in
which the server periodically aggregates local model parameters from clients
without assembling their private data. Constrained communication and
personalization requirements pose severe challenges to FL. Federated
distillation (FD) is proposed to simultaneously address the above two problems,
which exchanges knowledge between the server and clients, supporting
heterogeneous local models while significantly reducing communication overhead.
However, most existing FD methods require a proxy dataset, which is often
unavailable in reality. A few recent proxy-data-free FD approaches can
eliminate the need for additional public data, but suffer from remarkable
discrepancy among local knowledge due to client-side model heterogeneity,
leading to ambiguous representation on the server and inevitable accuracy
degradation. To tackle this issue, we propose a proxy-data-free FD algorithm
based on distributed knowledge congruence (FedDKC). FedDKC leverages
well-designed refinement strategies to narrow local knowledge differences into
an acceptable upper bound, so as to mitigate the negative effects of knowledge
incongruence. Specifically, from perspectives of peak probability and Shannon
entropy of local knowledge, we design kernel-based knowledge refinement (KKR)
and searching-based knowledge refinement (SKR) respectively, and theoretically
guarantee that the refined-local knowledge can satisfy an approximately-similar
distribution and be regarded as congruent. Extensive experiments conducted on
three common datasets demonstrate that our proposed FedDKC significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art (Top-1 accuracy boosts by up to 4.38%, and
Top-5 accuracy boosts by up to 10.31%) on various heterogeneous settings while
evidently improving the convergence speed.

the first step, a distributed control law is designed for the nominal

the second step, an extra control input, depending on some carefully chosen
residual signals indicating the modeling mismatch, is designed to complement
the H2 performance by providing robustness guarantee in terms of H_infty
requirement with respect to disturbances or uncertainties. The proposed
complementary design approach provides an additional degree of freedom for
design, having two separate controls to deal with the H2 performance and the
robustness of consensus, respectively. Thereby, it does not need to make much
trade-off, and can be expected to be much less conservative than the trade-off
design such as the mixed H2/H_infty control method. Besides, this complementary
approach will recover the achievable H2 performance when external disturbances
or uncertainties do not exist. The effectiveness of the theoretical results and
the advantages of the complementary approach are validated via numerical

thicknesses have been investigated using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM)
and temperature-programmed desorption. Three desorption stages are observed
belonging to amorphous solid water (ASW), stacking disordered ice I (ice Isd),
and hexagonal ice I (ice Ih). The desorption of ASW is only visible for the >10
micrometre films and is separated from the ice I desorption by 10-15 K and has
an associated desorption energy of 64 kJ mol-1. The desorption energy of the 53
nanometre film was found to be near 50 kJ mol-1 as also noted in the
literature, but with increasing film thickness the desorption energy of ice I
rises until reaching a plateau around 65-70 kJ mol-1. The reason for the
increased desorption energy is suggested to be due to molecules unable to
desorb due to the thick covering layer of H2O and possibly re-adsorption.
Before complete desorption of ice I which occurs around 220 K for the 100
micrometre film, a two-stage ice I desorption is observed with the QCM for the
10 and 20 micrometre films near 200 K. This event corresponds to the desorption
of ice Isd as corroborated by X-ray diffraction patterns collected upon heating
from 92-260 K at ambient pressure. Cubic ice is not observed as is commonly
stated in the literature as resulting from the crystallisation of ASW.
Therefore, ice Isd is the correct terminology for the initial crystallisation
product of ASW.

observations of young stars surrounded by dusty disks have had difficulties
disentangling planet and extended disk emission. We analyse VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS
SAM observations of the transition disk LkCa\,15, model the extended disk
emission, probe for planets at small separations, and improve contrast limits
for planets. We fit geometrical models directly to the interferometric
observables and recover previously observed extended disk emission. We use
dynamic nested sampling to estimate uncertainties on our model parameters and
to calculate evidences to perform model comparison. We compare our extended
disk emission models against point source models to robustly conclude that the
system is dominated by extended emission within 50 au. We report detections of
two previously observed asymmetric rings at $\sim$17 au and $\sim$45 au. The
peak brightness location of each model ring is consistent with the previous
observations. We also, for the first time with imaging, robustly recover an
elliptical Gaussian inner disk, previously inferred via SED fitting. This inner
disk has a FWHM of ~5 au and a similar inclination and orientation as the outer
rings. Finally, we recover no clear evidence for candidate planets. By
modelling the extended disk emission, we are able to place a lower limit on the
near infrared companion contrast of at least 1000.

We simulate 24 models of healthy, perfused tissue and perfusion-deprived tissue

wavelengths of light. In addition to detailed fluence maps of photon
propagation, we propose a simple mathematical model to assess the differential
propagation of photons in tissue; the optical reperfusion factor (ORF). Our

of a multi-wavelength, point-of-care diagnostics device and inform its design

require understanding of how the chemical synaptic signal is sensed and
transduced at the synaptic receiver (Rx). While signal reception in synaptic
molecular communication (SMC) depends heavily on the kinetics of the receptors
employed by the synaptic Rxs, existing channel models for SMC either
oversimplify the receptor kinetics or employ complex, high-dimensional kinetic

diffusion, and degradation of neurotransmitters as well as their reversible
binding to finitely many generic postsynaptic receptors. The proposed SMC model
is the first that allows studying the impact of the characteristic dynamics of

called a generalized star of lines. Both constructions have later been
simplified by the author. Here we refine our simplified approach in order to
obtain similar results for regular parallelisms of oriented lines. As a
consequence, we can demonstrate that for oriented parallelisms, as we call

stochastic with a Gaussian distribution. The sensor measurements at each agent
are linear and corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise. Under such
settings, this paper presents a novel distributed estimation algorithm that
fuses the the concepts of consensus and innovations by incorporating the
consensus terms (of neighboring estimates) into the innovation terms. Under the
assumption of distributed parameter observability, introduced in this paper, we
design the optimal gain matrices such that the distributed estimates are
consistent and achieves fast convergence.

How","Backward Reachability Analysis for Neural Feedback Loops","8 pages, 5 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing prevalence of neural networks (NNs) in safety-critical
applications calls for methods to certify their behavior and guarantee safety.
This paper presents a backward reachability approach for safety verification of
neural feedback loops (NFLs), i.e., closed-loop systems with NN control
policies. While recent works have focused on forward reachability as a strategy
for safety certification of NFLs, backward reachability offers advantages over
the forward strategy, particularly in obstacle avoidance scenarios. Prior works
have developed techniques for backward reachability analysis for systems
without NNs, but the presence of NNs in the feedback loop presents a unique set
of problems due to the nonlinearities in their activation functions and because
NN models are generally not invertible. To overcome these challenges, we use
existing forward NN analysis tools to find affine bounds on the control inputs
and solve a series of linear programs (LPs) to efficiently find an
approximation of the backprojection (BP) set, i.e., the set of states for which
the NN control policy will drive the system to a given target set. We present
an algorithm to iteratively find BP set estimates over a given time horizon and
demonstrate the ability to reduce conservativeness in the BP set estimates by
up to 88% with low additional computational cost. We use numerical results from
a double integrator model to verify the efficacy of these algorithms and
demonstrate the ability to certify safety for a linearized ground robot model
in a collision avoidance scenario where forward reachability fails.

Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA), to include the free energy contributions
due to quasiparticle interactions. We show that, for semiconductors and
insulators, the EPI contributions to the free energies of electrons and phonons
are the corresponding zero-point energy contributions. Using an approximate
version of Allen's formalism in combination with the Allen-Heine theory for EPI
corrections, we calculate the zero-point EPI corrections to the total energy
for cubic and hexagonal polytypes of Carbon, Silicon and Silicon Carbide. The
EPI corrections alter the energy differences between polytypes. In SiC
polytypes, the EPI correction term is more sensitive to crystal structure than
the vdW and ZPVE terms and is thus essential in determining their energy
differences. It clearly establishes that the cubic SiC-3C is metastable and
hexagonal SiC-4H is the stable polytype. Our results are consistent with the
experimental results of Kleykamp. Our study enables the inclusion of EPI
corrections as a separate term in the free energy expression. This opens the
way to go beyond the QHA by including the contribution of EPI on all
thermodynamic properties.

goals, ethnicity, age, social and emotional characteristics, course load and
work schedule, offers unique opportunities in education, like learning new
skills, peer mentoring and example setting. But student diversity can be
challenging too as it adds variability in the way in which students learn and
progress over time. A single teaching approach is likely to be ineffective and
result in students not meeting their potential. Automated support could address
limitations of traditional teaching by continuously assessing student learning
and implementing needed interventions. This paper discusses a novel methodology
based on data analytics and Machine Learning to measure and causally diagnose
the progress and shortcomings of student learning, and then utilizes the
insight gained on individuals to optimize learning. Diagnosis pertains to
dynamic diagnostic formative assessment, which aims to uncover the causes of
learning shortcomings. The methodology groups learning difficulties into four
categories: recall from memory, concept adjustment, concept modification, and
problem decomposition into sub-goals (sub-problems) and concept combination.
Data models are predicting the occurrence of each of the four challenge types,
as well as a student's learning trajectory. The models can be used to
automatically create real-time, student-specific interventions (e.g., learning
cues) to address less understood concepts. We envision that the system will
enable new adaptive pedagogical approaches to unleash student learning
potential through customization of the course material to the background,
abilities, situation, and progress of each student; and leveraging
diversity-related learning experiences.

orthogonal subspaces $ \mathcal{A} $ and $ \mathcal {B} $:
$\mathbf{L}_{2}(G)=\mathcal{A}\oplus \mathcal{B}$. In turn, $ \mathcal{A}=
\mathcal{A}_H\oplus \mathbf{A}^0$ and $\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{B}_H \oplus
\mathbf{V}^0$, where $\mathcal{A}_H $ and $\mathcal{B}_H $ are null spaces of

  Consciousness","Annual Meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of
  Consciousness 2022",,,,"cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Having a rich multimodal inner language is an important component of human
intelligence that enables several necessary core cognitive functions such as
multimodal prediction, translation, and generation. Building upon the Conscious
Turing Machine (CTM), a machine model for consciousness proposed by Blum and
Blum (2021), we describe the desiderata of a multimodal language called
Brainish, comprising words, images, audio, and sensations combined in
representations that the CTM's processors use to communicate with each other.
We define the syntax and semantics of Brainish before operationalizing this
language through the lens of multimodal artificial intelligence, a vibrant
research area studying the computational tools necessary for processing and
relating information from heterogeneous signals. Our general framework for
learning Brainish involves designing (1) unimodal encoders to segment and
represent unimodal data, (2) a coordinated representation space that relates
and composes unimodal features to derive holistic meaning across multimodal
inputs, and (3) decoders to map multimodal representations into predictions
(for fusion) or raw data (for translation or generation). Through discussing
how Brainish is crucial for communication and coordination in order to achieve
consciousness in the CTM, and by implementing a simple version of Brainish and
evaluating its capability of demonstrating intelligence on multimodal
prediction and retrieval tasks on several real-world image, text, and audio
datasets, we argue that such an inner language will be important for advances
in machine models of intelligence and consciousness.

proactive HARQ protocol for beyond 5G networks. Based on Lyapunov stochastic
optimization, our adaptation control framework dynamically selects the number
of proactive retransmissions for intermittent URLLC traffic scenarios under
time-varying channel conditions without requiring any prior knowledge
associated with this stochastic process. It then better exploits the trade-off
between Radio Access Network (RAN) latency, reliability and resource
efficiency, which is still limited in its realization on current HARQ designs.
We then evaluate the performance of several HARQ strategies and show that our
proposal further improves latency over the reactive regime without affecting
the resource efficiency such as fixed proactive retransmission while
maintaining target reliability.
