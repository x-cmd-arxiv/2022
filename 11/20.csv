power, mobility, and dexterity. Technologies for measuring muscle tissue
motion, such as sonomicrometry, fluoromicrometry, and ultrasound, have
significantly advanced our understanding of biomechanics. Yet, the field lacks
the ability to monitor muscle tissue motion for animal behavior outside the
lab. Towards addressing this issue, we previously introduced magnetomicrometry,
a method that uses magnetic beads to wirelessly monitor muscle tissue length
changes, and we validated magnetomicrometry via tightly-controlled in situ
testing. In this study we validate the accuracy of magnetomicrometry against
fluoromicrometry during untethered running in an in vivo turkey model. We
demonstrate real-time muscle tissue length tracking of the freely-moving
turkeys executing various motor activities, including ramp ascent and descent,
vertical ascent and descent, and free roaming movement. Given the demonstrated
capacity of magnetomicrometry to track muscle movement in untethered animals,
we feel that this technique will enable new scientific explorations and an
improved understanding of muscle function. -- -- El tejido muscular es el motor

benefit various artificial intelligence applications, such as question
answering and recommendations. Meanwhile, contrastive learning (CL), as an
effective mechanism to enhance the discriminative capacity of the learned
representations, has been leveraged in different fields, especially graph-based
models. However, since the structures of knowledge graphs (KGs) are usually
more complicated compared to homogeneous graphs, it is hard to construct
appropriate contrastive sample pairs. In this paper, we find that the entities
within a symmetrical structure are usually more similar and correlated. This
key property can be utilized to construct contrastive positive pairs for
contrastive learning. Following the ideas above, we propose a relational
symmetrical structure based knowledge graph contrastive learning framework,
termed KGE-SymCL, which leverages the symmetrical structure information in KGs
to enhance the discriminative ability of KGE models. Concretely, a
plug-and-play approach is designed by taking the entities in the relational
symmetrical positions as the positive samples. Besides, a self-supervised
alignment loss is used to pull together the constructed positive sample pairs
for contrastive learning. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets

approximation of underlying measures by discrete measures. However, it is
sometimes relevant to work only with moments of measures instead of the measure
itself, and many common OT problems can be formulated as moment problems (the
most relevant examples being $L^p$-Wasserstein distances, barycenters, and
Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancies on Euclidean spaces). We leverage this fact to
develop a generalized moment formulation that covers these classes of OT
problems. The transport plan is represented through its moments on a given
basis, and the marginal constraints are expressed in terms of moment
constraints. A practical computation then consists in considering a truncation
of the involved moment sequences up to a certain order, and using the
polynomial sums-of-squares hierarchy for measures supported on semi-algebraic
sets. We prove that the strategy converges to the solution of the OT problem as
the order increases. We also show how to approximate linear quantities of

computed moments using Christoffel-Darboux kernels. Numerical experiments
illustrate the good behavior of the approach.

astrophysics. In particular, binary white dwarfs are associated with Type Ia
supernovae, used as standard candles to measure the expansion of the Universe.
Today, compact-star mergers are typically studied via state-of-the-art
computational fluid dynamics codes. One such numerical techniques, Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), is frequently chosen for its excellent mass,
energy, and momentum conservation. Furthermore, the natural treatment of vacuum
and the ability to represent highly irregular morphologies make SPH an
excellent tool for the numerical study of compact-star binaries and mergers.
However, for many scenarios, including binary systems, the outcome simulations
are only as accurate as the initial conditions. For SPH, it is essential to
ensure that particles are distributed semi-regularly, correctly representing
the initial density profile. Additionally, particle noise in the form of
high-frequency local motion and low-frequency global dynamics must be damped
out. Damping the latter can be as computationally intensive as the actual
simulation. Here, we discuss a new and straightforward relaxation method,
Halted-Pendulum Relaxation (HPR), to remove the global oscillation modes of SPH
particle configurations. In combination with effective external potentials
representing gravitational and orbital forces, we show that HPR has an
excellent performance in efficiently relaxing SPH particles to the desired
density distribution and removing global oscillation modes. We compare the
method to frequently used relaxation approaches such as gravitational glass,
increased artificial viscosity, and Weighted Voronoi Tesselations, and test it
on a white dwarf binary model at its Roche lobe overflow limit.

has poor delay performance. A low-cost approach to improve this delay
performance is to favor shorter paths by incorporating pre-defined biases in
the BP computation, such as a bias based on the shortest path (hop) distance to
the destination. In this work, we improve upon the widely-used metric of hop
distance (and its variants) for the shortest path bias by introducing a bias
based on the link duty cycle, which we predict using a graph convolutional

formula for the natural logarithm and a proof concerning the H\""older mean
based on the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function. We find a
harmonic mean analogue of Chebyshev's inequality for the prime counting
function involving the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Furthermore, we define a
function taking the H\""older mean of all positive integers up to a given number
and investigate its asymptotic behavior, finding two different patterns which
are separated by the harmonic mean. Additionally, we discuss the behavior of
said function at zero and discover a formula involving the Riemann zeta
function, whose continuity we prove with Riemann's functional equation.
Inspired by the alternating harmonic series, we find a double series formula
for the natural logarithm, resulting in identities involving the Riemann zeta
function, binomial coefficients, and logarithms.

research to improve the robustness of models. However, due to the huge
computational cost of generating adversarial samples, adversarial training
methods are often slow. In this paper, we study the problem of learning a
robust dataset such that any classifier naturally trained on the dataset is
adversarially robust. Such a dataset benefits the downstream tasks as natural
training is much faster than adversarial training, and demonstrates that the
desired property of robustness is transferable between models and data. In this
work, we propose a principled, tri-level optimization to formulate the robust
dataset learning problem. We show that, under an abstraction model that
characterizes robust vs. non-robust features, the proposed method provably
learns a robust dataset. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and
TinyImageNet demostrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with different
network initializations and architectures.

communication, several works have adopted learning-based approaches to solve
the channel estimation problem. While these methods are usually promoted for
their computational efficiency at inference time, their use is restricted to
specific stationary training settings in terms of communication system
parameters, e.g., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and coherence time. Therefore,
the performance of these learning-based solutions will degrade when the models
are tested on different settings than the ones used for training. This
motivates our work in which we investigate continual supervised learning (CL)
to mitigate the shortcomings of the current approaches. In particular, we
design a set of channel estimation tasks wherein we vary different parameters
of the channel model. We focus on Gauss-Markov Rayleigh fading channel
estimation to assess the impact of non-stationarity on performance in terms of
the mean square error (MSE) criterion. We study a selection of state-of-the-art
CL methods and we showcase empirically the importance of catastrophic
forgetting in continuously evolving channel settings. Our results demonstrate
that the CL algorithms can improve the interference performance in two channel
estimation tasks governed by changes in the SNR level and coherence time.

  Exploiting Image and Event Modalities",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present HALSIE, a novel hybrid approach for semantic segmentation by
simultaneously leveraging image and event modalities. Event cameras are vision
sensors that detect changes in per-pixel intensity to generate asynchronous
'event streams'. They offer significant advantages over standard frame-based
cameras due to their higher dynamic range, higher temporal resolution, and lack
of motion blur. However, events only measure the varying component of the
visual signal, which limits their ability to encode scene context. To augment
the missing contextual information, we postulate that fusing spatially dense
frames with temporally dense events can generate semantic maps with
fine-grained predictions. Prior work in event-based vision has achieved
outstanding performance but with substantial inference cost, typically beyond
50 mJ per cycle. By redesigning the end-to-end learning framework, we reduce
inference cost by up to $\sim 20\times$ while retaining similar performance. To
achieve this, our method efficiently extracts and fuses the complementary
features, exploiting the best of both modalities. In particular, HALSIE
comprises dual-encoders with a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) branch to provide
rich temporal cues from asynchronous events, and a standard Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) branch for extracting spatial information from regular frame data
to enable cross-domain learning. Our hybrid network reaches state-of-the-art
performance on real-world DDD-17, MVSEC and DSEC-Semantic datasets with up to
$\sim 33\times$ higher parameter efficiency and favorable inference cost
(17.9mJ per cycle), making it suitable for resource-constrained edge
applications. Further, the effectiveness of design choices in our approach is
evidenced by our thorough ablation study.

scenarios for prohibited item detection, especially for deliberately hidden
items. In specific, PIDray collects 124,486 X-ray images for $12$ categories of
prohibited items, and each image is manually annotated with careful inspection,
which makes it, to our best knowledge, to largest prohibited items detection
dataset to date. Meanwhile, we propose a general divide-and-conquer pipeline to
develop baseline algorithms on PIDray. Specifically, we adopt the tree-like
structure to suppress the influence of the long-tailed issue in the PIDray
dataset, where the first course-grained node is tasked with the binary
classification to alleviate the influence of head category, while the
subsequent fine-grained node is dedicated to the specific tasks of the tail
categories. Based on this simple yet effective scheme, we offer strong
task-specific baselines across object detection, instance segmentation, and
multi-label classification tasks and verify the generalization ability on
common datasets (e.g., COCO and PASCAL VOC). Extensive experiments on PIDray
demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against current
state-of-the-art methods, especially for deliberately hidden items. Our
benchmark and codes will be released at https://github.com/lutao2021/PIDray.

of Twitter conversations. First, we examine how the presence of others in a
conversation can potentially diffuse Twitter users' responsibility to address a
toxic direct reply. Second, we examine whether the toxicity of the first direct
reply to a toxic tweet in conversations establishes the group norms for
subsequent replies. By doing so, we outline how bystanders and the tone of
initial responses to a toxic reply are explanatory factors which affect whether
others feel uninhibited to post their own abusive or derogatory replies. We
test this premise by analyzing a random sample of more than 156k tweets
belonging to ~9k conversations. Central to this work is the social
psychological research on the ""bystander effect"" documenting that the presence
of bystanders has the power to alter the dynamics of a social situation. If the
first direct reply reaffirms the divisive tone, other replies may follow suit.
We find evidence of a bystander effect, with our results showing that an
increased number of users participating in the conversation before receiving a
toxic tweet is negatively associated with the number of Twitter users who
responded to the toxic reply in a non-toxic way. We also find that the initial
responses to toxic tweets within conversations is of great importance. Posting
a toxic reply immediately after a toxic comment is negatively associated with
users posting non-toxic replies and Twitter conversations becoming increasingly
toxic.

the years. The interest in researching and developing computational tools for
the acquisition, storage, organization, analysis, and visualization of
biological data generates the need to create new hardware architectures and new
software tools that allow processing big data in acceptable times. In this
sense, heterogeneous computing takes an important role in providing solutions
but at the same time generates new challenges for developers in relation to the
impossibility of porting source code between different architectures.
  Methods. Intel has recently introduced oneAPI, a new unified programming
environment that allows code developed in the SYCL-based Data Parallel C++
(DPC++) language to be run on different devices such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs,
among others. Due to the large amount of CUDA software in the field of
bioinformatics, this paper presents the migration process of the SW\# suite, a
biological sequence alignment tool developed in CUDA, to DPC++ through the
oneAPI compatibility tool dpc (recently renowned as SYCLomatic).
  Results. SW\# has been completely migrated with a small programmer
intervention in terms of hand-coding. Moreover, it has been possible to port
the migrated code between different architectures (considering different target
platforms and vendors), with no noticeable performance degradation.
  Conclusions. The SYCLomatic tool presented a great performance-portability
rate. SYCL and Intel oneAPI can offer attractive opportunities for the
Bioinformatics community, especially considering the vast existence of
CUDA-based legacy codes.

given in terms of the Euler angles $(\theta,\phi,\psi)$ that define a rotation
in $SO(3)$, and the Euclidean norm in ${\mathbb R}^3$. Following a classical
work by Schwinger, $2$-dimensional harmonic oscillators are used to produce
raising and lowering operators that change the total angular momentum
eigenvalue of the wave functions in half units. The nature of the
representation space $\mathcal H$ is approached from the double covering group
homomorphism $SU(2)\to SO(3)$ and the topology involved is taken care of by
using the Hurwitz-Hopf map $H:{\mathbb R}^4\to{\mathbb R}^3$. It is shown how
to reconsider $H$ as a 2-to-1 group map, $G_0={\mathbb R}^+\times SU(2)\to
{\mathbb R}^+\times SO(3)$, translating it into an assignment $(z_1,z_2)\mapsto
(r,\theta,\phi,\psi)$ whose domain consists of pairs $(z_1,z_2)$ of complex
variables. It is shown how the Lie algebra of $G_0$ is coupled with two
Heisenberg Lie algebras of $2$-dimensional (Schwinger's) harmonic oscillators
generated by the operators $\{z_1,z_2,\bar{z}_1,\bar{z}_2\}$ and their
adjoints. The whole set of operators gets algebraically closed either into a
$13$-dimensional Lie algebra or into a $(4|8)$-dimensional Lie superalgebra.
The wave functions in $\mathcal H$ can be written in terms of polynomials in
the complex coordinates $(z_1,z_2)$ and their complex conjugates, and the
representations are explicitly constructed via the various highest weight (or
lowest weight) vector representations of $G_0$. A new non-relativistic quantum
(Schr\""odinger-like) equation for the hydrogen atom that takes into account the

algorithm to solve distributed machine-learning tasks over wirelessly-connected
systems, without the coordination of a base station. It combines local
stochastic gradient descent steps with a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA)
consensus scheme at the receivers, that enables concurrent transmissions by
leveraging the waveform superposition properties of the wireless channels. With
NCOTA, local optimization signals are mapped to a mixture of orthogonal
preamble sequences and transmitted concurrently over the wireless channel under
half-duplex constraints. Consensus is estimated by non-coherently combining the
received signals with the preamble sequences and mitigating the impact of noise
and fading via a consensus stepsize. NCOTA-DSGD operates without channel state
information (typically used in over-the-air computation schemes for channel
inversion) and leverages the channel pathloss to mix signals, without explicit
knowledge of the mixing weights (typically known in consensus-based
optimization). It is shown that, with a suitable tuning of decreasing consensus
and learning stepsizes, the error (measured as Euclidean distance) between the
local and globally optimum models vanishes with rate $\mathcal O(k^{-1/4})$
after $k$ iterations. NCOTA-DSGD is evaluated numerically by solving an image
classification task on the MNIST dataset, cast as a regularized cross-entropy
loss minimization. Numerical results depict faster convergence vis-\`a-vis
running time than implementations of the classical DSGD algorithm over digital

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2202.09389",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have drawn significant attentions over the years
and been broadly applied to essential applications requiring solid robustness
or vigorous security standards, such as product recommendation and user
behavior modeling. Under these scenarios, exploiting GNN's vulnerabilities and
further downgrading its performance become extremely incentive for adversaries.
Previous attackers mainly focus on structural perturbations or node injections
to the existing graphs, guided by gradients from the surrogate models. Although
they deliver promising results, several limitations still exist. For the
structural perturbation attack, to launch a proposed attack, adversaries need
to manipulate the existing graph topology, which is impractical in most
circumstances. Whereas for the node injection attack, though being more
practical, current approaches require training surrogate models to simulate a
white-box setting, which results in significant performance downgrade when the
surrogate architecture diverges from the actual victim model. To bridge these
gaps, in this paper, we study the problem of black-box node injection attack,
without training a potentially misleading surrogate model. Specifically, we
model the node injection attack as a Markov decision process and propose
Gradient-free Graph Advantage Actor Critic, namely G2A2C, a reinforcement
learning framework in the fashion of advantage actor critic. By directly
querying the victim model, G2A2C learns to inject highly malicious nodes with
extremely limited attacking budgets, while maintaining a similar node feature
distribution. Through our comprehensive experiments over eight acknowledged
benchmark datasets with different characteristics, we demonstrate the superior

  journal Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies non-smooth problems of convex stochastic optimization.
Using the smoothing technique based on the replacement of the function value at
the considered point by the averaged function value over a ball (in $l_1$-norm
or $l_2$-norm) of small radius with the center in this point, the original
problem is reduced to a smooth problem (whose Lipschitz constant of the
gradient is inversely proportional to the radius of the ball). An important
property of the smoothing used is the possibility to calculate an unbiased
estimation of the gradient of a smoothed function based only on realizations of
the original function. The obtained smooth stochastic optimization problem is
proposed to be solved in a distributed federated learning architecture (the
problem is solved in parallel: nodes make local steps, e.g. stochastic gradient
descent, then they communicate - all with all, then all this is repeated). The
goal of this paper is to build on the current advances in gradient-free
non-smooth optimization and in feild of federated learning, gradient-free
methods for solving non-smooth stochastic optimization problems in federated
learning architecture.

over space and time. We offer a set of tools to illuminate such change
temporally, at desired temporal resolution, and spatially, according to region
of interest, using data generated from suitable space-time models. These tools
include predictive spatial probability surfaces and spatial extents for an
event. Working with exceedance events around the center of the temperature
distribution, the probability surfaces capture the spatial variation in the
risk of an exceedance event, while the spatial extents capture the expected
proportion of incidence of a given exceedance event for a region of interest.
Importantly, the proposed tools can be used with the output from any suitable
model fitted to any set of spatially referenced time series data.
  As an illustration, we employ a dataset from 1956 to 2015 collected at 18
stations over Arag\'{o}n in Spain, and a collection of daily maximum
temperature series obtained from posterior predictive simulation of a Bayesian
hierarchical daily temperature model. The results for the summer period show
that although there is an increasing risk in all the events used to quantify
the effects of climate change, it is not spatially homogeneous, with the
largest increase arising in the center of Ebro valley and Eastern Pyrenees
area. The risk of an increase of the average temperature between 1966-1975 and
2006-2015 higher than $1^\circ$C is higher than 0.5 all over the region, and
close to 1 in the previous areas. The extent of daily temperature higher than
the reference mean has increased 3.5% per decade. The mean of the extent
indicates that 95% of the area under study has suffered a positive increment of
the average temperature, and almost 70% higher than $1^{\circ}$C.

non-linear relation between ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities. We consider
this relation both in its original form and corrected for selection biases and

the circularity problem. We also explore two approaches: with and without

cosmological models and a flat $w$CDM model, with a constant dark energy
equation of state parameter $w$. Remarkably, when correcting for the evolution
as a function of cosmology, we obtain closed constraints on $\Omega_M$ using

halfway between the one from SNe Ia and CMB, paving the way for new insights

practical usability is limited by model mismatch and the immense computational
complexity associated with the analytical computation of perturbation triplets

have been used to optimise parameters of PB-based approaches, which
traditionally have been determined analytically from physical models. It has
been claimed in the literature that the learned PB-NLC approaches have improved

learned PB-NLC approaches by carefully carrying out a comprehensive
performance-complexity analysis utilizing state-of-the-art complexity reduction

PB-NLC by proposing and designing a fully learned structure. We apply a
bi-directional recurrent neural network for learning perturbation triplets that
are alike those obtained from the analytical computation and are used as input
features for the neural network to estimate the nonlinearity distortion field.
Finally, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that our proposed fully

Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as the most promising approach for

requiring large datasets to train the neural networks. The data collection
procedure is costly and laborious, requiring extensive measurements and
labeling processes for different indoor environments. The situation can be
improved by Data Augmentation (DA), a general framework to enlarge the datasets

capabilities. This paper proposes two simple yet surprisingly effective DA
algorithms for channel state information (CSI) based indoor localization
motivated by physical considerations. We show that the number of measurements
for a given accuracy requirement may be decreased by an order of magnitude.
Specifically, we demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness by experiments
conducted with a measured indoor WiFi measurement dataset. As little as 10% of
the original dataset size is enough to get the same performance as the original
dataset. We also showed that if we further augment the dataset with the
proposed techniques, test accuracy is improved more than three-fold.

shortest possible path to their destination. This change is such that
pedestrians have a different feeling of time at any point and moment in the
environment. Based on this feeling, they adjust their route to the destination
so that they travel the shortest possible route in curved spacetime, which
follows a geodesic. The contributions are :1. Defining spacetime metric for
pedestrian movement.2. Visualizing the spacetime geometry for several
timesteps.3. Introducing a parameter called the time factor and its physical
meaning in terms of the pedestrian feeling of time. According to this paper

proposed to implement kernels in the form of neural networks of a specific form
called the neural kernels. The conditional average treatment effect is
estimated by using the survival functions as outcomes of the control and

experimental approach to dealing with such unbalanced datasets by including
humans in the training process. We ask humans to rank the importance of
features of the dataset, and through rank aggregation, determine the initial

efficient inference, while time-consuming training is still unavoidable. In

the issue, this paper aims to introduce sparsity into data and proposes an
end-to-end efficient training framework from three sparse perspectives, dubbed
Tri-Level E-ViT. Specifically, we leverage a hierarchical data redundancy
reduction scheme, by exploring the sparsity under three levels: number of
training examples in the dataset, number of patches (tokens) in each example,
and number of connections between tokens that lie in attention weights. With
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed technique can
noticeably accelerate training for various ViT architectures while maintaining
accuracy. Remarkably, under certain ratios, we are able to improve the ViT
accuracy rather than compromising it. For example, we can achieve 15.2% speedup

routing and scheduling of vehicles is highly dependent on supply-demand
dynamics at a closer to real-time temporal resolution. We propose a
utility-based transit route-choice model with representation of within-day
adaptive travel behavior and between-day learning where station-based
fixed-transit, flexible-transit, and active-mode alternatives may be
dynamically combined in a single path. To enable experimentation, this
route-choice model is implemented within an agent-based dynamic public transit
simulation framework. Model properties are first explored in a choice between
fixed- and flexible-transit modes for a toy network. The framework is then
applied to illustrate level-of-service trade-offs and analyze traveler mode
choices within a mixed fixed- and flexible transit system in a case study based
on a real-life branched transit service in Stockholm, Sweden.

(a) the magnetic activities of the Be star and its disk and (b) the accretion
from the Be star to an unidentified compact object. Among such sources, Pi Aqr
plays a pivotal role as it is one of the only two spectroscopic binaries
observed for many orbital cycles and one of the three sources with X-ray
brightness sufficient for detailed X-ray spectroscopy. Bjorkman et al. (2002)
estimated the secondary mass > 2.0 Mo with optical spectroscopy, which would
argue against the compact object being a white dwarf (WD). However, their
dynamical mass solution is inconsistent with an evolutionary solution and their
radial velocity measurement is inconsistent with later work by Naze et al.
(2019). We revisit this issue by adding a new data set with the NuSTAR X-ray
observatory and the HIDES echelle spectrograph. We found that the radial
velocity amplitude is consistent with Naze et al. (2019), which is only a half
of that claimed by Bjorkman et al. (2002). Fixing the radial velocity amplitude
of the primary, the secondary mass is estimated as < 1.4 Mo over an assumed
range of the primary mass and the inclination angle. We further constrained the
inclination angle and the secondary mass independently by fitting the X-ray
spectra with a non-magnetic or magnetic accreting WD model under the assumption
that the secondary is indeed a WD. The two results match well. We thus argue
that the possibility of the secondary being a WD should not be excluded for pi
Aqr.

angular momentum transport in astrophysical disks. However, despite many
efforts, a direct experimental evidence of MRI in laboratory is still missing.
Recently, performing 1D linear analysis of the standard version of MRI (SMRI)
between two rotating coaxial cylinders with an axial magnetic field, we showed
that SMRI can be detected in the upcoming DRESDYN-MRI experiment with
cylindrical magnetized Taylor-Couette (TC) flow with liquid sodium. In this
follow-up study related to DRESDYN-MRI experiments, we focus on the nonlinear
evolution and saturation properties of SMRI and analyze its scaling behavior
with respect to various parameters of the basic TC flow. We do an analysis over
the extensive ranges of magnetic Reynolds number $Rm\in [8.5, 37.1]$, Lundquist
number $Lu\in[1.5, 15.5]$ and Reynolds number, $Re\in[10^3, 10^5]$. For fixed
$Rm$, we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of SMRI for small magnetic Prandtl
numbers down to $Pm\sim O(10^{-4})$, aiming for values typical of liquid
sodium. In the saturated state, the magnetic energy of SMRI and associated
torque on the cylinders, characterizing angular momentum transport, both
increase with $Rm$ for fixed $(Lu, Re)$, while for fixed $(Lu, Rm)$, the
magnetic energy decreases and torque increases with increasing $Re$. We also
study the scaling of the magnetic energy and torque as a function of $Re$ and
find a power law dependence $Re^{-0.6...-0.5}$ for the magnetic energy and
$Re^{0.4...0.5}$ for the torque at all sets of $(Lu,Rm)$ and high $Re\geq
4000$. We also explore the dependence on Lundquist number and angular velocity.
The scaling laws derived here will be instrumental in the subsequent analysis
and comparison of numerical results with those obtained from the DRESDYN-MRI
experiments in order to conclusively and unambiguously identify SMRI in
laboratory.

the dissipative particle dynamics method, we design solid liquid interfaces,
confining a pure liquid between two explicit solid surfaces with different
roughness degrees. The roughness of the solid phase was characterized by Wenzel
roughness factor and the effective SL IFT ({\gamma}_sl^') is reported as a
function of it also. Two solid liquid systems differentiated from each other by
their solid liquid repulsion strength are studied to measure the effects caused
by the surface roughness on the calculation of {\gamma}_sl^'. We found that the
roughness produces changes in the structure of the liquid, which is observed in
the first layer of liquid near the solid. These changes are responsible for the
effective SL IFT increase as surface roughness increases. Although there is a
predominance of surface roughness in the calculation of {\gamma}_sl^', it is
found that the effective SL IFT is directly proportional to the magnitude of
the solid liquid repulsion strength. The insights provided by these simulations
suggest that the increase of Wenzel roughness factor is a direct consequence of
the increase in surface area due to the vertical deviations measured in the
topography. This, in turn, produces an increase in the number of effective
solid liquid interactions between particles, eventually yielding significant
changes in the local values of the normal and tangential components of the
pressure tensor.

Singular solutions in general relativity are well known. The Schwarschild

collapse in general relativity for compact masses exceeding $3M_{\odot }$. A

correspondences from a target subject to a base subject. As the most well-known
computational method of analogical reasoning, Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT)
abstracts both target and base subjects into relational graphs and forms the
cognitive process of analogical reasoning by finding a corresponding subgraph
(i.e., correspondence) in the target graph that is aligned with the base graph.
However, incorporating deep learning for SMT is still under-explored due to
several obstacles: 1) the combinatorial complexity of searching for the
correspondence in the target graph; 2) the correspondence mining is restricted
by various cognitive theory-driven constraints. To address both challenges, we
propose a novel framework for Analogical Reasoning (DeepGAR) that identifies
the correspondence between source and target domains by assuring cognitive
theory-driven constraints. Specifically, we design a geometric constraint
embedding space to induce subgraph relation from node embeddings for efficient
subgraph search. Furthermore, we develop novel learning and optimization
strategies that could end-to-end identify correspondences that are strictly
consistent with constraints driven by the cognitive theory. Extensive
experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DeepGAR over existing methods.

currents) that produce desired neural responses, e.g., for inducing therapeutic

model-driven. Due to challenges inherent in modeling neural responses
accurately, data-driven approaches offer an attractive alternative. The problem
of data-driven stimulus design can be thought of as estimating an inverse of a
non-linear ``forward"" mapping, which takes in as inputs the stimulus parameters
and outputs the corresponding neural responses. In most cases of interest, the
forward mapping is many-to-one, and hence difficult to invert using traditional
methods. Existing methods estimate the inverse by using conditional density
estimation methods or numerically inverting an estimated forward mapping, but
both approaches tend to perform poorly at small sample sizes. In this work, we
develop a new optimization framework called PATHFINDER, which allows us to use
regression methods for estimating an inverse mapping. We use toy examples to
illustrate key aspects of PATHFINDER, and show, on computational models of
biological neurons, that PATHFINDER can outperform existing methods at small
sample sizes. The data-efficiency of PATHFINDER is especially valuable in
stimulus design as collecting data is expensive in this domain.

networks where not all nodes are excited or not all nodes are measured. One key
contribution of that paper was to establish a set of necessary conditions on
the excitation and measurement pattern (EMP) that guarantee generic
identifiability. In a nutshell, these conditions established that all sources
must be excited and all sinks measured, and that all other nodes must be either
excited or measured. In the present paper, we show that two other types of
nodes, which are defined by the local topology of the network, play an
essential r\^ole in the search for a valid EMP, i.e. one that guarantees
generic identifiability. We have called these nodes dources and dinks. We show
that a network is generically identifiable only if, in addition to the above
mentioned conditions, all dources are excited and all dinks are measured. We
also show that sources and dources are the only nodes in a network that always
need to be excited, and that sinks and dinks are the only nodes that need to be
measured for an EMP to be valid.

the motion fulfils additional conservation laws, such as conservation of energy

multi-fidelity Monte Carlo method that optimally balances the costs of training
low-fidelity models with the costs of Monte Carlo sampling. It generalizes the
previously developed context-aware bi-fidelity Monte Carlo method to
hierarchies of multiple models and to more general types of low-fidelity
models. When training low-fidelity models, the proposed approach takes into
account the context in which the learned low-fidelity models will be used,
namely for variance reduction in Monte Carlo estimation, which allows it to
find optimal trade-offs between training and sampling to minimize upper bounds
of the mean-squared errors of the estimators for given computational budgets.
This is in stark contrast to traditional surrogate modeling and model reduction
techniques that construct low-fidelity models with the primary goal of
approximating well the high-fidelity model outputs and typically ignore the
context in which the learned models will be used in upstream tasks. The
proposed context-aware multi-fidelity Monte Carlo method applies to hierarchies
of a wide range of types of low-fidelity models such as sparse-grid and
deep-network models. Numerical experiments with the gyrokinetic simulation code

on local timescale estimates via ratios of the real parts of eigenvalues of the
Jacobian near critical manifolds. This approach modifies the one introduced by

theory. While parameters derived by this method cannot provide universal
quantitative estimates for the accuracy of a reduction, they represent a
critical first step toward this end. Working directly with eigenvalues is
generally unfeasible, and at best cumbersome. Therefore we focus on the

them to timescales. Thus, we obtain distinguished parameters for systems of
arbitrary dimension, with particular emphasis on reduction to dimension one. As
a first application, we discuss the Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism system

investigate more complex enzyme catalyzed reaction mechanisms (uncompetitive,
competitive inhibition and cooperativity) of dimension three, with reductions

workhorse for simulations of multi-modal distributions. The key to the success

(DEO) scheme exploits the non-reversibility property and has successfully
reduced the communication cost from $O(P^2)$ to $O(P)$ given sufficiently many
$P$ chains. However, such an innovation largely disappears in big data due to
the limited chains and few bias-corrected swaps. To handle this issue, we
generalize the DEO scheme to promote non-reversibility and propose a few
solutions to tackle the underlying bias caused by the geometric stopping time.
Notably, in big data scenarios, we obtain an appealing communication cost
$O(P\log P)$ based on the optimal window size. In addition, we also adopt
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with large and constant learning rates as

retrieval, where document representations are used to perform effective and
efficient semantic search. However, DR remains challenging on long documents,
due to the quadratic complexity of its Transformer-based encoder and the finite
capacity of a low-dimension embedding. Current DR models use suboptimal
strategies such as truncating or splitting-and-pooling to long documents
leading to poor utilization of whole document information. In this work, to
tackle this problem, we propose Segment representation learning for long
documents Dense Retrieval (SeDR). In SeDR, Segment-Interaction Transformer is
proposed to encode long documents into document-aware and segment-sensitive
representations, while it holds the complexity of splitting-and-pooling and
outperforms other segment-interaction patterns on DR. Since GPU memory
requirements for long document encoding causes insufficient negatives for DR
training, Late-Cache Negative is further proposed to provide additional cache
negatives for optimizing representation learning. Experiments on MS MARCO and
TREC-DL datasets show that SeDR achieves superior performance among DR models,
and confirm the effectiveness of SeDR on long document retrieval.

Schwarzschild black hole, and we find that it agrees well with previous

leading order contribution to the condensate is much larger (in most of space)

chiral symmetry is directly proportional to the size of the black hole. Next,
we apply this perturbative method to a Reissner-Nordstr\""om (RN) black hole. We
find that, as the charge-to-mass ratio increases, the bubble of restored chiral
symmetry becomes larger relative to the black hole. This effect is particularly
pronounced for near-extremal RN black holes. The case of an extremal RN black
hole provides an interesting counterexample to the standard thermal explanation

is possible to define a flexible self-preserving system that does not use a
reward signal or reward-maximization as an objective. We achieve this by
introducing the Self-Preserving Agent (SPA) with a physiological structure
where the system can get trapped in an absorbing state if the agent does not
solve and execute goal-directed polices. Our agent is defined using new class
of Bellman equations called Operator Bellman Equations (OBEs), for encoding
jointly non-stationary non-Markovian tasks formalized as a Temporal Goal Markov
Decision Process (TGMDP). OBEs produce optimal goal-conditioned spatiotemporal
transition operators that map an initial state-time to the final state-times of
a policy used to complete a goal, and can also be used to forecast future
states in multiple dynamic physiological state-spaces. SPA is equipped with an
intrinsic motivation function called the valence function, which quantifies the
changes in empowerment (the channel capacity of a transition operator) after
following a policy. Because empowerment is a function of a transition operator,
there is a natural synergism between empowerment and OBEs: the OBEs create
hierarchical transition operators, and the valence function can evaluate
hierarchical empowerment change defined on these operators. The valence
function can then be used for goal selection, wherein the agent chooses a
policy sequence that realizes goal states which produce maximum empowerment
gain. In doing so, the agent will seek freedom and avoid internal death-states
that undermine its ability to control both external and internal states in the
future, thereby exhibiting the capacity of predictive and anticipatory
self-preservation. We also compare SPA to Multi-objective RL, and discuss its
capacity for symbolic reasoning and life-long learning.

  (NeurIPS 2022)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning new task-specific skills from a few trials is a fundamental
challenge for artificial intelligence. Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL)
tackles this problem by learning transferable policies that support few-shot
adaptation to unseen tasks. Despite recent advances in meta-RL, most existing
methods require the access to the environmental reward function of new tasks to
infer the task objective, which is not realistic in many practical
applications. To bridge this gap, we study the problem of few-shot adaptation
in the context of human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning. We develop a
meta-RL algorithm that enables fast policy adaptation with preference-based
feedback. The agent can adapt to new tasks by querying human's preference
between behavior trajectories instead of using per-step numeric rewards. By
extending techniques from information theory, our approach can design query
sequences to maximize the information gain from human interactions while
tolerating the inherent error of non-expert human oracle. In experiments, we
extensively evaluate our method, Adaptation with Noisy OracLE (ANOLE), on a
variety of meta-RL benchmark tasks and demonstrate substantial improvement over
baseline algorithms in terms of both feedback efficiency and error tolerance.

macroeconomic models. The analysis of Emerging Markets (EM) economies generally
assumes collateral borrowing constraints, i.e., firms access to debt is
constrained by the value of their collateralized assets. Using credit registry
data from Argentina for the period 1998-2020 we show that less than 15% of
firms debt is based on the value of collateralized assets, with the remaining
85% based on firms cash flows. Exploiting central bank regulations over banks
capital requirements and credit policies we argue that the most prevalent
borrowing constraints is defined in terms of the ratio of their interest
payments to a measure of their present and past cash flows, akin to the
interest coverage borrowing constraint studied by the corporate finance
literature. Lastly, we argue that EMs exhibit a greater share of interest
sensitive borrowing constraints than the US and other Advanced Economies. From
a structural point of view, we show that in an otherwise standard small open
economy DSGE model, an interest coverage borrowing constraints leads to
significantly stronger amplification of foreign interest rate shocks compared
to the standard collateral constraint. This greater amplification provides a
solution to the Spillover Puzzle of US monetary policy rates by which EMs
experience greater negative effects than Advanced Economies after a US interest
rate hike. In terms of policy implications, this greater amplification leads to
managed exchange rate policy being more costly in the presence of an interest
coverage constraint, given their greater interest rate sensitivity, compared to
the standard collateral borrowing constraint.

state-of-the-art results in many generative tasks, outperforming GANs and other

various image generation sub-tasks, among which conditional generation tasks
such as text-guided image synthesis. Given the success of DDPMs in 2D
generation, they have more recently been applied to 3D shape generation,

However, these existing 3D DDPM works make little or no use of guidance, mainly
being unconditional or class-conditional. In this work, we present IC3D, an
Image-Conditioned 3D Diffusion model that generates 3D shapes by image
guidance. To guide our DDPM, we introduce CISP (Contrastive Image-Shape
Pre-training), a model jointly embedding images and shapes by contrastive
pre-training, inspired by the literature on text-to-image DDPMs. Our generative
diffusion model outperforms the state-of-the-art in 3D generation quality and
diversity. Furthermore, despite IC3D generative nature, we show that its
generated shapes are preferred by human evaluators to a SoTA single-view 3D
reconstruction model in terms of quality and coherence to the query image by
running a side-by-side human evaluation. Ablation studies show the importance
of CISP for learning structural integrity properties, crucial for realistic

interpolation and conditioning on out-of-distribution images, while also making
IC3D capable of generating coherent but diverse completions of occluded views

of the generator to maximize the mutual information between the input and
generated images, which does not exert an active effect on the decoder part. In
addition, though negative samples play a crucial role in CL, most existing
methods adopt a random sampling strategy, which may be less effective. In this
paper, we rethink the CL paradigm in the unpaired I2I tasks from two
perspectives and propose a new one-sided image translation framework called
EnCo. First, we present an explicit constraint on the multi-scale pairwise
features between the encoder and decoder of the generator to guarantee the
semantic consistency of the input and generated images. Second, we propose a
discriminative attention-guided negative sampling strategy to replace the
random negative sampling, which significantly improves the performance of the
generative model with an almost negligible computational overhead. Compared
with existing methods, EnCo acts more effective and efficient. Extensive

full exact diagonalization is adopted to study the zero temperature phase

studies using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We then study the
non-equilibrium quench dynamics of the spin and charge order parameters by
fixing the initial and final Coulomb interaction while changing the quenching
time protocols. The Lanczos method allows us to reach longer times following
the quench than DMRG. Our study shows that the time evolution of the charge and
spin order parameters strongly depend on the quenching time protocols. In
particular, the effective temperature of the system will decrease monotonically
as the quenching time is increased. Finally, by taking the final Coulomb
interaction strength to be in the strong coupling regime, we find that the
oscillation frequency of the charge order parameter increases monotonically
with the Coulomb interaction. By contrast, the frequency of the spin order
parameter decreases monotonically with increasing Coulomb interaction. We
explain this result using an effective spin model in the strong coupling limit.

heterogeneous client data. Local training on non-iid distributed data results
in deflected local optimum, which causes the client models drift further away

natural solution is to gather all client data onto the server, such that the
server has a global view of the entire data distribution. Unfortunately, this
reduces to regular training, which compromises clients' privacy and conflicts
with the purpose of FL. In this paper, we put forth an idea to collect and
leverage global knowledge on the server without hindering data privacy. We
unearth such knowledge from the dynamics of the global model's trajectory.
Specifically, we first reserve a short trajectory of global model snapshots on
the server. Then, we synthesize a small pseudo dataset such that the model
trained on it mimics the dynamics of the reserved global model trajectory.
Afterward, the synthesized data is used to help aggregate the deflected clients
into the global model. We name our method Dynafed, which enjoys the following
advantages: 1) we do not rely on any external on-server dataset, which requires
no additional cost for data collection; 2) the pseudo data can be synthesized
in early communication rounds, which enables Dynafed to take effect early for
boosting the convergence and stabilizing training; 3) the pseudo data only
needs to be synthesized once and can be directly utilized on the server to help
aggregation in subsequent rounds. Experiments across extensive benchmarks are
conducted to showcase the effectiveness of Dynafed. We also provide insights

Then we formulate two constraints on part prototypes to ensure their

synthesize unknown features as representatives of unknown samples by mixing up
part composite features of different classes. We conduct experiments on three

defined in three aspects, namely, transferability, interpretability, and
robustness. While solutions have been frequently addressed regarding the three
challenges, the general reliability of a detection model has been barely
considered, leading to the lack of reliable evidence in real-life usages and
even for prosecutions on Deepfake-related cases in court. We, therefore,
introduce a model reliability study metric using statistical random sampling
knowledge and the publicly available benchmark datasets to review the
reliability of the existing detection models on arbitrary Deepfake candidate
suspects. Case studies are further executed to justify the real-life Deepfake
cases including different groups of victims with the help of the reliably
qualified detection models as reviewed in this survey. Reviews and experiments
upon the existing approaches provide informative discussions and future
research directions of Deepfake detection.

and recently in RS the ensemble of multiple deep neural networks (DNNs) has
shown state-of-the-art performances. However, such an ensemble brings heavy
computation burdens in both training and certification, and yet under-exploits
individual DNNs and their mutual effects, as the communication between these
classifiers is commonly ignored in optimization. In this work, starting from a
single DNN, we augment the network with multiple heads, each of which pertains
a classifier for the ensemble. A novel training strategy, namely Self-PAced
Circular-TEaching (SPACTE), is proposed accordingly. SPACTE enables a circular
communication flow among those augmented heads, i.e., each head teaches its
neighbor with the self-paced learning using smoothed losses, which are
specifically designed in relation to certified robustness. The deployed
multi-head structure and the circular-teaching scheme of SPACTE jointly
contribute to diversify and enhance the classifiers in augmented heads for
ensemble, leading to even stronger certified robustness than ensembling
multiple DNNs (effectiveness) at the cost of much less computational expenses
(efficiency), verified by extensive experiments and discussions.

exploits the semantic correlation of between the movement of the facial

video based approaches is the presence of blurriness around the key facial
regions such as mouth and lips - where spatial displacement is much higher in
comparison to other areas. The proposed approach explicitly defines a lip
reading loss to learn the fine grain motion in these facial areas. During
training, GANs have potential to fit frequencies from low to high, which leads
to miss the hard to synthesize frequencies. Therefore, to add salient frequency

Our U-FNOs can reliably predict the spatiotemporal variations of groundwater

important literature in this space, to the best of our knowledge, no results
formalize a relationship between certain parallel and distributed graph

\emph{locally adjustable} graph algorithms and show that algorithms of this
type can be transformed into differentially private algorithms.
  Our formalization is motivated by a set of results that we present in the
central and local models of differential privacy for a number of problems,
including $k$-core decomposition, low out-degree ordering, and densest
subgraphs. First, we design an $\varepsilon$-edge differentially private (DP)
algorithm that returns a subset of nodes that induce a subgraph of density at
least $\frac{D^*}{1+\eta} - O\left(\text{poly}(\log n)/\varepsilon\right),$
where $D^*$ is the density of the densest subgraph in the input graph (for any
constant $\eta > 0$). This algorithm achieves a two-fold improvement on the
multiplicative approximation factor of the previously best-known private
densest subgraph algorithms while maintaining a near-linear runtime.
  Then, we present an $\varepsilon$-locally edge differentially private (LEDP)
algorithm for $k$-core decompositions. Our LEDP algorithm provides approximates
the core numbers (for any constant $\eta > 0$) with $(2+\eta)$ multiplicative
and $O\left(\text{poly}\left(\log n\right)/\varepsilon\right)$ additive error.
This is the first differentially private algorithm that outputs private

point cloud analysis tasks, e.g., classification and semantic segmentation.
Since point cloud data is sparse and irregularly distributed, one key issue for
point cloud data processing is extracting useful information from local
regions. To achieve this, previous works mainly extract the points' features
from local regions by learning the relation between each pair of adjacent
points. However, these works ignore the relation between edges in local
regions, which encodes the local shape information. Associating the
neighbouring edges could potentially make the point-to-point relation more
aware of the local structure and more robust. To explore the role of the
relation between edges, this paper proposes a novel Adaptive Edge-to-Edge
Interaction Learning module, which aims to enhance the point-to-point relation
through modelling the edge-to-edge interaction in the local region adaptively.
We further extend the module to a symmetric version to capture the local
structure more thoroughly. Taking advantage of the proposed modules, we develop
two networks for segmentation and shape classification tasks, respectively.
Various experiments on several public point cloud datasets demonstrate the

However, existing SRAM-based TRNGs suffer from 1) low TRNG throughput, 2) high

results in random access failures when the supply voltage is reduced below the
manufacturer-recommended supply voltage. TuRaN generates random numbers at high
throughput by repeatedly accessing SRAM cells with reduced supply voltage and
post-processing the resulting random faults using the SHA-256 hash function. To
demonstrate the feasibility of TuRaN, we conduct SPICE simulations on different
process nodes and analyze the potential of access failure for use as an entropy
source. We verify and support our simulation results by conducting real-world
experiments on two commercial off-the-shelf FPGA boards. We evaluate the

\emph{Adversarial Training (AT)} is a successful approach to learning a robust

  Under the best-effort model, characterizing the distribution of quality of

decreases. This dependence can be explained by the change of trapped fraction
and drift-orbit width with I_p. The fast ion current decreases with the
increase of plasma density n_e. This dependence is related to the variation of
the slowing-down time with n_e, which is already well known and is confirmed in
our specific situation. The electron shielding effect to the fast ion current
is taken into account by using a fitting formula applicable to general tokamak
equilibria and arbitrary collisionality regime. The dependence of the net
current on the plasma current and density follows the same trend as that of the
fast ion current.

intelligent surface (RIS), it is recently suggested by information theory that
modulating information upon RIS phases is able to send extra information with
increased communication rate. In this paper, we propose a novel superimposed
RIS-phase modulation (SRPM) scheme to transfer extra messages by superimposing
information-bearing phase offsets to conventionally optimized RIS phases. The
proposed SRPM is interpreted as a universal framework for RIS phase modulation.
Theoretical union bound of the average bit error rate (ABER) of the proposed
SRPM is also derived with the maximum likelihood (ML) detection. The diversity
order is characterized as 0.5 for all parameter settings, which is useful for
determining the optimal choice of the phase modulation parameters. Furthermore,
we discover that doubling the number of either RIS reflecting elements or the
transmit antennas is equivalent to a 3 dB increment in the transmit power for
SRPM. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRPM and reveal that
it achieves reliable communication of more bits than existing schemes.

dynamic relations, shows promising prospects in event forecasting. However,
most temporal knowledge graph reasoning methods are highly dependent on the
recurrence or periodicity of events, which brings challenges to inferring
future events related to entities that lack historical interaction. In fact,
the current moment is often the combined effect of a small part of historical
information and those unobserved underlying factors. To this end, we propose a
new event forecasting model called Contrastive Event Network (CENET), based on
a novel training framework of historical contrastive learning. CENET learns
both the historical and non-historical dependency to distinguish the most
potential entities that can best match the given query. Simultaneously, it
trains representations of queries to investigate whether the current moment
depends more on historical or non-historical events by launching contrastive
learning. The representations further help train a binary classifier whose
output is a boolean mask to indicate related entities in the search space.
During the inference process, CENET employs a mask-based strategy to generate
the final results. We evaluate our proposed model on five benchmark graphs. The
results demonstrate that CENET significantly outperforms all existing methods
in most metrics, achieving at least $8.3\%$ relative improvement of Hits@1 over

two-dimensional second-order topological insulators and superconductors. In
this work, we show that the existence of sublattice degrees of freedom can
enrich the tunability of bound states on the boundary and hence lift the
constraint on their locations. We take the Kane-Mele model with
honeycomb-lattice structure to illustrate the underlying physics. With the
introduction of an in-plane exchange field to the model, we find that the
boundary Dirac mass induced by the exchange field has a sensitive dependence on
the boundary sublattice termination. We find that the sensitive sublattice
dependence can lead bound states to emerge at a specific type of boundary
defects named as sublattice domain walls if the exchange field is of
ferromagnetic nature, even in the absence of any sharp corner on the boundary.
Remarkably, this sensitive dependence of the boundary Dirac mass on the
boundary sublattice termination allows the positions of bound states to be
manipulated to any place on the boundary for an appropriately-designed sample.
With a further introduction of conventional s-wave superconductivity to the
model, we find that, no matter whether the exchange field is ferromagnetic,
antiferromagnetic, or ferrimagnetic, highly controllable Majorana zero modes
can be achieved at the sublattice domain walls. Our work reshapes the
understanding of boundary physics in second-order topological phases, and
meanwhile opens potential avenues to realize highly controllable bound states

over time. Motivated by this, we propose TSEXPLAIN, a system that explains
aggregated time series by surfacing the underlying evolving top contributors.
Under the hood, we leverage prior works on two-relations diff as a building
block and formulate a K-Segmentation problem to segment the time series such
that each segment after segmentation shares consistent explanations, i.e.,
contributors. To quantify consistency in each segment, we propose a novel
within-segment variance design that is explanation-aware; to derive the optimal
K-Segmentation scheme, we develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our
explanation-aware segmentation can effectively identify evolving explanations
for aggregated time series and outperform explanation-agnostic segmentation.
Further, we proposed an optimal selection strategy of K and several
optimizations to speed up TSEXPLAIN for interactive user experience, achieving
up to 13X efficiency improvement.

cluster defined by a radius, and at a time; this mass cross is translated into
a differential equation that it can be integrated for a given radius (r) and a
determined time (t). From this equation we can derive the different time scales
that allows us to reach conclusions like: clusters not containing blue
strugglers (BS) stars disappear younger than those clusters containing BS. In
clusters containing BS stars, the volume which takes up half of the cluster
mass is bigger than the one corresponding to clusters without BS stars but the
time to catch it up is shorter. We also studied, by means of this equation, the
core collapse of stars of the cluster and the region where this concentration
is stopped/retained; this region is identified by means of the relation $c/ch$,
being $c=\log(rt/rc)$ and $ch=\log(rc/rh)$. Where rt and rc are the tidal and
the core radius respectively, and rh is the radius where half of the cluster
mass is concentrated. The model also drove us to the conclusion that the number
of the blue straggler stars in a cluster follows a distribution function whose
components are the ratio between relaxation time and the age, labelled as $\it
f$, and a factor, named $\varpi$, which is an indicator of the origin of the
BS; $\varpi$ increases as the number of BS increase but it is limited

direction was consistent with propagation along {100} type planes.
High-resolution EBSD showed significant crystal lattice rotation, hence
consequential plastic deformation, concentrated between the main crack tip and

ductile ridges. A discontinuous mechanism, involving re-initiation of new

automated deep learning has emerged as a potential tool that releases the

manipulation traces. However, we argue that those models achieve sub-optimal
detection performance as it tends to: 1) distinguish the manipulation traces
from a lot of noisy information within the entire image, and 2) ignore the
trace relations among the pixels of each manipulated region and its
surroundings. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Auto-Focus
Contrastive Learning (AF-CL) network for image manipulation detection. It
contains two main ideas, i.e., multi-scale view generation (MSVG) and trace
relation modeling (TRM). Specifically, MSVG aims to generate a pair of views,
each of which contains the manipulated region and its surroundings at a
different scale, while TRM plays a role in modeling the trace relations among
the pixels of each manipulated region and its surroundings for learning the
discriminative representation. After learning the AF-CL network by minimizing
the distance between the representations of corresponding views, the learned
network is able to automatically focus on the manipulated region and its

manipulation detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the

Technically, a global-local transformer (GLT) module is employed to integrate
object- and patch-aware prior into seed point features to effectively form
strong feature representation for geometric positions of the seed points, thus
providing more robust and accurate cues for offset learning. Subsequently, a
simple yet effective training strategy is designed to train the GLT module. We
develop an importance prediction branch to learn the potential importance of
the seed points and treat the output weights vector as a training constraint

The five-body unbound $1^-$ states of $^8$He are obtained with the complex

the strengths arise from the soft dipole mode of four neutrons ($4n$)

soft dipole resonance for this state by carefully searching for the resonance
pole and finally predict the corresponding resonance with the excitation energy

semantic segmentation (WSSS). The CAM of convolution neural networks fails to
capture long-range feature dependency on the image and result in the coverage
on only foreground object parts, i.e., a lot of false negatives. An intuitive
solution is ``coupling'' the CAM with the long-range attention matrix of visual
transformers (ViT) We find that the direct ``coupling'', e.g., pixel-wise
multiplication of attention and activation, achieves a more global coverage (on
the foreground), but unfortunately goes with a great increase of false
positives, i.e., background pixels are mistakenly included. This paper aims to
tackle this issue. It proposes a new method to couple CAM and Attention matrix
in a probabilistic Diffusion way, and dub it AD-CAM. Intuitively, it integrates
ViT attention and CAM activation in a conservative and convincing way.
Conservative is achieved by refining the attention between a pair of pixels
based on their respective attentions to common neighbors, where the intuition
is two pixels having very different neighborhoods are rarely dependent, i.e.,
their attention should be reduced. Convincing is achieved by diffusing a
pixel's activation to its neighbors (on the CAM) in proportion to the
corresponding attentions (on the AM). In experiments, our results on two
challenging WSSS benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS~COCO show that AD-CAM as pseudo

Existing backdoor attack methods follow an all-to-one or all-to-all attack
scenario, where all the target classes in the test set have already been seen
in the training set. However, ReID is a much more complex fine-grained open-set
recognition problem, where the identities in the test set are not contained in
the training set. Thus, previous backdoor attack methods for classification are
not applicable for ReID. To ameliorate this issue, we propose a novel backdoor
attack on deep ReID under a new all-to-unknown scenario, called Dynamic
Triggers Invisible Backdoor Attack (DT-IBA). Instead of learning fixed triggers
for the target classes from the training set, DT-IBA can dynamically generate
new triggers for any unknown identities. Specifically, an identity hashing
network is proposed to first extract target identity information from a
reference image, which is then injected into the benign images by image
steganography. We extensively validate the effectiveness and stealthiness of
the proposed attack on benchmark datasets, and evaluate the effectiveness of
several defense methods against our attack.

non-vanishing central extension. Because of this central term, one can make
nonlinear redefinitions of the generators of the algebra so that the pure
supertranslations ($\ell >1$ in a spherical harmonic expansion) and the
logarithmic supertranslations have vanishing brackets with all the Poincar\'e
generators, and, in particular, transform in the trivial representation of the
Lorentz group. The symmetry algebra is then the direct sum of the Poincar\'e
algebra and the infinite-dimensional abelian algebra formed by the pure
supertranslations and the logarithmic supertranslations (with central
extension). The pure supertranslations are thus completely decoupled from the
standard Poincar\'e algebra in the asymptotic symmetry algebra. This implies in
particular that one can provide a definition of the angular momentum which is
manifestly free from supertranslation ambiguities. An intermediate redefinition
providing a partial decoupling of the pure and logarithmic supertranslations is
also given.

multi-party artificial intelligence. Federated learning (FL) and Split Learning
(SL) are two frameworks that enable collaborative learning while keeping the
data private (on device). In FL, each data holder trains a model locally and
releases it to a central server for aggregation. In SL, the clients must
release individual cut-layer activations (smashed data) to the server and wait
for its response (during both inference and back propagation). While relevant
in several settings, both of these schemes have a high communication cost, rely
on server-level computation algorithms and do not allow for tunable levels of
collaboration. In this work, we present a novel approach for privacy-preserving
machine learning, where the clients collaborate via online knowledge
distillation using a contrastive loss (contrastive w.r.t. the labels). The goal
is to ensure that the participants learn similar features on similar classes
without sharing their input data. To do so, each client releases averaged last
hidden layer activations of similar labels to a central server that only acts
as a relay (i.e., is not involved in the training or aggregation of the
models). Then, the clients download these last layer activations (feature
representations) of the ensemble of users and distill their knowledge in their
personal model using a contrastive objective. For cross-device applications
(i.e., small local datasets and limited computational capacity), this approach
increases the utility of the models compared to independent learning and other
federated knowledge distillation (FD) schemes, is communication efficient and
is scalable with the number of clients. We prove theoretically that our
framework is well-posed, and we benchmark its performance against standard FD
and FL on various datasets using different model architectures.

can be regarded as a data augmentation method. Feature Weaken constructs the
vicinal data distribution with the same cosine similarity for model training by
weakening features of the original samples. In especially, Feature Weaken
changes the spatial distribution of samples, adjusts sample boundaries, and
reduces the gradient optimization value of back-propagation. This work can not
only improve the classification performance and generalization of the model,
but also stabilize the model training and accelerate the model convergence. We
conduct extensive experiments on classical deep convolution neural models with
five common image classification datasets and the Bert model with four common

generalization improvement methods, such as Dropout, Mixup, Cutout, and CutMix,
Feature Weaken shows good compatibility and performance. We also use
adversarial samples to perform the robustness experiments, and the results show
that Feature Weaken is effective in improving the robustness of the model.

As a result, the superconducting amplitude fluctuations (i.e. Higgs mode) is
pushed below the quasiparticle continuum, allowing it to become a coherent
excitation observable by Raman scattering. In the present study, we coherently
drive the collective oscillations of the two orders and visualize their
interplay in the driven states in the time domain. We find that both collective

address this generality problem, the denoising diffusion models are first
employed for the microstructure reconstruction task in this study. The
applicability of the diffusion-based models is validated with several types of
microstructures (e.g., polycrystalline alloy, carbonate, ceramics, copolymer,

quality of the generated images is assessed with the quantitative evaluation
metrics (FID score, precision, and recall) and the conventional statistical

adopted to accelerate the sampling process, thereby controlling the
computational cost considering the practicability and reliability. The results
show that the denoising diffusion models are well applicable to the
reconstruction of various types of microstructures with different spatial

a stable training process with simple implementation for generating visually

applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented/virtual reality.
Lately, learning-based methods have shown to be effective for absolute camera
pose estimation. However, these methods are not accurate when generalizing to
different domains. In this paper, a domain adaptive training framework for
absolute pose regression is introduced. In the proposed framework, the scene
image is augmented for different domains by using generative methods to train
parallel branches using Barlow Twins objective. The parallel branches leverage
a lightweight CNN-based absolute pose regressor architecture. Further, the
efficacy of incorporating spatial and channel-wise attention in the regression
head for rotation prediction is investigated. Our method is evaluated with two
datasets, Cambridge landmarks and 7Scenes. The results demonstrate that, even
with using roughly 24 times fewer FLOPs, 12 times fewer activations, and 5
times fewer parameters than MS-Transformer, our approach outperforms all the
CNN-based architectures and achieves performance comparable to
transformer-based architectures. Our method ranks 2nd and 4th with the
Cambridge Landmarks and 7Scenes datasets, respectively. In addition, for
augmented domains not encountered during training, our approach significantly
outperforms the MS-transformer. Furthermore, it is shown that our domain
adaptive framework achieves better performance than the single branch model
trained with the identical CNN backbone with all instances of the unseen
distribution.

a bidder subset selection problem in single-item auctions. In this problem, a
large pool of candidate bidders have independent values sampled from known
prior distributions. The seller needs to pick a subset of bidders and run a
given auction format on the selected subset to maximize her expected revenue.
We propose two frameworks for the subset restrictions: (i) capacity constraint
on the set of selected bidders; and (ii) incurred costs for the bidders invited
to the auction. For the second-price auction with anonymous reserve (SPA-AR),
we give constant approximation polynomial time algorithms in both frameworks
(in the latter framework under mild assumptions about the market). Our results
are in stark contrast to the previous work of Mehta, Nadav, Psomas, Rubinstein

well-studied auction formats such as anonymous posted pricing and sequential
posted pricing. On a technical level, we find that the revenue of SPA-AR as a

submodular. Our bidder selection problem with invitation costs is a natural
question about (approximately) answering a demand oracle for $f(\cdot)$ under a

compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-P1 (NSF-P1) approximation model at low Mach
number, which arises in radiation hydrodynamics, with general initial data and
a parameter $\delta \in [0,2]$ describing the intensity of scatting effect. In
previous literature, only $\delta =2$ and well-prepared initial data case to
the NSF-P1 model was considered. Here we prove that, for partial general
initial data and $\delta =2$, this model converges to the system of low Mach
number heat-conducting viscous flows coupled with a diffusion equation as the
parameter $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. Compared to the classical NSF system, the
NSF-P1 model has additional new singular structures caused by the radiation
pressure. To handle these structures, we construct an equivalent pressure and
an equivalent velocity to balance the order of singularity and establish the
uniform estimates of solutions by designating appropriate weighted norms and
carrying out delicate energy analysis. We then obtain the convergence of the
pressure and velocity from the local energy decay of the equivalent pressure
and equivalent velocity. We also briefly discuss the variations of the limit
equations as the scattering intensity changes, i.e., $\delta \in (0,2)$. We
find that, with the weakening of scattering intensity, the ``diffusion
property"" of radiation intensity gradually weakens. Furthermore, when the
scattering effect is sufficiently weak ($\delta =0$), we can obtain the
singular limits of the NSF-P1 model with general initial data. To our best
knowledge, this is the first result on the influence of scattering intensity in
the non-equilibrium diffusion limit of the NSF-P1 model.

Recently, transfer learning for EEG decoding has been suggested as a remedy and

complications in combining data from many subjects. First, privacy is not
protected as highly personal brain data needs to be shared (and copied across
increasingly tight information governance boundaries). Moreover, BCI data are

using different source data sets obtained from different imagery tasks (e.g.

optical aberration of lenses, providing plentiful information on image quality.
Unfortunately, existing quality enhancement approaches for compressed images
neglect the inherent characteristic of defocus, resulting in inferior
performance. This paper finds that in compressed images, significantly
defocused regions have better compression quality, and two regions with
different defocus values possess diverse texture patterns. These observations
motivate our defocus-aware quality enhancement (DAQE) approach. Specifically,
we propose a novel dynamic region-based deep learning architecture of the DAQE
approach, which considers the regionwise defocus difference of compressed
images in two aspects. (1) The DAQE approach employs fewer computational
resources to enhance the quality of significantly defocused regions and more
resources to enhance the quality of other regions; (2) The DAQE approach learns
to separately enhance diverse texture patterns for regions with different
defocus values, such that texture-specific enhancement can be achieved.
Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our DAQE approach over
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality enhancement and resource
savings.

it as a text-to-text generation problem, i.e., generating a sarcastic sentence

sarcasm generation (CMSG), i.e., generating a sarcastic description for a given

sarcasm, as well as the correlation between different modalities. In addition,
there should be some inconsistency between the two modalities, which requires
imagination. Moreover, high-quality training data is insufficient. To address
these problems, we take a step toward generating sarcastic descriptions from
images without paired training data and propose an
Extraction-Generation-Ranking based Modular method (EGRM) for cross-model
sarcasm generation. Specifically, EGRM first extracts diverse information from
an image at different levels and uses the obtained image tags, sentimental
descriptive caption, and commonsense-based consequence to generate candidate
sarcastic texts. Then, a comprehensive ranking algorithm, which considers
image-text relation, sarcasticness, and grammaticality, is proposed to select a
final text from the candidate texts. Human evaluation at five criteria on a

from two severe problems: (i) Neglecting the ambiguity of synonyms, and (ii)
Undermining semantic understanding of original PLMs, which is caused by
inconsistency between the exact semantic similarity of the synonyms and the
broad conceptual relevance learned from the original corpus. To address these
issues, we propose PICSO, a flexible framework that supports the injection of
contextual synonym knowledge from multiple domains into PLMs via a novel
entity-aware Adapter which focuses on the semantics of the entities (synonyms)

semantic understanding of the original PLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that PICSO can dramatically outperform the original PLMs and the other

distributions $\nu$ with finite second moment, coupling proofs reveal that an
$\varepsilon$-accurate approximation of the target distribution $\mu$ in
$L^2$-Wasserstein distance $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}^2$ can be achieved by the
uHMC algorithm with sMC time integration using $O\left((d/K)^{1/3} (L/K)^{5/3}
\varepsilon^{-2/3} \log( \boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}^2(\mu, \nu) /

randomization, which has a similar effect as partial momentum refreshment, is
also treated. In this case, without additional assumptions on the target

the availability of large-scale real-world data. However, processing such
massive amounts of data comes at a considerable cost in terms of computations,
storage, training and the search for good neural architectures. Dataset
distillation has thus recently come to the fore. This paradigm involves
distilling information from large real-world datasets into tiny and compact
synthetic datasets such that processing the latter ideally yields similar
performances as the former. State-of-the-art methods primarily rely on learning
the synthetic dataset by matching the gradients obtained during training
between the real and synthetic data. However, these gradient-matching methods
suffer from the so-called accumulated trajectory error caused by the
discrepancy between the distillation and subsequent evaluation. To mitigate the
adverse impact of this accumulated trajectory error, we propose a novel
approach that encourages the optimization algorithm to seek a flat trajectory.
We show that the weights trained on synthetic data are robust against the
accumulated errors perturbations with the regularization towards the flat
trajectory. Our method, called Flat Trajectory Distillation (FTD), is shown to
boost the performance of gradient-matching methods by up to 4.7% on a subset of
images of the ImageNet dataset with higher resolution images. We also validate
the effectiveness and generalizability of our method with datasets of different
resolutions and demonstrate its applicability to neural architecture search.

perfect precision at >50% recall. Together these results show that modern deep
learning models can approach expert-level performance for chromosome aberration
detection. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the
downstream effectiveness of TopViTs. These results open up exciting
opportunities for not only expediting patient results but providing a scalable
technology for early screening of low-abundance chromosomal lesions.

secure, fungible, decentralized, directly controlled, privacy-preserving; but
enhanced with qualitatively new functionality. It is extremely efficiently
transferable and, most importantly, transactional or, more generally,
contract-backed. This facilitates fully automated, guaranteed transactional
execution of atomic resource exchanges and more complex contracts, without a
multitude of intermediaries and expensive or slow semi-manual processes.
  A didactic objective is separating money characteristics from technology
aspects such as specific blockchain and distributed ledger systems to help
disentangle discussions of digital money design from implementation techniques.
  We finally discuss the power and role of programmable (contract-backed)
digital money in case studies: tokenization of invoice debt using smart
contracts on Ethereum, with stablecoins serving as digital money; smart
contracts for disbursing payments transparently and reliably in accordance with
social legislation; and a Danish e-krone for crowdfunding public and private
community projets.
  These contributions are made in independent chapters by participants of the
Working Group on Digital Cash at Copenhagen FinTech in 2018 and 2019, which
have not been published before.
  Collectively, the contributions illustrate the design space and potential of
digital money when powered by smart digital contracts that effectively
eliminate both counterparty risk (somebody does not pay or does not deliver)
and settlement risk (a trade fails and needs to be aborted) orders of magnitude
faster than in current financial practice.

SLR creation. The present review identifies the objectives of the automation
studies and the aspects of those steps that were automated. In so doing, the
various ML techniques used, challenges, limitations and scope of further
research are explained.
  Methods: Accessible published literature studies that primarily focus on
automation of study selection, study quality assessment, data extraction and
data synthesis portions of SLR. Twenty-nine studies were analyzed.
  Results: This review identifies the objectives of the automation studies,
steps within the study selection, study quality assessment, data extraction and
data synthesis portions that were automated, the various ML techniques used,
challenges, limitations and scope of further research.
  Discussion: We describe uses of NLP/TM techniques to support increased
automation of systematic literature reviews. This area has attracted increase
attention in the last decade due to significant gaps in the applicability of TM
to automate steps in the SLR process. There are significant gaps in the
application of TM and related automation techniques in the areas of data
extraction, monitoring, quality assessment and data synthesis. There is thus a
need for continued progress in this area, and this is expected to ultimately
significantly facilitate the construction of systematic literature reviews.

masked language modeling (CMLM) to learn vision-language associations. However,
we find that CMLM is insufficient for this purpose according to our
observations: (1) Modality bias: a considerable amount of masked tokens in CMLM
can be recovered with only the language information, ignoring the visual
inputs. (2) Under-utilization of the unmasked tokens: CMLM primarily focuses on
the masked token but it cannot simultaneously leverage other tokens to learn
vision-language associations. To handle those limitations, we propose EPIC
(lEveraging Per Image-Token Consistency for vision-language pre-training). In
EPIC, for each image-sentence pair, we mask tokens that are salient to the
image (i.e., Saliency-based Masking Strategy) and replace them with
alternatives sampled from a language model (i.e., Inconsistent Token Generation
Procedure), and then the model is required to determine for each token in the
sentence whether they are consistent with the image (i.e., Image-Text
Consistent Task). The proposed EPIC method is easily combined with pre-training
methods. Extensive experiments show that the combination of the EPIC method and
state-of-the-art pre-training approaches, including ViLT, ALBEF, METER, and
X-VLM, leads to significant improvements on downstream tasks.

on more comprehensive emotional clues and multimodal emotion dataset. In this
paper, we developed a large multimodal emotion dataset, named ""HED"" dataset, to
facilitate the emotion recognition task, and accordingly propose a multimodal
emotion recognition method. To promote recognition accuracy, ""Feature After
Feature"" framework was used to explore crucial emotional information from the
aligned face, body and text samples. We employ various benchmarks to evaluate
the ""HED"" dataset and compare the performance with our method. The results show
that the five classification accuracy of the proposed multimodal fusion method
is about 83.75%, and the performance is improved by 1.83%, 9.38%, and 21.62%
respectively compared with that of individual modalities. The complementarity
between each channel is effectively used to improve the performance of emotion
recognition. We had also established a multimodal online emotion prediction
platform, aiming to provide free emotion prediction to more users.

motivated by their enabling power. The accumulation of new data, sustained by
progress in technology, leads to a boundless expansion of stored data, in some
cases with an exponential increase in the accrual rate itself. Massive data are
hard to process, transmit, store, and exploit, and it is particularly hard to
keep abreast of the data store as a whole. This paper distinguishes three
phases in the life of data: acquisition, curation, and exploitation. Each
involves a distinct process, that may be separated from the others in time,
with a different set of priorities. The function of the second phase, curation,
is to maximize the future value of the data given limited storage. I argue that
this requires that (a) the data take the form of summary statistics and (b)
these statistics follow an endless process of rescaling. The summary may be
more compact than the original data, but its data structure is more complex and
it requires an on-going computational process that is much more sophisticated
than mere storage. Rescaling results in dimensionality reduction that may be
beneficial for learning, but that must be carefully controlled to preserve
relevance. Rescaling may be tuned based on feedback from usage, with the
proviso that our memory of the past serves the future, the needs of which are
not fully known.

  Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science",,"10.1063/5.0128743",,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The role of topological heterogeneity in the origin of extreme events in a
network is investigated here. The dynamics of the oscillators associated with
the nodes are assumed to be identical and influenced by mean-field repulsive
interactions. An interplay of topological heterogeneity and the repulsive
interaction between the dynamical units of the network triggers extreme events
in the nodes when each node succumbs to such events for discretely different
ranges of repulsive coupling. A high degree node is vulnerable to weaker
repulsive interactions, while a low degree node is susceptible to stronger
interactions. As a result, the formation of extreme events changes position
with increasing strength of repulsive interaction from high to low degree
nodes. Extreme events at any node are identified with the appearance of
occasional large-amplitude events (amplitude of the temporal dynamics) that are
larger than a threshold height and rare in occurrence, which we confirm by
estimating the probability distribution of all events. Extreme events appear at
any oscillator near the boundary of transition from rotation to libration at a
critical value of the repulsive coupling strength. To explore the phenomenon, a
paradigmatic second-order phase model is used to represent the dynamics of the
oscillator associated with each node. We make an annealed network approximation
to reduce our original model and thereby confirm the dual role of the repulsive
interaction and the degree of a node in the origin of extreme events in any
oscillator.

  lunar exploration",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The European Space Agency (ESA) has a clear mission to go forward to the Moon
in preparation of human presence on Mars. One of the technologies looked at to
increase safety and efficiency of astronauts in this context is Augmented
Reality (AR). This technology allows digital visual information to be overlaid
onto the user's environment through some type of display or projector. In
recent years separate studies have been conducted to test the potential value
of AR for astronauts by implementing a few functionalities on an AR display
followed by testing in terrestrial analogue environments. One of the groups
contributing to these investigations is Spaceship EAC (SSEAC). SSEAC is a group
of interns and trainees at the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) focusing on
emerging technologies for human space exploration. This paper presents an
outcome of SSEAC's activities related to AR for lunar extravehicular activities
(EVAs), in which an approach similar to design thinking was used to explore,
identify, and structure the opportunities offered by this technology. The
resulting categorization of AR use cases can be used to identify new
functionalities to test through prototyping and usability tests and can also be
used to relate individual studies to each other to gain insight into the
overall potential value AR has to offer to human lunar exploration. The
approach adopted in this paper is based on the Fuzzy Front End (FFE) model from
the innovation management domain. Utilising a user-driven instead of
technology-driven method resulted in findings that are relevant irrespective of
the hardware and software implementation. Instead, the outcome is an overview
of use cases in which some type of AR system could provide value by
contributing to increased astronaut safety, efficiency and/or efficacy.
