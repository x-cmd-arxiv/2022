econometric fields as to whether nonparametric estimation that uses
data-adaptive methods, like machine learning algorithms in model fitting,
confer any meaningful advantage over simpler, parametric approaches in
real-world, finite sample estimation of causal effects. We address the
question: when trying to estimate the effect of a treatment on an outcome,
across a universe of reasonable data distributions, how much does the choice of
nonparametric vs.~parametric estimation matter? Instead of answering this
question with simulations that reflect a few chosen data scenarios, we propose
a novel approach evaluating performance across thousands of data-generating
mechanisms drawn from non-parametric models with semi-informative priors. We
call this approach a Universal Monte-Carlo Simulation. We compare performance
of estimating the average treatment effect across two parametric estimators (a
g-computation estimator that uses a parametric outcome model and an inverse
probability of treatment weighted estimator) and two nonparametric estimators
(Bayesian additive regression trees and a targeted minimum loss-based estimator
that uses an ensemble of machine learning algorithms in model fitting). We
summarize estimator performance in terms of bias, confidence interval coverage,
and mean squared error. We find that the nonparametric estimators nearly always
outperform the parametric estimators with the exception of having similar
performance in terms of bias and similar-to-slightly-worse performance in terms
of coverage under the smallest sample size of N=100.

increase the effective bit-depth of SLMs which utilizes a linear slope as is
commonly applied to deal with the zeroth order effect. This technique was
tested using two interferometric transient absorption spectroscopy setups.
Through the high harmonic generation in gases producing a train of attosecond

that interfere in the far field providing a measurement of the optical phase.
An increase in the precision far beyond the limit dictated by the digital

data generating mechanism (DGM). Results from different studies on a complex
DGM, derived from different data sets, and using complicated models and
algorithms, are hard to quantitatively compare due to random noise and
statistical uncertainty in model results. This has been one of the main
contributors to the replication crisis in the behavioral sciences.
  The contribution of this paper is to apply prediction scoring to the problem
of comparing two studies, such as can arise when evaluating replications or
competing evidence.
  We examine the role of predictive models in quantitatively assessing
agreement between two datasets that are assumed to come from two distinct DGMs.
We formalize a distance between the DGMs that is estimated using cross
validation. We argue that the resulting prediction scores depend on the
predictive models created by cross validation. In this sense, the prediction
scores measure the distance between DGMs, along the dimension of the particular
predictive model. Using human behavior data from experimental economics, we
demonstrate that prediction scores can be used to evaluate preregistered
hypotheses and provide insights comparing data from different populations and
settings. We examine the asymptotic behavior of the prediction scores using
simulated experimental data and demonstrate that leveraging competing
predictive models can reveal important differences between underlying DGMs. Our
proposed cross-validated prediction scores are capable of quantifying
differences between unobserved data generating mechanisms and allow for the
validation and assessment of results from complex models.

In contrast, only ordinal preferences are elicited in fields such as matching
under preferences. The literature focuses on mechanisms with simple dominant
strategies. However, many real-world applications do not have dominant
strategies, so intensities between preferences matter when participants
determine their strategies. Even though precise information about cardinal
utilities is unavailable, some data about the likelihood of utility functions
is typically accessible. We propose to use Bayesian games to formalize
uncertainty about decision-makers utilities by viewing them as a collection of
normal-form games where uncertainty about types persist in all game stages.
Instead of searching for the Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we consider the question
of how uncertainty in utilities is reflected in uncertainty of strategic play.
We introduce $\alpha$-Rank-collections as a solution concept that extends
$\alpha$-Rank, a new solution concept for normal-form games, to Bayesian games.
This allows us to analyze the strategic play in, for example,
(non-strategyproof) matching markets, for which we do not have appropriate
solution concepts so far. $\alpha$-Rank-collections characterize a range of
strategy-profiles emerging from replicator dynamics of the game rather than
equilibrium point. We prove that $\alpha$-Rank-collections are invariant to
positive affine transformations, and that they are efficient to approximate. An
instance of the Boston mechanism is used to illustrate the new solution
concept.

nonclassicality of large masses is a quest currently attracting considerable
research. Motivated by this, we investigate the quantum violation of the
pivotal classical notion of macrorealism (MR) for arbitrary masses in a
harmonic potential. To this end, we use two standard tools for probing the
violation of MR, namely the two-time Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) and the
no-signalling in time (NSIT) condition, but crucially, modify them to the case
of two different measurement arrangements at successive times. This yields a
striking result: a {\em mass-independent} violation of MR is possible, thereby
providing a mass-independent demonstration of an irreducible quantumness of
macroscopic objects. In fact, our adaptation of LGI and NSIT enables probing
quantum violations for literally any mass, momentum, energy and frequency. Our
proposed test of MR can in principle be realised with a large range of harmonic
oscillator systems from atomic ions to mirrors in LIGO, while the uncertainties
in the measurements for large masses can be offset by decreasing the angular
frequency, suggesting that for such systems MR test can be performed based on
existing experimental technology.

solving linear feasibility problems and has recently gained popularity due to
its speed and low memory requirement. This paper develops an accelerated
variant of the standard RP method by using two ingredients: the greedy
probability criterion and the average block approach, and obtains a greedy
randomized average block projection (GRABP) method for solving large-scale
systems of linear inequalities. We prove that this method converges linearly in
expectation under different choices of extrapolated stepsizes. Numerical
experiments on both randomly generated and real-world data show the advantage
of GRABP over several state-of-the-art solvers, such as the randomized
projection (RP) method, the sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (SKM) method, the
generalized SKM (GSKM) method, and the Nesterov acceleration of SKM method.

the notion of \emph{differential privacy} (DP) has been proposed, which

Standard algorithms for differentially private estimation are based on adding
an appropriate amount of noise to the output of a traditional point estimation
method. This leads to an accuracy-privacy trade off, as adding more noise
reduces the accuracy while increasing privacy. In this paper, we propose a new

simulate shear motion on pre-existing faults at various velocities and

We find that these tethers are fairly robust across a range of temperature and

using a novel combination of a low-threshold X-ray detector surrounded by a

biosensor is challenging and requires a miniaturized plasmonic structure, e.g.,
a vertical Au nanorod (AuNR) array based metamaterials. The sensitivity of a
sensor mainly depends on transducer properties and hence for instance, the AuNR
array geometry requires optimization. Physical vapour deposition methods (e.g.,
sputtering and e-beam evaporation) require a vacuum environment to deposit Au,
which is costly, time-consuming, and thickness-limited. On the other hand,
chemical deposition, i.e., electroplating deposit higher thickness in less time
and at lower cost, becomes an alternative method for Au deposition. In this
work, we present a detailed optimization for electroplating based fabrication
of these metamaterials. We find that slightly acidic (6.0 < pH < 7.0) gold
sulfite solution supports immersion deposition, which should be minimized to
avoid uncontrolled Au deposition. Immersion deposition leads to plate-like (for
smaller radius AuNR) or capped-like, i.e., mushroom (for higher radius AuNR)

reliance on it can lead to incorrect predictions when spurious correlations
between foreground and background are broken at test time. Training on a
dataset where these correlations are unbiased would lead to more robust models.
In this paper, we propose such a dataset called Diffusion Dreamed Distribution
Shifts (D3S). D3S consists of synthetic images generated through
StableDiffusion using text prompts and image guides obtained by pasting a
sample foreground image onto a background template image. Using this scalable
approach we generate 120K images of objects from all 1000 ImageNet classes in
10 diverse backgrounds. Due to the incredible photorealism of the diffusion
model, our images are much closer to natural images than previous synthetic
datasets. D3S contains a validation set of more than 17K images whose labels
are human-verified in an MTurk study. Using the validation set, we evaluate
several popular DNN image classifiers and find that the classification
performance of models generally suffers on our background diverse images. Next,
we leverage the foreground & background labels in D3S to learn a foreground
(background) representation that is invariant to changes in background
(foreground) by penalizing the mutual information between the foreground
(background) features and the background (foreground) labels. Linear
classifiers trained on these features to predict foreground (background) from
foreground (background) have high accuracies at 82.9% (93.8%), while
classifiers that predict these labels from background and foreground have a
much lower accuracy of 2.4% and 45.6% respectively. This suggests that our
foreground and background features are well disentangled. We further test the
efficacy of these representations by training classifiers on a task with strong
spurious correlations.

atmospheric science community with a wide range of applications. To enable
users to understand what an ML model has learned, ML explainability has become
a field of active research. In Part I of this two-part study, we described
several explainability methods and demonstrated that feature rankings from
different methods can substantially disagree with each other. It is unclear,
though, whether the disagreement is overinflated due to some methods being less
faithful in assigning importance. Herein, ""faithfulness"" or ""fidelity"" refer to
the correspondence between the assigned feature importance and the contribution
of the feature to model performance. In the present study, we evaluate the
faithfulness of feature ranking methods using multiple methods. Given the
sensitivity of explanation methods to feature correlations, we also quantify
how much explainability faithfulness improves after correlated features are
limited. Before dimensionality reduction, the feature relevance methods [e.g.,
SHAP, LIME, ALE variance, and logistic regression (LR) coefficients] were
generally more faithful than the permutation importance methods due to the
negative impact of correlated features. Once correlated features were reduced,
traditional permutation importance became the most faithful method. In
addition, the ranking uncertainty (i.e., the spread in rank assigned to a
feature by the different ranking methods) was reduced by a factor of 2-10, and
excluding less faithful feature ranking methods reduces it further. This study
is one of the first to quantify the improvement in explainability from limiting
correlated features and knowing the relative fidelity of different
explainability methods.

impacts of climate change. However, it is challenging to place sensors in a way
that maximises the informativeness of their measurements, particularly in
remote regions like Antarctica. Probabilistic machine learning models can
suggest informative sensor placements by finding sites that maximally reduce
prediction uncertainty. Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used for this
purpose, but they struggle with capturing complex non-stationary behaviour and
scaling to large datasets. This paper proposes using a convolutional Gaussian
neural process (ConvGNP) to address these issues. A ConvGNP uses neural
networks to parameterise a joint Gaussian distribution at arbitrary target
locations, enabling flexibility and scalability. Using simulated surface air
temperature anomaly over Antarctica as training data, the ConvGNP learns
spatial and seasonal non-stationarities, outperforming a non-stationary GP
baseline. In a simulated sensor placement experiment, the ConvGNP better
predicts the performance boost obtained from new observations than GP
baselines, leading to more informative sensor placements. We contrast our
approach with physics-based sensor placement methods and propose future steps
towards an operational sensor placement recommendation system. Our work could
help to realise environmental digital twins that actively direct measurement
sampling to improve the digital representation of reality.

extracted from fully sampled projection data is trained and then used to
inpaint down-sampled projection data. The network does not require paired

reimplemented as a true spectral transform method. As part of this
reformulation, the precise sense in which the spectral transforms diagonalize
the underlying spatial differential operator was elucidated. That work
concentrated on two point initial boundary value problems and interface
problems on networks of finite intervals. In the present work, we extend these
results, by means of three examples, to new classes of problems: problems on
semiinfinite domains, problems with nonlocal boundary conditions, and problems
in which the partial differential equation features mixed derivatives. We show
that the transform pair derived via the Fokas transform method features the
same Fokas diagonalization property in each of these new settings, and we argue
that this weak diagonalization property is precisely that needed to ensure
success of a spectral transform method.

Coupled-cluster theory and the full configuration interaction procedure were
used to perform required electronic structure calculations. The mean absolute
relative uncertainty of the trace of the three-body polarizability tensor,
resulting from the incompleteness of orbital basis set, was determined using
extrapolation techniques. Additional uncertainty due to approximate treatment
of triple and the neglect of higher excitations was estimated using full
configuration interaction calculations. An analytic function was developed to
describe the behavior of the polarizability and its asymptotic decay to
three-atomic and atom-diatom fragmentation channels. We also developed an
analytic function describing the local behavior of the total uncertainty of our
calculations. Using both fits we calculated the third dielectric virial
coefficient and its uncertainty using the classical and semiclassical
Feynman-Hibbs approaches. The results of our calculations were compared with
available experimental data and with recent Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC)
calculations employing the so-called superposition approximation of the
three-body polarizability. For temperatures above 200 K we observed significant
discrepancy between the classical results obtained using either the
superposition approximation or the ab initio computed polarizability. The
theoretical data reported in this work eliminate the main accuracy bottleneck
of the development of optical pressure standard and are expected to facilitate
further progress in the field of quantum thermal metrology

time coordinate which represents the local proper time for a charged massive
particle released from rest at spatial infinity. The chosen coordinates ensure
that the solution is well-behaved at horizons and enable an intuitive
description of many physical phenomena. If the charge of the particle $e = 0$,
the coordinates reduce to Doran coordinates for the Kerr solution with the
replacement $M \to M - Q^2/(2r)$, where $M$ and $Q$ are the mass and charge of
the black hole, respectively. Such coordinates are valid only for $r \ge
Q^2/(2M)$, however, which corresponds to the region that a neutral particle
released from rest at infinity can penetrate. By contrast, for $e \neq 0$ and
of opposite sign to $Q$, the new coordinates have a progressively extended
range of validity as $|e|$ increases and tend to advanced Eddington-Finkelstein
(EF) null coordinates as $|e| \to \infty$, hence becoming global in this limit.
The Kerr solution (i.e.\ with $Q=0$) may also be written in terms of the new
coordinates by setting $eQ = -\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a real parameter
unrelated to charge; in this case the coordinate system is global for all
non-negative values of $\alpha$ and the limits $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha \to
\infty$ correspond to Doran coordinates and advanced EF null coordinates,
respectively, without any need to transform between them.

These models are usually white-box, as they are obtained based on full

cosmology of complex quintessence by revamping the potential and investigating
the scalar field dynamics. Then we analyze ($\omega-\omega'$) and stability in
two cases, i.e., non-interacting and interacting. We will explore whether these
cases describe a real universe by calculating fractional energy density
$\Omega_{D}$ and concerning two parts of the quintessence field effect (
complex and real part ) by considering the real part of this field to be a
slow-roll field. We know that the part in which the fractional energy density
($\Omega_{D} > 1$) does not describe a real universe. Also, we specified an
interacting coupling parameter $b^{2}$ that depends on the constant parameter
of the Tsallis holographic model ($\delta$) with respect to fractional energy
density ($0.73$). Unlike independence between the fractional energy density and
interacting coupling in the real quintessence model, we determine a
relationship among these parameters in this theory. Finally, by plotting some

build on the recent crossview completion framework, a variation of masked image

suited for binocular downstream tasks. The applicability of this concept has so
far been limited in at least two ways: (a) by the difficulty of collecting
realworld image pairs -- in practice only synthetic data have been used -- and
(b) by the lack of generalization of vanilla transformers to dense downstream
tasks for which relative position is more meaningful than absolute position. We
explore three avenues of improvement: first, we introduce a method to collect
suitable real-world image pairs at large scale. Second, we experiment with
relative positional embeddings and show that they enable vision transformers to
perform substantially better. Third, we scale up vision transformer based
cross-completion architectures, which is made possible by the use of large

inefficiently handled by modern processors and memory systems highly optimized
for regular, contiguous data. Recent work tackles these inefficiencies in
hardware through core-side stream extensions or memory-side prefetchers and
accelerators, but fails to provide end-to-end solutions which also achieve high
efficiency in on-chip interconnects. We propose AXI-Pack, an extension to ARM's
AXI4 protocol introducing bandwidth-efficient strided and indirect bursts to
enable end-to-end irregular streams. AXI-Pack adds irregular stream semantics
to memory requests and avoids inefficient narrow-bus transfers by packing
multiple narrow data elements onto a wide bus. It retains full compatibility
with AXI4 and does not require modifications to non-burst-reshaping
interconnect IPs. To demonstrate our approach end-to-end, we extend an
open-source RISC-V vector processor to leverage AXI-Pack at its memory
interface for strided and indexed accesses. On the memory side, we design a
banked memory controller efficiently handling AXI-Pack requests. On a system
with a 256-bit-wide interconnect running FP32 workloads, AXI-Pack achieves
near-ideal peak on-chip bus utilizations of 87% and 39%, speedups of 5.4x and
2.4x, and energy efficiency improvements of 5.3x and 2.1x over a baseline using
an AXI4 bus on strided and indirect benchmarks, respectively.

state in the continuum. We find that such lasers enable orders of magnitude
reduction of the quantum-limited linewidth, and by introducing mirror symmetry
breaking, the linewidth can be further reduced. In contrast to ordinary
macroscopic lasers, though, the linewidth may re-broaden due to optical
nonlinearities enhanced by the strong light localization. This leads to the
identification of optimal material systems. We also show that the coherence of
this new type of microscopic laser can be understood intuitively using a
simple, effective potential model. Based on this model, we examine the laser
stability and deduce the dependence of the laser linewidth on the general Fano
lineshape. Our model facilitates the incorporation of other degrees of design

predicted lexical ``keys'' such that a query token vector only interacts with
document token vectors routed to the same key. This design significantly
reduces the computation cost while maintaining high accuracy. Notably, CITADEL

In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language models (PAL): a novel approach
that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as
the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime

spinor quantum gas can lead to scaling of the optimal measurement precision
beyond the Heisenberg scaling. We show that quadratic scaling with the number
of atoms can be facilitated via squeezed center-of-mass excitations of the
atomic motion using a 1D spin-orbit coupled fermions or strongly interacting
bosons (Tonks-Girardeau gas). Based on predictions derived from analytic
calculations of the corresponding quantum Fisher information, we then introduce
a protocol which overcomes the Heisenberg scaling (and limit) with help of a
tailored excited and entangled many-body state of a non-interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate. We identify corresponding optimal measurements and
argue that even finite temperature as a source of decoherence is, in principle,
rather favorable for the obtainable precision scaling.

  Completion",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diverse image completion, a problem of generating various ways of filling
incomplete regions (i.e. holes) of an image, has made remarkable success.
However, managing input images with large holes is still a challenging problem
due to the corruption of semantically important structures. In this paper, we
tackle this problem by incorporating explicit structural guidance. We propose a
structure-guided diffusion model (SGDM) for the large-hole diverse completion
problem. Our proposed SGDM consists of a structure generator and a texture
generator, which are both diffusion probabilistic models (DMs). The structure
generator generates an edge image representing a plausible structure within the
holes, which is later used to guide the texture generation process. To jointly
train these two generators, we design a strategy that combines optimal Bayesian
denoising and a momentum framework. In addition to the quality improvement,
auxiliary edge images generated by the structure generator can be manually
edited to allow user-guided image editing. Our experiments using datasets of
faces (CelebA-HQ) and natural scenes (Places) show that our method achieves a
comparable or superior trade-off between visual quality and diversity compared
to other state-of-the-art methods.

weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that
weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the
activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from
activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation.
SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for
all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, and
LLaMA family. We demonstrate up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for
LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM

of Reionization (EoR) is made difficult by bright foreground emission which is
2-5 orders of magnitude larger than the expected signal. Fitting for a
physics-motivated parametric forward model of the data within a Bayesian
framework provides a robust means to separate the signal from the foregrounds,
given sufficient information about the instrument and sky. It has previously
been demonstrated that, within such a modelling framework, a foreground model
of sufficient fidelity can be generated by dividing the sky into $N$ regions
and scaling a base map assuming a distinct uniform spectral index in each
region. Using the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH)
as our fiducial instrument, we show that, if unaccounted-for, amplitude errors
in low-frequency radio maps used for our base map model will prevent recovery
of the 21-cm signal within this framework, and that the level of bias in the
recovered 21-cm signal is proportional to the amplitude and the correlation
length of the base-map errors in the region. We introduce an updated foreground
model that is capable of accounting for these measurement errors by fitting for
a monopole offset and a set of spatially-dependent scale factors describing the
ratio of the true and model sky temperatures, with the size of the set
determined by Bayesian evidence-based model comparison. We show that our model
is flexible enough to account for multiple foreground error scenarios allowing
the 21-cm sky-averaged signal to be detected without bias from simulated

We explore which of these dependencies are intrinsic and which are an indirect

regression. We find that for local star-forming galaxies, high-z galaxies, and
AGN host galaxies, the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation (SK, between $M_{H_2}$ and

i.e. the Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS), is an indirect by-product of the
former two. Hence the Star-Forming Main Sequence is not a fundamental scaling
relation for local or high-redshift galaxies. We find evidence for both the
evolution of the MGMS and SK relation over cosmic time, where, at a given
stellar mass, the higher the redshift, the greater the molecular gas mass and
the star formation efficiency. We offer a parameterisation of both the MGMS and
SK relation's evolution with redshift, showing how they combine to form the
observed evolution of the SFMS. In addition, we find that the local AGN host

subsequently experience a ""rejuvenation"" event to become star-forming once
more. Rejuvenation rates vary substantially in models of galaxy formation:
10%-70% of massive galaxies are expected to experience rejuvenation by z = 0.
Measuring the rate of rejuvenation is therefore important for calibrating the
strength of star formation feedback mechanisms. However, these observations are
challenging because rejuvenating systems blend in with normal star-forming
galaxies in broadband photometry. In this paper, we use the galaxy spectral
energy distribution (SED)-fitting code Prospector to search for observational
markers that distinguish normal star-forming galaxies from rejuvenating
galaxies. We find that rejuvenating galaxies have smaller Balmer absorption
line equivalent widths (EWs) than star-forming galaxies. This is analogous to
the well-known ""K + A"" or post-starburst galaxies, which have strong Balmer
absorption due to A-stars dominating the light: in this case, rejuvenating
systems have a lack of A-stars, instead resembling ""O - A"" systems. We find
star-forming galaxies that have H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and/or H$\delta$
absorption EWs $\lesssim 3${\AA} corresponds to a highly pure selection of
rejuvenating systems. Interestingly, while this technique is highly effective
at identifying mild rejuvenation, ""strongly"" rejuvenating systems remain nearly
indistinguishable from star-forming galaxies due to the well-known stellar
outshining effect. We conclude that measuring Balmer absorption line EWs in
star-forming galaxy populations is an efficient method to identify rejuvenating
populations, and discuss several techniques to either remove or resolve the
nebular emission which typically lies on top of these absorption lines.

ergodicity for the spin motion, and use it to identify when classical chaos is
both strong and global in phase space. In the quantum domain, our analysis of
the Hamiltonian matrix in a proper representation allows us to obtain the
conditions for the onset of quantum chaos as a function of the model
parameters. From the comparison between the quantum and classical domains, we
demonstrate that quantum quantities, such as the local density of states (LDOS)

finding is the relationship between the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and the width

methods, privacy risks cannot be entirely eliminated. The residual privacy
risks need instead to be ex-post assessed. We present Anonymeter, a statistical
framework to jointly quantify different types of privacy risks in synthetic
tabular datasets. We equip this framework with attack-based evaluations for the
singling out, linkability, and inference risks, the three key indicators of
factual anonymization according to the European General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce
a coherent and legally aligned evaluation of these three privacy risks for
synthetic data, and to design privacy attacks which model directly the singling
out and linkability risks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by
conducting an extensive set of experiments that measure the privacy risks of
data with deliberately inserted privacy leakages, and of synthetic data
generated with and without differential privacy. Our results highlight that the
three privacy risks reported by our framework scale linearly with the amount of
privacy leakage in the data. Furthermore, we observe that synthetic data
exhibits the lowest vulnerability against linkability, indicating one-to-one
relationships between real and synthetic data records are not preserved.
Finally, we demonstrate quantitatively that Anonymeter outperforms existing
synthetic data privacy evaluation frameworks both in terms of detecting privacy
leaks, as well as computation speed. To contribute to a privacy-conscious usage

refinement tasks such as graph completion and triple classification. These
techniques aim at embedding the entities and relations of a Knowledge Graph
(KG) in a low dimensional continuous feature space. This paper adopts a
transformer-based triplet network creating an embedding space that clusters the
information about an entity or relation in the KG. It creates textual sequences
from facts and fine-tunes a triplet network of pre-trained transformer-based
language models. It adheres to an evaluation paradigm that relies on an
efficient spatial semantic search technique. We show that this evaluation
protocol is more adapted to a few-shot setting for the relation prediction
task. Our proposed GilBERT method is evaluated on triplet classification and
relation prediction tasks on multiple well-known benchmark knowledge graphs
such as FB13, WN11, and FB15K. We show that GilBERT achieves better or
comparable results to the state-of-the-art performance on these two refinement
tasks.

communication system provides control over the propagation environment, which

these performance gains are highly dependent on the applied phase shifts at the
RIS, accurate channel state information at the transceivers is imperative.
However, not only do RISs traditionally lack signal processing capabilities,
but their end-to-end channels also consist of multiple components. Hence,
conventional channel estimation (CE) algorithms become incompatible with
RIS-aided communication systems as they fail to provide the necessary
information about the channel components, which are essential for a beneficial
RIS configuration. To enable the full potential of RISs, we propose to use
tensor-decomposition-based CE, which facilitates smart configuration of the RIS
by providing the required channel components. We use canonical polyadic (CP)
decomposition, that exploits a structured time domain pilot sequence. Compared
to other state-of-the-art decomposition methods, the proposed Semi-Algebraic CP
decomposition via Simultaneous Matrix Diagonalization (SECSI) algorithm is more
time efficient as it does not require an iterative process. The benefits of
SECSI for RIS-aided networks are validated with numerical results, which show
the improved individual and end-to-end CE accuracy of SECSI.

attention weights for each layer, and loss reweighting to focus on the learning
of items belonging to long-tail categories. Blending the three modules into
GNN, we present DGRec(Diversified GNN-based Recommender System) for diversified
recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method can achieve the best diversity while keeping the accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art GNN-based recommender systems.

vapor, aerosols, and alkali metals in a few dozen exoplanet atmospheres.
However, these previous inferences with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes
were hindered by the observations' relatively narrow wavelength range and
spectral resolving power, which precluded the unambiguous identification of
other chemical species$-$in particular the primary carbon-bearing molecules.
Here we report a broad-wavelength 0.5-5.5 $\mu$m atmospheric transmission
spectrum of WASP-39 b, a 1200 K, roughly Saturn-mass, Jupiter-radius exoplanet,
measured with JWST NIRSpec's PRISM mode as part of the JWST Transiting
Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Team program. We robustly detect
multiple chemical species at high significance, including Na (19$\sigma$),
H$_2$O (33$\sigma$), CO$_2$ (28$\sigma$), and CO (7$\sigma$). The non-detection
of CH$_4$, combined with a strong CO$_2$ feature, favours atmospheric models
with a super-solar atmospheric metallicity. An unanticipated absorption feature
at 4$\mu$m is best explained by SO$_2$ (2.7$\sigma$), which could be a tracer
of atmospheric photochemistry. These observations demonstrate JWST's
sensitivity to a rich diversity of exoplanet compositions and chemical
processes.

atmospheres is a fundamental step towards constraining the dominant chemical
processes at work and, if in equilibrium, revealing planet formation histories.
Transmission spectroscopy provides the necessary means by constraining the
abundances of oxygen- and carbon-bearing species; however, this requires broad
wavelength coverage, moderate spectral resolution, and high precision that,
together, are not achievable with previous observatories. Now that JWST has
commenced science operations, we are able to observe exoplanets at previously
uncharted wavelengths and spectral resolutions. Here we report time-series
observations of the transiting exoplanet WASP-39b using JWST's Near InfraRed
Camera (NIRCam). The long-wavelength spectroscopic and short-wavelength
photometric light curves span 2.0 - 4.0 $\mu$m, exhibit minimal systematics,
and reveal well-defined molecular absorption features in the planet's spectrum.
Specifically, we detect gaseous H$_2$O in the atmosphere and place an upper
limit on the abundance of CH$_4$. The otherwise prominent CO$_2$ feature at 2.8
$\mu$m is largely masked by H$_2$O. The best-fit chemical equilibrium models
favour an atmospheric metallicity of 1-100$\times$ solar (i.e., an enrichment
of elements heavier than helium relative to the Sun) and a sub-stellar
carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. The inferred high metallicity and low C/O ratio
may indicate significant accretion of solid materials during planet formation
or disequilibrium processes in the upper atmosphere.

regulates the atmospheric composition and stability. However, no unambiguous
photochemical products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres to date.
Recent observations from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Early Release Science
Program found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 $\mu$m arising from SO$_2$
in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass
(0.28 M$_J$) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium
temperature of $\sim$1100 K. The most plausible way of generating SO$_2$ in
such an atmosphere is through photochemical processes. Here we show that the
SO$_2$ distribution computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly
explains the 4.05 $\mu$m spectral feature identified by JWST transmission
observations with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7$\sigma$) and G395H (4.5$\sigma$). SO$_2$
is produced by successive oxidation of sulphur radicals freed when hydrogen
sulphide (H$_2$S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO$_2$ feature to the
enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that it
can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an
inferred metallicity of $\sim$10$\times$ solar. We further point out that
SO$_2$ also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared
wavelengths not available from the existing observations.

range of core-mass fractions (CMFs). Imperfect collisions can preferentially
strip mantle material from a planet, changing its CMF, and are therefore
thought to be the most likely cause of this observed CMF variation. However,
previous work that implements these collisions into N-body simulations of
planet formation has struggled to reliably form high CMF super-Earths. In this
work, we specify our initial conditions and simulation parameters to maximize
the prevalence of high-energy, CMF-changing collisions in order to form planets
with highly diverse CMFs. High-energy collisions have a large $v_{imp}/v_{esc}$
ratio, so we maximize this ratio by starting simulations with high-eccentricity
and inclination disks to increase the difference in their orbital velocities,
maximizing $v_{imp}$. Additionally, we minimize $v_{esc}$ by starting with
small embryos. The final planets undergo more high-energy, debris-producing
collisions, and experience significant CMF change over their formation.
However, we find that a number of processes work together to average out the
CMF of a planet over time, therefore we do not consistently form high-CMF, high
mass planets. We do form high-CMF planets below 0.5 $M_{\oplus}$. Additionally,
we find in these highly eccentric environments, loss of debris mass due to
collisional grinding has a significant effect on final planet masses and CMFs,
resulting in smaller planets and a higher average planet CMF. This work
highlights the importance of improving measurements of high-density planets to
better constrain their CMFs.

transition that is reminiscent of the original Vicsek model: it has a

appearance of two dynamical states in the coexistence region: the PF (parallel

species A and species B move in opposite directions. When PF and APF states
exist in the low-density part of the coexistence region they perform stochastic
transitions from one to the other. The system size dependence of the transition

classical computers is known to scale exponentially with the number of lattice
sites. Due to a fundamentally different computational strategy, quantum
computers hold the promise of allowing for detailed studies of these dynamics
from first principles. However, much like with classical computations, it is
important that quantum algorithms do not have a cost that scales exponentially
with the volume. Recently, it was shown how to break the exponential scaling of
a naive implementation of a U(1) gauge theory in two spatial dimensions through
an operator redefinition. In this work, we describe modifications to how
operators must be sampled in the new operator basis to keep digitization errors
small. We compare the precision of the energies and plaquette expectation value
between the two operator bases and find they are comparable. Additionally, we
provide an explicit circuit construction for the Suzuki-Trotter implementation
of the theory using the Walsh function formalism. The gate count scaling is
studied as a function of the lattice volume, for both exact circuits and
approximate circuits where rotation gates with small arguments have been
dropped. We study the errors from finite Suzuki-Trotter time-step, circuit

as intrinsic motivation is prone to fail in stochastic environments, as the
agent may become hopelessly drawn to high-entropy areas of the state-action

aspects of world dynamics that are inherently predictable and aspects that are
inherently unpredictable: The former should constitute a source of intrinsic
reward, whereas the latter should not. In this work, we study a natural
solution derived from structural causal models of the world: Our key idea is to
learn representations of the future that capture precisely the unpredictable
aspects of each outcome -- not any more, not any less -- which we use as
additional input for predictions, such that intrinsic rewards do vanish in the

potentially mitigates this bottleneck, by enabling low-latency memory access
whose aggregate memory bandwidth scales with the number of PIM nodes. There is
an inherent tension, however, between minimizing inter-node communication and
achieving load balance in PIM systems, in the presence of workload skew. This
paper presents PIM-tree, an ordered index for PIM systems that achieves both
low communication and high load balance, regardless of the degree of skew in
the data and the queries. Our skew-resistant index is based on a novel division
of labor between the multi-core host CPU and the PIM nodes, which leverages the
strengths of each. We introduce push-pull search, which dynamically decides
whether to push queries to a PIM-tree node (CPU -> PIM-node) or pull the node's
keys back to the CPU (PIM-node -> CPU) based on workload skew. Combined with
other PIM-friendly optimizations (shadow subtrees and chunked skip lists), our
PIM-tree provides high-throughput, (guaranteed) low communication, and
(guaranteed) high load balance, for batches of point queries, updates, and
range scans.
  We implement the PIM-tree structure, in addition to prior proposed PIM

the throughput using PIM-trees is up to 69.7x and 59.1x higher than the two

lensing of wavelet based multi-scale higher order summary statistics: starlet
peak counts and starlet $\ell_1$-norm. Peak counts are the local maxima in the

considering the two probes as independent, starlet peaks and the $\ell_1$-norm
represent interesting summary statistics that can improve the constraints with
respect to the power spectrum also in the case of photometric galaxy clustering

require a high computation cost as compared to convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), one reason is that ViTs' attention measures global similarities and
thus has a quadratic complexity with the number of input tokens. Existing
efficient ViTs adopt local attention (e.g., Swin) or linear attention (e.g.,
Performer), which sacrifice ViTs' capabilities of capturing either global or
local context. In this work, we ask an important research question: Can ViTs
learn both global and local context while being more efficient during
inference? To this end, we propose a framework called Castling-ViT, which
trains ViTs using both linear-angular attention and masked softmax-based
quadratic attention, but then switches to having only linear angular attention
during ViT inference. Our Castling-ViT leverages angular kernels to measure the
similarities between queries and keys via spectral angles. And we further
simplify it with two techniques: (1) a novel linear-angular attention
mechanism: we decompose the angular kernels into linear terms and high-order
residuals, and only keep the linear terms; and (2) we adopt two parameterized
modules to approximate high-order residuals: a depthwise convolution and an
auxiliary masked softmax attention to help learn both global and local
information, where the masks for softmax attention are regularized to gradually
become zeros and thus incur no overhead during ViT inference. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies on three tasks consistently validate the
effectiveness of the proposed Castling-ViT, e.g., achieving up to a 1.8% higher

harm the agent. We assume the agent does not have the resources to re-train a
good policy. Instead, our defense mechanism sanitizes the backdoor policy by
projecting observed states to a 'safe subspace', estimated from a small number
of interactions with a clean (non-triggered) environment. Our sanitized policy
achieves $\epsilon$ approximate optimality in the presence of triggers,
provided the number of clean interactions is $O\left(\frac{D}{(1-\gamma)^4

no clear understanding of the dynamics of the magnetic field in stably

be unstable, developing mainly non-axisymmetric modes. Rotation and a small
poloidal field component may lead to a stable configuration. Here we perform
global MHD simulations with the EULAG-MHD code to explore the evolution of a
toroidal magnetic field located in a layer whose stratification resembles the
solar tachocline. Our numerical experiments allow us to explore the initial
unstable phase as well as the long-term evolution of the magnetic field. During
the first Alfven cycles, we observe the development of the Tayler instability
with the prominent longitudinal wavenumber, $m=1$. Rotation decreases the
growth rate of the instability, and eventually suppresses it. However, after a
stable phase, sudden energy surges lead to the development of higher order
modes even for fast rotation. These modes extract energy from the initial
toroidal field. Nevertheless, our results show that sufficiently fast rotation
leads to a lower saturation energy of the unstable modes, resulting in a
magnetic topology with only a small fraction of poloidal field which remains
steady for several hundreds of Alfven travel times. At this stage, the system
becomes turbulent and the field is prone to turbulent diffusion. The final
toroidal-poloidal configuration of the magnetic field may represent an
important aspect of the field generation and evolution in stably-stratified

the source of short-and long-term solar irradiance changes, spanning from one
minute to several months, and from one year to a few solar cycles,

other topics, including the photometric properties of solar disk features and
of the supergranulation manifested by the chromospheric network. Moreover, they
have been unique in allowing to connect series of historical and modern
full-disk solar observations, especially the Ca II K line data. Here, we
provide an overview of the Rome/PSPT telescope and of the solar monitoring
carried out with it from its first light to the present, across solar cycles
23-25. We also briefly describe the main results achieved with Rome/PSPT data,
and give an overview of new results being derived with the whole time series of

measurement for a transition starts only when all resources needed to fire it

transitions to fire (this is called urgency). For many systems, one wants to
decouple control and time, i.e. start measuring time as soon as a part of the
preset of a transition is filled, and fire it after some delay \underline{and}
when all needed resources are available. This paper considers an extension of
TPN called waiting nets that dissociates time measurement and control. Their
semantics allows time measurement to start with incomplete presets, and can
ignore urgency when upper bounds of intervals are reached but all resources
needed to fire are not yet available. Firing of a transition is then allowed as
soon as missing resources are available. It is known that extending bounded
TPNs with stopwatches leads to undecidability. Our extension is weaker, and we
show how to compute a finite state class graph for bounded waiting nets,
yielding decidability of reachability and coverability. We then compare
expressiveness of waiting nets with that of other models w.r.t. timed language
equivalence, and show that they are strictly more expressive than TPNs.

between the peculiarities of the GS phase diagram of the interacting system and

The mean-field Hamiltonian is given by six order parameters, which are

the long-range ordered modulations of the charge- (I) and antiferromagnetic

transition, charge- and spin-density modulations emerge within the sublattices
and have wavelengths equal to four lattice units. For moderate values of the
on-site repulsion the insulating phases are characterized by the presence of I

modulations within the one sublattice, or by the coexistence of I order and
additional AF spin density modulation only within the sublattice with high

broad and the early spectra are remarkably similar to SN 2009dc. Adopting a
redshift of $z=0.026 \pm 0.005$ for SN 2022ilv based on spectral matching, our
model light curve requires a large $^{56}$Ni mass in the range $0.7-1.5$
M$_{\odot}$, and a large ejecta mass in the range $1.6-2.3$ M$_{\odot}$. The
early excess can be explained by fast-moving SN ejecta interacting with a thin,
dense shell of circumstellar material close to the progenitor ($\sim 10^{13}$
cm), a few hours after the explosion. This may be realised in a
double-degenerate scenario, wherein a white dwarf merger is preceded by
ejection of a small amount ($\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$) of hydrogen and
helium-poor tidally stripped material. A deep pre-explosion Pan-STARRS1 stack

a surprisingly faint limit for any host of $M_r \gtrsim -11$, providing further
evidence that these types of explosion occur predominantly in low-metallicity

This bias comes from using the critic that is trained using the meta-learned
discount factor for the advantage estimation in the outer objective which
requires a different discount factor. Because the meta-learned discount factor
is typically lower than the one used in the outer objective, the resulting bias
can cause the meta-gradient to favor myopic policies. We propose a simple
solution to this issue: we eliminate this bias by using an alternative,
\emph{outer} value function in the estimation of the outer loss. To obtain this
outer value function we add a second head to the critic network and train it
alongside the classic critic, using the outer loss discount factor. On an

greenhouse effect that left highlands too cold for liquid water except during a

  Deterministic Algorithms for Graph Cut Problems",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Expander graphs play a central role in graph theory and algorithms. With a
number of powerful algorithmic tools developed around them, such as the
Cut-Matching game, expander pruning, expander decomposition, and algorithms for
decremental All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) in expanders, to name just a few,
the use of expanders in the design of graph algorithms has become ubiquitous.
Specific applications of interest to us are fast deterministic algorithms for
cut problems in static graphs, and algorithms for dynamic distance-based graph
problems, such as APSP.
  Unfortunately, the use of expanders in these settings incurs a number of
drawbacks. For example, the best currently known algorithm for decremental APSP
in constant-degree expanders can only achieve a $(\log
n)^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$-approximation with $n^{1+O(\epsilon)}$ total update time
for any $\epsilon$. All currently known algorithms for the Cut Player in the
Cut-Matching game are either randomized, or provide rather weak guarantees.
This, in turn, leads to somewhat weak algorithmic guarantees for several
central cut problems: for example, the best current almost linear time
deterministic algorithm for Sparsest Cut can only achieve approximation factor
$(\log n)^{\omega(1)}$. Lastly, when relying on expanders in distance-based
problems, such as dynamic APSP, via current methods, it seems inevitable that
one has to settle for approximation factors that are at least $\Omega(\log n)$.
  In this paper we propose the use of well-connected graphs, and introduce a
new algorithmic toolkit for such graphs that, in a sense, mirrors the above
mentioned algorithmic tools for expanders. One of these new tools is the
Distanced Matching game, an analogue of the Cut-Matching game for

actually live on low-dimensional manifolds, sometimes known as the manifold
hypothesis, underlies much of our intuition for how and why deep learning
works. Despite the central role that they play in our intuition, data manifolds
are surprisingly hard to measure in the case of high-dimensional, sparsely
sampled image datasets. This is particularly frustrating since the capability
to measure data manifolds would provide a revealing window into the inner
workings and dynamics of deep learning models. Motivated by this, we introduce
neural frames, a novel and easy to use tool inspired by the notion of a frame
from differential geometry. Neural frames can be used to explore the local
neighborhoods of data manifolds as they pass through the hidden layers of
neural networks even when one only has a single datapoint available. We present
a mathematical framework for neural frames and explore some of their
properties. We then use them to make a range of observations about how modern
model architectures and training routines, such as heavy augmentation and
adversarial training, affect the local behavior of a model.

develop a relativistic model of an inertial detector following two different
approaches, starting from either a first- or second-quantized treatment, which
enables us to compare the fundamental differences between the two schemes. In
particular, we find that the notion of localization is different between the
two models, and leads to distinct predictions, which we study by comparing the
spontaneous emission rates for the UDW detector interacting with a massless
scalar field. Furthermore, we consider the UDW system in both a vacuum and
medium, and compare our results to existing models describing a classical or
quantized c.m. at low energies. We find that the predictions of each model,

distinguished, and our results can be further extended to find optimal detector
states and processes to perform such experiments. This would clarify both the

standard practice is to fine-tune large-scale VLPMs pre-trained on huge

reality, the application domain can change over time, necessitating VLPMs to
continually learn and adapt to new domains without forgetting previously
acquired knowledge. Most existing continual learning (CL) research concentrates

due to its wide variety of applications. Recent methods attempt to introduce
linguistic knowledge for challenging recognition rather than pure visual
classification. However, how to effectively model the linguistic rules in
end-to-end deep networks remains a research challenge. In this paper, we argue
that the limited capacity of language models comes from 1) implicit language
modeling; 2) unidirectional feature representation; and 3) language model with
noise input. Correspondingly, we propose an autonomous, bidirectional and
iterative ABINet++ for scene text spotting. Firstly, the autonomous suggests
enforcing explicitly language modeling by decoupling the recognizer into vision
model and language model and blocking gradient flow between both models.
Secondly, a novel bidirectional cloze network (BCN) as the language model is
proposed based on bidirectional feature representation. Thirdly, we propose an
execution manner of iterative correction for the language model which can
effectively alleviate the impact of noise input. Finally, to polish ABINet++ in
long text recognition, we propose to aggregate horizontal features by embedding
Transformer units inside a U-Net, and design a position and content attention
module which integrates character order and content to attend to character
features precisely. ABINet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
scene text recognition and scene text spotting benchmarks, which consistently
demonstrates the superiority of our method in various environments especially
on low-quality images. Besides, extensive experiments including in English and
Chinese also prove that, a text spotter that incorporates our language modeling

optimization pitfalls, the most deceptive of which is that we can only build a
deep model by solving over-smoothing. The fundamental reason is that we do not
understand how graph neural networks work. Stress graph drawing can offer a
unique viewpoint to message iteration in the graph, such as the root of the
over-smoothing problem lies in the inability of graph models to maintain an
ideal distance between nodes. We further elucidate the trigger conditions of
over-smoothing and propose Stress Graph Neural Networks. By introducing the
attractive and repulsive message passing from stress iteration, we show how to
build a deep model without preventing over-smoothing, how to use repulsive
information, and how to optimize the current message-passing scheme to
approximate the full stress message propagation. By performing different tasks
on 23 datasets, we verified the effectiveness of our attractive and repulsive
models and the derived relationship between stress iteration and graph neural
networks. We believe that stress graph drawing will be a popular resource for
understanding and designing graph neural networks.

to multi-view/scale/timestamp image features to sample corresponding features;
(2) Hierarchy Feature Fusion: we hierarchically fuse sampled features of
different view/scale, different timestamp and different keypoints to generate
high-quality instance feature. In this way, Sparse4D can efficiently and
effectively achieve 3D detection without relying on dense view transformation

of extracting gait features from images, this work explores precise 3D gait
features from point clouds and proposes a simple yet efficient 3D gait

point clouds into depth maps to learn the representations with 3D geometry
information, which outperforms existing point-wise and camera-based methods by
a significant margin. Due to the lack of point cloud datasets, we built the
first large-scale LiDAR-based gait recognition dataset, SUSTech1K, collected by
a LiDAR sensor and an RGB camera. The dataset contains 25,239 sequences from
1,050 subjects and covers many variations, including visibility, views,
occlusions, clothing, carrying, and scenes. Extensive experiments show that (1)
3D structure information serves as a significant feature for gait recognition.
(2) LidarGait outperforms existing point-based and silhouette-based methods by
a significant margin, while it also offers stable cross-view results. (3) The
LiDAR sensor is superior to the RGB camera for gait recognition in the outdoor

discretisation matrices resulted from the Legendre dual-Petrov-Galerkin (LDPG)
method for the $m$th-order initial value problem (IVP): $u^{(m)}(t)=\sigma
u(t),\, t\in (-1,1)$ with constant $\sigma\not=0$ and usual initial conditions
at $t=-1,$ are associated with the generalised Bessel polynomials (GBPs). The
essential idea of the analysis is to properly construct the basis functions for
the solution and its dual spaces so that the matrix of the $m$th derivative is
an identity matrix, and the mass matrix is then identical or approximately
equals to the Jacobi matrix of the three-term recurrence of GBPs with specific
integer parameters. This allows us to characterise the eigenvalue distributions
and identify the eigenvectors. As a by-product, we are able to answer some open
questions related to the very limited known results on the collocation method
at Legendre points (studied in 1980s) for the first-order IVP, by reformulating
it into a Petrov-Galerkin formulation. Moreover, we present two stable
algorithms for computing zeros of the GBPs, and develop a general space-time
spectral method for evolutionary PDEs using either the matrix diagonalisation,
which is restricted to a small number of unknowns in time due to the
ill-conditioning but is fully parallel, or the QZ decomposition which is
numerically stable for a large number of unknowns in time but involves
sequential computations. We provide ample numerical results to demonstrate the
high accuracy and robustness of the space-time spectral methods for some
interesting examples of linear and nonlinear wave problems.

noisy maximally entangled states. Fully quantum nonlocal games are a
generalization of nonlocal games, where both questions and answers are quantum
and the referee performs a binary POVM measurement to decide whether they win
the game after receiving the quantum answers from the players. The quantum
value of a fully quantum nonlocal game is the supremum of the probability that
they win the game, where the supremum is taken over all the possible entangled
states shared between the players and all the valid quantum operations
performed by the players. The seminal work $\mathrm{MIP}^*=\mathrm{RE}$ implies
that it is undecidable to approximate the quantum value of a fully nonlocal
game. This still holds even if the players are only allowed to share
(arbitrarily many copies of) maximally entangled states. This paper
investigates the case that the shared maximally entangled states are noisy. We
prove that there is a computable upper bound on the copies of noisy maximally
entangled states for the players to win a fully quantum nonlocal game with a
probability arbitrarily close to the quantum value. This implies that it is
decidable to approximate the quantum values of these games. Hence, the hardness
of approximating the quantum value of a fully quantum nonlocal game is not
robust against the noise in the shared states.
  This paper is built on the framework for the decidability of non-interactive
simulations of joint distributions and generalizes the analogous result for
nonlocal games. We extend the theory of Fourier analysis to the space of
super-operators and prove several key results including an invariance principle
and a dimension reduction for super-operators. These results are interesting in
their own right and are believed to have further applications.

important way to understand the evolution of our universe. In this paper, we
explore the feasibility of detecting the SGWB generated by the loops, which
arose throughout the cosmological evolution of the cosmic string network, by
individual space detectors (e.g.~LISA, TAIJI) and joint space detectors
(LISA-TAIJI). For joint detectors, we choose three different configurations of
TAIJI (e.g.~TAIJIm, TAIJIp, TAIJIc) to form the LISA-TAIJI networks. And we
investigate the performance of them to detect the SGWB. Though comparing the
power-law sensitivity (PLS) curves of individual space detectors and joint
detectors with energy density spectrum of SGWB. We find that LISA-TAIJIc has
the best sensitivity for detecting the SGWB from cosmic string loops and is
promising to further constrains the tension of cosmic sting $G\mu=O(10^{-17})$.

applications, from cloth simulation to object manipulation. Recent methods
using smoothed friction forces have enabled robust and differentiable
simulation of elastodynamics with friction. However, the resulting frictional
behaviors can be qualitatively inaccurate and may not converge to analytic
solutions. Here we propose an alternative, fully implicit, formulation for
simulating elastodynamics subject to frictional contacts with realistic
friction behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate how higher-order time
integration can be used in our method, as well as in incremental potential
methods. We develop an inexact Newton method with forward-mode automatic
differentiation that simplifies the implementation and improves performance.
Finally, we show how our method can be extended to respond to volume changes
using a unified penalty function derived from first principles and capable of
emulating compressible as well as nearly incompressible media.

been achieved over the past decade. This has set the stage for the discovery of
leptonic CP violation (LCPV) at high confidence level in the next-generation
long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we explore in
detail the possible complementarity among the on-axis DUNE and off-axis T2HK
experiments to enhance the sensitivity to LCPV suppressing the
$\theta_{23}-\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ degeneracy. We find that none of these
experiments individually can achieve the milestone of 3$\sigma$ LCPV for at
least 75% choices of $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ in its entire range of
$[-180^{\circ} , 180^{\circ}]$, with their nominal exposures and systematic
uncertainties. However, their combination can attain the same for all values of
$\theta_{23}$ with only half of their nominal exposures. We observe that the
proposed T2HKK setup in combination with DUNE can further increase the CP
coverage to more than 80% with only half of their nominal exposures. We study
in detail how the coverage in $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ for $\ge$ 3$\sigma$ LCPV
depends on the choice of $\theta_{23}$, exposure, optimal runtime in neutrino

isolation and combination. We find that with an improved systematic uncertainty
of 2.7% in appearance mode, the standalone T2HK setup can provide a CP coverage

potential for learning image representations. Existing works generally adopt
the regular Transformer to model the visual content relationships, ignoring the
cues of semantic/label correlations between samples. Also, they generally adopt
the ""full"" self-attention mechanism which are obviously redundant and also
sensitive to the noisy samples. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we
design a simple yet flexible Batch-Graph Transformer (BGFormer) for mini-batch
sample representations by deeply capturing the relationships of image samples
from both visual and semantic perspectives. BGFormer has three main aspects.
(1) It employs a flexible graph model, termed Batch Graph to jointly encode the
visual and semantic relationships of samples within each mini-batch. (2) It
explores the neighborhood relationships of samples by borrowing the idea of
sparse graph representation which thus performs robustly, w.r.t., noisy
samples. (3) It devises a novel Transformer architecture that mainly adopts
dual structure-constrained self-attention (SSA), together with graph
normalization, FFN, etc, to carefully exploit the batch graph information for
sample tokens (nodes) representations. As an application, we apply BGFormer to
the metric learning tasks. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

transitions in a signal trace, dynamic digital timing analysis offers a less
accurate but much faster alternative to analog simulations of digital circuits.
This primarily requires gate delay models that also account for the fact that
the input-to-output delay of a particular input transition also depends on the
temporal distance to the previous output transitions. In the case of
multi-input gates, the delay also experiences variations caused by multi-input
switching (MIS) effects, i.e., transitions at different inputs that occur in
close temporal proximity. In this paper, we advocate the development of hybrid
delay models for CMOS gates obtained by replacing transistors with time-variant
resistors. We exemplify our approach by applying it to a NOR gate (and, hence,
to the dual NAND gate) and a Muller C gate. We analytically solve the resulting
first-order differential equations with non-constant-coefficients, and derive
analytic expressions for the resulting MIS gate delays. The resulting formulas
not only pave the way to a sound model parametrization procedure, but are also
instrumental for implementing fast and efficient digital timing simulation. By

GNN, integrates label propagation to achieve superior performance, but with the
dilemma between its propagating distance and adaptiveness. IGNN, outputting an
equilibrium point by iterating its network infinite times, exploits information
in the entire graph to capture long-range dependencies, but with its network
constrained to guarantee the existence of the equilibrium. This work unifies
the two subdomains by interpreting LGNN in the theory of IGNN and reducing
prevailing LGNNs to the form of IGNN. The unification facilitates the exchange
between the two subdomains and inspires more studies. Specifically, implicit
differentiation of IGNN is introduced to LGNN to differentiate its
infinite-range label propagation with constant memory, making the propagation
both distant and adaptive. Besides, the masked label strategy of LGNN is proven
able to guarantee the well-posedness of IGNN in a network-agnostic manner,
granting its network more complex and thus more expressive. Combining the
advantages of LGNN and IGNN, Label-inputted Implicit GNN (LI-GNN) is proposed.
It can be widely applied to any specific GNN to boost its performance. Node

concepts providing explainability and intervention during inference by
correcting the predicted, intermediate concepts. This makes CBMs attractive for
high-stakes decision-making. In this paper, we take the quality assessment of
fetal ultrasound scans as a real-life use case for CBM decision support in
healthcare. For this case, simple binary concepts are not sufficiently
reliable, as they are mapped directly from images of highly variable quality,
for which variable model calibration might lead to unstable binarized concepts.
Moreover, scalar concepts do not provide the intuitive spatial feedback
requested by users.
  To address this, we design a hierarchical CBM imitating the sequential expert
decision-making process of ""seeing"", ""conceiving"" and ""concluding"". Our model
first passes through a layer of visual, segmentation-based concepts, and next a
second layer of property concepts directly associated with the decision-making
task. We note that experts can intervene on both the visual and property
concepts during inference. Additionally, we increase the bottleneck capacity by
considering task-relevant concept interaction.
  Our application of ultrasound scan quality assessment is challenging, as it
relies on balancing the (often poor) image quality against an assessment of the
visibility and geometric properties of standardized image content. Our
validation shows that -- in contrast with previous CBM models -- our CBM models
actually outperform equivalent concept-free models in terms of predictive
performance. Moreover, we illustrate how interventions can further improve our

galaxy catalogues capable of generating accurate covariance matrices for a
number of cosmological probes that are expected to be measured in current and
forthcoming galaxy redshift surveys (e.g. two- and three-point statistics). We
use the bias assignment method (BAM) to model the statistics of halo
distribution through a learning algorithm using a few detailed $N$-body
simulations, and approximated gravity solvers based on Lagrangian perturbation
theory. Using specific models of halo occupation distributions, we generate
galaxy mocks with the expected number density and central-satellite fraction of
emission-line galaxies, which are a key target of the DESI experiment. BAM
generates mock catalogues with per cent accuracy in a number of summary
statistics, such as the abundance, the two- and three-point statistics of halo
distributions, both in real and redshift space. In particular, the mock galaxy
catalogues display $\sim 3\%-10\%$ accuracy in the multipoles of the power
spectrum up to scales of $k\sim 0.4\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We show that covariance
matrices of two- and three-point statistics obtained with BAM display a similar
structure to the reference simulation. BAM offers an efficient way to produce
mock halo catalogues with accurate two- and three-point statistics, and is able
to generate a variety of multi-tracer catalogues with precise covariance
matrices of several cosmological probes. We discuss future developments of the
algorithm towards mock production in DESI and other galaxy-redshift surveys.

localization due to its major advantage of not requiring new infrastructure and
dedicated devices. The number and the distribution of Reference Points (RPs)
for the measurement of localization fingerprints like RSSI during the offline
phase, however, greatly affects the localization accuracy; for instance, the
UJIIndoorLoc is known to have the issue of uneven spatial distribution of RPs
over buildings and floors. Data augmentation has been proposed as a feasible
solution to not only improve the smaller number and the uneven distribution of
RPs in the existing fingerprint databases but also reduce the labor and time
costs of constructing new fingerprint databases. In this paper, we propose the
multidimensional augmentation of fingerprint data for indoor localization in a
large-scale building complex based on Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) and
systematically investigate the impact of augmentation ratio as well as MOGP
kernel functions and models with their hyperparameters on the performance of
indoor localization using the UJIIndoorLoc database and the state-of-the-art
neural network indoor localization model based on a hierarchical RNN. The
investigation based on experimental results suggests that we can generate
synthetic RSSI fingerprint data up to ten times the original data -- i.e., the
augmentation ratio of 10 -- through the proposed multidimensional MOGP-based
data augmentation without significantly affecting the indoor localization
performance compared to that of the original data alone, which extends the
spatial coverage of the combined RPs and thereby could improve the localization
performance at the locations that are not part of the test dataset.

seeks to learn the optimal downscaled representations, i.e., low-resolution
(LR) images, to reconstruct the original high-resolution (HR) images. Compared
with super-resolution methods that consider a fixed downscaling scheme, e.g.,
bicubic, IR often achieves significantly better reconstruction performance
thanks to the learned downscaled representations. This highlights the
importance of a good downscaled representation in image reconstruction tasks.
Existing IR methods mainly learn the downscaled representation by jointly
optimizing the downscaling and upscaling models. Unlike them, we seek to
improve the downscaled representation through a different and more direct way:
optimizing the downscaled image itself instead of the down-/upscaling models.
Specifically, we propose a collaborative downscaling scheme that directly
generates the collaborative LR examples by descending the gradient w.r.t. the
reconstruction loss on them to benefit the IR process. Furthermore, since LR
images are downscaled from the corresponding HR images, one can also improve
the downscaled representation if we have a better representation in the HR
domain. Inspired by this, we propose a Hierarchical Collaborative Downscaling
(HCD) method that performs gradient descent in both HR and LR domains to
improve the downscaled representations. Extensive experiments show that our HCD
significantly improves the reconstruction performance both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Moreover, we also highlight the flexibility of our HCD since it
can generalize well across diverse IR models.

well-suited for virtual reality and augmented reality applications, point
clouds have gained a lot of popularity. In order to reduce the huge amount of
data, a considerable amount of research on point cloud compression has been
done. However, given a target bit rate, how to properly choose the color and
geometry quantization parameters for compressing point clouds is still an open
issue. In this paper, we propose a rate-distortion model based quantization
parameter selection scheme for bit rate constrained point cloud compression.
Firstly, to overcome the measurement uncertainty in evaluating the distortion
of the point clouds, we propose a unified model to combine the geometry
distortion and color distortion. In this model, we take into account the
correlation between geometry and color variables of point clouds and derive a
dimensionless quantity to represent the overall quality degradation. Then, we
derive the relationships of overall distortion and bit rate with the
quantization parameters. Finally, we formulate the bit rate constrained point
cloud compression as a constrained minimization problem using the derived
polynomial models and deduce the solution via an iterative numerical method.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve optimal
decoded point cloud quality at various target bit rates, and substantially
outperform the video-rate-distortion model based point cloud compression
scheme.

SRS data that considers multiple individual records, mutli-valued sensitive

solving cross-release attacks caused by the follow-up cases in the periodical

the original SDUGKS is adopted in the proposed method in the reconstruction of
energy flux across cell interface, just as the unsteady DUGKS. By this way, the
characteristic line length of the modified SDUGKS establishes a relationship
with the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number in the DUGKS, which guarantees
the accuracy of the modified SDUGKS. Furthermore, the characteristic line
length is no longer limited by the extinction coefficient like in original
SDUGKS. As a result, the modified SDUGKS is more accurate and robust than
original SDUGKS, and more efficient than the DUGKS for steady radiation
problems. Furthermore, the smooth linear interpolation and the van Leer limiter
are used for problems with smooth and discontinuous optical thicknesses,
respectively. Several numerical tests with optical thickness varying from
optical thin to thick are conducted to validate the present scheme. Numerical
results demonstrate that the modified SDUGKS can serve as an effective tool in

generative process remains in the same high dimensional (i.e. identical to data

to the extremely high memory and computational cost. In this paper, we combine
the ideas from the conventional model-based iterative reconstruction with the

GEneration (EDGE), a state-of-the-art method for editable dance generation that
is capable of creating realistic, physically-plausible dances while remaining
faithful to the input music. EDGE uses a transformer-based diffusion model
paired with Jukebox, a strong music feature extractor, and confers powerful
editing capabilities well-suited to dance, including joint-wise conditioning,
and in-betweening. We introduce a new metric for physical plausibility, and
evaluate dance quality generated by our method extensively through (1) multiple
quantitative metrics on physical plausibility, beat alignment, and diversity
benchmarks, and more importantly, (2) a large-scale user study, demonstrating a
significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative

attention. However, most of the existing studies mainly rely on the
coarse-grain audio features at the instance level to generate adversarial
noises, which leads to expensive generation time costs and weak universal
attacking ability. Motivated by the observations that all audio speech consists
of fundamental phonemes, this paper proposes a phonemic adversarial tack (PAT)
paradigm, which attacks the fine-grain audio features at the phoneme level
commonly shared across audio instances, to generate phonemic adversarial
noises, enjoying the more general attacking ability with fast generation speed.
Specifically, for accelerating the generation, a phoneme density balanced
sampling strategy is introduced to sample quantity less but phonemic features
abundant audio instances as the training data via estimating the phoneme
density, which substantially alleviates the heavy dependency on the large
training dataset. Moreover, for promoting universal attacking ability, the
phonemic noise is optimized in an asynchronous way with a sliding window, which
enhances the phoneme diversity and thus well captures the critical fundamental
phonemic patterns. By conducting extensive experiments, we comprehensively
investigate the proposed PAT framework and demonstrate that it outperforms the
SOTA baselines by large margins (i.e., at least 11X speed up and 78% attacking
ability improvement).

of that assembly, and other work has shown how to generate C code automatically
along with formal proof, but with consequent performance penalties vs. the

significantly faster than what GCC or Clang produce, with mechanized proof (in

generate a random or average timbre without any controls or specializations of
the generated sound timbre, leading to the problem that people cannot obtain
the desired timbre under these methods sometimes. In this paper, we pose the
task of generating sound with a specific timbre given a video input and a
reference audio sample. To solve this task, we disentangle each target sound
audio into three components: temporal information, acoustic information, and
background information. We first use three encoders to encode these components
respectively: 1) a temporal encoder to encode temporal information, which is
fed with video frames since the input video shares the same temporal
information as the original audio; 2) an acoustic encoder to encode timbre
information, which takes the original audio as input and discards its temporal
information by a temporal-corrupting operation; and 3) a background encoder to
encode the residual or background sound, which uses the background part of the
original audio as input. To make the generated result achieve better quality
and temporal alignment, we also adopt a mel discriminator and a temporal
discriminator for the adversarial training. Our experimental results on the VAS
dataset demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality audio samples
with good synchronization with events in video and high timbre similarity with
the reference audio.

two string $s, s'\in\{0, 1\}^n$ satisfying the above constraints, for any
$x\in\{0, 1\}^n$ the max inner product oracle $O_{max}(x)$ returns the max
value between $s\cdot x$ and $s'\cdot x$, and the sub-set oracle $O_{sub}(x)$
indicates whether the index set of the 1s in $x$ is a subset of that in $s$ or
$s'$. We present a quantum algorithm consuming $O(1)$ queries to the max inner

randomly coupled can show an asynchronous activity in which there are no
significant correlations among the units of the network. The asynchronous state
can nevertheless exhibit a rich temporal correlation statistics, that is
generally difficult to capture theoretically. For randomly coupled rotator
networks, it is possible to derive differential equations that determine the
autocorrelation functions of the network noise and of the single elements in
the network. So far, the theory has been restricted to statistically
homogeneous networks, making it difficult to apply this framework to real-world
networks, which are structured with respect to the properties of the single
units and their connectivity. A particularly striking case are neural networks
for which one has to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neurons,
which drive their target neurons towards or away from firing threshold. To take
into account network structures like that, here we extend the theory for
rotator networks to the case of multiple populations. Specifically, we derive a
system of differential equations that govern the self-consistent
autocorrelation functions of the network fluctuations in the respective
populations. We then apply this general theory to the special but important
case of recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory units in the balanced
case and compare our theory to numerical simulations. We inspect the effect of
the network structure on the noise statistics by comparing our results to the
case of an equivalent homogeneous network devoid of internal structure. Our
results show that structured connectivity and heterogeneity of the oscillator
type can both enhance or reduce the overall strength of the generated network
noise and shape its temporal correlations.

people. The online connections made by users allows information to spread more
easily than traditional news media (e.g., newspaper, television). However, they
also make the spread of fake news easier than in traditional media, especially
through the users' social network connections. In this paper, we focus on
investigating if the SNs' users connection structure can aid fake news
detection on Twitter. In particular, we propose to embed users based on their
follower or friendship networks on the Twitter platform, so as to identify the
groups that users form. Indeed, by applying unsupervised graph embedding
methods on the graphs from the Twitter users' social network connections, we
observe that users engaged with fake news are more tightly clustered together
than users only engaged in factual news. Thus, we hypothesise that the embedded
user's network can help detect fake news effectively. Through extensive
experiments using a publicly available Twitter dataset, our results show that
applying graph embedding methods on SNs, using the user connections as network
information, can indeed classify fake news more effectively than most
language-based approaches. Specifically, we observe a significant improvement
over using only the textual information (i.e., TF.IDF or a BERT language
model), as well as over models that deploy both advanced textual features
(i.e., stance detection) and complex network features (e.g., users network,
publishers cross citations). We conclude that the Twitter users' friendship and

systems for studying disorder and interaction effects for almost 50 years. In
particular, strong disorder drives the metallic 2D carriers into a strongly
localized Anderson insulator (AI) at low densities whereas pristine 2D
electrons in the presence of no (or little) disorder should solidify into a
Wigner crystal at low carrier densities. Since the disorder in 2D
semiconductors is mostly Coulomb disorder arising from random charged
impurities, the applicable physics is complex as the carriers interact with
each other as well as with the random charged impurities through the same
long-range Coulomb coupling. By critically theoretically analyzing the
experimental transport data in depth using a realistic transport theory to
calculate the low-temperature 2D resistivity as a function of carrier density
in 11 different experimental samples covering 9 different materials, we
establish, utilizing the Ioffe-Regel-Mott criterion for strong localization, a
direct connection between the critical localization density for the 2D
metal-insulator transition (MIT) and the sample mobility deep into the metallic
state, which for clean samples could lead to a localization density low enough
to make the transition appear to be a Wigner crystallization. We believe that
the insulating phase is always an effective Coulomb disorder-induced localized
AI, which may have short-range WC-like correlations at low carrier densities.
Our theoretically calculated disorder-driven critical MIT density agrees with
experimental findings in all 2D samples, even for the ultra-clean samples. In
particular, the extrapolated critical density for the 2D MIT seems to vanish
when the high-density mobility goes to infinity, indicating that transport
probes a disorder-localized insulating ground state independent of how low the
carrier density might be.

Regressor and Extension (MRE) approaches are extended. The solution of the
virtual control law is identified by the P&I approach. The P&I approach is
based on the choice of an appropriate implicit manifold and the generation of a
suitable passive output and a related storage function. This facilitates the
virtual control law being obtained in a way that the parametric error converges
asymptotically to zero. Because the above ideas connect with the P&I approach
and GE, the developed methodology is labeled the passivity and immersion-based
modified gradient estimator (MGE). The proposed P&I-based modified gradient

learn the combined state-object representation, challenging the generalization

them. To jointly eliminate the above issues and construct a more robust CZSL
system, we propose a novel framework termed Decomposed Fusion with Soft Prompt

recognition. Specifically, DFSP constructs a vector combination of learnable
soft prompts with state and object to establish the joint representation of
them. In addition, a cross-modal decomposed fusion module is designed between
the language and image branches, which decomposes state and object among
language features instead of image features. Notably, being fused with the
decomposed features, the image features can be more expressive for learning the
relationship with states and objects, respectively, to improve the response of
unseen compositions in the pair space, hence narrowing the domain gap between
seen and unseen sets. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks

personalized federated learning (PFL for simplification) aims to improve the

local data, otherwise focuses on the prior. When Bayesian learning is applied

training process. In this paper, we employ Bayesian learning to model PFL by
assuming a prior in the scaled exponential family, and therefore propose
pFedBreD, a framework to solve the problem we model using Bregman divergence

language processing. It aims to assign multiple target labels to one document.
Due to the uneven popularity of labels, the number of documents per label
follows a long-tailed distribution in most cases. It is much more challenging
to learn classifiers for data-scarce tail labels than for data-rich head
labels. The main reason is that head labels usually have sufficient
information, e.g., a large intra-class diversity, while tail labels do not. In
response, we propose a Pairwise Instance Relation Augmentation Network (PIRAN)
to augment tailed-label documents for balancing tail labels and head labels.
PIRAN consists of a relation collector and an instance generator. The former
aims to extract the document pairwise relations from head labels. Taking these
relations as perturbations, the latter tries to generate new document instances
in high-level feature space around the limited given tailed-label instances.
Meanwhile, two regularizers (diversity and consistency) are designed to
constrain the generation process. The consistency-regularizer encourages the
variance of tail labels to be close to head labels and further balances the
whole datasets. And diversity-regularizer makes sure the generated instances
have diversity and avoids generating redundant instances. Extensive
experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIRAN
consistently outperforms the SOTA methods, and dramatically improves the
performance of tail labels.

characterize the dynamics of training machine learning models with SGD. This
provides two opportunities for better understanding the generalization
behaviour of SGD through its SDE approximation. First, under the SDE
characterization, SGD may be regarded as the full-batch gradient descent with
Gaussian gradient noise. This allows the application of the generalization
bounds developed by Xu & Raginsky (2017) to analyzing the generalization
behaviour of SGD, resulting in upper bounds in terms of the mutual information
between the training set and the training trajectory. Second, under mild
assumptions, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the steady-state weight
distribution of SDE. Using this estimate, we apply the PAC-Bayes-like
information-theoretic bounds developed in both Xu & Raginsky (2017) and Negrea
et al. (2019) to obtain generalization upper bounds in terms of the KL
divergence between the steady-state weight distribution of SGD with respect to
a prior distribution. Among various options, one may choose the prior as the
steady-state weight distribution obtained by SGD on the same training set but
with one example held out. In this case, the bound can be elegantly expressed
using the influence function (Koh & Liang, 2017), which suggests that the
generalization of the SGD is related to the stability of SGD. Various insights
are presented along the development of these bounds, which are subsequently
validated numerically.

SagDIG. $10$ LPV candidates were in common with previous studies, including one
very dusty AGB (x-AGB). By adopting the metallicity $Z = 0.0002$ for older

from intrachannel electron scattering. The general formulas for local

applied voltage/current. Two circuit regimes with stabilized current and
stabilized voltage are considered. The noise intensities for the devices with

applications is a challenging endeavor, which immersed boundary and cut-cell
techniques can significantly simplify by alleviating the meshing process
required by body-fitted meshes. These methods however introduce new challenges,
as the formulation of accurate and well-posed discrete operators becomes
nontrivial. Here, a conservative cartesian cut cell method is proposed for the
solution of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equation on staggered Cartesian
grids. Emphasis is set on the structure of the discrete operators, designed to
mimic the properties of the continuous ones while retaining a nearest-neighbor
stencil. For convective transport, a divergence is proposed and shown to also
be skew-symmetric as long as the divergence-free condition is satisfied,
ensuring mass, momentum and kinetic energy conservation (the latter in the
inviscid limit). For viscous transport, conservative and symmetric operators
are proposed for Dirichlet boundary conditions. Symmetry ensures the existence
of a sink term (viscous dissipation) in the discrete kinetic energy budget,
which is beneficial for stability. The cut-cell discretization possesses the
much desired summation-by-parts (SBP) properties. In addition, it is fully
conservative, mathematically provably stable and supports arbitrary geometries.
The accuracy and robustness of the method are then demonstrated with flows past
a circular cylinder and an airfoil.

the ``virtual particle trajectory'' approach and obtained the mass flux,
poloidal and toroidal velocities, and mass-flux-weighted momentum and energy

obtained based on the time-averaged streamline method widely used in

locally in the non-canonical forms A (with a narrow major groove and a large
amount of north sugars) or C (with a narrow minor groove and a large share of
BII phosphates). To model the formation of such complexes by molecular dynamics
methods, the force field is required to reproduce these conformational
transitions for a naked DNA. We analyzed the available experimental data on the
B-C and B-A transitions under the conditions easily implemented in modeling: in
an aqueous NaCl solution. We selected six DNA duplexes which conformations at
different salt concentrations are known reliably enough. At low salt
concentrations, poly(GC) and poly(A) are in the B-form, classical and slightly
shifted to the A-form, respectively. The duplexes ATAT and GGTATACC have a
strong and salt concentration dependent bias toward the A-form. The polymers
poly(AC) and poly(G) take the C- and A-forms, respectively, at high salt
concentrations. The reproduction of the behavior of these oligomers can serve
as a test for the balance of interactions between the base stacking and the
conformational flexibility of the sugar-phosphate backbone in a DNA force
field. We tested the AMBER bsc1 and CHARMM36 force fields and their hybrids,

concentration dependence is very weak. The known B-philicity of the AMBER force

the flow fields for both person and garment images conditioned on the target

then used to modulate the target pose's feature map for target try-on image

the successful developments of LiDAR-based UAVs must rely on extensive
simulations. Existing simulators can hardly perform simulations of real-world

scenes for LiDAR-based UAVs. The key idea is the underlying point rendering
method, where we construct a depth image directly from the point cloud map and
interpolate it to obtain realistic LiDAR point measurements. Our developed
simulator is able to run on a light-weight computing platform and supports the
simulation of LiDARs with different resolution and scanning patterns, dynamic
obstacles, and multi-UAV systems. Developed in the ROS framework, the simulator
can easily communicate with other key modules of an autonomous robot, such as
perception, state estimation, planning, and control. Finally, the simulator
provides 10 high-resolution point cloud maps of various real-world
environments, including forests of different densities, historic building,
office, parking garage, and various complex indoor environments. These
realistic maps provide diverse testing scenarios for an autonomous UAV.
Evaluation results show that the developed simulator achieves superior
performance in terms of time and memory consumption against Gazebo and that the
simulated UAV flights highly match the actual one in real-world environments.
We believe such a point-realistic and light-weight simulator is crucial to
bridge the gap between UAV simulation and experiments and will significantly

difference induces an energy current, the proportionality factor between these
two quantities being the thermal conductivity. From an abstract point of view,
transport coefficients can also be considered as some form of sensitivity
analysis with respect to an added forcing to the baseline dynamics. There are
various numerical techniques to estimate transport coefficients, which all
suffer from large errors, in particular large statistical errors. This
contribution reviews the most popular methods, namely the Green-Kubo approach
where the transport coefficient is expressed as some time-integrated
correlation function, and the approach based on longtime averages of the
stochastic dynamics perturbed by an external driving (so-called nonequilibrium
molecular dynamics). In each case, the various sources of errors are made
precise, in particular the bias related to the time discretization of the
underlying continuous dynamics, and the variance of the associated Monte Carlo
estimators. Some recent alternative techniques to estimate transport
coefficients are also discussed.

Jupiter near its L4 and L5 Lagrange points. The study of Jupiter Trojans is
crucial for testing different models of planet formation that are directly
related to our understanding of solar system evolution. In this work, we select
known Jupiter Trojans listed by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) from the full six
years dataset (Y6) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to analyze their photometric
properties. The DES data allow us to study Jupiter Trojans with a fainter
magnitude limit than previous studies in a homogeneous survey with $griz$ band
measurements. We extract a final catalog of 573 unique Jupiter Trojans. Our
sample include 547 asteroids belonging to L5. This is one of the largest
analyzed samples for this group. By comparing with the data reported by other
surveys we found that the color distribution of L5 Trojans is similar to that
of L4 Trojans. We find that L5 Trojans' $g - i$ and $g - r$ colors become less
red with fainter absolute magnitudes, a trend also seen in L4 Trojans. Both the
L4 and L5 clouds consistently show such a color-size correlation over an
absolute magnitude range $11 < H < 18$. We also use DES colors to perform
taxonomic classifications. C and P-type asteroids outnumber D-type asteroids in
the L5 Trojans DES sample, which have diameters in the 5 - 20 km range. This is
consistent with the color-size correlation.

generic, and is therefore applicable to other systems. Simulations of the
temporal model (nonlinear parabolic system) reveal the presence of steady
states, often associated with energy dissipation. A Newton method based on a
mixed finite element method is provided, in order to directly evaluate the
steady states (nonlinear elliptic system) of the temporal system, and is
validated against its solutions. Linear stability analysis (LSA) using Fourier
analysis is carried out around homogeneous equilibria, and using spectral
analysis around non-homogeneous ones. For the latter, the spectral problem is
solved numerically. A multi-parameter bifurcation is reported. Original steady
state patterns are unveiled, not observable with linear diffusion only. Two key
observations are made: a dependency of the pattern with the initial condition
of the system, and a dependency on the geometry of the domain.

  MDL Principle","11 pages,16 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Load event detection is the fundamental step for the event-based
non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). However, existing event detection methods
with fixed parameters may fail in coping with the inherent multi-timescale
characteristics of events and their event detection accuracy is easily affected
by the load fluctuation. In this regard, this paper extends our previously
designed two-stage event detection framework, and proposes a novel
multi-timescale event detection method based on the principle of minimum
description length (MDL). Following the completion of step-like event detection
in the first stage, a long-transient event detection scheme with
variable-length sliding window is designed for the second stage, which is
intended to provide the observation and characterization of the same event at
different time scales. In that, the context information in the aggregated load
data is mined by motif discovery, and then based on the MDL principle, the
proper observation scales are selected for different events and the
corresponding detection results are determined. In the post-processing step, a
load fluctuation location method based on voice activity detection (VAD) is
proposed to identify and remove the unreasonable events caused by fluctuations.
Based on newly proposed evaluation metrics, the comparison tests on public and
private datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher detection accuracy
and integrity for events of various appliances across different scenarios.

characterization of the dynamic motion of vortices, a phase diagram of the
vortex ratchet motion is still missing, especially in the superconductors with
low dimensional structures. Here we establish a quantitative phase diagram of
the vortex ratchet motion in a highly anisotropic superlattice superconductor,
(SnS)1.17NbS2, using nonreciprocal magnetotransport. The (SnS)1.17NbS2, which
possesses a layered atomic structure and noncentrosymmetry, exhibits
nonreciprocal magnetotransport in a magnetic field perpendicular and parallel
to the plane, which is considered a manifest of ratchet motion of
superconducting vortices. We demonstrated that the ratchet motion is responsive
to current excitation, magnetic field and thermal perturbation. Furthermore, we
extrapolated a giant nonreciprocal coefficient ({\gamma}), which quantitatively
describes the magnitude of the vortex ratchet motion, and eventually
established phase diagrams of the ratchet motion of the vortices with a
quantitative description. Last, we propose that the ratchet motion originates
from the coexistence of pancake vortices (PVs) and Josephson vortices (JVs).
The phase diagrams are desirable for controlling the vortex motion in
superlattice superconductors and developing next-generation energy-efficient
superconducting devices.

the sequential, reusable, and sparsified nature of operations prevalent when

running individual processing threads on smaller data blocks, which is a
natural fit for the sequential, non-vectorized steps required to solve spiking

  Improving DNN Generalization and Robustness","Preprint",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators are prone to
non-idealities that degrade DNN performance at inference time. To mitigate such
degradation, existing methods typically add perturbations to the DNN weights
during training to simulate inference on noisy hardware. However, this often
requires knowledge about the target hardware and leads to a trade-off between
DNN performance and robustness, decreasing the former to increase the latter.
In this work, we show that applying sharpness-aware training, by optimizing for
both the loss value and loss sharpness, significantly improves robustness to
noisy hardware at inference time without relying on any assumptions about the
target hardware. In particular, we propose a new adaptive sharpness-aware
method that conditions the worst-case perturbation of a given weight not only
on its magnitude but also on the range of the weight distribution. This is
achieved by performing sharpness-aware minimization scaled by outlier
minimization (SAMSON). Our approach outperforms existing sharpness-aware
training methods both in terms of model generalization performance in noiseless
regimes and robustness in noisy settings, as measured on several architectures
and datasets.

  compressed mass spectra with the ATLAS detector at the LHC","PhD thesis",,,"CERN-THESIS-2022-161","hep-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Two analyses searching for the production of supersymmetric particles through
the electroweak interaction are presented: the chargino search, targeting the
pair production of charginos decaying into W bosons and neutralinos, and the
displaced track search, looking for charged tracks arising from the decays of
higgsinos into pions. These searches target compressed phase spaces, where the
mass difference between the next-to-lightest and lightest supersymmetric
particle is relatively small. The searches use proton-proton collision data
collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the
LHC. In the chargino search, the targeted mass difference between charginos and
neutralinos is close to the mass of the W boson. In such phase space, the
chargino pair production is kinematically similar to the WW background, making
the chargino signal experimentally challenging to be discriminated from the WW
background. Machine learning techniques are adopted to separate the
supersymmetric signal from the backgrounds. The results exclude chargino masses
up to about 140 GeV for mass splittings down to about 100 GeV, superseding the
previous results in particularly interesting regions where the chargino pair
production could have hidden behind the looking-alike WW background. In the
displaced track search, the mass difference between the produced sparticles and
the lightest neutralinos goes down to 0.3 GeV. The experimental signature has a
low momentum charged track with an origin displaced from the collision point.
The results show that the analysis has the sensitivity to exclude different
hypotheses for higgsino masses up to 175 GeV if no excess is observed in data.
For lower masses, the larger signal cross-section allows to achieve higher
significance for different mass splitting scenarios. All these signal
hypotheses have not been probed by any existing analysis of LHC data.

demonstrated tremendous potential for brain function analysis and brain disease
classification. Recently, studies have applied deep learning techniques (i.e.,
convolutional neural network, CNN) to dFCN classification, and achieved better
performance than the traditional machine learning methods. Nevertheless,
previous deep learning methods usually perform successive convolutional
operations on the input dFCNs to obtain high-order brain network aggregation
features, extracting them from each sliding window using a series split, which
may neglect non-linear correlations among different regions and the
sequentiality of information. Thus, important high-order sequence information
of dFCNs, which could further improve the classification performance, is
ignored in these studies. Nowadays, inspired by the great success of
Transformer in natural language processing and computer vision, some latest
work has also emerged on the application of Transformer for brain disease
diagnosis based on rs-fMRI data. Although Transformer is capable of capturing
non-linear correlations, it lacks accounting for capturing local spatial
feature patterns and modelling the temporal dimension due to parallel

adaptively excluded from the model training by sample weighting. Especially,
due to the pairwise relationship and a new balance regularization term, the

efficiently solve this nonconvex quadratic problem, we propose a doubly

theoretically prove the convergence not only for the doubly stochastic

Experimental results on several standard data sets demonstrate that our BSPML

tools in biomedical research, having been used together with ultrasound to
develop significant diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. It has been
suggested that the dynamic behaviour of microbubbles is dependent on the
surrounding fluid's ambient (hydrostatic) pressure, and the potential to
non-invasively determine blood pressure has numerous medical applications. To
study this dependence, a computational mathematical model was created based on
Marmottant's dynamic model of a microbubble. A pulse inversion (PI) protocol
was incorporated into the model to emphasize the nonlinear behaviour of the
microbubble's response. The mathematical model was also used to assess the
sensitivity of the microbubbles to undesirable changes in parameters other than
the ambient pressure. It found that a variation in the microbubble's initial
radius and surface tension would cause the most significant changes in signal
energy and hence pose a risk to ambient pressure measurements. To test the
practicality of detecting a change in the dynamic behaviour of microbubbles, in
vitro experiments were designed and carried out using clinically available
contrast agent with two different ultrasound systems. The experiments, while
possessing certain limitations, confirmed that there is a change in
microbubbles' dynamic behaviour when the ambient pressure is varied, in cases
by as little as 7.36 mmHg (981 Pa - a 0.98% change in atmospheric pressure).
The experimental results establish a proof-of-principle that future
experimental work can build upon to verify the mathematical model, and hence
aid in developing a non-invasive blood pressure measurement procedure.

compositional state-object embedding or predict simple primitives with separate

methods, and the latter ignores the interactions of interdependent primitives,
respectively. In this paper, we revisit the primitive prediction approach and
propose a novel method, termed Progressive Cross-primitive Compatibility
(ProCC), to mimic the human learning process for OW-CZSL tasks. Specifically,
the cross-primitive compatibility module explicitly learns to model the
interactions of state and object features with the trainable memory units,
which efficiently acquires cross-primitive visual attention to reason
high-feasibility compositions, without the aid of external knowledge. Moreover,
considering the partial-supervision setting (pCZSL) as well as the imbalance

component of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with official estimates
showing that it likely accounted for a quarter of total global production.
While evidence of association already exists in macro-economic data between
trade volume and GDP growth, there is considerably less work on whether, at the
level of individual granular sectors (such as vehicles or minerals),
associations exist between the complexity of trading networks and global GDP.
In this paper, we explore this question by using publicly available data from
the Atlas of Economic Complexity project to rigorously construct global trade
networks between nations across multiple sectors, and studying the correlation
between network-theoretic measures computed on these networks (such as average
clustering coefficient and density) and global GDP. We find that there is
indeed significant association between trade networks' complexity and global
GDP across almost every sector, and that network metrics also correlate with
business cycle phenomena such as the Great Recession of 2007-2008. Our results
show that trade volume alone cannot explain global GDP growth, and that network
science may prove to be a valuable empirical avenue for studying complexity in
macro-economic phenomena such as trade.

required for EEG based sleep staging. Additionally, the EEG setup being
obtrusive in nature and requiring an expert for setup adds to the inconvenience
of the subject under study, making it adverse in the point of care setting. An
unobtrusive and more suitable alternative to EEG is Electrocardiogram (ECG).
Unsurprisingly, compared to EEG in sleep staging, its performance remains
sub-par. In order to take advantage of both the modalities, transferring
knowledge from EEG to ECG is a reasonable approach, ultimately boosting the
performance of ECG based sleep staging. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a
promising notion in DL that shares knowledge from a superior performing but
usually more complex teacher model to an inferior but compact student model.
Building upon this concept, a cross-modality KD framework assisting features
learned through models trained on EEG to improve ECG-based sleep staging
performance is proposed. Additionally, to better understand the distillation
approach, extensive experimentation on the independent modules of the proposed

specify the Universe's thermal history and that a quintom regime can be
encountered. For open and closed both the cases, we find the expressions for
the deceleration parameter and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. Also, by
varying the associated parameters, classical stability of the method is
established. On considering the curvature to be positive, the universe favors
the quintom behavior for substantially smaller values as opposed to the flat

spaces are considered. Concepts of CF-approximation spaces and CF-closed sets
are introduced. It is proved that the family of CF-closed sets in a
CF-approximation space endowed with set-inclusion order is a continuous domain
and that every continuous domain is isomorphic to the family of CF-closed sets
of some CF-approximation space endowed with set-inclusion order. The concept of
CF-approximable relations is introduced using a categorical approach, which
later facilitates the proof that the category of CF-approximation spaces and
CF-approximable relations is equivalent to that of continuous domains and Scott
continuous maps.

  Constrained Generative Models","NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Human Evaluation of Generative Models",,,,"cs.HC cs.CL cs.CV cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we present some recommendations on the evaluation of
state-of-the-art generative models for constrained generation tasks. The
progress on generative models has been rapid in recent years. These large-scale
models have had three impacts: firstly, the fluency of generation in both
language and vision modalities has rendered common average-case evaluation
metrics much less useful in diagnosing system errors. Secondly, the same
substrate models now form the basis of a number of applications, driven both by
the utility of their representations as well as phenomena such as in-context
learning, which raise the abstraction level of interacting with such models.
Thirdly, the user expectations around these models and their feted public
releases have made the technical challenge of out of domain generalization much
less excusable in practice. Subsequently, our evaluation methodologies haven't
adapted to these changes. More concretely, while the associated utility and
methods of interacting with generative models have expanded, a similar
expansion has not been observed in their evaluation practices. In this paper,
we argue that the scale of generative models could be exploited to raise the
abstraction level at which evaluation itself is conducted and provide
recommendations for the same. Our recommendations are based on leveraging
specifications as a powerful instrument to evaluate generation quality and are
readily applicable to a variety of tasks.

  Crowdsourcing",,,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the noises in crowdsourced labels, label aggregation (LA) has emerged
as a standard procedure to post-process crowdsourced labels. LA methods
estimate true labels from crowdsourced labels by modeling worker qualities.
Most existing LA methods are iterative in nature. They need to traverse all the
crowdsourced labels multiple times in order to jointly and iteratively update
true labels and worker qualities until convergence. Consequently, these methods
have high space and time complexities. In this paper, we treat LA as a dynamic
system and model it as a Dynamic Bayesian network. From the dynamic model we
derive two light-weight algorithms, LA\textsuperscript{onepass} and
LA\textsuperscript{twopass}, which can effectively and efficiently estimate
worker qualities and true labels by traversing all the labels at most twice.
Due to the dynamic nature, the proposed algorithms can also estimate true
labels online without re-visiting historical data. We theoretically prove the
convergence property of the proposed algorithms, and bound the error of
estimated worker qualities. We also analyze the space and time complexities of
the proposed algorithms and show that they are equivalent to those of majority
voting. Experiments conducted on 20 real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms can effectively and efficiently aggregate labels in both
offline and online settings even if they traverse all the labels at most twice.

Colony scheme is coupled with a local search procedure and provides high

solutions as profitable as CARPET ones can be obtained using such scheme when a
sufficient number of iterations is devoted to the ants. It competes with the
Genetic Algorithm of Lacomme et al. regarding solution quality but it is more
time consuming on large scale instances. The method has been intensively
benchmarked on the well-known instances of Eglese, DeArmon and the last ones of

GW-calorimetry and event timing, applied to a post-merger descending chirp
which can potentially break the degeneracy in spin-down of a neutron star or
black hole remnant by the relatively large energy reservoir in the angular
momentum, $E_J$, of the latter according to the Kerr metric. This analysis
derives from model-agnostic spectrograms with equal sensitivity to ascending
and descending chirps generated by time-symmetric butterfly matched filtering.
The sensitivity was calibrated by response curves generated by software
injection experiments. The statistical significance for candidate emission from
the central engine of GRB170817A is expressed by probabilities of false alarm
(PFA; type I errors) derived from an event-timing analysis. PDFs were derived
for start-time $t_s$, identified via high-resolution image analyses of the
available spectrograms. For merged (H1,L1)-spectrograms of the LIGO detectors,
a PFA $p_1$ derives from causality in $t_s$ given GW170817-GRB17081A. A
statistically independent confirmation is presented in individual H1 and L1
analyses, in a second PFA $p_2$ of consistency in their respective observations
of $t_s$. A combined PFA derives from their product since mean and
(respectively) difference in timing are statistically independent. Applied to
GW170817-GRB170817A, PFAs of event timing in $t_s$ produce $p_1=8.3\times
10^{-4}$ and $p_2=4.9\times 10^{-5}$ of a post-merger output ${\cal
E}_{GW}\simeq 3.5\%M_\odot c^2$ ($p_1p_2=4.1\times 10^{-8}$, equivalent
$Z$-score 5.48). ${\cal E}_{GW}$ exceeds $E_J$ of the hyper-massive neutron
star in the immediate aftermath of GW170817, yet it is consistent with $E_J$
rejuvenated in delayed gravitational collapse to a Kerr black hole. Similar
emission may be expected from energetic core-collapse supernovae producing
black holes. (Abbr.)

compared. It is found that the NUFFT is comparable to interpolation in spectral
profile shape and spectral noise levels and is better in spectral amplitude and
computer performance. A significant advantage is also found in the case of
under-sampling and noise performance by NUFFT due to the unique non-periodic
nature of non-uniform sampling. In addition, a novel implementation of NUFFT is

different regulation regimes and three different sets of listing day trading
restrictions. This paper studies the impact of regulation regimes and listing
day trading restrictions on the initial return of ChiNext IPOs. We hypothesize
that the initial return of a ChiNext IPO contains the issuers intrinsic value
and the investors overreaction. The intrinsic value is represented by the IPOs
21st day return (monthly return), and the difference between the monthly and
initial returns (intramonth return) is a proxy of the overreaction. We find
that all significant variables for all three returns in all three time periods
fall into four categories: pre-listing demand, post-listing demand, market
condition and pre-listing issuer value. We observe stark contrasts among
variable categories for each of the returns in the three time periods, which
reveals an evolution of the investors behavior with regard to the progression
of regulation regimes. Based on our findings, we argue that the differences
among the levels and determinants of initial return, monthly return (intrinsic
value) and intramonth return (overreaction) in different time periods can be
largely explained by regulation regime changes along two dimensions: 1)
approval vs. registration and 2) listing day trading curbs and return limits.
We find that IPO pricing is demand-driven under the approval regime, but
value-driven under the registration regime. We further compare the impact of
regulation regime changes on ChiNext IPO pricing practice, and propose a future
research plan on ChiNext IPO pricing efficiency with policy implication.

been monitoring the sky for evidence of remotely detectable technological life
beyond Earth, with no positive results to date. While the lack of detection can
be attributed to the highly incomplete sampling of the search space,
technological emissions may be actually rare enough that we are living in a
time when none cross the Earth. Here we explore the latter possibility and
derive the likelihood of the Earth not being crossed by signals for at least
the last 60 years to infer upper bounds on their rate of emission. Under the
assumption that technological emitters are distributed uniformly in the Milky
Way and that they generate technoemissions at a constant rate, we find less
than about one to five emissions generated per century with 95% credible level.
This implies optimistic waiting times until the next crossing event of no less
than 60-1800 years with a 50% probability. A significant fraction of highly
directional signals increases the emission rates upper bounds, but without
systematically changing the waiting time. Although these probabilistic bounds
are derived from a specific model and their validity depends on the model's
assumptions, they are nevertheless quite robust against weak time dependences
of the emission rate or nonuniform spatial distributions of the emitters. Our
results provide therefore a benchmark for assessing the lack of detection and
may serve as a basis to form optimal strategies for the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence.

is the end of economic activity, because the ultimate aim of other economic
activities is to meet consumer demand; consumer activity is the starting point
of economic activity, because consumption can drive economic and social
development. This paper selects the economic data of more than 40 years since

level and total consumption of urban and rural residents on economic growth.
