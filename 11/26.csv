obtained by adding a potential function of the form $C1_{\mathcal{A}}$, where
$C$ is a real valued constant and $1_{\mathcal{A}}$ is the indicator function
of an open subset $\mathcal{A}$ of the billiard table whose boundaries (of
$\mathcal{A}$ and the table) are piecewise smooth. Trajectories are polygonal
lines that undergo either reflection or refraction at the boundary of
$\mathcal{A}$ depending on the angle of incidence. After laying out some basic
concepts and general facts, in particular reviewing the optical/mechanical
analogy that motivates these billiard models, we explore how their dynamical
properties depend on the potential parameter $C$ using a number of families of
examples. In particular, we explore numerically the Lyapunov exponents for
these parametric families and highlight the more salient common properties that
distinguish them from standard billiard systems. We further justify some of
these properties by characterizing lensed billiards in terms of switching
dynamics between two open (standard) billiard subsystems and obtaining mean
values associated to orbit sojourn in each subsystem.

accelerators. In the presence of energetic protons in a GRB jet, interactions
between these protons and intense radiation field of the GRB are supposed to
induce electromagnetic cascade. Electrons/positrons generated in the cascade
will produce an additional spectrum of robust feature, which is in the form of
a power-law distribution up to GeV regime with an index of $\lesssim 2$. We
suggest that measurements of Fermi-LAT at GeV band can provide independent
constraints on the key GRB model parameters such as the dissipation radius, the
jet's bulk Lorentz factor, and the baryon loading factor. Taking GRB 221009A,
the brightest GRB ever detected, as an example, we show that the constraints

solutions, and they display a very fast convergence. Even if this class of
methods has been widely researched and studied in the numerical linear algebra
community, its use in applied medical physics and applied engineering is still
very limited. e.g. in realistic large-scale Computed Tomography (CT) problems,

evolutionary perspective they focus on two fundamental mechanisms: cultural
inheritance in Swarm Intelligence and genetic inheritance in Evolutionary
Algorithms. Contemporary evolutionary biology looks beyond genetic inheritance,
proposing a so-called ``Extended Evolutionary Synthesis''. Many concepts from
the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis have been left out of Evolutionary
Computation as interest has moved toward specific implementations of the same
general mechanisms. One such concept is epigenetic inheritance, which is
increasingly considered central to evolutionary thinking. Epigenetic mechanisms
allow quick non- or partially-genetic adaptations to environmental changes.
Dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems represent similar circumstances
to the natural world where fitness can be determined by multiple objectives
(traits), and the environment is constantly changing.
  This paper asks if the advantages that epigenetic inheritance provide in the
natural world are replicated in dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems.
Specifically, an epigenetic blocking mechanism is applied to a state-of-the-art
multi-objective genetic algorithm, MOEA/D-DE, and its performance is compared
on three sets of dynamic test functions, FDA, JY, and UDF. The mechanism shows
improved performance on 12 of the 16 test problems, providing initial evidence
that more algorithms should explore the wealth of epigenetic mechanisms seen in
the natural world.

continuing in Lake Baikal. By April 2022, ten clusters of the telescope were
put into operation, with 2880 optical modules in total. One of the relevant
tasks in this context is to study the possibilities of increasing the
efficiency of the detector based on the experience of its operation and the
results obtained at other neutrino telescopes in recent years. In this paper, a
variant of optimizing the configuration of the telescope is considered, based
on the installation of additional strings of optical modules between the
clusters (external strings). An experimental version of the external string was
installed in Lake Baikal in April 2022. This paper presents a first estimate of
the impact of adding external strings on the neutrino detection efficiency, as
well as the technical implementation of the detection and data acquisition
systems of the external string and first results of its in-situ tests.

begins with the discussion of single flexible or semiflexible linear polymer
chains subjected to two noises, thermal and active. The active noise has either
Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution but has a memory, accounting for the
persistent motion of the active bath particles. This finite persistence makes
the reconfiguration dynamics of the chain slow as compared to the purely
thermal case and the chain swells. The active noise also results superdiffusive
or ballistic motion of the tagged monomer. We present all the calculations in
details but mainly focus on the analytically exact or almost exact results on
the topic, as obtained from our group in recent years. In addition, we briefly
mention important works of other groups and include some of our new results.
The review concludes with pointing out the implications of polymer chains in

extract co-spatial and co-moving stellar populations from large-scale surveys
such as ESA Gaia. The method studies the topological properties of the density
field in the multidimensional phase space. We validate SigMA on simulated
clusters and find that it outperforms competing methods, especially in cases
where many clusters are closely spaced. We apply the new method to Gaia DR3
data of the closest OB association to Earth, Scorpio-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), and
find more than 13,000 co-moving young objects, with about 19% of these having a
sub-stellar mass. SigMA finds 37 co-moving clusters in Sco-Cen. These clusters
are independently validated by their narrow HRD sequences and, to a certain
extent, by their association with massive stars too bright for Gaia, hence
unknown to SigMA. We compare our results with similar recent work and find that
the SigMA algorithm recovers richer populations, is able to distinguish
clusters with velocity differences down to about 0.5 km s$^{-1}$, and reaches
cluster volume densities as low as 0.01 sources/pc$^3$. The 3D distribution of
these 37 coeval clusters implies a larger extent and volume for the Sco-Cen OB
association than typically assumed in the literature. Additionally, we find the
association to be more actively star-forming and dynamically more complex than
previously thought. We confirm that the star-forming molecular clouds in the
Sco-Cen region, namely, Ophiuchus, L134/L183, Pipe Nebula, Corona Australis,
Lupus, and Chamaeleon, are part of the Sco-Cen The application of SigMA to
Sco-Cen demonstrates that advanced machine learning tools applied to the superb
Gaia data allows to construct an accurate census of the young populations, to
quantify their dynamics, and to reconstruct the recent star formation history

technique for micro-organism detection, reaching detection limits similar to
those obtained using culture-based methods, while keeping a high accuracy,
remains challenging due to weak bacterial Raman signals. Taking advantage of
the unique electromagnetic properties of metamaterials, we demonstrate
bacterial identification in liquid using an array of Fano-resonant
metamolecules that act as an enhanced Raman scattering (FERS) platform. The
metamaterial is designed to exhibit a Fano resonance close to the protein amide
group fingerprint regions. Under the off-resonance condition, Raman signatures
of Escherichia coli were recorded at several locations on the metamaterial. We
observe that the intensity of the amide characteristic peaks increases during
the bacteria exponential phase while it decreases at their stationary phase.
This study provides a new set of opportunities for developing ultrasensitive
FERS platforms suitable for large-scale applications and will be particularly
useful for diagnostics and environmental studies.

they are already widely applied in various machine learning applications.
State-of-art deep neural networks are becoming larger in size every year to
deliver increasing model accuracy, and as a result, model training consumes
substantial computing resources and will only consume more in the future. Using
current training methods, in each iteration, to process a data point $x \in
\mathbb{R}^d$ in a layer, we need to spend $\Theta(md)$ time to evaluate all
the $m$ neurons in the layer. This means processing the entire layer takes
$\Theta(nmd)$ time for $n$ data points. Recent work [Song, Yang and Zhang,
NeurIPS 2021] reduces this time per iteration to $o(nmd)$, but requires
exponential time to preprocess either the data or the neural network weights,
making it unlikely to have practical usage.
  In this work, we present a new preprocessing method that simply stores the
weight-data correlation in a tree data structure in order to quickly,
dynamically detect which neurons fire at each iteration. Our method requires
only $O(nmd)$ time in preprocessing and still achieves $o(nmd)$ time per
iteration. We complement our new algorithm with a lower bound, proving that
assuming a popular conjecture from complexity theory, one could not
substantially speed up our algorithm for dynamic detection of firing neurons.

previous research has explored designing specific exercises relying on
providing semantic and linguistic cues to help formulate such questions. But
despite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited as it
relies on generating the said cues by hand, which can be a very costly process.
In this context, we propose to leverage advances in the natural language
processing field (NLP) and investigate the efficiency of using a large language
model (LLM) for automating the production of the pedagogical content of a
curious question-asking (QA) training. We study generating the said content
using the ""prompt-based"" method that consists of explaining the task to the LLM
in natural text. We evaluate the output using human experts annotations and
comparisons with hand-generated content. Results suggested indeed the relevance
and usefulness of this content. We also conduct a field study in primary school
(75 children aged 9-10), where we evaluate children's QA performance when
having this training. We compare 3 types of content : 1) hand-generated content
that proposes ""closed"" cues leading to predefined questions; 2) GPT-3-generated
content that proposes the same type of cues; 3) GPT-3-generated content that
proposes ""open"" cues leading to several possible questions. We see a similar QA
performance between the two ""closed"" trainings (showing the scalability of the
approach using GPT-3), and a better one for participants with the ""open""
training. These results suggest the efficiency of using LLMs to support
children in generating more curious questions, using a natural language
prompting approach that affords usability by teachers and other users not
specialists of AI techniques. Furthermore, results also show that open-ended
content may be more suitable for training curious question-asking skills.

the spatially separated measurement devices, severely limit the distances over
which nonlocal quantum correlations can be sustained in state-of-the-art Bell
experiments. Instead of looking for quantum strategies with marginally lower
threshold requirements, we exploit the properties of loophole-free nonlocal
correlations, which are experimentally attainable today, albeit at short
distances, to extend them over arbitrarily large distances. Specifically, we
consider Bell experiments wherein the spatially separated parties randomly
choose the location of their measurement devices in addition to their
measurement settings. We demonstrate that when devices close to the source are
perfect and witness extremal loophole-free nonlocal correlations, such
correlations can be extended to devices with almost-zero detection efficiency
and visibility placed arbitrarily far from the source. We then derive an
analytic trade-off specific to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality:
the higher the loophole-free nonlocality close to the source, the lower the
threshold requirements away from the source. We utilize this trade-off and
optimal quantum strategies to estimate the critical requirements of a
measurement device placed away from the source. Finally, we formulate a
versatile numerical method utilizing certifiable randomness to measure the
nonlocal behaviour of individual measurement devices and estimate their
critical parameters in generic network scenarios entailing several spatially
separated measurement devices.

principal observes the outcomes of each unit, after which the principal uses
these observations to assign a treatment to each unit. Unlike this classical
setting, we permit the units generating the panel data to be strategic, i.e.
units may modify their pre-intervention outcomes in order to receive a more

intervention policy, i.e. a policy that assigns units to their correct
interventions despite their potential strategizing. We first identify a
necessary and sufficient condition under which a strategyproof intervention
policy exists, and provide a strategyproof mechanism with a simple closed form
when one does exist. Along the way, we prove impossibility results for
strategic multiclass classification, which may be of independent interest. When

follows the behavior familiar in glass forming systems but the saturation at

mechanism of this unexpected behavior of viscosity, we perform extensive

transitions between surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators.
The photocurrent governed by the orientation of the polarization plane of light

is calculated. It is shown that both the shift contribution caused by
coordinate shifts of the particle wavepackets during the optical transitions
and the ballistic contribution caused by interference of the optical absorption
and scattering by disorder have generally the same order of magnitude. The
ballistic contribution is present owing to electron-hole asymmetry of
topological surface states and has a frequency dependence in contrast to the
shift photocurrent. In the nonlinear in the light intensity regime appearing
due to saturation of the direct optical transitions the ballistic contribution
dominates. The nontrivial dependence of the photocurrent on the polarization

Transformer has a larger receptive field which is capable of characterizing the
long-range dependencies. Nevertheless, the large receptive field of Vision
Transformer is accompanied by the huge computational cost. To boost efficiency,
the window-based Vision Transformers emerge. They crop an image into several
local windows, and the self-attention is conducted within each window. To bring
back the global receptive field, window-based Vision Transformers have devoted
a lot of efforts to achieving cross-window communications by developing several
sophisticated operations. In this work, we check the necessity of the key
design element of Swin Transformer, the shifted window partitioning. We
discover that a simple depthwise convolution is sufficient for achieving
effective cross-window communications. Specifically, with the existence of the
depthwise convolution, the shifted window configuration in Swin Transformer
cannot lead to an additional performance improvement. Thus, we degenerate the
Swin Transformer to a plain Window-based (Win) Transformer by discarding
sophisticated shifted window partitioning. The proposed Win Transformer is
conceptually simpler and easier for implementation than Swin Transformer.
Meanwhile, our Win Transformer achieves consistently superior performance than
Swin Transformer on multiple computer vision tasks, including image

and calculating directly the scattered fields through the Method of Moments,
the near-field and far-field response of the metasurface can be accurately
predicted and optimized. In particular, a design example of a modulated
dielectric metasurface, fed by a single embedded line source, is presented for
the realization of a Chebyshev array pattern with -20 dB sidelobe level.
Moreover, an externally-fed dielectric metasurface performing beam splitting of
a normally-incident plane wave is designed, 3-D printed and measured, showing
two reflected beams at +-30 degrees, high suppression of specular reflections

compute HEE for strip-shaped subsystems in boundary dimensions d=2,3,4, which
provides us with general qualitative inferences on the interplay between fluid
flows and entanglement dynamics. At first, we consider the zeroth order in
hydrodynamic derivative expansion, holographically described by stationary
boosted black branes. Working non-perturbatively in fluid velocity, we find
that, as the fluid velocity approaches its relativistic upper limit, the UV
regulated HEE exhibits a divergence, at arbitrary temperature. Also, the
holographic mutual information between two relatively close subsystems vanishes
at some critical fluid velocity and remains zero beyond it. We then compute HEE
in an excited state of the fluid in the presence of a sound mode, considering
first order in derivative expansion. As a simplified setup, we first work with
non-dissipative dynamics in $d=2$, where the time evolution of HEE is studied
in the presence of the sound mode and a propagating pressure pulse. In d= 4, we
find that dissipative sound modes produce an additional dynamical UV divergence
which is subleading compared to `area law divergence'. No such divergence is
observed for dissipative sound mode in d=3.

conductivity of the whole solar cell and its conversion efficiency. This work
evaluates different epitaxial growth strategies to achieve control on the Zn
profile of an inverted metamorphic triple-junction structure, including: the
reduction of the doping concentration in the tunnel junction to minimize the
injection of point defects that trigger the diffusion mechanism; the use of
different barrier layers to keep the injected point defects away from active
layers and, finally, the minimization of Zn concentration in the AlGaInP
back-surface-field layer of the GaInP subcell. This last approach enables a
high-conductivity multijunction solar cell device without redesigning the
tunnel junction as well as a high electronic quality in the GaInP subcell,
which shows a collection efficiency higher than 93% and an open-circuit-voltage
offset of 410 mV at 1 sun irradiance. The characterization of final
triple-junction devices, including quantum efficiency, electroluminescence, and
light current-density-voltage curves at different irradiances, demonstrates a
successful integration of all the subcell and tunnel junction components. This

represent one of the greatest challenge for the mission. Currently, in the LISA
Datacode Challenge, each galactic binary is modeled as a quasi-monochromatic

the 2.5 post-Newtonian approximation. If this picture is expected to be an
accurate description for most of the galactic binaries that LSIA will detect,

properties beyond the point-mass approximation. In this work, we investigate
how a binary system of highly magnetic objects in quasi-circular orbit could
affect the quasi-monochromatic picture of the GW signal detected by LISA. We
demonstrate that the eccentricity generates additional frequency peaks at
harmonics of the mean motion and that magnetism is responsible for shifting

classical diodes. The superconducting diode effect relies on the breaking of
both time-reversal and inversion symmetry. As a result, the critical current of
a superconductor can become dependent on the direction of the applied current.
The combination of these ingredients naturally occurs in proximitized
semiconductors under a magnetic field, which is also predicted to give rise to
exotic physics such as topological superconductivity. In this work, we use InSb
nanowires proximitized by Al to investigate the superconducting diode effect.
Through shadow-wall lithography, we create short Josephson junctions with gate
control of both the semiconducting weak link as well as the proximitized leads.
When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the nanowire axis, the
superconducting diode effect depends on the out-of-plane angle. In particular,
it is strongest along a specific angle, which we interpret as the direction of
the spin-orbit field in the proximitized leads. Moreover, the electrostatic
gates can be used to drastically alter this effect and even completely suppress
it. Finally, we also observe a significant gate-tunable diode effect when the
magnetic field is applied parallel to the nanowire axis. Due to the
considerable degree of control via electrostatic gating, the

in the construction of fast preconditioners for more complicated problems. In
this work we present multigrid solvers for high-order finite element
discretizations of these Riesz maps with the same time and space complexity as
sum-factorized operator application, i.e.~with optimal complexity in polynomial
degree in the context of Krylov methods. The key idea of our approach is to
build new finite elements for each space in the de Rham complex with
orthogonality properties in both the $L^2$- and $H(\mathrm{d})$-inner products
($\mathrm{d} \in \{\mathrm{grad}, \mathrm{curl}, \mathrm{div}\})$ on the
reference hexahedron. The resulting sparsity enables the fast solution of the
patch problems arising in the Pavarino, Arnold--Falk--Winther and Hiptmair
space decompositions, in the separable case. In the non-separable case, the
method can be applied to an auxiliary operator that is sparse by construction.
With exact Cholesky factorizations of the sparse patch problems, the
application complexity is optimal but the setup costs and storage are not. We
overcome this with the finer Hiptmair space decomposition and the use of
incomplete Cholesky factorizations imposing the sparsity pattern arising from
static condensation, which applies whether static condensation is used for the

continuity interpolating along the whole spatial surface for different time

Spatio-temporal interpolation ignoring the dynamic behavior of a spatial mean
function, threshold distance, and direction of maintaining spatial continuity.
Therefore, we employ hierarchical spatial clustering (HSC) to preserve local
spatial stationarity. This research work introduces a hybrid extreme valued
copula-based Spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm. Spatial dependence is
captured by a blended extreme valued probability distribution (BEVD). Temporal
dependency is modeled by the Bi-directional long short-time memory (BLSTM) at
different temporal granularities, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months.
Spatio-temporal dependence is modeled by the Gumbel-Hougaard copula (GH). We
apply the proposed Spatio-temporal interpolation approach to the air pollution
data (Outdoor Particulate Matter (PM) concentration) of Delhi, collected from
the website of the Central Pollution Control Board, India as a crucial
circumstantial study. This article describes a probabilistic-recurrent neural
networking algorithm for Spatio-temporal interpolation. This Spatio-temporal
hybrid copula interpolation algorithm outperforms and is efficient enough to
detect spatial trends and temporal influence. From the entire research, we
notice that PM concentration in a year reaches a maximum, generally in November

diverse output images from the same input image despite only one output image

IMLE uses the same generator as GANs but trains it with a different,

this paper, we propose a new method to get around this limitation, which we dub
Conditional Hierarchical IMLE (CHIMLE), which can generate high-fidelity images

provided their luminosity is standardized by applying empirical corrections
based on light-curve properties. One factor behind these corrections is dust
extinction, accounted for in the color-luminosity relation of the
standardization. This relation is usually assumed to be universal, which could
potentially introduce systematics into the standardization. The ``mass-step''
observed for SNe Ia Hubble residuals has been suggested as one such systematic.
We seek to obtain a completer view of dust attenuation properties for a sample
of 162 SN Ia host galaxies and to probe their link to the ``mass-step''. We
infer attenuation laws towards hosts from both global and local (4 kpc) Dark
Energy Survey photometry and Composite Stellar Population model fits. We
recover a optical depth/attenuation slope relation, best explained by differing
star/dust geometry for different galaxy orientations, which is significantly
different from the optical depth/extinction slope relation observed directly
for SNe. We obtain a large variation of attenuation slopes and confirm these
change with host properties, like stellar mass and age, meaning a universal SN
Ia correction should ideally not be assumed. Analyzing the cosmological
standardization, we find evidence for a ``mass-step'' and a two dimensional
``dust-step'', both more pronounced for red SNe. Although comparable, the two
steps are found no to be completely analogous. We conclude that host galaxy
dust data cannot fully account for the ``mass-step'', using either an
alternative SN standardization with extinction proxied by host attenuation or a
``dust-step'' approach.

communication cost between the clients and the central server can often be a
bottleneck. To reduce the communication cost, the paradigm of communication
compression has become a popular strategy in the literature. In this paper, we
focus on biased gradient compression techniques in non-convex FL problems. In
the classical setting of distributed learning, the method of error feedback
(EF) is a common technique to remedy the downsides of biased gradient
compression. In this work, we study a compressed FL scheme equipped with error
feedback, named Fed-EF. We further propose two variants: Fed-EF-SGD and
Fed-EF-AMS, depending on the choice of the global model optimizer. We provide a
generic theoretical analysis, which shows that directly applying biased
compression in FL leads to a non-vanishing bias in the convergence rate. The
proposed Fed-EF is able to match the convergence rate of the full-precision FL
counterparts under data heterogeneity with a linear speedup.
  Moreover, we develop a new analysis of the EF under partial client
participation, which is an important scenario in FL. We prove that under
partial participation, the convergence rate of Fed-EF exhibits an extra
slow-down factor due to a so-called ``stale error compensation'' effect. A
numerical study is conducted to justify the intuitive impact of stale error
accumulation on the norm convergence of Fed-EF under partial participation.
Finally, we also demonstrate that incorporating the two-way compression in
Fed-EF does not change the convergence results. In summary, our work conducts a
thorough analysis of the error feedback in federated non-convex optimization.
Our analysis with partial client participation also provides insights on a
theoretical limitation of the error feedback mechanism, and possible directions
for improvements.

Based on this finding, we propose a novel outlier scoring function called RbA
by defining the event of being an outlier as being rejected by all known

performance of the existing outlier detection methods, and the best results are

predictable (i.e. higher surprisal) words take more time to read. In general,
these previous studies implicitly assumed the reading process to be purely
responsive: readers observe a new word and allocate time to read it as
required. These results, however, are also compatible with a reading time that
is anticipatory: readers could, e.g., allocate time to a future word based on
their expectation about it. In this work, we examine the anticipatory nature of
reading by looking at how people's predictions about upcoming material
influence reading times. Specifically, we test anticipation by looking at the
effects of surprisal and contextual entropy on four reading-time datasets: two
self-paced and two eye-tracking. In three of four datasets tested, we find that
the entropy predicts reading times as well as (or better than) the surprisal.
We then hypothesise four cognitive mechanisms through which the contextual
entropy could impact RTs -- three of which we design experiments to analyse.
Overall, our results support a view of reading that is both anticipatory and

  https://barquerogerman.github.io/BeLFusion/",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Stochastic human motion prediction (HMP) has generally been tackled with
generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders. Most prior works
aim at predicting highly diverse movements in terms of the skeleton joints'
dispersion. This has led to methods predicting fast and motion-divergent
movements, which are often unrealistic and incoherent with past motion. Such
methods also neglect contexts that need to anticipate diverse low-range
behaviors, or actions, with subtle joint displacements. To address these
issues, we present BeLFusion, a model that, for the first time, leverages
latent diffusion models in HMP to sample from a latent space where behavior is
disentangled from pose and motion. As a result, diversity is encouraged from a
behavioral perspective. Thanks to our behavior coupler's ability to transfer
sampled behavior to ongoing motion, BeLFusion's predictions display a variety
of behaviors that are significantly more realistic than the state of the art.
To support it, we introduce two metrics, the Area of the Cumulative Motion
Distribution, and the Average Pairwise Distance Error, which are correlated to
our definition of realism according to a qualitative study with 126
participants. Finally, we prove BeLFusion's generalization power in a new
cross-dataset scenario for stochastic HMP.

challenge in computer vision. Recently popularized approaches based on neural
scene representations have achieved tremendous impact and have been applied
across a variety of applications. One of the major remaining challenges in this
space is training a single model which can provide latent representations which
effectively generalize beyond a single scene. Scene Representation Transformer
(SRT) has shown promise in this direction, but scaling it to a larger set of
diverse scenes is challenging and necessitates accurately posed ground truth
data. To address this problem, we propose RUST (Really Unposed Scene
representation Transformer), a pose-free approach to novel view synthesis
trained on RGB images alone. Our main insight is that one can train a Pose
Encoder that peeks at the target image and learns a latent pose embedding which
is used by the decoder for view synthesis. We perform an empirical
investigation into the learned latent pose structure and show that it allows
meaningful test-time camera transformations and accurate explicit pose
readouts. Perhaps surprisingly, RUST achieves similar quality as methods which
have access to perfect camera pose, thereby unlocking the potential for
large-scale training of amortized neural scene representations.

regions, from some unknown distribution given only a set of positive (good)

of normal examples. Recent embedding-based methods, that compare the embedding
vectors of queries to a set of reference embeddings, have demonstrated
impressive results for FSAD, where as little as one good example is provided. A
different approach, image-reconstruction-based, has been historically used for
AD. The idea is to train a model to recover normal images from corrupted
observations, assuming that the model will fail to recover regions when
encountered with an out-of-distribution image. However,
image-reconstruction-based methods were not yet used in the low-shot regime as
they need to be trained on a diverse set of normal images in order to properly
perform. We suggest using Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE), a self-supervised
transformer model trained for recovering missing image regions based on their
surroundings for FSAD. We show that MAE performs well by pre-training on an
arbitrary set of natural images (ImageNet) and only fine-tuning on a small set
of normal images. We name this method MAEDAY. We further find that MAEDAY
provides an orthogonal signal to the embedding-based methods and the ensemble
of the two approaches achieves very strong SOTA results. We also present a
novel task of Zero-Shot AD (ZSAD) where no normal samples are available at

Finally, we provide a new dataset for detecting foreign objects on the ground

probability of gravitational encounters among stellar systems during the early

hyperbolic or parabolic passages (a so-called 'fly-by'), through secular binary
evolution, or through binary capture. In all three scenarios, the strong
gravitational perturbation is expected to manifest itself in the disc
structures around the individual stars. Here, we present near-infrared
polarised light observations that were taken with the SPHERE/IRDIS instrument
of three known interacting twin-disc systems: AS 205, EM* SR 24, and FU
Orionis. The scattered light exposes spirals likely caused by the gravitational
interaction. On a larger scale, we observe connecting filaments between the
stars. We analyse their very complex polarised intensity and put particular
attention to the presence of multiple light sources in these systems. The local
angle of linear polarisation indicates the source whose light dominates the
scattering process from the bridging region between the two stars. Further, we
show that the polarised intensity from scattering with multiple relevant light
sources results from an incoherent summation of the individuals' contribution.
This can produce nulls of polarised intensity in an image, as potentially
observed in AS 205. We discuss the geometry and content of the systems by
comparing the polarised light observations with other data at similar
resolution, namely with ALMA continuum and gas emission. Collective
observational data can constrain the systems' geometry and stellar
trajectories, with the important potential to differentiate between dynamical
scenarios of stellar interaction.

diagnostics are the relative properties of the black hole and its host galaxy.
However, up to now, the detection of stars in quasar host galaxies has been
elusive beyond $z>2$, even with deep HST observations. Here, we report the
first detections of the stellar component of the host galaxies of two
relatively low-luminosity quasars at $z>6$ observed with JWST using NIRCam.
After modeling and subtracting the glare from the quasar itself, we find that
the host galaxies are massive (stellar mass of $2.5\times$ and
$6.3\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), compact, and disk-like. Unlike most SMBHs in
the nearby universe, these quasars are displaced from the centers of their host
galaxies in the rest-frame optical, in one case by $0.9$ kpc. These first

the mass of the planet to be between 2 and 4 M$_{\rm{Jup}}$. When comparing
with self-consistent models, we encounter a known correlation between the
presence of clouds and the shape of the $P-T$ profiles. Our findings support
the idea that results from atmospheric retrievals should not be discussed in

production during inflation from the CMB scales to the interferometer scales.
Considering a Chern-Simons coupling between the gauge bosons and the
pseudoscalar inflaton, one of the transverse gauge modes is efficiently
produced and its inverse decay leaves an imprint in the primordial scalar and
tensor perturbations. We study the correlation functions of these perturbations
and derive the updated constraints on the parameter space from CMB observables.
We then extrapolate the tensor power spectrum to smaller scales consistently
taking into account the impact of the gauge field on inflationary dynamics. Our
results show that the presence of massive gauge fields during inflation can be
detected from characteristic gravitational wave signals encompassing the whole

related by a trivially-acting symmetry can join at a TPO to form non-trivial
two-way junctions. Upon gauging, the local operators at those junctions can
become vacua in a disjoint union of theories. Examining the behavior of the
TPOs under gauging therefore allows us to refine decomposition by tracking the
trivially-acting symmetries of each universe. Mixed anomalies between the TDLs

these orbifolds, modifying the resulting decomposition. This framework also
readily allows for the consideration of trivially-acting non-invertible

a half-life time ($\tau$) significantly longer than the age of the Universe is
not ruled out. One-body decaying dark matter (DDM) consists of a minimal
extension to the $\Lambda$CDM model. It causes a modification of the cosmic
growth history as well as a suppression of the small-scale clustering signal,
providing interesting consequences regarding the $S_8$ tension, which is the
observed difference in the clustering amplitude between weak-lensing (WL) and
cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. In this paper, we investigate
models in which a fraction or all DM decays into radiation, focusing on the
long-lived regime, that is, $\tau \gtrsim H_0^{-1}$ ( $H_0^{-1}$ being the
Hubble time). We used WL data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and CMB data
from Planck. First, we confirm that this DDM model cannot alleviate the $S_8$
difference. We then show that the most constraining power for DM decay does not
come from the nonlinear WL data, but from CMB via the integrated Sachs-Wolfe
effect. From the CMB data alone, we obtain constraints of $\tau \geq 288$~Gyr
if all DM is assumed to be unstable, and we show that a maximum fraction of
$f=0.07$ is allowed to decay assuming the half-life time to be comparable to
(or shorter than) one Hubble time. The constraints from the KiDS-1000 WL data
are significantly weaker, $\tau \geq 60$~Gyr and $f<0.34$. Combining the CMB

short half-life times, for which the maximum allowed fraction becomes $f=0.03$.

invariant in the absence of periodic length scales. Based on their
incommensurate order, novel physical properties such as critical states and
self-similar wavefunctions have been actively discussed. However, in open
systems generally described by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, it is hardly
known how such quasiperiodic order would lead to new phenomena. In this work,
we show for the first time that the intertwined quasiperiodicity and
non-Hermiticity can give rise to striking effects: perfect delocalization of
the critical and localized states to the extended states. In particular, we
explore the wave function localization character in the Aubry-Andre-Fibonacci
(AAF) model where non-reciprocal hopping phases are present. Here, the AAF
model continuously interpolates the two different limit between metal to
insulator transition and critical states, and the nonHermiticity is encoded in
the hopping phase factors. Surprisingly, their interplay results in the perfect
delocalization of the states, which is never allowed in quasiperiodic systems
with Hermiticity. By quantifying the localization via inverse participation
ratio and the fractal dimension, we discuss that the non-Hermitian hopping
phase leads to delicate control of localization characteristics of the wave
function. Our work offers (1) emergent delocalization transition in
quasiperiodic systems via non-Hermitian hopping phase, (2) detailed
localization control of the critical states, (3) experimental realization of
controllable localized, critical and delocalized states, using photonic

important phenomenon used in understanding the geometry and dynamics of

generate variability on relatively fast timescales, the broad-band variability
generated in the outer regions have mostly remained elusive due to their long
intrinsic variability timescales. Ultra-compact AM CVn systems are relatively
small when compared to other accreting binaries and are well suited to search
and characterise low frequency variability. Here we present the first low
frequency power spectral analysis of the ultracompact accreting white dwarf
system SDSS J1908$+$3940. The analysis reveals a low frequency break at $\sim
6.8 \times 10^{-7} $ Hz in the time-averaged power spectrum as well as a second

separation on simulations with five foreground models and input $r$ values
$r_{in}=0$ and $r_{in} = 0.003$. We forecast $r$ determinations using a
Gaussian likelihood assuming either no delensing or a residual lensing factor
$A_{\rm lens}$ = 27%. By implementing the first full-sky, post
component-separation, map-domain delensing, we show that PICO should be able to
achieve $A_{\rm lens}$ = 22% - 24%. For four of the five foreground models we
find that PICO would be able to set the constraints $r < 1.3 \times 10^{-4}
\,\, \mbox{to} \,\, r <2.7 \times 10^{-4}\, (95\%)$ if $r_{in}=0$, the
strongest constraints of any foreseeable instrument. For these models,
$r=0.003$ is recovered with confidence levels between $18\sigma$ and
$27\sigma$. We find weaker, and in some cases significantly biased, upper
limits when removing few low or high frequency bands. The fifth model gives a
$3\sigma$ detection when $r_{in}=0$ and a $3\sigma$ bias with $r_{in} = 0.003$.
However, by correlating $r$ determinations from many small 2.5% sky areas with
the mission's 555 GHz data we identify and mitigate the bias. This analysis
underscores the importance of large sky coverage. We show that when only low
multipoles $\ell \leq 12$ are used, the non-Gaussian shape of the true
likelihood gives uncertainties that are on average 30% larger than a Gaussian

rigorous vision of a scalable end-to-end semantic communication network that is
founded on novel concepts from artificial intelligence (AI), causal reasoning,
and communication theory. We first discuss how the design of semantic
communication networks requires a move from data-driven networks towards
knowledge-driven ones. Subsequently, we highlight the necessity of creating
semantic representations of data that satisfy the key properties of minimalism,
generalizability, and efficiency so as to do more with less. We then explain
how those representations can form the basis a so-called semantic language. By
using semantic representation and languages, we show that the traditional
transmitter and receiver now become a teacher and apprentice. Then, we define
the concept of reasoning by investigating the fundamentals of causal
representation learning and their role in designing semantic communication
networks. We demonstrate that reasoning faculties are majorly characterized by
the ability to capture causal and associational relationships in datastreams.
For such reasoning-driven networks, we propose novel and essential semantic
communication metrics that include new ""reasoning capacity"" measures that could
go beyond Shannon's bound to capture the convergence of computing and
communication. Finally, we explain how semantic communications can be scaled to
large-scale networks (6G and beyond). In a nutshell, we expect this tutorial to

information. Therefore, in addition to extracting complex contents using the
latest vision technologies (including deep learning-based), their
representation as well as querying pose different kinds of challenges. Once we
have a representation to accommodate extracted contents, ad-hoc querying on
that will need new operators, along with their semantics and algorithms for
their efficient computation. Extending database framework (representation and
real-time querying) for processing queries on video contents extracted only
once is critical and this effort is an initial step in that direction. In this
paper, we extend the traditional relation to R++ (vector attributes) and
arrables to accommodate video contents and extend CQL (Continuous Query

heuristics follow Occam's razor and advise choosing the ones with least
capacity. Yet, modern practice with large neural networks has often led to
situations where two networks with exactly the same number of parameters score
similar on the training set, but the deeper one generalizes better to unseen
examples. With this in mind, it is well accepted that deep networks are
superior to shallow wide ones. However, theoretically there is no difference
between the two. In fact, they are both universal approximators.
  In this work we propose a new unsupervised measure that predicts how well a
model will generalize. We call it the output sharpness, and it is based on the
fact that, in reality, boundaries between concepts are generally unsharp. We
test this new measure on several neural network settings, and architectures,
and show how generally strong the correlation is between our metric, and test
set performance.
  Having established this measure, we give a mathematical probabilistic
argument that predicts network depth to be correlated with our proposed
measure. After verifying this in real data, we are able to formulate the key
argument of the work: output sharpness hampers generalization; deep networks
have an in built bias against it; therefore, deep networks beat wide ones.
  All in all the work not only provides a helpful predictor of overfitting that
can be used in practice for model selection (or even regularization), but also
provides a much needed theoretical grounding for the success of modern deep

affect kilonova spectra and light curves. Specifically, we compute five models:
one ($\texttt{FIDUCIAL}$) with an appropriate treatment of these three

affect the star formation process is key. From an observational point of view,
the feedback from young high-mass stars on future star formation properties is
still poorly constrained. In the framework of the IRAM 30m ORION-B large
program, we obtained observations of the translucent and moderately dense gas,
which we used to analyze the kinematics over a field of 5 deg^2 around the
filamentary structures. We used the ROHSA algorithm to decompose and de-noise
the C18O(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) signals by taking the spatial coherence of the
emission into account. We produced gas column density and mean velocity maps to
estimate the relative orientation of their spatial gradients. We identified
three cloud velocity layers at different systemic velocities and extracted the
filaments in each velocity layer. The filaments are preferentially located in
regions of low centroid velocity gradients. By comparing the relative
orientation between the column density and velocity gradients of each layer
from the ORION-B observations and synthetic observations from 3D kinematic toy
models, we distinguish two types of behavior in the dynamics around filaments:
(i) radial flows perpendicular to the filament axis that can be either inflows
(increasing the filament mass) or outflows and (ii) longitudinal flows along
the filament axis. The former case is seen in the Orion B data, while the
latter is not identified. We have also identified asymmetrical flow patterns,
usually associated with filaments located at the edge of an HII region. This is
the first observational study to highlight feedback from HII regions on
filament formation and, thus, on star formation in the Orion B cloud. This
simple statistical method can be used for any molecular cloud to obtain
coherent information on the kinematics.

  healthy and pathological conditions",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Airway mucus is a complex material with both viscoelastic and viscoplastic
properties that vary with healthy and pathological lung conditions. In this
study, the effects of these conditions on airway closure are examined in a
model problem, where an elastoviscoplastic (EVP) single liquid layer lines the
inner wall of a rigid pipe and surrounds the air core. The EVP liquid layer is
modelled using the Saramito-HB model. Model parameters are obtained for the
mucus in healthy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
cystic fibrosis (CF) conditions by fitting the rheological model to
experimental data. Then, liquid plug formation is studied by varying the
Laplace number and undisturbed liquid film thickness. According to previous
studies, airway epithelial cells can be damaged by high peak of the wall
stresses and stress gradients during liquid plug formation. Here, we show that
these stresses are also related to the EVP features of the liquid layer.
Yielded zones of the liquid layer are examined for different mucus conditions.
Before closure, liquid layer is found to be unyielded, indicating that this
phase is dominated by the elastic behaviour and solvent viscosity. This is
further confirmed by showing that the elastic coefficient is important in
determining whether closure occurs or not. Wall stresses are also investigated
for pathological and healthy cases. Their peaks are higher in COPD and CF due
to the viscoelastic extra stress contribution. Unlike the Newtonian case, COPD
and CF wall stresses do not relax after closure but remain approximately as
high as the Newtonian peak. Moreover, the local normal wall stress gradients
are smaller in COPD and CF liquid layers since their higher stiffness causes
smaller curvature at the capillary wave. The local tangential wall stress
gradients are also lower in these cases due to slower accumulation of the
liquid at the bulge.

consider a system of 2D point vortices submitted to a small external stochastic
perturbation and determine the response of the system to the perturbation. We
derive the diffusion coefficient and the drift by polarization of a test
vortex. We introduce a general Fokker-Planck equation involving a diffusion
term and a drift term. When the drift by polarization can be neglected, we
obtain a secular dressed diffusion (SDD) equation sourced by the external
noise. When the external perturbation is created by a discrete collection of
$N$ point vortices, we obtain a Lenard-Balescu-like kinetic equation reducing
to a Landau-like kinetic equation when collective effects are neglected. We
consider a multi-species system of point vortices. We discuss the process of
kinetic blocking in the single and multi-species cases. When the field vortices
are at statistical equilibrium (thermal bath), we establish the proper
expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for 2D point vortices
relating the power spectrum of the fluctuations to the response function of the
system. In that case, the drift coefficient and the diffusion coefficient
satisfy an Einstein-like relation and the Fokker Planck equation reduces to a
Smoluchowski-like equation. We mention the analogy between 2D point vortices
and stellar systems. In particular, the drift of a point vortex in 2D
hydrodynamics is the counterpart of the Chandrasekhar dynamical friction in
astrophysics. We also consider a gas of 2D Brownian point vortices described by
$N$ coupled stochastic Langevin equations and determine its mean and mesoscopic

  We here focus our attention on the standard multigraded case, which

$\mathbb Z^k$-graded module is its support: degrees in which it is not zero. A
stabilized version of it is adding $-\mathbb N^k$, in order for the complement
(vanishing region) to be stable by addition of $\mathbb N^k$.
  Cohomology of twists of a sheaf on a product of projective spaces, provided
by a graded module, are given by local cohomologies with respect to the product
$B$ of the ideals $B_i$ generated by the $k$ sets of variables.
  Our results shed some light on a central issue, the relation between shifts
in graded free resolution and cohomology vanishing: it shows that stabilized
support of cohomology with respect to $B$ corresponds to the union of
stabilized supports for cohomologies in the $B_i$'s, while shifts in (some of
the) graded free resolutions are inside the intersection of these stabilized
supports. A one-to-one correspondence between stabilized supports of Tor
modules and of local cohomologies with respect to the sum of the $B_i$'s is
also established.

understand how a society works. However, gender bias, e.g., stereotypical
gender roles, in this literature may cause harm and skew children's world view.
Instead of decades of qualitative and manual analysis of gender bias in fairy
tales, we computationally analyze gender bias in a fairy tale dataset
containing 624 fairy tales from 7 different cultures. We specifically examine
gender difference in terms of moral foundations, which are measures of human
morality, and events, which reveal human activities associated with each
character. We find that the number of male characters is two times that of
female characters, showing a disproportionate gender representation. Our
analysis further reveal stereotypical portrayals of both male and female
characters in terms of moral foundations and events. Female characters turn out
more associated with care-, loyalty- and sanctity- related moral words, while
male characters are more associated with fairness- and authority- related moral
words. Female characters' events are often about emotion (e.g., weep),
appearance (e.g., comb), household (e.g., bake), etc.; while male characters'
events are more about profession (e.g., hunt), violence (e.g., destroy),
justice (e.g., judge), etc. Gender bias in terms of moral foundations shows an
obvious difference across cultures. For example, female characters are more
associated with care and sanctity in high uncertainty-avoidance cultures which
are less open to changes and unpredictability. Based on the results, we propose
implications for children's literature and early literacy research.

then in 2017 partially re-ignited into a repeat flaring state, unusual for an
AGN. Our \emph{Swift} observations since 2013 allow us to characterise the
accretion-generated emission and its reprocessing in the central engine of a
changing-look AGN. The X-ray and UV variability amplitudes are higher than
those typically observed in `steady-state' AGN at similar moderate accretion
rates; instead, the variability is similar to that of highly accreting AGN. The
unusually strong X-ray to UV correlation suggests that the UV-emitting region
is directly illuminated by X-ray outbursts. We find evidence that the X-rays
are reprocessed by two UV components, with the dominant one at $\sim$3 days and
a faint additional reprocessor at near-zero lag. However, we exclude a
significant contribution from diffuse broad line region continuum, known to
contribute for bona-fide AGN. A near-zero lag is expected for a standard
`lamp-post' disk reprocessing model with a driving continuum source near the
black hole. That the overall UV response is dominated by the $\sim$3-day lagged
component suggests a complicated reprocessing geometry, with most of the UV
continuum not produced in a compact disk, as also found in recent studies of
NGC 5548 and NGC 4151. Nonetheless, the observed flares display characteristic
timescales of $\sim$100 rest-frame days, consistent with the expected thermal
timescale in an accretion disk.

induced by fast-moving electrons interacting with optical media. Historically,
it has been understood that, just like any other photon emission process,
free-electron radiation must be constrained within a finite time interval known
as the ""formation time"", whose concept is applicable to both Cherenkov
radiation and transition radiation, the two basic mechanisms describing
radiation from a bulk medium and from an interface, respectively. Here we
reveal an alternative mechanism of free-electron radiation far beyond the
previously defined formation time. It occurs when a fast electron crosses the
interface between vacuum and a plasmonic medium supporting bulk plasmons. While
emitted continuously from the crossing point on the interface - thus consistent
with the features of transition radiation - the extra radiation beyond the
conventional formation time is supported by a long tail of bulk plasmons
following the electron's trajectory deep into the plasmonic medium. Such a
plasmonic tail mixes surface and bulk effects, and provides a sustained channel
for electron-interface interaction. These results also settle the historical
debate in Ferrell radiation, regarding whether it is a surface or bulk effect,
from transition radiation or plasmonic oscillation.

two-channel content for the same applications. However, SE systems are
typically designed for monaural input; stereo results produced using trivial
methods such as channel independent or mid-side processing may be
unsatisfactory, including substantial speech distortions. To address this, we
propose a system which creates a novel representation of stereo signals called
Custom Mid-Side Signals (CMSS). CMSS allow benefits of mid-side signals for
center-panned speech to be extended to a much larger class of input signals.
This in turn allows any existing monaural SE system to operate as an efficient
stereo system by processing the custom mid signal. We describe how the
parameters needed for CMSS can be efficiently estimated by a component of the
spatio-level filtering source separation system. Subjective listening using
state-of-the-art deep learning-based SE systems on stereo content with various
speech mixing styles shows that CMSS processing leads to improved speech
quality at approximately half the cost of channel-independent processing.

important to properly describe precision observables. We analyse a set of decay
modes and cross sections, in the low-energy regime, to determine the role
played by this meson. This is done through the extraction of the parameters for
its description, in the context of the vector meson dominance model and its
effective hadronic interactions, involving the low mass lying hadrons ($\rho$,
$\omega$ and $\pi$). In a first step, we determine the parameters of the model
from ten decay modes which are insensitive to the $\rho^\prime$. Then, we
consider the $\omega \rightarrow 3\pi$ decay and exhibit the need to extend the
description, by incorporating the $\rho^\prime$ and a contact term as
prescribed by the Wess-Zumino-Witten anomaly. In a second step, we incorporate
the data from the $e^+e^- \rightarrow 3\pi$ cross section (as measured by SND,
CMD2, BABAR and BESIII) and then the $e^+e^- \rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0 \gamma$
data (as measured by SND and CDM2) to further restrict the $\rho^\prime$
parameters validity region. As an application of the results, we compute the
$e^+e^- \rightarrow 4\pi$ cross section for the so-called omega channel,
measured by BABAR, and find a good description of the data considering the
parameters found. As a byproduct, the coupling between $\rho$, $\omega$ and
$\pi$ ($g_{\rho\omega\pi}= 11.314 \pm 0.383$ GeV$^{-1}$) is found to be
consistent with all the relevant observables, upon the inclusion of the

graph analytical problems in various real-world applications. Nevertheless,
GNNs could potentially render biased predictions towards certain demographic
subgroups. Understanding how the bias in predictions arises is critical, as it
guides the design of GNN debiasing mechanisms. However, most existing works
overwhelmingly focus on GNN debiasing, but fall short on explaining how such
bias is induced. In this paper, we study a novel problem of interpreting GNN
unfairness through attributing it to the influence of training nodes.
Specifically, we propose a novel strategy named Probabilistic Distribution
Disparity (PDD) to measure the bias exhibited in GNNs, and develop an algorithm
to efficiently estimate the influence of each training node on such bias. We
verify the validity of PDD and the effectiveness of influence estimation
through experiments on real-world datasets. Finally, we also demonstrate how
the proposed framework could be used for debiasing GNNs. Open-source code can

and on the communities' political leanings. We observe both the echo chamber
and hostile intergroup interaction phenomena, but neither holds universally
across communities. Contrary to popular belief, we find that polarizing and
toxic speech is more dominant between communities on the same, rather than
opposing, sides of the political spectrum, especially on the left; however,
this mainly points to the collective targeting of political outgroups.

Despite the presence of singular source terms, which imply discontinuous or
potentially singular solutions, our DG method achieves global spectral accuracy
even at the source's location. Our DG method is developed for the wave equation
written in fully first-order form. The first-order reduction is carried out
using a distributional auxiliary variable that removes some of the source
term's singular behavior. While this is helpful numerically, it gives rise to a
distributional constraint. We show that a time-independent spurious solution

Numerical experiments verify this behavior and our scheme's convergence
properties by comparing against exact solutions.

has been introduced. FL is designed so that server never collects user-owned
data meaning it is great at preserving privacy. FL's process starts with the
server sending a model to clients, then the clients train that model using
their data and send the updated model back to the server. Afterward, the server
aggregates all the updates and modifies the global model. This process is
repeated until the model converges. This study focuses on an FL setting called
cross-device FL, which trains based on a large number of clients. Since many
devices may be unavailable in cross-device FL, and communication between the
server and all clients is extremely costly, only a fraction of clients gets
selected for training at each round. In vanilla FL, clients are selected
randomly, which results in an acceptable accuracy but is not ideal from the
overall training time perspective, since some clients are slow and can cause
some training rounds to be slow. If only fast clients get selected the learning
would speed up, but it will be biased toward only the fast clients' data, and
the accuracy degrades. Consequently, new client selection techniques have been
proposed to improve the training time by considering individual clients'
resources and speed. This paper introduces the first availability-aware
selection strategy called MDA. The results show that our approach makes
learning faster than vanilla FL by up to 6.5%. Moreover, we show that resource
heterogeneity-aware techniques are effective but can become even better when
combined with our approach, making it faster than the state-of-the-art
selectors by up to 16%. Lastly, our approach selects more unique clients for
training compared to client selectors that only select fast clients, which
reduces our technique's bias.

methods are contrastive methods, which use a combination of positive and

sampling (slowness and model sensitivity), recent literature introduced
non-contrastive methods, which instead only use positive samples. Though such
methods have shown promising performance in node-level tasks, their suitability
for link prediction tasks, which are concerned with predicting link existence
between pairs of nodes (and have broad applicability to recommendation systems
contexts) is yet unexplored. In this work, we extensively evaluate the
performance of existing non-contrastive methods for link prediction in both
transductive and inductive settings. While most existing non-contrastive
methods perform poorly overall, we find that, surprisingly, BGRL generally
performs well in transductive settings. However, it performs poorly in the more
realistic inductive settings where the model has to generalize to links to/from
unseen nodes. We find that non-contrastive models tend to overfit to the

prevent disease progression. We perform a comprehensive study of machine
learning-based fibrosis detection in CT images using radiomic features to
develop a non-invasive approach to fibrosis detection.
  Methods: Two sets of radiomic features were extracted from spherical ROIs in
CT images of 182 patients who underwent simultaneous liver biopsy and CT
examinations, one set corresponding to biopsy locations and another distant
from biopsy locations. Combinations of contrast, normalization, machine
learning model, feature selection method, bin width, and kernel radius were
investigated, each of which were trained and evaluated 100 times with
randomized development and test cohorts. The best settings were evaluated based
on their mean test AUC and the best features were determined based on their
frequency among the best settings.
  Results: Logistic regression models with NC images normalized using Gamma
correction with $\gamma = 1.5$ performed best for fibrosis detection. Boruta
was the best for radiomic feature selection method. Training a model using
these optimal settings and features consisting of first order energy, first
order kurtosis, and first order skewness, resulted in a model that achieved
mean test AUCs of 0.7549 and 0.7166 on biopsy-based and non-biopsy ROIs
respectively, outperforming a baseline and best models found during the initial
study.
  Conclusions: Logistic regression models trained on radiomic features from NC
images normalized using Gamma correction with $\gamma = 1.5$ that underwent
Boruta feature selection are effective for liver fibrosis detection. Energy,
kurtosis, and skewness are particularly effective features for fibrosis
detection.

stars, and test predictions from 3D hydrodynamic models. For the first time, we
observed two bright stars (Teff = 5833 K and 6205 K) with high-precision
observations taken simultaneously with CHEOPS and ESPRESSO. We analyzed the
properties of the stellar granulation signal in each individual data set. We
compared them to Kepler observations and 3D hydrodynamic models. While
isolating the granulation-induced changes by attenuating the p-mode oscillation
signals, we studied the relationship between photometric and spectroscopic
observables. The signature of stellar granulation is detected and precisely
characterized for the hotter F star in the CHEOPS and ESPRESSO observations.
For the cooler G star, we obtain a clear detection in the CHEOPS dataset only.
The TESS observations are blind to this stellar signal. Based on CHEOPS
observations, we show that the inferred properties of stellar granulation are
in agreement with both Kepler observations and hydrodynamic models. Comparing
their periodograms, we observe a strong link between spectroscopic and
photometric observables. Correlations of this stellar signal in the time domain
(flux vs RV) and with specific spectroscopic observables (shape of the
cross-correlation functions) are however difficult to isolate due to
signal-to-noise dependent variations. In the context of the upcoming PLATO
mission and the extreme precision RV surveys, a thorough understanding of the
properties of the stellar granulation signal is needed. The CHEOPS and ESPRESSO
observations pave the way for detailed analyses of this stellar process.

temporal information dynamics of spikes. However, an explicit analysis of
temporal information dynamics is still missing. In this paper, we ask several
important questions for providing a fundamental understanding of SNNs: What are
temporal information dynamics inside SNNs? How can we measure the temporal
information dynamics? How do the temporal information dynamics affect the
overall learning performance? To answer these questions, we estimate the Fisher
Information of the weights to measure the distribution of temporal information
during training in an empirical manner. Surprisingly, as training goes on,
Fisher information starts to concentrate in the early timesteps. After
training, we observe that information becomes highly concentrated in earlier
few timesteps, a phenomenon we refer to as temporal information concentration.
We observe that the temporal information concentration phenomenon is a common
learning feature of SNNs by conducting extensive experiments on various
configurations such as architecture, dataset, optimization strategy, time
constant, and timesteps. Furthermore, to reveal how temporal information
concentration affects the performance of SNNs, we design a loss function to
change the trend of temporal information. We find that temporal information

learning tasks. However, these Transformer models directly work on graph nodes
and may have difficulties learning high-level information. Inspired by the
vision transformer, which applies to image patches, we propose a new
Transformer-based graph neural network: Patch Graph Transformer (PatchGT).
Unlike previous transformer-based models for learning graph representations,
PatchGT learns from non-trainable graph patches, not from nodes directly. It
can help save computation and improve the model performance. The key idea is to
segment a graph into patches based on spectral clustering without any trainable
parameters, with which the model can first use GNN layers to learn patch-level
representations and then use Transformer to obtain graph-level representations.
The architecture leverages the spectral information of graphs and combines the
strengths of GNNs and Transformers. Further, we show the limitations of
previous hierarchical trainable clusters theoretically and empirically. We also
prove the proposed non-trainable spectral clustering method is permutation
invariant and can help address the information bottlenecks in the graph.
PatchGT achieves higher expressiveness than 1-WL-type GNNs, and the empirical
study shows that PatchGT achieves competitive performances on benchmark
datasets and provides interpretability to its predictions. The implementation

structure in frequency domain for efficient learning of long-range correlations
in space or time: frequency-domain models (FDMs). Existing FDMs are based on
complex-valued transforms i.e. Fourier Transforms (FT), and layers that perform
computation on the spectrum and input data separately. This design introduces
considerable computational overhead: for each layer, a forward and inverse FT.
Instead, this work introduces a blueprint for frequency domain learning through
a single transform: transform once (T1). To enable efficient, direct learning
in the frequency domain we derive a variance-preserving weight initialization
scheme and investigate methods for frequency selection in reduced-order FDMs.
Our results noticeably streamline the design process of FDMs, pruning redundant
transforms, and leading to speedups of 3x to 10x that increase with data
resolution and model size. We perform extensive experiments on learning the
solution operator of spatio-temporal dynamics, including incompressible
Navier-Stokes, turbulent flows around airfoils and high-resolution video of
smoke. T1 models improve on the test performance of FDMs while requiring
significantly less computation (5 hours instead of 32 for our large-scale
experiment), with over 20% reduction in average predictive error across tasks.

The latter is the duality between flux and force induced by a convex and

These two are connected topologically by the homological algebraic relation

proposed to observe very weak signals like those for long range interactions

provide. Quantum resources to go beyond the standard quantum limit of noise in
these sensors include squeezing of the light used to transduce the signal,
backaction evasion by measuring the optimum quadrature, and quantum

  Inference","Accepted by EMNLP 2022 (long paper)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Document-level relation extraction (RE) aims to extract the relations between
entities from the input document that usually containing many
difficultly-predicted entity pairs whose relations can only be predicted
through relational inference. Existing methods usually directly predict the
relations of all entity pairs of input document in a one-pass manner, ignoring
the fact that predictions of some entity pairs heavily depend on the predicted
results of other pairs. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a
novel document-level RE model with iterative inference. Our model is mainly
composed of two modules: 1) a base module expected to provide preliminary
relation predictions on entity pairs; 2) an inference module introduced to
refine these preliminary predictions by iteratively dealing with
difficultly-predicted entity pairs depending on other pairs in an easy-to-hard
manner. Unlike previous methods which only consider feature information of
entity pairs, our inference module is equipped with two Extended Cross
Attention units, allowing it to exploit both feature information and previous
predictions of entity pairs during relational inference. Furthermore, we adopt
a two-stage strategy to train our model. At the first stage, we only train our
base module. During the second stage, we train the whole model, where
contrastive learning is introduced to enhance the training of inference module.
Experimental results on three commonly-used datasets show that our model
consistently outperforms other competitive baselines.

sandwiched between layers of coordinating hydroxide anions have attracted
considerable interest for their potential in developing clean energy sources

unstudied in terms of their physical properties and the applications in
electronic devices. Here, directed by the relationship of the spin state of 3d
transition metal (TM) ions such as Ni, Co, Cu, and the corresponding geometry
of the crystal field, we discover that Ni2+ with perfect Oh symmetry is ideal
for intraplanar growth, leading to the achievement of >20 {\mu}m
{\alpha}-Ni(OH)2 2D crystals with high yield, which are the largest 2D domains
reported so far. We also report the successful synthesis of 2D Co(OH)2 crystals
(>40 {\mu}m) with less yield due to the slight geometry distortion resulted
from uneven number of electrons. Moreover, the detailed structural
characterization of synthesized {\alpha}-Ni(OH)2 are performed; the optical
band gap energy is extrapolated as 2.54 eV from optical absorption measurements
and is measured as 2.50 eV from reflected electrons energy loss spectroscopy
(REELS), suggesting the potential as insulating 2D dielectric material for
electronic devices. Furthermore, key parameters of the hydrothermal reaction
including soaking temperature, starting pH and cooling rate, are systematically
tuned to understand their effects on morphological and crystallographic
perspectives, allowing the establishment of a 2D growth mechanism. This work
demonstrates a scalable pathway to synthesize large 2D LTMHs from simple
methods, paving the way for the study of fundamental physical properties and
device applications of 2D LTMHs.

outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of four important evaluation

171 A images, we investigated a series of QFP wave trains composed of multiple
wavefronts propagating along a loop system during the accompanying flare on
2011 November 11. The wave trains showed a high correlation in start time with
the energy release of the accompanying flare. Measurements show that the wave
trains phase speed is almost consistent with its group speed with a value of
about 1000 km s-1, indicating that the wave trains should not be dispersed
waves. The period of the wave trains was the same as that of the oscillatory
signal in X ray emissions released by the flare. Thus we propose that the QFP

graph neural networks (KGNNs) are essential techniques for knowledge graph
representation learning. Although KGNN effectively models the structural
information from knowledge graphs, these frameworks amplify the underlying data
bias that leads to discrimination towards certain groups or individuals in
resulting applications. Additionally, as existing debiasing approaches mainly
focus on the entity-wise bias, eliminating the multi-hop relational bias that
pervasively exists in knowledge graphs remains an open question. However, it is
very challenging to eliminate relational bias due to the sparsity of the paths
that generate the bias and the non-linear proximity structure of knowledge
graphs. To tackle the challenges, we propose Fair-KGNN, a KGNN framework that
simultaneously alleviates multi-hop bias and preserves the proximity
information of entity-to-relation in knowledge graphs. The proposed framework
is generalizable to mitigate the relational bias for all types of KGNN. We
develop two instances of Fair-KGNN incorporating with two state-of-the-art KGNN
models, RGCN and CompGCN, to mitigate gender-occupation and nationality-salary
bias. The experiments carried out on three benchmark knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that the Fair-KGNN can effectively mitigate unfair situations
during representation learning while preserving the predictive performance of
KGNN models.

and applied fields. A small number of such nodes have deterministic power to
decide information spreading, so it is of importance to find a set of nodes
that maximize the propagation in networks. Based on baseline ranking methods,
various improved methods were proposed, but there does not exist one enhanced
method that covers all the base methods. In this paper, we propose a penalized
method called RCD-Map, which is short for resampling community detection to
maximize propagation, on five baseline ranking methods(Degree centrality,
Closeness centrality, Betweennees centrality, K-shell and PageRank) with nodes'
local community information. We perturbed the original graph by resampling to
decrease the biases and randomness brought by community detection methods-both
overlapping and non-overlapping methods. To assess the performance of our
identifying method, SIR(susceptible-infected-recovered) model is applied to
simulate the information propagation process. The result shows that methods
with penalties perform better with a vaster propagation range in general.

segmentation but usually require abundant annotated data. However, due to the
gigapixel scale of whole slide images and pathologists' heavy daily workload,
obtaining pixel-level labels for supervised learning in clinical practice is
often infeasible. Alternatively, weakly-supervised segmentation methods have
been explored with less laborious image-level labels, but their performance is
unsatisfactory due to the lack of dense supervision. Inspired by the recent
success of self-supervised learning methods, we present a label-efficient
tissue prototype dictionary building pipeline and propose to use the obtained
prototypes to guide histopathology image segmentation. Particularly, taking
advantage of self-supervised contrastive learning, an encoder is trained to
project the unlabeled histopathology image patches into a discriminative
embedding space where these patches are clustered to identify the tissue
prototypes by efficient pathologists' visual examination. Then, the encoder is
used to map the images into the embedding space and generate pixel-level pseudo
tissue masks by querying the tissue prototype dictionary. Finally, the pseudo
masks are used to train a segmentation network with dense supervision for
better performance. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our
human-machine interactive tissue prototype learning method can achieve
comparable segmentation performance as the fully-supervised baselines with less
annotation burden and outperform other weakly-supervised methods. Codes will be
available upon publication.

significant differences between the small and the large mammals, as well as
between rest and effort, regarding the spatial distribution of heat and water
exchanges in the lungs, and in terms of regime of mass transfer taking place in
the lumen of the airways. Interestingly, the results show that the mammalian
lungs appear to be designed just right to fully condition the air at maximal
effort: all generations of the bronchial region of the lungs are mobilized for
this purpose. For mammals with a mass above a certain threshold ($\simeq 5$ kg
at rest and $\simeq 50$ g at maximal effort), it appears that the maximal value
of this evaporation rate scales as $M^{-1/8}$ at rest and $M^{-1/16}$ at
maximal effort and that around 40\% (at rest) or 50\% (at maximal effort) of
the water/heat extracted from the lungs during inspiration is returned to the
bronchial mucosa during expiration, independently of the mass, due to a subtle
coupling between different phenomena. This last result implies that, above
these thresholds, the amounts of water and heat extracted from the lungs by the
ventilation scale with the mass such as the ventilation rate (i.e. as $M^{3/4}$
at rest and $M^{7/8}$ at maximal effort). Finally, it is worth mentioning that
these amounts appear to remain limited, but not negligible when compared to
relevant global quantities, even at maximal effort (4-6\%).

Finally, we introduce a metric called racial gradation to study the inter and

ability of the face recognition models. With this study, we try to bring more
understanding to an essential element of face recognition training, the data. A

neuroblastoma brain metastases on MRI. Neuroblastoma is well-suited for our

The testing set was enriched with 83% outside images. DNE converged to a

regions communicate with each other. The full chorus of conversations within
the brain is summarized elegantly in the adjacency matrix. Although
information-rich, adjacency matrices typically provide little in the way of
intuition. Whereas trained radiologists viewing anatomic MRI can readily
distinguish between different kinds of brain cancer, a similar determination
using adjacency matrices would exceed any expert's grasp. Artificial
intelligence (AI) in radiology usually analyzes anatomic imaging, providing
assistance to radiologists. For non-intuitive data types such as adjacency
matrices, AI moves beyond the role of helpful assistant, emerging as
indispensible. We sought here to show that AI can learn to discern between two
important brain tumor types, high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma
(LGG), based on adjacency matrices. We trained a convolutional neural networks
(CNN) with the method of deep neuroevolution (DNE), because of the latter's
recent promising results; DNE has produced remarkably accurate CNNs even when
relying on small and noisy training sets, or performing nuanced tasks. After
training on just 30 adjacency matrices, our CNN could tell HGG apart from LGG
with perfect testing set accuracy. Saliency maps revealed that the network
learned highly sophisticated and complex features to achieve its success.
Hence, we have shown that it is possible for AI to recognize brain tumor type

reblurred to be spatially aligned with blurry image, by predicting a set of

the study of phononic states at DFT and DFT+DMFT level is performed. The

one-component statistical system of scalarly charged degenerate fermions (\MIO
models), the possibility of the formation of black holes in the early Universe
using the mechanism of gravitational-scalar instability, which ensures the
exponential growth of perturbations. The evolution of spherical masses in the
\MIO model, as well as the evolution of black holes with allowance for their
evaporation, is studied. The argumentation of the possibility of the formation

The range of parameters of the \MIO model, which ensures the growth of black

on tackling unseen dynamic slot values (e.g., new songs and locations added),
which is an urgent matter for real dialog systems. To mitigate this issue, we
first propose a novel span-splitting representation for span-based parser that
outperforms existing methods. Then we present a novel lexicon-injected semantic
parser, which collects slot labels of tree representation as a lexicon, and
injects lexical features to the span representation of parser. An additional
slot disambiguation technique is involved to remove inappropriate span match
occurrences from the lexicon. Our best parser produces a new state-of-the-art

frequently updated slot lexicon entries in real task-oriented dialog, with no

Historically, the poor OoD detection performance of these models has motivated
the design of methods based on model re-training using synthetic training
images that include OoD visual objects. Although successful, these re-trained
methods have two issues: 1) their in-distribution segmentation accuracy may
drop during re-training, and 2) their OoD detection accuracy does not
generalise well to new contexts (e.g., country surroundings) outside the

with: (i) a new residual pattern learning (RPL) module that assists the
segmentation model to detect OoD pixels without affecting the inlier
segmentation performance; and (ii) a novel context-robust contrastive learning
(CoroCL) that enforces RPL to robustly detect OoD pixels among various

develop an improved reactive force field (ReaxFF) parameter set for
atomistically resolved molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated diamondoids
to characterize their interfacial water structure. We parameterize the force
field and validate the water structure against geometry-optimized structures

However, the response of the water molecules is most sensitive to the partial

exclusion of atomistic detail we can draw generic conclusions about the nature
of the hydrophobic effect at nanoparticle interfaces and link it to the
interfacial water structure. The interactions between discrete partial charges
on short length scales affect the hydration structures strongly but the
hydrophobic effect seems to be stable against these short scale surface

costly to obtain paired and rich-labeled ground truth. Differently, photo
retrieval data is easier to acquire. Therefore, previous works pre-train their
models on rich-labeled photo retrieval data (i.e., source domain) and then
fine-tune them on the limited-labeled sketch-to-photo retrieval data (i.e.,
target domain). However, without co-training source and target data, source
domain knowledge might be forgotten during the fine-tuning process, while
simply co-training them may cause negative transfer due to domain gaps.
Moreover, identity label spaces of source data and target data are generally
disjoint and therefore conventional category-level Domain Adaptation (DA) is
not directly applicable. To address these issues, we propose an Instance-level
Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (IHDA) framework. We apply the fine-tuning
strategy for identity label learning, aiming to transfer the instance-level
knowledge in an inductive transfer manner. Meanwhile, labeled attributes from
the source data are selected to form a shared label space for source and target
domains. Guided by shared attributes, DA is utilized to bridge cross-dataset
domain gaps and heterogeneous domain gaps, which transfers instance-level
knowledge in a transductive transfer manner. Experiments show that our method
has set a new state of the art on three sketch-to-photo image retrieval

effective models on limited-labeled heterogeneous image retrieval tasks.

numerical simulations, which has prevented previous studies from reaching grid
convergence of fragment statistics. We therefore adopt the manifold death (MD)
algorithm which artificially perforates thin films once they reach a prescribed
critical thickness independent of the grid size, controlled by a numerical
parameter $L_{\rm sig}$. We show grid convergence of fragment statistics when
utilising the MD algorithm, and analyse the fragment behaviour and bag film
disintegration mechanisms including ligament breakup, node detachment and rim
destabilisation. Our choice of the critical thickness parameter $L_{\rm sig}$
is limited by numerical constraints and thus has not been matched to experiment

perforation thicknesses larger than experimentally observed. The influence of
the MD algorithm configuration on the bag breakup phenomena and statistics will
be investigated in future work. We also study the effects of moderate liquid

fragment statistics, where a non-monotonic dependency of the average diameter

  Transformation","Accepted by AAAI-2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One-shot segmentation of brain tissues is typically a dual-model iterative
learning: a registration model (reg-model) warps a carefully-labeled atlas onto
unlabeled images to initialize their pseudo masks for training a segmentation
model (seg-model); the seg-model revises the pseudo masks to enhance the
reg-model for a better warping in the next iteration. However, there is a key
weakness in such dual-model iteration that the spatial misalignment inevitably
caused by the reg-model could misguide the seg-model, which makes it converge
on an inferior segmentation performance eventually. In this paper, we propose a
novel image-aligned style transformation to reinforce the dual-model iterative
learning for robust one-shot segmentation of brain tissues. Specifically, we
first utilize the reg-model to warp the atlas onto an unlabeled image, and then
employ the Fourier-based amplitude exchange with perturbation to transplant the
style of the unlabeled image into the aligned atlas. This allows the subsequent
seg-model to learn on the aligned and style-transferred copies of the atlas
instead of unlabeled images, which naturally guarantees the correct spatial
correspondence of an image-mask training pair, without sacrificing the
diversity of intensity patterns carried by the unlabeled images. Furthermore,
we introduce a feature-aware content consistency in addition to the image-level
similarity to constrain the reg-model for a promising initialization, which
avoids the collapse of image-aligned style transformation in the first
iteration. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate 1) a
competitive segmentation performance of our method compared to the
fully-supervised method, and 2) a superior performance over other
state-of-the-art with an increase of average Dice by up to 4.67%. The source

deal with heterophily mainly by mixing high-order neighbors or passing signed

structure and passing signed messages utilizes an inflexible message-passing
mechanism, which is prone to producing unsatisfactory effects. To overcome the
above problems, we propose a novel GNN model based on relation vector
translation named Variational Relation Vector Graph Neural Network (VR-GNN).
VR-GNN models relation generation and graph aggregation into an end-to-end
model based on Variational Auto-Encoder. The encoder utilizes the structure,
feature and label to generate a proper relation vector. The decoder achieves
superior node representation by incorporating the relation translation into the
message-passing framework. VR-GNN can fully capture the homophily and
heterophily between nodes due to the great flexibility of relation translation
in modeling neighbor relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on eight

the effectiveness of our model. The experimental results show that VR-GNN gains
consistent and significant improvements against state-of-the-art GNN methods

framework of optimal control problems for partial differential equations. We
combine two approaches used for reducing the computational cost of the
mathematical numerical models: domain-decomposition (DD) methods and
reduced-order modelling (ROM). In particular, we consider an optimisation-based
domain-decomposition algorithm for the parameter-dependent stationary
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Firstly, the problem is described on
the subdomains coupled at the interface and solved through an optimal control
problem, which leads to the complete separation of the subdomain problems in
the DD method. On top of that, a reduced model for the obtained optimal-control
problem is built; the procedure is based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
technique and a further Galerkin projection. The presented methodology is
tested on two fluid dynamics benchmarks: the stationary backward-facing step
and lid-driven cavity flow. The numerical tests show a significant reduction of
the computational costs in terms of both the problem dimensions and the number
of optimisation iterations in the domain-decomposition algorithm.

poverty-stricken households in access to public transits. These barriers create
a great deal of inconveniences for these impoverished families and more
importantly, they contribute a lot of social inequalities. A typical approach
addressing the issue is to build more transport infrastructure to offer more
opportunities to access the public transits especially for those deprived
communities. Examples include adding more bus lines connecting needy residents
to railways systems and extending existing bus lines to areas with low
socioeconomic status. Recently, a new strategy is proposed, which is to harness
the ubiquitous ride-hailing services to connect disadvantaged households with
the nearest public transportations. Compared with the former
infrastructure-based solution, the ride-hailing-based strategy enjoys a few
exclusive benefits such as higher effectiveness and more flexibility.
  In this paper, we propose an optimization model to study how to integrate the
two approaches together for equity-promotion purposes. Specifically, we aim to
design a strategy of allocating a given limited budget to different candidate
programs such that the overall social equity is maximized, which is defined as
the minimum covering ratio among all pre-specified protected groups of
households (based on race, income, etc.). We have designed a linear-programming
(LP) based rounding algorithm, which proves to achieve an optimal approximation
ratio of 1-1/e. Additionally, we test our algorithm against a few baselines on
real data assembled by outsourcing multiple public datasets collected in the
city of Chicago. Experimental results confirm our theoretical predictions and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our LP-based strategy in promoting social
equity, especially when the budget is insufficient.

to reconstruct three-dimensional biological samples from two-dimensional

in poor reconstruction. The existing CryoET software packages attempt to align

undeformed projections while simultaneously reconstructing the unknown volume.
We achieve this by learning a continuous representation of the undeformed

in complicated geometries. Using classical potential theory, we represent the
solution as the sum of a volume potential and a double layer potential. Rather
than evaluating the volume potential over the given domain, we first extend the
source data to a geometrically simpler region with high order accuracy. This
allows us to accelerate the evaluation of the volume potential using an
efficient, geometry-unaware fast multipole-based algorithm. To impose the
desired boundary condition, it remains only to solve the Laplace equation with
suitably modified boundary data. This is accomplished with existing fast and
accurate boundary integral methods. The novelty of our solver is the scheme
used for creating the source extension, assuming it is provided on an adaptive
quad-tree. For leaf boxes intersected by the boundary, we construct a universal
""stencil"" and require that the data be provided at the subset of those points
that lie within the domain interior. This universality permits us to precompute
and store an interpolation matrix which is used to extrapolate the source data
to an extended set of leaf nodes with full tensor-product grids on each. We
demonstrate the method's speed, robustness and high-order convergence with
several examples, including domains with piecewise smooth boundaries.

of the system is carried out on Rayleigh fading channels for the M-ary

manual construction of a large size training dataset is expensive, we propose a
rule-based weak labeling method utilizing the structured information of an EHR

model and bi-directional long-short term memory with conditional random field
(Bi-LSTM-CRF). Finally, we propose a transfer learning framework that re-uses
the trained parameters of the SOAP classifier trained with the weakly labeled

label-based learning model successfully performed SOAP classification (89.99
F1-score) on the notes collected from the target hospital. Otherwise, in the
notes collected from other hospitals and departments, the performance
dramatically decreased. Meanwhile, we verified that the transfer learning
framework is advantageous for inter-hospital adaptation of the model increasing
the models' performance in every cases. In particular, the transfer learning
approach was more efficient when the manually annotated data size was smaller.
We showed that SOAP classification models trained with our weakly labeling

research analyzed content generated by 2,813 Facebook pages and groups that

result demonstrated that activities of QAnon pages and groups started a

that these pages and groups increasingly relied on internal sources, i.e.,
Facebook accounts or their content on the platform, while their dependence on
external information sources decreased continuously since 2017. It was also
found that QAnon posts based on the Facebook internal sources attracted
significantly more shares and comments compared with other QAnon posts. These
findings suggest that QAnon pages and groups increasingly isolated themselves
from sources outside Facebook while having more internal interactions within
the platform, and the endogenous creation and circulation of disinformation
might play a significant role in boosting the influence of the misleading

inspection is then performed for sources with CNN scores of $P_\mathrm{lens} >

promising route for detecting strong lenses from large catalogs that can

explicitly. A physical model of ODE is put forth, which consists of the inlet,
the constant cross-section combustor and the divergent nozzle. The mathematical
equations to calculate the thrust generated by the divergent nozzle and the
pressure drag produced by the inlet are deduced. The net thrust of ODE is then
obtained. The criterion shows clearly that the static temperature at the engine
inlet exit is a very important parameter. The lower the inlet exit temperature
is, the higher the specific impulse will be. The specific impulse of ODE with
stoichiometric H2/air mixture and hydrocarbon/air mixture are calculated by
using these equations. The results show that ODE can obtain positive net thrust
from Ma8 to Ma15.

been widely explored to benefit the routine screening and early treatment.
Existing researches generally focus on single-field fundus images, which have
limited field of view for precise eye examinations. In clinical applications,
ophthalmologists adopt two-field fundus photography as the dominating tool,
where the information from each field (i.e.,macula-centric and optic
disc-centric) is highly correlated and complementary, and benefits
comprehensive decisions. However, automatic DR grading based on two-field
fundus photography remains a challenging task due to the lack of publicly
available datasets and effective fusion strategies. In this work, we first
construct a new benchmark dataset (DRTiD) for DR grading, consisting of 3,100
two-field fundus images. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest public
DR dataset with diverse and high-quality two-field images. Then, we propose a
novel DR grading approach, namely Cross-Field Transformer (CrossFiT), to
capture the correspondence between two fields as well as the long-range spatial
correlations within each field. Considering the inherent two-field geometric
constraints, we particularly define aligned position embeddings to preserve
relative consistent position in fundus. Besides, we perform masked cross-field
attention during interaction to flter the noisy relations between fields.
Extensive experiments on our DRTiD dataset and a public DeepDRiD dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our CrossFiT network. The new dataset and the

are implemented to ensure the safety of the baby, while white noise is used to
increase the comfort of the baby. In the end, a prototype has been successfully
developed for functionality and reliability testing. Several experiments have
been conducted to measure the efficiency of the mattress's wetness detection,
the RFID transmission range, the frequency spectrum of white noise, and also

efficiency when there is missing data. The most appropriate imputation method
depends on the model the analyst is interested in fitting. Several imputation
approaches have been proposed for when this model is a logistic regression
model with an interaction term that contains a binary partially observed
variable; however, it is not clear which performs best under certain parameter
settings. Methods: Using 1000 simulations, each with 10,000 observations, under
six data-generating mechanisms (DGM), we investigate the performance of four
methods: (i) 'passive imputation', (ii) 'just another variable' (JAV), (iii)
'stratify-impute-append' (SIA), and (iv) 'substantive model compatible fully
conditional specifica-tion' (SMCFCS). The application of each method is shown
in an empirical example using England-based cancer registry data. Results:
SMCFCS and SIA showed the least biased estimate of the coefficients for the
fully, and partially, observed variable and the interaction term. SMCFCS and
SIA showed good coverage and low relative error for all DGMs. SMCFCS had a
large bias when there was a low prevalence of the fully observed variable in
the interaction. SIA performed poorly when the fully observed variable in the
interaction had a continuous underlying form. Conclusion: SMCFCS and SIA give
consistent estimation for logistic regression models with an interaction term
when data are missing at random, and either can be used in most analyses.
SMCFCS performed better than SIA when the fully observed variable in the
interaction had an underlying continuous form. Researchers should be cautious
when using SMCFCS when there is a low prevalence of the fully observed variable
in the interaction.

support the development of efficient strategies for both congestion alleviation

models focusing on ride-hailing (solo rides), but no work addressed
ridesplitting (shared rides) in dynamic contexts. Here, we sought to develop a
dynamic aggregated traffic network model capable of representing ride-sourcing
services and background traffic in a macroscopic multi-region urban network. We
combined the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) with detailed state-space
and transition descriptions of background traffic and ride-sourcing vehicles in
their activities to formulate mass conservation equations. Accumulation-based
MFD models might experience additional errors due to the variation profile of
trip lengths, e.g., when vehicles cruise for passengers. We integrate the
so-called M-model that utilizes the total remaining distance to capture
dynamics of regional and inter-regional flows and accumulations for different
vehicle (private or ride-sourcing) states. This aggregated model is capable to
reproduce the dynamics of complex systems without using resource-expensive
simulations. We also show that the model can accurately forecast the vehicles'
conditions in near-future predictions. Later, a comparison with benchmark
models showed lower errors in the proposed model in all states. Finally, we
evaluated the model's robustness to noises in its inputs, and forecast errors
remained below 15% even where inputs were 20% off the actual values for
ride-sourcing vehicles. The development of such a model prepares the path for
developing real-time feedback-based management policies such as priority-based
perimeter control or repositioning strategies for idle ride-sourcing vehicles
and developing regulations over ride-sourcing in congested areas.

the gauge bosons of the Standard Model (SM) in the HELicity Amplitude
Subroutines (HELAS) codes, such that all the SM helicity amplitudes can be
evaluated at the tree level in the LC gauge by using MadGraph. We confirm that
our numerical codes produce physical helicity amplitudes which are consistent
among all gauge choices. We then study interference patterns among Feynman
amplitudes, for a few $2\to3$ scattering processes in QED and QCD, and the
process $\gamma\gamma\to W^+W^-$ followed by the $W^\pm$ decays. We find that
in a generic LC gauge, where all the gauge boson propagators share a common
gauge vector, we cannot remove the off-shell current components which grow with
their energy systematically from all the Feynman amplitudes in $2\to3$
processes. On the other hand, the $5\times5$ LC gauge propagator for the weak
bosons removes components which grow with energy due to the longitudinal
polarization mode of the external bi-fermion currents, and hence can give
$2\to2$ weak boson scattering amplitudes which are free from subtle
cancellation at high energies. The particular choice of the FD gauge vector has
advantages over generic LC gauge, not only because all the terms which grow
with energy of off-shell and on-shell currents are removed systematically from
all the diagrams, but also because no artificial gauge vector direction

distribution, whereas frequentist inference only accommodates a vacuous prior.
Since virtually every real-world application falls somewhere in between these
two extremes, a new approach is needed. This series of papers develops a new
framework that provides valid and efficient statistical inference, prediction,
etc., while accommodating partial prior information and imprecisely-specified
models more generally. This paper fleshes out a general inferential model
construction that not only yields tests, confidence intervals, etc.~with
desirable error rate control guarantees, but also facilitates valid
probabilistic reasoning with de~Finetti-style no-sure-loss guarantees. The key
technical novelty here is a so-called outer consonant approximation of a
general imprecise probability which returns a data- and partial prior-dependent
possibility measure to be used for inference and prediction. Despite some
potentially unfamiliar imprecise-probabilistic concepts in the development, the
result is an intuitive, likelihood-driven framework that will, as expected,
agree with the familiar Bayesian and frequentist solutions in the respective
extreme cases. More importantly, the proposed framework accommodates partial
prior information where available and, therefore, leads to new solutions that
were previously out of reach for both Bayesians and frequentists. Details are
presented here for a wide range of practical situations, including cases

largely predictable loads and reliable generation. The increasing penetration

attention to online optimization methods. However, online optimization is a
broad topic that can be applied in and motivated by different settings,
operated on different time scales, and built on different theoretical
foundations. This paper reviews the various types of online optimization
techniques used in the power systems domain and aims to make clear the
distinction between the most common techniques used. In particular, we
introduce and compare four distinct techniques used covering the breadth of
online optimization techniques used in the power systems domain, i.e.,
optimization-guided dynamic control, feedback optimization for single-period
problems, Lyapunov-based optimization, and online convex optimization
techniques for multi-period problems. Lastly, we recommend some potential
future directions for online optimization in the power systems domain.

Although deep learning methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),

inherent way of editing generated images semantically. Recent studies have
investigated a way of manipulating the latent variable to determine the images
to be generated. However, methods that assume linear semantic arithmetic have
certain limitations in terms of the quality of image editing, whereas methods
that discover nonlinear semantic pathways provide non-commutative editing,
which is inconsistent when applied in different orders. This study proposes a
novel method called deep curvilinear editing (DeCurvEd) to determine semantic
commuting vector fields on the latent space. We theoretically demonstrate that
owing to commutativity, the editing of multiple attributes depends only on the

that compared to previous methods, the nonlinear and commutative nature of
DeCurvEd facilitates the disentanglement of image attributes and provides
higher-quality editing.

noise estimation and non-blind denoising. This paper considers real noise
approximated by heteroscedastic Gaussian/Poisson Gaussian distributions with
in-camera signal processing pipelines. The related works always exploit the
estimated noise prior via channel-wise concatenation followed by a
convolutional layer with spatially sharing kernels. Due to the variable modes
of noise strength and frequency details of all feature positions, this design
cannot adaptively tune the corresponding denoising patterns. To address this

different feature positions can be adaptively inferred by local features from
the image and the noise map. Also, we bring the thought that alternatively
performs noise estimation and non-blind denoising into CNN structure, which
continuously updates noise prior to guide the iterative feature denoising. In
addition, according to the property of heteroscedastic Gaussian distribution, a
novel affine transform block is designed to predict the stationary noise

extensive experiments are conducted on five synthetic datasets and three real

proliferation of work has been developed to identify malicious bitcoin
transactions, the behavior analysis and classification of bitcoin addresses are
largely overlooked by existing tools. In this paper, we propose BAClassifier, a

we consider casting the transactions of the bitcoin address into an address
graph structure, of which we introduce a graph node compression technique and a
graph structure augmentation method to characterize a unified graph
representation. Furthermore, we leverage a graph feature network to learn the
graph representations of each address and generate the graph embeddings.
Finally, we aggregate all graph embeddings of an address into the address-level

behavior classification. As a side contribution, we construct and release a
large-scale annotated dataset that consists of over 2 million real-world
bitcoin addresses and concerns 4 types of address behaviors. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art

dynamics, transport, and equilibrium behaviors of a neutrally buoyant circular
object immersed in an active suspension within a larger closed circular
container. The continuum model of Gao et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2017)
represents the suspension of non-interacting, immotile, extensor-type
microscopic agents that have a direction and strength and align in response to
strain rate. Such a suspension is well known to be unstable above an activity
strength threshold, which depends upon the length scale of the confinement.
Introducing the object leads to additional phenomenology. It can confine fluid
between it and the container wall, which suppresses local suspension activity.
However, its motion also correlates strain rates near its surface with a
concomitant correlated active-stress response. Depending on the suspension
activity strength, these mechanisms lead to either an attraction toward or
repulsion away from the container wall. In addition, a persistent propagating
behavior is found for modest activity strength, which provides a mechanism for
long-range transport. When activity is so weak that the mobility of the object
is essential to support suspension instability and sustain flow, the object
essentially parks and all flow terminates when its mobility is diminished as it
nears the container wall. Together these mechanisms illustrate potential for
performing relatively complex tasks with simple active agents, especially if
activity strength is scheduled in time.

characterized using time lags observed between soft and hard energy bands in
the detector. The time lags are usually computed using the complex cross
spectrum, which is based on the Fourier transforms of the hard and soft time
series data. It has been noted that some active galactic nuclei display soft
X-ray time lags, in addition to the more ubiquitous hard lags. Hard time lags
are thought to be produced via propagating fluctuations, spatial reverberation,
or via the thermal Comptonization of soft seed photons injected into a hot
electron cloud. The physical origin of the soft lags has been a subject of
debate over the last decade. Currently, the reverberation interpretation is
recognized as a leading theory. In this paper, we explore the alternative
possibility that the soft X-ray time lags result partially from the thermal and
bulk Comptonization of monochromatic seed photons, which in the case of the
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495, may correlate with fluorescence of
iron L-line emission. In our model, the seed photons are injected into a hot,
quasi-spherical corona in the inner region of the accretion flow. We develop an
exact, time-dependent analytical model for the thermal and bulk Comptonization
of the seed photons based on a Fourier-transformed radiation transport
equation, and we demonstrate that the model successfully reproduces both the
hard and soft time lags observed from 1H 0707-495.

coupled flow and heat transfer model for a generalized second-grade fluid. This
coupled model consists of a fractional momentum equation and a heat conduction
equation with a generalized form of Fourier law. The second-order fractional
backward difference formula is applied to the temporal discretization and the
Legendre spectral method is used for the spatial discretization. The fully
discrete scheme is proved to be stable and convergent with an accuracy of
$O(\tau^2+N^{-r})$, where $\tau$ is the time step size and $N$ is the
polynomial degree. To reduce the memory requirements and computational cost, a
fast method is developed, which is based on a globally uniform approximation of
the trapezoidal rule for integrals on the real line. And the strict convergence
of the numerical scheme with this fast method is proved. We present the results
of several numerical experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method. Finally, we simulate the unsteady fractional MHD flow and heat transfer
of the generalized second-grade fluid through a porous medium. The effects of
the relevant parameters on the velocity and temperature are presented and

multivariable dynamic systems with constraints. Most real dynamic models are
however affected by plant-model mismatch and process uncertainties, which can
lead to closed-loop performance deterioration and constraint violations.
Methods such as stochastic MPC (SMPC) have been proposed to alleviate these
problems; however, the resulting closed-loop state trajectory might still
significantly violate the prescribed constraints if the real system deviates
from the assumed disturbance distributions made during the controller design.
In this work we propose a novel data-driven distributionally robust MPC scheme
for nonlinear systems. Unlike SMPC, which requires the exact knowledge of the
disturbance distribution, our scheme decides the control action with respect to
the worst distribution from a distribution ambiguity set. This ambiguity set is
defined as a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical distribution. Due to
the potential model errors that cause off-sets, the scheme is also extended by
leveraging an offset-free method. The favorable results of this control scheme
are demonstrated and empirically verified with a nonlinear mass spring system
and a nonlinear CSTR case study.

from the nuclear regions of galaxies has recently been discovered. These
include the disruption of stars by supermassive black holes at the centers of
galaxies - nuclear transients known as tidal disruption events (TDEs). Active
galactic nuclei (AGN) can show extreme changes in the brightness and emission
line intensities, often referred to as changing-look AGN (CLAGN). Given the
physical and observational similarities, the interpretation and distinction of
nuclear transients as CLAGN or TDEs remains difficult. One of the obstacles of
making progress in the field is the lack of well-sampled data of long-lived
nuclear outbursts in AGN. Here, we study PS16dtm, a nuclear transient in a
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy, which has been proposed to be a TDE
candidate. Our aim is to study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of
PS16dtm, in order to better understand the outbursts originating in NLSy1
galaxies. Our extensive multiwavelength follow-up that spans around 2000 days
includes photometry and spectroscopy in the UV/optical, as well as mid-infrared
(MIR) and X-ray observations. Furthermore, we improved an existing
semiempirical model in order to reproduce the spectra and study the evolution
of the spectral lines. The UV/optical light curve shows a double peak at
$\sim50$ and $\sim100$ days after the first detection, and it declines and
flattens afterward, reaching preoutburst levels after 2000 days of monitoring.
The MIR light curve rises almost simultaneously with the optical, but unlike
the UV/optical which is approaching the preoutburst levels in the last epochs
of our observations, the MIR emission is still rising at the time of writing.
The optical spectra show broad Balmer features and the strongest broad Fe II
emission ever detected in a nuclear transient. [abridged]

between seed nodes and communities. Further, our approach employs entropy
within communities to ensure the proper spread of information within the

in a self-contained tutorial fashion. Specifically, we develop neural networks
as a composition of several vector-valued functions. Although neural networks
are well-understood pictorially in terms of interconnected neurons, neural
networks are mathematical nonlinear functions constructed by composing several
vector-valued functions. Using basic results from linear algebra, we represent
a neural network as an alternating sequence of linear maps and scalar nonlinear
functions, also known as activation functions. The training of neural networks
requires the minimization of a cost function, which in turn requires the
computation of a gradient. Using basic multivariable calculus results, the cost
gradient is also shown to be a function composed of a sequence of linear maps
and nonlinear functions. In addition to the analytical gradient computation, we
consider two gradient-free training methods and compare the three training
methods in terms of convergence rate and prediction accuracy.

  Transmissibility and Pathogenesis of SARS Covid (CoV-2, CoV) and MERS Covid","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2202.11752",,,,"q-bio.OT cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Significantly higher transmissibility of SARS CoV-2 (2019) compared to SARS
CoV (2003) can be attributed to mutations of structural proteins (Spike S,
Nucleocapsid N, Membrane M, and Envelope E) and the role played by
non-structural proteins (nsps) and accessory proteins (ORFs) for viral
replication, assembly and shedding. The non-structural proteins (nsps) avail
host protein synthesis machinery to initiate viral replication, along with
neutralization of host immune defense. The key protein out of the 16 nsps, is
the non-structural protein nsp1, also known as the leader protein. Nsp1 leads
the process of hijacking host resources by blocking host translation. This
paper concentrates on the analysis of nsps of SARS covid (CoV-2, CoV) and MERS
covid based on Cellular Automata enhanced Machine Learning (CAML) model
developed for study of biological strings. This computational model compares
deviation of structure - function of CoV-2 from that of CoV employing CAML
model parameters derived out of CA evolution of amino acid chains of nsps. This
comparative analysis points to - (i) higher transmissibility of CoV-2 compared
to CoV for major nsps, and (ii) deviation of MERS covid from SARS CoV in
respect of virulence and pathogenesis. A Machine Learning (ML) framework has
been designed to map the CAML model parameters to the physical domain features
reported in in-vitro/in-vivo/in-silico experimental studies. The ML framework
enables us to learn the permissible range of model parameters derived out of
mutational study of sixteen nsps of three viruses.

  Malware Data","Accepted for publication at 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big
  Data (IEEE BigData 2022)",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cyberspace occupies a large portion of people's life in the age of modern
technology, and while there are those who utilize it for good, there are also
those who do not. Malware is an application whose construction was not
motivated by a benign goal and it can harm, steal, or even alter personal
information and secure applications and software. Thus, there are numerous
techniques to avoid malware, one of which is to develop samples of malware so
that the system can be updated with the growing number of malwares, allowing it
to recognize when malwares attempt to enter. The Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) sampling technique has been used in this study to generate new malware
samples. GANs have multiple variants, and in order to determine which variant
is optimal for a given dataset sample, their parameters must be modified. This
study employs Optuna, an autonomous hyperparameter tuning algorithm, to
determine the optimal settings for the dataset under consideration. In this
study, the architecture of the Optuna Optimized GAN (OOG) method is shown,
along with scores of 98.06%, 99.00%, 97.23%, and 98.04% for accuracy,
precision, recall and f1 score respectively. After tweaking the hyperparameters
of five supervised boosting algorithms, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Extra
Trees Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, the methodology of this
paper additionally employs the weighted ensemble technique to acquire this
result. In addition to comparing existing efforts in this domain, the study
demonstrates how promising GAN is in comparison to other sampling techniques
such as SMOTE.

surveillance, which aims to retrieve pedestrian images with high semantic
relevance to a given text description. This retrieval task is characterized
with both modal heterogeneity and fine-grained matching. To implement this
task, one needs to extract multi-scale features from both image and text
domains, and then perform the cross-modal alignment. However, most existing
approaches only consider the alignment confined at their individual scales,
e.g., an image-sentence or a region-phrase scale. Such a strategy adopts the
presumable alignment in feature extraction, while overlooking the cross-scale
alignment, e.g., image-phrase. In this paper, we present a transformer-based
model to extract multi-scale representations, and perform Asymmetric
Cross-Scale Alignment (ACSA) to precisely align the two modalities.
Specifically, ACSA consists of a global-level alignment module and an
asymmetric cross-attention module, where the former aligns an image and texts
on a global scale, and the latter applies the cross-attention mechanism to
dynamically align the cross-modal entities in region/image-phrase scales.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Codes are available at
