one of the goals our community has been pursuing recently. Although financial
technology (FinTech) is one of the popular application fields, we notice that
there is no discussion on how NLP can help in FinTech for the social good. When
mentioning FinTech for social good, people are talking about financial
inclusion and green finance. However, the role of NLP in these directions only
gets limited discussions. To fill this gap, this paper shares our idea of how
we can use NLP in FinTech for social good. We hope readers can rethink the

star via a supernova explosion but get more abundant as the proto-neutron star
cools via neutrino emissions on the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale.
  In this paper we evaluate all the relevant rates of the neutrino interactions
with muons at different times in the proto-neutron star cooling.
  We are particularly interested in the late phase ($ t \gtrsim 10
\operatorname{s}$), which will be accessible in the next Galactic supernova but
has not been studied well so far.
  We calculate both leptonic and semi-leptonic processes, for the latter of
which we pay attention also to the form factors with their dependence on the
transferred momentum as well as to the modification of the dispersion relations
for nucleons on the mean field level.
  We find that the flavor-exchange reactions $\nu_e + \mu^- \rightarrow
\nu_{\mu} + e^-$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu} + \mu^- \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e + e^-$
can be dominant, particularly at low energies, over the capture of $\nu_e$ on
neutron and the scatterings of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ on nucleons as the opacity
sources for these species and that the inverse muon decay $ \bar{\nu}_e +
\nu_{\mu} + e^- \leftrightarrows \mu^- $ can overwhelm the scatterings of
$\bar{\nu}_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}$ on nucleons again at low energies.
  At high energies, on the other hand, the corrections in the semi-leptonic
processes mentioned above are more important.
  We also show the non-trivial energy- and angular dependences of the
flavor-exchange reactions and the inverse muon decay.
  In the study of the diffusion coefficients from these reactions, we find that
$\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ is most affected.
  These pieces of information are indispensable for numerical computations and
the interpretation of results thereof for the proto-neutron star cooling
particularly at the very late phase.

its internal structure has long been a subject of debate. A recent reanalysis
of the Galileo magnetometer data suggested the presence of a high melt fraction
layer with $>$50~km thickness in the subsurface region of Io. Whether this
layer is a ``magmatic sponge'' with interconnected solid or a rheologically
liquid ``magma ocean'' would alter the distribution of tidal heating and would
also influence the interpretation of various observations. To this end, we
explore the steady state of a magmatic sponge and estimate the amount of
internal heating necessary to sustain such a layer with a high degree of
melting. Our results show that the rate of tidal dissipation within Io is
insufficient to sustain a partial melt layer of $\phi>0.2$ for a wide range of
parameters, suggesting that such a layer would swiftly separate into two
phases. Unless melt and/or solid viscosities are at the higher end of the
estimated range, a magmatic sponge would be unstable, and thus a high melt
fraction layer suggested in Khurana et al. (2011) is likely to be a subsurface
magma ocean.

We derive an approach to the study of spectral lines that is robust and

orthogonal polynomials with the peculiar mathematical properties of Hermite
functions and basic properties of the Gaia spectrophotometers. Particular use
is made of the simple computation of derivatives of linear combinations of
Hermite functions and their roots. A simple and efficient computational method
for deriving the position in wavelength, the statistical significance, and the
line strengths is presented for spectra represented by a linear combination of
Hermite functions. The derived method is fast and robust enough to be applied
to large numbers of Gaia spectra without high performance computing resources

a tracklet search optimized for shorter lifetimes by requiring only three pixel

the culture of collaboration between developers (Dev), security (Sec) and

Adopting this paradigm effectively, therefore, requires an understanding of the
challenges, best practices and available solutions for collaboration among
these functional teams. However, collaborative aspects related to these teams
have received very little empirical attention in the DevSecOps literature.
Hence, we present a study focusing on a key security activity, Application
Security Testing (AST), in which practitioners face difficulties performing
collaborative work in a DevSecOps environment. Our study made novel use of 48
systematically selected webinars, technical talks and panel discussions as a
data source to qualitatively analyse software practitioner discussions on the
most recent trends and emerging solutions in this highly evolving field. We
find that the lack of features that facilitate collaboration built into the AST
tools themselves is a key tool-related challenge in DevSecOps. In addition, the
lack of clarity related to role definitions, shared goals, and ownership also
hinders Collaborative AST (CoAST). We also captured a range of best practices
for collaboration (e.g., Shift-left security), emerging communication methods

Finally, our study identified several requirements for new tool features and

representations of brain signals and the scarcity of data annotations. In this
work, we present MinD-Vis: Sparse Masked Brain Modeling with Double-Conditioned
Latent Diffusion Model for Human Vision Decoding. Firstly, we learn an
effective self-supervised representation of fMRI data using mask modeling in a
large latent space inspired by the sparse coding of information in the primary
visual cortex. Then by augmenting a latent diffusion model with
double-conditioning, we show that MinD-Vis can reconstruct highly plausible
images with semantically matching details from brain recordings using very few
paired annotations. We benchmarked our model qualitatively and quantitatively;
the experimental results indicate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art
in both semantic mapping (100-way semantic classification) and generation
quality (FID) by 66% and 41% respectively. An exhaustive ablation study was
also conducted to analyze our framework.

non-detection of broad RRLs in Circinus galaxy at this band tells us that it is

fundamental importance to understand the functionalities of materials. One
striking example of such interaction is the intertwined coupling or competition
between superconductivity (SC), charge density wave (CDW), pseudogap state
(PG), and other exotic phases in cuprate superconductors. Recent emergence of
nonlinear Terahertz (THz) third harmonic generation (THG) spectroscopy provides
a powerful tool for exploring the collective (Higgs) modes of superconductivity
order parameters, and its interaction with intertwined/competing phases. In
this study, we report on nonlinear THz THG spectroscopy of the
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO) thin films with different doping. We identify a
characteristic temperature $T_{THG}$, below which third order suscepetility
$\chi^{(3)}$ emerges. Notably, the $T_{THG}$ is coincident with the crossover
temperature $T^*$ of pseudogap in a wide range doping of phase diagram. Upon
entering the superconducting state, THG increases sharply but exhibits an
abnormal dip feature near $T_c$ which is more clearly seen in optimally doped
sample. Strikingly, we observe a beating structure directly in the measured
real time waveform of THG signal. Fourier transformation of the time domain
waveform gives two separate modes below and above original THG frequency. The
observation strongly indicates that an additional mode, presumably Higgs mode,
appears at $T_c$ and couples to the mode already developed below $T^*$. The
strong coupling effect offers new insight into the interplay between
superconductivity and pseudogap. The result unambiguously suggests that the
pseudogap phase is not a precursor of superconductivity but represents a
distinct order.

that due to the definition of the cross correlation function, a low UV/X-ray

In particular, we examine how the variability of the geometric or physical

of the geometric configuration are found to produce a range of UV/X-ray cross
correlations, which match well the observed values, while they result in high
correlation between the UV and optical variability, reconciling the observed

However, this only occurs across a small range of Reynolds numbers and that too

by formation of vortex tubes in the flow. Interestingly enough, such T-shaped

this trapping phenomenon can emerge in such geometries as well. Our current
model simulates the occurrence with water as the ambient fluid medium passing

each of the arms of the junction. In our study, we have conducted the
investigation using a Reynolds number of 400 that lies in the laminar regime

processes are the so-called attachment rate $g^{+}$ and the detachment rate
$g^{-}$, which determine how particles change their belonging from one phase to
another. In the present study, a {\it correspondence rule} between the rates
$g^{+}$ and $g^{-}$ as functions of the size $N$ of growing crystalline nuclei
is defined for the first time. In contrast to the well-known detailed balance
condition, which relates $g^{+}(N)$ and $g^{-}(N)$ at $N=n_c$ (where $n_c$ is
the critical nucleus size) and is satisfied only at the beginning of the
nucleation regime, the found {\it correspondence rule} is fulfilled at all the
main stages of crystallization kinetics (crystal nucleation, growth and
coalescence). On the example of crystallizing supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid,
the rate $g^{-}$ was calculated for the first time at different supercooling
levels and for the wide range of nucleus sizes $N\in[n_c;\,40\,n_c]$. It was
found that for the whole range of nucleus sizes, the detachment rate $g^{-}$ is
only $\approx2$\% less than the attachment rate $g^{+}$. This is direct
evidence that the role of the processes that counteract crystallization remains
significant at all the stages of crystallization. Based on the obtained
results, a kinetic equation was formulated for the time-dependent distribution
function of the nucleus sizes, that is an alternative to the well-known kinetic

records in one or more relational tables that refer to the same entity in the
real world. Supervised machine learning (ML) models currently achieve
state-of-the-art matching performance; however, they require many labeled
examples, which are often expensive or infeasible to obtain. This has inspired
us to approach data labeling for EM using weak supervision. In particular, we
use the labeling function abstraction popularized by Snorkel, where each
labeling function (LF) is a user-provided program that can generate many noisy
match/non-match labels quickly and cheaply. Given a set of user-written LFs,
the quality of data labeling depends on a labeling model to accurately infer
the ground-truth labels. In this work, we first propose a simple but powerful
labeling model for general weak supervision tasks. Then, we tailor the labeling
model specifically to the task of entity matching by considering the
EM-specific transitivity property.
  The general form of our labeling model is simple while substantially
outperforming the best existing method across ten general weak supervision
datasets. To tailor the labeling model for EM, we formulate an approach to
ensure that the final predictions of the labeling model satisfy the
transitivity property required in EM, utilizing an exact solution where
possible and an ML-based approximation in remaining cases. On two single-table
and nine two-table real-world EM datasets, we show that our labeling model
results in a 9% higher F1 score on average than the best existing method. We
also show that a deep learning EM end model (DeepMatcher) trained on labels
generated from our weak supervision approach is comparable to an end model
trained using tens of thousands of ground-truth labels, demonstrating that our
approach can significantly reduce the labeling efforts required in EM.

with the modern language of quantum mechanics. In fact, the density operator
plays a role similar to that of probability distribution functions in classical
probability theory and statistics. However, the use of the probability
distribution functions in classical theories is founded on premises that seem
intuitively clear enough. Whereas in quantum theory, the situation with
operators is different due to its non-commutativity nature. By exploiting this
difference, quantum estimation theory aims to attain ultra-measurement
precision that would otherwise be impossible with classical resources. In this
thesis, we reviewed all the fundamental principles of classical estimation
theory. Next, we extend our analysis to quantum estimation theory. Due to the
non-commutativity of quantum mechanics, we prove the different families of QFIs
and the corresponding QCRBs. We compared these bounds and discussed their
accessibility in the single-parameter and multiparameter estimation cases. We
also introduce HCRB as the most informative alternative bound suitable for
multiparameter estimation protocols. Since the quantum state of light is the
most accessible in practice, we studied the quantum estimation theory with the
formalism of these types of quantum states. We formulate, with complete
generality, the quantum estimation theory for Gaussian states in terms of their
first and second moments. Furthermore, we address the motivation behind using
Gaussian quantum resources and their advantages in reaching the standard
quantum limits under realistic noise. In this context, we propose and analyze a
measurement scheme that aims to exploit quantum Gaussian entangled states to
estimate the displacement parameters under a noisy Gaussian environment.

  (Complete Version)",,,,,"cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Real-time fraud detection is a challenge for most financial and electronic
commercial platforms. To identify fraudulent communities, Grab, one of the
largest technology companies in Southeast Asia, forms a graph from a set of
transactions and detects dense subgraphs arising from abnormally large numbers
of connections among fraudsters. Existing dense subgraph detection approaches
focus on static graphs without considering the fact that transaction graphs are
highly dynamic. Moreover, detecting dense subgraphs from scratch with graph
updates is time consuming and cannot meet the real-time requirement in
industry. To address this problem, we introduce an incremental real-time fraud
detection framework called Spade. Spade can detect fraudulent communities in
hundreds of microseconds on million-scale graphs by incrementally maintaining
dense subgraphs. Furthermore, Spade supports batch updates and edge grouping to
reduce response latency. Lastly, Spade provides simple but expressive APIs for
the design of evolving fraud detection semantics. Developers plug their
customized suspiciousness functions into Spade which incrementalizes their
semantics without recasting their algorithms. Extensive experiments show that
Spade detects fraudulent communities in real time on million-scale graphs.
Peeling algorithms incrementalized by Spade are up to a million times faster
than the static version.

perturbative and non-perturbative transport coefficients of HQ. This solicits a
comprehensive theoretical framework accommodating the non-perturbative Quantum
Chromo Dynamics(npQCD) description alongside perturbative QCD(pQCD). The
present work provides such a formulation in which HQ-anti quark potential in
the hot and magnetic QCD medium is implemented as an effective gluon propagator
to calculate the rate of elastic scattering between HQ and the light quarks and
gluons inside a medium of hot Quark Gluon Plasma(QGP) in the presence of a
strong but uniform magnetic field. Diffusion coefficients of a charm quark have
been computed for a short-range Yukawa potential ( pQCD) as well as a
long-range confining potential (npQCD) for the scenarios where the velocity of
the charm quark is parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field
respectively. Non-perturbative contribution is seen to dominate over the
perturbative one in the regime of low temperatures and low momenta of charm

energy-efficient framework called GreenPLM that uses bilingual lexicons to
directly ""translate"" pre-trained language models of one language into another
at almost no additional cost. We validate this approach in 18 languages' BERT
models and show that this framework is comparable to, if not better than, other
heuristics with high training costs. In addition, given lightweight continued
pre-training on limited data where available, this framework outperforms the
original monolingual language models in six out of seven tested languages with
up to 200x less pre-training efforts. Aiming at the Leave No One Behind
Principle (LNOB), our approach manages to reduce inequalities between languages
and energy consumption greatly. We make our codes and models publicly available

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital
converters. Learning-based detection does not need to estimate channels, which
overcomes a key drawback in one-bit quantized systems. During training,
learning-based detection suffers at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because
observations will be biased to +1 or -1 which leads to many zero-valued
empirical likelihood functions. At low SNR, observations vary frequently in
value but the high noise power makes capturing the effect of the channel
difficult. To address these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive
dithering-and-learning method. During training, received values are mixed with
dithering noise whose statistics are known to the base station, and the
dithering noise power is updated for each antenna element depending on the
observed pattern of the output. We then use the refined probabilities in the
one-bit maximum likelihood detection rule. Simulation results validate the
detection performance of the proposed method vs. our previous method using
fixed dithering noise power as well as zero-forcing and optimal ML detection
both of which assume perfect channel knowledge.

both control and target photons within an atomic ensemble using non-Rydberg

such that the number of disagreements with these recommendations is minimized.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of correlation clustering for dynamic
complete signed graphs where (1) a vertex can be added or deleted, and (2) the
sign of an edge can be flipped. In the proposed online scheme, the offline
approximation algorithm in [CALM+21] for correlation clustering is used. Up to
the author's knowledge, this is the first online algorithm for dynamic graphs
which allows a full set of graph editing operations.
  The proposed approach is rigorously analyzed and compared with a baseline
method, which runs the original offline algorithm on each time step. Our
results show that the dynamic operations have local effects on the neighboring
vertices and we employ this locality to reduce the dependency of the running
time in the Baseline to the summation of the degree of all vertices in $G_t$,
the graph after applying the graph edit operation at time step $t$, to the
summation of the degree of the changing vertices (e.g. two endpoints of an
edge) and the number of clusters in the previous time step. Moreover, the
required working memory is reduced to the square of the summation of the degree
of the modified edge endpoints rather than the total number of vertices in the

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac3614",,"gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Tidal interactions in coalescing binary neutron stars modify the dynamics of
the inspiral and hence imprint a signature on their gravitational wave (GW)
signals in the form of an extra phase shift. We need accurate models for the
tidal phase shift in order to constrain the supranuclear equation of state from
observations. In previous studies, GW waveform models were typically
constructed by treating the tide as a linear response to a perturbing tidal
field. In this work, we incorporate non-linear corrections due to hydrodynamic
three- and four-mode interactions and show how they can improve the accuracy
and explanatory power of waveform models. We set up and numerically solve the
coupled differential equations for the orbit and the modes and analytically
derive solutions of the system's equilibrium configuration. Our analytical
solutions agree well with the numerical ones up to the merger and involve only
algebraic relations, allowing for fast phase shift and waveform evaluations for
different equations of state over a large parameter space. We find that, at
Newtonian order, non-linear fluid effects can enhance the tidal phase shift by
$\gtrsim 1\,{\rm radian}$ at a GW frequency of 1000 Hz, corresponding to a
$10-20\%$ correction to the linear theory. The scale of the additional phase
shift near the merger is consistent with the difference between numerical
relativity and theoretical predictions that account only for the linear tide.
Non-linear fluid effects are thus important when interpreting the results of
numerical relativity and in the construction of waveform models for current and
future GW detectors.

sliding affects the interlayer hopping, which induces a splitting between
bonding and anti-bonding bands. When this splitting is large, the AA and AB
stacking configurations correspond to the global and secondary minima,
respectively, and these configurations are separated by a barrier against
layer-sliding. While chemical doping only flattens this barrier, strong
\emph{photodoping} from bonding to antibonding bands can transiently
destabilize the global minimum and induce a sliding motion toward the AB

space-like hypersurfaces $\{M_t\}_{t\in \mathbb{R}}$, which are orthogonal to a
family of co-moving observers defined by a global time-like vector field $U$.
In particular, this implies such space-times satisfy several of the well-known
criteria for isotropic cosmological space-times, although, in the family in
question, the simultaneity-spaces $(M_t,g_t)$ associated to $U$ can have as
sectional curvature a sign-changing function $k(t)$. Being this clearly
impossible in the FLRW family of standard cosmological space-times, it
motivates us to revisit the geometric rigidity consequences of different
definitions of isotropy available in the literature. In this analysis, we
divide such definition according to whether the isometries involved are taken
to be (local) space-time (STI space-times) or (local) space isometries (SI
space-times) of $(M_t,g_t)$ for each $t$. This subtlety will be shown to be
critical, proving that only when space-time isometries are considered one
obtains the well-known rigidity properties associated with isotropic
cosmological space-times. In particular SI space-times will be shown to be a
strictly larger class than the STI ones, allowing a family of basic
cosmological curvature change models which are not even locally isometric to

correspond to two different branches of the dispersion law of the Manakov
system in the presence of the unstable background. Then we investigate the key
interaction scenarios, including collisions of standing and moving breathers
and resonance breather transformations. Analysis of the two-breather solution
allows us to derive general formulas describing phase and space shifts acquired
by breathers in mutual collisions. The found expressions enable us to describe
the asymptotic states of the breather interactions and interpret the resonance
fusion and decay of breathers as a limiting case of infinite space shift in the

probability and the quality of the in-constraint solution by adding a penalty
for constraint violation into the objective. We propose a new approach for
solving constrained optimization problems with unconstrained, easy-to-implement

and adds a lower-bound constraint on the in-constraint probability to the

cobordism interpolate between two topologically distinct manifolds. On the
other hand, Cartier and DeWitt-Morette have given a rigorous definition for
quantum field theories (qfts) by means of path integrals. This article uses
their results to study whether qfts can be made compatible with topology
changes. We show that path integrals over metrics need a finite norm for the
latter and for degenerate metrics, this problem can sometimes be resolved with
tetrads. We prove that already in the neighborhood of some cuspidal
singularities, difficulties can arise to define certain qfts. On the other
hand, we show that simple qfts can be defined around conical singularities that
result from a topology change in a simple setup. We argue that the ground state
of many theories of quantum gravity will imply a small cosmological constant
and, during the expansion of the universe, frequent topology changes.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to describe the transition amplitudes
consistently due to the aforementioned problems. We argue that one needs to
describe qfts by stochastic differential equations, and in the case of gravity,
by Regge calculus in order to resolve this problem.

computer vision algorithms for the automated training of surgeons and the
analysis of surgical footage. By estimating 2D hand poses, we model the
movement of the practitioner's hands, and their interaction with surgical
instruments, to study their potential benefit for surgical training.
  Methods: We leverage pre-trained models on a publicly-available hands dataset
to create our own in-house dataset of 100 open surgery simulation videos with
2D hand poses. We also assess the ability of pose estimations to segment
surgical videos into gestures and tool-usage segments and compare them to
kinematic sensors and I3D features. Furthermore, we introduce 6 novel surgical
dexterity proxies stemming from domain experts' training advice, all of which
our framework can automatically detect given raw video footage.
  Results: State-of-the-art gesture segmentation accuracy of 88.35\% on the
Open Surgery Simulation dataset is achieved with the fusion of 2D poses and I3D
features from multiple angles. The introduced surgical skill proxies presented
significant differences for novices compared to experts and produced actionable

  Conclusion: This research demonstrates the benefit of pose estimations for
open surgery by analyzing their effectiveness in gesture segmentation and skill
assessment. Gesture segmentation using pose estimations achieved comparable
results to physical sensors while being remote and markerless. Surgical
dexterity proxies that rely on pose estimation proved they can be used to work
towards automated training feedback. We hope our findings encourage additional
collaboration on novel skill proxies to make surgical training more efficient.

combines the transaction demand by the consumers and the supply of hashrate by
miners. We argue that the decreasing block reward will have no significant
effect on the exchange rate (price) of Bitcoin and thus the network will be
transitioning to a regime where transaction fees will play a bigger part of
miners' revenue. We consider a simple model where consumers demand bitcoins for
transactions, but not for hoarding bitcoins, and we analyze market equilibrium
where the demand is matched with the hashrate supplied by miners. Our main
conclusion is that the exchange rate of Bitcoin cannot be determined from the
market equilibrium and so our arguments support the hypothesis that Bitcoin
price has no economic fundamentals and is free to fluctuate according to the
present demand for hoarding and speculation. We point out that increasing fees
bear the risk of Bitcoin being outcompeted by its main rival Ethereum, and that
decreasing revenues to miners depreciate the perception of Bitcoin as a medium
for store value (hoarding demand) which will have effect its exchange rate.

high-speed schlieren near the critical conditions of diffraction. The critical
initial pressure for successful diffraction is reported for the ethylene,

portion of the wave results in a zone of quenched ignition. The dynamics of the
laterally diffracting shock front are found in good agreement with the recent
model developed by Radulescu et al. (Physics of Fluids 2021). The model
provides noticeable improvement over the local models using Whitham's
characteristic rule and Wescott, Bdzil and Stewart's model for weakly curved
reactive shocks. These models provide a link between the critical channel
height and the critical wave curvature. The critical channel heights and global
curvatures are found in very good agreement with the critical curvatures
measured independently by Xiao and Radulescu (Combust. Flame 2020) in
quasi-steady experiments in exponential horns for three mixtures tested.
Furthermore, critical curvature data obtained by others in the literature was
found to provide a good prediction of critical diffraction in 2D. These
findings suggest that the critical diffraction of unstable detonations may be
well predicted by a model based on the maximum curvature of the detonation
front, where the latter is to be measured experimentally and account for the
role of the cellular structure in the burning mechanism. This finding provides
support to the view that models for unstable detonations at a meso-scale larger
than the cell size, i.e., hydrodynamic average models, are meaningful.

based on the framework of critical phenomena in physics, is presented. The
first step consists of constructing a simple mean-behaviour model and applying
it to a strike process in a plant. The model comprises only a limited number of
parameters characteristic of the plant considered and of the society. A
dissatisfaction function is introduced with a basic principle stating that the
stable state of the plant is a state, which minimizes this function. It is
found that the plant can be in one of two phases: the ""collective phase"" and
the ""individual phase"". These two phases are separated by a critical point, in
the neighbourhood of which the system is very sensitive to small changes in the
parameters. The collective phase includes a region of parameters for which the
system has two possible states: a ""work state"" and a ""strike state"". The actual
state of the system depends on the parameters and on the ""history of the
system"". The irreversibility of the transition between these two states
indicates the existence of metastable states. For these particular states, the
effect of small groups of workers or of a small perturbation in the system
results in drastic changes in the state of the plant. Other non-trivial
implications of the model, as well as possible extensions and refinements of
the approach, are discussed.

directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): if $G$ is a weighted DAG such that for each
subset $S$ of 3 nodes there is a shortest path containing every node in $S$,
then there exists a pair $(s,t)$ of nodes such that there is a shortest
$st$-path containing every node in $G$.
  We extend this theorem to general graphs. For undirected graphs, we prove
that the same theorem holds (up to a difference in the constant 3). For
directed graphs, we provide a counterexample to the theorem (for any constant),
and prove a roundtrip analogue of the theorem which shows there exists a pair
$(s,t)$ of nodes such that every node in $G$ is contained in the union of a
shortest $st$-path and a shortest $ts$-path.
  The original theorem for DAGs has an application to the $k$-Shortest Paths
with Congestion $c$ (($k,c$)-SPC) problem. In this problem, we are given a
weighted graph $G$, together with $k$ node pairs $(s_1,t_1),\dots,(s_k,t_k)$,
and a positive integer $c\leq k$. We are tasked with finding paths $P_1,\dots,
P_k$ such that each $P_i$ is a shortest path from $s_i$ to $t_i$, and every
node in the graph is on at most $c$ paths $P_i$, or reporting that no such
collection of paths exists.
  When $c=k$ the problem is easily solved by finding shortest paths for each
pair $(s_i,t_i)$ independently. When $c=1$, the $(k,c)$-SPC problem recovers
the $k$-Disjoint Shortest Paths ($k$-DSP) problem, where the collection of
shortest paths must be node-disjoint. For fixed $k$, $k$-DSP can be solved in
polynomial time on DAGs and undirected graphs. Previous work shows that the
local-to-global theorem for DAGs implies that $(k,c)$-SPC on DAGs whenever
$k-c$ is constant. In the same way, our work implies that $(k,c)$-SPC can be
solved in polynomial time on undirected graphs whenever $k-c$ is constant.

changes in mechanical, optical, or electrical properties offer a unique
advantage in designing and creating new dynamically functional components for
sensing, micro-actuation, colour changes, information, and mass transport. To
harness the vast potential of soft solids, a thorough understanding of their
reactions when exposed to liquids is needed. Attempts to study the interactions
between soft solids and liquids have largely focused on the wetting of soft
solids and its resulting deformation at equilibrium or in a quasi-static state.
Here, we consider the frequently encountered case of unsteady wetting of a
liquid on a soft solid and show that transient deformation of the solid is
necessary to understand unsteady wetting behaviours. We find that the initial
spreading of the liquid occurs uninterrupted in the absence of solid
deformation. This is followed by intermittent spreading, in which transient
deformation of the solid at the three-phase contact line (CL) causes the CL
motion to alternate alternation between CL sticking and slipping. We identify
the spreading rate of liquids and the viscoelastic reacting rate of soft solids
as the two competing factors in dictating intermittent spreading. We formulate
and validate experimentally the conditions required for the contact line to
transition from sticking to slipping. By considering the growing deformation of
soft solids as dynamic surface heterogeneities, our proposed conditions for
stick-slip transition in unsteady wetting on soft solids broaden the classical
theory on wetting hysteresis on rigid solids.

bounded from below, by a non-border complexity measure. This task is at the
heart of understanding the difference between Valiant's determinant vs
permanent conjecture, and Mulmuley and Sohoni's Geometric Complexity Theory
(GCT) approach to settle the P \neq NP conjecture. Currently, very few
de-bordering results are known.
  In this work, we study the question of de-bordering the border Waring rank of
polynomials. Waring and border Waring rank are very well studied measures, in
the context of invariant theory, algebraic geometry and matrix multiplication
algorithms. For the first time, we obtain a Waring rank upper bound that is
exponential in the border Waring rank and only *linear* in the degree. All
previous results were known to be exponential in the degree.
  According to Kumar's recent surprising result (ToCT'20), a small border
Waring rank implies that the polynomial can be approximated as a sum of a
constant and a small product of linear polynomials. We prove the converse of
Kumar's result, and in this way we de-border Kumar's complexity, and obtain a
new formulation of border Waring rank, up to a factor of the degree. We phrase
this new formulation as the orbit closure problem of the product-plus-power
polynomial, and we successfully de-border this orbit closure. We fully
implement the GCT approach against the power sum, and we generalize the ideas
of Ikenmeyer-Kandasamy (STOC'20) to this new orbit closure. In this way, we
obtain new multiplicity obstructions that are constructed from just the
symmetries of the points and representation theoretic branching rules, rather
than explicit multilinear computations.
  Furthermore, we realize that the generalization of our converse of Kumar's
theorem to square matrices gives a homogeneous formulation of Ben-Or and Cleve

  Additive Combinatorics","Abstract shortened to fit arXiv requirements",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The ""short cycle removal"" technique was recently introduced by Abboud,
Bringmann, Khoury and Zamir (STOC '22) to prove fine-grained hardness of
approximation. Its main technical result is that listing all triangles in an
$n^{1/2}$-regular graph is $n^{2-o(1)}$-hard under the 3-SUM conjecture even
when the number of short cycles is small; namely, when the number of $k$-cycles
is $O(n^{k/2+\gamma})$ for $\gamma<1/2$.
  Abboud et al. achieve $\gamma\geq 1/4$ by applying structure vs. randomness
arguments on graphs. In this paper, we take a step back and apply conceptually
similar arguments on the numbers of the 3-SUM problem. Consequently, we achieve
the best possible $\gamma=0$ and the following lower bounds under the 3-SUM
conjecture:
  * Approximate distance oracles: The seminal Thorup-Zwick distance oracles
achieve stretch $2k\pm O(1)$ after preprocessing a graph in $O(m n^{1/k})$
time. For the same stretch, and assuming the query time is $n^{o(1)}$ Abboud et
al. proved an $\Omega(m^{1+\frac{1}{12.7552 \cdot k}})$ lower bound on the
preprocessing time; we improve it to $\Omega(m^{1+\frac1{2k}})$ which is only a
factor 2 away from the upper bound. We also obtain tight bounds for stretch
$2+o(1)$ and $3-\epsilon$ and higher lower bounds for dynamic shortest paths.
  * Listing 4-cycles: Abboud et al. proved the first super-linear lower bound
for listing all 4-cycles in a graph, ruling out $(m^{1.1927}+t)^{1+o(1)}$ time
algorithms where $t$ is the number of 4-cycles. We settle the complexity of
this basic problem by showing that the $\widetilde{O}(\min(m^{4/3},n^2) +t)$
upper bound is tight up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors.
  Our results exploit a rich tool set from additive combinatorics, most notably
the Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem and Rusza's covering lemma. A key
ingredient that may be of independent interest is a subquadratic algorithm for
3-SUM if one of the sets has small doubling.

characteristics depending on whether the Horndeski coupling parameter $\gamma$

the strength of the momentum dissipation $\hat{k}$, the doping $\chi$ and the
coupling between two gauge fields $\theta$. Secondly, we demonstrate that the
thermal conductivities are affected not only by the inherent properties of the
black hole, but also by the model parameters. Furthermore, we are particularly
interested in the Lorentz ratios' properties. As expected, the Wiedemann-Franz

Particularly intriguing is the fact that several Lorentz ratio bounds reported
in the typical axions model still remain true in our current theories. We would

affected by the system parameters $\chi$, $\theta$ and $\gamma$, which differs

learning (QML) that capitalizes on inherent system dynamics. As a result, QNC
can run on contemporary, noisy quantum hardware and is poised to realize
challenging algorithms in the near term. One key element yet to be added to QNC
is the characterization of the requisite dynamics for universal quantum
neuromorphic computation. We address this issue by proposing a quantum
equivalent to the classical perceptron, a simple mathematical model for a
neuron that is the building block of various machine learning architectures. We
introduce a quantum perceptron (QP) based on the analog dynamics of interacting
qubits with tunable coupling constants. By adding tunable single-qubit
rotations to the QP, we demonstrate that a QP can realize universal quantum
computation, which contrasts sharply with the limited computational complexity
of a single classical perceptron. We show that QPs are analogous to variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs) familiar to the quantum machine learning community.
We derive the quantum neural tangent kernel of a QP and compare the QP's
trainability to the trainability of other VQAs. We discuss the advantages and
drawbacks of kernel formalism. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of QPs
by applying them to numerous QML problems, including calculating the inner
products between quantum states, entanglement witnessing, and quantum

scenes and objects into part-whole hierarchies. Although deep neural networks
have the capability of learning powerful multi-level representations, they can
not explicitly model part-whole hierarchies, which limits their expressiveness
and interpretability in processing 3D vision data such as point clouds. To this
end, we propose an encoder-decoder style latent variable model that explicitly
learns the part-whole hierarchies for the multi-level point cloud segmentation.
Specifically, the encoder takes a point cloud as input and predicts the
per-point latent subpart distribution at the middle level. The decoder takes
the latent variable and the feature from the encoder as an input and predicts
the per-point part distribution at the top level. During training, only
annotated part labels at the top level are provided, thus making the whole
framework weakly supervised. We explore two kinds of approximated inference
algorithms, i.e., most-probable-latent and Monte Carlo methods, and three
stochastic gradient estimations for learning discrete latent variables, i.e.,
straight-through, REINFORCE, and pathwise estimators. Experimental results on
the PartNet dataset show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art

Previous semi-supervised 3D object detection methods directly follow the

propose to solve two fundamental challenges to push the horizon of Binary
Vision Transformers (BiViT). First, the traditional binary method does not take

large binarization errors in the attention module. To solve this, we propose
Softmax-aware Binarization, which dynamically adapts to the data distribution

survey data from the Wide-field ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind Survey
(WALLABY) on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder. Phase 1 of the
WALLABY pilot survey targeted three $60~{\rm deg}^2$ regions on the sky in the
direction of the Hydra and Norma galaxy clusters and the NGC 4636 galaxy group,
covering the redshift range of z < 0.08. The source catalogue, images and
spectra of nearly 600 extragalactic HI detections and kinematic models for 109
spatially resolved galaxies are available. As the pilot survey targeted regions
containing nearby group and cluster environments, the median redshift of the
sample of z ~ 0.014 is relatively low compared to the full WALLABY survey. The
median galaxy HI mass is $2.3 \times 10^{9}~M_{\odot}$. The target noise level
of 1.6 mJy per $30''$ beam and 18.5 kHz channel translates into a $5\sigma$ HI
mass sensitivity for point sources of about $5.2 \times 10^{8} \, (D_{\rm L} /
\mathrm{100~Mpc})^{2} \, M_{\odot}$ across 50 spectral channels (~200 km/s) and
a $5\sigma$ HI column density sensitivity of about $8.6 \times 10^{19} \, (1 +
z)^{4}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ across 5 channels (~20 km/s) for emission filling the
$30''$ beam. As expected for a pilot survey, several technical issues and
artefacts are still affecting the data quality. Most notably, there are
systematic flux errors of up to several 10% caused by uncertainties about the
exact size and shape of each of the primary beams as well as the presence of
sidelobes due to the finite deconvolution threshold. In addition, artefacts
such as residual continuum emission and bandpass ripples have affected some of
the data. The pilot survey has been highly successful in uncovering such
technical problems, most of which are expected to be addressed and rectified
before the start of the full WALLABY survey.

sensing (CSS) via block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm, for
achieving high sensing accuracy in real time. These schemes aim to reliably
recover the spectrum by adaptively adjusting the number of required
measurements without inducing unnecessary sampling redundancy. To this end, the
minimum number of required measurements for successful recovery is first
derived in terms of its probabilistic lower bound. Then, a CSS scheme is
proposed by tightening the derived lower bound, where the key is the design of
a nonlinear exponential indicator through a general-purpose sampling-controlled
algorithm (SCA). In particular, a sampling-controlled BOMP (SC-BOMP) is
developed through a holistic integration of the existing BOMP and the proposed
SCA. For fast implementation, a modified version of SC-BOMP is further
developed by exploring the block orthogonality in the form of sub-coherence of
measurement matrices, which allows more compressive sampling in terms of
smaller lower bound of the number of measurements. Such a fast SC-BOMP scheme
achieves a desired tradeoff between the complexity and the performance.
Simulations demonstrate that the two SC-BOMP schemes outperform the other
benchmark algorithms.

applications. Existing works on bilevel optimization mostly consider either
unconstrained problems or constrained upper-level problems. This paper
considers the stochastic bilevel optimization problems with equality
constraints both in the upper and lower levels. By leveraging the special
structure of the equality constraints problem, the paper first presents an
alternating implicit projected SGD approach and establishes the $\tilde{\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity that matches the state-of-the-art
complexity of ALSET \citep{chen2021closing} for unconstrained bilevel problems.
To further save the cost of projection, the paper presents two alternating
implicit projection-efficient SGD approaches, where one algorithm enjoys the
$\tilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-2}/T)$ upper-level and $\tilde{\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-1.5}/T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ lower-level projection complexity with
${\cal O}(T)$ lower-level batch size, and the other one enjoys $\tilde{\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ upper-level and lower-level projection complexity with
${\cal O}(1)$ batch size. Application to federated bilevel optimization has
been presented to showcase the empirical performance of our algorithms. Our
results demonstrate that equality-constrained bilevel optimization with
strongly-convex lower-level problems can be solved as efficiently as stochastic
single-level optimization problems.

(A-WENO) schemes for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The new schemes
employ the recently proposed local characteristic decomposition based
central-upwind numerical fluxes, the three-stage third-order strong stability
preserving Runge-Kutta time integrator, and the fifth-order WENO-Z
interpolation. The adaptive strategy is implemented by applying the limited
interpolation only in the parts of the computational domain where the solution
is identified as ``rough'' with the help of a smoothness indicator. We develop
and use a new simple and robust local smoothness indicator (LSI), which is
applied to the solutions computed at each of the three stages of the ODE
solver.
  The new LSI and adaptive A-WENO schemes are tested on the Euler equations of
gas dynamics. We implement the proposed LSI using the pressure, which remains
smooth at contact discontinuities, while our goal is to detect other ``rough''
areas and apply the limited interpolation mostly in the neighborhoods of the
shock waves. We demonstrate that the new adaptive schemes are highly accurate,
non-oscillatory, and robust. They outperform their fully limited counterparts
(the A-WENO schemes with the same numerical fluxes and ODE solver but with the
WENO-Z interpolation employed everywhere) while being less computationally

enhanced or diminished with increasing magnetic field strength, which should be
caused by different heating effects in magnetic flux tubes with different

images, which can be classified into two types. One type is located in the
quiet-Sun regions without magnetic fields. The other type, which has rarely
been reported in the past, is near or surrounded by magnetic fields. Notably,
some are located at the edge of the magnetic network. The two kinds of cold
bubbles and the relationship between cold bubble intensities and network

RecSys. However, the majority of these approaches have three limitations: (1)
treat the collaborative knowledge graph as a homogeneous graph and overlook the
highly heterogeneous relationships among items, (2) lack of design to
explicitly leverage the rich side information, and (3) overlook the rich
knowledge in user preference. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the
rich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced
recommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender
System (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous
semantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs
to explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of
meta-knowledge. In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user
knowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The
constructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph
and user preference. Furthermore. we utilize a light convolution encoder to
recursively integrate the item relationship in each collaborative Meta-KGs.
This scheme allows us to explicitly gather the heterogeneous semantic
relationships among items and encode them into the representations of items. In
addition, we propose channel attention to fuse the item and user
representations from different Meta-KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted on
four real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant gains over the

However, this is a challenging task due to incomplete annotations and the
differential expression of transcripts across cell-types, tissues, and

by considering local splicing events, but these methods lose transcript-level
splicing information and may conflate transcripts. We develop the first
probabilistic model that reconciles the transcript and local splicing
perspectives. First, we formalize the sequence of mRNA excisions (SME)
reconstruction problem, which aims to assemble variable-length sequences of
mRNA excisions from RNA-sequencing data. We then present a novel hierarchical
Bayesian admixture model for the Reconstruction of Excised mRNA (BREM). BREM
interpolates between local splicing events and full-length transcripts and thus
focuses only on SMEs that have high posterior probability. We develop posterior
inference algorithms based on Gibbs sampling and local search of independent

is achieved via Doppler cooling and forced evaporation for $^4$He*, and
sympathetically cooling $^3$He* with $^4$He*. We discuss our simplified
implementation, along with the high versatility of our system. This technique
is able to produce a degenerate Fermi gas with a minimum reduced temperature of
$T/T_F=0.14(1)$, consisting of $2.5 \times 10^4$ $^3$He* atoms. Due to the high
internal energy of both isotopes single atom detection is possible, opening the
possibility of a large number of experiments into Bose-Fermi mixtures.

Bernard Koopman in 1931, have been employed as a powerful tool for research in
various scientific domains, such as ergodic theory, probability theory,
geometry, and topology. The current use of Koopman operators mainly focuses on
the characterization of spectral properties of ergodic dynamical systems. In
this paper, we step forward from unforced dynamical systems to control systems
and establish a systematic Koopman control framework. Specifically, we
rigorously derive a differential equation system governing the dynamics of the
Koopman operator associated with a control system, and show that the resulting
system is a bilinear system evolving on an infinite-dimensional Lie group,
which directly leads to a global bilinearization of control-affine systems.
Then, by integrating techniques in geometric control theory with
infinite-dimensional differential geometry, this further offers a two-fold
benefit to controllability analysis: the characterization of controllability
for control-affine systems in terms of de Rham differential operators and the
extension of the Lie algebra rank condition to infinite-dimensional systems. To
demonstrate the applicability, we further adopt the established framework to
develop the Koopman feedback linearization technique, which, as one of the
advantages, waives the controllability requirement for the systems to be
linearized by using the classical feedback linearization technique. In
addition, it is worth mentioning that a distinctive feature of this work is the
maximum utilization of the intrinsic algebraic and geometric properties of
Koopman operators, instead of spectral methods and the ergodicity assumption of
systems, which further demonstrate a significant advantage of our work and a
substantial difference between the presented and existing research into Koopman
operators.

  hierarchical models: How estimates depend on hyperparameters","31 pages, 12 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, like all Bayesian methods, depends on
prior assumptions. These assumptions are often chosen to promote specific
features in the recovered estimate. The form of the chosen prior determines the
shape of the posterior distribution, thus the behavior of the estimator and
complexity of the associated optimization problem. Here, we consider a family
of Gaussian hierarchical models with generalized gamma hyperpriors designed to
promote sparsity in linear inverse problems. By varying the hyperparameters, we
move continuously between priors that act as smoothed $\ell_p$ penalties with
flexible $p$, smoothing, and scale. We then introduce a predictor-corrector
method that tracks MAP solution paths as the hyperparameters vary. Path
following allows a user to explore the space of possible MAP solutions and to
test the sensitivity of solutions to changes in the prior assumptions. By
tracing paths from a convex region to a non-convex region, the user can find
local minimizers in strongly sparsity promoting regimes that are consistent
with a convex relaxation derived using related prior assumptions. We show
experimentally that these solutions. are less error prone than direct
optimization of the non-convex problem.

Moreover, using the definition of the turning number for the polymer inside the

widely used for various tasks. Different from widely studied instance-level
contrastive learning, pixel-wise contrastive learning mainly helps with
pixel-wise tasks such as medical landmark detection. The counterpart to an
instance in instance-level CL is a pixel, along with its neighboring context,
in pixel-wise CL. Aiming to build better feature representation, there is a
vast literature about designing instance augmentation strategies for
instance-level CL; but there is little similar work on pixel augmentation for
pixel-wise CL with a pixel granularity. In this paper, we attempt to bridge
this gap. We first classify a pixel into three categories, namely low-,
medium-, and high-informative, based on the information quantity the pixel
contains. Inspired by the ``InfoMin"" principle, we then design separate
augmentation strategies for each category in terms of augmentation intensity
and sampling ratio. Extensive experiments validate that our information-guided
pixel augmentation strategy succeeds in encoding more discriminative
representations and surpassing other competitive approaches in unsupervised
local feature matching. Furthermore, our pretrained model improves the
performance of both one-shot and fully supervised models. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to propose a pixel augmentation method with a pixel
granularity for enhancing unsupervised pixel-wise contrastive learning.

signal-processing systems (e.g. radio and radar) are built. Signals in the
electromagnetic spectrum extend over all timescales/frequencies and are used to
transmit and receive very long or very short pulses of very narrow or very wide
bandwidth. Time/Frequency agility is the key for optimal spectrum utilization
(i.e. to suppress interference and enhance propagation) and low-pass filtering
is the low-level digital mechanism for manoeuvre in this domain. By increasing
and decreasing the bandwidth of a low-pass filter, thus decreasing and
increasing its pulse duration, the engineer may shift energy concentration
between frequency and time. Simple processes for engineering such components
are described and explained below. These lecture notes are part of a short
course that is intended to help recent engineering graduates design low-pass
digital filters for this purpose, who have had some exposure to the topic
during their studies, and who are now interested in the sending and receiving
signals over the electromagnetic spectrum, in wireless communication (i.e.
radio) and remote sensing (e.g. radar) applications, for instance. The best way
to understand the material is to interact with the spectrum using receivers and
or transmitters and software-defined radio development-kits provide a
convenient platform for experimentation. Fortunately, wireless communication in
the radio-frequency spectrum is an ideal application for the illustration of
waveform agility in the electromagnetic spectrum. In Parts I and II, the
theoretical foundations of digital low-pass filters are presented, i.e.
signals-and-systems theory, then in Part III they are applied to the problem of
radio communication and used to concentrate energy in time or frequency.

wherein they are different, in particular, a `hybrid' configuration, where one
of the two coupled oscillators interacts with a nonMarkovian bath and the other
with a Markovian bath. We ask two groups of questions: Q1) Which time regime
does the bath's nonMarkovianity benefit the system's entanglement most? The
answers we get from detailed numerical studies suggest that A1) For an
initially entangled pair of oscillators, we see that in the intermediate time
range, the duration of entanglement is proportional to the memory time, and it
lasts a fraction of the relaxation time, but at late times when the dynamics
reaches a steady state, the value of the symplectic eigenvalue of the partially
transposed covariance matrix barely benefit from the bath nonMarkovianity. For
the second group of questions: Q2)Can the memory of one nonMarkovian bath be
passed on to another Markovian bath? And if so, does this memory transfer help
to sustain the system's entanglement dynamics? Our results from numerical
studies of the asymmetric hybrid configuration indicate that A2) A system with

  Applications on Edge","Accepted in Utility Cloud Computing Conference 2022",,,,"cs.DC cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Smart IoT-based systems often desire continuous execution of multiple
latency-sensitive Deep Learning (DL) applications. The edge servers serve as
the cornerstone of such IoT-based systems, however, their resource limitations
hamper the continuous execution of multiple (multi-tenant) DL applications. The
challenge is that, DL applications function based on bulky ""neural network (NN)
models"" that cannot be simultaneously maintained in the limited memory space of
the edge. Accordingly, the main contribution of this research is to overcome
the memory contention challenge, thereby, meeting the latency constraints of
the DL applications without compromising their inference accuracy. We propose
an efficient NN model management framework, called Edge-MultiAI, that ushers
the NN models of the DL applications into the edge memory such that the degree
of multi-tenancy and the number of warm-starts are maximized. Edge-MultiAI
leverages NN model compression techniques, such as model quantization, and
dynamically loads NN models for DL applications to stimulate multi-tenancy on
the edge server. We also devise a model management heuristic for Edge-MultiAI,
called iWS-BFE, that functions based on the Bayesian theory to predict the
inference requests for multi-tenant applications, and uses it to choose the
appropriate NN models for loading, hence, increasing the number of warm-start
inferences. We evaluate the efficacy and robustness of Edge-MultiAI under
various configurations. The results reveal that Edge-MultiAI can stimulate the
degree of multi-tenancy on the edge by at least 2X and increase the number of
warm-starts by around 60% without any major loss on the inference accuracy of
the applications.

deceptive both because characterising fragmentation solely in terms of reduced

the effective normal contact force, which is directly proportional to the bulk

result, the jamming volume fraction increases with the shear stress, resulting
in a shear thinning in the suspension viscosity. Moreover, we extend the model

single stable solution to the dynamics, i.e., only freezing (v = 0)
noncanonical domain walls can enter the phantom zone without having to
experience ghost field instability. This means that the solution has an
equation of state (EoS) w_dw < -1 without having to possess negative kinetic
energy. These domain walls give rise to a late-time cosmic acceleration
starting from z = 0.8, resulting in w_dw = -1.5 and w_eff = -1.03 today. We
learn that the EoS of the noncanonical domain walls is independent of the
potential form. We also investigate the perturbation dynamics following the
model. Our simulations show that compared to LCDM, the amplitude of the dark
matter power spectrum in the noncanonical domain wall model is lower, while the
CMB power spectrum is shifted slighly to lower l multipoles. The proposed model

architecture, called joint data deepening and prefetching (JD2P), which is
feature-by-feature offloading comprising two key techniques. The first one is
data deepening, where each data sample's features are sequentially offloaded in
the order of importance determined by the data embedding technique such as
principle component analysis (PCA). No more features are offloaded when the
features offloaded so far are enough to classify the data, resulting in
reducing the amount of offloaded data. The second one is data prefetching,

advance, thus achieving high efficiency via precise prediction and parameter
optimization. To verify the effectiveness of JD2P, we conduct experiments using

a few unseen-domain samples, meta-learning is commonly adopted to address this
issue via test-time training, which is hyperparameter-sensitive and
time-consuming. In contrast, we present a domain generalization framework based
on meta-learning to dig out representative and discriminative internal
properties of real hazy domains without test-time training. To obtain
representative domain-specific information, we attach two entities termed
adaptation network and distance-aware aggregator to our dehazing network. The
adaptation network assists in distilling domain-relevant information from a few
hazy samples and caching it into a collection of features. The distance-aware
aggregator strives to summarize the generated features and filter out
misleading information for more representative internal properties. To enhance
the discrimination of distilled internal information, we present a novel loss
function called domain-relevant contrastive regularization, which encourages
the internal features generated from the same domain more similar and that from
diverse domains more distinct. The generated representative and discriminative
features are regarded as some external variables of our dehazing network to
regress a particular and powerful function for a given domain. The extensive
experiments on real hazy datasets, such as RTTS and URHI, validate that our
proposed method has superior generalization ability than the state-of-the-art
competitors.

  Elliptical-cylinder Magnetic Tunnel Junction",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voltage-induced dynamic switching in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is a
writing technique for voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory
(VCMRAM), which is expected to be an ultimate non-volatile memory with
ultra-low power consumption. In conventional dynamic switching, the width of
sub-nanosecond write voltage pulses must be precisely controlled to achieve a
sufficiently low write-error rate (WER). This very narrow tolerance of pulse
width is the biggest technical difficulty in developing VCMRAM. Heavily damped
precessional switching is a writing scheme for VCMRAM with a substantially high
tolerance of pulse width although the minimum WER has been much higher than
that of conventional dynamic switching with an optimum pulse width. In this
study, we theoretically investigate the effect of MTJ shape and the direction
of the applied magnetic field on the WER of heavily damped precessional
switching. The results show that the WER in elliptical-cylinder MTJ can be
several orders of magnitude smaller than that in usual circular-cylinder MTJ
when the external magnetic field is applied parallel to the minor axis of the
ellipse. The reduction in WER is due to the fact that the demagnetization field
narrows the component of the magnetization distribution perpendicular to the
plane direction immediately before the voltage is applied.

Specifically, we propose a new convolutional neural network, ParCNetV2, that
extends position-aware circular convolution (ParCNet) with oversized
convolutions and bifurcate gate units to enhance attention. The oversized
convolution employs a kernel with twice the input size to model long-range
dependencies through a global receptive field. Simultaneously, it achieves
implicit positional encoding by removing the shift-invariant property from
convolution kernels, i.e., the effective kernels at different spatial locations
are different when the kernel size is twice as large as the input size. The
bifurcate gate unit implements an attention mechanism similar to self-attention
in transformers. It is applied through element-wise multiplication of the two
branches, one serves as feature transformation while the other serves as
attention weights. Additionally, we introduce a uniform local-global
convolution block to unify the design of the early and late stage convolution
blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other convolutional neural networks and hybrid models that combine CNNs and

setups. Irrespective of the initial and symmetry conditions, we find
qualitatively universal evolution processes: The dynamical mass ejection takes
place together with a massive accretion disk formation after the neutron star
is tidally disrupted; Subsequently, the magnetic field in the accretion disk is
amplified by the magnetic winding, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and
magnetorotational instability, which establish a turbulent state inducing the
dynamo and angular momentum transport; The post-merger mass ejection by the
effective viscous processes stemming from the magnetohydrodynamics turbulence
sets in at $\sim300$-$500$ ms after the merger and continues for several
hundred ms; A magnetosphere near the black-hole spin axis is developed and the
collimated strong Poynting flux is generated with its lifetime of $\sim0.5$-$2$
s. We have newly found that the model of no equatorial-plane symmetry shows the
reverse of the magnetic-field polarity in the magnetosphere, which is caused by
the dynamo associated with the magnetorotational instability in the accretion
disk. The model with initially toroidal fields shows the tilt of the disk and
magnetosphere in the late post-merger stage because of the anisotropic
post-merger mass ejection. These effects could terminate the strong
Poynting-luminosity stage within the timescale of $\sim0.5$-$2$ s.

fused with quantized Binomial mechanism-based updates contributed by multiple
users. However, optimizing quantization parameters, communication resources
(e.g., transmit power, bandwidth, and quantization bits), and the added noise
to guarantee the DP requirement and performance of the learned FL model remains
an open and challenging problem. This article aims to jointly optimize the
quantization and Binomial mechanism parameters and communication resources to
maximize the convergence rate under the constraints of the wireless network and
DP requirement. To that end, we first derive a novel DP budget estimation of
the FL with quantization/noise that is tighter than the state-of-the-art bound.
We then provide a theoretical bound on the convergence rate. This theoretical
bound is decomposed into two components, including the variance of the global
gradient and the quadratic bias that can be minimized by optimizing the
communication resources, and quantization/noise parameters. The resulting
optimization turns out to be a Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP)
problem. To tackle it, we first transform this MINLP problem into a new problem
whose solutions are proved to be the optimal solutions of the original one. We
then propose an approximate algorithm to solve the transformed problem with an
arbitrary relative error guarantee. Extensive simulations show that under the
same wireless resource constraints and DP protection requirements, the proposed
approximate algorithm achieves an accuracy close to the accuracy of the
conventional FL without quantization/noise. The results can achieve a higher
convergence rate while preserving users' privacy.

give rise to interesting quantum many-body phenomena. However, its realization
usually demands unconventional techniques, for example the artificial gauge
fields or higher-orbit Feshbach resonances, and is not highly controllable.
Here, we propose a valid and feasible scheme for realizing a tunable
finite-range interaction for spinless fermions immersed into the bath of
bosons. The strength of the effective interaction for the fermionic subsystem
is artificially tunable by manipulating bosons, ranging from the repulsive to
attractive regime. And the interaction distance is locked to the hopping of
bosons, making the finite-range interaction perfectly clean for the fermionic
subsystem. Specifically we find that, by introducing an additional staggered
hopping of bosons, the proposal is readily applied to search the Majorana
corner modes in such a spinless system, without implementation of complex
artificial gauge fields, which is totally distinct from existing results
reported in spinful systems. Therefore this scheme provides a potential
platform for exploring the unconventional topological superfluids and other
nontrivial phases induced by long-range interactions in ultracold atoms.

One example is assembling an electronic device in series with an on-chip
resistor. The quantum laws of electricity of the device is modified at low
energies and temperatures by dissipative interactions from the resistor, a
phenomenon known as dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB). The DCB strength is
usually non-adjustable in a fixed environment defined by the resistor. Here, we
design an on-chip circuit for InAs-Al hybrid nanowires where the DCB strength
can be gate-tuned in situ. InAs-Al nanowires could host Andreev or Majorana
zero-energy states. This technique enables tracking the evolution of the same
state while tuning the DCB strength from weak to strong. We observe the
transition from a zero-bias conductance peak to split peaks for Andreev
zero-energy states. Our technique opens the door to in situ tuning interaction
strength on zero-energy states.

number skin-friction drag reduction strategy reported by Marusic et al. (Nat.
Commun., vol. 12, 2021). The strategy involves imposing relatively
low-frequency streamwise travelling waves of spanwise velocity at the wall to
actuate the drag generating outer-scales. This approach has proven to be more
energy-efficient than the conventional method of directly targeting the drag
producing inner-scales, which typically requires actuation at higher
frequencies. Notably, it is observed that actuating the outer-scales at low
frequencies leads to a substantial attenuation of the major drag producing
inner-scales. In the present study, we find that increased drag reduction, on
imposition of spanwise wall oscillations, is always associated with an
increased coupling between the inner and outer scales. This enhanced coupling
emerges through manipulation of the phase relationships between these
triadically linked scales, with the actuation forcing the entire range of
energy-containing scales, from the inner (viscous) to the outer (inertial)
scales, to be more in-phase. The energy-efficient drag reduction strategy is
expected to further improve at very high Reynolds numbers, where the energised
outer-scales are known to more strongly superimpose and modulate the
inner-scales. This Reynolds number dependence of the non-linear coupling is
also shown to be a consequence of the manipulated inter-scale phase
relationships, by analyzing canonical boundary layer data across a large
Reynolds number range. Leveraging inter-scale interactions, therefore, offers a
plausible mechanism for achieving energy-efficient drag reduction at high
Reynolds numbers.

find that a large areal relaxation time results in flows towards the equator of

correctness, GateKeeper takes a novel approach to develop a comprehensive model
of a service without requiring formal methods expertise. We harness available
testing suites routinely used in service development to tighten the model to
known correct service implementation. GateKeeper uses the resulting model to
automatically generate (1) a correct-by-construction runtime service validator
in C that is linked with a trusted application and guards each service
invocation to conform to the model; and (2) a targeted model-driven
vulnerability checker for analyzing black-box applications.
  We evaluate GateKeeper on Intel SGX enclaves. We develop comprehensive models
of a POSIX file system and OS synchronization primitives while using thousands
of existing test suites to tighten their models to the actual Linux

exciting prospects as one of the promising technologies capable of meeting the
requirements of the sixth generation networks such as low-latency, reliability,
and dense connectivity. However, validation of test cases and real-world
experiments of RISs are imperative to their practical viability. To this end,
this paper presents a physical demonstration of an RIS-assisted communication
system in an indoor environment in order to enhance the coverage by increasing
the received signal power. We first analyze the performance of the RIS-assisted
system for a set of different locations of the receiver and observe around 10
dB improvement in the received signal power by careful RIS phase adjustments.
Then, we employ an efficient codebook design for RIS configurations to adjust
the RIS states on the move without feedback channels. We also investigate the
impact of an efficient grouping of RIS elements, whose objective is to reduce
the training time needed to find the optimal RIS configuration. In our
extensive experimental measurements, we demonstrate that with the proposed
grouping scheme, training time is reduced from one-half to one-eighth by
sacrificing only a few dBs in received signal power.

for various cell functions including the propagation of the nervous impulse. In

for such transitions on the single cell level, however, has so far not been
provided leaving the field unattended by the biological community. Here we
demonstrate that single cells of a human neuronal cell line, display all
optical features of a sharp, highly nonlinear phase transition within their

denaturation. Triggered by temperature and modified by pH here, a thermodynamic
approach, strongly suggests, that similar nonlinear state changes can be
induced by other variables such as calcium or mechanical stress. At least in
lipid membranes such state changes are accompanied by significant changes in

metal artifact domains. Specifically, to explore the non-local repetitive
streaking patterns of metal artifacts, we encode them as an explicit tight
frame sparse representation model with adaptive thresholds. Furthermore, we
design a contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to
exploit clean CT images and metal-affected images as positive and negative

conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[Y_t|\mathcal{G}_{t}]$ on a general

conditionally reflected BSDE (for short, conditional RBSDE). Conditional RBSDE
subsumes classical RBSDE with a pointwise reflection barrier, and the recent
developed BSDE with a mean reflection constraint, as its two special and
extreme cases: they exactly correspond to $\{\mathcal{G}_{t}\}$ being the full
filtration to represent complete information, and the degenerated filtration to

existence and uniqueness under mild conditions by combining the Snell envelope
method with Skorokhod lemma. We also discuss its connection, in the case of
linear driver, to a class of optimal stopping problems in presence of partial

With the help of this connection, we study weak formulations of a class of
optimal control problems with reflected recursive functionals by characterizing
the related optimal solution and value. Moreover, in the special case of
recursive functionals being RBSDE with pointwise reflections, we study the
strong formulations of related stochastic backward recursive control and
zero-sum games, both in non-Markovian framework, that are of their own

be accompanied by a propagating cell-surface deformation with a nano-scale
amplitude. Typically, this cell surface is covered by external layers of
polymer material (extracellular matrix, cell wall material etc.). It was
recently demonstrated in excitable plant cells (Chara Braunii) that the rigid
external layer (cell wall) hinders the underlying deformation. When the cell
membrane was separated from the cell wall by osmosis, a mechanical deformation,
in the micrometer range, was observed upon excitation of the cell. The
underlying mechanism of this mechanical pulse has up to date remained elusive.
Herein we report that Chara cells can undergo a pearling instability, and when
the pearled fragments were excited even larger and more regular cell shape
changes were observed (about 10 to 100 um in amplitude). These transient
cellular deformations were captured by a curvature model that is based on three
parameters: surface tension, bending rigidity and pressure difference across
the surface. In this paper these parameters are extracted by curve-fitting to
the experimental cellular shapes at rest and during excitation. This is a
necessary step to identify the mechanical parameters that change during an
action potential.

transformer is reducing the computational cost of self attention modules by
adopting sparse attention or using local attention windows. In contrast, we
propose a different approach that aims to improve the performance of
transformer-based architectures by densifying the attention pattern.
Specifically, we proposed forward cross attention for hybrid vision transformer
(FcaFormer), where tokens from previous blocks in the same stage are secondary
used. To achieve this, the FcaFormer leverages two innovative components:
learnable scale factors (LSFs) and a token merge and enhancement module (TME).
The LSFs enable efficient processing of cross tokens, while the TME generates
representative cross tokens. By integrating these components, the proposed
FcaFormer enhances the interactions of tokens across blocks with potentially
different semantics, and encourages more information flows to the lower levels.
Based on the forward cross attention (Fca), we have designed a series of
FcaFormer models that achieve the best trade-off between model size,
computational cost, memory cost, and accuracy. For example, without the need
for knowledge distillation to strengthen training, our FcaFormer achieves 83.1%
top-1 accuracy on Imagenet with only 16.3 million parameters and about 3.6
billion MACs. This saves almost half of the parameters and a few computational
costs while achieving 0.7% higher accuracy compared to distilled
EfficientFormer.

Herein, we used the dye di 4- -ANEPPDHQ, which is known to be sensitive to the
physical state and transmembrane potential of membranes, in order to gain
insight into compression waves in lipid-based membrane interfaces. The dye was
incorporated into lipid monolayers made of phosphatidylserine or
phosphatidylcholine at the air-water-interface. A significant blue shift of the
emission spectrum was detected when the state of the monolayer was changed from
the liquid expanded (LE) to the liquid condensed (LC) phase. This
transition-sensitivity of di-4-ANEPPDHQ was generalized in experiments with the
bulk solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Upon crystallization of solvent, the
emission spectrum also underwent a blue shift. During compression pulses in
lipid monolayers, a significant fluorescence response was only observed when in
the main transition regime. The optical signature of these waves, in terms of
sign and magnitude, was identical to the response of di-4-ANEPPDHQ during
action potentials in neurons and excitable plant cells. These findings
corroborated the suggestion that action potentials are nonlinear state changes
that propagate in the cell membrane.

derived and shown to hold irrespective of other properties of the codes. In
particular, we consider the problems of lossless and lossy source coding,
Slepian--Wolf coding, Wyner--Ziv coding, Berger--Tung coding, multiple
description coding, asymmetric channel coding, Gelfand--Pinsker coding, coding
for multiple access channels, Marton coding for broadcast channels, and coding
for cloud radio access networks (C-RAN's). We show that the coding schemes can
achieve the best known inner bounds for most of these problems, provided that
the constituent point-to-point channel codes are rate-optimal. This would allow
one to leverage commercial off-the-shelf codes for point-to-point symmetric
channels in the practical implementation of codes over networks. Simulation
results demonstrate the gain of the proposed coding schemes compared to
existing practical solutions to these problems.

challenge for numerous application domains, such as geoscience and space-based
earth observation, when the available sensors or the data collection processes
lead to irregularly-sampled and noisy observations. Optimal interpolation (OI),
also referred to as kriging, provides a theoretical framework to solve
interpolation problems for Gaussian processes (GP). The associated
computational complexity being rapidly intractable for n-dimensional tensors
and increasing numbers of observations, a rich literature has emerged to
address this issue using ensemble methods, sparse schemes or iterative
approaches. Here, we introduce a neural OI scheme. It exploits a variational
formulation with convolutional auto-encoders and a trainable iterative
gradient-based solver. Theoretically equivalent to the OI formulation, the
trainable solver asymptotically converges to the OI solution when dealing with
both stationary and non-stationary linear spatio-temporal GPs. Through a
bi-level optimization formulation, we relate the learning step and the
selection of the training loss to the theoretical properties of the OI, which
is an unbiased estimator with minimal error variance. Numerical experiments for
2D+t synthetic GP datasets demonstrate the relevance of the proposed scheme to
learn computationally-efficient and scalable OI models and solvers from data.
As illustrated for a real-world interpolation problems for satellite-derived
geophysical dynamics, the proposed framework also extends to non-linear and
multimodal interpolation problems and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art interpolation methods, when dealing with very high missing
data rates.

labor intensive and impractical. Previous researches on pre-trained language

the video encoder from the pre-trained video-language model on the generative

the integration of different components, via inter/intra modality relation.

jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of
its subspace (or receive statistics) acquired through a dedicated training
phase. This strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication
rate since no data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can
be evaded by smart or multi-antenna jammers that are quiet during the training
phase or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying
beamforming. To address these drawbacks, we propose joint jammer mitigation and
data detection (JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core
idea is to estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with
detecting the transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need
for a dedicated rate-reducing training period while enabling the mitigation of
smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We instantiate our paradigm with
SANDMAN, a simple and practical algorithm for multi-user MIMO uplink JMD.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD, and of SANDMAN in
particular, for jammer mitigation.

our proposed CoAlign is more practical since it doesn't require any

finding median slopes $\alpha^{\rm VES}$=0.98 and $\alpha^{\rm VKS}$=1.42, with
a galaxy-to-galaxy rms fluctuation that is substantially smaller for the
volumetric ES law (0.18 vs 0.41). By combining all regions in spirals with
those in additional 13 dwarfs and one UDG into one single dataset, it is found
that the rms scatter of the volumetric ES law at given x-axis is 0.25 dex, also
smaller than that of the volumetric KS law (0.34 dex). At the extremely low gas
density regime as offered by the UDG, the volumetric KS law breaks down but the
volumetric ES law still holds. On the other hand, as compared to the surface
density ES law, the volumetric ES law instead has a slightly larger rms
scatter, consistent with the scenario that the ES law has an intrinsic slope of
$\alpha^{\rm VES} \equiv$1 but the additional observational error of the scale
height increases the uncertainty of the volume density. The unity slope of the

adversaries with access to machine learning models from extracting information
about individual training points. Differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DPSGD) is the most popular training method with differential privacy
in image recognition. However, existing DPSGD schemes lead to significant
performance degradation, which prevents the application of differential
privacy. In this paper, we propose a simulated annealing-based differentially

differentially private gradient descent proceed in the right direction in each

the noise properties. Building on the work of Lindsey et al., we define the
forward- and backward-propagated wave fields (ingression and egression) in
terms of a Green's function. This Green's function is computed using an
accurate forward solver in the frequency domain. We analyse overlapping
segments of 31 hr of SDO/HMI dopplergrams, with a cadence of 24 hr. Phase
shifts between the ingression and the egression are measured and averaged to
detect active regions on the far side. The phase maps are compared with direct
EUV intensity maps from STEREO/EUVI. We confirm that medium-size active regions
can be detected on the far side with high confidence. Their evolution (and
possible emergence) can be monitored on a daily time scale. Seismic maps
averaged over 3 days provide an active region detection rate as high as 75% and
a false discovery rate only as low as 7%, for active regions with areas above
one thousandth of an hemisphere. For a large part, these improvements can be
attributed to the use of a complete Green's function (all skips) and to the use
of all observations on the front side (full pupil). Improved helioseismic

is useful in a situation where collaborative training of machine learning

at investigating the implementation of lightweight federated learning to be
deployed on a diverse range of distributed resources, including
resource-constrained edge devices and resourceful cloud servers. As a resource
management framework, the FogBus2 framework, which is a containerized
distributed resource management framework, is selected as the base framework
for the implementation. This research provides an architecture and lightweight
implementation of federated learning in the FogBus2. Moreover, a worker
selection technique is proposed and implemented. The worker selection algorithm
selects an appropriate set of workers to participate in the training to achieve
higher training time efficiency. Besides, this research integrates synchronous

worker selection algorithm. It is proven that asynchronous federated learning
is more time efficient compared to synchronous federated learning or sequential
machine learning training. The performance evaluation shows the efficiency of
the federated learning mechanism implemented and integrated with the FogBus2

Parts of the Berry curvature can be understood as the external magnetic field

effective charges can provide insight into the electronic structure of a given
molecule or, in other words, whether we can perform a population analysis based
on the Berry curvature. To develop our approach, we first rewrite the Berry
curvature in terms of charges that partially capture the effective charges and
their dependence on the nuclear velocities. With these Berry charges and charge
fluctuations, we then construct our population analysis yielding atomic charges
and overlap populations. Calculations at the Hartree$-$Fock level reveal that
the atomic charges are similar to those obtained from atomic polar tensors.
However, since we additionally obtain an estimate for the fluctuations of the
charges and a partitioning of the atomic charges into contributions from all
atoms, we conclude that the Berry population analysis is a useful alternative
tool to analyze the electronic structure of molecules.

machine learning algorithms. In FL, a global model iteratively collects the
parameters of local models without accessing their local data. However, a
significant challenge in FL is handling the heterogeneity of local data
distribution, which often results in a drifted global model that is difficult
to converge. To address this issue, current methods employ different strategies
such as knowledge distillation, weighted model aggregation, and multi-task
learning. These approaches are referred to as asynchronous FL, as they align
user models either locally or post-hoc, where model drift has already occurred
or has been underestimated. In this paper, we propose an active and synchronous
correlation approach to address the challenge of user heterogeneity in FL.
Specifically, our approach aims to approximate FL as standard deep learning by
actively and synchronously scheduling user learning pace in each round with a
dynamic multi-phase curriculum. A global curriculum is formed by an
auto-regressive auto-encoder that integrates all user curricula on the server.
This global curriculum is then divided into multiple phases and broadcast to
users to measure and align the domain-agnostic learning pace. Empirical studies
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing asynchronous approaches in

difference and Haar wavelets to solve nonlocal hyperbolic partial differential
equations. Developing an efficient and accurate numerical method to solve such
problem is a difficult task due to the presence of nonlocal boundary condition.
The speciality of the proposed method is to handle integral boundary condition
efficiently using the given data. Due to various attractive properties of Haar
wavelets such as closed form expression, compact support and orthonormality,
Haar wavelets are efficiently used for spatial discretization and second order
finite difference is used for temporal discretization. Stability and error
estimates have been investigated in order to ensure the convergence of the
method. Finally, numerical results are compared with few existing results and
it is shown that numerical results obtained by the proposed method is better
than few existing results.

  Contexts","Published in ISMIR",,,,"cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As music has become more available especially on music streaming platforms,
people have started to have distinct preferences to fit to their varying
listening situations, also known as context. Hence, there has been a growing
interest in considering the user's situation when recommending music to users.
Previous works have proposed user-aware autotaggers to infer situation-related
tags from music content and user's global listening preferences. However, in a
practical music retrieval system, the autotagger could be only used by assuming
that the context class is explicitly provided by the user. In this work, for
designing a fully automatised music retrieval system, we propose to
disambiguate the user's listening information from their stream data. Namely,
we propose a system which can generate a situational playlist for a user at a
certain time 1) by leveraging user-aware music autotaggers, and 2) by
automatically inferring the user's situation from stream data (e.g. device,
network) and user's general profile information (e.g. age). Experiments show
that such a context-aware personalized music retrieval system is feasible, but
the performance decreases in the case of new users, new tracks or when the
number of context classes increases.

plausibility of key assumption of transitivity. This assumption implies that
the effect modifiers' distribution is similar across treatment comparisons.
Transitivity is statistically manifested through the consistency assumption
which suggests that direct and indirect evidence are in agreement. Several
methods have been suggested to evaluate consistency. A popular approach
suggests adding inconsistency factors to the NMA model. We follow a different
direction by describing each inconsistency factor with a candidate covariate
whose choice relies on variable selection techniques. Our proposed method,
Stochastic Search Inconsistency Factor Selection (SSIFS), evaluates the
consistency assumption both locally and globally, by applying the stochastic
search variable selection method to determine whether the inconsistency factors
should be included in the model. The posterior inclusion probability of each
inconsistency factor quantifies how likely is a specific comparison to be
inconsistent. We use posterior model odds or the median probability model to
decide on the importance of inconsistency factors. Differences between direct
and indirect evidence can be incorporated into the inconsistency detection
process. A key point of our proposed approach is the construction of a
reasonable ""informative"" prior concerning network consistency. The prior is
based on the elicitation of information derived historical data from 201
published network meta-analyses. The performance of our proposed method is
evaluated in two published network meta-analyses. The proposed methodology is
publicly available in an R package called ssifs, developed and maintained by

expressed in terms of wet surface ratio, in addition to the in-situ water level
data. The objective is to improve the representation of the flood plain
dynamics with a TELEMAC-2D model and an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The EnKF
control vector is composed of friction coefficients and corrective parameters
to the input forcing. It is augmented with the water level state averaged over
selected subdomains of the floodplain. This work focuses on the 2019 flood
event that occurred over the Garonne Marmandaise catchment. The merits of
assimilating SAR-derived flood plain data complementary to in-situ water level
observations are shown in the control parameter and observation spaces with 1D
and 2D assessment metrics. It was also shown that the assimilation of Wet
surface Ratio in the flood plain complementary to in-situ data in the river bed
brings significative improvement when a corrective term on flood plain
hydraulic state is included in the control vector. Yet, it has barely no impact
in the river bed that is sufficiently well described by in-situ data. We
highlighted that the correction of the hydraulic state in the flood plain
significantly improved the flood dynamics, especially during the recession.
This proof-of-concept study paves the way towards near-real-time flood
forecast, making the most of remote sensing-derived flood observations.

entropy model, which estimates the distribution of the latent representation,
plays a crucial role in boosting rate-distortion performance. However, most

correlations. To tackle this issue, we propose the Multi-Reference Entropy
Model (MEM) and the advanced version, MEM$^+$. These models capture the
different types of correlations present in latent representation. Specifically,
We first divide the latent representation into slices. When decoding the
current slice, we use previously decoded slices as context and employ the
attention map of the previously decoded slice to predict global correlations in
the current slice. To capture local contexts, we introduce two enhanced
checkerboard context capturing techniques that avoids performance degradation.
Based on MEM and MEM$^+$, we propose image compression models MLIC and
MLIC$^+$. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our MLIC and
MLIC+ models achieve state-of-the-art performance, reducing BD-rate by $8.05\%$

role in their functionality, transport and phase behaviour. In this work, we
investigate the two-dimensional diffusion of smoothly curved colloidal rods --
also known as colloidal bananas -- as a function of their opening angle,
{\alpha}. We measure the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of
the particles with opening angles ranging from 0{\deg} (straight rods) to
nearly 360{\deg}(closed rings). In particular, we find that the anisotropic
diffusion of the particles varies non-monotonically with their opening angle

of the particles when {\alpha}>180{\deg}.
  We also find that the rotational diffusion coefficient of nearly closed rings
is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of straight rods of the

Slender Body Theory, indicating that the dynamical behavior of the particles
arises primarily from their local drag anisotropy. These results highlight the
impact of curvature on the Brownian Motion of elongated colloidal particles,

that there is a lack of experimental information on the electromagnetic
response of metals to low-frequency evanescent waves, we propose an experiment
on measuring the magnetic field of an oscillating magnetic dipole spaced in
vacuum above a thick metallic plate. According to our results, the lateral
components of this field are governed by the transverse electric evanescent
waves and may vary by orders of magnitude depending on the model describing the
permittivity of the plates used in calculations and the oscillation frequency
of the magnetic dipole. Measuring the lateral component of the magnetic field
for typical parameters of the magnetic dipole designed in the form of 1-mm

a response function of metal in the range of low-frequency evanescent waves.

theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model are in
contradiction with the high-precision measurements of the Casimir force at

are likely to become bound with high eccentricities, resulting in a burst of
gravitational radiation at their point of closest approach. When such a binary
is perturbed by a third body, the evolution of the orbit is affected, and
gravitational-wave burst times are altered. The bursts times therefore encode
information about the tertiary. In order to extract this information, we
require a prescription for the relationship between the tertiary properties and
the gravitational-wave burst times. In this paper, we demonstrate a toy model
for the burst times of a secular three-body system. We show how Bayesian
inference can be employed to deduce the tertiary properties when the bursts are
detected by next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We study
the bursts from an eccentric binary with a total mass of $60$~M$_\odot$
orbiting an $6 \times 10^{8}$~M$_\odot$ supermassive black hole. When we assume
no knowledge of the eccentric binary, we are unable to tightly constrain the
existence or properties of the tertiary, and we recover biased posterior
probability distributions for the parameters of the eccentric binary. However,
when the properties of the binary are already well-known -- as is likely if the
late inspiral and merger are also detected -- we are able to more accurately
infer the mass of the perturber, $m_3$, and its distance from the binary, $R$.
When we assume measurement precision on the binary parameters consistent with
expectations for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, we can be
greater than $90\%$ confident that the binary is perturbed. [...]

the sampling process. Despite its remarkable simplicity, our method yields
aesthetically pleasing images with few sampling iterations, allows for
intriguing ways for conditioning the model, and imparts advantages absent in
state-of-the-art techniques. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in
achieving outcomes comparable to existing works, we have trained a one-billion
parameter text-conditional model, which we refer to as ""Paella"". In the
interest of fostering future exploration in this field, we have made our source
code and models publicly accessible for the research community.

effective method for solving NP-hard problems because of the vast parallelism
and high-density storage of DNA molecules. Although DNA computing has been
exploited to solve various intractable computational problems, such as the
Hamiltonian path problem, SAT problem, and graph coloring problem, there has
been little discussion of designing universal DNA computing-based models, which
can solve a class of problems. In this paper, by leveraging the dynamic and
enzyme-free properties of DNA strand displacement, we propose a universal model
named DCMSubset for solving subset problems in graph theory. The model aims to
find a minimum (or maximum) set satisfying given constraints. For each element
x involved in a given problem, DCMSubset uses an exclusive single-stranded DNA
molecule to model x as well as a specific DNA complex to model the relationship
between x and other elements. Based on the proposed model, we conducted
simulation and biochemical experiments on three kinds of subset problems, a
minimum dominating set, maximum independent set, and minimum vertex cover. We
observed that DCMSubset can also be used to solve the graph coloring problem.
Moreover, we extended DCMSubset to a model for solving the SAT problem. The
results of experiments showed the feasibility and university of the proposed
method. Our results highlighted the potential for DNA strand displacement to
act as a computation tool to solve NP-hard problems.

optimal input. We retrieve classical Lyapunov stability guarantees by
performing a sufficient number of gradient iterations until fulfilling a
stopping criteria. Such a real-time control approach allows for higher sampling
rates and faster feedback from the system which is advantageous for the class
of highly variable and uncertain drug infusion problems. To demonstrate the
controller's potential, we apply it to hypnosis control in anesthesia of two

mechanism applies to planets within the inner cavities of their companion
protoplanetary disks. A massive disk with an inner truncation may become
eccentric due to non-adiabatic effects associated with gas cooling, and can
retain its eccentricity in long-lived coherently-precessing eccentric modes; as
the disk disperses, the inner planet will encounter a secular resonance with
the eccentric disk when the planet and the disk have the same apsidal
precession rates; the eccentricity of the planet is then excited to a large
value as the system goes through the resonance. In this work, we solve the
eccentric modes of a model disk for a wide range of masses. We then adopt an
approximate secular dynamics model to calculate the long-term evolution of the
""planet + dispersing disk"" system. The planet attains a large eccentricity
(between 0.1 and 0.6) in our calculations, even though the disk eccentricity is
quite small ($\lesssim0.05$). This eccentricity excitation can be understood in
terms of the mode conversion (``avoided crossing'') phenomenon associated with
the evolution of the ""planet + disk"" eccentricity eigenstates.

level. We generate polarized images and spectra for some of these models and
find out that at the radio frequencies, both of the linear and the circular

higher frequencies a substantial positron fraction washes out the circular
polarization. We report strong degeneracies between different emission models

strong evolution in incidence approaching the epoch of hydrogen reionization.
Follow-up surveys examining fields around these metals have resulted in galaxy
detections but the direct physical relationship between the detected galaxies
and absorbers is unclear. Upcoming observations will illuminate this
galaxy-absorber relationship, but the theoretical framework for interpreting
these observations is lacking. To inform future z>5 studies, we define the
expected relationship between metals and galaxies using the Technicolor Dawn
simulation to model metal absorption from z=5-7, encompassing the end of
reionization. We find that metal absorber types and strengths are slightly
better associated with their environment than with the traits of their host
galaxies, as absorption system strengths are more strongly correlated with the
local galaxy overdensity than the stellar mass of their host galaxy. For
redshifts prior to the end of the epoch of reionization, strong high ionization
transitions like C IV are more spatially correlated with brighter galaxies on
scales of a few hundred proper kpc than are low ionization systems, due to the
former's preference for environments with higher UVB amplitudes and those ions'
relative rarity at z>6. Post-reionization, the galaxy counts near these
high-ionization ions are reduced, and increase surrounding certain
low-ionization ions due to a combination of their relative abundances and
preferred denser gas phase. We conclude that galaxy-absorber relationships are
expected to evolve rapidly such that high-ionization absorbers are better
tracers of galaxies pre-reionization while low-ionization absorbers are better
post-reionization.

continuous progress on introducing deep network models, and recently the graph

However, these deep learning frameworks based on point estimation suffer from
low generalization and inability to quantify the classification results
uncertainty. On the other hand, simply applying the Bayesian Neural Network
(BNN) based on distribution estimation to classify the HSI is unable to achieve
high classification accuracy due to the large amount of parameters. In this
paper, we design a Bayesian layer with Bayesian idea as an insertion layer into
point estimation based neural networks, and propose a Bayesian Layer Graph
Convolutional Network (BLGCN) model by combining graph convolution operations,
which can effectively extract graph information and estimate the uncertainty of

built to solve the sample imbalance problem of HSI dataset. Finally, we design
a dynamic control training strategy based on the confidence interval of the
classification results, which will terminate the training early when the
confidence interval reaches the preseted threshold. The experimental results
show that our model achieves a balance between high classification accuracy and
strong generalization. In addition, it can quantifies the uncertainty of the

time and the sensor gain usually require to be carefully chosen to obtain
images with satisfying visual quality. For example, the images with high ISO
usually have inescapable noise, while the long-exposure ones may be blurry due
to camera shake or object motion. Existing solutions generally suggest to seek
a balance between noise and blur, and learn denoising or deblurring models
under either full- or self-supervision. However, the real-world training pairs
are difficult to collect, and the self-supervised methods merely rely on blurry
or noisy images are limited in performance. In this work, we tackle this
problem by jointly leveraging the short-exposure noisy image and the
long-exposure blurry image for better image restoration. Such setting is
practically feasible due to that short-exposure and long-exposure images can be
either acquired by two individual cameras or synthesized by a long burst of
images. Moreover, the short-exposure images are hardly blurry, and the
long-exposure ones have negligible noise. Their complementarity makes it
feasible to learn restoration model in a self-supervised manner. Specifically,
the noisy images can be used as the supervision information for deblurring,
while the sharp areas in the blurry images can be utilized as the auxiliary
supervision information for self-supervised denoising. By learning in a
collaborative manner, the deblurring and denoising tasks in our method can
benefit each other. Experiments on synthetic and real-world images show the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method. Codes are available at

Although conical intersections have been observed experimentally, the geometric

internal state of a trapped atomic ion serves as the electronic state and the
motion of the atomic nuclei are encoded into the normal modes of motion of the

state-dependent forces to the ion with a near-resonant laser. We experimentally

geometric phase, which affects the outcome of the reaction through
quantum-mechanical interference. Past experiments have measured indirect

two-dimensional wavepacket densities of a trapped ion. Experiments agree with

based on VST ATLAS$+$NEOWISE imaging surveys and aims to reach a QSO sky
density of $130$ deg$^{-2}$ for $z<2.2$ and $\sim30$ deg$^{-2}$ for $z>2.2$.
One of the aims of this catalogue is to select QSO targets for the 4MOST
Cosmology Redshift Survey. To guide our selection, we use X-ray/UV/optical/MIR
data in the extended William Herschel Deep Field (WHDF) where we find a
$g<22.5$ broad-line QSO density of $269\pm67$ deg$^{-2}$, roughly consistent
with the expected $\sim196$ deg$^{-2}$. We also find that $\sim25$% of our QSOs
are morphologically classed as optically extended. Overall, we find that in
these deep data, MIR, UV and X-ray selections are all $\sim70-90$% complete
while X-ray suffers less contamination than MIR and UV. MIR is however more
sensitive than X-ray or UV to $z>2.2$ QSOs at $g<22.5$ and the eROSITA limit.
We then adjust the selection criteria from our previous 2QDES pilot survey and
prioritise VST ATLAS candidates that show both UV and MIR excess, while also
selecting candidates initially classified as extended. We test our selections
using data from DESI (which will be released in DR1) and 2dF to estimate the
efficiency and completeness of our selections, and finally we use ANNz2 to
determine photometric redshifts for the QSO candidate catalogue. Applying over
the $\sim4700$ deg$^2$ ATLAS area gives us $\sim917,000$ $z<2.2$ QSO candidates
of which 472,000 are likely to be $z<2.2$ QSOs, implying a sky density of
$\sim$100 deg$^{-2}$, which our WHDF analysis suggests will rise to at least
130 deg$^{-2}$ when eROSITA X-ray candidates are included. At $z>2.2$, we find
$\sim310,000$ candidates, of which 169,000 are likely to be QSOs for a sky
density of $\sim36$ deg$^{-2}$.

This lower bound holds even restricted to graphs of arbitrary density and for

sum-of-squares algorithm for an estimation problem with Gaussian noise in order
to get the algorithm that works with the symmetric noise model. Our framework
extends far beyond previous results on symmetric noise models and is even
robust to adversarial perturbations.
  As concrete examples, we investigate two problems for which no efficient
algorithms were known to work for heavy-tailed noise: tensor PCA and sparse
PCA. For the former, our algorithm recovers the principal component in
polynomial time when the signal-to-noise ratio is at least
$\tilde{O}(n^{p/4}/\alpha)$, that matches (up to logarithmic factors) current
best known algorithmic guarantees for Gaussian noise. For the latter, our
algorithm runs in quasipolynomial time and matches the state-of-the-art
guarantees for quasipolynomial time algorithms in the case of Gaussian noise.
Using a reduction from the planted clique problem, we provide evidence that the
quasipolynomial time is likely to be necessary for sparse PCA with symmetric
noise.
  In our proofs we use bounds on the covering numbers of sets of
pseudo-expectations, which we obtain by certifying in sum-of-squares upper
bounds on the Gaussian complexities of sets of solutions. This approach for
bounding the covering numbers of sets of pseudo-expectations may be interesting

publicly release flat-disk tilted-ring kinematic models for 109/592 unique HI
detections in these fields. The modelling method adopted here - which we call
the WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto-Pipeline (WKAPP) and for which the
corresponding scripts are also publicly available - consists of combining
results from the homogeneous application of the FAT and 3DBAROLO algorithms to
the subset of 209 detections with sufficient resolution and S/N in order to
generate optimized model parameters and uncertainties. The 109 models presented
here tend to be gas rich detections resolved by at least 3-4 synthesized beams
across their major axes, but there is no obvious environmental bias in the
modelling. The data release described here is the first step towards the
derivation of similar products for thousands of spatially-resolved WALLABY
detections via a dedicated kinematic pipeline. Such a large publicly available
and homogeneously analyzed dataset will be a powerful legacy product that that
will enable a wide range of scientific studies.

using the most recent atomic mass evaluations. The magnetic field significantly
affects the equation of state (EoS) and the properties of the outer crust, such
as neutron drip density, pressure, and melting temperature. For the inner

the crustal properties in a magnetic environment. The inner crust properties,
such as mass and charge number distribution, isospin asymmetry, cluster

sensitive to the magnetic field's strength. The density-dependent symmetry
energy influences the magnetic inner crust like the field-free case. We study
the probable modifications in the pasta structures and it is observed that
their mass and thickness changes by $\sim 10-15 \%$ depending upon the magnetic

investigated for the magnetized crust in the context of quasiperiodic

Different types of event relations naturally interact with each other, but
existing datasets only cover limited relation types at once, which prevents

particular by their combined capabilities for geometric design and solution of
parameterized geometries. In most IGA applications, the geometry is modelled by
multiple patches with different physical or geometrical parameters. In
particular, we are interested in nonaffine problems characterized by a
high-dimensional parameter space. We consider the Empirical Interpolation

decomposition to reduce the dimensionality. We couple spline patches in a
parameterized setting, where multiple evaluations are performed for a given set

static condensation procedure is employed, whereas in the interior a reduced
basis approximation enables an efficient offline/online decomposition. The full

needed to compare theory predictions to measurable quantities. Many and large
MC samples are needed to be generated to take into account all the systematics.
Therefore, the MC statistics (and hence the MC modeling uncertainties) become a
limiting factor for most measurements. Moreover, the significant computational
cost of these programs becomes a bottleneck in most physics analyses.
Therefore, it is extremely important to find a way to reduce the MC samples
generated to decrease the MC statistical uncertainties and lower the
computational cost. In these proceedings, we evaluate an approach called Deep
neural network using Classification for Tuning and Reweighting (DCTR). DCTR is
a method based on a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to reweight simulations to
different models or model parameters and fit simulations, using the full
kinematic information in the event. This reweighting methodology avoids the
need for simulating the detector response multiple times by incorporating the
relevant variations in a single sample. In this way, the MC statistical
uncertainties and the computational cost are both reduced. Moreover, unlike the
standard reweighting, in which the ratio in bins of two histograms at truth
level is performed, multidimensional and unbinned information can be used as
inputs to the DNN. In addition, DCTR can perform tasks that are not possible
with other current existing methods, such as continuous reweighting as a
function of any MC parameter, simultaneous reweighting of more MC parameters
and tuning MC simulations to the data. We test the method on MC simulations of
top quark pair production, which we reweight to different SM parameter values

normal) viscous fluids are well established. This is also the case for the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, governing quantum inviscid flows (or superfluids) in
the zero temperature limit. In quantum flows, like liquid helium II at
intermediate temperatures between zero and 2.17 K, a normal fluid and a
superfluid coexist with independent velocity fields. The most advanced existing
models for such systems use the Navier-Stokes equations for the normal fluid
and a simplified description of the superfluid, based on the dynamics of
quantized vortex filaments, with ad hoc reconnection rules. There was a single
attempt (C. Coste, The European Physical Journal B - Condensed Matter and
Complex Systems, 1998) to couple Navier-Stokes and Gross-Pitaevskii equations
in a global model intended to describe the compressible two-fluid liquid helium
II. We present in this contribution a new numerical model to couple a
Navier-Stokes incompressible fluid with a Gross-Pitaevskii superfluid. Coupling
terms in the global system of equations involve new definitions of the
following concepts: the regularized superfluid vorticity and velocity fields,
the friction force exerted by quantized vortices to the normal fluid, the
covariant gradient operator in the Gross-Pitaevskii based on a slip velocity
respecting the dynamics of vortex lines in the normal fluid. A numerical
algorithm based on pseudo-spectral Fourier methods is presented for solving the
coupled system of equations.Finally, we numerically test and validate the new
numerical system against well-known benchmarks for the evolution in a normal
fluid of different types or arrangements of quantized vortices (vortex crystal,
vortex dipole and vortex rings). The new coupling model opens new possibilities
to revisit and enrich existing numerical results for complex quantum fluids.

  Self-supervised Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To eliminate the requirement of fully-labeled data for supervised model
training in traditional Federated Learning (FL), extensive attention has been
paid to the application of Self-supervised Learning (SSL) approaches on FL to
tackle the label scarcity problem. Previous works on Federated SSL generally
fall into two categories: parameter-based model aggregation (i.e., FedAvg,
applicable to homogeneous cases) or data-based feature sharing (i.e., knowledge
distillation, applicable to heterogeneous cases) to achieve knowledge transfer
among multiple unlabeled clients. Despite the progress, all of them inevitably
rely on some assumptions, such as homogeneous models or the existence of an
additional public dataset, which hinder the universality of the training
frameworks for more general scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel and general method named Federated Self-supervised Learning with
Feature-correlation based Aggregation (FedFoA) to tackle the above limitations
in a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving manner. Our insight is to
utilize feature correlation to align the feature mappings and calibrate the
local model updates across clients during their local training process. More
specifically, we design a factorization-based method to extract the
cross-feature relation matrix from the local representations. Then, the
relation matrix can be regarded as a carrier of semantic information to perform
the aggregation phase. We prove that FedFoA is a model-agnostic training
framework and can be easily compatible with state-of-the-art unsupervised FL
methods. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

performance degradation for accurately detecting and locating line segments
when motion blur occurs. While event data shows strong complementary
characteristics to images for minimal blur and edge awareness at high-temporal
resolution, potentially beneficial for reliable line segment recognition. To
robustly detect line segments over motion blurs, we propose to leverage the
complementary information of images and events. To achieve this, we first
design a general frame-event feature fusion network to extract and fuse the
detailed image textures and low-latency event edges, which consists of a
channel-attention-based shallow fusion module and a self-attention-based dual
hourglass module. We then utilize two state-of-the-art wireframe parsing

contribute a synthetic and a realistic dataset for line segment detection,
i.e., FE-Wireframe and FE-Blurframe, with pairwise motion-blurred images and

the proposed method. When tested on the real dataset, our method achieves 63.3%

PIDs, or their efficacy in using them. In this article we report on the results
of an online interactive test designed to elicit exploratory data about

explore recognition of PIDs and the extent to which researchers correctly apply
PIDs within digital scholarly ecosystems, as well as measure researchers'

and certainty across all participants, though statistically significant
disciplinary and academic job role differences were observed in some instances.
Uncertainty and confusion were found to exist in relation to dominant schemes
such as ORCID and DOIs, even when contextualized within real-world examples. We
also show researchers' perceptions of PIDs to be generally positive but that
disciplinary differences can be noted, as well as higher levels of aversion to
PIDs in specific use cases and negative perceptions where PIDs are measured on
an 'activity' semantic dimension. This work therefore contributes to our
understanding of academics' 'PID literacy' and should inform those designing

low-complexity iterative least-squares solvers are not directly applicable to
the NOMA scenario due to the presence of multi-user interference (MUI).
Motivated by this, in this paper we propose a low-complexity method for
equalization and detection for OTFS-NOMA. Our proposed method uses an iterative
process where in each iteration, an equalizer based on the least-squares with
QR factorization (LSQR) algorithm is followed by a novel reliability zone (RZ)
detection scheme which estimates the reliable symbols of the users and then
uses interference cancellation to remove MUI. We present numerical results
which demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, in terms of symbol
error rate (SER), to the existing MMSE-SIC benchmark scheme. Additionally, we
present results which illustrate that a judicious choice of RZ thresholds is
important for optimizing the performance of the proposed algorithm.

look for the target of interest by moving from coarse to fine-grained feedback.
However, existing methods merely focus on the latter, i.e., fine-grained
search, by harnessing positive and negative pairs during training. This
pair-based paradigm only considers the one-to-one distance between a pair of
specific points, which is not aligned with the one-to-many coarse-grained
retrieval process and compromises the recall rate. In an attempt to fill this
gap, we introduce a unified learning approach to simultaneously modeling the
coarse- and fine-grained retrieval by considering the multi-grained
uncertainty. The key idea underpinning the proposed method is to integrate
fine- and coarse-grained retrieval as matching data points with small and large
fluctuations, respectively. Specifically, our method contains two modules:
uncertainty modeling and uncertainty regularization. (1) The uncertainty
modeling simulates the multi-grained queries by introducing identically
distributed fluctuations in the feature space. (2) Based on the uncertainty
modeling, we further introduce uncertainty regularization to adapt the matching
objective according to the fluctuation range. Compared with existing methods,
the proposed strategy explicitly prevents the model from pushing away potential
candidates in the early stage and thus improves the recall rate. On the three
public datasets, \ie, FashionIQ, Fashion200k, and Shoes, the proposed method
has achieved +4.03%, + 3.38%, and + 2.40% Recall@50 accuracy over a strong

On some cool stars, flares tend to release substantially more energy compared

lines, aside from an enhancement and broadening, exhibit asymmetry in their
profile. Asymmetries with enhanced blue wings are often associated with the
presence of coronal mass ejections while the origin of the red asymmetries is
currently not well understood. A few mechanisms have been suggested but no
modeling has been performed yet. We observed the dMe star AD Leo using the

photometric light curves. In analogy with solar flares, we model the H$\alpha$
line emergent from an extensive arcade of cool flare loops and explain the
observed asymmetries using the concept of coronal rain. We solve the non-LTE
radiative transfer in H$\alpha$ within cool flare loops taking into account the
velocity distribution of individual rain clouds. For a flare occurring at the
center of the stellar disc, we then integrate radiation emergent from the whole
arcade to get the flux from the loop area. We observed two flares in the
H$\alpha$ line that exhibit red wing asymmetry corresponding to velocities up
to 50 km s$^{-1}$ during the gradual phase of the flare. Synthetic profiles
generated from the model of coronal rain have enhanced red wings quite

a particularly challenging problem. The reason is that for such narrow pores
the large surface-to-volume ratio amplifies the relevance of the nanoscopic
details and of the effective interactions at the interface with pore walls.
Close to the pore wall, there is no clear separation between the length scales
associated with molecular interactions, layering of the solvent at the
interface with the pore and the particle size. Therefore, the standard
hydrodynamic arguments may not apply and alternative solutions to determining
average transport coefficients need to be developed. We here address this
problem by offering a multiscale ansatz that uses effective potentials
determined from molecular dynamics simulations to parametrise a four state
stochastic model for the positional configuration of the particle in the pore.
This is in turn combined with diffusivities in the centre of the pore and at
the pore wall to calculate the average diffusion constant. We apply this model
to the diffusion of fullerenes in a toluene filled slit nanopore and calculate
the mean diffusion coefficient as a function of the pore size. We show that the
accuracy of our model is affected by the partial slip of the toluene on the

expected value using stochastic samples. There exists an alternative
interpretation in calculus where Monte Carlo integration can be seen as
estimating a \emph{constant} function -- from the stochastic evaluations of the
integrand -- that integrates to the original integral. The integral mean value
theorem states that this \emph{constant} function should be the mean (or
expectation) of the integrand. Since both interpretations result in the same
estimator, little attention has been devoted to the calculus-oriented
interpretation. We show that the calculus-oriented interpretation actually
implies the possibility of using a more \emph{complex} function than a
\emph{constant} one to construct a more efficient estimator for Monte Carlo
integration. We build a new estimator based on this interpretation and relate
our estimator to control variates with least-squares regression on the
stochastic samples of the integrand. Unlike prior work, our resulting estimator
is \emph{provably} better than or equal to the conventional Monte Carlo
estimator. To demonstrate the strength of our approach, we introduce a
practical estimator that can act as a simple drop-in replacement for
conventional Monte Carlo integration. We experimentally validate our framework

today's society due to our sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits. As a
result, national and international organisms have made numerous efforts to
promote healthier food diets and physical activity habits. However, these
recommendations are sometimes difficult to follow in our daily life and they
are also based on a general population. As a consequence, a new area of
research, personalised nutrition, has been conceived focusing on individual
solutions through smart devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods.
  This study presents the AI4Food-NutritionDB database, the first nutrition
database that considers food images and a nutrition taxonomy based on
recommendations by national and international organisms. In addition, four
different categorisation levels are considered following nutrition experts: 6
nutritional levels, 19 main categories (e.g., ""Meat""), 73 subcategories (e.g.,
""White Meat""), and 893 final food products (e.g., ""Chicken""). The
AI4Food-NutritionDB opens the doors to new food computing approaches in terms
of food intake frequency, quality, and categorisation. Also, in addition to the
database, we propose a standard experimental protocol and benchmark including
three tasks based on the nutrition taxonomy (i.e., category, subcategory, and
final product) to be used for the research community. Finally, we also release
our Deep Learning models trained with the AI4Food-NutritionDB, which can be
used as pre-trained models, achieving accurate recognition results with
challenging food image databases.

community. Asking questions is a natural way to respond to photos and promote
awareness. However, most answers to questions in traditional question-answering
(QA) datasets are factoids, which reduce individuals' willingness to answer.
Furthermore, traditional visual question generation (VQG) confines the source
data for question generation to single images, resulting in a limited ability
to comprehend time-series information of the underlying event. In this paper,
we propose generating engaging questions from multiple images. We present MVQG,
a new dataset, and establish a series of baselines, including both end-to-end
and dual-stage architectures. Results show that building stories behind the
image sequence enables models to generate engaging questions, which confirms
our assumption that people typically construct a picture of the event in their
minds before asking questions. These results open up an exciting challenge for
visual-and-language models to implicitly construct a story behind a series of
photos to allow for creativity and experience sharing and hence draw attention
to downstream applications.

infinite-temperature thermalization induced by a sequence of repeated quantum
projective measurements, interspersed by a unitary (Hamiltonian) evolution.
Specifically, on a qubit and two-qubit systems, we test the state convergence
of a monitored quantum system in the limit of a large number of quantum
measurements, depending on the non-commutativity of the Hamiltonian and the
measurement observable. In most cases, where the Hamiltonian and observable do
not commute, the convergence is uniform towards the infinite-temperature state.
Conversely, whenever the two operators have one or more eigenvectors in common
in their spectral decomposition, the state of the monitored system converges
differently in the subspaces spanned by the measurement observable eigenstates.
As a result, we experimentally show that the convergence does not tend to a
completely mixed (infinite-temperature) state, but to a block-diagonal state in
the observable basis, with a finite effective temperature in each measurement
subspace. Finally, we quantify the effects of the quantum hardware noise on the
experimental data by modelling them by means of depolarizing quantum channels.

  Classification Models","Submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The development of data-driven heart sound classification models has been an
active area of research in recent years. To develop such data-driven models in
the first place, heart sound signals need to be captured using a signal
acquisition device. However, it is almost impossible to capture noise-free
heart sound signals due to the presence of internal and external noises in most
situations. Such noises and degradations in heart sound signals can potentially
reduce the accuracy of data-driven classification models. Although different
techniques have been proposed in the literature to address the noise issue, how
and to what extent different noise and degradations in heart sound signals
impact the accuracy of data-driven classification models remains unexplored. To
answer this question, we produced a synthetic heart sound dataset including
normal and abnormal heart sounds contaminated with a large variety of noise and
degradations. We used this dataset to investigate the impact of noise and
degradation in heart sound recordings on the performance of different
classification models. The results show different noises and degradations
affect the performance of heart sound classification models to a different
extent; some are more problematic for classification models, and others are
less destructive. Comparing the findings of this study with the results of a
survey we previously carried out with a group of clinicians shows noise and
degradations that are more detrimental to classification models are also more
disruptive to accurate auscultation. The findings of this study can be
leveraged to develop targeted heart sound quality enhancement approaches -
which adapt the type and aggressiveness of quality enhancement based on the
characteristics of noise and degradation in heart sound signals.

negligible momentum recoil when interacting with nanometer-sized samples, as a
consequence of the ultra-short interaction time. Accordingly, modeling fast
electrons as classical point-charges provides extremely accurate theoretical
predictions of energy-loss spectra. Here we investigate the aloof interaction
of nanometer-sized electron beams of few keV with micron-sized samples, a
regime where the classical description generally fails due to significant
wavefunction broadening and momentum recoil. To cope with these effects, we use
macroscopic quantum electrodynamics to analytically derive a generalized
expression for the electron energy loss probability which accounts for recoil.
Quantum features of the interaction are shown to get dramatically strong as the
interaction length is increased and/or the electron kinetic energy is
decreased. Moreover, relatively large values of the energy loss probability are
found at higher energy losses and larger impact parameters, a marked quantum
effect which is classically forbidden by the evanescent profile of the field
produced by a moving point-charge.

region by region, operations such as managing power flows require spatially
coherent joint forecasts, which account for cross-regional dependencies. Here
we forecast the joint distribution of net-demand across the 14 regions
constituting Great Britain's electricity network. Joint modelling is
complicated by the fact that the net-demand variability within each region, and
the dependencies between regions, vary with temporal, socio-economical and
weather-related factors. We accommodate for these characteristics by proposing
a multivariate Gaussian model based on a modified Cholesky parametrisation,
which allows us to model each unconstrained parameter via an additive model.
Given that the number of model parameters and covariates is large, we adopt a
semi-automated approach to model selection, based on gradient boosting. In
addition to demonstrating that adopting a covariate-dependent covariance matrix
model leads to substantial forecasting performance improvements, comparable to
those obtained by using a full rather than a diagonal static covariance matrix,
we explore the model output via accumulated local effects and other visual
tools to get insights into how the covariates affect net-demand variability and

simple closed orbits span a natural $A_\infty$-subcategory, the orbit category
of the flow. We show that it does not satisfy Abouzaid's generation criterion;
it is moreover ""very large"", in the sense that is not split-generated by any

points of a Morse function play the role of the orbits. For the domain

of its potential applications in intelligent video systems. Existing
unsupervised VAD methods tend to learn normality from training sets consisting
of only normal videos and regard instances deviating from such normality as
anomalies. However, they often consider only local or global normality in the
temporal dimension. Some of them focus on learning local spatiotemporal
representations from consecutive frames to enhance the representation for
normal events. But powerful representation allows these methods to represent
some anomalies and causes miss detection. In contrast, the other methods are
devoted to memorizing prototypical normal patterns of whole training videos to
weaken the generalization for anomalies, which also restricts them from
representing diverse normal patterns and causes false alarm. To this end, we
propose a two-branch model, Local-Global Normality Network (LGN-Net), to
simultaneously learn local and global normality. Specifically, one branch
learns the evolution regularities of appearance and motion from consecutive
frames as local normality utilizing a spatiotemporal prediction network, while
the other branch memorizes prototype features of the whole videos as global
normality by a memory module. LGN-Net achieves a balance of representing normal

fused normality enables LGN-Net to generalize to various scenes more than
exploiting single normality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and

transportation applications like autonomous driving or drone delivery. But for
large-scale scenes, compact synchronized RGB-D cameras are not applicable due
to limited sensing range, and using separate RGB and depth sensors inevitably
leads to unsynchronized sequences. Inspired by the recent success of
self-calibrating radiance field training methods that do not require known
intrinsic or extrinsic parameters, we propose the first solution that
self-calibrates the mismatch between RGB and depth frames. We leverage the
important domain-specific fact that RGB and depth frames are actually sampled
from the same trajectory and develop a novel implicit network called the
time-pose function. Combining it with a large-scale radiance field leads to an
architecture that cascades two implicit representation networks. To validate
its effectiveness, we construct a diverse and photorealistic dataset that
covers various RGB-D mismatch scenarios. Through a comprehensive benchmarking
on this dataset, we demonstrate the flexibility of our method in different
scenarios and superior performance over applicable prior counterparts. Codes,

components. Network slicing for O-RAN can significantly improve performance.
Therefore, an advanced resource allocation solution for network slicing in
O-RAN is proposed in this study by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL). This
research demonstrates an RL compatible simplified edge network simulator with
three components, user equipment(UE), Edge O-Cloud, and Regional O-Cloud. This
simulator is later used to discover how to improve throughput for targeted

Increasing the throughput for certain network slicing can also benefit the end

equatorial sources with complex emission profiles and time variability. To
demonstrate its capabilities, we use AART to simulate a black hole movie of a
stochastic, non-stationary, non-axisymmetric equatorial source; by
time-averaging the visibility amplitude of each snapshot, we are able to
extract the projected diameter of the photon ring and recover the shape

challenging core tasks in the medical and research world. Innovations and
revolutions of Computer Vision with Deep learning methods offer great promise
for fast and accurate diagnosis of screening and detection from chest X-Ray
images (CXR). This work presents rapid detection of diseases in the lung using
the efficient Deep learning pre-trained RepVGG algorithm for deep feature
extraction and classification. We performed automatic classification of X-Ray
images into three categories as Covid-19, Pneumonia, and Normal X-Ray cases.
For evaluation, first, we used a histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) to detect
the shape of the region of interest (ROI). We used the ROI object to improve
the detection accuracy for lung extraction, followed by data pre-processing and
augmentation. Then a pre-trained RepVGG model is used for deep feature
extraction and classification, similar to VGG and ResNet convolutional neural
network for the training-time and inference-time architecture transformed from
the multi to the flat mode by a structural re-parameterization technique. Next,
using the Computer Vision technique, we created a feature map and superimposed
it on the original images. We used this technique for the automatic highlighted
detection of affected areas of people's lungs. Based on the X-Ray images, we
developed an algorithm that classifies X-Ray images with height accuracy and
power faster thanks to the architecture transformation of the model. We compare
deep learning frameworks' accuracy and detection of disease. The study shows
the high power of deep learning methods for X-Ray images based on COVID-19
detection utilizing chest X-Ray. The proposed framework shows better diagnostic
accuracy by comparing popular deep learning models, i.e., VGG, ResNet50,
inceptionV3, DenseNet, and InceptionResnetV2.

most salient features of a sample. Some widely used methods are based on a
theoretical framework called Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD), which formalizes
the recursive application of the Taylor Theorem to the network's layers.
However, recent work has found these methods to be independent of the network's
deeper layers and appear to respond only to lower-level image structure. Here,
we investigate the DTD theory to better understand this perplexing behavior and
found that the Deep Taylor Decomposition is equivalent to the basic
gradient$\times$input method when the Taylor root points (an important
parameter of the algorithm chosen by the user) are locally constant. If the
root points are locally input-dependent, then one can justify any explanation.
In this case, the theory is under-constrained. In an empirical evaluation, we
find that DTD roots do not lie in the same linear regions as the input -
contrary to a fundamental assumption of the Taylor theorem. The theoretical
foundations of DTD were cited as a source of reliability for the explanations.
However, our findings urge caution in making such claims.

accumulates in reverse order a list of new vertices. In the second stage, the
$n$-th bisection, the method uses the reversed list to cast the bisected

bisection. In the final stage, beyond the $n$-th bisection, the method switches
to newest vertex bisection. To allow this switch, after the second stage, we
check that under uniform bisection the mesh simplices are conformal and

bisection scheme guaranteeing key advantages for local refinement. Finally, the
results show that the proposed bisection is well-suited for local refinement of

on one particle has no effect on the measurement of the second particle, we
show that Alice and Bob can find directions in which the result of their
measurement on the spin of the particle is always maximized. In other word, the
state of the particle is a eigenstate for the operator that is applied in that
direction, so the sum of the spins of two particles can have a maximum value.
We will argue that in entangled states, due to the effect of particle
measurement results on each other, Alice and Bob cannot find the desired
operators. Therefore, in the measurement, the total spin of the particles will
always be less than the mentioned maximum But we ask them to try and measure in
directions that will get the most value. Because this value is maximum for
separable states and minimum for fully entangled states, and for the rest of
the states, it will be proportional to the degree of entanglement between the
two maximum and minimum values, we set this parameter as We called it
""separability index"". Then, based on this index, the measure of entanglement
was introduced and extended to states with higher dimensions. In the end,
examples of qubit states and di-qubit states and di-qubit states were
investigated and the efficiency of the measure was confirmed by the results of
the examples.

do not consider the practical scenario where only small batch sizes are allowed
during training. QCBMs trained with a statistical two-sample test objective in
the image space require large amounts of projective measurements to approximate
the model distribution well, unpractical for large-scale quantum systems due to
the exponential scaling of the probability space. QCBMs trained adversarially
against a deep neural network discriminator are proof-of-concept models that
face mode collapse. In this work we investigate practical learning of QCBMs. We
use the information-theoretic \textit{Maximal Coding Rate Reduction} (MCR$^2$)
metric as a second moment matching tool and study its effect on mode collapse
in QCBMs. We compute the sampling based gradient of MCR$^2$ with respect to
quantum circuit parameters with or without an explicit feature mapping. We
experimentally show that matching up to the second moment alone is not
sufficient for training the quantum generator, but when combined with the class
probability estimation loss, MCR$^2$ is able to resist mode collapse. In
addition, we show that adversarially trained neural network kernel for infinite
moment matching is also effective against mode collapse. On the Bars and

  https://github.com/midusi/LSA-T",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sign language translation (SLT) is an active field of study that encompasses
human-computer interaction, computer vision, natural language processing and
machine learning. Progress on this field could lead to higher levels of
integration of deaf people. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge,
the first continuous Argentinian Sign Language (LSA) dataset. It contains
14,880 sentence level videos of LSA extracted from the CN Sordos YouTube
channel with labels and keypoints annotations for each signer. We also present
a method for inferring the active signer, a detailed analysis of the
characteristics of the dataset, a visualization tool to explore the dataset and
a neural SLT model to serve as baseline for future experiments.

Evaluation of UAP properties","13 pages,34 figures, Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies",,,,"physics.pop-ph astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NASA commissioned a research team to study Unidentified Aerial Phenomena
(UAP), observations of events that cannot scientifically be identified as known
natural phenomena. The Main Astronomical Observatory of NAS of Ukraine conducts
an independent study of UAP also. For UAP observations, we used two meteor
stations installed in Kyiv and in the Vinarivka village in the south of the
Kyiv region. Two-side monitoring of the daytime sky led to the detection of two
luminous objects at an altitude of 620 and 1130 km, moving at a speed of 256
and 78 km/s. Colorimetric analysis showed that the objects are dark: B - V =
1.35, V - R = 0.23. The size of objects is estimated to be more than 100
meters. The detection of these objects is an experimental fact. Estimates of
their characteristics follow from observational data. The authors do not
interpret these objects. Daytime sky monitoring in Kyiv with multi-color DSLR
camera at a rate of 30 frames per second in August and September 2018 and in
Vinarivka with a multi-color CMOS camera in October 2022 revealed several cases
of dark objects (phantoms). The time of their existence is, as a rule, a
fraction of a second. These are oval-shaped objects ranging in size from 20 to
100 meters with speeds from 2 to 30 km/s.

as a testbed to quickly implement novel algorithms and compare their results
with existing ones. However, the package also already includes implementations
of established algorithms for those who only need to solve a QMKP as part of
their research.

trade-offs of HPC scale Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more specifically
Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. For this task we developed benchmark-tracker, a
benchmark tool to evaluate the speed and energy consumption of DL algorithms in
HPC environments. We exploited hardware counters and Python libraries to
collect energy information through software, which enabled us to instrument a
known AI benchmark tool, and to evaluate the energy consumption of numerous DL
algorithms and models. Through an experimental campaign, we show a case example
of the potential of benchmark-tracker to measure the computing speed and the
energy consumption for training and inference DL algorithms, and also the
potential of Benchmark-Tracker to help better understanding the energy behavior
of DL algorithms in HPC platforms. This work is a step forward to better
understand the energy consumption of Deep Learning in HPC, and it also
contributes with a new tool to help HPC DL developers to better balance the HPC
infrastructure in terms of speed and energy consumption.

  dataset",,,,,"physics.geo-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reliable prediction of river floods in the first 72 hours can reduce harm
because emergency agencies have sufficient time to prepare and deploy for help
at the scene. Such river flood prediction models already exist and perform
relatively well in most high-income countries. But, due to the limited
availability of data, these models are lacking in low-income countries. Here,
we offer the first global river flood prediction framework based on the newly
published Caravan dataset. Our framework aims to serve as a benchmark for
future global river flood prediction research. To support generalizability
claims we include custom data evaluation splits. Further, we propose and
evaluate a novel two-path LSTM architecture (2P-LSTM) against three baseline
models. Finally, we evaluate the generated models on different locations in
Africa and Asia that were not part of the Caravan dataset.

  Main Commodities","22 pages",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Global warming has been changing the planet climate pattern. Carbon emission
is one of the big potentials to push the greenhouse gas effect which
contributes to global warming. Indonesia has strengthened its climate
commitments through NDC with equitable emission reduction targets and
strengthened alignment between climate goals and country development goals. The
Ministry of State Own Enterprise (SOE) deploys Plantation Company Holding, PTPN
for calculating detailed GHG emissions. PTPN is the largest plantation holding
company in Indonesia with great potential in carbon credits in the carbon
market. Currently, the GHG Calculator that can be applied is only RSPO and
Sugarcane, while the existing GHG Calculator commodities are not products from
PTPN. In addition, for a specific country such as Indonesia, a special
calculator is needed that is adjusted to the ISO standard and the GHG Protocol
and regulations that apply in Indonesia. Therefore, a GHG Calculator is needed
that can be used for multi-commodities in Indonesia, especially for commodities
native to Indonesia. The method used is based on ISO 14064 on GHG Emissions.
This study focuses on GHG assessment up to the harvesting of the crop (farm
gate); that is, it covers GHG emissions from plantation production and the
associated inputs.

  http://www.ml4h.cc, 9 pages",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Electronic health records (EHR) are widely believed to hold a profusion of
actionable insights, encrypted in an irregular, semi-structured format, amidst
a loud noise background. To simplify learning patterns of health and disease,
medical codes in EHR can be decomposed into semantic units connected by
hierarchical graphs. Building on earlier synergy between Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), we
present H-BERT, which ingests complete graph tree expansions of hierarchical
medical codes as opposed to only ingesting the leaves and pushes patient-level
labels down to each visit. This methodology significantly improves prediction
of patient membership in over 500 medical diagnosis classes as measured by
aggregated AUC and APS, and creates distinct representations of patients in
closely related but clinically distinct phenotypes.

  ""Cyber Crime in Social Media: Theory and Solutions""",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since personal computers became widely available in the consumer market, the
amount of harmful content on the internet has significantly expanded. In simple
terms, harmful content is anything online which causes a person distress or
harm. It may include hate speech, violent content, threats, non-hope speech,
etc. The online content must be positive, uplifting and supportive. Over the
past few years, many studies have focused on solving this problem through hate
speech detection, but very few focused on identifying hope speech. This paper
discusses various machine learning approaches to identify a sentence as Hope
Speech, Non-Hope Speech, or a Neutral sentence. The dataset used in the study
contains English YouTube comments and is released as a part of the shared task
""EACL-2021: Hope Speech Detection for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion"".
Initially, the dataset obtained from the shared task had three classes: Hope
Speech, non-Hope speech, and not in English; however, upon deeper inspection,
we discovered that dataset relabeling is required. A group of undergraduates
was hired to help perform the entire dataset's relabeling task. We experimented
with conventional machine learning models (such as Na\""ive Bayes, logistic
regression and support vector machine) and pre-trained models (such as BERT) on
relabeled data. According to the experimental results, the relabeled data has
achieved a better accuracy for Hope speech identification than the original
data set.
