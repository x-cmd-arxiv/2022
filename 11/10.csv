different temporal and spatial patterns emerging in our cities. These streets
are often represented as graphs where intersections are modelled as nodes and
streets as links between them. Previous work has shown that raster
representations of the original data can be created through a learning
algorithm on low-dimensional representations of the street networks. In
contrast, models that capture high-level urban network metrics can be trained
through convolutional neural networks. However, the detailed topological data
is lost through the rasterisation of the street network. The models cannot
recover this information from the image alone, failing to capture complex
street network features. This paper proposes a model capable of inferring good
representations directly from the street network. Specifically, we use a
variational autoencoder with graph convolutional layers and a decoder that
outputs a probabilistic fully-connected graph to learn latent representations
that encode both local network structure and the spatial distribution of nodes.
We train the model on thousands of street network segments and use the learnt
representations to generate synthetic street configurations. Finally, we
proposed a possible application to classify the urban morphology of different
network segments by investigating their common characteristics in the learnt
space.

classification of the emerging structures was carried out ``by hand'', we have
used this time machine learning concepts, notably based on a principal
component analysis and a $k$-means clustering approach: using a 30-dimensional
feature vector for each emerging structure (containing relevant information,
such as the composition of the configuration as well as the most relevant order
parameters) we were able to re-analyse these ground state configurations in a
considerably more systematic and comprehensive manner than we could possibly do
in the previously published classification scheme. Indeed we were now able to
identify new structures in previously unclassified regions of the parameter
space and could considerably refine the previous classification scheme,
identifying thereby a rich wealth of new emerging ground state configurations.
Thorough consistency checks confirm the validity of the newly defined diagram
of states.

decade: support for this programming pattern is available in many popular
languages via libraries and native language implementations, typically in the
form of coroutines or the async/await construct. Instead of programming via
shared memory, this concept assumes implicit synchronization through message
passing. The key data structure enabling such communication is the rendezvous
channel. Roughly, a rendezvous channel is a blocking queue of size zero, so
both send(e) and receive() operations wait for each other, performing a
rendezvous when they meet. To optimize the message passing pattern, channels
are usually equipped with a fixed-size buffer, so send(e)-s do not suspend and
put elements into the buffer until its capacity is exceeded. This primitive is
known as a buffered channel.
  This paper presents a fast and scalable algorithm for both rendezvous and
buffered channels. Similarly to modern queues, our solution is based on an
infinite array with two positional counters for send(e) and receive()
operations, leveraging the unconditional Fetch-And-Add instruction to update
them. Yet, the algorithm requires non-trivial modifications of this classic
pattern, in order to support the full channel semantics, such as buffering and
cancellation of waiting requests. We compare the performance of our solution to
that of the Kotlin implementation, as well as against other academic proposals,
showing up to 9.8x speedup. To showcase its expressiveness and performance, we
also integrated the proposed algorithm into the standard Kotlin Coroutines
library, replacing the previous channel implementations.

Lyapunov exponent was calculated by the Jacobian determinant. We found that the
angular momenta of charged particles nearby the black hole affect the position
of the equilibrium orbit as well as the Lyapunov exponent. When the charge is
large enough and the angular momenta take particular values, the bound is
violated at a certain distance from the event horizon. Concurrently, we
compared the differences by analyzing tables and figures after taking different
values of $\eta$, where $\eta$ is a constant indicating the nature of the
electromagnetic field. When $\eta=1$, it corresponds to the
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m-AdS black hole (RN-AdS black hole) and it
represents the phantom AdS black hole when $\eta=-1$. In this way, we can draw
the following conclusions. Under different values of $\eta$, the variation
trends of curves related to $\lambda^{2}-\kappa^{2}$ could be different, where
it can be judged whether the constraint is violated by determining if
$\lambda^{2}-\kappa^{2}$ is greater than zero. In addition, the corresponding
numerical values of angular momenta violating the bound in the phantom AdS
black hole are much smaller than the case of RN-AdS black hole. But cases in
these different black holes have the same rules to violate the bound. The large
absolute values of charge and $\Lambda$ are more likely to violate the bound.

generalization and strengthening of the well-studied minimum-cost spanning tree
(MST) problem. While the round complexity of distributedly computing the latter
has been well-understood, the former remains mostly open, especially as soon as
$k\geq 3$.
  In this paper, we present the first distributed algorithm that computes an
approximation of $k$-ECSS in sublinear time for general $k$. Concretely, we
describe a randomized distributed algorithm that, in
$\tilde{O}(k(D+k\sqrt{n}))$ rounds, computes a $k$-edge-connected spanning
subgraph whose cost is within an $O(\log n\log k)$ factor of optimal. Here, $n$
and $D$ denote the number of vertices and diameter of the graph, respectively.
This time complexity is nearly optimal for any $k=poly(\log n)$, almost
matching an $\tilde{\Omega}(D+\sqrt{n/k})$ lower bound. Our algorithm is the
first to achieve a sublinear round complexity for $k\geq 3$. We note that this
case is considerably more challenging than the well-studied and well-understood
$k=1$ case -- better known as MST -- and the closely related $k=2$ case.
  Our algorithm is based on reducing the $k$-ECSS problem to $k$ set cover
instances, in which we gradually augment the connectivity of the spanning
subgraph. To solve each set cover instance, we combine new structural
observations on minimum cuts with graph sketching ideas. One key ingredient in
our algorithm is a novel structural lemma that allows us to compress the
information about all minimum cuts in a graph into a succinct representation,
which is computed in a decentralized fashion. We hope that this succinct
representation may find applications in other computational settings or for
other problems.

many types of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although cardiac magnetic resonance
images (CMRI) are often acquired in patients with CVD, there are currently no
tools to automatically identify and quantify PAT from CMRI. The aim of this
study was to create a neural network to segment PAT from T2-weighted CMRI and
explore the correlations between PAT volumes (PATV) and CVD outcomes and
mortality. Methods: We trained and tested a deep learning model, PAT-CNN, to
segment PAT on T2-weighted cardiac MR images. Using the segmentations from
PAT-CNN, we automatically calculated PATV on images from 391 patients. We
analysed correlations between PATV and CVD diagnosis and 1-year mortality
post-imaging. Results: PAT-CNN was able to accurately segment PAT with Dice
score/ Hausdorff distances of 0.74 +- 0.03/27.1 +- 10.9~mm, similar to the
values obtained when comparing the segmentations of two independent human
observers ($0.76 +- 0.06/21.2 +- 10.3~mm$). Regression models showed that,
independently of sex and body-mass index, PATV is significantly positively
correlated with a diagnosis of CVD and with 1-year all cause mortality (p-value
< 0.01). Conclusions: PAT-CNN can segment PAT from T2-weighted CMR images
automatically and accurately. Increased PATV as measured automatically from
CMRI is significantly associated with the presence of CVD and can independently
predict 1-year mortality.

the reduction potential $H^{+}$ to $H_2$, whereas the highest value of the
semiconductor valence band (VBM) must be more negative than the oxidation
potential of $H_2O$ to $O_2$. Thus, band alignment studies in interfaces of
semiconductors with water become of vital importance. In this work, first
principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in the all

Besides the Berezinski-Koterlitz-Thouless transition, a magnetic-field-driven
SIT is observed in those two-dimensional (2D) superconducting films (2.6 nm
$\lesssim t \lesssim 4.0$ nm). Interestingly, it is found that the
low-temperature magnetoresistance isotherms do not cross at a single fixed

dynamical critical exponent obtained by analyzing these magnetoresistance

behavior of the dynamical critical exponent, originating from quenched disorder

input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. This is a
practically motivated setting where the learner wants to find an approximate
representation of an unknown quantum process, without having control on the
classical inputs that govern the process itself, e.g., in learning astronomical
processes, studying disordered systems and biological processes not controlled
by the observer. We provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in
this setting with a finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is
infinite. To do this, we review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow
tomography and hypothesis selection, and combine their guarantees with the
uniform convergence on the data of the loss functions of interest. As a
by-product we obtain sufficient conditions for performing shadow tomography of
classical-quantum states with a number of copies which depend only on the
dimension of the quantum register. We give concrete examples of processes that
can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or physically
motivated scenarios like systems subject to Hamiltonians with random
perturbations or data-dependent phase-shifts.

differentially private counting in the continual release model as a subroutine
(Google AI blog titled ""Federated Learning with Formal Differential Privacy
Guarantees""). In this case, a concrete bound on the error is very relevant to
reduce the privacy parameter. The standard mechanism for continual counting is
the binary mechanism. We present a novel mechanism and show that its mean
squared error is both asymptotically optimal and a factor 10 smaller than the
error of the binary mechanism. We also show that the constants in our analysis
are almost tight by giving non-asymptotic lower and upper bounds that differ
only in the constants of lower-order terms. Our algorithm is a matrix mechanism
for the counting matrix and takes constant time per release. We also use our
explicit factorization of the counting matrix to give an upper bound on the
excess risk of the private learning algorithm of Denisov et al. (NeurIPS 2022).
Our lower bound for any continual counting mechanism is the first tight lower
bound on continual counting under approximate differential privacy. It is
achieved using a new lower bound on a certain factorization norm, denoted by
$\gamma_F(\cdot)$, in terms of the singular values of the matrix. In
particular, we show that for any complex matrix, $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times
n}$, \[ \gamma_F(A) \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}\|A\|_1, \] where $\|\cdot \|$
denotes the Schatten-1 norm.
  We believe this technique will be useful in proving lower bounds for a larger
class of linear queries. To illustrate the power of this technique, we show the
first lower bound on the mean squared error for answering parity queries.

framework is based on the generation of Discord Questions: questions with a
diverse answer pool, explicitly illustrating source differences. To assemble a
prototype of the framework, we focus on two components: (1) discord question
generation, the task of generating questions answered differently by sources,
for which we propose an automatic scoring method, and create a model that
improves performance from current question generation (QG) methods by 5%, (2)
answer consolidation, the task of grouping answers to a question that are
semantically similar, for which we collect data and repurpose a method that
achieves 81% balanced accuracy on our realistic test set. We illustrate the
framework's feasibility through a prototype interface. Even though model
performance at discord QG still lags human performance by more than 15%,
generated questions are judged to be more interesting than factoid questions
and can reveal differences in the level of detail, sentiment, and reasoning of

more frequently for the rectangular cavity flow occurring in practical
problems, and some flow characteristics about rectangular cavity have not been

Boltzmann Method (LBM) is employed to simulate the lid-driven flow in a
two-dimensional rectangular cavity in this paper. First, the code is validated
for the standard square cavity, the velocity profiles, stream function values
and center positions of the primary and second vortexes at different Re are
presented and compared with previous researches. Then, the eddy dynamics of
rectangular cavities is simulated and discussed with Reynolds number (Re) in
the range of 4000-8000 and vertical to horizontal axis ratio (Ar) varied from
0.4 to 2.0, and the streamline and center migration of the primary vortex are
drawn realistically for rectangular cavity. In the end, the steady, periodic,
aperiodic and unstable phenomenon in the rectangular cavity is produced by LBM,
Re and Ar which play the significant role in the state transition of lid-driven
rectangular cavity flow are analyzed and summarized in detail. By the LBM
numerical simulation with 500x(500*Ar) grid, we have discovered that the flow
state in the rectangular cavity with a fixed Ar changes monotonically from
stable state, periodic state to aperiodic and unstable state with the increase
of Re, while the flow state in the rectangular cavity with a fixed Re varies
non-monotonically with the increase of Ar. Additionally, the cycle length of
periodic states varies with the change of Ar and Re.

clean energy. To further advance the understanding of soil-structure
interaction in energy piles, recently-derived analytical solutions have been
implemented to investigate the impact of stratigraphy on the soil-structure
interaction. This was accomplished by comparing the measured and predicted head
displacements, axial strains and stresses in an energy pile embedded in the
actual homogeneous and layered soil profiles, as well as into synthetic
homogeneous soil profiles. The analytical solutions for homogeneous soil
profile captured the smooth experimentally observed response versus depth very
well. In the case of a layered soil profile, the corresponding analytical model
was capable of capturing nuances in trends of axial stress and strain versus
depth at the interface of different layers. The analytical predictions for the
layered profile appear to be slightly less accurate than for the homogenous
profile. The experimental data obtained from the layered profile appear to be a
bit more scattered than those from the homogeneous profile. In the former case,
the interplay of the individual soil layers with the pile occurs while
maintaining the continuity of the pile stress and displacement at the interface
of different layers. The response throughout each layer of the layered profile
is quantitatively different than the corresponding homogeneous response.
Nevertheless, qualitatively the response throughout each layer of the layered
profile is similar to the response of the pile embedded in the corresponding
homogeneous layer.

We present high sensitivity and high-spectral resolution NOEMA
observations of the Class 0/I binary system SVS13A, composed of the low-mass
protostars VLA4A and VLA4B with a separation of ~90 au. VLA4A is undergoing an
accretion burst that enriches the chemistry of the surrounding gas. This gives
us an excellent opportunity to probe the chemical and physical conditions as
well as the accretion process. Methods. We observe the (12K-11K) lines of CH3CN
and CH313CN, the DCN (3-2) line, and the C18O (2-1) line toward SVS13A using
NOEMA. Results. We find complex line profiles at disk scales which cannot be
explained by a single component or pure Keplerian motion. By adopting two
velocity components to model the complex line profiles, we find that the
temperatures and densities are significantly different between these two
components. This suggests that the physical conditions of the emitting gas
traced via CH3CN can change dramatically within the circumbinary disk. In
addition, combining our observations of DCN (3-2) with previous ALMA
high-angular-resolution observations, we find that the binary system (or VLA4A)
might be fed by an infalling streamer from envelope scales (~700 au). If this
is the case, this streamer contributes to the accretion of material onto the
system with a rate of at least 1.4x10-6 Msun yr-1. Conclusions. We conclude
that the CH3CN emission in SVS13A traces hot gas from a complex structure. This
complexity might be affected by a streamer that is possibly infalling and
funneling material into the central region.

in light collection systems for particle physics experiments. In noble element
systems, it is often coated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) to allow detection
of vacuum ultraviolet scintillation light. In this work this dependence is
investigated for PTFE coated with TPB in air for light of wavelengths of
200~nm, 260~nm, and 450~nm. The results show that TPB-coated PTFE has a
reflectance of approximately 92\% for thicknesses ranging from 5~mm to 10~mm at
450~nm, with negligible variation as a function of thickness within this range.
A cross-check of these results using an argon chamber supports the conclusion
that the change in thickness from 5~mm to 10~mm does not affect significantly
the light response at 128~nm. Our results indicate that pieces of TPB-coated
PTFE thinner than the typical 10~mm can be used in particle physics detectors
without compromising the light signal.

of non-equilibrium processes, where the volume fractions of the oppositely
magnetized domains vary and perfectly compensate each other at the coercive
magnetic field. Here, we report on a fundamentally new pathway for
magnetization reversal that is mediated by an antiferromagnetic state.
Consequently, an atomic-scale compensation of the magnetization is realized at
the coercive field, instead of the mesoscopic or macroscopic domain
cancellation in canonical reversal processes. We demonstrate this unusual
magnetization reversal on the Zn-doped polar magnet Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. Hidden
behind the conventional ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop, the surprising emergence
of the antiferromagnetic phase at the coercive fields is disclosed by a sharp
peak in the field-dependence of the electric polarization. In addition, at the
magnetization reversal our THz spectroscopy studies reveal the reappearance of
the magnon mode that is only present in the pristine antiferromagnetic state.
According to our microscopic calculations, this unusual process is governed by
the dominant intralayer coupling, strong easy-axis anisotropy and spin
fluctuations, which result in a complex interplay between the ferrimagnetic and
antiferromagnetic phases. Such antiferro-state-mediated reversal processes
offer novel concepts for magnetization control, and may also emerge for other
ferroic orders.

increasing amount of digital textual data that modern computing systems

document indexing. This paper proposes a simple but effective
post-processing-based universal approach to improve the performance of any AKE
methods, via an enhanced level of semantic-awareness supported by PoS-tagging.
To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, we considered word
types retrieved from a PoS-tagging step and two representative sources of
semantic information -- specialised terms defined in one or more
context-dependent thesauri, and named entities in Wikipedia. The above three
steps can be simply added to the end of any AKE methods as part of a
post-processor, which simply re-evaluate all candidate keywords following some
context-specific and semantic-aware criteria. For five state-of-the-art (SOTA)
AKE methods, our experimental results with 17 selected datasets showed that the
proposed approach improved their performances both consistently (up to 100\% in
terms of improved cases) and significantly (between 10.2\% and 53.8\%, with an
average of 25.8\%, in terms of F1-score and across all five methods),
especially when all the three enhancement steps are used. Our results have
profound implications considering the ease to apply our proposed approach to

recognition performance. However, in some cases, the rectification network
generates unnecessary distortions on images, resulting in incorrect predictions
in images that would have otherwise been correct without it. In order to
alleviate the unnecessary distortions, the portmanteauing of features is
proposed. The portmanteau feature, inspired by the portmanteau word, is a
feature containing information from both the original text image and the
rectified image. To generate the portmanteau feature, a non-linear input
pipeline with a block matrix initialization is presented. In this work, the
transformer is chosen as the recognition network due to its utilization of
attention and inherent parallelism, which can effectively handle the

decision on a system's remaining life cycle. Consequently, this introduces a
degree of complexity that in most cases can only be solved through an

integration of system design decisions and operational decisions during each
stage of a system's life cycle. This perspective has two advantages: (i)
improved system performance as more effective decisions can be made, and (ii)
improved data efficiency as it provides a framework to utilize data from
multiple sources and design instances. From the formal definition, we identify
a set of eight capabilities that are vital constructs to bring about the
potential, as defined in this paper, that the digital twin concept holds for
the design of systems. Subsequently, by comparing these capabilities with the
available literature on digital twins, we identify a set of research questions

processing times and due dates on a single machine so as to minimize the total
processing time of tardy jobs, i.e., $1||\sum p_j U_j$. This problem was
identified by Bringmann et al. (Algorithmica 2022) as a natural
subquadratic-time special case of the classic $1||\sum w_j U_j$ problem, which
likely requires time quadratic in the total processing time $P$, because of a
fine-grained lower bound. Bringmann et al.~obtain their $\tilde{O}(P^{7/4})$
time scheduling algorithm through a new variant of convolution, dubbed Max-Min
Skewed Convolution, which they solve in $\tilde{O}(n^{7/4})$ time. Our main
technical contribution is a faster and simpler convolution algorithm running in
$\tilde{O}(n^{5/3})$ time. It implies an $\tilde{O}(P^{5/3})$ time algorithm
for $1||\sum p_j U_j$, but may also be of independent interest.
  Inspired by recent developments for the Subset Sum and Knapsack problems, we
study $1||\sum p_j U_j$ parameterized by the maximum job processing time
$p_{\max}$. With proximity techniques borrowed from integer linear programming
(ILP), we show structural properties of the problem that, coupled with a new
dynamic programming formulation, lead to an $\tilde{O}(n+p_{\max}^3)$ time
algorithm. Moreover, in the setting with multiple machines, we use similar
techniques to get an $n \cdot p_{\max}^{O(m)}$ time algorithm for $Pm||\sum p_j
U_j$.
  Finally, we point out that the considered problems exhibit a particular
triangular block structure in the constraint matrices of their ILP
formulations. In light of recent ILP research, a question that arises is
whether one can devise a generic algorithm for such a class of ILPs. We give a
negative answer to this question: we show that already a slight generalization
of the structure of the scheduling ILP leads to a strongly NP-hard problem.

strengthening during faster shearing. Effects in kaolin were generally of

The above combination extracts the features from OHD with DAE, and estimates
the posterior distribution of cosmological parameters with MAF. We ask whether
we can find a better tool to compress large data in order to gain better
results while constraining the cosmological parameters. Information maximising
neural networks, a kind of simulation-based machine learning technique, was
proposed at an earlier time. In a series of numerical examples, the results
show that IMNN can find optimal, non-linear summaries robustly. In this work,
we mainly compare the dimensionality reduction capabilities of IMNN and DAE. We
use IMNN and DAE to compress the data into different dimensions and set
different learning rates for MAF to calculate the posterior. Meanwhile, the
training data and mock OHD are generated with a simple Gaussian likelihood, the
spatially flat {\Lambda}CDM model and the real OHD data. To avoid the complex
calculation in comparing the posterior directly, we set different criteria to
compare IMNN and DAE.

introduces a Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence term that aligns the source and
target data distributions learned by the generators, thus overcoming the

this stochastic loss function, we show that our KL divergence term can be
implemented via a paired density discriminator. We term this new architecture a

emotion as a smooth and learnable deformation of the source prosodic features.
This approach provides implicit regularization that offers key advantages in

conduct rigorous experiments and comparative studies to demonstrate that our

(independent of the Knudsen number), the solution displays several dynamics
caused by the phase mixing/dispersive effects of the transport operator $v

$x$-wavenumbers $k$ with $|k|\gg\nu$, one sees an enhanced dissipation effect

almost-uniform phase mixing estimates. For macroscopic quantities as the

This multiscale method uses microscopic information derived on-the-fly to
provide the stress tensor of the momentum balance in a macroscale problem,
therefore bypassing the need for approximate constitutive relations for the
stress. We exploit the intrinsic multiscale features of SDPD to account for
thermal fluctuations as the characteristic size of the discretizing particles
decrease. We validate the LHMM using different flow configurations (reverse
Poiseuille flow, flow passing a cylinder array, and flow around a square
cavity) and fluid (Newtonian and non-Newtonian). We showed the framework's
flexibility to model complex fluids at the microscale using multiphase and
polymeric systems. We showed that stresses are adequately captured and passed
from micro to macro scales, leading to richer fluid response at the continuum.

determine the shear viscosity $\eta$ for a moderately dense granular binary
mixture of smooth hard spheres. The mixture is subjected to a simple shear flow
and heated by the action of an external driving force (Gaussian thermostat)
that exactly compensates the energy dissipated in collisions. The set of Enskog
kinetic equations is the starting point to obtain the dependence of $\eta$ on
the control parameters of the mixture: solid fraction, concentration, mass and
diameter ratios, and coefficients of normal restitution. While the expression
of $\eta$ found in the SM-theory is based on the assumption of Maxwellian
distributions for the velocity distribution functions of each species, the
GDH-theory solves the Enskog equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to
first order in the shear rate. To assess the accuracy of both kinetic theories,
the Enskog equation is numerically solved by means of the direct simulation
Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The simulation is carried out for a mixture under
simple shear flow, using the thermostat to control the cooling effects. Given
that the SM-theory predicts a vanishing kinetic contribution to the shear
viscosity, the comparison between theory and simulations is essentially made at
the level of the collisional contribution $\eta_c$ to the shear viscosity. The
results clearly show that the GDH-theory compares with simulations much better

to tackle the problem over lower-resource languages is currently infeasible.
Therefore, our work aims to investigate whether we can use existing datasets to
train models for predicting worthiness of verification of claims in tweets in
other languages. We present a systematic comparative study of six approaches
for cross-lingual check-worthiness estimation across pairs of five diverse
languages with the help of Multilingual BERT (mBERT) model. We run our
experiments using a state-of-the-art multilingual Twitter dataset. Our results
show that for some language pairs, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer is possible
and can perform as good as monolingual models that are trained on the target
language. We also show that in some languages, this approach outperforms (or at
least is comparable to) state-of-the-art models.

the Epoch of Reionisation must contend with systematic effects that make it
difficult to achieve sufficient dynamic range to separate the 21cm signal from
foreground emission and other effects. For instance, the instrument's chromatic
response modulates the otherwise spectrally smooth foregrounds, making them
difficult to model, while a significant fraction of the data must be excised
due to the presence of radio frequency interference (RFI), leaving gaps in the
data. Errors in modelling the (modulated and gappy) foregrounds can easily
generate spurious contamination of what should otherwise be 21cm
signal-dominated modes. Various approaches have been developed to mitigate
these issues by (e.g.) using non-parametric reconstruction of the foregrounds,
in-painting the gaps, and weighting the data to reduce the level of
contamination. We present a Bayesian statistical method that combines these
approaches, using the coupled techniques of Gaussian constrained realisations
(GCR) and Gibbs sampling. This provides a way of drawing samples from the joint
posterior distribution of the 21cm signal modes and their power spectrum in the
presence of gappy data and an uncertain foreground model in a computationally
scalable manner. The data are weighted by an inverse covariance matrix that is
estimated as part of the inference, along with a foreground model that can then
be marginalised over. We demonstrate the application of this technique on a
simulated HERA-like delay spectrum analysis, comparing three different
approaches for accounting for the foreground components.

but struggle with interpretability. One possible solution is sparsity: making
inference such that many of the parameters are estimated as being identically

$\ell_1$ penalty. However, the $\ell_1$ penalty introduces significant bias
when high sparsity is desired. In this article, we retain the $\ell_1$ penalty,
but define learnable penalty weights $\lambda_p$ endowed with hyperpriors. We
start the article by investigating the optimization problem this poses,
developing a proximal operator associated with the $\ell_1$ norm. We then study
the theoretical properties of this variable-coefficient $\ell_1$ penalty in the
context of penalized likelihood. Next, we investigate application of this
penalty to Variational Bayes, developing a model we call the Sparse Bayesian
Lasso which allows for behavior qualitatively like Lasso regression to be
applied to arbitrary variational models. In simulation studies, this gives us
the Uncertainty Quantification and low bias properties of simulation-based
approaches with an order of magnitude less computation. Finally, we apply our
methodology to a Bayesian lagged spatiotemporal regression model of internal

contrastive learning of medical images based on labels that can be extracted
from clinical data. In the medical field, there exists a variety of labels for
data that serve different purposes at different stages of a diagnostic and
treatment process. Clinical labels and biomarker labels are two examples. In
general, clinical labels are easier to obtain in larger quantities because they
are regularly collected during routine clinical care, while biomarker labels
require expert analysis and interpretation to obtain. Within the field of
ophthalmology, previous work has shown that clinical values exhibit
correlations with biomarker structures that manifest within optical coherence
tomography (OCT) scans. We exploit this relationship between clinical and
biomarker data to improve performance for biomarker classification. This is
accomplished by leveraging the larger amount of clinical data as pseudo-labels
for our data without biomarker labels in order to choose positive and negative
instances for training a backbone network with a supervised contrastive loss.
In this way, a backbone network learns a representation space that aligns with
the clinical data distribution available. Afterwards, we fine-tune the network
trained in this manner with the smaller amount of biomarker labeled data with a
cross-entropy loss in order to classify these key indicators of disease
directly from OCT scans. Our method is shown to outperform state of the art
self-supervised methods by as much as 5% in terms of accuracy on individual
biomarker detection.

difference between CoSANG and traditional semi-analytic models that are mainly
used for post-processing. By accounting for the gravitational effect of the

simulations. Moreover CoSANG can produce stellar halo populations via tagging
tracer dark matter particles. We demonstrate the performance and dynamical
accuracy of this approach using both controlled test simulations and a set of
three cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW) mass halos. We
simulate each target halo both without the coupling (dark matter only,
hereafter DMO) and with the coupling (CoSANG). We compare the internal
structure (subhalo distribution, shape and orientation) of the halos. The
following changes are observed in the CoSANG model compared to the DMO model:
1) the total number of subhaloes close to the center of the halo is reduced, 2)
the $V_{\mathrm{max}}$ distribution peaks at a lower value and lies below the

Specifically, ViT multi-head attention layers make it possible to embed
information globally across the overall image. Nevertheless, computing and
storing such attention matrices incurs a quadratic cost dependency on the
number of patches, limiting its achievable efficiency and scalability and
prohibiting more extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained
devices. Sparse attention has been shown to be a promising direction for
improving hardware acceleration efficiency for NLP models. However, a
systematic counterpart approach is still missing for accelerating ViT models.
To close the above gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind algorithm-hardware
codesigned framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, for boosting the inference efficiency of
ViTs. Unlike sparsity-based Transformer accelerators for NLP, ViTALiTy unifies
both low-rank and sparse components of the attention in ViTs. At the algorithm
level, we approximate the dot-product softmax operation via first-order Taylor
attention with row-mean centering as the low-rank component to linearize the
cost of attention blocks and further boost the accuracy by incorporating a
sparsity-based regularization. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated
accelerator to better leverage the resulting workload and pipeline from
ViTALiTy's linear Taylor attention which requires the execution of only the
low-rank component, to further boost the hardware efficiency. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTALiTy offers boosted
end-to-end efficiency (e.g., $3\times$ faster and $3\times$ energy-efficient)

massive amounts of world knowledge they internalize during pretraining. While
many downstream applications provide the model with an informational context to
aid its performance on the underlying task, how the model's world knowledge
interacts with the factual information presented in the context remains under
explored. As a desirable behavior, an LLM should give precedence to the context
whenever it contains task-relevant information that conflicts with the model's
memorized knowledge. This enables model predictions to be grounded in the
context, which can then be used to update or correct specific model predictions
without frequent retraining. By contrast, when the context is irrelevant to the

this paper, we undertake a first joint study of the aforementioned two

presence of water in planetary material can be inferred from the atmospheric

accrete before more refractory minerals reach the star. As a result, a white
dwarf's relative photospheric abundances may vary with time during a single

will be rare occurrences of accretion events with inferred volatile levels far
exceeding those of pristine comets. To observationally test these predictions,
we statistically constrain the water content of white dwarf pollutants. We find
that in the current sample, only three stars show statistically significant
evidence of water at the 2$\sigma$ level, due to large typical uncertainties in
atmospheric abundances and accretion states. In the future, an expanded sample
of polluted white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres will allow for the
corroboration of our theoretical predictions. Our work also shows the
importance of interpreting pollutant compositions statistically, and emphasizes
the requirement to reduce uncertainties on measured abundances to allow for

process, the composition of the material falling onto a star may vary with time
during the accretion of a single planetary body. Consequently, the
instantaneous photospheric abundances of white dwarfs do not necessarily
reflect the bulk composition of their pollutants, especially when their
diffusion timescales are short. In particular, we predict that when an asteroid
with an iron core tidally disrupts around a white dwarf, a larger share of its
mantle is ejected, and that the core/mantle fraction of the accreting material
varies with time during the event. Crucially, this implies that the core
fraction of differentiated pollutants cannot be determined for white dwarfs
with short diffusion timescales, which sample only brief episodes of longer
accretion processes. The observed population of polluted white dwarfs backs up
the proposed theory. More white dwarfs have accreted material with high Fe/Ca
than low Fe/Ca relative to stellar abundance ratios, indicating the ejection of
mantle material. Additionally, we find tentative evidence that the accretion
rate of iron decreases more rapidly than that of magnesium or calcium, hinting
at variability of the accreted composition. Further corroboration of the
proposed theory will come from the up-coming analysis of large samples of young

regulator of a galaxy's star-forming efficiency. Mass, energy, and metal
outflows ($\eta_M$, $\eta_E$, and $\eta_Z$, here normalized by the star
formation rate, the SNe energy and metal production rates, respectively) shape
galaxy properties by both ejecting gas and metals out of the galaxy and by
heating the circumgalactic medium (CGM), preventing future accretion.
Traditionally, models have assumed that galaxies self-regulate by ejecting a
large fraction of the gas which enters the interstellar medium (ISM), even
though such high mass-loadings are in growing tension with observations. To
better understand how the relative importance of ejective (i.e. high
mass-loading) vs preventative (i.e. high energy-loading) feedback affects the
present-day properties of galaxies, we develop a simple gas-regulator model of
galaxy evolution, where the stellar mass, ISM, and CGM are modeled as distinct
reservoirs which exchange mass, metals, and energy at different rates within a
growing halo. Focusing on the halo mass range from $10^{10}$ to $10^{12}
M_{\odot}$, we demonstrate that, with reasonable parameter choices, we can
reproduce the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the ISM-to-stellar mass
relation with low mass-loaded ($\eta_M \sim 0.1-10$) but high energy-loaded
($\eta_E \sim 0.1-1$) winds, with self-regulation occurring primarily through
heating and cooling of the CGM. We show that the model predictions are robust
against changes to the mass-loading of outflows but are quite sensitive to our
choice of the energy-loading, preferring $\eta_E \sim 1$ for the lowest mass

at intermediate radii, accretion at the smallest radii is dominated by hot
virialized gas at most times. The accretion rate scales with radius as
$\dot{M}\propto r^{1/2}$ when hot gas dominates and we obtain
$\dot{M}\simeq10^\mathrm{-4}-10^\mathrm{-3}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ near
the event horizon, similar to what is inferred from EHT observations. The
orientation of the cold gas disk can differ significantly on different spatial
scales. We propose a subgrid model for accretion in lower-resolution
simulations in which the hot gas accretion rate is suppressed relative to the
Bondi rate by $\sim (r_\mathrm{g}/r_{\rm Bondi})^{1/2}$. Our results can also
provide more realistic initial conditions for simulations of black hole
accretion at the event horizon scale.

well-defined classes. Changing-obscuration objects show strong variability of
the line-of-sight column density, mostly associated with clouds or outflows

supernova (SN Icn) 2022ann, the fifth member of its newly identified class of
SNe. Its early optical spectra are dominated by narrow carbon and oxygen
P-Cygni features with absorption velocities of 800 km/s; slower than other SNe
Icn and indicative of interaction with a dense, H/He-poor circumstellar medium
(CSM) that is outflowing slower than a typical Wolf-Rayet wind velocity of
$>$1000 km/s. We identify helium in NIR spectra obtained two weeks after
maximum and in optical spectra at three weeks, demonstrating that the CSM is
not fully devoid of helium. We never detect broad spectral features from SN
ejecta, including in spectra extending to the nebular phase, a unique
characteristic among SNe~Icn. Compared to other SNe Icn, SN 2022ann has a low
luminosity, with a peak o-band absolute magnitude of -17.7, and evolves slowly.
We model the bolometric light curve and find it is well-described by 1.7 M_Sun
of SN ejecta interacting with 0.2 M_sun of CSM. We place an upper limit of 0.04
M_Sun of Ni56 synthesized in the explosion. The host galaxy is a dwarf galaxy
with a stellar mass of 10^7.34 M_Sun (implied metallicity of log(Z/Z_Sun)
$\approx$ 0.10) and integrated star-formation rate of log(SFR) = -2.20
M_sun/yr; both lower than 97\% of the galaxies observed to produce
core-collapse supernovae, although consistent with star-forming galaxies on the
galaxy Main Sequence. The low CSM velocity, nickel and ejecta masses, and
likely low-metallicity environment disfavour a single Wolf-Rayet progenitor
star. Instead, a binary companion star is likely required to adequately strip
the progenitor before explosion and produce a low-velocity outflow. The low CSM
velocity may be indicative of the outer Lagrangian points in the stellar binary
progenitor, rather than from the escape velocity of a single Wolf-Rayet-like
massive star.

to the $\mathit{on\text{-}shell}$ enhancement, sizable effects are expected in
null tests of the SM, such as the flat term, $F_H$, of the $B\to K e^+ e^-$

X-ray observations of bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) hosted by rich

$\mathrm{log}(m_\mathrm{a}/\mathrm{eV}) < -12.0$. We evaluate the potential of
future X-ray observatories, particularly $Athena$ and the proposed $AXIS$, to
constrain ALPs via observations of cluster-hosted AGN, taking NGC 1275 in the
Perseus cluster as our exemplar. Assuming perfect knowledge of instrument
calibration, we show that a modest exposure (200-ks) of NGC 1275 by $Athena$
permits us to exclude all photon-ALP couplings $g_\mathrm{a\gamma} > 6.3 \times
10^{-14} \ {\mathrm{GeV}}^{-1}$ at the 95% level, as previously shown by
$Conlon \ et \ al. \ (2018)$, representing a factor of 10 improvement over
current limits. We then proceed to assess the impact of realistic calibration
uncertainties on the $Athena$ projection by applying a standard $Cash$
likelihood procedure, showing the projected constraints on $g_\mathrm{a\gamma}$
weaken by a factor of 10 (back to the current most sensitive constraints).
However, we show how the use of a deep neural network can disentangle the
energy-dependent features induced by instrumental miscalibration and those
induced by photon-ALP mixing, allowing us to recover most of the sensitivity to
the ALP physics. In our explicit demonstration, the machine learning applied
allows us to exclude $g_\mathrm{a\gamma} > 2.0 \times 10^{-13} \
{\mathrm{GeV}}^{-1}$, complementing the projected constraints of
next-generation ALP dark matter birefringent cavity searches for very-light
ALPs. Finally, we show that a 200-ks $AXIS$/on-axis observation of NGC 1275
will tighten the current best constraints on very-light ALPs by a factor of 3.

and expansion velocities, and are associated with mergers or common envelope
ejections in stellar binaries. Intermediate-luminosity red transients (ILRTs)
are an observationally similar class with unknown origins, but generally
believed to either be electron capture supernovae (ECSN) in super-AGB stars, or
outbursts in dusty luminous blue variables (LBVs). In this paper, we present a
systematic sample of 8 LRNe and 8 ILRTs detected as part of the Census of the
Local Universe (CLU) experiment on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The CLU
experiment spectroscopically classifies ZTF transients associated with nearby
($<150$ Mpc) galaxies, achieving 80% completeness for m$_{r}<20$\,mag. Using
the ZTF-CLU sample, we derive the first systematic LRNe volumetric-rate of
7.8$^{+6.5}_{-3.7}\times10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the luminosity range
$-16\leq$M$_{\rm{r}}$$\leq -11$ mag. We find that in this luminosity range, the
LRN rate scales as dN/dL $\propto L^{-2.5\pm0.3}$ - significantly steeper than
the previously derived scaling of $L^{-1.4\pm0.3}$ for lower luminosity LRNe
(M$_{V}\geq-10$). The steeper power law for LRNe at high luminosities is
consistent with the massive merger rates predicted by binary population
synthesis models. We find that the rates of the brightest LRNe (M$_{r}\leq-13$
mag) are consistent with a significant fraction of them being progenitors of
double compact objects (DCOs) that merge within a Hubble time. For ILRTs, we
derive a volumetric rate of $2.6^{+1.8}_{-1.4}\times10^{-6}$
Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for M$_{\rm{r}}\leq-13.5$, that scales as dN/dL $\propto
L^{-2.5\pm0.5}$. This rate is $\approx1-5\%$ of the local core-collapse
supernova rate, and is consistent with theoretical ECSN rate estimates.

$\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ measurements in the worst case, whereas PNR and
photon-parity detection require $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ measurements in the worst
case (both up to logarithmic corrections). We benchmark these results against
numerical simulation as well as experimental data from optical homodyne
experiments. We find that numerical and experimental homodyne tomography
significantly outperforms our bounds, exhibiting a more typical scaling of the
number of measurements that is close to linear in $N$. We extend our
single-mode results to an efficient construction of multimode shadows based on
local measurements.

the existing quantum corrections in classical simulations through Feynman-Hibbs

the polar caps, should populate the magnetosphere, allowing detection of

from text. Conventional efforts mainly focus on the supervised setting.
However, these supervised models cannot generalize to event types out of the
pre-defined ontology. To fill this gap, many efforts have been devoted to the
zero-shot EE problem. This paper follows the trend of modeling event-type
semantics but moves one step further. We argue that using the static embedding
of the event type name might not be enough because a single word could be
ambiguous, and we need a sentence to define the type semantics accurately. To
model the definition semantics, we use two separate transformer models to
project the contextualized event mentions and corresponding definitions into
the same embedding space and then minimize their embedding distance via
contrastive learning. On top of that, we also propose a warming phase to help
the model learn the minor difference between similar definitions. We name our
approach Zero-shot Event extraction with Definition (ZED). Experiments on the
MAVEN dataset show that our model significantly outperforms all previous
zero-shot EE methods with fast inference speed due to the disjoint design.
Further experiments also show that ZED can be easily applied to the few-shot
setting when the annotation is available and consistently outperforms baseline
supervised methods.

These hold for translation invariant systems under great generality, including

the experimental platforms use nonlinear crystals to generate single photons
through Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion processes, even if this kind of
approach is intrinsically probabilistic leading to scalability issues for
increasing number of qudits. Semiconductors Quantum Dots (QDs) have been used
to get over these limitations being able to produce on demand pure and

exploited to create OAM modes. Our work employs a bright QD single-photon
source to generate a complete set of quantum states for information processing

certify the preparation of such a type of qudit states by means of the
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect visibility which furnishes the pairwise overlap between
consecutive OAM-encoded photons. Then, we investigate the hybrid inter-particle

the distribution of dipole in the wave function (gluon multiplicity
distribution) asymptotically satisfies the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling,
with a non-trivial scaling function $f(z)$ with $z=\frac n{\bar n}$. The
scaling function decays exponentially as $2(2.55)^2ze^{-\frac{z}{0.3917}}$ at
large $z$, while its growth is log-normal as $e^{-\frac{1}{2}\ln^2 z}$ for
small-$z$. A detailed analysis of the Fourier-Laplace transform of $f(z)$,
allows for performing the inverse Fourier transform, and access the
non-asymptotic bulk-region around the peak. The bulk and asymptotic results are
shown to be in good agreement with the measured hadronic multiplicities in DIS,
as reported by the H1 collaboration at HERA in the region of large $Q^2$. A
numerical tabulation of $f(z)$ is included. Remarkably, the same scaling
function is found to emerge in the resummation of double logarithms in the
evolution of jets. Using the generating function approach, we show why this is
the case. The absence of KNO scaling in non-critical and super-renormalizable
theories is briefly discussed. We also discuss the universal character of the
entanglement entropy in the KNO scaling limit, and its measurement using the

difficulty: either allowing randomized algorithms, in the static setting (where
they should err with bounded probability on the worst case stream); or when
only deterministic and infallible algorithms are required. Some recent works
have considered the adversarial setting, in which a randomized streaming
algorithm must succeed even on data streams provided by an adaptive adversary
that can see the intermediate outputs of the algorithm.
  In order to better understand the differences between these models, we study
a streaming task called ""Missing Item Finding"". In this problem, for $r < n$,
one is given a data stream $a_1,\ldots,a_r$ of elements in $[n]$, (possibly
with repetitions), and must output some $x \in [n]$ which does not equal any of
the $a_i$. We prove that, for $r = n^{\Theta(1)}$ and $\delta =
1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$, the space required for randomized algorithms that solve
this problem in the static setting with error $\delta$ is
$\Theta(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$; for algorithms in the adversarial setting with
error $\delta$, $\Theta((1 + r^2 / n) \mathrm{polylog}(n))$; and for
deterministic algorithms, $\Theta(r / \mathrm{polylog}(n))$. Because our
adversarially robust algorithm relies on free access to a string of $O(r \log
n)$ random bits, we investigate a ""random start"" model of streaming algorithms
where all random bits used are included in the space cost. Here we find a
conditional lower bound on the space usage, which depends on the space that
would be needed for a pseudo-deterministic algorithm to solve the problem. We
also prove an $\Omega(r / \mathrm{polylog}(n))$ lower bound for the space
needed by a streaming algorithm with $< 1/2^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$ error
against ""white-box"" adversaries that can see the internal state of the

the function on the space of affine hyperplanes equal to volumes cut by these
hyperplanes from the domain. The study of these functions originates from the
works of Archimedes and Newton and is closely related to the theory of lacunas
of hyperbolic partial differential equations.The volume functions are regular
at the hyperplanes of general position with respect to the boundary of the cut
domain. We study their behavior at the non-regular hyperplanes, which are
either tangent to the boundary of the domain at its finite points or have
asymptotic direction. In both cases the local regularity of the restriction of
the volume function to a local connected component of the set of regular planes
depends on the triviality of a certain relative homology class, the
(generalized) even Petrovsky class. In the first case (of finite tangencies)
the study of these classes and enumeration of components of regularity (so
called local lacunas) at simple singularities of wave fronts was essentially
done by V. A. Vassiliev; it is formulated in terms of deformations of simple
real function singularities. We show that the analogous study for asymptotic
hyperplanes is related in the same way with the study of boundary function
singularities. We define and calculate local Petrovsky classes for this case
and find lacunas, i.e. the local components of the complement of corresponding
discriminant in which all local Petrovsky classes are trivial. If component is
not lacuna we prove that the corresponding volume function cannot be algebraic.
Also we calculate the local monodromy groups, describing the ramification of
volume functions.

(insertions-only), $\mathit{decremental}$ (deletions-only), or $\mathit{fully}$
$\mathit{dynamic}$ (both insertions and deletions). Fully dynamic is the holy
grail of dynamic algorithm design; it is obviously more general than the other
two, but is it strictly harder? Several works managed to reduce fully dynamic
to the incremental or decremental models by taking advantage of either specific
structure of the incremental/decremental algorithms (e.g. [HK99, HLT01, BKS12,
ADKKP16, BS80, OL81, OvL81]), or specific order of insertions/deletions (e.g.
[AW14,HKNS15,KPP16]). Our goal in this work is to get a black-box
fully-to-incremental reduction that is as general as possible. We find that the
following conditions are necessary:
  $\bullet$ The incremental algorithm must have a worst-case (rather than
amortized) running time guarantee.
  $\bullet$ The reduction must work in what we call the
$\mathit{deletions}$-$\mathit{look}$-$\mathit{ahead}$ $\mathit{model}$, where
the order of deletions among current elements is known in advance. A notable
practical example is the ""sliding window"" (FIFO) order of updates.
  Under those conditions, we design:
  $\bullet$ A simple, practical, amortized-fully-dynamic to
worst-case-incremental reduction with a $\log(T)$-factor overhead on the
running time, where $T$ is the total number of updates.
  $\bullet$ A theoretical worst-case-fully-dynamic to worst-case-incremental

interviewing codes such as chit-chat and inappropriate to account for the
unique conversational patterns observed on online platforms. We automate the
process of labeling peer-counselor responses to MI techniques by fine-tuning
large domain-specific language models and then use these automated measures to
investigate the behavior of the peer counselors via correlational studies.
Specifically, we study the impact of MI techniques on the conversation ratings
to investigate the techniques that predict clients' satisfaction with their
counseling sessions. When counselors use techniques such as reflection and
affirmation, clients are more satisfied. Examining volunteer counselors' change
in usage of techniques suggest that counselors learn to use more introduction

different judges and filters for the edge deletion. We also introduce a

innovative network thinking, teaching complexity science, and exploring
emergent phenomena. This paper reports on our recent development of the
deterministic random walk model in NetLogo, a leading platform for
computational thinking, eco-system thinking, and multi-agent cross-platform
programming environment. The deterministic random walk is foundational to
modeling dynamical processes on complex networks. Inspired by the temporal
visualizations offered in NetLogo, we investigated the relationship between
network topology and diffusion saturation time for the deterministic random
walk model. Our analysis uncovers that in Erdos-Renyi graphs, the saturation
time exhibits an asymmetric pattern with a considerable probability of
occurrence. This behavior occurs when the hubs, defined as nodes with
relatively higher number of connections, emerge in Erdos-Renyi graphs. Yet, our
analysis yields that the Barabasi-Albert model hubs stabilize the the
convergence time of the deterministic random walk model. These findings
strongly suggest that depending on the dynamical process running on complex
networks, complementing characteristics other than the degree need to be taken
into account for considering a node as a hub. We have made our development

provide a detailed characterization of the associated Sobolev spaces, trace

important role in the analysis of $A_{\eta, \tau, \lambda}$. We make a
substantial step towards more rough interaction supports $\Sigma$ and consider
general compact Lipschitz hypersurfaces. We derive conditions for the
interaction strengths such that the operators $A_{\eta, \tau, \lambda}$ are
self-adjoint, obtain a Krein-type resolvent formula, and characterize the
essential and discrete spectrum. These conditions include purely Lorentz scalar

confinement case, the latter having an important application in the
mathematical description of graphene. Using a certain ordinary boundary triple,
we show the self-adjointness of $A_{\eta, \tau, \lambda}$ for arbitrary
combinations of the interaction strengths (including critical ones) under the
condition that $\Sigma$ is $C^{\infty}$-smooth and derive its spectral
properties. In particular, in the critical case, a loss of Sobolev regularity

as a photonic heat pump. In this work, we study the thermodynamic performance
of such a photonic heat engine and pump via the fluctuational electrodynamics
formalism. The propulsion force due to the non-reciprocity and the drag force
due to the Doppler effect was revealed as the physical mechanism behind the

to understand the densities and compositions of planets unlike those in the
Solar System. Kepler-102, which consists of 5 tightly packed transiting
planets, is a particularly interesting system since it includes a super-Earth
(Kepler-102d) and a sub-Neptune-sized planet (Kepler-102e) for which masses can
be measured using radial velocities. Previous work found a high density for
Kepler-102d, suggesting a composition similar to that of Mercury, while
Kepler-102e was found to have a density typical of sub-Neptune size planets;
however, Kepler-102 is an active star, which can interfere with RV mass
measurements. To better measure the mass of these two planets, we obtained 111
new RVs using Keck/HIRES and TNG/HARPS-N and modeled Kepler-102's activity
using quasi-periodic Gaussian Process Regression. For Kepler-102d, we report a
mass upper limit of M$_{d} < $5.3 M$_{\oplus}$ [95\% confidence], a best-fit
mass of M$_{d}$=2.5 $\pm$ 1.4 M$_{\oplus}$, and a density of $\rho_{d}$=5.6
$\pm$ 3.2 g/cm$^{3}$ which is consistent with a rocky composition similar in
density to the Earth. For Kepler-102e we report a mass of M$_{e}$=4.7 $\pm$ 1.7
M$_{\oplus}$ and a density of $\rho_{e}$=1.8 $\pm$ 0.7 g/cm$^{3}$. These
measurements suggest that Kepler-102e has a rocky core with a thick gaseous
envelope comprising 2-4% of the planet mass and 16-50% of its radius. Our study
is yet another demonstration that accounting for stellar activity in stars with
clear rotation signals can yield more accurate planet masses, enabling a more
realistic interpretation of planet interiors.

flows of tensor fields defining $H$-reductions of the frame bundle, for a
closed and connected subgroup $H \subset \mathrm{SO}(n)$, on any connected and
oriented $n$-manifold with sufficient topology to admit such structures.
  The first part of the article sets up a unifying theoretical framework for
deformations of $H$-structures, by way of the natural infinitesimal action of
$\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ on tensors combined with various bundle
decompositions induced by $H$-structures. We compute evolution equations for
the intrinsic torsion under general flows of $H$-structures and, as
applications, we obtain general Bianchi-type identities for $H$-structures,
and, for closed manifolds, a general first variation formula for the
$L^2$-Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal{E}$ on the space of $H$-structures.
  We then specialise the theory to the negative gradient flow of $\mathcal{E}$
over isometric $H$-structures, i.e., their harmonic flow. The core result is an
almost monotonocity formula along the flow for a scale-invariant localised
energy, similar to the classical formulae by Chen--Struwe
\cites{Struwe1988,Struwe1989} for the harmonic map heat flow. This yields an
$\epsilon$-regularity theorem and an energy gap result for harmonic structures,
as well as long-time existence for the flow under small initial energy, with
respect to the $L^\infty$-norm of initial torsion, in the spirit of Chen--Ding
\cite{Chen-Ding1990}. Moreover, below a certain energy level, the absence of a
torsion-free isometric $H$-structure in the initial homotopy class imposes the
formation of finite-time singularities. These seemingly contrasting statements
are illustrated by examples on flat $n$-tori, so long as
$\pi_n(\mathrm{SO}(n)/H)\neq\{1\}$; e.g. when $n=7$ and $H=\rm G_2$, or $n=8$
and $H=\mathrm{Spin}(7)$.

short, very bright pulses are thought to originate near the light cylinder, at
$\sim\!1600{\rm\;km}$ from the pulsar. The pulsar's location inside the Crab
Nebula offers an unusual opportunity to resolve the emission regions, using the
nebula, which scatters radio waves, as a lens. We attempt to do this using a
sample of 61998 giant pulses found in coherently combined European VLBI network
observations at $18{\rm\;cm}$. These were taken at times of relatively strong
scattering and hence good effective resolution, and from correlations between
pulse spectra, we show that the giant pulse emission regions are indeed
resolved. We infer apparent diameters of $\sim\!2000$ and $\sim\!2400{\rm\;km}$
for the main and interpulse components, respectively, and show that with these
sizes the correlation amplitudes and decorrelation timescales and bandwidths
can be understood quantitatively, both in our observations and in previous
ones. Using pulse-spectra statistics and correlations between polarizations, we
also show that the nebula resolves the nanoshots that comprise individual giant
pulses. The implied diameters of $\sim\!1100{\rm\;km}$ far exceed light
travel-time estimates, suggesting the emitting plasma is moving
relativistically, with $\gamma\simeq10^{4}$, as inferred previously from
drifting bands during the scattering tail of a giant pulse. If so, the emission
happens over a region extended along the line of sight by
$\sim\!10^{7}{\rm\;km}$. We conclude that relativistic motion likely is
important for producing giant pulses, and may be similarly for other sources of
short, bright radio emission, such as fast radio bursts.

termed an ENZ photonic gap antenna (PGA), which consists of a dielectric pillar
within which a thin slab of indium tin oxide (ITO) material is embedded. In ENZ
PGAs, hybrid dielectric-ENZ modes emerge from strong coupling between the
dielectric antenna modes and the ENZ bulk plasmon resonance. These hybrid modes
efficiently couple to free space and allow for large enhancements of the
incident electric field over nearly an octave bandwidth, without the stringent
lateral nanofabrication requirements required by conventional plasmonic or
dielectric nanoantennas. The linear response of single ENZ PGAs is probed using
dark field scattering and interpreted using a simple coupled oscillator
framework. Third harmonic generation is used to probe the field enhancement and
large enhancements are observed in the THG efficiency over a broad spectral
range. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of ENZ PGAs, which we
have previously shown can support electric field enhancements of up to
100--200X, which is comparable with those of the best plasmonic antennas.

undertaking for humans, yet effective automation of the task remains highly
challenging. Recent metrics from the deep learning community commonly compare
image pairs during training to improve upon traditional metrics such as PSNR or
SSIM. However, current comparisons ignore the fact that image content affects
quality assessment as comparisons only occur between images of similar content.
This restricts the diversity and number of image pairs that the model is
exposed to during training. In this paper, we strive to enrich these
comparisons with content diversity. Firstly, we relax comparison constraints,
and compare pairs of images with differing content. This increases the variety
of available comparisons. Secondly, we introduce listwise comparisons to
provide a holistic view to the model. By including differentiable regularizers,
derived from correlation coefficients, models can better adjust predicted
scores relative to one another. Evaluation on multiple benchmarks, covering a
wide range of distortions and image content, shows the effectiveness of our

for all such matrices, and especially for some such matrices of particular
interest:
  - For any integer $q > 1$ and any matrix which is the Kronecker power of a
fixed $q \times q$ matrix, we construct a depth-2 circuit of size $O(N^{1.5 -

  - For the case $q=2$, i.e., for any matrix which is the Kronecker power of a
fixed $2 \times 2$ matrix, we construct a depth-2 circuit of size
$O(N^{1.446})$, improving the prior best size $O(N^{1.493})$ [Alman, 2021].
  - For the Walsh-Hadamard transform, we construct a depth-2 circuit of size
$O(N^{1.443})$, improving the prior best size $O(N^{1.476})$ [Alman, 2021].
  - For the disjointness matrix (the communication matrix of set disjointness,
or equivalently, the matrix for the linear transform that evaluates a
multilinear polynomial on all $0/1$ inputs), we construct a depth-2 circuit of

techniques use built-in sensors resulting in inaccurate results and increased
fabrication complexity. Exteroceptive methods so far rely on placing reflective
markers on all tracked components and triangulating their position using
multiple motion-tracking cameras. Tracking systems are expensive and infeasible
for deformable robots interacting with the environment due to marker occlusion
and damage. Here, we present a regression approach for 3D shape estimation
using a convolutional neural network. The proposed approach takes advantage of
data-driven supervised learning and is capable of real-time marker-less shape
estimation during inference. Two images of a robotic system are taken
simultaneously at 25 Hz from two different perspectives, and are fed to the
network, which returns for each pair the parameterized shape. The proposed
approach outperforms marker-less state-of-the-art methods by a maximum of 4.4\%
in estimation accuracy while at the same time being more robust and requiring
no prior knowledge of the shape. The approach can be easily implemented due to
only requiring two color cameras without depth and not needing an explicit
calibration of the extrinsic parameters. Evaluations on two types of soft
robotic arms and a soft robotic fish demonstrate our method's accuracy and
versatility on highly deformable systems in real-time. The robust performance

positron on target experiment, where Kaon beams can be achieved at around
$10^{7}$ per bunch crossing. Such Kaon beams are clean with small
contamination, and can have great physics potential on, e.g., hyperon searches
through Kaon nuclei collision, Kaon rare decay measurement, and Kaon proton or
Kaon lepton collisions. The same technique with very asymmetric electron
positron collisions can also be extended to other final states such as pions
and tau leptons.

the performance of our method is almost identical to a standard CNN approach,

vision-based algorithms hold great promise, as visual information can be
readily acquired by a robot's onboard sensors and provides a much richer source
of information from which deep neural networks can extract complex patterns.
Deep reinforcement learning has been used to achieve vision-based robot
navigation. However, the efficacy of these algorithms in environments with
dynamic obstacles and high variation in the configuration space has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we employ a deep Dyna-Q learning
algorithm for room evacuation and obstacle avoidance in partially observable
environments based on low-resolution raw image data from an onboard camera. We
explore the performance of a robotic agent in environments containing no
obstacles, convex obstacles, and concave obstacles, both static and dynamic.
Obstacles and the exit are initialized in random positions at the start of each
episode of reinforcement learning. Overall, we show that our algorithm and
training approach can generalize learning for collision-free evacuation of
environments with complex obstacle configurations. It is evident that the agent
can navigate to a goal location while avoiding multiple static and dynamic
obstacles, and can escape from a concave obstacle while searching for and
navigating to the exit.

We then show that homogeneous ODEs in the absence of both types of

conclusion that quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics work best. We
generalize our results to the inhomogeneous case and find that existing generic

algorithms that are amplifiers, meaning that they amplify the difference
between a pair of input quantum states. On the other hand, we show how to
fast-forward quantum algorithms for solving special classes of ODEs which leads

solutions relying on differential privacy guarantees are difficult to implement
correctly with reasonable accuracy, while ad-hoc solutions might contain

done by evaluating the accuracy of a wide range of privacy attacks. However,
existing attacks require time and expertise to develop, need to be manually
tailored to the specific systems attacked, and are limited in scope. In this
paper, we develop QuerySnout (QS), the first method to automatically discover
vulnerabilities in QBSes. QS takes as input a target record and the QBS as a
black box, analyzes its behavior on one or more datasets, and outputs a
multiset of queries together with a rule to combine answers to them in order to
reveal the sensitive attribute of the target record. QS uses evolutionary
search techniques based on a novel mutation operator to find a multiset of
queries susceptible to lead to an attack, and a machine learning classifier to
infer the sensitive attribute from answers to the queries selected. We showcase
the versatility of QS by applying it to two attack scenarios, three real-world
datasets, and a variety of protection mechanisms. We show the attacks found by
QS to consistently equate or outperform, sometimes by a large margin, the best
attacks from the literature. We finally show how QS can be extended to QBSes
that require a budget, and apply QS to a simple QBS based on the Laplace
mechanism. Taken together, our results show how powerful and accurate attacks
against QBSes can already be found by an automated system, allowing for highly
complex QBSes to be automatically tested ""at the pressing of a button"".

in the aftermath of a BNS merger -- provided the system avoids prompt collapse

quadrupolar oscillations and non-axisymmetric deformations. The post-merger
gravitational-wave spectrum possesses a characteristic peak frequency that has
been shown to be dependent on the binary chirp mass and the neutron star
equation of state (EoS), rendering post-merger gravitational waves a powerful
tool for constraining neutron star composition. Unfortunately, the BNS
post-merger signal is emitted at high ($\gtrsim 1.5$ kHz) frequencies, where
ground-based gravitational wave detectors suffer from reduced sensitivity. It
is therefore unlikely that post-merger signals will be detected with sufficient
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) until the advent of next-generation detectors.
However, by employing empirical relations derived from numerical relativity
simulations, we can combine information across an ensemble of BNS mergers,
allowing us to obtain EoS constraints with many low-SNR signals. We present a
hierarchical Bayesian method for deriving constraints on $R_{1.6}$, the radius
of a 1.6$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ neutron star, through an ensemble analysis of
binary neutron star mergers. We apply this method to simulations of the next

run at A+ sensitivity, demonstrating the potential of our approach to yield EoS

material was discovered to be flowing into Saturn's equatorial upper atmosphere

examined the consequences of this ring material on the chemistry of Saturn's
neutral and ionized atmosphere. We find that if a substantial fraction of this
material enters the atmosphere as vapor or becomes vaporized as the solid ring
particles ablate upon atmospheric entry, then the ring-derived vapor would
strongly affect the composition of Saturn's ionosphere and neutral
stratosphere. Our surveys of Cassini infrared and ultraviolet remote-sensing
data from the final few years of the mission, however, reveal none of these

inferred ring influx represents an anomalous, transient situation that was
triggered by some recent dynamical event in the ring system that occurred a few
months to a few tens of years before the 2017 end of the Cassini mission, or
(2) a large fraction of the incoming material must have been entering the

achieved in two ways: switching the mode actively by a motor, or combining

accurately forecast the dynamics of unknown chaotic dynamical systems.
Short-term predictions of the state evolution and long-term predictions of the
statistical patterns of the dynamics (``climate'') can be produced by employing
a feedback loop, whereby the model is trained to predict forward one time step,
then the model output is used as input for multiple time steps. In the absence
of mitigating techniques, however, this technique can result in artificially
rapid error growth. In this article, we systematically examine the technique of
adding noise to the ML model input during training to promote stability and
improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce Linearized Multi-Noise
Training (LMNT), a regularization technique that deterministically approximates
the effect of many small, independent noise realizations added to the model
input during training. Our case study uses reservoir computing, a
machine-learning method using recurrent neural networks, to predict the
spatiotemporal chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We find that reservoir
computers trained with noise or with LMNT produce climate predictions that
appear to be indefinitely stable and have a climate very similar to the true
system, while reservoir computers trained without regularization are unstable.
Compared with other regularization techniques that yield stability in some
cases, we find that both short-term and climate predictions from reservoir
computers trained with noise or with LMNT are substantially more accurate.
Finally, we show that the deterministic aspect of our LMNT regularization
facilitates fast hyperparameter tuning when compared to training with noise.

developed a contact area variable surface (CAVS), whose friction changed
according to the load. However, only our fundamental results were previously
presented, with detailed analyses not provided. In this study, we first
investigated the CAVS friction anisotropy, and demonstrated that the
longitudinal direction exhibited a larger ratio of friction change. Next, we
proposed a sensible CAVS, capable of providing a variable-friction mechanism,
and tested its sensing and control systems in operations requiring switching
between sliding and stable-grasping modes. Friction sensing was performed using
an embedded camera, and we developed a gripper using the sensible CAVS,
considering the CAVS friction anisotropy. In CAVS, the low-friction mode
corresponds to a small grasping force, while the high-friction mode corresponds
to a greater grasping force. Therefore, by controlling only the friction mode,
the gripper mode can be set to either the sliding or stable-grasping mode.
Based on this feature, a methodology for controlling the contact mode was
constructed. We demonstrated a manipulation involving sliding and stable
grasping, and thus verified the efficacy of the developed sensible CAVS.

discrete-time quantum walks having an arbitrary position-dependent coin
operator. The position of the walker is encoded in base 2: with $n$ wires, each
corresponding to one qubit, we encode $2^n$ position states. The data necessary
to define an arbitrary position-dependent coin operator is therefore
exponential in $n$.
  We first propose a circuit implementing the position-dependent coin operator,
that is naive, in the sense that it has exponential depth and implements
sequentially all appropriate position-dependent coin operators. We then propose
a circuit that ""transfers"" all the depth into ancillae, yielding a final depth
that is linear in $n$ at the cost of an exponential number of ancillae. The
main idea of this linear-depth circuit is to implement in parallel all coin
operators at the different positions.
  Finally, we extend the result of Ref. [2] from position-dependent unitaries
which are diagonal in the position basis to position-dependent $2 \times
2$-block-diagonal unitaries: indeed, we show that for a position dependence of
the coin operator (the block-diagonal unitary) which is smooth enough, one can
find an efficient quantum-circuit implementation approximating the coin
operator up to an error $\epsilon$ (in terms of the spectral norm), the depth
and size of which scale as $O(1/\epsilon)$.
  A typical application of the efficient implementation would be the quantum
simulation of a relativistic spin-1/2 particle on a lattice, coupled to a
smooth external gauge field; notice that recently, quantum spatial-search
schemes have been developed which use gauge fields as the oracle, to mark the
vertex to be found [3, 4]. A typical application of the linear-depth circuit
would be when there is spatial noise on the coin operator (and hence a
non-smooth dependence in the position).

\ll n^{3/2}$. Similar ""statistical-computational gaps"" occur in many
high-dimensional inference tasks, and in recent years there has been a flurry
of work on explaining the apparent computational hardness in these problems by
proving lower bounds against restricted (yet powerful) models of computation
such as statistical queries (SQ), sum-of-squares (SoS), and low-degree

largely because its hardness does not appear to be explained by a ""planted

  We consider a model for random order-3 tensor decomposition where one
component is slightly larger in norm than the rest (to break symmetry), and the
components are drawn uniformly from the hypercube. We resolve the computational
complexity in the LDP model: $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial functions of the

evidence suggesting that the best known algorithms for tensor decomposition

other cosmological simulations, we find a population of quenched, isolated

largely responsible for the quenched, isolated dwarfs, while isolated dwarfs
without an MBH are consistent with quiescent fractions observed in the field.
Quenching occurs between $z=0.5-1$, during which the available supply of
star-forming gas is heated or evacuated by MBH feedback. Mergers or
interactions seem to play little to no role in triggering the MBH feedback. At
low stellar masses, $M_{\rm star} \lesssim 10^{9.3} M_\odot$, quenching
proceeds across several Gyr as the MBH slowly heats up gas in the central
regions. At higher stellar masses, $M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 10^{9.3} M_\odot$,
quenching occurs rapidly within $1$ Gyr, with the MBH evacuating gas from the
central few kpc of the galaxy and driving it to the outskirts of the halo. Our
results indicate the possibility of substantial star formation suppression via
MBH feedback within dwarf galaxies in the field. On the other hand, the
apparent over-quenching of dwarf galaxies due to MBH suggests higher resolution
and/or better modeling is required for MBHs in dwarfs, and quenched fractions
offer the opportunity to constrain current models.

Khot-Minzer-Safra (FOCS 2015) gave a non-adaptive, one-sided tester making

friends than their friends do. Prior work has shown how the friendship paradox
can lead to perception biases regarding behaviors that correlate with the
number of friends: for example, people tend to perceive their friends as being
more socially engaged than they are. Here, we investigate the consequences of
this type of social comparison in the conceptual setting of content creation
(""sharing"") in an online social network. Suppose people compare the amount of
feedback that their content receives to the amount of feedback that their
friends' content receives, and suppose they modify their sharing behavior as a
result of that comparison. How does that impact overall sharing on the social
network over time? We run simulations over model-generated synthetic networks,
assuming initially uniform sharing and feedback rates. Thus, people's initial
modifications of their sharing behavior in response to social comparisons are
entirely driven by the friendship paradox. These modifications induce
inhomogeneities in sharing rates that can further alter perception biases. If
people's responses to social comparisons are monotonic (i.e., the larger the
disparity, the larger the modification in sharing behavior), our simulations
suggest that overall sharing in the network gradually declines. Meanwhile,
convex responses can sustain or grow overall sharing in the network. We focus
entirely on synthetic graphs in the present work and have not yet extended our
simulations to real-world network topologies. Nevertheless, we do discuss
practical implications, such as how interventions can be tailored to sustain
long-term sharing, even in the presence of adverse social-comparison effects.

enlarges the vortex size. A sufficiently large $T$ can further result in an
oscillating flow, consistent with the experimental observation. In addition, a
global stability analysis of the steady blade-plate EHD flow is conducted. The
global mode is detailedly characterised at different values of $T$. When $T$ is

set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, in the model of dynamic geometric streams,
where the input $X\subseteq [\Delta]^d$ is presented as a sequence of point
insertions and deletions. Previously, Frahling and Sohler [STOC 2005] designed
a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the low-dimensional regime, i.e.,
it uses space $\exp(d)$.
  To tackle this problem in the high-dimensional regime, which is of growing
interest, one must improve the dependence on the dimension $d$, ideally to
space complexity $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1} d \log\Delta)$. Lammersen,
Sidiropoulos, and Sohler [WADS 2009] proved that Euclidean Max-Cut admits
dimension reduction with target dimension $d' = \mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1})$.
Combining this with the aforementioned algorithm that uses space $\exp(d')$,
they obtain an algorithm whose overall space complexity is indeed polynomial in
$d$, but unfortunately exponential in $\epsilon^{-1}$.
  We devise an alternative approach of \emph{data reduction}, based on
importance sampling, and achieve space bound $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1} d

dimension-reduction approach. To implement this scheme in the streaming model,
we employ a randomly-shifted quadtree to construct a tree embedding. While this
is a well-known method, a key feature of our algorithm is that the embedding's
distortion $O(d\log\Delta)$ affects only the space complexity, and the

chemiluminescence effects resulting from the vibrationally excited NO produced
by N($^2$D, $^4$S) + O$_2$. The model utilizes globally averaged solar fluxes
between 0.05-175 nm as the primary form of energy input, parameterized using
the F10.7 index to reflect variations over the course of a solar cycle. The
model also includes joule heating effects, magnetospheric fluxes, and a
parameterized treatment of photoelectron effects as secondary heating sources.
The energy inputs are balanced by radiative losses from the neutral
thermosphere in the form of infrared emissions from CO$_2$, NO and O($^3$P).
Atmospheric profiles are generated for a solar cycle, and are compared with
empirical model results as well as observational data. On average, calculated
exospheric temperatures are within 10% of MSIS values, while peak electron
densities are within a factor of 2 of IRI values. The model is shown to
reproduce the NO peak at 106 km, and densities within 25% of globally averaged

condition called Bellman completeness in order to successfully operate
off-policy with function approximation, unless additional conditions are met.
However, Bellman completeness is a requirement that is much stronger than
realizability and that is deemed to be too strong to hold in practice. In this
work, we relax this structural assumption and analyze the statistical
complexity of off-policy reinforcement learning when only realizability holds
for the prescribed function class.
  We establish finite-sample guarantees for off-policy reinforcement learning
that are free of the approximation error term known as inherent Bellman error,
and that depend on the interplay of three factors. The first two are well
known: they are the metric entropy of the function class and the
concentrability coefficient that represents the cost of learning off-policy.
The third factor is new, and it measures the violation of Bellman completeness,
namely the mis-alignment between the chosen function class and its image
through the Bellman operator.
  In essence, these error bounds establish that off-policy reinforcement
learning remains statistically viable even in absence of Bellman completeness,
and characterize the intermediate situation between the favorable Bellman
complete setting and the worst-case scenario where exponential lower bounds are
in force. Our analysis directly applies to the solution found by temporal
difference algorithms when they converge.

understanding of condensed matter systems and harbour exotic phenomena
promising to address major technological challenges. Considerable understanding
of these phases of matter has been gained recently by considering additional
protecting symmetries, different types of quasiparticles, and systems out of
equilibrium. Here, we show that symmetries could be enforced not just on full
Hamiltonians, but also on their components. We construct a large class of
previously unidentified multiplicative topological phases of matter
characterized by tensor product Hilbert spaces similar to the Fock space of
multiple particles. To demonstrate our methods, we introduce multiplicative
topological phases of matter based on the foundational Hopf and Chern insulator
phases, the multiplicative Hopf and Chern insulators (MHI and MCI),
respectively. The MHI shows the distinctive properties of the parent phases as
well as non-trivial topology of a child phase. We also comment on a similar
structure in topological superconductors as these multiplicative phases are
protected in part by particle-hole symmetry. The MCI phase realizes
topologically-protected gapless states that do not extend from the valence
bands to the conduction bands for open boundary conditions, which respect the
symmetries protecting topological phase. The band connectivity discovered in
the MCI could serve as a blueprint for potential multiplicative topology with
exotic properties.

learning. It composes of representation learning and metrics calculation
designs. Previous works construct class representations in different ways,
varying from mean output embedding to covariance and distributions. However,
using embeddings in space lacks expressivity and cannot capture class
information robustly, while statistical complex modeling poses difficulty to
metric designs. In this work, we use tensor fields (``areas'') to model classes
from the geometrical perspective for few-shot learning. We present a simple and
effective method, dubbed hypersphere prototypes (HyperProto), where class
information is represented by hyperspheres with dynamic sizes with two sets of
learnable parameters: the hypersphere's center and the radius. Extending from
points to areas, hyperspheres are much more expressive than embeddings.
Moreover, it is more convenient to perform metric-based classification with
hypersphere prototypes than statistical modeling, as we only need to calculate
the distance from a data point to the surface of the hypersphere. Following
this idea, we also develop two variants of prototypes under other measurements.
Extensive experiments and analysis on few-shot learning tasks across NLP and CV
and comparison with 20+ competitive baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.

about 1 eV are found in these moderate-gap, inorganic bulk semiconductors,
pushing the limit of our understanding of electron-hole (e-h) interaction and
exciton formation in solids. Not only are the exciton binding energies
extremely large compared with any other moderate-gap bulk semiconductors, but
they are also larger than typical 2D semiconductors with comparable
quasiparticle gaps. Our calculated lowest bright exciton energy agrees well
with the experimental optical band gap. The low-energy excitons closely
resemble the Frenkel excitons in molecular crystals, as they are highly
localized in a single [MX6]2- octahedron and extended in the reciprocal space.
The weak dielectric screening effects and the nearly flat frontier electronic
bands, which are derived from the weakly bonded [MX6]2- units, together explain
the significant excitonic effects. Spin-orbit coupling effects play a crucial

of young stars. During the combined evolution, stellar and disk parameters
influence each other, motivating a combined stellar and disk model. This makes
a combined numerical model, evolving the disk alongside the star, the next
logical step in the progress of studying early stellar evolution. We aim to
understand the effects of metallicity on the accretion disk and the stellar
spin evolution during the T~Tauri phase. We combine the numerical treatment of
a hydrodynamic disk with stellar evolution, including a stellar spin model,
allowing a self-consistent calculation of the back-reactions between the
individual components. We present the self-consistent theoretical evolution of
T-Tauri stars coupled to a stellar disk. We find that disks in low metallicity
environments are heated differently and have shorter lifetimes, compared to
their solar metallicity counterparts. Differences in stellar radii, the
contraction rate of the stellar radius, and the shorter disk lifetimes result
in faster rotation of low metallicity stars. We present an additional
explanation for the observed short disk lifetimes in low metallicity clusters.
A combination of our model with previous studies (e.g., a metallicity-based
photo-evaporation) could help to understand disk evolution and dispersal at
different metallicities. Furthermore, the stellar spin evolution model includes
several important effects, previously ignored (e.g., the stellar magnetic field
strength and a realistic calculation of the disk lifetime) and we motivate to
include our results as initial or input parameters for further spin evolution

this, we quantify the spectral properties of the \iris~\mgii~ribbon front
profiles during four large flares and perform a detailed comparison with a grid

transition region counterparts, finding that these ribbon front locations are
regions where transition region emission and chromospheric evaporation are
considerably weaker compared to other parts of the ribbons. Based on our
comparison between the \iris~observations and modelling, our interpretation is
that there are different heating regimes at play in the leading and trailing
regions of the ribbons. More specifically, we suggest that bombardment of the
chromosphere by more gradual and modest non-thermal electron energy fluxes can
qualitatively explain the \iris~observations at the ribbon front, while
stronger and more impulsive energy fluxes are required to drive chromospheric

interest. Spatiotemporal clustering addresses the need to efficiently discover
patterns and trends in moving object behavior without human supervision. One
application of interest is the discovery of moving clusters, where clusters
have a static identity, but their location and content can change over time. We
propose a two phase spatiotemporal clustering method called spatiotemporal
k-means (STKM) that is able to analyze the multi-scale relationships within
spatiotemporal data. Phase 1 of STKM frames the moving cluster problem as the
minimization of an objective function unified over space and time. It outputs
the short-term associations between objects and is uniquely able to track
dynamic cluster centers with minimal parameter tuning and without
post-processing. Phase 2 outputs the long-term associations and can be applied
to any method that provides a cluster label for each object at every point in
time. We evaluate STKM against baseline methods on a recently developed
benchmark dataset and show that STKM outperforms existing methods, particularly
in the low-data domain, with significant performance improvements demonstrated
for common evaluation metrics on the moving cluster problem.

green datacenters, resource availability depends on the power supply from the
renewables. Intermittent power supply from renewables leads to intermittent
resource availability, inducing job delays (and associated costs). Green
datacenter operators must intelligently manage their workloads and available
power supply to extract maximum benefits. The scheduler's objective is to
schedule jobs on a set of resources to maximize the total value (revenue) while
minimizing the overall job delay. A trade-off exists between achieving high job
value on the one hand and low expected delays on the other. Hence, the aims of
achieving high rewards and low costs are in opposition. In addition, datacenter
operators often prioritize multiple objectives, including high system
utilization and job completion. To accomplish the opposing goals of maximizing
total job value and minimizing job delays, we apply the
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Lagrangian methods in Deep Reinforcement
Learning to job scheduling problem in the green datacenter environment.
Lagrangian methods are widely used algorithms for constrained optimization
problems. We adopt a controls perspective to learn the Lagrange multiplier with
proportional, integral, and derivative control, achieving favorable learning
dynamics. Feedback control defines cost terms for the learning agent, monitors
the cost limits during training, and continuously adjusts the learning
parameters to achieve stable performance. Our experiments demonstrate improved
performance compared to scheduling policies without the PID Lagrangian methods.
Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the Constraint Controlled
Reinforcement Learning (CoCoRL) scheduler that simultaneously satisfies
multiple objectives.

instances of diagonal AAH models using up to 41 qubits, we experimentally
demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum, predicted for a
two-dimensional (2D) electron gas under a perpendicular magnetic field. In
addition, we apply Floquet engineering to simulate gapless commensurate
off-diagonal AAH models, directly measure the band structures and witness the
localisation of a boundary excitation during its quantum walks (QWs). With the
bulk-edge correspondence, we verify the existence of topological zero-energy
edge modes in the gapless commensurate AAH models, which have never been
experimentally observed before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our
quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological
features of a 1D quantum many-body system from its complex band structure,
including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between the
even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states.
Using a superconducting quantum processor assisted by highly controllable

learning the new ones. With the specific focus on the class-incremental OCL
scenario, i.e. OCL for classification, the recent advance incorporates the
contrastive learning technique for learning more generalised feature
representation to achieve the state-of-the-art performance but is still unable
to fully resolve the catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we follow the
strategy of adopting contrastive learning but further introduce the
semantically distinct augmentation technique, in which it leverages strong
augmentation to generate more data samples, and we show that considering these
samples semantically different from their original classes (thus being related
to the out-of-distribution samples) in the contrastive learning mechanism
contributes to alleviate forgetting and facilitate model stability. Moreover,
in addition to contrastive learning, the typical classification mechanism and
objective (i.e. softmax classifier and cross-entropy loss) are included in our
model design for faster convergence and utilising the label information, but
particularly equipped with a sampling strategy to tackle the tendency of

chemical doping, structural deformation, or electric bias have been developed.
In the current work, we suggest that magnetic proximity effect via van der
Waals interfacial interaction, a contact-free strategy, also breaks the
centrosymmetry and generate large BPV photocurrents. Using the Bi2Te3 quintuple
layer as an exemplary material, we show that magnetic proximity from MnBi2Te4
septuple layers yield finite and tunable shift and injection photocurrents. We
apply group analysis and first-principles calculations to evaluate the
layer-specific shift and injection current generations under linearly polarized
light irradiation. We find that the magnetic injection photoconductivity that
localized on the Bi2Te3 layer can reach over 70*108 A/(V2s), so that a 1D
linear current density on the order of 0.1 mA/nm can be achieved under an
intermediate intensity light. In addition to charge current, we also extend our
discussions into spin BPV current, giving pure photo-generated spin current.
The vertical propagation direction between the charge and spin photocurrents
suggest that they can be used individually in a single material. Compared with
previously reported methods, the magnetic proximity effect via van der Waals
interface does not significantly alter the intrinsic feature of the
centrosymmetric material (e.g., Bi2Te3), and its manipulation can be easily
achieved by the proximate magnetic configurations (of MnBi2Te4), interlayer
distance, and light polarization.

the transition state from the sequence's history according to some distribution
which does not have to be bounded. The LAMP model captures complex
relationships and long-range dependencies in data with similar expressibility
to a higher-order Markov process. While a higher-order Markov process has a
polynomial parameter space, a LAMP model is characterised only by a probability
distribution and the transition matrix of an underlying first-order Markov
Chain. We prove that the theoretical entropy rate of a LAMP is equivalent to
the theoretical entropy rate of the underlying first-order Markov Chain. This
surprising result is explained by the randomness introduced by the random
process which selects the LAMP transitioning state, and provides a tool to
model complex dependencies in data while retaining useful theoretical results.
We use the LAMP model to estimate the entropy rate of the LastFM, BrightKite,
Wikispeedia and Reuters-21578 datasets. We compare estimates calculated using
frequency probability estimates, a first-order Markov model and the LAMP model,

Fortunately, in many of these situations, it is possible to adopt a surrogate

inference directly on the surrogate, but this can result in bias and poor
uncertainty quantification. In this paper we propose a new method for adjusting
approximate posterior samples to reduce bias and produce more accurate

critical exponents and curvature renormalization group (CRG) method to
understand the aspects of interplay. The longer-range (finite neighbors) effect
produces higher winding numbers, where we observe a staircase of transitions
among the even-even and odd-odd winding numbers which depends on the number of
interacting neighbors. Here we also highlight the effect of multi-criticality
in the system and show that they belong to a different universality class. The
interplay of long-range (infinite neighbors) effect and non-Hermiticity
produces fractional topological invariants, and we analyze them from the
behavior of pseudo-spin vectors. We also determine the long-range and
short-range limit of the model through universality class of critical
exponents. Our work mainly showcases that how the study of criticality in

magnetic field and shock normal direction ($\theta_{Bn}$) as it propagates
through the Parker spiral magnetic field from the lower corona to 1 AU. We find
that the high-energy SEP intensity varies significantly along the shock front
due to the evolution of $\theta_{Bn}$. Generally, the west flank of the shock
preferentially accelerates particles to high energies compared to the east
flank and shock nose. This can be understood in terms of the rate of
acceleration, which is higher at the west flank. Double power-law energy
spectra are reproduced in our model as a consequence of the local acceleration
and transport effects. These results will help better understand the evolution
of SEP acceleration and provide new insights into large SEP events observed by

Honeycomb heterostructure could be a promising route to realize and utilize
such an exotic quantum phase by providing additional controllability of
Hamiltonian and device compatibility, respectively. Here, we provide epitaxial
honeycomb oxide thin film Na3Co2SbO6, a candidate of Kitaev quantum spin liquid
proposed recently. We found a spin glass and antiferromagnetic ground states
depending on Na stoichiometry, signifying not only the importance of Na vacancy
control but also strong frustration in Na3Co2SbO6. Despite its classical ground
state, the field-dependent magnetic susceptibility shows remarkable scaling
collapse with a single critical exponent, which can be interpreted as evidence
of quantum criticality. Its electronic ground state and derived spin
Hamiltonian from spectroscopies are consistent with the predicted Kitaev model.
Our work provides a unique route to the realization and utilization of Kitaev
quantum spin liquid.

radiotherapy (SBRT) using the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) projections
acquired for pre-treatment patient set-up. Materials and Methods: Pre-treatment
CBCT projections and anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) pair of
fluoroscopic sequences of 7 pancreatic and 6 liver SBRT patients with implanted
fiducials were analyzed for 49 treatment fractions retrospectively. A tracking
algorithm based on template matching and sequential stereo triangulation
algorithms was used to track the fiducials in the CBCT projections and the
fluoro sequence pairs. We predicted the clinical couch adjustment from CBCT
tracking and compared it with the clinical couch decision made during the
patient's treatment. Results: In 3D coordinate, the fiducial motion ranges for
pancreas cases were 9.90+/-3.52 mm, 10.65+/-5.91 mm, and 10.74+/-6.24 mm for
CBCT, AP, and LAT fluoro, respectively, while in the liver, they were
13.93+/-3.39 mm, 11.17+/-3.75 mm, and 11.52+/-4.33 mm, respectively. Prediction
of couch adjustment in LAT, SI, and AP coordinates from CBCT tracking agrees
with the actual clinical couch correction within 0.92+/-0.74 mm, 1.37+/-1.26
mm, and 0.68+/-0.56 mm for pancreas cases and within 1.12+/-0.96 mm,
1.15+/-0.92 mm and 0.90+/-0.86 mm for liver cases, respectively. Conclusion:
Tracking pre-treatment CBCT projections using template matching and sequential
stereo triangulation is suitable for assessing fiducial motion and adjusting
the patient setup for abdominal SBRT. CBCT can be used for motion modeling,
potentially eliminating the need for additional fluoroscopic pair acquisition
and thus reducing the imaging dose to the patient and the total treatment time.

performance and the size of trainable data. This letter proposed a framework
for learning the visual representation of underwater acoustic imageries, which
takes a transformer-based style transfer model as the main body. It could
replace the low-level texture features of optical images with the visual
features of underwater acoustic imageries while preserving their raw high-level
semantic content. The proposed framework could fully use the rich optical image
dataset to generate a pseudo-acoustic image dataset and use it as the initial
sample to train the underwater acoustic target recognition model. The
experiments select the dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON) as the
underwater acoustic data source and also take fish, the most common marine
creature, as the research subject. Experimental results show that the proposed
method could generate high-quality and high-fidelity pseudo-acoustic samples,
achieve the purpose of acoustic data enhancement and provide support for the

charged-particle distributions which generate a wide range of electromagnetic
waves. These waves, in turn, can further accelerate and scatter energetic
particles. Thus, the properties of the waves and their implication for
wave-particle interactions are critically important for modeling energetic
particle dynamics in shock environments. Whistler-mode waves, excited by the
electron heat flux or a temperature anisotropy, arise naturally near shocks and
foreshock transients. As a result, they can often interact with supra-thermal
electrons. The low background magnetic field typical at the core of such
transients and the large wave amplitudes may cause such interactions to enter
the nonlinear regime. In this study, we present a statistical characterization
of whistler-mode waves at foreshock transients around Earth bow shock, as they
are observed under a wide range of upstream conditions. We find that a
significant portion of them are sufficiently intense and coherent to warrant
nonlinear treatment. Copious observations of background magnetic field
gradients and intense whistler wave amplitudes suggest that phase trapping, a
very effective mechanism for electron acceleration in inhomogeneous plasmas,
may be the cause. We discuss the implications of our findings for electron
acceleration in planetary and astrophysical shock environments.

state-of-the-art handwriting recognition methods. Moreover, as a low-resource

in Vietnamese, which makes handwriting recognition in this language have a
barrier for researchers to approach. Recent works evaluated offline handwriting
recognition methods in Vietnamese using images from an online handwriting

methods effectively, as it is trivial and may be lack of features that are

challenge, since neuron models are non-differentiable and traditional

Furthermore, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), albeit being a
spike-based learning rule, updates weights locally and does not optimize for
the output error of the network. We present desire backpropagation, a method to
derive the desired spike activity of neurons from the output error. The loss
function can then be evaluated locally for every neuron. Incorporating the
desire values into the STDP weight update leads to global error minimization
and increasing classification accuracy. At the same time, the neuron dynamics

based on superconducting qubits, quantum dots, and cold atoms -- can apply
two-qubit gates only on certain pairs of qubits. Other schemes -- such as those
based on trapped ions and photonics -- are not subject to such constraints.
These qubit connectivity constraints are commonly viewed as a disadvantage; for
example, compiling an unrestricted n-qubit quantum circuit to one with poor
qubit connectivity, such as a 1D chain, usually results in a blowup of depth by
$O(n^2)$ and size by $O(n)$. It is appealing to conjecture that this overhead
is unavoidable -- a random circuit on n qubits has $\Theta(n)$ 2-qubit gates in
each layer and a constant fraction of them act on qubits separated by distance
$\Theta(n)$.
  While it is known that almost all n-qubit unitaries need quantum circuits of
$\Omega(4^n/n)$ depth and $\Omega(4^n)$ size to realize, in this paper, we show
that all $n$-qubit unitaries can be implemented by circuits of $O(4^n/n)$ depth
and $O(4^n)$ size even under 1D chain qubit connectivity constraints.
  We extend this result and investigate qubit connectivity along three
directions. First, we consider more general connectivity graphs, and show that
the size can always be made $O(4^n)$ as long as the graph is connected. For
depth, we study d-dimensional grids, complete d-ary trees and expander graphs,
and show results similar to the 1D chain. Second, we consider the case when
ancillae are available. We show that, with ancillae, the depth can be made
polynomial, and the space-depth trade-off is not impaired by the qubit
connectivity constraint unless we have exponentially many ancillae. Third, we
consider special unitaries, including diagonal unitaries and quantum state
preparation, the last being a fundamental task used in many quantum algorithms
for machine learning and linear algebra problems.

been made to debias PLMs by prompt tuning with continuous prompts compared to
its discrete counterpart. Furthermore, for most debiasing methods that alter a
PLM's original parameters, a major problem is the need to not only decrease the
bias in the PLM but also to ensure that the PLM does not lose its
representation ability. Finetuning methods typically have a hard time
maintaining this balance, as they tend to violently remove meanings of
attribute words. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, a method to debias PLMs using
prompt tuning while maintaining the delicate balance between removing biases
and ensuring representation ability. To achieve this, we propose a new training
criterion inspired by manifold learning and equip it with an explicit debiasing
term to optimize prompt tuning. In addition, we conduct several experiments
with regard to the reliability, quality, and quantity of a previously proposed
attribute training corpus in order to obtain a clearer prototype of a certain
attribute, which indicates the attribute's position and relative distances to
other words on the manifold. We evaluate ADEPT on several widely acknowledged
debiasing benchmarks and downstream tasks, and find that it achieves
competitive results while maintaining (and in some cases even improving) the
PLM's representation ability. We further visualize words' correlation before
and after debiasing a PLM, and give some possible explanations for the visible
effects.

of time series in many fields, ranging from physics and finance to medicine and
biology. Real-world systems may be in general non stationary, with an entropy
value that is not constant in time. The goal of this paper is to propose a
hypothesis testing procedure to test the null hypothesis of constant Shannon
entropy for time series, against the alternative of a significant variation of
the entropy between two subsequent periods. To this end, we find an unbiased
approximation of the variance of the Shannon entropy's estimator, up to the
order O(n^(-4)) with n the sample size. In order to characterize the variance
of the estimator, we first obtain the explicit formulas of the central moments
for both the binomial and the multinomial distributions, which describe the
distribution of the Shannon entropy. Second, we find the optimal length of the
rolling window used for estimating the time-varying Shannon entropy by
optimizing a novel self-consistent criterion based on the counting of
significant variations of entropy within a time window. We corroborate our
findings by using the novel methodology to test for time-varying regimes of
entropy for stock price dynamics, in particular considering the case of meme
stocks in 2020 and 2021. We empirically show the existence of periods of market
inefficiency for meme stocks. In particular, sharp increases of prices and
trading volumes correspond to statistically significant drops of Shannon
entropy.

the field of pattern recognition. It is challenging because it maximizes the
classification performance and, at the same time, minimizes the number of
selected features, and the mentioned two objectives are usually conflicting. To
achieve a better Pareto optimal solution, metaheuristic optimization methods
are widely used in many studies. However, the main drawback is the exploration
of a large search space. Another problem with multi-objective feature selection
approaches is the interaction between features. Selecting correlated features
has negative effect on classification performance. To tackle these problems, we
present a novel multi-objective feature selection method that has several
advantages. Firstly, it considers the interaction between features using an
advanced probability scheme. Secondly, it is based on the Pareto Archived
Evolution Strategy (PAES) method that has several advantages such as simplicity
and its speed in exploring the solution space. However, we improve the
structure of PAES in such a way that generates the offsprings, intelligently.
Thus, the proposed method utilizes the introduced probability scheme to produce
more promising offsprings. Finally, it is equipped with a novel strategy that
guides it to find the optimum number of features through the process of

most of their life as hot stars. Due to their high effective temperatures, the
maximum of their emitted flux falls into the ultraviolet (UV) regime.
Consequently, these stars emit a significant number of photons with energies
sufficiently high enough to ionize hydrogen and other elements. As simple as
these fundamental considerations are, as complex is a realistic estimate of the
resulting ionizing fluxes, in particular for energies above 54 eV. Estimating
the ionizing flux budget of hot stars requires accurate models of their

exceptional properties of multicomponent alloys. However, direct validation and
confirmation of CSRO has been highly elusive in most compounds. Recent studies
for equiatomic NiCoCr alloys have shown that thermal treatments (i.e.,
annealing/aging) may facilitate and manipulate CSRO. In this work, by using
molecular simulations, we show that nanomechanical probes, such as
nanoindentation, may be utilized towards further manipulation of CSRO,
providing explicit validation pathways. By using well established interatomic
potentials, we perform hybrid Molecular-Dynamics/Monte-Carlo (MD/MC) at room
temperature to demonstrate that particular dwell nanoindentation protocols can
lead, through thermal MC equilibration, to the reorganization of CSRO under the
indenter tip, to a density-wave stripe pattern (DWO). We characterize the novel
DWO structures, that are directly correlated to incipient SRO but are highly
anisotropic and dependent on local, nanoindentation-induced stress
concentrations, and we show how they deeply originate from the peculiarities of
the interatomic potentials. Furthermore, we show that the DWO patterns
consistently scale up with the incipient plastic zone under the indenter tip,
justifying the observation of the DWO patterning at any experimentally feasible
nanoindentation depth.

in the description of energy diffusion that emerges in quantum systems from
time-keeping errors in a real clock used to track time evolution. We show that
the latter can be related to an inverse $T\bar{T}$ deformation with a purely
imaginary deformation parameter. In this case, the integral transforms take a
particularly simple form when the initial state is a coherent Gibbs state or a
thermofield double state, as we illustrate by characterizing the purity,
R\'enyi entropies, logarithmic negativity, and the spectral form factor. As the
dissipative evolution of a quantum system can be conveniently described in
Liouville space, we further discuss the spectral properties of the

that integrates semantic learning and emulation. With the help of the labeled
semantic flow graph, BinSeeker can quickly identify M candidate functions that
are most similar to the vulnerability from the target binary. The value of M is
relatively large so this semantic learning procedure essentially eliminates
those functions that are very unlikely to have the vulnerability. Then,
semantic emulation is conducted on these M candidates to obtain their dynamic
signature sequences. By comparing signature sequences, BinSeeker produces top-N
functions that exhibit most similar behavior to that of the vulnerability. With
fast filtering of semantic learning and accurate comparison of semantic
emulation, BinSeeker seeks vulnerability precisely with little overhead. The
experiments on six widely used programs with fifteen known CVE vulnerabilities
demonstrate that BinSeeker outperforms three state-of-the-art tools Genius,
Gemini and CACompare. Regarding search accuracy, BinSeeker achieves an MRR

viscosity is large as compared with the shear viscosity, two types of

closed orbits in dynamical systems, and its circular trajectories are
determined by the ratio between the magnitude of the odd viscosity and the

limitations. For ANN-to-SNN conversion, it requires a long inference time to
approximate the accuracy of ANN, thus diminishing the benefits of SNN. With
spike-based BP, training high-precision SNNs typically consumes dozens of times
more computational resources and time than their ANN counterparts. In this

and reliable prediction models enabling more efficient trajectory planning

the evaluation of such models is commonly oversimplistic, ignoring the

  Problems",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning classifiers using skewed or imbalanced datasets can occasionally
lead to classification issues; this is a serious issue. In some cases, one
class contains the majority of examples while the other, which is frequently
the more important class, is nevertheless represented by a smaller proportion
of examples. Using this kind of data could make many carefully designed
machine-learning systems ineffective. High training fidelity was a term used to
describe biases vs. all other instances of the class. The best approach to all
possible remedies to this issue is typically to gain from the minority class.
The article examines the most widely used methods for addressing the problem of
learning with a class imbalance, including data-level, algorithm-level, hybrid,
cost-sensitive learning, and deep learning, etc. including their advantages and
limitations. The efficiency and performance of the classifier are assessed

terms in review texts and determining their sentiment polarities, which is
widely studied in both academia and industry. As a fine-grained classification
task, the annotation cost is extremely high. Domain adaptation is a popular
solution to alleviate the data deficiency issue in new domains by transferring
common knowledge across domains. Most cross-domain ABSA studies are based on
structure correspondence learning (SCL), and use pivot features to construct
auxiliary tasks for narrowing down the gap between domains. However, their
pivot-based auxiliary tasks can only transfer knowledge of aspect terms but not
sentiment, limiting the performance of existing models. In this work, we
propose a novel Syntax-guided Domain Adaptation Model, named SDAM, for more
effective cross-domain ABSA. SDAM exploits syntactic structure similarities for
building pseudo training instances, during which aspect terms of target domain
are explicitly related to sentiment polarities. Besides, we propose a
syntax-based BERT mask language model for further capturing domain-invariant
features. Finally, to alleviate the sentiment inconsistency issue in multi-gram
aspect terms, we introduce a span-based joint aspect term and sentiment
analysis module into the cross-domain End2End ABSA. Experiments on five
benchmark datasets show that our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines with respect to Micro-F1 metric for the cross-domain
End2End ABSA task.

non-linear effects such as erosion and fouling. As a result, the multiscale

dispersed phase, especially in the presence of transition and separation. In
this work, we present the extension of the open-source high-order accurate CFD
framework FLEXI towards particle-laden flows. FLEXI is a massively parallel
solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations which operates on
(un-)structured grids including curved elements and hanging nodes. An efficient

Spectrograph (IRIS) provides unique diagnostics to investigate the
thermodynamics of flares in the solar atmosphere. The Mg II h&k and Mg II UV
triple lines provide key information about the thermodynamics of low to upper

peculiar, pointy shape before and during the flare activity. The physical
interpretation that can explain these profiles has remained elusive. In this
paper, we show the results of a non-LTE inversion of such peculiar profiles. To
better constrain the atmospheric conditions, the Mg II h&k and Mg II UV triple
lines are simultaneously inverted with the C II 1334 & 1335 AA lines. This
combined inversion leads to more accurate derived thermodynamic parameters,
especially the temperature and the turbulent motions (micro-turbulence
velocity). We use the inversion code STiC to look for the best fit between the
observed profile and a synthetic profile obtained by solving the radiative
transfer problem considering non-local thermodynamic equilibrium and partial
frequency redistribution of the radiation due to scattered photons. We are able
to conclude that these unique, pointy profiles are associated with a
simultaneous increase of the temperature and the electron density in the
chromosphere, while the micro-turbulence velocity has values between 5-15 km/s,
which seem to be more realistic values than the ones suggested in previous
work. More importantly, the line-of-sight velocity shows a large gradient along
the optical depth in the high chromosphere. This seems to be the parameter that
gives the pointy aspect to these profiles.

understanding of physical processes and technological applications. In this
work, we present a method for low-temperature measurement that improves thermal
range and sensitivity by generating quantum coherence in a thermometer probe.
Typically, in temperature measurements, the probes thermalize with the sample
being measured. However, we use a two-level quantum system, or qubit, as our
probe and prevent direct probe access to the sample by introducing a set of
ancilla qubits as an interface. We describe the open system dynamics of the
probe using a global master equation and demonstrate that while the
ancilla-probe system thermalizes with the sample, the probe per se evolves into
a non-thermal steady state due to nonlocal dissipation channels. The
populations and coherences of this steady state depend on the sample
temperature, allowing for precise and wide-range low temperature estimation. We
characterize the thermometric performance of the method using quantum Fisher
information and show that the quantum Fisher information can exhibit multiple

coherence and the number of ancilla qubits. Our analysis reveals that the

not form in the non-magnetic structure, and the Li diffusion barrier without

advocates the hole polaron migration scenario for Li-ion diffusion. Moreover,
we demonstrate that the strong electron correlation of Co ions plays an
essential role in stabilizing the Co4+ polaron.

infectious diseases. During an outbreak, monitoring the infection situation on
either side of an international border is very crucial as there is always a
higher risk of disease importation associated with cross-border migration.
Mechanistic models are effective tools to investigate the consequences of
cross-border mobility on disease dynamics and help in designing effective
control strategies. However, in practice, due to the unavailability of
cross-border mobility data, it becomes difficult to propose reliable,
model-based strategies. In this study, we propose a method for estimating
cross-border mobility flux between any pair of regions that share an
international border from the observed difference in the timing of the
infection peak in each region. Assuming the underlying disease dynamics is
governed by a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, we employ stochastic
simulations to obtain the maximum likelihood cross-border mobility estimate for
any pair of regions where the difference in peak time can be measured. We then
investigate how the estimate of cross-border mobility flux varies depending on
the disease transmission rate, which is a key epidemiological parameter. We
further show that the uncertainty in mobility flux estimates decreases for
higher disease transmission rates and larger observed differences in peak
timing. Finally, as a case study, we apply the method to some selected regions
along the Poland-Germany border which are directly connected through multiple
modes of transportation and quantify the cross-border fluxes from the COVID-19

the external coupling of single zinc oxide nanowires to an aluminum grating,
which enabled a quasi-single mode lasing action. The nano-manipulation of a
single nanowire allowed for a reliable comparison of the lasing emission
characteristics in both planar (i.e. nanowire on the metallic substrate) and

single-phase solid solution state is typically not achieved for thin films
grown at higher temperatures. The same holds true for Cantor alloy-based
ceramics (nitrides and oxides), where phase formation is extremely sensitive to
process parameters such as the amount of reactive gas. This study combines
theoretical and experimental methods to understand the phase formation in
nitrogen-containing CrFeCoNi thin films. Density functional theory calculations
considering three competing phases (CrN, Fe-Ni and Co) show that the free
energy of mixing, delta G of (CrFeCoNi)1-xNx solid solutions has a maximum at x

intermediate amounts of nitrogen (x = 0.22) grown at higher temperatures show
segregation into multiple phases of CrN, Fe-Ni-rich and Co. These results offer
an explanation for the requirement of kinetically limited growth conditions at

cope with errors in the aforementioned estimation of the cardinality of the set

of $n$ clients and $m$ facilities in a metric space. A feasible solution
consists of an assignment of each client to some facility. For each client, one
has to pay the distance to the associated facility. Furthermore, for each
facility $f$ to which we assign the subset of clients $S^f$, one has to pay the
opening cost $g(S^f)$, where $g(\cdot)$ is a monotone submodular function with
$g(\emptyset)=0$.
  SFL is APX-hard since it includes the classical (metric uncapacitated)
Facility Location problem (with uniform facility costs) as a special case.
Svitkina and Tardos [SODA'06] gave the current-best $O(\log n)$ approximation
algorithm for SFL. The same authors pose the open problem whether SFL admits a
constant approximation and provide such an approximation for a very restricted
special case of the problem.
  We make some progress towards the solution of the above open problem by
presenting an $O(\log\log n)$ approximation. Our approach is rather flexible
and can be easily extended to generalizations and variants of SFL. In more
detail, we achieve the same approximation factor for the practically relevant
generalizations of SFL where the opening cost of each facility $f$ is of the
form $p_f+g(S^f)$ or $w_f\cdot g(S^f)$, where $p_f,w_f \geq 0$ are input
values.
  We also obtain an improved approximation algorithm for the related Universal
Stochastic Facility Location problem. In this problem one is given a classical
(metric) facility location instance and has to a priori assign each client to
some facility. Then a subset of active clients is sampled from some given
distribution, and one has to pay (a posteriori) only the connection and opening
costs induced by the active clients. The expected opening cost of each facility
$f$ can be modelled with a submodular function of the set of clients assigned
to $f$.

sectors, we can establish analytically the universality of a feature of the
bottom-up thermalization scenario, namely that the energy density of the more
weakly coupled (perturbative) sector at sufficiently early times dominates over
that of the strongly coupled (holographic) one with an exponent determined by
the respective viscosities and relaxation times. On the attractor surface, the
hydrodynamization times of both subsectors decrease following a conformal
scaling behavior with the total energy densities at the respective
hydrodynamization (times a pre-factor), reach their minimum values and
subsequently increase rapidly. The minimum values are obtained when the
respective energy densities are of the order of the inverse of the dimensionful
inter-system coupling. The pre-factor in the conformal window is universal and
identical to that in usual conformal attractors for the dominant sector, while
that of the other sector increases with the ratio of the dominant to
subdominant sector's energy-densities at sufficiently early time. Studying
initial conditions motivated by saturation scenarios in $p$-$p$ and Pb-Pb

the holographic sector hydrodynamizes earlier in $p$-$p$ collisions, since the
total energy densities at the hydrodynamization times fall inside and outside

Further, the proposed composite event-trigger mechanism is combined with a
prescribed performance control scheme, constructing a complete controller

linearly with $T$ from the onset of superconductivity to the crystal melting
temperature, indicative of a Planckian dissipation life time
$\tau_{\hbar}\simeq\hbar/(k_B T)$. At the same time, the optical conductivity
ceases to be of the Drude form at high temperatures, suggesting a change in
dynamics that surprisingly leaves the $T$-linear DC-resistivity unaffected. We
use the AdS/CFT correspondence that describes strongly coupled, densely
entangled states of matter to study the DC and optical conductivities of the
local quantum critical Gubser-Rocha holographic strange metal in 2+1D in the
presence of a lattice potential, a prime candidate to compare with experiment.
We find that the DC-resistivity is linear in $T$ at low temperatures for a
range of potential strengths and wavevectors, even as it transitions between
different dissipative regimes. At weak lattice potential the optical
conductivity evolves with temperature from a Drude form to a bad metal
characterized by a mid-IR resonance without changing the DC transport, similar
to that seen in cuprate strange metals. This mid-IR peak can be understood as a
consequence of Umklapp hydrodynamics: i.e. hydrodynamic perturbations are Bloch
modes in the presence of a lattice. At strong lattice potential an incoherent
metal is realized where momentum conservation no longer plays a role in
transport. In this regime the thermal diffusivity appears insensitive to the
breaking of translations and can be explained by Planckian dissipation
originating in universal microscopic chaos. The charge diffusivity cannot be
explained this way, though the continuing linear-in-T DC resistivity saturates
to an apparent universal slope, numerically equal to a Planckian rate. We
conjecture that this may originate in chaos properties that differ between
charged and neutral operators.

that at the dense core of the blob there is a very strong coupling and the
charged and neutral components of the plasma behave as a single fluid, with
negligible drift velocities (of a few cm s^-1). On the other hand, at the edges
of the blob the coupling is much weaker and larger drift velocities (of the
order of 1 km s^-1) appear. In addition, frictional heating causes large
increases of temperature at the transition layers between the blob and the
corona. For the first time we show that such large drift velocities and
temperature enhancements can develop as a consequence of ion-neutral decoupling
associated to coronal rain dynamics. This can lead to enhanced emission coming
from the plasma at the coronal rain-corona boundary, which possesses transition
region temperature.

ARTEO algorithm, where we cast multi-armed bandits as a mathematical
programming problem subject to safety constraints and learn the unknown
characteristics through exploration while optimizing the targets. We quantify
the uncertainty in unknown characteristics by using Gaussian processes and
incorporate it into the cost function as a contribution which drives
exploration. We adaptively control the size of this contribution in accordance
with the requirements of the environment. We guarantee the safety of our
algorithm with a high probability through confidence bounds constructed under
the regularity assumptions of Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the safety and

motor current and real-time bidding problems. We further evaluate the
performance of ARTEO compared to a safe variant of upper confidence bound based

to implement fast and ultra-low-power computing capabilities. One of the
drawbacks of analog implementation is component mismatches which cause
desynchronization and instability in ONNs. Emerging devices like memristors and
VO2 are particularly prone to variations. In this paper, we study the effect of
component mismatches on the performance of differential ONNs (DONNs).
Mismatches were considered in two main blocks: differential oscillatory neurons
and synaptic circuits. To measure DONN tolerance to mismatches in each block,
performance was evaluated with mismatches being present separately in each
block. Memristor-bridge circuits with four memristors were used as the synaptic
circuits. The differential oscillatory neurons were based on VO2-devices. The
simulation results showed that DONN performance was more vulnerable to
mismatches in the components of the differential oscillatory neurons than to
mismatches in the synaptic circuits. DONNs were found to tolerate up to 20%
mismatches in the memristance of the synaptic circuits. However, mismatches in
the differential oscillatory neurons resulted in non-uniformity of the natural
frequencies, causing desynchronization and instability. Simulations showed that
0.5% relative standard deviation (RSD) in natural frequencies can reduce DONN
performance dramatically. In addition, sensitivity analyses showed that the
high threshold voltage of VO2-devices is the most sensitive parameter for
frequency non-uniformity and desynchronization.

dialogue states which consist of slot-value pairs. As condensed structural
information memorizing all history information, the dialogue state in the last
turn is typically adopted as the input for predicting the current state by DST
models. However, these models tend to keep the predicted slot values unchanged,
which is defined as state momentum in this paper. Specifically, the models
struggle to update slot values that need to be changed and correct wrongly
predicted slot values in the last turn. To this end, we propose MoNET to tackle
state momentum via noise-enhanced training. First, the previous state of each
turn in the training data is noised via replacing some of its slot values.
Then, the noised previous state is used as the input to learn to predict the
current state, improving the model's ability to update and correct slot values.
Furthermore, a contrastive context matching framework is designed to narrow the
representation distance between a state and its corresponding noised variant,
which reduces the impact of noised state and makes the model better understand
the dialogue history. Experimental results on MultiWOZ datasets show that MoNET
outperforms previous DST methods. Ablations and analysis verify the
effectiveness of MoNET in alleviating state momentum and improving anti-noise
ability.

can be substantially different from that observed in the metal-rich Milky Way.
This changeover occurs because metal-poor gas clouds cool inefficiently due to
their lower abundance of metals and dust. However, predictions for the
metal-poor IMF to date rely on assuming Solar-scaled abundances, that is, [X/O]
= 0 at all [O/H]. There is now growing evidence that elements such as C and O
that dominate metal line cooling in the ISM do not follow Solar scaling at low
metallicities. In this work, we extend models that predict the variation in the
characteristic (or, the peak) IMF mass as a function of metallicity using [C/O]
ratios derived from observations of metal-poor Galactic stars and of H II
regions in dwarf galaxies. These data show [C/O] < 0 at sub-Solar [O/H], which
leads to a substantially different metal-poor IMF in the metallicity range
where C I and C II cooling dominate ISM thermodynamics, resulting in an
increase in the characteristic mass by a factor as large as 7. An important
consequence of this difference is a shift in the location of the transition
from a top- to a bottom-heavy IMF upwards by 0.5 $-$ 1 dex in metallicity. Our
findings indicate that the IMF is very sensitive to the assumptions around
Solar-scaled ISM compositions in metal-poor systems (e.g., dwarf galaxies, the
Galactic halo and metal-poor stars) that are a key focus of JWST.

(super-)flares on M/K-dwarfs and evolved stars sometimes show blue-shifted

on cool stars. More recently, evidence of stellar filament eruption, probably
leading to a CME, is reported even on a young solar-type star (G-dwarf) as a
blue-shifted absorption of H$\alpha$ line associated with a superflare.
Notably, the erupted masses for superflares are larger than those of the
largest solar CMEs, indicating severe influence on exoplanet environments. The
ratio of the kinetic energy of stellar CMEs to flare energy is significantly
smaller than expected from the solar scaling relation and this discrepancy is
still in debate. We will review the recent updates of stellar CME studies and

transmission over input-constrained memoryless channels. Our focus is on the
$(d,\infty)$-runlength limited (RLL) constraint, which mandates that any pair
of successive $1$s be separated by at least $d$ $0$s. In our study, we first
consider $(d,\infty)$-RLL subcodes of RM codes, taking the coordinates of the
RM codes to be in the standard lexicographic ordering. We show, via a simple
construction, that RM codes of rate $R$ have linear $(d,\infty)$-RLL subcodes
of rate $R\cdot{2^{-\left \lceil \log_2(d+1)\right \rceil}}$. We then show that
our construction is essentially rate-optimal, by deriving an upper bound on the
rates of linear $(d,\infty)$-RLL subcodes of RM codes of rate $R$. Next, for
the special case when $d=1$, we prove the existence of potentially non-linear
$(1,\infty)$-RLL subcodes that achieve a rate of
$\max\left(0,R-\frac38\right)$. This, for $R > 3/4$, beats the $R/2$ rate

$(1,\infty)$-RLL subcodes, not necessarily linear, of a certain canonical
sequence of RM codes of rate $R$. We then shift our attention to settings where
the coordinates of the RM code are not ordered according to the lexicographic

these cases as well. Finally, we present a new two-stage constrained coding
scheme, again using RM codes of rate $R$, which outperforms any linear coding
scheme using $(d,\infty)$-RLL subcodes, for values of $R$ close to $1$.

Rev. Lett. 129, 191101 (2022)], the black holes
were viewed as topological thermodynamic defects by using the generalized
off-shell free energy. In this paper, we follow such proposal to study the
local and global topological natures of the Gauss-Bonnet black holes in AdS
space. The local topological natures are reflected by the winding numbers,
where the positive and negative winding numbers correspond to the stable and
unstable black hole branches. The global topological natures are reflected by
the topological numbers, which are defined as the sum of the winding numbers
for all black hole branches and can be used to classify the black holes into
different classes. When the charge is present, we find that the topological
number is independent on the values of the parameters, and the charged
Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be divided into the same class of the RNAdS
black holes with the same topological number 1. However, when the charge is
absent, we find that the topological number has certain dimensional dependence.
This is different from the previous studies, where the topological number is
found to be a universal number independent of the black hole parameters.
Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviors of curve {\tau}(r_h) in small and large
radii limit can be a simple criterion to distinguish the different topological
number. We find a new asymptotic behavior as {\tau}(r_h \to 0) = 0 and
{\tau}(r_h \to \infty) = 0 in the black hole system, which shows topological
equivalency with the asymptotic behaviors {\tau}(r_h \to 0)=\infty and
{\tau}(r_h \to \infty)=\infty. We also give an intuitional proof of why there
are only three topological classes in the black hole system under the condition

made up of 10 - 100 million learnable weights and are therefore inherently
prone to overfitting. The complexity of the weight count can be seen as a
function of the number of channels, the spatial extent of the input and the
number of layers of the network. Due to the use of convolutional layers the
scaling of weight complexity is usually linear with regards to the resolution
dimensions, but remains quadratic with respect to the number of channels.
Active research in recent years in terms of using multigrid inspired ideas in
deep neural networks have shown that on one hand a significant number of
weights can be saved by appropriate weight sharing and on the other that a
hierarchical structure in the channel dimension can improve the weight
complexity to linear. In this work, we combine these multigrid ideas to
introduce a joint framework of multigrid inspired architectures, that exploit
multigrid structures in all relevant dimensions to achieve linear weight
complexity scaling and drastically reduced weight counts. Our experiments show
that this structured reduction in weight count is able to reduce overfitting
and thus shows improved performance over state-of-the-art ResNet architectures

scarce. We consider both cases where data collected from the source system is
noiseless and noisy. For each case, by leveraging the data collected from the

refers here to the benefit of initiating with a maximally entangled state
instead of a product one. This quantum advantage was known to vanish in the
same noisy scenario for a frequency estimation protocol. Restoration of the
better precision in frequency estimation with maximally entangled probes can be
attained via an Ising interaction between system particles or a magnetic field
applied in the transverse direction or both. A quantum advantage can also be
obtained while estimating the strength of the introduced magnetic field along
the transverse direction, whereas for the instances considered, no quantum
advantage is achieved in measuring the coupling parameter of the Ising
interaction. We also investigate the dependence of measurement precision on the
entanglement content, which is not necessarily maximal, of the initial states.
The precision in estimation of frequency and of transverse field strength
increases monotonically with the increase of entanglement content of the
initial state, while the same of coupling parameter of the Ising interaction,
shows a non-monotonic behavior.

flows in the interior of stars and accretion disks. The flow dynamics in these
objects is influenced by magnetic fields. For example, quasi-Keplerian flows in
Taylor-Couette geometry become unstable to a travelling or standing wave in an
external magnetic field if the fluid is conducting; there is an instability
even when the flow is hydrodynamically stable. This magnetorotational
instability leads to the development of chaotic states and, eventually,
turbulence, when the cylinder rotation is sufficiently fast. The transition to
turbulence in this flow can be complex, with the coexistence of parameter
regions with spatio-temporal chaos and regions with quasi-periodic behaviour,
involving one or two additional modulating frequencies. Although the unstable
modes of a periodic flow can be identified with Floquet analysis, here we adopt
a more flexible equation-free data-driven approach. We analyse the data from
the transition to chaos in the magnetized Taylor-Couette flow and identify the
flow structures related to the modulating frequencies with Dynamic Mode
Decomposition; this method is based on approximating nonlinear dynamics with a
linear infinite-dimensional Koopman operator. With the use of these structures,
one can construct a nonlinear reduced model for the transition.

storage is becoming practically feasible, as demonstrated by a number of
experimental storage systems, making it a promising solution for our society's
increasing need of data storage. While in living things, DNA molecules can
consist of millions of nucleotides, due to technological constraints, in
practice, data is stored on many short DNA molecules, which are preserved in a
DNA pool and cannot be spatially ordered. Moreover, imperfections in
sequencing, synthesis, and handling, as well as DNA decay during storage,
introduce random noise into the system, making the task of reliably storing and
retrieving information in DNA challenging. This unique setup raises a natural
information-theoretic question: how much information can be reliably stored on
and reconstructed from millions of short noisy sequences? The goal of this
monograph is to address this question by discussing the fundamental limits of
storing information on DNA. Motivated by current technological constraints on
DNA synthesis and sequencing, we propose a probabilistic channel model that
captures three key distinctive aspects of the DNA storage systems: (1) the data
is written onto many short DNA molecules that are stored in an unordered
fashion; (2) the molecules are corrupted by noise and (3) the data is read by
randomly sampling from the DNA pool. Our goal is to investigate the impact of
each of these key aspects on the capacity of the DNA storage system. Rather
than focusing on coding-theoretic considerations and computationally efficient
encoding and decoding, we aim to build an information-theoretic foundation for
the analysis of these channels, developing tools for achievability and converse
arguments.

the server-side aggregation process with a small amount of proxy data collected
by the service provider itself via a subspace training technique. Specifically,
the aggregation weight of each participating client at each round is optimized
using the server-collected proxy data, which is essentially the optimization of
the global model in the convex hull spanned by client models. Since at each
round, the number of tunable parameters optimized on the server side equals the
number of participating clients (thus independent of the model size), we are
able to train a global model with massive parameters using only a small amount
of proxy data (e.g., around one hundred samples). With optimized aggregation,
SmartFL ensures robustness against both heterogeneous and malicious clients,
which is desirable in real-world FL where either or both problems may occur. We
provide theoretical analyses of the convergence and generalization capacity for
SmartFL. Empirically, SmartFL achieves state-of-the-art performance on both FL

difficulties in their daily lives. The usage of assistive devices can help in
mitigating these issues and enable the patients to communicate effectively.
However, due to lack of large scale studies of linguistic deficits in aphasia,
research on such assistive technology is relatively limited. In this work, we
present two contributions that aim to re-initiate research and development in
this field. Firstly, we propose a model that uses linguistic features from
small scale studies on aphasia patients and generates large scale datasets of
synthetic aphasic utterances from grammatically correct datasets. We show that
the mean length of utterance, the noun/verb ratio, and the simple/complex
sentence ratio of our synthetic datasets correspond to the reported features of
aphasic speech. Further, we demonstrate how the synthetic datasets may be
utilized to develop assistive devices for aphasia patients. The pre-trained T5
transformer is fine-tuned using the generated dataset to suggest 5 corrected
sentences given an aphasic utterance as input. We evaluate the efficacy of the
T5 model using the BLEU and cosine semantic similarity scores. Affirming
results with BLEU score of 0.827/1.00 and semantic similarity of 0.904/1.00
were obtained. These results provide a strong foundation for the concept that a

  decomposition method",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [4, 10] are an approach for solving
boundary value problems based on differential equations (PDEs). The key idea of
PINNs is to use a neural network to approximate the solution to the PDE and to
incorporate the residual of the PDE as well as boundary conditions into its
loss function when training it. This provides a simple and mesh-free approach
for solving problems relating to PDEs. However, a key limitation of PINNs is
their lack of accuracy and efficiency when solving problems with larger domains
and more complex, multi-scale solutions. In a more recent approach, finite
basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) [8] use ideas from domain
decomposition to accelerate the learning process of PINNs and improve their
accuracy. In this work, we show how Schwarz-like additive, multiplicative, and
hybrid iteration methods for training FBPINNs can be developed. We present
numerical experiments on the influence of these different training strategies
on convergence and accuracy. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a preliminary
implementation of coarse space correction for FBPINNs.

time-invariant (LTI) system with bounded noise in the presence of sparse
attacks on an unknown, time-varying set of sensors. In other words, at each
time, the attacker has the freedom to choose an arbitrary set of no more that
$p$ sensors and manipulate their measurements without restraint. To this end,
we propose a secure state estimation scheme and guarantee a bounded estimation
error subject to $2p$-sparse observability and a mild, technical assumption
that the system matrix has no degenerate eigenvalues. The proposed scheme
comprises a design of decentralized observer for each sensor based on the local
observable subspace decomposition. At each time step, the local estimates of
sensors are fused by solving an optimization problem to obtain a secure
estimation, which is then followed by a local detection-and-resetting process
of the decentralized observers. The estimation error is shown to be
upper-bounded by a constant which is determined only by the system parameters
and noise magnitudes. Moreover, we optimize the detector threshold to ensure
that the benign sensors do not trigger the detector. The efficacy of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated by its application on a benchmark example of

We validate the proposed losses on standard vision datasets including CIFAR10,

from clumps with reliable heliocentric distance assignment. This value is in
general agreement with estimates found in the literature of last decades. The
profile of SFR density averaged in Galactocentric rings is found to be
qualitatively similar to others previously computed, with a peak corresponding
to the Central Molecular Zone and another one around Galactocentric radius
$R_\mathrm{gal} \sim 5$~kpc, followed by an exponential decrease as
$\log(\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}/[\mathrm{M}_\odot~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}~\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}])=a\,R_\mathrm{gal}/[\mathrm{kpc}]+b

corresponding to the far outer Galaxy ($R_\mathrm{gal} > 13.5$~kpc) is only
1\%. We also find that, for $R_\mathrm{gal}>3$~kpc, our data follow a power law
as a function of density, similarly to the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Finally,
we compare the distribution of the SFR density across the face-on Galactic
plane and those of median parameters, such as temperature, luminosity/mass
ratio and bolometric temperature, describing the evolutionary stage of Hi-GAL
clumps. We found no clear correlation between the SFR and the clump
evolutionary stage.

atmosphere is closely related to the plasma temperature and the height of
formation of the radiation is wavelength dependent. From that follows that the
slope of the brightness temperature (T$_\mathrm{b}$) continuum, samples the
local gradient of the gas temperature of the sampled layers in the solar
atmosphere. We use solar observations from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) and perform estimations and prediction
of the slope of the T$_\mathrm{b}$ continuum based on differences between
synthetic observables at different ALMA receiver sub-bands (2.8-3.2 mm; band 3)
and (1.20-1.31 mm; band 6) from a state-of-the-art 3D rMHD simulation. The
slope of the continuum is coupled to the small-scale dynamics and a positive
sign indicates an increase in temperature with height while a negative sign
implies a decrease. Network patches are dominated by large positive slopes
while quiet Sun region show a mixture of positive and negative slopes, much in
connection to propagating shock waves and the temporal evolution of the slopes
can therefore be used to identify shocks. The observability of the slope of
brightness temperatures is estimated for angular resolutions corresponding to
ALMA observations. The simulations also show that the radiation of both bands 3
and 6 can origin from several components at different heights simultaneously
and that the delay of shock signatures between two wavelengths does not
necessarily reflect the propagation speed, but could be caused by different

the mean and variance of the squared Bures distance between reduced density
matrices generated using coupled kicked tops, and a correlated spin chain

methods for chemical reactive flows. There are several difficulties in
constructing suitable numerical schemes. First of all, the density and internal
energy are positive, and the mass fraction of each species is between 0 and 1.
Secondly, due to the rapid reaction rate, the system may contain stiff sources,
and the strong-stability-preserving explicit Runge-Kutta method may result in
limited time step sizes. To obtain physically relevant numerical
approximations, we apply the bound-preserving technique to the DG methods. For
time discretization, we apply the modified Runge-Kutta/multi-step Patankar
methods, which are explicit for the flux while implicit for the source. Such
methods can handle stiff sources with relatively large time steps, preserve the
positivity of the target variables, and keep the summation of the mass
fractions to be 1. Finally, it is not straightforward to combine the
bound-preserving DG methods and the Patankar time integrations. The
positivity-preserving technique for DG method requires positive numerical
approximations at the cell interfaces, while Patankar methods can keep the
positivity of the pre-selected point-values of the target variables. To match
the degree of freedom, we use $Q^k$ polynomials on rectangular meshes for
problems in two space dimensions. To evolve in time, we first read the
polynomials at the Gaussian points. Then suitable slope limiters can be applied
to enforce the positivity of the solutions at those points, which can be
preserved by the Patankar methods, leading to positive updated numerical cell
averages. In addition, we use another slope limiter to get positive solutions
used for the bound-preserving technique for the flux.

renormalizable, but also to get rid of these ghost modes that arise from higher

theory and highlighting how to deal with this new kind of nonlocal operators.

confirms the potential of topology optimization for power grid operation,

charging station as its destination and a route to get there at the same time.
However, the traffic and electrical load congestion on the roads and charging
stations lead to the interdependencies between the optimal decisions of EVs.
CSOs and the TNO need to apply some tolling to control such congestion. On the
other hand, the pricing at charging stations depends on real-time
distributional locational marginal pricing, which is determined by the DSO
after solving the optimal power flow over the power distribution network. This
paper also takes into account the local and the coupling/infrastructure

cognitive functions. Neurons within the same region are more likely to connect
than neurons in distinct regions, making the brain network to have
characteristics of a network of subnetworks. The values of synaptic delays
between neurons of different subnetworks are greater than those of the same
subnetworks. This difference in communication time between neurons has
consequences on the firing patterns observed in the brain, which is directly
related to changes in neural connectivity, known as synaptic plasticity. In
this work, we build a plastic network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons in which the
connectivity modifications follow a spike-time dependent rule. We define an
internal-delay among neurons communicating within the same subnetwork, an
external-delay for neurons belonging to distinct subnetworks, and study how
these communicating delays affect the entire network dynamics. We observe that
the neuronal network exhibits a specific connectivity configuration for each
synchronised pattern. Our results show how synaptic delays and plasticity work
together to promote the formation of structural coupling among the neuronal
subnetworks. We conclude that plastic neuronal networks are able to promote
equivalence between function and structure meaning that topology emerges from
behaviour and behaviour emerges from topology, creating a complex dynamical
process where topology adapts to conform with the plastic rules and firing
patterns reflect the changes on the synaptic weights.

quadratic binary programs. We give an explicit description of objective
functions where the Shor relaxation is exact and use this knowledge to design

the only observationally confirmed case of this being WASP-12 b. By examining
this effect, information on the properties of the host star can be obtained
using the so-called stellar modified tidal quality factor $Q_*'$, which
describes the efficiency with which kinetic energy of the planet is dissipated
within the star. This can help to get information about the interior of the
star. In this study, we aim to improve constraints on the tidal decay of the
KELT-9, KELT-16 and WASP-4 systems, to find evidence for or against the
presence of this particular effect. With this, we want to constrain each star's
respective $Q_*'$ value. In addition to that, we also aim to test the existence
of the transit timing variations (TTVs) in the HD 97658 system, which
previously favoured a quadratic trend with increasing orbital period. Making
use of newly acquired photometric observations from CHEOPS and TESS, combined
with archival transit and occultation data, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithms to fit three models, a constant period model, an orbital
decay model, and an apsidal precession model, to the data. We find that the
KELT-9 system is best described by an apsidal precession model for now, with an
orbital decay trend at over 2 $\sigma$ being a possible solution as well. A
Keplerian orbit model with a constant orbital period fits the transit timings
of KELT-16 b the best due to the scatter and scale of their error bars. The
WASP-4 system is represented the best by an orbital decay model at a 5 $\sigma$
significance, although apsidal precession cannot be ruled out with the present
data. For HD 97658 b, using recently acquired transit observations, we find no
conclusive evidence for a previously suspected strong quadratic trend in the
data.

Implementing these techniques allows the GPU-Accelerated Parallel FDTD code to

Third, we connect logistic growth with Gompertzian growth by augmenting the
logistic growth equation with higher order interaction terms, and show that the
SIR model family is compatible with Gompertzian growth only when all nodes in
the transmission network communicate with infinite speed and interaction.
Crucially, this augmentation must be accompanied by a causality-reversal where
the source of growth is not the pool of infected but the pool of susceptible

simultaneous optimization of multiple targets through Pareto optimization,
generating a Pareto front after a single run without manual weight adjustment

optimal solutions that meet various requirements while respecting trade-off
relationships between conflicting objectives such as intensity and focality.
MOVEA is versatile and suitable for both transcranial alternating current

failures. Modeling an infrastructure system as a collection of interdependent
networks has recently received attention as a way to explain cascading
failures. In this study, we propose an approach to find the set of critical
nodes in an interdependent network. For an integer k, we say that a set of k
nodes is critical if the initial failures of these k nodes result in the most
severe cascading failure among all sets of k nodes. This approach adopts the
seminal model of interdependent networks proposed by Buldyrev et al., in which
new link failures occur in a network if the connectivity is lost in the paired
network. The problem of finding critical nodes is NP-hard; thus the aim of the
approach is to accurately solve the problem in feasible time for moderate-size
problem instances. The proposed approach consists of two phases. In the first
phase, the maximum number of failure propagation stages is computed by
repeatedly solving the Boolean satisfiability problem. This number is then used
in the second phase, where the set of critical nodes is computed using integer
linear programming. The results of applying this approach to a variety of
problem instances demonstrate that the approach is feasible for up to at least
30 nodes and can be used as the baseline to compare the performance of
heuristic solutions.

fundamental pharmacokinetics (PK) property of drugs, which measures how
effectively a drug molecule is distributed throughout the body. Along with the
clearance (CL), it determines the half-life and, therefore, the drug dosing
interval. However, the molecular data size limits the generalizability of the
reported machine learning models. Objective: This study aims to provide a clean
and comprehensive dataset for human VDss as the benchmarking data source,
fostering and benefiting future predictive studies. Moreover, several
predictive models were also built with machine learning regression algorithms.
Methods: The dataset was curated from 13 publicly accessible data sources and
the DrugBank database entirely from intravenous drug administration and then
underwent extensive data cleaning. The molecular descriptors were calculated
with Mordred, and feature selection was conducted for constructing predictive
models. Five machine learning methods were used to build regression models,
grid search was used to optimize hyperparameters, and ten-fold cross-validation
was used to evaluate the model. Results: An enriched dataset of VDss
(https://github.com/da-wen-er/VDss) was constructed with 2440 molecules. Among
the prediction models, the LightGBM model was the most stable and had the best
internal prediction ability with Q2 = 0.837, R2=0.814 and for the other four
models, Q2 was higher than 0.79. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge,
this is the largest dataset for VDss, which can be used as the benchmark for
computational studies of VDss. Moreover, the regression models reported within
this study can be of use for pharmacokinetic related studies.

Then the evolution always begins with an anisotropic ""Big Bang"" which happened

learning (ML), much of the focus has been placed on model development. However,
to truly realize the potential of machine learning in real-world settings,
additional aspects must be considered across the ML pipeline. Data-centric AI
is emerging as a unifying paradigm that could enable such reliable end-to-end
pipelines. However, this remains a nascent area with no standardized framework
to guide practitioners to the necessary data-centric considerations or to
communicate the design of data-centric driven ML systems. To address this gap,
we propose DC-Check, an actionable checklist-style framework to elicit
data-centric considerations at different stages of the ML pipeline: Data,
Training, Testing, and Deployment. This data-centric lens on development aims
to promote thoughtfulness and transparency prior to system development.
Additionally, we highlight specific data-centric AI challenges and research
opportunities. DC-Check is aimed at both practitioners and researchers to guide
day-to-day development. As such, to easily engage with and use DC-Check and
associated resources, we provide a DC-Check companion website

leveraging deep generative modeling. It is built on top of the machine learning
libraries JAX and Flax. At its core, flowMC uses a local sampler and a
learnable global sampler in tandem to efficiently sample posterior
distributions. While multiple chains of the local sampler generate samples over
the region of interest in the target parameter space, the package uses these
samples to train a normalizing flow model, then uses it to propose global jumps
across the parameter space. The flowMC sampler can handle non-trivial geometry,
such as multimodal distributions and distributions with local correlations.
  The key features of flowMC are summarized in the following list: * Since
flowMC is built on top of JAX, it supports gradient-based samplers through
automatic differentiation such as MALA and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). *
flowMC uses state-of-the-art normalizing flow models such as Rational-Quadratic
Splines to power its global sampler. These models are very efficient in
capturing important features within a relatively short training time. * Use of
accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs are natively supported. The code also
supports the use of multiple accelerators with SIMD parallelism. * By default,
Just-in-time (JIT) compilations are used to further speed up the sampling
process. * We provide a simple black box interface for the users who want to
use flowMC by its default parameters, yet provide at the same time an extensive
guide explaining trade-offs while tuning the sampler parameters. The tight
integration of all the above features makes flowMC a highly performant yet
simple- to-use package for statistical inference.

data augmentation scheme, where we train peptide language models on

evaluate the representation potential of models trained with chopped proteins

These peptide-specific models also retain information about the original
protein they were derived from better than language models trained on

the study developed an Energy Maximization Algorithm (EMA) capable of
extracting driving events of varying durations and frequencies from continuous

were used to classify events with highly variable patterns such as stops and
lane-keeping. To classify segmented driving events, four machine learning
models were implemented, and their accuracy and transferability were assessed
over multiple data sources. The duration of events extracted by EMA were
comparable to actual events, with accuracies ranging from 59.30% (left lane
change) to 85.60% (lane-keeping). Additionally, the overall accuracy of the
1D-convolutional neural network model was 98.99%, followed by the
Long-short-term-memory model at 97.75%, then random forest model at 97.71%, and
the support vector machine model at 97.65%. These model accuracies where

normalized coefficient {\Lambda}_n (S_n ) with mean 1 and no other parameters.
A dataset of 5500 functions {\Lambda}_n was generated using combinations of
(mixed-wet and strongly water-wet) relative permeabilities, capillary pressure
and mobility ratios. Since the possible variation in {\Lambda}_n appears
limited (mean 1, positive, zero at S_n=0, one maximum) the generated functions
span most relevant cases. The scaled diffusion equation was solved for all 5500
cases and recovery profiles were analyzed in terms of time scales and early-
and late time behavior. Scaled recovery falls exactly on the square root curve
RF=T_n^0.5 at early time. The scaled time T_n=t/{\tau}T_ch accounts for system
length L and magnitude D of the unscaled diffusion coefficient via
{\tau}=L^2/D, and T_ch accounts for {\Lambda}_n. Scaled recovery was
characterized by RF_tr (highest recovery reached as T_n^0.5) and lr, a
parameter controlling the decline in imbibition rate afterwards. This
correlation described the 5500 recovery curves with mean R^2=0.9989. RF_tr was
0.05 to 0.2 units higher than recovery when water reached the no-flow boundary.
The shape of {\Lambda}_n was quantified by three fractions z_(a,b). The

Recently, Deep Neural Network (DNN) surrogate models have gained popularity for
their hard-to-match emulation accuracy. However, it is well-known that DNN is
prone to errors when input data are perturbed in particular ways, the very
motivation for adversarial training. In the usage scenario of surrogate models,
the concern is less of a deliberate attack but more of the high sensitivity of
the DNN's accuracy to input directions, an issue largely ignored by researchers
using emulation models. In this paper, we show the severity of this issue

properties has led to various techniques to optimize geometries, mode
structures, nonlinearities and dispersion. Depending on applications, the
dispersion in such resonators counters their optical nonlinearities and
influences the intracavity optical dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate the
use of a machine learning (ML) algorithm as a tool to determine the geometry of
microresonators from their dispersion profiles. The training dataset with ~460
samples is generated by finite element simulations and the model is
experimentally verified using integrated silicon nitride microresonators. Two
ML algorithms are compared along with suitable hyperparameter tuning, out of
which Random Forest (RF) yields the best results. The average error on the
simulated data is well below 15%.

that output is not proportional to input, the biological neural networks become
highly nonlinear and thus very likely chaotic in nature. Research in control
theory reveals that strange attractors can be approximated by collection of
cycles, and be collapsed into a more coherent state centered on one of them if
we exert control. We speculate that human memories are encoded by such cycles,
and can be retrieved once sensory or virtual cues, acting as references, enable
feedback controls that nucleates the otherwise chaotic wandering mind.
