our setting corresponds to clustering mixtures of Gaussians with equal (known)
covariances. Simple spectral methods do not take into account the distribution
of the entries of these factors and are therefore often suboptimal. Here, we
characterize the asymptotics of the minimum estimation error under the
assumption that the distribution of the entries is known to the statistician.
  Our results apply to the high-dimensional regime $n, d \to \infty$ and $d / n
\to \infty$ (or $d / n \to 0$) and generalize earlier work that focused on the
proportional asymptotics $n, d \to \infty$, $d / n \to \delta \in (0, \infty)$.
We outline an interesting signal strength regime in which $d / n \to \infty$
and partial recovery is possible for the left singular vectors while impossible
for the right singular vectors.
  We illustrate the general theory by deriving consequences for Gaussian
mixture clustering and carrying out a numerical study on genomics data.

sizable built-in electric field and band alignment compatible with overall

application. We further propose a directional stress sensing device to

off from zero-energy while the one on the other side doesn't - ruling out their
MM origin. A minimal model shows that, while wide trivial minigaps hosting such
conventional end states are easily achieved in antiferromagnetic spin chains,
unrealistically large spin-orbit couplings are required to drive the system
into the topologically nontrivial phase with MMs. The methodology of perturbing
chains by local defects is a powerful tool to probe the stability of future

steps towards a low-dimensional grid-based model of molecular binding. We
discretise the state space of relative positions and orientations of the two
molecules under the rigid body assumption.The corresponding program is
published as the Python package molgri. For the rotational component of the
grids, we test algorithms based on Euler angles, polyhedra and quaternions, of
which the polyhedra-based are the most uniform. The program outputs a sequence
of molecular structures that can be easily processed by standard MD programs to
calculate grid point energies. We demonstrate the grid-based approach on two
molecular systems: a water dimer and a coiled-coil protein interacting with a
chloride anion. For the second system we relax the rigid-body assumption and
improve the accuracy of the grid point energies by an energy minimisation. In
both cases, oriented bonding patterns and energies confirm expectations from
chemical intuition and MD simulations. We also demonstrate how analysis of
energy contributions on a grid can be performed and demonstrate that
electrostatically-driven association is sufficiently resolved by point-energy
calculations. Overall, grid-based models of molecular binding are potentially a
powerful complement to molecular sampling approaches, and we see the potential

in the distribution. In this work, we build upon recent work on jointly
learning energy-based models with GFlowNets and extend it to learn the joint
over multiple variables, which we call Joint Energy-Based GFlowNets (JEBGFNs),
such as peptide sequences and their antimicrobial activity. Joint learning of
the energy-based model, used as a reward for the GFlowNet, can resolve the
issues of incompatibility since both the reward function $R$ and the GFlowNet
sampler are trained jointly. We find that this joint training or joint
energy-based formulation leads to significant improvements in generating
anti-microbial peptides. As the training sequences arose out of evolutionary or
artificial selection for high antibiotic activity, there is presumably some
structure in the distribution of sequences that reveals information about the
antibiotic activity. This results in an advantage to modeling their joint
generatively vs. pure discriminative modeling. We also evaluate JEBGFN in an

Simplicial distributions can be given the structure of a convex monoid, a

introducing a weak version of invertibility for monoids. Our main result is
that a simplicial distribution is noncontextual if and only if it is weakly
invertible. Similarly, strong contextuality and contextual fraction can be
characterized in terms of invertibility in monoids. Finally, we show that
simplicial homotopy can be used to detect extremal simplicial distributions
refining the earlier methods based on Cech cohomology and the cohomology of
groups.

applications. Existing GEL methods focus on learning useful representations for
nodes, edges, or entire graphs with ``small'' labeled data. But the problem of
data-efficient learning for subgraph prediction has not been explored. The
challenges of this problem lie in the following aspects: 1) It is crucial for
subgraphs to learn positional features to acquire structural information in the
base graph in which they exist. Although the existing subgraph neural network
method is capable of learning disentangled position encodings, the overall
computational complexity is very high. 2) Prevailing graph augmentation methods
for GEL, including rule-based, sample-based, adaptive, and automated methods,
are not suitable for augmenting subgraphs because a subgraph contains fewer
nodes but richer information such as position, neighbor, and structure.
Subgraph augmentation is more susceptible to undesirable perturbations. 3) Only
a small number of nodes in the base graph are contained in subgraphs, which
leads to a potential ``bias'' problem that the subgraph representation learning
is dominated by these ``hot'' nodes. By contrast, the remaining nodes fail to
be fully learned, which reduces the generalization ability of subgraph
representation learning. In this paper, we aim to address the challenges above
and propose a Position-Aware Data-Efficient Learning framework for subgraph
neural networks called PADEL. Specifically, we propose a novel node position
encoding method that is anchor-free, and design a new generative subgraph
augmentation method based on a diffused variational subgraph autoencoder, and
we propose exploratory and exploitable views for subgraph contrastive learning.
Extensive experiment results on three real-world datasets show the superiority
of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

and future 3GPP releases, the mobility performance of multi-panel user
equipment (MPUE) with hand blockage is still an area open for research and
standardization. In this article, a comprehensive study on the mobility
performance of MPUE with hand blockage is performed for conditional handover
(CHO) and its potential enhancement denoted by fast conditional handover
(FCHO). In contrast to CHO, in FCHO the MPUE can reuse earlier target cell
preparations after each handover to autonomously execute subsequent handovers.
This saves both the signaling overhead associated with the reconfiguration and
re-preparation of target cells after each handover and reduces mobility
failures. Results have shown that FCHO offers considerable mobility performance
gains as compared to CHO for different hand blockage cases that are dependent
on the hand position around the MPUE. For the worst-case hand blockage
scenario, it is seen that mobility failures reduce by 10.5% and 19.3% for the
60 km/h and 120 km/h mobility scenarios, respectively. This gain comes at the
expense of reserving the handover resources of an MPUE for a longer time given
that the target cell configurations are not necessarily released after each
handover. In this article, the longer resource reservation problem in FCHO is
analysed and three different resource reservation optimization techniques are
introduced. Results have shown that these optimization techniques not only
reduce the resource reservation time but also significantly reduce the
signaling overhead at the possible expense of a tolerable degradation in
mobility performance.

the Planck satellite and application of the $\Lambda CDM$ cosmological model by
at least $3 \sigma$. It is among the most challenging problems in contemporary
cosmology and is known as the Hubble tension. The SNe Ia in R11 and R16 were
calibrated through cepheid variables in three distinct galaxies: Milky Way,
LMC, and NGC4258. Carnegie Hubble Program (CHP) observations of type Ia SNe
calibrated using the tip of the red giant approach yielded a somewhat different
estimate for the Hubble constant. This decreased the Hubble tension from over
3$\sigma$ to below 2$\sigma$. It is a legitimate question to answer whether
there are any issues with SNe Ia calibration and to investigate whether the
Hubble tension is real or not. We use statistical techniques namely, ANOVA, K-S
test, and t-test to examine whether the cepheid calibration is host-dependent.
Our analysis shows that (i) both R11 and R16 data suffer from non-Gaussian
systematic effects, (ii) $H_0$ values in the sub-samples (different
anchor-based) in both R11 and R16 groups are significantly different at a 99\%
confidence level, and (iii) neglecting the metal-rich MW sample does not reduce
the $H_0$ value significantly, and thus Hubble tension persists. A small
reduction in the Hubble constant could be linked to the differences in the host
environment. Hence instead of using a single universal relation environment
based slope and zero point should be preferred.

notoriously difficult. A key method is given by X-ray Thomson scattering
(XRTS), but the interpretation of XRTS measurements is usually based on
theoretical models that entail various approximations. Recently, Dornheim et
al. [arXiv:2206.12805] have introduced a new framework for temperature
diagnostics of XRTS experiments that is based on imaginary-time correlation
functions (ITCF). On the one hand, switching from the frequency- to the
imaginary-time domain gives one direct access to a number of physical
properties, which facilitates the extraction of the temperature of arbitrarily
complex materials without any models or approximations. On the other hand, the
bulk of theoretical works in dynamic quantum many-body theory is devoted to the
frequency-domain, and, to our knowledge, the manifestation of physics
properties within the ITCF remains poorly understood. In the present work, we
aim to change this unsatisfactory situation by introducing a simple,
semi-analytical model for the imaginary-time dependence of two-body
correlations within the framework of imaginary-time path integrals. As a
practical example, we compare our new model to extensive ab initio path
integral Monte Carlo results for the ITCF of a uniform electron gas, and find
excellent agreement over a broad range of wave numbers, densities, and
temperatures.

polyploid cyanobacteria demonstrated that the probability of achieving
antibiotic resistance increased with the number of chromosomes and implied an
optimal number of chromosomes. Then, we investigated the dynamics of the same

increase their fitness. The evolutionary rate could be increased in polyploidy,
and the optimal number of chromosomes was identified. Further, we proposed that
the optimization for evolutionary innovation might determine the number of

(DNN) have been a new paradigm of turbulence modeling. However, in the scenario
of high Reynolds numbers, there are still some bottlenecks, including the lack
of high-fidelity data and the convergence and stability problem in the coupling
process of turbulence models and the RANS solvers. In this paper, we propose an
improved ensemble kalman inversion method as a unified approach of data
assimilation and turbulence modeling for separated flows at high Reynolds
numbers. The trainable parameters of the DNN are optimized according to the
given experimental surface pressure coefficients in the framework of mutual
coupling between the RANS equations and DNN eddy-viscosity models. In this way,
data assimilation and model training are combined into one step to get the
high-fidelity turbulence models agree well with experiments efficiently. The
effectiveness of the method is verified by cases of separated flows around
airfoils(S809) at high Reynolds numbers. The results show that through joint
assimilation of vary few experimental states, we can get turbulence models
generalizing well to both attached and separated flows at different angles of
attack. The errors of lift coefficients at high angles of attack are
significantly reduced by more than three times compared with the traditional SA
model. The models obtained also perform well in stability and robustness.

  linearised theory","129 pages, extended abstract in the paper",,,,"gr-qc math-ph math.AP math.DG math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We propose a new geometric framework to address the stability of the Kerr
solution to gravitational perturbations in the full sub-extremal range $|a|<M$.
Central to our framework is a new formulation of nonlinear gravitational
perturbations of Kerr, whose two novel ingredients are the choice of a
geometric gauge and non-integrable null frames both tailored to the outgoing
principal null geodesics of Kerr. The vacuum Einstein equations for the
perturbations are formulated in our gauge as a system of equations for the
connection coefficients and curvature components relative to the chosen frames.
When renormalised with respect to Kerr, the null structure equations with the
form of outgoing transport equations do not possess any derivatives of
renormalised connection coefficients on the right hand side. In this work, we
derive the linearised vacuum Einstein equations around Kerr in the new
framework.
  Our new framework is designed to effectively capture the stabilising
properties of the red-shifted transport equations, thereby isolating one of the
crucial structures of the problem. Such a feature is suggestive of future
simplifications in the analysis. As an illustration, our companion work
\cite{benomio_schwarzschild} employs the system of linearised gravity and its
enhanced red-shifted transport equations, specialised to the $|a|=0$ case, to
produce a new simplified proof of linear stability of the Schwarzschild
solution. The full linear stability analysis in the full sub-extremal range
$|a|<M$ is deferred to future work. As already apparent from
\cite{benomio_schwarzschild}, our framework will allow to combine the new
structure in the transport equations with the elliptic part of the system to
establish a linear orbital stability result without loss of derivatives,
indicating that the framework may be well suited to address nonlinear stability
in the full sub-extremal range $|a|<M$.

offer an appealing alternative, from a theoretical perspective at least, to the
principle of Empirical Risk Minimization in machine learning. Statistical
learning by Median-of-Means (MoM) basically consists in segmenting the training
data into blocks of equal size and comparing the statistical performance of
every pair of candidate decision rules on each data block: that with highest
performance on the majority of the blocks is declared as the winner. In the
context of nonparametric regression, functions having won all their duels have
been shown to outperform empirical risk minimizers w.r.t. the mean squared
error under minimal assumptions, while exhibiting robustness properties. It is
the purpose of this paper to extend this approach in order to address other
learning problems, in particular for which the performance criterion takes the
form of an expectation over pairs of observations rather than over one single
observation, as may be the case in pairwise ranking, clustering or metric
learning. Precisely, it is proved here that the bounds achieved by MoM are
essentially conserved when the blocks are built by means of independent
sampling without replacement schemes instead of a simple segmentation. These
results are next extended to situations where the risk is related to a pairwise
loss function and its empirical counterpart is of the form of a $U$-statistic.
Beyond theoretical results guaranteeing the performance of the
learning/estimation methods proposed, some numerical experiments provide
empirical evidence of their relevance in practice.

equations and their stabilising properties to control the gauge dependent part

establish both orbital and asymptotic stability for all the linearised

works, graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) approaches have
demonstrated good performance on item ranking tasks with generic
searching/matching measures (including complex measures such as neural network
measures). However, since these ANN approaches must go through the neural
measures several times during ranking, the computation is not practical if the
neural measure is a large network. On the other hand, fast item ranking using
existing hashing-based approaches, such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH),
only works with a limited set of measures. Previous learning-to-hash approaches
are also not suitable to solve the fast item ranking problem since they can
take a significant amount of time and computation to train the hash functions.
Hashing approaches, however, are attractive because they provide a principle
and efficient way to retrieve candidate items. In this paper, we propose a
simple and effective learning-to-hash approach for the fast item ranking
problem that can be used for any type of measure, including neural network
measures. Specifically, we solve this problem with an asymmetric hashing
framework based on discrete inner product fitting. We learn a pair of related
hash functions that map heterogeneous objects (e.g., users and items) into a
common discrete space where the inner product of their binary codes reveals
their true similarity defined via the original searching measure. The fast
ranking problem is reduced to an ANN search via this asymmetric hashing scheme.
Then, we propose a sampling strategy to efficiently select relevant and
contrastive samples to train the hashing model. We empirically validate the
proposed method against the existing state-of-the-art fast item ranking methods

We observe that the nearest neighbour concurrence can play a role of a good

outside the virial radius of a host halo, but their star formation can be
deeply impacted by previous interactions with more massive systems. In this

Prior observations with Hubble/WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and VLT/FORS2 have been

cloud-free atmosphere. Recently, the planet was observed with the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the Early Release Observations (ERO). 1D
profiles are extracted from the 3D GCM expeRT/MITgcm results and used as input
for a kinetic, non-equilibrium model to study the formation of mineral cloud
particles of mixed composition. The ARCiS retrieval framework is applied to the
pre-JWST WASP-96b transit spectra to investigate the apparent contradiction
between cloudy models and assumed cloud-free transit spectra. Clouds are
predicted to be ubiquitous throughout the atmosphere of WASP-96b. Silicate
materials contribute between 40% and 90%, hence, also metal oxides contribute
with up to 40% in the low-pressure regimes that effect the spectra. We explore
how to match these cloudy models with currently available atmospheric transit
spectra. A reduced vertical mixing acts to settle clouds to deeper in the
atmosphere, and an increased cloud particles porosity reduces the opacity of
clouds in the near-IR and optical region. Both these effects allow for clearer
molecular features to be observed, while still allowing clouds to be in the
atmosphere. The atmosphere of WASP-96b is unlikely to be cloud free. Also
retrievals of HST, Spitzer and VLT spectra show that multiple cloudy solutions
reproduce the data. JWST observations will be affected by clouds, where within
even the NIRISS wavelength range the cloud top pressure varies by an order of
magnitude. The long wavelength end of NIRSpec and short end of MIRI may probe
atmospheric asymmetries between the limbs of the terminator on WASP-96b.

are able to perform few-shot learning without changing model parameters.
However, as we show, fine-tuning an LLM on any specific task generally destroys
its in-context ability. We discover an important cause of this loss, format
specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task
and is unable to output anything beyond this format. We further show that
format specialization happens at the beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this
problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet
effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that preserves in-context abilities
of the pretrained model. ProMoT first trains a soft prompt for the fine-tuning
target task, and then fine-tunes the model itself with this soft prompt
attached. ProMoT offloads task-specific formats into the soft prompt that can
be removed when doing other in-context tasks. We fine-tune mT5 XXL with ProMoT
on natural language inference (NLI) and English-French translation and evaluate
the in-context abilities of the resulting models on 8 different NLP tasks.
ProMoT achieves similar performance on the fine-tuned tasks compared with
vanilla fine-tuning, but with much less reduction of in-context learning
performances across the board. More importantly, ProMoT shows remarkable
generalization ability on tasks that have different formats, e.g. fine-tuning
on a NLI binary classification task improves the model's in-context ability to
do summarization (+0.53 Rouge-2 score compared to the pretrained model), making
ProMoT a promising method to build general purpose capabilities such as
grounding and reasoning into LLMs with small but high quality datasets. When
extended to sequential or multi-task training, ProMoT can achieve even better
out-of-domain generalization performance.

globular clusters (GCs). In particular, the pseudo two-colour diagram dubbed
'chromosome map (ChM)' allowed to detect and characterize their multiple
populations with unprecedented detail. The main limitation of these studies is
the small field of view of HST, which makes it challenging to investigate some
important aspects of the multiple populations, such as their spatial
distributions and the internal kinematics in the outermost cluster regions. To
overcome this limitation, we analyse state-of-art wide-field photometry of 43
GCs obtained from ground-based facilities. We derived high-resolution reddening
maps and corrected the photometry for differential reddening when needed. We
use photometry in the U, B, and I bands to introduce the $\Delta c_{\rm U,B,I}$
vs. $\Delta_{\rm B,I}$ ChM of red-giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic-giant
branch (AGB) stars. We demonstrate that this ChM, which is built with wide-band
ground-based photometry, is an efficient tool to identify first- and
second-generation stars (1G and 2G) over a wide field of view. To illustrate
its potential, we derive the radial distribution of multiple populations in NGC
288 and infer their chemical composition. We present the ChMs of RGB stars in
29 GCs and detect a significant degree of variety. The fraction of 1G and 2G
stars, the number of subpopulations, and the extension of the ChMs
significantly change from one cluster to another. Moreover, the metal-poor and
metal-rich stars of Type II GCs define distinct sequences in the ChM. We
confirm the presence of extended 1G sequences.

brightness galaxies in the field at distances of 25-36 Mpc, with mean effective
radii and $g$-band central surface brightnesses of 1.9 kpc and 24.2 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$. Nine meet the standard criteria to be considered ultra-diffuse
galaxies (UDGs). An inspection of point-like sources brighter than the turnover
magnitude of the globular cluster luminosity function and within twice the
half-light radii of each galaxy reveals that, unlike those in denser
environments, gas-rich, field UDGs host very few old globular clusters (GCs).
Most of the targets (nine) have zero candidate GCs, with the remainder having
one or two candidates each. These findings are broadly consistent with
expectations for normal dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass. This rules out
gas-rich, field UDGs as potential progenitors of the GC-rich UDGs that are
typically found in galaxy clusters. However, some in galaxy groups may be
directly accreted from the field. In line with other recent results, this
strongly suggests that there must be at least two distinct formation pathways
for UDGs, and that this sub-population is simply an extreme low surface
brightness extension of the underlying dwarf galaxy population. The root cause
of their diffuse stellar distributions remains unclear, but the formation
mechanism appears to only impact the distribution of stars (and potentially
dark matter), without strongly impacting the distribution of neutral gas, the
overall stellar mass, or the number of GCs.

explore whether an expanding shell model can describe the velocity structure of

significant turbulence may be present in the ISM around the nucleus, which may

We consider a monolayer graphene sheet subject to a $C_2$-breaking periodic
strain-induced psuedomagnetic field (PMF) with period $L_M \gg a$, along with a
scalar potential of the same period. This system has {\it almost ideal} flat
bands with valley-resolved Chern number $\pm 1$, where the deviation from ideal
band geometry is analytically controlled and exponentially small in the
dimensionless ratio $(L_M/l_B)^2$ where $l_B$ is the magnetic length
corresponding to the maximum value of the PMF. Moreover, the scalar potential
can tune the bandwidth far below the Coulomb scale, making this a very
promising platform for strongly interacting topological phases. Using a
combination of strong-coupling theory and self-consistent Hartree fock, we find
quantum anomalous Hall states at integer fillings. At fractional filling, exact
diagonaliztion reveals a fractional Chern insulator at parameters in the
experimentally feasible range. Overall, we find that this system has larger
interaction-induced gaps, smaller quasiparticle dispersion, and enhanced
tunability compared to twisted graphene systems, even in their ideal limit.

Sun-like star (G9 V) known to host a multi-planet transiting system.
Ground-based spectroscopic observations confirmed the planetary nature of the
three transiting sub-Neptunes (HD 191939 b, c, and d) originally detected by
TESS and were used to measure the masses for planets b and c with 3$\sigma$
precision. These previous observations also reported the discovery of an
additional Saturn-mass planet (HD 191939 e) and evidence for a further, very
long-period companion (HD 191939 f). Here, we report the discovery of a new
non-transiting planet in the system and a refined mass determination of HD
191939 d. The new planet, HD 191939 g, has a minimum mass of 13.5$\pm$2.0
M$_\oplus$ and a period of about 280 d. This period places the planet within
the conservative habitable zone of the host star, and near a 1:3 resonance with
HD 191939 e. The compilation of 362 radial velocity measurements with a
baseline of 677 days from four different high-resolution spectrographs also
allowed us to refine the properties of the previously known planets, including
a 4.6$\sigma$ mass determination for planet d, for which only a 2$\sigma$ upper
limit had been set until now. We confirm the previously suspected low density
of HD 191939 d, which makes it an attractive target for attempting atmospheric
characterisation. Overall, the planetary system consists of three sub-Neptunes
interior to a Saturn-mass and a Uranus-mass planet plus a high-mass long-period
companion. This particular configuration has no counterpart in the literature
and makes HD 191939 an exceptional multi-planet transiting system with an
unusual planet demographic worthy of future observation.

result in Dicke superradiance, where the emission rate is greatly enhanced,

most commonly observed in systems with long-range interactions between the
emitters, although the minimal interaction range remains unknown. Here, we put
forward a new theoretical method to bound the maximum emission rate by upper
bounding the spectral radius of an auxiliary Hamiltonian. We harness this tool
to prove that for an arbitrary ordered array with only nearest-neighbor
interactions in all dimensions, a superradiant burst is not physically
observable. We show that Dicke superradiance requires minimally the inclusion
of next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For exponentially decaying interactions,
the critical coupling is found to be asymptotically independent of the number
of emitters in all dimensions, thereby defining the threshold interaction range
where the collective enhancement balances out the decoherence effects. Our
findings provide key physical insights to the understanding of collective decay
in many-body quantum systems, and the designing of superradiant emission in
physical systems for applications such as energy harvesting and quantum
sensing.

masses, which in turn are used to determine cosmological parameters. However,
systematic differences between the temperatures measured by different
telescopes imply a significant source of systematic uncertainty on such mass
estimates. We perform the first systematic comparison between cluster
temperatures measured with Chandra and NuSTAR. This provides a useful
contribution to the effort of cross-calibrating cluster temperatures due to the
harder response of NuSTAR compared with most other observatories. We measure
average temperatures for 8 clusters observed with NuSTAR and Chandra. We fit
the NuSTAR spectra in a hard (3-10 keV) energy band, and the Chandra spectra in
both the hard and a broad (0.6-9 keV) band. We fit a power-law
cross-calibration model to the resulting temperatures. At a Chandra temperature
of 10 keV, the average NuSTAR temperature was $(10.5 \pm 3.7)\%$ and $(15.7 \pm
4.6)\%$ lower than Chandra for the broad and hard band fits respectively. We
explored the impact of systematics from background modelling and multiphase
temperature structure of the clusters, and found that these did not affect our
results. Our sample are primarily merging clusters with complex thermal
structures so are not ideal calibration targets. However, given the harder
response of NuSTAR it would be expected to measure a higher average temperature
than Chandra for a non-isothermal cluster, so we interpret our measurement as a
lower limit on the difference in temperatures between NuSTAR and Chandra.

  Problems with Chance Constraints",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate an empirical quantile estimation approach to solve
chance-constrained nonlinear optimization problems. Our approach is based on
the reformulation of the chance constraint as an equivalent quantile constraint
to provide stronger signals on the gradient. In this approach, the value of the
quantile function is estimated empirically from samples drawn from the random
parameters, and the gradient of the quantile function is estimated via a
finite-difference approximation on top of the quantile-function-value
estimation. We establish a convergence theory of this approach within the
framework of an augmented Lagrangian method for solving general nonlinear
constrained optimization problems. The foundation of the convergence analysis
is a concentration property of the empirical quantile process, and the analysis
is divided based on whether or not the quantile function is differentiable. In
contrast to the sampling-and-smoothing approach used in the literature, the
method developed in this paper does not involve any smoothing function and
hence the quantile-function gradient approximation is easier to implement and
there are less accuracy-control parameters to tune. Numerical investigation
shows that our approach can also identify high-quality solutions, especially
with a relatively large step size for the finite difference estimation, which
works intuitively as an implicit smoothing. The observation points out a
possibility that an explicit smoothing is not always necessary to handle the
chance constraints. It is likely that just by improving the estimation of the
quantile-function value and gradient itself could already lead to high
performance for solving the chance-constrained nonlinear programs.

adaptive meshing framework, such that resolution can be placed where needed,
for example at the borehole wall, to further improve the computational
efficiency of large scale simulations. This approach allows for both the
heating of the rock, and the removal of evaporated material, allowing rate of
penetration and the shape of the resulting borehole to be quantified. The model
is validated against experimental results, which indicates that the approach
can accurately predict temperatures, and temperature gradients within the rock.
The validated model is then exercised to obtain initial results demonstrating
its capabilities for simulating the millimetre wave drilling process. The
effects of the conditions at the surface of the rock are investigated,
highlighting the importance of understanding the physical processes which occur
between the wave guide and the rock. Additionally, the absorptivity of the
rock, and the impact this has on the evaporation behaviour is considered.
Simulations are carried out both for isotropic rock, and also for a
multi-strata configuration. It is found that strata between similar rock types,
such as granite and basalt, absorptive properties pose little problem for
uniform drilling. However, larger variations in material parameters are shown
to have strong implications on the evaporation behaviour of the wellbore, and

benefit to deep learning practitioners. Distillation is typically used to
compress models or improve model quality, but it's unclear if distillation
actually improves training efficiency. Can the quality improvements of
distillation be converted into training speed-ups, or do they simply increase
final model quality with no resource savings? We conducted a series of
experiments to investigate whether and how distillation can be used to
accelerate training using ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet and BERT trained on C4
with a masked language modeling objective and evaluated on GLUE, using common
enterprise hardware (8x NVIDIA A100). We found that distillation can speed up
training by up to 1.96x in ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet and up to 1.42x on
BERT when evaluated on GLUE. Furthermore, distillation for BERT yields optimal
results when it is only performed for the first 20-50% of training. We also
observed that training with distillation is almost always more efficient than
training without distillation, even when using the poorest-quality model as a
teacher, in both ResNet-50 and BERT. Finally, we found that it's possible to
gain the benefit of distilling from an ensemble of teacher models, which has
O(n) runtime cost, by randomly sampling a single teacher from the pool of
teacher models on each step, which only has a O(1) runtime cost. Taken
together, these results show that distillation can substantially improve
training efficiency in both image classification and language modeling, and
that a few simple optimizations to distillation protocols can further enhance
these efficiency improvements.

research attention and many related methods have surged such as
hypergraph-based methods, span-based methods, and sequence-to-sequence
(Seq2Seq) methods, etc. However, these methods more or less suffer from some
problems such as decoding ambiguity and efficiency, which limit their
performance. Recently, grid-tagging methods, which benefit from the flexible
design of tagging systems and model architectures, have shown superiority to
adapt for various information extraction tasks. In this paper, we follow the
line of such methods and propose a competitive grid-tagging model for
discontinuous NER. We call our model TOE because we incorporate two kinds of
Tag-Oriented Enhancement mechanisms into a state-of-the-art (SOTA) grid-tagging
model that casts the NER problem into word-word relationship prediction. First,
we design a Tag Representation Embedding Module (TREM) to force our model to
consider not only word-word relationships but also word-tag and tag-tag
relationships. Concretely, we construct tag representations and embed them into
TREM, so that TREM can treat tag and word representations as
queries/keys/values and utilize self-attention to model their relationships. On
the other hand, motivated by the Next-Neighboring-Word (NNW) and Tail-Head-Word
(THW) tags in the SOTA model, we add two new symmetric tags, namely
Previous-Neighboring-Word (PNW) and Head-Tail-Word (HTW), to model more

electromagnetic spectrum has been the primary means of investigating the
physics behind these sources, although independent diagnostic tools have been
developed to inform and corroborate assumptions made in particle acceleration
simulations and broadband studies. We present a methodology to constrain three
physical parameters related to electron acceleration in GRB blast waves: the
fraction of shock energy in electrons, $\epsilon_e$; the fraction of electrons
that gets accelerated into a power-law distribution of energies, $\xi_e$; and
the minimum Lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons, $\gamma_m$. These
parameters are constrained by observations of the peaks in radio afterglow
light curves and spectral energy distributions. From a sample of 49 radio
afterglows, we are able to find narrow distributions for these parameters,
hinting at possible universality of the blast wave microphysics, although
observational bias could play a role in this. Using radio peaks and
considerations related to the prompt gamma-ray emission efficiency, we
constrain the allowed parameter ranges for both $\epsilon_e$ and $\xi_e$ to
within about one order of magnitude, $0.01\lesssim\epsilon_e\lesssim0.2$ and
$0.1\lesssim\xi_e\lesssim1$. Such stringent constraints are inaccessible for
$\xi_e$ from broadband studies due to model degeneracies.

significant parallel (to the background magnetic field) heating for both Helium
ions and protons due to the formation of beams and plateaus in their velocity
distribution functions along the background magnetic field. The heating of
Helium ions in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field starts with a
lower rate than that in the parallel direction, but overtakes the parallel
heating after a few hundreds of the proton gyro-periods due to cyclotron
resonances with mainly obliquely propagating waves induced by the cascade of
injected Helium ion cyclotron waves at large scales. There is however little
evidence for proton heating in the perpendicular direction due to the absence
of left-handed polarized cyclotron waves near the proton cyclotron frequency.
Our results are useful for understanding the preferential heating of
${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and other heavy ions in the ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$-rich solar

the projected rotational velocities (Vsini) of 2,184 stars along the split main
sequence and on the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) of the 100 Myr-old massive
(10^5 M_sun) star cluster NGC 1850 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. At fixed

sense that fast rotators appear redder. The average Vsini values for stars on
the blue and red branches of the split main sequence are ~100 km/s and ~200
km/s, respectively. The values correspond to about 25-30% and 50-60% of the
critical rotation velocity and imply that rotation rates comparable to those
observed in field stars of similar masses can explain the split main sequence.
Our spectroscopic sample contains a rich population of ~200 fast rotating Be
stars. The presence of shell features suggests that 23% of them are observed
through their decretion disks, corresponding to a disk opening angle of 15
degrees. These shell stars can significantly alter the shape of the MSTO, hence
care should be taken when interpreting this photometric feature. Overall, our
findings impact our understanding of the evolution of young massive clusters

convergence of our method is supergeometric. Guided by our analysis, we
construct a fast and robust method for estimating the optimal scaling factor

whose guided electromagnetic modes are endowed with pseudo-spin degree of

potentials acting on it, enables control over the guided modes which is
unattainable in conventional optical waveguides. In particular, we use a

criteria (evenly-spaced-by-eye, binned, and a quantitative selection function).
Using an injection-recovery technique, we test how robustly individual-planet
atmospheric parameters and population-level parameters can be retrieved. We
find that all three survey designs result in equally suitable targets for
individual atmospheric characterization, but not equally suitable targets for
constraining population parameters. Only samples constructed with a
quantitative method or that are sufficiently evenly-spaced-by-eye result in
robust population parameter constraints. Furthermore, we find that the sample
with the best targets for individual atmospheric study does not necessarily
result in the best constrained population parameters. The method of sample
selection must be considered. We also find that there may be large variability

  Quasi-Periodic Eruptions","Submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classical radiation pressure instability has been a persistent
theoretical feature of thin, radiatively efficient accretion disks with
accretion rates 1 to 100 per cent of the Eddington rate. But there is only
limited evidence of its occurrence in nature: rapid heartbeat oscillations of a
few X-ray binaries and now, perhaps, the new class of hourly X-ray transients
called quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). The accretion disks formed in tidal
disruption events (TDEs) have been observed to peacefully trespass through the
range of unstable accretion rates without exhibiting any clear sign of the
instability. We try to explain the occurrence or otherwise of this instability
in these systems, by constructing steady state 1D models of thin magnetic
accretion disks. The local magnetic pressure in the disk is assumed to be
dominated by toroidal fields arising from a dynamo sourced by
magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We choose a physically motivated
criterion of MRI saturation, validated by recent magnetohydrodynamic
simulations, to determine the strength of magnetic pressure in the disk. The
resulting magnetic pressure support efficiently shrinks: (1) the parameter
space of unstable mass accretion rates, explaining the absence of instability
in systems such as TDEs and (2) the range of unstable radii in the inner
accretion disk, which can shorten the quasi-periods of instability limit-cycles
by more than three orders of magnitude, explaining the observed periods ( a few
hrs) of QPEs. In addition to examining stability properties of strongly
magnetized disks, we predict other observational signatures such as spectral
hardening factors and jet luminosities to test the compatibility of our disk
models with observations of apparently stable TDE disks.

with a sharp interface remain a challenging task for numerics. We consider the
isothermal Euler equations with phase transition between a liquid and a vapor

transfer across the phase boundary is modeled by a kinetic relation. Existence
and uniqueness results were proven in Ref. \cite{Hantke2019a}. Using sharp
interfaces for simulating nucleation and cavitation results in the grid
containing tiny cells that are several orders of magnitude smaller than the
remaining grid cells. This forces explicit time stepping schemes to take tiny
time steps on these cells. As a remedy we suggest an explicit implicit domain
splitting where the majority of the grid cells is treated explicitly and only
the neighborhood of the tiny cells is treated implicitly. We use dual time
stepping to solve the resulting small implicit systems. Our numerical results
indicate that the new scheme is robust and provides significant speed-up

fiber bundles constructed from diffusion weighted MRI (dMRI), acting as
highways for neural activity. There has been abundant interest in studying how
the structural connectome varies across individuals in relation to their
traits, ranging from age and gender to neuropsychiatric outcomes. After
applying tractography to dMRI to get white matter fiber bundles, a key question
is how to represent the brain connectome to facilitate statistical analyses
relating connectomes to traits. The current standard divides the brain into
regions of interest (ROIs), and then relies on an adjacency matrix (AM)
representation. Each cell in the AM is a measure of connectivity, e.g., number
of fiber curves, between a pair of ROIs. Although the AM representation is
intuitive, a disadvantage is the high-dimensionality due to the large number of
cells in the matrix. This article proposes a simpler tree representation of the
brain connectome, which is motivated by ideas in computational topology and
takes topological and biological information on the cortical surface into
consideration. We demonstrate that our tree representation preserves useful
information and interpretability, while reducing dimensionality to improve
statistical and computational efficiency. Applications to data from the Human

as they lead to patterns of genetic heritability that are unexpected under

development of methods to infer these varied hybridization events, both methods
that reconstruct networks directly, and summary methods that predict individual
hybridization events. However, a lack of empirical comparisons between methods
- especially pertaining to large networks with varied hybridization scenarios -
hinders their practical use. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of popular
summary methods: TICR, MSCquartets, HyDe, Patterson's D-Statistic (ABBA-BABA),
D3, and Dp. TICR and MSCquartets are based on quartet concordance factors
gathered from gene tree topologies and Patterson's D-Statistic, D3, and Dp use
site pattern frequencies to identify hybridization events. We then use
simulated data to address questions of method accuracy and ideal use scenarios
by testing methods against complex networks which depict gene flow events that
differ in depth (timing), quantity (single vs. multiple, overlapping
hybridizations), and rate of gene flow. We find that deeper or multiple
hybridization events may introduce noise and weaken the signal of
hybridization, leading to higher false negative rates across methods. Despite
some forms of hybridization eluding quartet-based detection methods,
MSCquartets displays high precision in most scenarios. While HyDe results in
high false negative rates when tested on hybridizations involving ghost
lineages, HyDe is the only method to be able to separate hybrid vs parent
signals. Lastly, we test the methods on ultraconserved elements from the bee

previously-collected dataset of interactions, has received significant
attention over the past years. Much effort has focused on improving offline RL
practicality by addressing the prevalent issue of partial data coverage through
various forms of conservative policy learning. While the majority of algorithms
do not have finite-sample guarantees, several provable conservative offline RL
algorithms are designed and analyzed within the single-policy concentrability
framework that handles partial coverage. Yet, in the nonlinear function
approximation setting where confidence intervals are difficult to obtain,
existing provable algorithms suffer from computational intractability,
prohibitively strong assumptions, and suboptimal statistical rates. In this
paper, we leverage the marginalized importance sampling (MIS) formulation of RL
and present the first set of offline RL algorithms that are statistically
optimal and practical under general function approximation and single-policy
concentrability, bypassing the need for uncertainty quantification. We identify
that the key to successfully solving the sample-based approximation of the MIS
problem is ensuring that certain occupancy validity constraints are nearly
satisfied. We enforce these constraints by a novel application of the augmented
Lagrangian method and prove the following result: with the MIS formulation,
augmented Lagrangian is enough for statistically optimal offline RL. In stark
contrast to prior algorithms that induce additional conservatism through
methods such as behavior regularization, our approach provably eliminates this
need and reinterprets regularizers as ""enforcers of occupancy validity"" than
""promoters of conservatism.""

\Omega_b, h, n_s, \sigma_8$. We derive significant constraints on $\Omega_m$
and $\sigma_8$, which are consistent with previous works. Our constraints on
$\sigma_8$ are $27\%$ more precise than standard analyses. This improvement is
equivalent to the statistical gain expected from analyzing a galaxy sample that
is $\sim60\%$ larger than CMASS with standard methods. It results from
additional cosmological information on non-linear scales beyond the limit of
current analytic models, $k > 0.25\,h/{\rm Mpc}$. While we focus on $P_\ell$ in
this work for validation and comparison to the literature, ${\rm S{\scriptsize
IM}BIG}$ provides a framework for analyzing galaxy clustering using any summary
statistic. We expect further improvements on cosmological constraints from
subsequent ${\rm S{\scriptsize IM}BIG}$ analyses of summary statistics beyond
$P_\ell$.

algorithms: private mechanisms which perform well with very high probability
are automatically robust in the sense that they retain accuracy even if a
constant fraction of the samples they receive are adversarially corrupted.
Since optimal mechanisms typically achieve these high success probabilities,
our results imply that optimal private mechanisms for many basic statistics
problems are robust.
  We investigate the consequences of this observation for both algorithms and
computational complexity across different statistical problems. Assuming the
Brennan-Bresler secret-leakage planted clique conjecture, we demonstrate a
fundamental tradeoff between computational efficiency, privacy leakage, and
success probability for sparse mean estimation. Private algorithms which match
this tradeoff are not yet known -- we achieve that (up to polylogarithmic
factors) in a polynomially-large range of parameters via the Sum-of-Squares
method.
  To establish an information-computation gap for private sparse mean
estimation, we also design new (exponential-time) mechanisms using fewer
samples than efficient algorithms must use. Finally, we give evidence for
privacy-induced information-computation gaps for several other statistics and

Touch can, for example, help people calm down and lower physiological stress

different intensities of tactile interaction modulate physiological measures
and task performance. We use a paradigm in which a small humanoid robot is used
to encourage risk-taking behaviour, relying on peer encouragement to take more
risks which might lead to a higher pay-off, but potentially also to higher
losses. For this, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is used as a proxy for
the propensity to take risks. We study four conditions, one control condition

well-researched topics in machine learning, the study of interaction between
these two topics is still relatively new. We perform a detailed empirical study
on how the Gaussian mechanism for differential privacy and gradient compression
jointly impact test accuracy in deep learning. The existing literature in
gradient compression mostly evaluates compression in the absence of
differential privacy guarantees, and demonstrate that sufficiently high
compression rates reduce accuracy. Similarly, existing literature in
differential privacy evaluates privacy mechanisms in the absence of
compression, and demonstrates that sufficiently strong privacy guarantees
reduce accuracy. In this work, we observe while gradient compression generally
has a negative impact on test accuracy in non-private training, it can
sometimes improve test accuracy in differentially private training.
Specifically, we observe that when employing aggressive sparsification or rank
reduction to the gradients, test accuracy is less affected by the Gaussian
noise added for differential privacy. These observations are explained through
an analysis how differential privacy and compression effects the bias and
variance in estimating the average gradient. We follow this study with a
recommendation on how to improve test accuracy under the context of
differentially private deep learning and gradient compression. We evaluate this
proposal and find that it can reduce the negative impact of noise added by
differential privacy mechanisms on test accuracy by up to 24.6%, and reduce the
negative impact of gradient sparsification on test accuracy by up to 15.1%.

of the process significantly overestimate the gate error rate due to photon

the detuning dependence of the scattered photon frequency and Lamb-Dicke
parameter, a second scattering process, interference effects on scattering
rates to metastable manifolds, and the counter-rotating contribution to the
Raman transition rate. The resulting improved model shows that there is no
fundamental limit on gate error due to photon scattering for electronic ground
state qubits in commonly-used trapped-ion species when the Raman laser beams
are red detuned from the main optical transition. Additionally, photon
scattering errors are studied for qubits encoded in metastable $D_{5/2}$

commonly-used trapped ions.

X-ray radiation, stimulating the development of low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging
methods. Lowering the radiation dose reduces the health risks but leads to
noisier measurements, which decreases the tissue contrast and causes artifacts
in CT images. Ultimately, these issues could affect the perception of medical
personnel and could cause misdiagnosis. Modern deep learning noise suppression
methods alleviate the challenge but require low-noise-high-noise CT image pairs
for training, rarely collected in regular clinical workflows. In this work, we
introduce a new self-supervised approach for CT denoising Noise2NoiseTD-ANM
that can be trained without the high-dose CT projection ground truth images.
Unlike previously proposed self-supervised techniques, the introduced method
exploits the connections between the adjacent projections and the actual model
of CT noise distribution. Such a combination allows for interpretable
no-reference denoising using nothing but the original noisy LDCT projections.
Our experiments with LDCT data demonstrate that the proposed method reaches the
level of the fully supervised models, sometimes superseding them, easily
generalizes to various noise levels, and outperforms state-of-the-art
self-supervised denoising algorithms.

objective of another order of magnitude in a medium-sized area has successfully
been reached bringing SPHERE raw speckle contrast from about $10^{-6}$ to
$10^{-7}$. The algorithm has therefore proven its value and will be further

Field Conjugation is more effective for follow-up studies in order to improve
the quality of the observations. Indeed the area for a good correction is very
limited. It can't be used for exo-planets discovery unless the corrected area
is made big enough but the performance will be less.

well. In this paper, we analyze the effect on fairness in the context of graph
data (node attributes) imputation using different embedding and neural network
methods. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate severe fairness
issues in missing data imputation under graph node classification. We also find
that the choice of the imputation method affects both fairness and accuracy.
Our results provide valuable insights into graph data fairness and how to
handle missingness in graphs efficiently. This work also provides directions
regarding theoretical studies on fairness in graph data.

  Survival Time",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The restricted mean survival time is a clinically easy-to-interpret measure
that does not require any assumption of proportional hazards. We focus on two
ways to directly model the survival time and adjust the covariates. One is to
calculate the pseudo-survival time for each subject using leave-one-out, and
then perform a model analysis using all pseudo-values to adjust for covariates.
The pseudo-survival time is used to reflect information of censored subjects in
the model analysis. The other method adjusts for covariates using subjects for
whom the time-to-event was observed while adjusting for the censored subjects
using the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). This paper
evaluates the performance of these two methods in terms of the power to detect
group differences through a simple example dataset and computer simulations.
The simple example illustrates the intuitive behavior of the two methods. With
the method using pseudo-survival times, it is difficult to interpret the
pseudo-values. We confirm that the pseudo-survival times are different from the
actual data obtained in a primary biliary cholangitis clinical trial because of
the many censored data. In the simulations, the method using IPCW is found to
be more powerful. Even in the case of group differences with respect to the
censor incidence rates and covariates, the method using IPCW maintains a
nominal significance level for the type-1 error rate. We conclude that the IPCW
method should be used to estimate the restricted mean survival time when
adjusting the covariates.

leveraging the forward knowledge transfer and the backward knowledge transfer,

catastrophic forgetting in neural networks by minimizing the modification of
the learnt model for old tasks. This inevitably limits the backward knowledge
transfer from the new task to the old tasks, because judicious model updates
could possibly improve the learning performance of the old tasks as well. To
tackle this problem, we first theoretically analyze the conditions under which
updating the learnt model of old tasks could be beneficial for CL and also lead
to backward knowledge transfer, based on the gradient projection onto the input
subspaces of old tasks. Building on the theoretical analysis, we next develop a
ContinUal learning method with Backward knowlEdge tRansfer (CUBER), for a fixed
capacity neural network without data replay. In particular, CUBER first
characterizes the task correlation to identify the positively correlated old
tasks in a layer-wise manner, and then selectively modifies the learnt model of
the old tasks when learning the new task. Experimental studies show that CUBER
can even achieve positive backward knowledge transfer on several existing CL
benchmarks for the first time without data replay, where the related baselines
still suffer from catastrophic forgetting (negative backward knowledge
transfer). The superior performance of CUBER on the backward knowledge transfer
also leads to higher accuracy accordingly.

well-recognized as a multimodal phenomenon but is most commonly detected by
sensing the sound of laughter. It is unclear how perception and annotation of
laughter differ when annotated from other modalities like video, via the body
movements of laughter. In this paper we take a first step in this direction by
asking if and how well laughter can be annotated when only audio, only video
(containing full body movement information) or audiovisual modalities are
available to annotators. We ask whether annotations of laughter are congruent
across modalities, and compare the effect that labeling modality has on machine
learning model performance. We compare annotations and models for laughter
detection, intensity estimation, and segmentation, three tasks common in
previous studies of laughter. Our analysis of more than 4000 annotations
acquired from 48 annotators revealed evidence for incongruity in the perception
of laughter, and its intensity between modalities. Further analysis of
annotations against consolidated audiovisual reference annotations revealed
that recall was lower on average for video when compared to the audio
condition, but tended to increase with the intensity of the laughter samples.
Our machine learning experiments compared the performance of state-of-the-art
unimodal (audio-based, video-based and acceleration-based) and multi-modal
models for different combinations of input modalities, training label modality,
and testing label modality. Models with video and acceleration inputs had
similar performance regardless of training label modality, suggesting that it
may be entirely appropriate to train models for laughter detection from body
movements using video-acquired labels, despite their lower inter-rater
agreement.

classification (CTC)-based model on unlabeled data by continuously generating
pseudo-labels on the fly and improving their quality. In contrast to
autoregressive formulations, such as the attention-based encoder-decoder and
transducer, CTC is well suited for MPL, or PL-based semi-supervised ASR in
general, owing to its simple/fast inference algorithm and robustness against
generating collapsed labels. However, CTC generally yields inferior performance
than the autoregressive models due to the conditional independence assumption,
thereby limiting the performance of MPL. We propose to enhance MPL by
introducing intermediate loss, inspired by the recent advances in CTC-based
modeling. Specifically, we focus on self-conditional and hierarchical
conditional CTC, that apply auxiliary CTC losses to intermediate layers such
that the conditional independence assumption is explicitly relaxed. We also
explore how pseudo-labels should be generated and used as supervision for
intermediate losses. Experimental results in different semi-supervised settings
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms MPL and improves an ASR

is a major challenge in single-cell transcriptomics. Here, we present Geodesic
Sinkhorn, a method for interpolating populations along a data manifold that
leverages existing kernels developed for single-cell dimensionality reduction
and visualization methods. Our Geodesic Sinkhorn method uses a heat-geodesic
ground distance that, as compared to Euclidean ground distances, is more
accurate for interpolating single-cell dynamics on a wide variety of datasets
and significantly speeds up the computation for sparse kernels. We first apply
Geodesic Sinkhorn to 10 single-cell transcriptomics time series interpolation
datasets as a drop-in replacement for existing interpolation methods where it
outperforms on all datasets, showing its effectiveness in modeling cell
dynamics. Second, we show how to efficiently approximate the operator with
polynomial kernels allowing us to improve scaling to large datasets. Finally,
we define the conditional Wasserstein-average treatment effect and show how it
can elucidate the treatment effect on single-cell populations on a drug screen.

networks to achieve human-level performance in the medical field when
sufficient training data is provided. Such networks however fail to generalize
when tasked with predicting semantic maps for out-of-distribution images,
requiring model re-training on the new distributions. This expensive process
necessitates expert knowledge in order to generate training labels.
Distribution shifts can arise naturally in the medical field via the choice of
imaging device, i.e. MRI or CT scanners. To combat the need for labeling images
in a target domain after a model is successfully trained in a fully annotated
\textit{source domain} with a different data distribution, unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) can be used. Most UDA approaches ensure target generalization
by creating a shared source/target latent feature space. This allows a source
trained classifier to maintain performance on the target domain. However most
UDA approaches require joint source and target data access, which may create
privacy leaks with respect to patient information. We propose an UDA algorithm
for medical image segmentation that does not require access to source data
during adaptation, and is thus capable in maintaining patient data privacy. We
rely on an approximation of the source latent features at adaptation time, and
create a joint source/target embedding space by minimizing a distributional
distance metric based on optimal transport. We demonstrate our approach is
competitive to recent UDA medical segmentation works even with the added
privacy requisite.

Based on its observed properties and location on the Galactic plane, we suggest
that the Cassiopeia Filament is a spur of the Local arm, which is formed due to

gradients, are detected in the shell. The CO kinematics suggest that the large
shell is expanding at a velocity of ~6.5 km/s. Both the shell and finger-like
structures outline a giant bubble with a radius of ~16 pc, which is likely
produced by stellar wind from the progenitor star of a supernova remnant. The
observed spectral linewidths suggest that the whole Cassiopeia Filament was
quiescent initially until its west part was blown by stellar wind and became

points from two probability distributions, $\mu$ and $\nu$, which is useful in
many applications. Available algorithms for computing these maps do not appear
to scale well to high dimensions. In deep learning applications, efficient
algorithms have been developed for approximating solutions of the dual problem,
known as Kantorovich potentials, using neural networks (e.g. [Gulrajani et al.,
2017]). Importantly, such algorithms work well in high dimensions. In this
paper we present an approach towards computing Wasserstein 1 optimal transport
maps that relies only on Kantorovich potentials. In general, a Wasserstein 1
optimal transport map is not unique and is not computable from a potential
alone. Our main result is to prove that if $\mu$ has a density and $\nu$ is
supported on a submanifold of codimension at least 2, an optimal transport map
is unique and can be written explicitly in terms of a potential. These
assumptions are natural in many image processing contexts and other
applications. When the Kantorovich potential is only known approximately, our
result motivates an iterative procedure wherein data is moved in optimal
directions and with the correct average displacement. Since this provides an
approach for transforming one distribution to another, it can be used as a
multipurpose algorithm for various transport problems; we demonstrate through
several proof of concept experiments that this algorithm successfully performs
various imaging tasks, such as denoising, generation, translation and
deblurring, which normally require specialized techniques.

their ground state is generally difficult to find. A lot of heuristics for
these problems have been proposed, and one promising approach is to use
continuous variables. In recent years, one such algorithm has been implemented
by using parametric oscillators known as coherent Ising machines. Although
these algorithms have been confirmed to have high performance through many
experiments, unlike other familiar algorithms such as simulated annealing,
their computational ability has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we
propose a simple heuristic based on continuous variables whose static and
dynamical properties are easy to investigate. Through the analyses of the
proposed algorithm, we find that many local minima in the early stage of the
optimization and bifurcation delay reduce its performance in a certain class of

sequence of augmentation operations, which are still pre-defined and restricted
to limited options. In this paper, we show that a prior-free autonomous data
augmentation's objective can be derived from a representation learning
principle that aims to preserve the minimum sufficient information of the
labels. Given an example, the objective aims at creating a distant ""hard
positive example"" as the augmentation, while still preserving the original
label. We then propose a practical surrogate to the objective that can be
optimized efficiently and integrated seamlessly into existing methods for a
broad class of machine learning tasks, e.g., supervised, semi-supervised, and
noisy-label learning. Unlike previous works, our method does not require
training an extra generative model but instead leverages the intermediate layer
representations of the end-task model for generating data augmentations. In
experiments, we show that our method consistently brings non-trivial
improvements to the three aforementioned learning tasks from both efficiency

  Verification","13 pages, 9 figures",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although the security of automatic speaker verification (ASV) is seriously
threatened by recently emerged adversarial attacks, there have been some
countermeasures to alleviate the threat. However, many defense approaches not
only require the prior knowledge of the attackers but also possess weak
interpretability. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an
attacker-independent and interpretable method, named learnable mask detector
(LMD), to separate adversarial examples from the genuine ones. It utilizes
score variation as an indicator to detect adversarial examples, where the score
variation is the absolute discrepancy between the ASV scores of an original
audio recording and its transformed audio synthesized from its masked complex
spectrogram. A core component of the score variation detector is to generate
the masked spectrogram by a neural network. The neural network needs only
genuine examples for training, which makes it an attacker-independent approach.
Its interpretability lies that the neural network is trained to minimize the
score variation of the targeted ASV, and maximize the number of the masked
spectrogram bins of the genuine training examples. Its foundation is based on
the observation that, masking out the vast majority of the spectrogram bins
with little speaker information will inevitably introduce a large score
variation to the adversarial example, and a small score variation to the
genuine example. Experimental results with 12 attackers and two representative
ASV systems show that our proposed method outperforms five state-of-the-art
baselines. The extensive experimental results can also be a benchmark for the
detection-based ASV defenses.

intuitively assigned to the object that overlaps it the most. The assigned
label to each anchor will directly determine the optimization direction of the
corresponding prediction box, including the direction of box regression and
category prediction. In our practice of crowded object detection, however, the
results show that a positive anchor does not always regress toward the object
that overlaps it the most when multiple objects overlap. We name it anchor
drift. The anchor drift reflects that the anchor-object matching relation,
which is determined by the degree of overlap between anchors and objects, is
not always optimal. Conflicts between the fixed matching relation and learned
experience in the past training process may cause ambiguous predictions and
thus raise the false-positive rate. In this paper, a simple but efficient
adaptive two-stage anchor assignment (TSAA) method is proposed. It utilizes the
final prediction boxes rather than the fixed anchors to calculate the overlap
degree with objects to determine which object to regress for each anchor. The
participation of the prediction box makes the anchor-object assignment
mechanism adaptive. Extensive experiments are conducted on three classic
detectors RetinaNet, Faster-RCNN and YOLOv3 on CrowdHuman and COCO to evaluate
the effectiveness of TSAA. The results show that TSAA can significantly improve
the detectors' performance without additional computational costs or network

Existing deep learning-based VAD methods usually leverage proxy tasks to learn

spatial-temporal correlations among video frames, which is critical for
understanding normal patterns. In this paper, we address unsupervised VAD by
learning the evolution regularity of appearance and motion in the long and

the spatiotemporal long short-term memory (ST-LSTM) to extract and memorize
spatial appearances and temporal variations in a unified memory cell. In
addition, inspired by the generative adversarial network, we introduce a
discriminator to perform adversarial learning with the ST-LSTM to enhance the

the effectiveness of spatial-temporal correlations for unsupervised VAD. Our

the latter aims to compensate the lost spatio-temporal details in the Frame
Condensing stage. By this means, FrameMaker enables a remarkable reduction in

Moreover, the existing methods mainly utilize the property of the image or rain

exclusive relationship. To solve above dilemma, we explore the intrinsic
intra-similarity within each layer and inter-exclusiveness between two layers
and propose an unsupervised non-local contrastive learning (NLCL) deraining
method. The non-local self-similarity image patches as the positives are
tightly pulled together, rain patches as the negatives are remarkably pushed
away, and vice versa. On one hand, the intrinsic self-similarity knowledge
within positive/negative samples of each layer benefits us to discover more
compact representation; on the other hand, the mutually exclusive property
between the two layers enriches the discriminative decomposition. Thus, the
internal self-similarity within each layer (similarity) and the external
exclusive relationship of the two layers (dissimilarity) serving as a generic
image prior jointly facilitate us to unsupervisedly differentiate the rain from
clean image. We further discover that the intrinsic dimension of the non-local
image patches is generally higher than that of the rain patches. This motivates
us to design an asymmetric contrastive loss to precisely model the compactness
discrepancy of the two layers for better discriminative decomposition. In

in SPDC such that localized polarization Bell states can be generated,
regardless of the global incoherence over the full transverse plane. In our
experiment, we characterize the degree of LED light-induced polarization
entanglement in the standard framework of the violation of Bell inequality. We
have achieved the Bell value $S=2.33\pm 0.097$, obviously surpassing the
classical bound $S=2$ and thus witnessing the quantum entanglement. Our work
can be extended to prepare polarization entanglement by using other natural
light sources, such as sunlight and bio-light, which holds promise for
electricity-free quantum communications in outer space.

  Formulation Approach",,,,,"math.OC cs.CE cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new approach for formulating the delivery problem by
drones with general energy consumption models where the drones visit a set of
places to deliver parcels to customers. Drones can perform multiple trips that
start and end at a central depot while visiting several customers along their
paths. The problem determines the routing and scheduling decisions of the
drones in order to minimize the total transportation cost of serving customers.
For the first time, the new formulation approach enables us to use the best
available energy consumption model without the need of any extra
approximations. Though the approach works in a very general setting including
non-convex energy consumption models, it is also computationally efficient as
the resulting optimization model has a linear relaxation. A numerical study on
255 benchmark instances with up to 50 customers and a specific energy function
indicate that all the instances can be solved 20 times faster on average using
the new formulation when compared to the best existing branch-and-cut
algorithm. All the 15 benchmark instances with 50 customers are solved exactly,
whereas none of them has been solved optimally before. Moreover, new instances
with up to 150 customers are solved with small error bounds within a few hours.
The new approach can be simply applied to consider the extra energy required
when a drone needs to continue hovering until opening the delivery time window.
It can also be applied to the case where the flight time is dependent on the
drone's payload weight. Owing to the flexibility of the new approach, these
challenging extensions are formulated as linear optimization models for the
first time.

increase becomes less pronounced with increasing Se concentration indicating a
loss of insulating behavior. Interestingly, the moderately Se-substituted
samples exhibit metallic behavior in the high-temperature region and a weak
increase in the resistivity in the low-temperature regions, which indicates the
existence of carrier localization. The heavily Se-substituted compounds show
metallic behavior in the entire-temperature region. Sign changes of the Hall
coefficients are observed for the x = 0.2 samples, which possibly is related to
a charge-density wave (CDW). Magnetoresistance measurements indicate that WAL
is realized in the heavily Se-substituted systems. The WAL behavior is weakened
by the changes in F and Se concentrations. A crossover state of the WAL and WL
emerges around the moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The change of
the resistivity behavior by the F and Se substitution clearly correlates to the
difference of the magnetoconductance. Moreover, the localization regions of the
WAL-WL crossover and weak WAL states are possibly associated with the CDW. We
propose that the BiCh2-based system is a good platform for studying
relationship between WAL, superconductivity, and electronic ordering because
those states are tunable by element substitutions with bulk single crystals.

improving the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
This paper takes advantage of this additional DoF to alleviate practical issues
of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in rate-splitting multiple access
(RSMA) schemes. Specifically, we propose three dual-polarized downlink
transmission approaches for a massive MIMO-RSMA network under the effects of
polarization interference and residual errors of imperfect SIC. The first
approach implements polarization multiplexing for transmitting the users' data
messages, which removes the need to execute SIC in the reception. The second
approach transmits replicas of users' messages in the two polarizations, which
enables users to exploit diversity through the polarization domain. The third
approach, in its turn, employs the original SIC-based RSMA technique per
polarization, and this allows the BS to transmit two independent superimposed
data streams simultaneously. An in-depth theoretical analysis is carried out,
in which we derive tight closed-form approximations for the outage
probabilities of the three proposed approaches. Accurate approximations for the
ergodic sum-rates of the two first schemes are also derived. Simulation results
validate the theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
schemes. For instance, under low to moderate cross-polar interference, the
results show that, even under high levels of residual SIC error, our
dual-polarized MIMO-RSMA strategies outperform the conventional
single-polarized MIMO-RSMA counterpart. It is also shown that the performance
of all RSMA schemes is impressively higher than that of single and

inability to deal with the spatial long-range effects caused by illumination
degradation. To alleviate such limitations, we propose a LLSIE model termed
Decoupled Cross-scale Cross-view Interaction Network (DCI-Net). Specifically,
we present a decoupled interaction module (DIM) that aims for sufficient
dual-view information interaction. DIM decouples the dual-view information
exchange into discovering multi-scale cross-view correlations and further
exploring cross-scale information flow. Besides, we present a spatial-channel

refinement that enhances information flow in channel dimension. Extensive

this ion channel can potentially lead fatal disorder and/or long QT syndrome.
Many drugs have been withdrawn because of their serious hERG-cardiotoxicity. It
is crucial to assess the hERG blockade activity in the early stage of drug
discovery. We are particularly interested in the hERG-cardiotoxicity of
compounds collected in the DrugBank database considering that many DrugBank
compounds have been approved for therapeutic treatments or have high potential
to become drugs. Machine learning-based in silico tools offer a rapid and
economical platform to virtually screen DrugBank compounds. We design accurate
and robust classifiers for blockers/non-blockers and then build regressors to
quantitatively analyze the binding potency of the DrugBank compounds on the
hERG channel. Molecular sequences are embedded with two natural language
processing (NPL) methods, namely, autoencoder and transformer. Complementary
three-dimensional (3D) molecular structures are embedded with two advanced
mathematical approaches, i.e., topological Laplacians and algebraic graphs.
With our state-of-the-art tools, we reveal that 227 out of the 8641 DrugBank
compounds are potential hERG blockers, suggesting serious drug safety problems.
Our predictions provide guidance for the further experimental interrogation of
DrugBank compounds' hERG-cardiotoxicity .

any off-the-shelf Offline RL algorithm. Theoretically, we prove that BPR
carries out performance guarantees when integrated into algorithms that have
either policy improvement guarantees (conservative algorithms) or produce lower

BPR combined with existing state-of-the-art Offline RL algorithms leads to

minimize a (possibly nonconvex) quadratic function is equivalent to running the
Power Method (PM) on the gradients. The connection between GD with a fixed step
size and the PM, both with and without fixed momentum, is thus established.
Consequently, valuable eigen-information is available via GD.
  Recent examples show that GD with a fixed step size, applied to locally
quadratic nonconvex functions, can take exponential time to escape saddle
points (Simon S. Du, Chi Jin, Jason D. Lee, Michael I. Jordan, Aarti Singh, and
Barnabas Poczos: ""Gradient descent can take exponential time to escape saddle

examples are revisited and it is shown that eigenvalue information was missing,
so that the examples may not provide a complete picture of the potential
practical behaviour of GD. Thus, ongoing investigation of the behaviour of GD
on nonconvex functions, possibly with an \emph{adaptive} or \emph{variable}
step size, is warranted.
  It is shown that, in the special case of a quadratic in $R^2$, if an
eigenvalue is known, then GD with a fixed step size will converge in two
iterations, and a complete eigen-decomposition is available.
  By considering the dynamics of the gradients and iterates, new step size
strategies are proposed to improve the practical performance of GD. Several
numerical examples are presented, which demonstrate the advantages of
exploiting the GD--PM connection.

performance. However, the impact of the syndication network is overlooked.
Syndication network has a great influence on the propagation of information and
trust. By exploiting an authoritative VC dataset of thirty-five-year investment
information in China, we construct a joint-investment network of VC firms and
analyse the effects of syndication and diversification on specialisation and
investment performance. There is a clear correlation between the syndication
network degree and specialisation level of VC firms, which implies that the
well-connected VC firms are diversified. More connections generally bring about
more information or other resources, and VC firms are more likely to enter a
new stage or industry with some new co-investing VC firms when compared to a
randomised null model. Moreover, autocorrelation analysis of both
specialisation and success rate on the syndication network indicates that
clustering of similar VC firms is roughly limited to the secondary
neighbourhood. When analysing local clustering patterns, we discover that,
contrary to popular beliefs, there is no apparent successful club of investors.
In contrast, investors with low success rates are more likely to cluster. Our
discoveries enrich the understanding of VC investment behaviours and can assist

spreading (i.e., backward contact tracing), as has been used in Japan and
Australia, has proven crucial as going backwards can pick up infections that
might otherwise be missed at superspreading events. How should robust backward
contact tracing automated by mobile computing and network analytics be
designed? In this paper, we formulate the forward and backward contact tracing
problem for epidemic source inference as maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation
subject to subgraph sampling. Besides its restricted case (inspired by the
seminal work of Zaman and Shah in 2011) when the full infection topology is

  contribute equally",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Syntactically controlled paraphrase generation has become an emerging
research direction in recent years. Most existing approaches require annotated
paraphrase pairs for training and are thus costly to extend to new domains.
Unsupervised approaches, on the other hand, do not need paraphrase pairs but
suffer from relatively poor performance in terms of syntactic control and
quality of generated paraphrases. In this paper, we demonstrate that leveraging
Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) can greatly improve the performance of
unsupervised syntactically controlled paraphrase generation. Our proposed
model, AMR-enhanced Paraphrase Generator (AMRPG), separately encodes the AMR
graph and the constituency parse of the input sentence into two disentangled
semantic and syntactic embeddings. A decoder is then learned to reconstruct the
input sentence from the semantic and syntactic embeddings. Our experiments show
that AMRPG generates more accurate syntactically controlled paraphrases, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to the existing unsupervised
approaches. We also demonstrate that the paraphrases generated by AMRPG can be
used for data augmentation to improve the robustness of NLP models.

as supervised approaches. However, learning unknown types of anomalies using an
unsupervised approach is more practical than a supervised approach as
annotation is an extra burden. In this paper, we use isolation tree-based
unsupervised clustering to partition the deep feature space of the video
segments. The RGB- stream generates a pseudo anomaly score and the flow stream
generates a pseudo dynamicity score of a video segment. These scores are then
fused using a majority voting scheme to generate preliminary bags of positive
and negative segments. However, these bags may not be accurate as the scores
are generated only using the current segment which does not represent the
global behavior of a typical anomalous event. We then use a refinement strategy
based on a cross-branch feed-forward network designed using a popular I3D
network to refine both scores. The bags are then refined through a segment
re-mapping strategy. The intuition of adding the dynamicity score of a segment
with the anomaly score is to enhance the quality of the evidence. The method
has been evaluated on three popular video anomaly datasets, i.e., UCF-Crime,
CCTV-Fights, and UBI-Fights. Experimental results reveal that the proposed
framework achieves competitive accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art
video anomaly detection methods.

oocytes undergo two sequential cell divisions. During each division, a large,
long-lived, microtubule-based organelle called the meiotic spindle assembles
around condensed chromosomes. Although meiotic spindles have been intensively
studied for several decades, as force-generating mechanical objects, they
remain very poorly understood. In materials physics, coarse-grained theories
have been essential in understanding the large-scale behavior of systems
composed of many interacting particles. It is unclear, however, if this
approach can succeed in capturing the properties of active, biochemically
complex, living materials like the spindle. Here, we show that a class of
models based on nematic liquid crystal theory can describe important aspects of
the organelle-scale structure and dynamics of spindles in living mouse oocytes.
Using our models to interpret quantitative polarization microscopy data, we
measure for the first time material properties relating to stress propagation
in living oocytes, including the nematic diffusivities corresponding to splay
and bend deformations. Unlike the reconstituted amphibian spindles that were
previously studied in vitro, nematic elastic stress is exponentially screened
in the microtubule network of living mammalian oocytes, with a screening length
of order one micron. This observation can be explained by the relatively high
volume fraction of embedded chromosomes in mammalian meiotic spindles, which
cause long voids in the microtubule network and so disrupt orientational stress
propagation.

In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the contributions of

baseline of confidence summation and demonstrate the necessity of exploiting
the complementary property of different distance metrics. By finding the

Metrics Module (AMM) to decouple metrics fusion into metric-prediction fusion
and metric-losses fusion. The former encourages mutual complementary, while the
latter alleviates metric competition via multi-task collaborative learning.
Based on AMM, we design a few-shot classification framework AMTNet, including
the AMM and the Global Adaptive Loss (GAL), to jointly optimize the few-shot

robust. In the experiment, the proposed AMM achieves 2% higher performance than

control light-matter interactions, and it is thus fundamental to basic science
and practical applications. General design approaches rely on the manipulation
of bulk properties of superstrate or substrate and on the modification of
boundary geometries. Due to the recent advent of metasurfaces and
low-dimensional materials, the boundary can be flexibly featured with a surface
conductivity, which can be rather complex but provide an extra degree of
freedom to regulate the propagation of light. In this perspective, we denote
the boundary with a non-zero surface conductivity as the meta-boundary. The
meta-boundaries are categorized into four types, namely isotropic, anisotropic,
biisotropic and bianisotropic meta-boundaries, according to the electromagnetic
boundary conditions. Accordingly, the latest development for these four kinds
of meta-boundaries are reviewed. Finally, an outlook on the research tendency
of meta-boundaries is provided, particularly on the manipulation of

in D-dimensional $AdS$ spacetime. Here, the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$),
Newton's gravitational constant ($G$) and the Gauss-Bonnet parameter ($\alpha$)
are varied in the bulk, and a mixed first law is rewritten considering central
charge ($C$) (of dual boundary conformal theory) and its conjugate variable
utilising the gauge-gravity duality. A novel universal nature of central charge
near the critical point of black hole phase transition in Einstein's gravity
has been observed in \cite{mann1}. We observe that this universal nature breaks
when such phase transition is considered for black holes in the Gauss-Bonnet
gravity. Apart from this, treating the Gauss-Bonnet parameter as a
thermodynamic variable as suggested in \cite{kastori} in light of the
consistency between first law and the Smarr relation leads to modified
thermodynamic volume (conjugate to variable cosmological constant), adding to a
new understanding of the Van der Waals gas like behaviour of the black holes in
higher dimensional and higher curvature gravity theories. Our analysis
considers a general $D$ dimensional background. We have then imposed a greater
focus in the analysis of the phase structure of the five dimensional
Gauss-Bonnet spacetime. Our analysis also shows that the general universal
nature of the critical value of the central charge (which was present in four
dimensional $AdS$ spacetime), breaks down in case of five dimensional $AdS$
spacetime even in the absence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity. This finding indicates
the universal nature of the central charge may be a special feature of the four
dimensional $AdS$ spacetime only.

sources with G magnitudes up to 20 mag. Candidate selection is based on the
results of variable object classification performed within the Gaia Data
Processing and Analysis Consortium, further filtered using eclipsing
binary-tailored criteria based on the G light curves. To find the orbital
period, a large ensemble of trial periods is first acquired using three
distinct period search methods applied to the cleaned G light curve. The G
light curve is then modelled with up-to two Gaussians and a cosine for each
trial period. The best combination of orbital period and geometric model is
finally selected using Bayesian model comparison based on the BIC. A global
ranking metric is provided to rank the quality of the chosen model between
sources. The catalogue is restricted to orbital periods larger than 0.2 days.
About 530,000 of the candidates are classified as eclipsing binaries in the
literature as well, out of ~600,000 available crossmatches, and 93% of them
have published periods compatible with the Gaia periods. Catalogue completeness
is estimated to be between 25% and 50%, depending on the sky region, relative
to the OGLE4 catalogues of eclipsing binaries towards the Galactic Bulge and
the Magellanic Clouds. The analysis of an illustrative sample of ~400,000

set emission goals, since it allows an efficient supply of heat while using the
advantages of sector coupling between different energy carriers such as power,
heat, gas and biomass. Most district heating systems use several different
types of units to produce heat for hundreds or thousands of households. The
technologies reach from natural gas-fired and electric boilers to biomass-fired
units as well as waste heat from industrial processes and solar thermal units.
Furthermore, combined heat and power units (CHP) units are often included to
use the synergy effects of excess heat from electricity production.
  We propose a generic mathematical formulation for the operational production
optimization in district heating systems. The generality of the model allows it
to be used for most district heating systems although they might use different
combinations of technologies in different system layouts. The mathematical
formulation is based on stochastic programming to account for the uncertainty
of production from non-dispatchable units such as waste heat and solar heat.
Furthermore, the model is easily adaptable to different application cases in
district heating such as operational planning, bidding to electricity markets
and long-term evaluation. We present results from three real cases in Denmark

waves traverse a pulsar magnetosphere, a portion of the gravitational radiation
is transformed into electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The observed properties of
FRBs are consistent with the properties of this EM radiation, implying,
remarkably, that the GZ effect can account for both repeating and non-repeating
FRBs. If this model is correct, the pulsar's properties should not change over
time, and it would continue to emit both EM dipole and gravitational quadrupole
radiation for a long period of time. This article targets the gravitational
radiation produced by the pulsar mechanism and shows that several proposed
gravitational wave detectors can detect these gravitational waves. If such
detections are performed in the future from the location of FRBs, it might
validate the GZ process for FRB production and potentially rule out several

characterize the growth functions of finitely generated algebras (equivalently,
semigroups, or hereditary languages).
  The growth function of every finitely generated, infinite-dimensional algebra
is increasing and submultiplicative. The question of to what extent these
natural necessary conditions are also sufficient -- and in particular, whether
they are sufficient at least for sufficiently rapid functions -- was posed and
studied by various authors and has attracted a flurry of research.
  While every increasing and submultiplicative function is realizable as a
growth function up to a linear error term, we show that there exist arbitrarily
rapid increasing submultiplicative functions which are not equivalent to the
growth of any algebra, thus resolving the aforementioned problem and settling a
question posed by Zelmanov (and repeated by Alahmadi-Alsulami-Jain-Zelmanov).
These can be interpreted as `holes' in the space of growth functions,
accumulating to exponential functions in the order topology.
  We show that there exist monomial algebras and hereditary languages whose
growth functions encode the existence of non-prolongable words, and algebras
whose growth functions encode the existence of nilpotent ideals (in the graded
case). This negatively solves another conjecture of

interior microscale architecture of syntactic foams with matrix segregation
achieved through the selective laser sintering - additive manufacturing
process. This manifests as paradoxical macroscale mechanical responses. GMBs
with a diameter larger than the gaps between the segregated matrix's cell walls
get lodged between and in the cell walls, whereas those with a diameter smaller
than the gaps are likely to get lodged inside the cell walls. As a result,
larger particles contribute significantly to the stiffness of syntactic foams,
whereas smaller particles have a relatively negligible effect. Larger particles
with lower crushing strength lowered the densification stress of the foam. In
contrast, the foam with smaller particles with higher crushing strength behaved
similarly to pure TPU but with substantially less weight. Overall, we show that
combining reinforcement parameters with print parameters enables the design and
fabrication of hierarchical customized structures and functional features in 3D
printed syntactic foams. These findings can be applied to create and design
lightweight sandwich structure cores for marine and aerospace applications.

reveals incompatibilities of the event with known behaviour of real waves,
leading us to conclude that it was not a real wave event. Wave events similar

on predicting the object pose without associated uncertainty under occlusion

information about shape attributes, and this condition is hardly satisfied in
reality; even asymmetric objects may be symmetric under the viewpoint change.
In addition, acquiring and fusing diverse sensor data is challenging when
extending them to robotics applications. Tackling these limitations, we present
an ambiguity-aware 6D object pose estimation network, PrimA6D++, as a generic
uncertainty prediction method. The major challenges in pose estimation, such as
occlusion and symmetry, can be handled in a generic manner based on the
measured ambiguity of the prediction. Specifically, we devise a network to
reconstruct the three rotation axis primitive images of a target object and
predict the underlying uncertainty along each primitive axis. Leveraging the
estimated uncertainty, we then optimize multi-object poses using visual
measurements and camera poses by treating it as an object SLAM problem. The
proposed method shows a significant performance improvement in T-LESS and
YCB-Video datasets. We further demonstrate real-time scene recognition

operators, we prove a uniqueness result, i.e. we prove that a Hankel operator
from our class is uniquely determined by the spectral data. In other words, the
spectral map, which maps a Hankel operator to the spectral data, is injective.
Further, in contrast to the compact case, we prove the failure of surjectivity
of the spectral map, i.e. we prove that not all spectral data from a certain
natural set correspond to Hankel operators. We make some progress in describing
the image of the spectral map. We also give applications to the cubic Szeg\H{o}
equation. In particular, we prove that not all solutions with initial data in
BMOA are almost periodic; this is in a sharp contrast to the known result for
initial data in VMOA.

transfer in multi-speaker multi-style text-to-speech (TTS) scenarios. With the
disentanglement of timbres and styles, TTS systems could synthesize expressive
speech for a given speaker with any style which has been seen in the training
corpus. However, there are still some shortcomings with the current research on
timbre and style disentanglement. The current method either requires
single-speaker multi-style recordings, which are difficult and expensive to
collect, or uses a complex network and complicated training method, which is
difficult to reproduce and control the style transfer behavior. To improve the
disentanglement effectiveness of timbres and styles, and to remove the reliance
on single-speaker multi-style corpus, a simple but effective timbre and style
disentanglement method is proposed in this paper. The FastSpeech2 network is
employed as the backbone network, with explicit duration, pitch, and energy
trajectory to represent the style. Each speaker's data is considered as a
separate and isolated style, then a speaker embedding and a style embedding are
added to the FastSpeech2 network to learn disentangled representations.
Utterance level pitch and energy normalization are utilized to improve the
decoupling effect. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
could synthesize speech with any style seen during training with high style
similarity while maintaining very high speaker similarity.

gradient descent (SGD) exhibit informativeness and in some cases advantage over
the commonly adopted mean-square error-based ones. In this work we provide a
formal framework for the study of general high probability bounds with SGD,
based on the theory of large deviations. The framework allows for a generic
(not-necessarily bounded) gradient noise satisfying mild technical assumptions,
allowing for the dependence of the noise distribution on the current iterate.
Under the preceding assumptions, we find an upper large deviations bound for
SGD with strongly convex functions. The corresponding rate function captures
analytical dependence on the noise distribution and other problem parameters.
This is in contrast with conventional mean-square error analysis that captures
only the noise dependence through the variance and does not capture the effect
of higher order moments nor interplay between the noise geometry and the shape
of the cost function. We also derive exact large deviation rates for the case
when the objective function is quadratic and show that the obtained function
matches the one from the general upper bound hence showing the tightness of the
general upper bound. Numerical examples illustrate and corroborate theoretical
findings.

networks continue to operate even if a single line fails. Modeling $\mathcal{N}

constraints if all possible outages are accounted for, which leads to a high
computational burden. Typical approaches to avoid this burden consider only a
subset of possible outages relevant to a given dispatch situation. However,
this relies on knowing the dispatch situation beforehand, and it is not
suitable for investment optimization problems where the generation fleet is not
known in advance. In this paper, we introduce a heuristic approach to model the
fully secured $\mathcal{N}-1$ feasible space using a smaller number of
constraints in a way that only depends on the topology of transmission
networks. In our proposed approach, the network's security is modelled by
comparing the polytope of the feasible space of nodal net power obtained from
the security-constrained linearized AC optimal power flow problem. To
approximate this polytope, a buffer capacity factor is defined for transmission
lines in the $\mathcal{N}-0$ secure case, thereby avoiding the introduction of
many additional constraints. In this way, three approaches are introduced for
obtaining a buffer capacity factor consisting of approximate, robust and
line-specific approaches. Finally, the performance of our proposed approaches
is assessed in different scales of transmission networks for determining the
proposed buffer capacity factors, contingency analysis and economic evaluation.
Moreover, we find that our proposed heuristics provide excellent approximations
of the fully secured $\mathcal{N}-1$ solutions with a much lower computational

handful of objects. This is in part due to the requirement of good
signal-to-noise X-ray spectra covering a wide range of energies. We present
here results on the X-ray spectral analysis of 18 Seyferts, having more than
one epoch of observations to look for variation in $\rm{kT_e}$. The data for a
total of 52 epochs on these 18 AGN were taken from observations carried out by
NuSTAR in the 3$-$79 keV energy band. From phenomenological and physical model
fits to the multi-epoch data on these 18 sources from {\it NuSTAR}, we could
constrain the cut-off energy ($E_{cut}$) in a large fraction of the sources.
Also, from Comptonized model fits, we could obtain $\rm{kT_e}$ for our sample.
Of the 18 sources, at the 90 per cent confidence level, evidence for variation
in $\rm{kT_e}$ was found for only one source, namely MCG+08-11-011. For this
source, between two epochs, separated by about five years, we found $\rm{kT_e}$
to decrease from 57$^{+29}_{-16}$ keV to 30$^{+11}_{-7}$ keV. During the same
period, the flux decreased from (12.60 to 14.02) $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the optical depth increased from 1.68 to 2.73. We thus
found a positive correlation between flux and coronal temperature with a
reduction of about 40 per cent in optical depth. Our observations tend to
favour the vertically outflowing corona scenario for the observed variation in
$\rm{kT_e}$ in MCG+08-11-011.

problem with plenty of applications -- including data summarization, influence

find a solution that maximizes the average utility over all users, for each of
whom the utility is defined by a monotone submodular function. However, when
the population of users is composed of several demographic groups, another
critical problem is whether the utility is fairly distributed across different
groups. Although the \emph{utility} and \emph{fairness} objectives are both
desirable, they might contradict each other, and, to the best of our knowledge,
little attention has been paid to optimizing them jointly.
  In this paper, we propose a new problem called \emph{Bicriteria Submodular
Maximization} (BSM) to strike a balance between utility and fairness.
Specifically, it requires finding a fixed-size solution to maximize the utility
function, subject to the value of the fairness function not being below a
threshold. Since BSM is inapproximable within any constant factor in general,
we turn our attention to designing instance-dependent approximation schemes.
Our algorithmic proposal comprises two methods, with different approximation
factors, obtained by converting a BSM instance into other submodular
optimization problem instances. Using real-world and synthetic datasets, we
showcase applications of our methods in three submodular maximization problems:
maximum coverage, influence maximization, and facility location.

the form of extensive collections of facts about real-world entities, their

systems that exploit structured information such as in tasks like structured
search, question answering and reasoning, and hence their data quality becomes
paramount. The inevitability of change in the real-world, brings us to a
central property of KBs -- they are highly dynamic in that the information they
contain are constantly subject to change. In other words, KBs are unstable.
  In this paper, we investigate the notion of KB stability, specifically, the
problem of KBs changing due to real-world change. Some entity-property-pairs do
not undergo change in reality anymore (e.g., Einstein-children or
Tesla-founders), while others might well change in the future (e.g.,
Tesla-board member or Ronaldo-occupation as of 2022). This notion of real-world
grounded change is different from other changes that affect the data only,
notably correction and delayed insertion, which have received attention in data
cleaning, vandalism detection, and completeness estimation already. To analyze
KB stability, we proceed in three steps. (1) We present heuristics to delineate
changes due to world evolution from delayed completions and corrections, and
use these to study the real-world evolution behaviour of diverse Wikidata
domains, finding a high skew in terms of properties. (2) We evaluate heuristics
to identify entities and properties likely to not change due to real-world
change, and filter inherently stable entities and properties. (3) We evaluate
the possibility of predicting stability post-hoc, specifically predicting
change in a property of an entity, finding that this is possible with up to 83%
F1 score, on a balanced binary stability prediction task.

is essential to the naturalness of synthesized sound, due to the inherent

introduced in this paper to control the vibrato's likeliness, rate, depth and
phase in singing, where the vibrato likeliness represents the existence
probability of vibrato and it would help improve the singing voice's
naturalness. Actually, there is no annotated label about vibrato likeliness in
existing singing corpus. We adopt a novel vibrato likeliness labeling method to
label the vibrato likeliness automatically. Meanwhile, the power spectrogram of
audio contains rich information that can improve the expressiveness of singing.

expressive singing voice synthesis. Experimental results on the open dataset

ballistic electron transport in moir\'e superlattices in highly aligned

predict that a high-quality graphene bilayer aligned with an hBN substrate
features $T^2$-dependent resistivity caused by umklapp electron-electron (Uee)
scattering from the moir\'e superlattice, that is, a momentum kick by Bragg
scattering experienced by a pair of electrons. Substantial Uee scattering
appears upon $p$-doping of the bilayer above a threshold density, which depends
on the twist angle between graphene and hBN, and its contribution towards the
resistivity grows rapidly with hole density until it reaches a peak value,
whose amplitude changes non-monotonically with the superlattice period. We also
analyse the influence of an electrostatically induced bandgap in the bilayer
and trigonal warping it enhances in the electron dispersion on the
electron-electron umklapp scattering.

equations of motion, and additionally, the system is characterized by
long-range interactions. A concrete example is that of particles interacting
with light as encountered in free-electron laser and cold-atom experiments. In
this work, we study the relaxation dynamics to non-Hamiltonian systems, more
precisely, to systems with interactions of both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian
origin. Our model consists of $N$ globally-coupled particles moving on a circle
of unit radius; the model is one-dimensional. We show that in the infinite-size
limit, the dynamics, similarly to the Hamiltonian case, is described by the
Vlasov equation. In the Hamiltonian case, the system eventually reaches an
equilibrium state, even though one has to wait for a long time diverging with
$N$ for this to happen. By contrast, in the non-Hamiltonian case, there is no
equilibrium state that the system is expected to reach eventually. We
characterize this state with its average magnetization. We find that the
relaxation dynamics depends strongly on the relative weight of the Hamiltonian
and non-Hamiltonian contributions to the interaction. When the non-Hamiltonian
part is predominant, the magnetization attains a vanishing value, suggesting
that the system does not sustain states with constant magnetization, either
stationary or rotating. On the other hand, when the Hamiltonian part is
predominant, the magnetization presents long-lived strong oscillations, for
which we provide a heuristic explanation. Furthermore, we find that the
finite-size corrections are much more pronounced than those in the Hamiltonian
case; we justify this by showing that the Lenard-Balescu equation, which gives
leading-order corrections to the Vlasov equation, does not vanish, contrary to
what occurs in one-dimensional Hamiltonian long-range systems.

construct a multi-moment fluid model with an implicit fluid closure included in

trained with a small fraction of sparsely sampled data from kinetic simulations
of Landau damping, using the physics-informed neural network (PINN) and the
gradient-enhanced physics-informed neural network (gPINN). The multi-moment
fluid model constructed using either PINN or gPINN reproduces the time

plasma dynamics from the kinetic simulations. For the first time, we introduce
a new variant of the gPINN architecture, namely, gPINN$p$ to capture the Landau

residuals, gPINN$p$ only adds the gradient of the pressure equation residual as
one additional constraint. Among the three approaches, the gPINN$p$-constructed

in the last class of systems specific phonon excitations. In this overview we
concentrate first on the (semi)quantitative theory of high T$_{C}$
superconductivity in the cuprates based on our original vibrational approach
beyond the renormalized mean field theory. The model we explore mainly is
$t$-$J$-$U$ model containing both the superexchange (kinetic energy) combined
with strong interelectronic correlations. Selected equilibrium and
dynamic-excitation properties are analyzed briefly. General questions regarding
the pseudogap and two--dimensional character of those systems are raised.

implementing traffic signal control (TSC). However, most existing DRL methods
employ fixed control strategies, making traffic signal phase duration less
flexible. Additionally, the trend of using more complex DRL models makes
real-life deployment more challenging. To address these two challenges, we
firstly propose a two-stage DRL framework, named DynamicLight, which uses Max
Queue-Length to select the proper phase and employs a deep Q-learning network
to determine the duration of the corresponding phase. Based on the design of
DynamicLight, we also introduce two variants: (1) DynamicLight-Lite, which
addresses the first challenge by using only 19 parameters to achieve dynamic
phase duration settings; and (2) DynamicLight-Cycle, which tackles the second
challenge by actuating a set of phases in a fixed cyclical order to implement
flexible phase duration in the respective cyclical phase structure. Numerical
experiments are conducted using both real-world and synthetic datasets,
covering four most commonly adopted traffic signal intersections in real life.
Experimental results show that: (1) DynamicLight can learn satisfactorily on
determining the phase duration and achieve a new state-of-the-art, with
improvement up to 6% compared to the baselines in terms of adjusted average
travel time; (2) DynamicLight-Lite matches or outperforms most baseline methods
with only 19 parameters; and (3) DynamicLight-Cycle demonstrates high
performance for current TSC systems without remarkable modification in an
actual deployment. Our code is released at Github.

generate surface magnetic fields, which manifest as magnetic activity in the
form of starspots, faculae, flares, when their rotation period is shorter than
their convective turnover time. Most red giants, having undergone significant
spin down while expanding, have slow rotation and no spots. However, based on a
sample of about 4500 red giants observed by the NASA Kepler mission, a previous
study showed that about 8 % display spots, including about 15 % that belong to
close binary systems. Here, we shed light on a puzzling fact: for rotation
periods less than 80 days, a red giant that belongs to a close binary system
displays a photometric modulation about an order of magnitude larger than that
of a single red giant with similar rotational period and physical properties.
We investigate whether binarity leads to larger magnetic fields when tides lock
systems, or if a different spot distribution on single versus close binary
stars can explain this fact. For this, we measure the chromospheric emission in
the CaII H & K lines of 3130 of the 4465 stars studied in a previous work
thanks to the LAMOST survey. We show that red giants in a close-binary
configuration with spin-orbit resonance display significantly larger
chromospheric emission than single stars, suggesting that tidal locking leads
to larger magnetic fields at a fixed rotational period. Beyond bringing
interesting new observables to study the evolution of binary systems, this
result could be used to distinguish single versus binary red giants in
automatic pipelines based on machine learning.

along the transverse direction while they propagate forwards. Although these
properties could be associated with the beam coherence, it has been revealed
that they also manifest in the case of partially coherent Airy-type. Here,
these properties are further investigated by introducing and analyzing a class
of partially coherent Airy beams under both infinite and finite energy
conditions. The key element within the present approach is the so-called
cross-spectral density, which enables a direct connection with the quantum
density matrix, making the analysis exportable to the quantum realm to study
the dynamics of Airy wave packets acted by both incoherence and decoherence. As
it is shown, in the case of infinite energy beams both properties are preserved
even under the circumstance of total incoherence provided the underlying
structure of the beam remains equal to that of an Airy beam. In the case of
finite energy beams, a situation closer to a realistic scenario, as
experimental beams cannot have an infinite extension, it is shown that a
propagation range along which both properties are preserved can be warranted.
This is controlled by a critical distance, which depends on the spread range
determined by the parameters ruling the extension of random field spatial
fluctuations. Such a distance is determined by defining a position-dependent
parameter that quantifies the degree of overlapping between the propagated beam
and the input one displaced by an amount equivalent to the propagation
distance.

cyclotrons are often not valid or not precise for relativistic energies. The
main difficulty in developing such models lies in the fact that cross-terms
between derivatives of the average magnetic field and the azimuthally varying
components cannot be neglected at higher energies. Taking such cross-terms
rigorously into account results in an even larger number of terms that need to
be included in the equations. In this paper, a method is developed which is
relativistic correct and which provides results that are practical and easy to
use. We derive new formulas, graphs and tables for the radial and vertical
tunes in terms of the the flutter, its radial derivatives, the spiral angle and
the relativistic gamma. Using this method, we study the $2\nu_r=N$ structural
resonance ($N$ is number of sectors) and provide formulas and graphs for its
stopband. Combining those equations with the new equation for the verical tune,
we find the stability zone and the energy limit of compact isochronous
cyclotrons for any value of N. We confront the new analytical method with
closed orbit simulations of the IBA C400 cyclotron for hadron therapy.

$(e_n)_n$ for a Banach space $X$ is called $\mathcal{F}$-greedy if there is a
constant $C\geqslant 1$ such that for each $x\in X$, $m \in \mathbb{N}$, and
$G_m(x)$, we have $$\|x - G_m(x)\|\ \leqslant\ C \inf\left\{\left\|x-\sum_{n\in

$\mathbb{K}$ is the scalar field. From the definition, any $\mathcal{F}$-greedy
basis is quasi-greedy and so, the notion of being $\mathcal{F}$-greedy lies
between being greedy and being quasi-greedy. We characterize
$\mathcal{F}$-greedy bases as being $\mathcal{F}$-unconditional,
$\mathcal{F}$-disjoint democratic, and quasi-greedy, thus generalizing the
well-known characterization of greedy bases by Konyagin and Temlyakov. We also
prove a similar characterization for $\mathcal{F}$-almost greedy bases.
  Furthermore, we provide several examples of bases that are nontrivially
$\mathcal{F}$-greedy. For a countable ordinal $\alpha$, we consider the case
$\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{S}_\alpha$, where $\mathcal{S}_\alpha$ is the Schreier
family of order $\alpha$. We show that for each $\alpha$, there is a basis that

is obtained by choosing a random local rotation around each vertex. Under this
setup, the number of faces or the genus of the corresponding 2-cell embedding
becomes a random variable. Random embeddings of two particular graph classes --
those of a bouquet of $n$ loops and those of $n$ parallel edges connecting two
vertices -- have been extensively studied and are well-understood. However,
little is known about more general graphs despite their important connections
with central problems in mainstream mathematics and in theoretical physics (see
[Lando & Zvonkin, Springer 2004]). There are also tight connections with
problems in computing (random generation, approximation algorithms). The
results of this paper, in particular, explain why Monte Carlo methods (see,
e.g., [Gross & Tucker, Ann. NY Acad. Sci 1979] and [Gross & Rieper, JGT 1991])
cannot work for approximating the minimum genus of graphs.
  In his breakthrough work ([Stahl, JCTB 1991] and a series of other papers),
Stahl developed the foundation of ""random topological graph theory"". Most of
his results have been unsurpassed until today. In our work, we analyze the
expected number of faces of random embeddings (equivalently, the average genus)
of a graph $G$. It was very recently shown [Campion Loth & Mohar, arXiv 2022]
that for any graph $G$, the expected number of faces is at most linear. We show
that the actual expected number of faces is usually much smaller. In
particular, we prove the following results:
  1) $\frac{1}{2}\ln n - 2 < \mathbb{E}[F(K_n)] \le 3.65\ln n$, for $n$
sufficiently large. This greatly improves Stahl's $n+\ln n$ upper bound for
this case.
  2) For random models $B(n,\Delta)$ containing only graphs, whose maximum
degree is at most $\Delta$, we show that the expected number of faces is
$\Theta(\ln n)$.

choosing suitable non-uniform couplings, and our theorem implies the existence
of a stationary measure which does not at all look like a low-temperature Ising
Gibbs measure. The interesting aspect of our results lies in the fact that the

give rise to exotic collapse states when the defect charge exceeds a critical
value which is proportional to the Fermi velocity. In this work, we investigate
the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with charged
defects using tight-binding calculations. Like monolayer graphene, tBLG
exhibits linear bands near the Fermi level but with a dramatically reduced
Fermi velocity near the magic angle (approximately 1.1{\deg}). This suggests
that the critical value of the defect charge in magic-angle tBLG should also be
very small. We find that charged defects give rise to significant changes in
the low-energy electronic structure of tBLG. Depending on the defect position
in the moir\'e unit cell, it is possible to open a band gap or to induce an
additional flattening of the low-energy valence and conduction bands. Our
calculations suggest that the collapse states of the two monolayers hybridize
in the twisted bilayer. However, their in-plane localization remains largely
unaffected by the presence of the additional twisted layer because of the
different length scales of the moir\'e lattice and the monolayer collapse state
wavefunctions. These predictions can be tested in scanning tunnelling

Transit Survey (NGTS) as well as updated parameters for HATS-54b, which was
independently discovered by NGTS. NGTS-23b, NGTS-24b and NGTS-25b have orbital
periods of 4.076, 3.468, and 2.823 days and orbit G-, F- and K-type stars,
respectively. NGTS-24 and HATS-54 appear close to transitioning off the
main-sequence (if they are not already doing so), and therefore are interesting
targets given the observed lack of Hot Jupiters around sub-giant stars. By
considering the host star luminosities and the planets' small orbital
separations (0.037 - 0.050 au), we find that all four hot Jupiters are above
the minimum irradiance threshold for inflation mechanisms to be effective.
NGTS-23b has a mass of 0.61 $M_{J}$ and radius of 1.27 $R_{J}$ and is likely
inflated. With a radius of 1.21 $R_{J}$ and mass of 0.52 $M_{J}$, NGTS-24b has
a radius larger than expected from non-inflated models but its radius is
smaller than the predicted radius from current Bayesian inflationary models.
Finally, NGTS-25b is intermediate between the inflated and non-inflated cases,
having a mass of 0.64 $M_{J}$ and a radius of 1.02 $R_{J}$. The physical
processes driving radius inflation remain poorly understood, and by building
the sample of hot Jupiters we can aim to identify the additional controlling
parameters, such as metallicity and stellar age.

recognizers fusion method for CS ASR. It has two stages: the speech awareness
(SA) stage and the language fusion (LF) stage. In the SA stage, acoustic
features are mapped to two language-specific predictions by two independent
MAMs. To keep the MAMs focused on their own language, we further extend the
language-aware training strategy for the MAMs. In the LF stage, the BELM fuses
two language-specific predictions to get the final prediction. Moreover, we
propose a text simulation strategy to simplify the training process of the BELM
and reduce reliance on CS data. Experiments on a Mandarin-English corpus show
the efficiency of the proposed method. The mix error rate is significantly
reduced on the test set after using open-source pre-trained MAMs.

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies entirely from static
datasets, thereby avoiding the challenges associated with online data
collection. Practical applications of offline RL will inevitably require
learning from datasets where the variability of demonstrated behaviors changes
non-uniformly across the state space. For example, at a red light, nearly all
human drivers behave similarly by stopping, but when merging onto a highway,
some drivers merge quickly, efficiently, and safely, while many hesitate or
merge dangerously. Both theoretically and empirically, we show that typical
offline RL methods, which are based on distribution constraints fail to learn
from data with such non-uniform variability, due to the requirement to stay
close to the behavior policy to the same extent across the state space.
Ideally, the learned policy should be free to choose per state how closely to
follow the behavior policy to maximize long-term return, as long as the learned
policy stays within the support of the behavior policy. To instantiate this
principle, we reweight the data distribution in conservative Q-learning (CQL)
to obtain an approximate support constraint formulation. The reweighted
distribution is a mixture of the current policy and an additional policy
trained to mine poor actions that are likely under the behavior policy. Our
method, CQL (ReDS), is simple, theoretically motivated, and improves
performance across a wide range of offline RL problems in Atari games,
navigation, and pixel-based manipulation.

considerable, and ultimately manifests itself as miscalibration of predictions

instability at the model development stage and propose instability plots and

lengths $\mathbf{y}=(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)\in\mathbb{N}^n$ entering a one-way
street with $m=\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$ parking spots. The cars have parking
preferences $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\in[m]^n$, where
$[m]:=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$, and enter the street in order. Each car $i \in [n]$,
with length $y_i$ and preference $x_i$, follows a natural extension of the
classical parking rule: it begins looking for parking at its preferred spot
$x_i$ and parks in the first $y_i$ contiguously available spots thereafter, if
there are any. If all cars are able to park under the preference list
$\mathbf{x}$, we say $\mathbf{x}$ is a parking assortment for $\mathbf{y}$.
Parking assortments also generalize parking sequences, introduced by Ehrenborg
and Happ, since each car seeks for the first contiguously available spots it
fits in past its preference. Given a parking assortment $\mathbf{x}$ for
$\mathbf{y}$, we say it is permutation invariant if all rearrangements of
$\mathbf{x}$ are also parking assortments for $\mathbf{y}$. While all parking
functions are permutation invariant, this is not the case for parking
assortments in general, motivating the need for a characterization of this
property. Although obtaining a full characterization for arbitrary
$n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{N}^n$ remains elusive, we do so for
$n=2,3$. Given the technicality of these results, we introduce the notion of
minimally invariant car lengths, for which the only invariant parking
assortment is the all ones preference list. We provide a concise, oracle-based
characterization of minimally invariant car lengths for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
Our results around minimally invariant car lengths also hold for parking

for arbitrary graph states as representatives of the stabilizer states, and
show that the graph operations required for the calculation has a polynomial
scaling with the system size. As demonstrations, we compute the localized

ladder, and square structures. We also extend the calculation for graph states
subjected to single-qubit Markovian or non-Markovian Pauli noise on all qubits,
and demonstrate, for a specific lower bound of the localizable genuine
multiparty entanglement corresponding to a specific Pauli measurement setup,
the existence of a critical noise strength beyond which all of the post

large stabilizer states under noise due to the local unitary connection between
stabilizer states and graph states. We demonstrate this by considering a toric

marine research, making fast and reliable non-causal signal detection
paramount. Such detectors assist in reducing the amount of labor required for
signal annotations, which often contain large portions devoid of signals.
  Cetacean vocalization detection based on spectral entropy is investigated as
a means of vocalization discovery. Previous techniques using spectral entropy
(SE) mostly consider time-frequency enhancement of the entropy measure, and
utilize the STFT as its time-frequency (TF) decomposition. SE methods also
requires the user to set a detection threshold manually, which call for
knowledge of the produced entropy measures.
  This paper considers median filtering as a simple, effective way to provide
temporal stabilization to the entropy measure, and considers the CWT as an
alternative TF decomposition. K-means clustering is used to determine the
threshold required to accurately separate the signal/no-signal entropy
measures, resulting in a one-dimensional, two-class classification problem. The
class means are used to perform pseudo-probabilistic soft class assignment,
which is a useful metric in algorithmic development. The effect of median
filtering, signal-to-noise ratio and the chosen TF decomposition are
investigated.
  The proposed method shows a significant improvement in detection accuracy and
specificity, while also providing a more interpretable detection threshold
setting via soft class assignment.

sliding motion of a 3D viscoelastic block on a rigid substrate using the finite
element method (FEM). The macroscopic static friction coefficient decreases
with an increase in the external pressure, length, or width of the object,
which contradicts Amontons' law. Precursor slip occurs in the 2D interface
between the block and substrate before bulk sliding. The decrease in the
macroscopic static friction coefficient is scaled by the critical area of the
precursor slip before bulk sliding. A theoretical analysis of the simplified

under the null hypothesis, the databases are independent, and under the
alternate hypothesis, they are correlated, under an unknown row permutation. We
develop bounds on the type-I and type-II error probabilities, and show that the

recovers some partial alignment between the given databases. We also propose
two more algorithms: (i) One more algorithm for partial alignment recovery,

magnetospheric accretion in a T Tauri star to study the accretion and wind
structures in the close vicinity of the star. The gas accreting onto the star
consists of the gas from the magnetospheric boundary and the failed disk winds.
The accreting gas is commonly found as a multi-column accretion, which is
consistent with observations. A significant fraction of the angular momentum of
the accreting flows is removed by the magnetic fields of conical disk winds and
turbulent failed winds inside and near the magnetosphere. As a result, the
accretion torque is significantly reduced compared to the simple estimation
based on the mass accretion rate. The stellar spin affects the time variability
of the conical disk wind by changing the stability condition of the
magnetospheric boundary. However, the time-averaged magnetospheric radius only
weakly depends on the stellar spin, which is unlike the prediction of classical
theories that the stellar spin controls the magnetospheric radius through the
magnetic torque. The ratio of the toroidal to the poloidal field strengths at
the magnetospheric boundary, which is a key parameter for the magnetic torque,
is also insensitive to the spin; it is rather determined by the disk dynamics.
Considering newly found three-dimensional effects, we obtain a scaling relation
of the magnetospheric radius very similar to the Ghosh & Lamb relation from the
steady angular momentum transport equation.

been extensively investigated in the literature since then. These games are
played on a hypergraph where two players alternately select an unclaimed vertex
of it. In the Maker-Breaker convention, if Maker manages to fully take a
hyperedge, she wins, otherwise, Breaker is the winner. In the Maker-Maker
convention, the first player to take a hyperedge wins. In both cases, the game
stops as soon as Maker has taken a hyperedge. By definition, this family of
games does not handle scores and cannot represent games in which players want
to maximize a quantity.
  In this work, we introduce scoring positional games, that consist in playing
on a hypergraph until all the vertices are claimed, and by defining the score
as the number of hyperedges a player has fully taken. We focus here on
Incidence, a scoring positional game played on a 2-uniform hypergraph, i.e. an
undirected graph. In this game, two players alternately claim the vertices of a
graph and score the number of edges for which they own both end vertices. In
the Maker-Breaker version, Maker aims at maximizing the number of edges she
owns, while Breaker aims at minimizing it. In the Maker-Maker version, both
players try to take more edges than their opponent.
  We first give some general results on scoring positional games such that
their membership in Milnor's universe and some general bounds on the score. We
prove that, surprisingly, computing the score in the Maker-Breaker version of
Incidence is PSPACE-complete whereas in the Maker-Maker convention, the
relative score can be obtained in polynomial time. In addition, for the
Maker-Breaker convention, we give a formula for the score on paths by using
some equivalences due to Milnor's universe. This result implies that the score
on cycles can also be computed in polynomial time.

communication (ISAC) system, in which a set of multi-antenna base stations
(BSs) employ the coordinated transmit beamforming to serve their respectively
associated single-antenna communication users (CUs), and at the same time reuse
the reflected information signals to perform joint target detection. In
particular, we consider two target detection scenarios depending on the time
synchronization among BSs. In Scenario \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1},
these BSs are synchronized and can exploit the target-reflected signals over
both the direct links (from each BS to target to itself) and the cross links
(from each BS to target to other BSs) for joint detection. In Scenario
\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, these BSs are not synchronized and can
only utilize target-reflected signals over the direct links for joint
detection. For each scenario, we derive the detection probability under a
specific false alarm probability at any given target location. Based on the
derivation, we optimize the coordinated transmit beamforming at the BSs to
maximize the minimum detection probability over a particular target area, while
ensuring the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints
at the CUs, subject to the maximum transmit power constraints at the BSs. We
use the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique to obtain highly-quality
solutions to the formulated problems. Numerical results show that for each
scenario, the proposed design achieves higher detection probability than the
benchmark scheme based on communication design. It is also shown that the time
synchronization among BSs is beneficial in enhancing the detection performance
as more reflected signal paths are exploited.

adversarial examples. However, most of the existing methods are aimed at
white-box attacks, where the parameters and other information of the
classifiers are known in the attack, which is unrealistic for real-world
applications. In order to improve the attack performance of the black-box
classifiers, the research community generally uses the transfer-based black-box
attack. However, the transferability of current 3D attacks is still relatively
low. To this end, this paper proposes Scale and Shear (SS) Attack to generate
3D adversarial examples with strong transferability. Specifically, we randomly
scale or shear the input point cloud, so that the attack will not overfit the
white-box model, thereby improving the transferability of the attack. Extensive
experiments show that the SS attack proposed in this paper can be seamlessly
combined with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D point cloud attack
methods to form more powerful attack methods, and the SS attack improves the
transferability over 3.6 times compare to the baseline. Moreover, while
substantially outperforming the baseline methods, the SS attack achieves SOTA
transferability under various defenses. Our code will be available online at

high-resolution image synthesis, especially in recent large-scale text-to-image
generation applications. An essential technique for improving the sample
quality of DPMs is guided sampling, which usually needs a large guidance scale
to obtain the best sample quality. The commonly-used fast sampler for guided
sampling is DDIM, a first-order diffusion ODE solver that generally needs 100
to 250 steps for high-quality samples. Although recent works propose dedicated
high-order solvers and achieve a further speedup for sampling without guidance,
their effectiveness for guided sampling has not been well-tested before. In
this work, we demonstrate that previous high-order fast samplers suffer from
instability issues, and they even become slower than DDIM when the guidance
scale grows large. To further speed up guided sampling, we propose
DPM-Solver++, a high-order solver for the guided sampling of DPMs. DPM-Solver++
solves the diffusion ODE with the data prediction model and adopts thresholding
methods to keep the solution matches training data distribution. We further
propose a multistep variant of DPM-Solver++ to address the instability issue by
reducing the effective step size. Experiments show that DPM-Solver++ can
generate high-quality samples within only 15 to 20 steps for guided sampling by
pixel-space and latent-space DPMs.

coefficients is a common task in multiple applications of digital image
processing, including image compression, selective image encryption, and image
communications. This paper investigates recovery of a special type of
information in DCT coefficients of digital images: sign bits. This problem can
be modelled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is
NP-hard in general. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose two
approximation methods: 1) a relaxation-based method that convert the MILP
problem to a linear programming (LP) problem; 2) a divide-and-conquer method
which splits the target image into sufficiently small regions, each of which
can be more efficiently solved as an MILP problem, and then conducts a global
optimization phase as a smaller MILP problem or an LP problem to maximize
smoothness across different regions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first who considered how to use global optimization to recover sign bits of DCT
coefficients. We considered how the proposed methods can be applied to
JPEG-encoded images and conducted extensive experiments to validate the
performances of our proposed methods. The experimental results showed that the
proposed methods worked well, especially when the number of unknown sign bits
per DCT block is not too large. Compared with other existing methods, which are
all based on simple error-concealment strategies, our proposed methods
outperformed them with a substantial margin, both according to objective
quality metrics (PSNR and SSIM) and also our subjective evaluation. Our work
has a number of profound implications, e.g., more sign bits can be discarded to
develop more efficient image compression methods, and image encryption methods
based on sign bit encryption can be less secure than we previously understood.

uncertainty in the constraints via a linear programming formulation. We exploit
this connection to derive an algorithmic framework that can be used to solve
both problems under uncertainty, obtaining nearly tight bounds on the
competitive ratio. This is the first non-trivial stochastic result concerning
the sum of unknown values without further structure known for the set. Further,

operating on the Beijing Electron Positron Collider II (BEPCII). After more
than ten year's operation, the efficiency of the inner layers of the Main Drift
Chamber (MDC) decreased significantly. To solve this issue, the BESIII
collaboration is planning to replace the inner part of the MDC with three
layers of Cylindrical triple Gas Electron Multipliers (CGEM). The transverse
plane spatial resolution of CGEM is required to be 120 $\mu$m or better. To
meet this goal, a careful calibration of the detector is necessary to fully
exploit the potential of the CGEM detector. In all the calibrations, the
detector alignment plays an important role to improve the detector precision.
The track-based alignment for the CGEM detector with the Millepede algorithm is
implemented to reduce the uncertainties of the hit position measurement. Using
the cosmic-ray data taken in 2020 with the two layers setup, the displacement
and rotation of the outer layer with respect to the inner layer is determined
by a simultaneous fit applied to more than 160000 tracks. A good alignment
precision has been achieved that guarantees the design request could be
satisfied in the future. A further alignment is going to be performed using the
combined information of tracks from cosmic-ray and collisions after the CGEM is
installed into the BESIII detector.

hole mergers has spurred a renewed interest in possible deviations from General
Relativity (GR), since they could be detected in the GWs emitted by such
systems. Of particular interest is the ringdown phase of a binary black hole
merger, which can be described by linear perturbations about a background
stationary black hole solution. These perturbations mainly correspond to a
superposition of 'quasi-normal modes' (QNMs), whose frequencies form a discrete
set. One expects that modified gravity models could predict QNMs that differ
from their GR counterpart: the detailed analysis of the GW signal represents an
invaluable window to test GR and to look for specific signatures of modified
gravity.
  The work done in this thesis takes place in the context of scalar-tensor
theories of gravity, and more particularly the Degenerate Higher-Order
Scalar-Tensor theories. We start by a review of these theories and their
properties, and describe a way to reformulate them in a framework with a clear
geometrical interpretation. We then study linear perturbations about several
existing nonrotating black hole solutions of such theories, and show why the
perturbation equations obtained are very hard to decouple in general. When it
is possible, in the case of odd parity perturbations, we describe the
propagation of waves and relate it to the stability of the underlying
spacetime. When it is not, we circumvent the difficulty by making use of an
algorithm proposed recently in the mathematical literature that allows us to
decouple the equations both at the black hole horizon and at infinity. This
allows us to get the asymptotic behaviour of waves on such spacetimes, yielding
valuable information that can allow us to rule some of them out. Finally, we
use the asymptotic behaviours obtained to compute QNMs numerically.

their actions by observing the states and maximize their cumulative rewards
over time. For each node, the state consists of transmit power, link quality
and signal strength; the action adjusts the transmit power; and the reward
combines energy efficiency (throughput normalized by energy consumption) and
penalty of changing the transmit power. As the state space is large, Q-learning
is hard to implement on embedded platforms with limited memory and processing

points in order to unify data size and reduce computational cost, to name a
few. Recent research on point cloud downsampling has achieved great success
which concentrates on learning to sample in a task-aware way. However, existing
learnable samplers can not directly perform arbitrary-size downsampling, and
assume the input size is fixed. In this paper, we introduce the AS-PD, a novel
task-aware sampling framework that directly downsamples point clouds to any
smaller size based on a sample-to-refine strategy. Given an input point cloud
of arbitrary size, we first perform a task-agnostic pre-sampling on the input
point cloud to a specified sample size. Then, we obtain the sampled set by
refining the pre-sampled set to make it task-aware, driven by downstream task
losses. The refinement is realized by adding each pre-sampled point with a
small offset predicted by point-wise multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). With the
density encoding and proper training scheme, the framework can learn to
adaptively downsample point clouds of different input sizes to arbitrary sample
sizes. We evaluate sampled results for classification and registration tasks,
respectively. The proposed AS-PD surpasses the state-of-the-art method in terms
of downstream performance. Further experiments also show that our AS-PD
exhibits better generality to unseen task models, implying that the proposed
sampler is optimized to the task rather than a specified task model.

particularly efficient for short range settings as they carry rich information

exploit the rich signature of these sensors. However, ML classifiers are
susceptible to adversarial examples, which are created from raw data to fool
the classifier such that it assigns the input to the wrong class. These attacks
represent a serious threat to systems integrity, especially for safety-critical
applications. In this work, we present a new adversarial attack on UWB radars
in which an adversary injects adversarial radio noise in the wireless channel
to cause an obstacle recognition failure. First, based on signals collected in
real-life environment, we show that conventional attacks fail to generate
robust noise under realistic conditions. We propose a-RNA, i.e., Adversarial
Radio Noise Attack to overcome these issues. Specifically, a-RNA generates an
adversarial noise that is efficient without synchronization between the input
signal and the noise. Moreover, a-RNA generated noise is, by-design, robust
against pre-processing countermeasures such as filtering-based defenses.
Moreover, in addition to the undetectability objective by limiting the noise
magnitude budget, a-RNA is also efficient in the presence of sophisticated

optimal design of health insurance. However, consumers are rarely given
spending information at the time they consume care, a delay which many models

consumption. We study household responses to scheduled medical services before
and after pricing information arrives, leveraging quasi-experimental variation
in the time it takes for an insurer to process a bill. Immediately after
scheduled services, households increase their spending by roughly 46%; however,
a bill's arrival causes households to reduce their spending by 7 percentage
points (nearly 20% of the initial increase). These corrections are concentrated
among households who are under-informed about their deductible or whose
expenditures fall just short of meeting the deductible, suggesting that a bill
provides useful pricing information. These corrections occur across many types
of health services, including high- and low-value care. We model household
beliefs and learning about expenditures and find that households overestimate
their expenditures by 10% prior to a bill's arrival. This leads to an
over-consumption of $842.80 ($480.59) for the average (median) affected
household member. There is evidence that households learn from repeated use of
medical services; however, household priors are estimated to be as high as 80%

provides new avenues for solving inverse problems, and has been widely studied.
Currently, most DL inversion methods for resistivity are purely data-driven and
depend heavily on labels (real resistivity models). However, real resistivity
models are difficult to obtain through field surveys. An inversion network may
not be effectively trained without labels. In this study, we built an
unsupervised learning resistivity inversion scheme based on the physical law of
electric field propagation. First, a forward modeling process was embedded into
the network training, which converted the predicted model to predicted data and
formed a data misfit to the observation data. Unsupervised training independent
of the real model was realized using the data misfit as a loss function.
Moreover, a dynamic smoothing constraint was imposed on the loss function to
alleviate the ill-posed inverse problem. Finally, a transfer learning scheme
was applied to adapt the trained network with simulated data to field data.
Numerical simulations and field tests showed that the proposed method can

has been widely applied to many machine learning tasks such as meta learning,
hyperparameter learning and policy optimization. Although many bilevel
optimization algorithms recently have been developed, few adaptive algorithm
focuses on the bilevel optimization under the distributed setting. It is well
known that the adaptive gradient methods show superior performances on both
distributed and non-distributed optimization. In the paper, thus, we propose a
novel adaptive federated bilevel optimization algorithm (i.e.,AdaFBiO) to solve
the distributed bilevel optimization problems, where the objective function of
Upper-Level (UL) problem is possibly nonconvex, and that of Lower-Level (LL)
problem is strongly convex. Specifically, our AdaFBiO algorithm builds on the
momentum-based variance reduced technique and local-SGD to obtain the best
known sample and communication complexities simultaneously. In particular, our
AdaFBiO algorithm uses the unified adaptive matrices to flexibly incorporate
various adaptive learning rates to update variables in both UL and LL problems.
Moreover, we provide a convergence analysis framework for our AdaFBiO
algorithm, and prove it needs the sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ with communication complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point.
Experimental results on federated hyper-representation learning and federated
data hyper-cleaning tasks verify efficiency of our algorithm.

necessary to have $m \asymp 1/\epsilon^2$, where $\epsilon$ measures the
separation between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in total variation
($\mathsf{TV}$). Achieving this, however, requires complete knowledge of the
distributions and can be done, for example, using the Neyman-Pearson test. In
this paper we consider a variation of the problem, which we call
likelihood-free (or simulation-based) hypothesis testing, where access to
$\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ is given through $n$ iid observations from each. In
the case when $\mathbb P,\mathbb Q$ are assumed to belong to a non-parametric
family $\mathcal P$, we demonstrate the existence of a fundamental trade-off
between $n$ and $m$ given by $nm \asymp n^2_\mathsf{GoF}(\epsilon,\cal P)$,
where $n_\mathsf{GoF}$ is the minimax sample complexity of testing between the
hypotheses $H_0: \mathbb P= \mathbb Q$ vs $H_1: \mathsf{TV}(\mathbb P,\mathbb

$\beta$-smooth densities supported on $[0,1]^d$, the Gaussian sequence model
over a Sobolev ellipsoid, and the collection of distributions on alphabet
$[k]=\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ with pmfs bounded by $c/k$ for fixed $c$. For the larger
family of all distributions on $[k]$ we obtain a more complicated trade-off
that exhibits a phase-transition. The test that we propose, based on the

testing without fully estimating the distributions, provided

physical contact networks, finding the following: a) Events of different orders
close in time tend to be also close in topology; b) Nodes participating in many
different groups (events) of a given order tend to involve in many different
groups (events) of another order; Thus, individuals tend to be consistently
active or inactive in events across orders; c) Local events that are close in

evident temporal correlation of local events has been observed in collaboration
networks. Such differences between the two classes of networks may be explained
by the fact that physical contacts are proximity based, in contrast to
collaboration networks. Our methods may facilitate the investigation of how

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite monocular 3D object detection having recently made a significant leap
forward thanks to the use of pre-trained depth estimators for pseudo-LiDAR
recovery, such two-stage methods typically suffer from overfitting and are
incapable of explicitly encapsulating the geometric relation between depth and
object bounding box. To overcome this limitation, we instead propose OPA-3D, a
single-stage, end-to-end, Occlusion-Aware Pixel-Wise Aggregation network that
to jointly estimate dense scene depth with depth-bounding box residuals and
object bounding boxes, allowing a two-stream detection of 3D objects, leading
to significantly more robust detections. Thereby, the geometry stream denoted
as the Geometry Stream, combines visible depth and depth-bounding box residuals
to recover the object bounding box via explicit occlusion-aware optimization.
In addition, a bounding box based geometry projection scheme is employed in an
effort to enhance distance perception. The second stream, named as the Context
Stream, directly regresses 3D object location and size. This novel two-stream
representation further enables us to enforce cross-stream consistency terms
which aligns the outputs of both streams, improving the overall performance.
Extensive experiments on the public benchmark demonstrate that OPA-3D
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the main Car category, whilst keeping a
real-time inference speed. We plan to release all codes and trained models
soon.

our trials on smart workplace implementation have encountered a few problems
ranging from the theoretical confusion among different stakeholders, to the

considering the unique characteristics of outdoor work (e.g., more

created automatically. This paper presents a study of different optimization
methods for modeling and solving the RT patient scheduling problem, which can
be used as decision support when implementing an automatic scheduling algorithm
in practice. We introduce an Integer Programming (IP) model, a column
generation IP model (CG-IP), and a Constraint Programming model. Patients are
scheduled on multiple machine types considering their priority for treatment,
session duration and allowed machines. Expected future patient arrivals are
included in the models as placeholder patients. Since different cancer centers
can have different scheduling objectives, the models are compared using
multiple objective functions, including minimizing waiting times, and
maximizing the fulfillment of patients' preferences for treatment times. The
test data is generated from historical data from Iridium Netwerk, Belgium's
largest cancer center with 10 linear accelerators. The results demonstrate that
the CG-IP model can solve all the different problem instances to a mean
optimality gap of less than 1% within one hour. The proposed methodology
provides a tool for automated scheduling of RT treatments and can be generally
applied to RT centers.

decremental all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem. For undirected graphs with
$m$ edges and $n$ nodes undergoing edge deletions, we provide two new
approximate decremental APSP algorithms, one for weighted and one for
unweighted graphs. Our first result is an algorithm that supports $(2+
\epsilon)$-approximate all-pairs constant-time distance queries with total
update time $\tilde{O}(m^{1/2}n^{3/2})$ when $m= O(n^{5/3})$ (and $m= n^{1+c}$
for any constant $c >0$), or $\tilde{O}(mn^{2/3})$ when $m = \Omega(n^{5/3})$.
Prior to our work the fastest algorithm for weighted graphs with approximation
at most $3$ had total $\tilde O(mn)$ update time [Bernstein, SICOMP'16]. Our
technique also yields a decremental algorithm with total update time
$\tilde{O}(nm^{3/4})$ supporting $(2+\epsilon, W_{u,v})$-approximate queries.
  Our second result is a decremental algorithm that given an unweighted graph
and a constant integer $k \geq 2 $, supports $(1+\epsilon, 2(k-1))$-approximate
queries and has $\tilde{O}(n^{2-1/k}m^{1/k})$ total update time (when
$m=n^{1+c}$ for any constant $c >0$). For comparison, in the special case of
$(1+\epsilon, 2)$-approximation, this improves over the state-of-the-art by
[Henzinger et al., SICOMP'16] with total update time of $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$.
All of our results are randomized and work against an oblivious adversary.
  Our approach also leads to a new static distance oracle construction. In
particular, we construct a distance oracle in $\tilde O(mn^{2/3})$ time that
supports constant time $2$-approximate queries. For sparse graphs, the
preprocessing time of the algorithm matches conditional lower bounds [Patrascu
et al., FOCS'12; Abboud et al., STOC'23]. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first 2-approximate distance oracle that has subquadratic preprocessing
time in sparse graphs.

\rev{Especially if many projections are taken, a large amount of data has to be

However, these issues are especially exacerbated when sparse imaging scenarios

we investigate the suitability of learning-based improvements to the
challenging task of obtaining high-quality reconstructions from sparse

reference data for the training procedure, we propose an unsupervised denoising

nanoparticles or nanowires as substrates for neuromorphic computing. These

analogy with biological neural networks characterized by self-organization,

formalize a generalization of the perceptron model to describe a classification
device based on a network of interacting units where the input weights are
nonlinearly dependent. We show that this model, called ""receptron"", provides
substantial advantages compared to the perceptron as, for example, the solution
of non-linearly separable Boolean functions with a single device. The receptron
model is used as a starting point for the implementation of an all-optical
device that exploits the non-linearity of optical speckle fields produced by a
solid scatterer. By encoding these speckle fields we generated a large variety
of target Boolean functions without the need for time-consuming machine
learning algorithms. We demonstrate that by properly setting the model
parameters, different classes of functions with different multiplicity can be
solved efficiently. The optical implementation of the receptron scheme opens
the way for the fabrication of a completely new class of optical devices for
neuromorphic data processing based on a very simple hardware.

Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) neutrino oscillation program, as well as
searches for physics beyond the standard model, supernova neutrino detection,
and solar neutrino measurements. This article describes the selection and
reconstruction of low-energy (Michel) electrons in the ProtoDUNE-SP detector.
ProtoDUNE-SP is one of the prototypes for the DUNE far detector, built and
operated at CERN as a charged particle test beam experiment. A sample of
low-energy electrons produced by the decay of cosmic muons is selected with a
purity of 95%. This sample is used to calibrate the low-energy electron energy
scale with two techniques. An electron energy calibration based on a cosmic ray
muon sample uses calibration constants derived from measured and simulated
cosmic ray muon events. Another calibration technique makes use of the
theoretically well-understood Michel electron energy spectrum to convert
reconstructed charge to electron energy. In addition, the effects of detector
response to low-energy electron energy scale and its resolution including
readout electronics threshold effects are quantified. Finally, the relation
between the theoretical and reconstructed low-energy electron energy spectrum
is derived and the energy resolution is characterized. The low-energy electron
selection presented here accounts for about 75% of the total electron deposited
energy. After the addition of lost energy using a Monte Carlo simulation, the
energy resolution improves from about 40% to 25% at 50~MeV. These results are
used to validate the expected capabilities of the DUNE far detector to
reconstruct low-energy electrons.

mid-dimensional distributions, Afifi showed in 1954 that projectability of the
Levi-Civita connection characterizes, locally, the case of Patterson and
Walker's Riemann extension metrics. We extend this correspondence to null
parallel distributions of any dimension, introducing a suitable generalization
of Riemann extensions.

in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. In a $K$-user network with spatial
multiplexing gains of $L$ at the transmitter and $G$ at every receiver, if each
user can cache a fraction $\gamma$ of the file library, a total number of
$GK\gamma + L$ data streams can be served in parallel. In this paper, we focus
on improving the finite-SNR performance of MIMO-CC systems. We first consider a
MIMO-CC scheme that relies only on unicasting individual data streams, and
then, introduce a decomposition strategy to design a new scheme that delivers
the same data streams through multicasting of $G$ parallel codewords. We
discuss how optimized beamformers could be designed for each scheme and use
numerical simulations to compare their finite-SNR performance. It is shown that
while both schemes serve the same number of streams, multicasting provides
notable performance improvements. This is because, with multicasting,
transmission vectors are built with fewer beamformers, leading to more
efficient usage of available power resources.

for ordinal data. We focus on pure-tone audiometry hearing threshold data,
where thresholds are measured in 5 decibel increments. We estimate the
intracluster correlation for tests from iPhone-based hearing assessment
application as a measure of test/retest reliability. Methods: We present a
method to estimate the intracluster correlation using mixed effects cumulative
logistic and probit models, which assume the outcome data are ordinal. This
contrasts with using a mixed effects linear model which assumes that the
outcome data are continuous. Results: In simulation studies we show that using
a mixed effects linear model to estimate the intracluster correlation for
ordinal data results in a negative finite sample bias, while using mixed
effects cumulative logistic or probit models reduces this bias. The estimated
intracluster correlation for the iPhone-based hearing assessment application is
higher when using the mixed effects cumulative logistic and probit models
compared to using a mixed effects linear model. Conclusion: When data are
ordinal, using mixed effects cumulative logistic or probit models reduces the
bias of intracluster correlation estimates relative to using a mixed effects
linear model.

simulations using LHC-tuned hadronic interaction models underestimate the
number of muons in extensive air showers compared to experimental data. This is
the so-called muon deficit problem. Determination of the muon component in the
air shower is crucial for inferring the mass of the primary particle, which is
a key ingredient in the efforts to pinpoint the sources of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays.In this paper, we present a new method to derive the muon signal in
detectors, which uses the difference between the total reconstructed (data) and
simulated signals is roughly independent of the zenith angle, but depends on
the mass of the primary cosmic ray. Such a method offers an opportunity not
only to test/calibrate the hadronic interaction models, but also to derive the
$\beta$ exponent, which describes an increase of the number of muons in a
shower as a function of the energy and mass of the primary cosmic ray. Detailed
simulations show a dependence of the $\beta$ exponent on hadronic interaction
properties, thus the determination of this parameter is important for
understanding the muon deficit problem. We validate the method by using Monte
Carlo simulations for the EPOS-LHC and QGSJetII-04 hadronic interaction models,
and showing that this method allows us to recover the ratio of the muon signal
between EPOS-LHC and QGSJetII-04 and the average $\beta$ exponent for the
studied system, within less than a few percent. This is a consequence of the
good recovery of the muon signal for each primary included in the analysis.

  Semantic Segmentation with Scene-Level Annotations",,,,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Point cloud segmentation with scene-level annotations is a promising but
challenging task. Currently, the most popular way is to employ the class
activation map (CAM) to locate discriminative regions and then generate
point-level pseudo labels from scene-level annotations. However, these methods
always suffer from the point imbalance among categories, as well as the sparse
and incomplete supervision from CAM. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted
hypergraph convolutional network-based method, called WHCN, to confront the
challenges of learning point-wise labels from scene-level annotations. Firstly,
in order to simultaneously overcome the point imbalance among different
categories and reduce the model complexity, superpoints of a training point
cloud are generated by exploiting the geometrically homogeneous partition.
Then, a hypergraph is constructed based on the high-confidence superpoint-level
seeds which are converted from scene-level annotations. Secondly, the WHCN
takes the hypergraph as input and learns to predict high-precision point-level
pseudo labels by label propagation. Besides the backbone network consisting of
spectral hypergraph convolution blocks, a hyperedge attention module is learned
to adjust the weights of hyperedges in the WHCN. Finally, a segmentation
network is trained by these pseudo point cloud labels. We comprehensively
conduct experiments on the ScanNet and S3DIS segmentation datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WHCN is effective to predict
the point labels with scene annotations, and yields state-of-the-art results in
the community. The source code is available at

carrier doping and electro-optical Pockels and Kerr effects, usually considered
insignificant, open up the possibility of infinitesimal permittivity
asymmetries for on-demand, and dynamically tuneable optical resonances of
extremely high quality factors. We probe the excitation of
permittivity-asymmetric qBICs (${\varepsilon}$-qBICs) using a prototype
Si/TiO$_{2}$ metasurface, in which the asymmetry in the unit cell is provided
by the refractive index contrast of the dissimilar materials, surpassing any
unwanted asymmetries from nanofabrication defects or angular deviations of
light from normal incidence. ${\varepsilon}$-qBICs can also be excited in 1D
gratings, where quality-factor enhancement and tailored interference phenomena

demonstrated. The emergence of ${\varepsilon}$-qBICs in systems with broken

SysBinder for constructing a novel structured representation called Block-Slot

significantly better factor disentanglement within the slots than the

expanding the existing plant-based biopolymer resists by a bio-based monomer

the first photoinitator is a good two-photon absorber at the applied

interface between an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI) and a two-dimensional
(2D) metal can pump spin polarization into the metal. It is assumed that
localized spins of a collinear AFMI interact with itinerant electrons through
their exchange interaction on the interface. We employed the formalism of
Keldysh Green's functions for electrons which experience potential and
spin-orbit scattering on random impurities. This formalism allows a unified
analysis of spin pumping, spin diffusion and spin relaxation effects on a 2D
electron gas. It is shown that the pumping of a nonstaggered magnetization into
the metal film takes place in the second order with respect to the interface
exchange interaction. At sufficiently weak spin relaxation this pumping effect
can be much stronger than the first-order effect of the Pauli magnetism which
is produced by the small nonstaggered exchange field of the DW. It is shown
that the pumped polarization is sensitive to the geometry of the electron's
Fermi surface and increases when the wave vector of the staggered magnetization
approaches the nesting vector of the Fermi surface. In a disordered diffusive
electron gas the induced spin polarization follows the motion of the domain
wall. It is distributed asymmetrically around the DW over a distance which can
be much larger than the DW width.

that the Fermi surface nesting is triggered by two nesting vectors, whereas the

novel decoding algorithm which performs close to the maximum likelihood decoder
for short-length Reed-Muller codes. Recently, an extension to RPA decoding,
called sparse multi-decoder RPA (SRPA), has been proposed [2]. The SRPA
approach makes use of multiple pruned RPA decoders to lower the amount of
computations while keeping the performance loss small compared to RPA decoding.
However, the use of multiple sparse decoders again increases the computational
burden. Therefore, the focus is on the optimization of sparse single-decoder
RPA decoding to keep the complexity small. In this paper, a novel method is
proposed, to select subsets of subspaces used in the projection and aggregation
step of SRPA decoding in order to decrease the decoding error probability on
AWGN channels. The proposed method replaces the random selection of subspace
subsets with a semi-deterministic selection method based on a figure of merit
that evaluates the performance of each subspace. Our simulation results show
that the semi-deterministic subspace selection improves the decoding
performance up to $0.2\,\text{dB}$ compared to SRPA. At the same time, the
complexity of SRPA decoding for RM codes of order $r\geq 3$ is reduced by up to
81% compared to SRPA.

evaluate the performance of a wide range of point cloud-based solutions, such

cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods dedicate to assigning absolute quality
scores to distorted point clouds. Their performance is strongly reliant on the
quality and quantity of subjective ground-truth scores for training, which are
challenging to gather and have been shown to be imprecise, biased, and
inconsistent. Furthermore, the majority of existing objective geometry quality
assessment approaches are carried out by full-reference traditional metrics. So
far, point-based no-reference geometry-only quality assessment techniques have
not yet been investigated. This paper presents PRL-GQA, the first pairwise
learning framework for no-reference geometry-only quality assessment of point
clouds, to the best of our knowledge. The proposed PRL-GQA framework employs a
siamese deep architecture, which takes as input a pair of point clouds and
outputs their rank order. Each siamese architecture branch is a geometry
quality assessment network (GQANet), which is designed to extract multi-scale
quality-aware geometric features and output a quality index for the input point
cloud. Then, based on the predicted quality indexes, a pairwise rank learning
module is introduced to rank the relative quality of a pair of degraded point
clouds.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
PRL-GQA framework. Furthermore, the results also show that the fine-tuned
no-reference GQANet performs competitively when compared to existing
full-reference geometry quality assessment metrics.

discover transients, the deep fields will have repeated observations over a

explore how useful the deep field observations will be for measuring properties
of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using simulations that include $Euclid$'s
planned depth, area and cadence in the deep fields, we calculate that more than
3700 SNe between $0.0<z<1.5$ will have at least five $Euclid$ detections around
peak with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3. While on their own, $Euclid$
light curves are not good enough to directly constrain distances, when combined
with LSST deep field observations, we find that uncertainties on SN distances
are reduced by 20-30% for $z<0.8$ and by 40-50% for $z>0.8$. Furthermore, we
predict how well additional $Euclid$ mock data can be used to constrain a key
systematic in SN Ia studies - the size of the luminosity 'step' found between
SNe hosted in high mass ($>10^{10} M_{\odot}$) and low mass ($>10^{10}
M_{\odot}$) galaxies. This measurement has unique information in the rest-frame
NIR. We predict that if the step is caused by dust, we will be able to measure
its reduction in the NIR compared to optical at the 4$\sigma$ level. We
highlight that the LSST and $Euclid$ observing strategies used in this work are
still provisional and some level of joint processing is required. Still, these
first results are promising, and assuming $Euclid$ begins observations well
before the Nancy Roman Space Telescope (Roman), we expect this dataset to be

  Covering arrays have applications in the testing of large-scale complex

  Additionally it has been conjectured that the $\log \log k$ term can be

including but not limited to the rapid delivery of emergency and disaster
messages. Although various benchmark algorithms have been developed to date for
message delivery in such applications, they pose several practical challenges
such as insufficient network coverage and/or highly redundant transmissions to
expand the coverage area, resulting in considerable energy consumption for each
IoT device. To overcome this problem, we first characterize a new performance
metric, forwarding efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the coverage
probability to the average number of transmissions per device, to evaluate the
data dissemination performance more appropriately. Then, we propose a novel and
effective forwarding method, fishbone forwarding (FiFo), which aims to improve
the forwarding efficiency with acceptable computational complexity. Our FiFo
method completes two tasks: 1) it clusters devices based on the unweighted pair
group method with the arithmetic average; and 2) it creates the main axis and
sub axes of each cluster using both the expectation-maximization algorithm for
the Gaussian mixture model and principal component analysis. We demonstrate the
superiority of FiFo by using a real-world dataset. Through intensive and
comprehensive simulations, we show that the proposed FiFo method outperforms
benchmark algorithms in terms of the forwarding efficiency.

graph neural networks? Graph augmentation has been widely utilized to boost the
learning performance of GNN-based models. However, most existing approaches
only enhance spatial structure within an input static graph by transforming the
graph, and do not consider dynamics caused by time such as temporal locality,
i.e., recent edges are more influential than earlier ones, which remains
challenging for dynamic graph augmentation. In this work, we propose TiaRa
(Time-aware Random Walk Diffusion), a novel diffusion-based method for
augmenting a dynamic graph represented as a discrete-time sequence of graph
snapshots. For this purpose, we first design a time-aware random walk proximity
so that a surfer can walk along the time dimension as well as edges, resulting
in spatially and temporally localized scores. We then derive our diffusion
matrices based on the time-aware random walk, and show they become enhanced
adjacency matrices that both spatial and temporal localities are augmented.
Throughout extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TiaRa effectively
augments a given dynamic graph, and leads to significant improvements in
dynamic GNN models for various graph datasets and tasks.

detection from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, previous works relied
on supervised learning techniques to distinguish between normal and abnormal
samples. This method limits the type of anomalies that can be classified as the
anomalies need to be present in the training data. Further, many data points
from normal and anomaly class are needed for the model to achieve satisfactory
classification performance. However, experienced clinicians can segregate
between normal samples (healthy maxillary sinus) and anomalous samples
(anomalous maxillary sinus) after looking at a few normal samples. We mimic the
clinicians ability by learning the distribution of healthy maxillary sinuses
using a 3D convolutional auto-encoder (cAE) and its variant, a 3D variational
autoencoder (VAE) architecture and evaluate cAE and VAE for this task.
Concretely, we pose the paranasal anomaly detection as an unsupervised anomaly
detection problem. Thereby, we are able to reduce the labelling effort of the
clinicians as we only use healthy samples during training. Additionally, we can
classify any type of anomaly that differs from the training distribution. We
train our 3D cAE and VAE to learn a latent representation of healthy maxillary
sinus volumes using L1 reconstruction loss. During inference, we use the
reconstruction error to classify between normal and anomalous maxillary
sinuses. We extract sub-volumes from larger head and neck MRIs and analyse the
effect of different fields of view on the detection performance. Finally, we
report which anomalies are easiest and hardest to classify using our approach.
Our results demonstrate the feasibility of unsupervised detection of paranasal
anomalies from MRIs with an AUPRC of 85% and 80% for cAE and VAE, respectively.

end-to-end LBM was employed for QPR under laboratory conditions and its
robustness was investigated across various system and object conditions. The
robustness of the method was tested via varying propagation distances and its
generalizability with respect to object structure and experimental data was
also tested. Although the LBM was stable under the studied variations, its

Wyner's and G\'acs-K\""orner-Witsenhausen's (GKW's) CI. In PartII, we discuss

This includes the R\'enyi CI which forms a bridge between Wyner's CI and the

exact CI strictly exceeds Wyner's CI. Other closely related topics discussed in

stability or NICD problem in which we quantify the agreement probability of
extracted bits from a bivariate source. We then extend this to the $k$-user
NICD and $q$-stability problems, and discuss various conjectures in information
theory and discrete probability, such as the Courtade-Kumar, Li-M\'edard and
Mossell-O'Donnell conjectures. Finally, we consider hypercontractivity and
Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, which further generalize noise stability via
replacing the Boolean functions therein by nonnnegative functions. The key

gravitomagnetic frame-dragging effect, known as the Lense-Thirring effect, that
has been experimentally confirmed in the weak-field limit. In the strong-field
limit, near the horizon of a rotating black hole, frame dragging becomes so
extreme that all objects must co-rotate with the black hole's angular momentum.
In this work, we perform general relativistic numerical simulations to identify
observable signatures of frame dragging in the strong-field limit that appear
when infalling gas is forced to flip its direction of rotation as it is being
accreted. In total intensity images, infalling streams exhibit ""S""-shaped
features due to the switch in the tangential velocity. In linear polarization,
a flip in the handedness of spatially resolved polarization ticks as a function
of radius encodes a transition in the magnetic field geometry that occurs due
to magnetic flux freezing in the dragged plasma. Using a network of telescopes
around the world, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration has demonstrated
that it is now possible to directly image black holes on event horizon scales.
We show that the phenomena described in this work would be accessible to the
next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and extensions of the array
into space, which would produce spatially resolved images on event horizon
scales with higher spatial resolution and dynamic range.

corresponding measurement is challenging. To address this issue, we are aimed
to develop an assessment strategy for efficiently examining the foam properties
by combining multiscale modelling and deep learning. The multiscale modelling
is based on the finite element (FE) simulation employing representative volume
elements (RVEs) with random cellular morphologies, mimicking the typical
features of closed-cell Aluminium foams. A deep learning database is
constructed for training the designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
establish a direct link between the mesoscopic porosity characteristics and the
effective Youngs modulus of foams. The error range of CNN models leads to an
uncertain mechanical performance, which is further evaluated in a structural
uncertainty analysis on the FG porous three-layer beam consisting of two thin
high-density layers and a thick low-density one, where the imprecise CNN
predicted moduli are represented as triangular fuzzy numbers in double
parametric form. The uncertain beam bending deflections under a mid-span point
load are calculated with the aid of Timoshenko beam theory and the Ritz method.
Our findings suggest the success in training CNN models to estimate RVE modulus

bands linear in the proximity of the Brillouin-zone boundary and the Fermi
energy, creates anomalous situations where small Fermi-energy perturbations are
known to critically affect the electron-related lattice properties of the
system. The Fermi-surface nesting (FSN) conditions determining such effects via
electron-phonon interaction, require accurate estimates of the crystal's
response function $(\chi)$ as a function of the phonon wavevector q for any
values of temperature. Numerous analytical estimates of $\chi(q)$ for 2D Dirac
crystals beyond the Thomas-Fermi approximation have been so far carried out
only in terms of dielectric response function $\chi(q,\omega)$, for photon and
optical-phonon perturbations, due to relative ease of incorporating a
q-independent oscillation frequency in their calculation. However, models
accounting for Dirac-electron interaction with ever-existing acoustic phonons,
for which $\omega$ does depend on q and is therefore dispersive, are essential
to understand many critical crystal properties. The lack of such models has
often led to assume that the dielectric response function $\chi(q)$ in these
systems can be understood from free-electron behavior. Here, we show that,
different from free-electron systems, $\chi(q)$ calculated from acoustic
phonons in 2D Dirac crystals using the Lindhard model, exhibits a cuspidal
point at the FSN condition. Strong variability of $\frac{\partial\chi}{\partial
q}$ persists also at finite temperatures, while $\chi(q)$ may tend to infinity
in the dynamic case even where the speed of sound is small, albeit
nonnegligible, over the Dirac-electron Fermi velocity. The implications of our
findings for electron-acoustic phonon interaction and transport properties such
as the phonon line width derived from the phonon self energy will also be

  without expert intervention: an exploratory study",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The low replication rate of published studies has long concerned the social
science community, making understanding the replicability a critical problem.
Several studies have shown that relevant research communities can make
predictions about the replicability of individual studies with above-chance
accuracy. Follow-up work further indicates that laypeople can also achieve
above-chance accuracy in predicting replicability when experts interpret the
studies into short descriptions that are more accessible for laypeople. The
involvement of scarce expert resources may make these methods expensive from
financial and time perspectives. In this work, we explored whether laypeople
can predict the replicability of social science studies without expert
intervention. We presented laypeople with raw materials truncated from
published social science papers and elicited their answers to questions related
to the paper. Our results suggested that laypeople were engaged in this
technical task, providing reasonable and self-contained answers. The majority
of them also demonstrated a good understanding of the material. However, the
solicited information had limited predictive power on the actual replication
outcomes. We further discuss several lessons we learned compared to the
approach with expert intervention to inspire future works.

For the HMS unit cells, the wire-loop topology is deployed to achieve high

is analyzed by full-wave simulations and experiments. The simulation results
demonstrate that the scan angle doubles when the incident angle is below
15{\deg} in accordance to the design specification. Furthermore, the
directivity degradation of the refracted beams by the two-HMS lenses is in good

Haskell","Learning to Price Supply Chain Contracts against a Learning Retailer",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT cs.MA econ.TH stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The rise of big data analytics has automated the decision-making of companies
and increased supply chain agility. In this paper, we study the supply chain
contract design problem faced by a data-driven supplier who needs to respond to
the inventory decisions of the downstream retailer. Both the supplier and the
retailer are uncertain about the market demand and need to learn about it
sequentially. The goal for the supplier is to develop data-driven pricing
policies with sublinear regret bounds under a wide range of possible retailer
inventory policies for a fixed time horizon.
  To capture the dynamics induced by the retailer's learning policy, we first
make a connection to non-stationary online learning by following the notion of
variation budget. The variation budget quantifies the impact of the retailer's
learning strategy on the supplier's decision-making. We then propose dynamic
pricing policies for the supplier for both discrete and continuous demand. We
also note that our proposed pricing policy only requires access to the support
of the demand distribution, but critically, does not require the supplier to
have any prior knowledge about the retailer's learning policy or the demand
realizations. We examine several well-known data-driven policies for the
retailer, including sample average approximation, distributionally robust
optimization, and parametric approaches, and show that our pricing policies
lead to sublinear regret bounds in all these cases.
  At the managerial level, we answer affirmatively that there is a pricing
policy with a sublinear regret bound under a wide range of retailer's learning
policies, even though she faces a learning retailer and an unknown demand
distribution. Our work also provides a novel perspective in data-driven
operations management where the principal has to learn to react to the learning
policies employed by other agents in the system.

environments is very important. However, it is very difficult to solve the
navigation problem in real time because the computation time is very long due
to the nature of the biped robot having a high degree of freedom. In order to
overcome this, many scientists suggested navigation through the footstep
planning. Usually footstep planning use the shortest distance or angles as the
objective function based on the A * algorithm. Recently, the energy required
for human walking, which is widely used in human dynamics, approximated by a
polynomial function is proposed as a better cost function that explains the
movement of the bipedal robot. In addition, for the real time navigation, using
the action set of the A * algorithm not fixed, but the number changing
according to the situation, so that the computation time does not increase much
and the methods of considering the collision with the external environment are
suggested as a practical method. In this thesis, polynomial function
approximating the energy required for human walking is adopted as a cost
function, and heuristic function considering the angular difference between the
robot and the destination which is not shown in the previous studies is newly
proposed and proved. In addition, a new method to integrate the adaptive
behavior set and energy related to human walking is proposed. Furthermore,
efficient collision avoidance method and a method to reduce the local minimum
problem is proposed in this framework. Finally, footstep planning algorithm
with all of these features into the mapping algorithm and the walking algorithm
to solve the navigation problem is validated with simulation and real robot.

non-equal importance among the parameters. Compared to SVD, the decomposition
method aware of parameter importance is the more practical choice in real
cases. Unlike standard SVD, weighted value decomposition is a non-convex
optimization problem that lacks a closed-form solution. We systematically
investigated multiple optimization strategies to tackle the problem and
examined our method by compressing Transformer-based language models. Further,
we designed a metric to predict when the SVD may introduce a significant
performance drop, for which our method can be a rescue strategy. The extensive
evaluations demonstrate that our method can perform better than current SOTA
methods in compressing Transformer-based language models.

  Optimization Problems",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely used to solve
multi-objective optimization problems. The algorithms rely on setting
appropriate parameters to find good solutions. However, this parameter tuning
could be very computationally expensive in solving non-trial (combinatorial)
optimization problems. This paper proposes a framework that integrates MOEAs
with adaptive parameter control using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The
DRL policy is trained to adaptively set the values that dictate the intensity
and probability of mutation for solutions during optimization. We test the
proposed approach with a simple benchmark problem and a real-world, complex
warehouse design and control problem. The experimental results demonstrate the
advantages of our method in terms of solution quality and computation time to
reach good solutions. In addition, we show the learned policy is transferable,
i.e., the policy trained on a simple benchmark problem can be directly applied
to solve the complex warehouse optimization problem, effectively, without the
need for retraining.

  https://github.com/mengxiangming/QCS-SGM",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the general problem of recovering a high-dimensional signal from
noisy quantized measurements. Quantization, especially coarse quantization such
as 1-bit sign measurements, leads to severe information loss and thus a good
prior knowledge of the unknown signal is helpful for accurate recovery.
Motivated by the power of score-based generative models (SGM, also known as
diffusion models) in capturing the rich structure of natural signals beyond
simple sparsity, we propose an unsupervised data-driven approach called
quantized compressed sensing with SGM (QCS-SGM), where the prior distribution
is modeled by a pre-trained SGM. To perform posterior sampling, an annealed
pseudo-likelihood score called noise perturbed pseudo-likelihood score is
introduced and combined with the prior score of SGM. The proposed QCS-SGM
applies to an arbitrary number of quantization bits. Experiments on a variety
of baseline datasets demonstrate that the proposed QCS-SGM significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin for both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. Moreover, as a posterior
sampling method, QCS-SGM can be easily used to obtain confidence intervals or
uncertainty estimates of the reconstructed results. The code is available at
https://github.com/mengxiangming/QCS-SGM.

  Vehicular Network: A Data Analytic and Stochastic Geometry Approach",,,,,"eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing complexity of urban environments introduces additional
uncertainty to the deployment of the autonomous vehicular network. A novel road
infrastructure cooperative detection model using Joint Communication and
Sensing (JCS) technology is proposed in this article to simultaneously achieve
high-efficient communication and obstacle detection for urban autonomous
vehicles. To suppress the performance fluctuation caused by shadowing and
obstruction to the JCS signals, we first derive the statistic of road obstacles
from the Geographic Information System (GIS). Then, the analysis of JCS channel
characteristics and shadowing factors are presented using Line-of-Sight and
Non-Line-of-Sight (LoS and NLoS) channel models under the complex urban
scenario. A stochastic geometry approach is applied to analyze the interference
factors and the probability distribution of successful JCS detection and
communication. Simulations have been made to verify the cooperative detection
model by probability analysis based on LoS and NLoS channels, and the numerical
results demonstrate several different optimization methods for the deployment
of JCS road infrastructures. Finally, we simulated and analyzed a deployment
optimization method for JCS road infrastructures that complied with the
standard of urban traffic-spot structure placement.

and have long attracted researchers. The recent achievements and the consequent
notoriety of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have also increased its adoption in
trading tasks. RL uses a framework with well-established formal concepts, which
raises its attractiveness in learning profitable trading strategies. However,
RL use without due attention in the financial area can prevent new researchers
from following standards or failing to adopt relevant conceptual guidelines. In
this work, we embrace the seminal RL technical fundamentals, concepts, and
recommendations to perform a unified, theoretically-grounded examination and
comparison of previous research that could serve as a structuring guide for the
field of study. A selection of twenty-nine articles was reviewed under our
classification that considers RL's most common formulations and design patterns
from a large volume of available studies. This classification allowed for
precise inspection of the most relevant aspects regarding data input,
preprocessing, state and action composition, adopted RL techniques, evaluation
setups, and overall results. Our analysis approach organized around fundamental
RL concepts allowed for a clear identification of current system design best
practices, gaps that require further investigation, and promising research
opportunities. Finally, this review attempts to promote the development of this
field of study by facilitating researchers' commitment to standards adherence
and helping them to avoid straying away from the RL constructs' firm ground.

semi-automatically building decision models from eligibility policies for
social services, and present an initial emerging approach to shorten the route
from policy documents to executable, interpretable and standardised decision
models using AI, NLP and Knowledge Graphs. Despite the many open domain
challenges, in this position paper we explore the enormous potential of AI to
assist government agencies and policy experts in scaling the production of both
human-readable and machine executable policy rules, while improving
transparency, interpretability, traceability and accountability of the decision
making.
