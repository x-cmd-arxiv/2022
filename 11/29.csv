candidates, recently discovered from the detection of stellar overdensities in
the Vector Point diagram, by employing extreme deconvolution Gaussian mixture
models. We treated these objects as real open clusters and derived their
fundamental properties with their associated intrinsic dispersions by exploring
the parameter space through the minimization of likelihood functions on
generated synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The intrinsic dispersions
of the resulting ages turned out to be much larger than those usually obtained
for open clusters. Indeed, they resemble those of ages and metallicities of
composite star field populations. We also traced their stellar number density
profiles and mass functions, derived their total masses, Jacobi and tidal
radii, which helped us as criteria while assessing their physical nature as
real open clusters. Because the eleven candidates show a clear gathering of
stars in the proper motion plane and some hint for similar distances, we
concluded that they are possibly sparse groups of stars.

microinjection has been widely applied in the biomedical field. However, the
cognition of cell mechanical property is still inadequate, which greatly limits
the efficiency and success rate of injection. Thus, a new rate-dependent
mechanical model based on membrane theory is proposed for the first time. In
this model, an analytical equilibrium equation between the injection force and
cell deformation is established by considering the speed effect of
microinjection. Different from the traditional membrane-theory-based model, the
elastic coefficient of the constitutive material in the proposed model is
modified as a function of the injection velocity and acceleration, effectively
simulating the influence of speeds on the mechanical responses and providing a
more generalized and practical model. Using this model, other mechanical
responses at different speeds can be also accurately predicted, including the
distribution of membrane tension and stress and the deformed shape. To verify
the validity of the model, numerical simulations and experiments are carried
out. The results show that the proposed model can match the real mechanical
responses well at different injection speeds.

questions, as to how the electrochemical expansion and contraction of PPy acts
on to np-Si pore walls and how the collective motorics of the pore array
emerges from the single-nanopore behavior. An analysis of in operando X-ray
diffraction experiments with micromechanical finite element simulations, based
on a 3D reconstruction of the nanoporous medium by TEM tomography, shows that
the in-plane mechanical response is dominantly isotropic despite the
anisotropic elasticity of the single crystalline host matrix. However, the
structural anisotropy originating from the parallel alignment of the nanopores
lead to significant differences between the in- and out-of-plane
electromechanical response. This response is not describable by a simple 2D
arrangement of parallel cylindrical channels. Rather, the simulations highlight
that the dendritic shape of the Si pore walls, including pore connections
between the main channels, cause complex, inhomogeneous stress-strain fields in
the crystalline host. Time-dependent X-ray scattering on the dynamics of the
actuator properties hint towards the importance of diffusion limitations,
plastic deformation and creep in the nanoconfined polymer upon (counter-)ion
adsorption and desorption, the very pore-scale processes causing the
macroscopic electroactuation. From a more general perspective, our study
demonstrates that the combination of TEM tomography-based micromechanical

atomic interactions and as the spin-orbit coupling strength increases, the
system undergoes a ground state phase transition from states exhibiting a total
in-plane magnetization to those with a perpendicular magnetization along the
$z$ direction. We show that finite frequency, or ac, Hall responses exist in
both phases in the absence of an artificial magnetic field, as a result of
finite inter-band transitions. However, the characteristics of the anomalous
Hall responses are drastically different in these two phases because of the
different symmetries preserved by the corresponding ground states. In
particular, we find a finite dc Hall conductivity in one phase but not the
other. The underlying physical reasons for this are analyzed further by
exploring relations of the dc Hall conductivity to the system's chirality and
Berry curvatures of the Bloch bands. Finally, we discuss an experimental method
of probing the anomalous Hall effect in trapped systems.

shape analysis of shape graphs, and demonstrates them using analysis of complex
data from retinal blood-vessel (RBV) networks. The shape graphs are represented
by a set of nodes and edges (planar articulated curves) connecting some of
these nodes. The goals are to utilize shapes of edges and connectivities and
locations of nodes to: (1) characterize full shapes, (2) quantify shape
differences, and (3) model statistical variability. We develop a mathematical
representation, elastic Riemannian shape metrics, and associated tools for such
statistical analysis. Specifically, we derive tools for shape graph
registration, geodesics, summaries, and shape modeling. Geodesics are
convenient for visualizing optimal deformations, and PCA helps in dimension
reduction and statistical modeling. One key challenge here is comparisons of
shape graphs with vastly different complexities (in number of nodes and edges).
This paper introduces a novel multi-scale representation of shape graphs to
handle this challenge. Using the notions of (1) ``effective resistance"" to
cluster nodes and (2) elastic shape averaging of edge curves, one can reduce
shape graph complexity while maintaining overall structures. This way, we can
compare shape graphs by bringing them to similar complexity. We demonstrate
these ideas on Retinal Blood Vessel (RBV) networks taken from the STARE and
DRIVE databases.

phrase extraction and grounding (PEG). In contrast to the previous
phrase-known-at-test setting, PEG requires a model to extract phrases from text
and locate objects from images simultaneously, which is a more practical
setting in real applications. As phrase extraction can be regarded as a $1$D
text segmentation problem, we formulate PEG as a dual detection problem and
propose a novel DQ-DETR model, which introduces dual queries to probe different
features from image and text for object prediction and phrase mask prediction.
Each pair of dual queries is designed to have shared positional parts but
different content parts. Such a design effectively alleviates the difficulty of
modality alignment between image and text (in contrast to a single query
design) and empowers Transformer decoder to leverage phrase mask-guided
attention to improve performance. To evaluate the performance of PEG, we also
propose a new metric CMAP (cross-modal average precision), analogous to the AP
metric in object detection. The new metric overcomes the ambiguity of Recall@1
in many-box-to-one-phrase cases in phrase grounding. As a result, our PEG
pre-trained DQ-DETR establishes new state-of-the-art results on all visual
grounding benchmarks with a ResNet-101 backbone. For example, it achieves
$91.04\%$ and $83.51\%$ in terms of recall rate on RefCOCO testA and testB with

the dictionary in a linear decomposition method such as NMF, effectively
creating a bijection between the space of dictionary elements and the

dictionary space, guided by the estimated densities. As the initial formulation
was a proof of concept with some practical limitations, we will present several

complexity of the method and its signal decomposition capabilities. As a
testbed for experimental evaluation, we choose the task of frame-level piano
transcription, where the signal is to be decomposed into sources whose activity
is attributed to individual piano notes. To highlight the impact of improved
non-linear modelling of sources, we compare variants of our method to a linear
overcomplete NMF baseline. Experimental results will show that even in the
absence of additional constraints, our models produce increasingly sparse and
precise decompositions, according to two pertinent evaluation measures.

temperature is analyzed as its polarization is progressively decreased, from
full polarization (corresponding to the polaronic limit) down to a critical
polarization when superfluidity sets in. This critical polarization and the
nature of the associated superfluid instability are determined within a fully
self-consistent $t$-matrix approach implemented exactly at zero temperature. In
this way, the polarization-vs-coupling phase diagram at zero temperature is
constructed throughout the whole BCS-BEC crossover. Depending on the coupling
strength of the inter-particle interaction between the two components, the
superfluid instability can be either toward a Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) phase or toward a standard polarized BCS phase. The evolution with
polarization of the quasi-particle parameters in the normal Fermi gas turns out
to be notably different in the two cases. When the instability is toward a
polarized BCS superfluid, quasi-particles in the proximity of the two Fermi
surfaces remain well defined for all polarizations. When the instability is
instead toward an FFLO superfluid, precursor effects become apparent upon
approaching the FFLO quantum critical point (QCP), where the quasi-particle
residues vanish and the effective masses diverge. This behavior leads to a
complete breakdown of the quasi-particle picture characteristic of a Fermi
liquid, similarly to what occurs in heavy-fermion materials at an
antiferromagnetic QCP. At unitarity, the system is further investigated at
finite temperature, making it possible to identify a non-Fermi liquid region in
the temperature-vs-polarization phase diagram associated with the underlying
FFLO QCP.

matrix-valued functions that are analytic and Hermitian on the unit circle $S^1

prove the existence of a decomposition $H(z)=U(z)D(z)U(z)^P$ where, for all $z
\in S^1$, $U(z)$ is unitary, $U(z)^P=U(z)^*$ is its conjugate transpose, and
$D(z)$ is real diagonal; moreover, $U(z)$ and $D(z)$ are analytic functions of
$w=z^{1/N}$ for some positive integer $N$, and $U(z)^P$ is the so-called
para-Hermitian conjugate of $U(z)$. This generalizes the celebrated theorem of
Rellich for matrix-valued functions that are analytic and Hermitian on the real

para-Hermitian matrices whose entries are Puiseux series (that is, on the unit
circle they are analytic in $w$ but possibly not in $z$). Finally, we discuss
the implications of our results on the singular value decomposition of a matrix

  metrics on the classical domains","Accepted for publication in Science China-Mathematics",,,,"math.DG math.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a class of holomorphic invariant metrics is introduced on the
irreducible classical domains of type I-IV, which are strongly pseudoconvex
complex Finsler metrics in the strict sense of M. Abate and G. Patrizio[2].
These metrics are of particular interest in several complex variables since
they are holomorphic invariant complex Finsler metrics found so far in
literature which enjoy good regularity as well as strong pseudoconvexity and
can be explicitly expressed so as to admit differential geometric studies. They
are, however, not necessarily Hermitian quadratic as that of the Bergman
metrics. These metrics are explicitly constructed via deformation of the
corresponding Bergman metric on the irreducible classical domains of type I-IV,
respectively, and they are all proved to be complete Kahler-Berwald metrics.
They enjoy very similar curvature properties as that of the Bergman metric on
the irreducible classical domains, namely their holomorphic sectional
curvatures are bounded between two negative constants, and their holomorphic
bisectional curvatures are always non positive and bounded below by negative
constants, respectively. From the viewpoint of complex analysis, these metrics
are analogues of Bergman metrics in complex Finsler geometry which do not
necessarily have Hermitian quadratic restrictions in the viewpoint of S.-S.

Mueller matrix (MM)-valued polarized bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (pBRDF). A pBRDF is parameterized by 16 degrees of freedom that depend
upon scattering geometry. A triple degenerate (TD) MM assumption reduces the
degrees of freedom to eight: one for reflectance, six for non-depolarizing
properties, and one for depolarization. When the non-depolarizing dominant
process is known or assumed (e.g. Fresnel reflection), the degrees of freedom
are further reduced to two. For a given material, if the TD model is
appropriate and the dominant non-depolarizing process is known, then these two
degrees of freedom can be estimated from as few as two polarimetric
measurements. Thus, the MM can be extrapolated from a reduced number of
measurements. The primary contribution of this work is the development and
demonstration of a linear estimator for a MM's dominant eigenvalue (i.e. single
depolarization parameter) which requires fewer measurements than a full MM
reconstruction. MM extrapolations from single snapshot acquisitions with a Sony
Triton 5.0MP Polarization Camera are performed at 30 acquisition geometries and
two wavelengths on an ensemble of LEGO bricks treated to have varying surface

comprehensive investigation of electronic structure, magnetic properties and
possible structural distortion of magnetic kagome metal FeGe. We estimate the
magnetic parameters including Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interactions, and find that the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_{1}$
dominates over the others, while the magnetic interactions between nearest
kagome layers favors antiferromagnetic. The N\'{e}el temperature $T_{N}$ and
Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta _{CW}$ are successfully reproduced, and the
calculated magnetic anisotropy energy is also in consistent with the
experiment. However, these reasonable Heisenberg interactions and magnetic
anisotropy cannot explain the double cone magnetic transition, and the DM
interactions, which even exist in the centrosymmetric materials, can result in
this small magnetic cone angle. Unfortunately, due to the crystal symmetry of
the high-temperature structure, the net contribution of DM interactions to
double cone magnetic structure is absent. Based on the experimental $2\times
2\times 2$ supercell, we thus explore the subgroups of the parent phase. Group
theoretical analysis reveals that there are 68 different distortions, and only
four of them (space group $P622$ or $P6_{3}22$) without inversion and mirror
symmetry thus can explain the low-temperature magnetic structure. Furthermore,
we suggest that these four proposed CDW phases can be identified by using Raman
spectroscopy. Since DM interactions are very sensitive to small atomic
displacements and symmetry restrictions, we believe that symmetry analysis is
an effective method to reveal the interplay of delicate structural distortions
and complex magnetic configurations.

directly to style images in pixel space, generating aligned portrait-style
image pairs with identical landmarks, which closes the geometric gaps between
two domains. Secondly, adversarial learning maps the textures and colors of
portrait images to the style domain. Finally, geometric aware cycle consistency
preserves the content and identity information unchanged, and deformation
invariant constraint suppresses artifacts and distortions. Qualitative and
quantitative comparison validate our method outperforms existing methods, and
experiments proof our method could be trained with limited style examples (100

Hall bar for DC current densities reaching 0.67 A/m. The various phenomena and
the boundaries between the phenomena are captured together in a two-dimensional
differential resistivity map as a function of magnetic field (up to 250 mT) and
DC current. This map, which resembles a phase diagram, demarcate distinct
regions dominated by Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations (and phase inversion
of these oscillations) around zero DC current; negative magnetoresistance and a
double-peak feature (both ballistic in origin) around zero field; and Hall
field-induced resistance oscillations (HIROs) radiating out from the origin.
From a detailed analysis of the data near zero field, we show that increasing
the DC current suppresses the electron-electron scattering length that drives a
growing hydrodynamic contribution to both the differential longitudinal and
transverse (Hall) resistivities. Our approach to induce hydrodynamics with DC
current differs from the more usual approach of changing the temperature. We
also find a significant (factor of two to four) difference between the quantum
lifetime extracted from SdH oscillations, and the quantum lifetime extracted

ensemble with O($a$)-improved Wilson quarks and physical up, down and strange
quark masses. The pion quasiparticle turns out to be significantly lighter than
the zero-temperature pion mass, even though the corresponding static
correlation length is shorter. We perform a quantitative comparison of our
findings to predictions of chiral perturbation theory. Among several order
parameters for chiral symmetry restoration, we compute the difference of the
vector- and axial-vector time-dependent correlators and find it to be reduced
by a factor $\sim2/3$ as compared to its vacuum counterpart.

clinical data sets to identify the undergoing molecular processes taking place
throughout the evolution of various cancers. Numerous Machine Learning and
statistical models have been designed and trained to analyze these types of

sourced information streams has not been extensively studied. To better
integrate these data sets and generate meaningful representations that can
ultimately be leveraged for cancer detection tasks could lead to giving
well-suited treatments to patients. Hence, we propose a novel learning pipeline
comprising three steps - the integration of cancer data modalities as graphs,
followed by the application of Graph Neural Networks in an unsupervised setting
to generate lower-dimensional embeddings from the combined data, and finally
feeding the new representations on a cancer sub-type classification model for
evaluation. The graph construction algorithms are described in-depth as
METABRIC does not store relationships between the patient modalities, with a
discussion of their influence over the quality of the generated embeddings. We
also present the models used to generate the lower-latent space

demonstrate that the characteristics of the underlying data, such as homophily
levels, greatly influence the performance of the pipeline, which ranges between
51\% to 98\% accuracy on artificial data, and 13\% and 80\% on METABRIC. This

high-dimensional binary classification problem with heterogeneous covariance

training data onto a direction vector have exactly two distinct values, one for
each class. This first data piling phenomenon occurs for any data when the
dimension $p$ is larger than the sample size $n$. We show that the second data
piling phenomenon, which refers to a data piling of independent test data, can
occur in an asymptotic context where $p$ grows while $n$ is fixed. We further
show that a second maximal data piling direction, which gives an asymptotic
maximal distance between the two piles of independent test data, can be
obtained by projecting the first maximal data piling direction onto the
nullspace of the common leading eigenspace. This observation provides a
theoretical explanation for the phenomenon where the optimal ridge parameter
can be negative in the context of high-dimensional linear classification. Based
on the second data piling phenomenon, we propose various linear classification
rules which ensure perfect classification of high-dimension low-sample-size

degeneracy at the Fermi energy, making such reference system metals. Yet, many
ABO3 oxide perovskites with a magnetic 3d B-atom are, in fact, insulators both
below and above the Neel temperature. These inconsistencies between
experimental observation and expectation have been traditionally resolved by
invoking degeneracy-breaking physics based largely on high-order electron
effects, such as strong interelectronic correlation (the Mott mechanism). Such
explanations generally utilize the highest symmetry structure, considering
microscopic degrees of freedom (m-DOF) as largely passive spectators. Yet, it
has long been known that ABO3 perovskites can manifest an arrangement of m-DOFs
in the form of octahedral tilting, bond dimerization, Jahn-Teller distortions,
and ordering of local magnetic moments as part of the stabilizing intrinsic
symmetry. Such m-DOFs are seen both by local experimental probes and
theoretically in total energy minimization of its Born-Oppenheimer state. While
such local structural and magnetic symmetry breaking motifs were often
considered to be the reason for gapping of the reference system below the
transition into Para phases, it was also often thought that above the
transition those local motifs might vanish, requiring a different mechanism for
gapping - such as strong correlation. Here we examine if such intrinsic
structural and magnetic symmetry breaking might systematically explain the
formation of insulating band gaps both below and above the magnetic transition
and account at the same time for specific and non-accidental exceptions of the
absence of gaping in some compounds, such as SrVO3.

techniques and solving the approximate set membership problem, have recently
been introduced with the aim of enhancing the performance of standard Bloom
Filters, with special focus on space occupancy. Unlike in the classical case,
the ""complexity"" of the data used to build the filter might heavily impact on
its performance. Therefore, here we propose the first in-depth analysis, to the
best of our knowledge, for the performance assessment of a given Learned Bloom
Filter, in conjunction with a given classifier, on a dataset of a given
classification complexity. Indeed, we propose a novel methodology, supported by
software, for designing, analyzing and implementing Learned Bloom Filters in
function of specific constraints on their multi-criteria nature (that is,
constraints involving space efficiency, false positive rate, and reject time).
Our experiments show that the proposed methodology and the supporting software
are valid and useful: we find out that only two classifiers have desirable
properties in relation to problems with different data complexity, and,
interestingly, none of them has been considered so far in the literature. We
also experimentally show that the Sandwiched variant of Learned Bloom filters
is the most robust to data complexity and classifier performance variability,
as well as those usually having smaller reject times. The software can be
readily used to test new Learned Bloom Filter proposals, which can be compared
with the best ones identified here.

world: An AI agent situated in the physical world and interacting with objects
often needs to reason about positions of and relations between objects; and as
soon as the agent plans its actions to solve a task, it needs to consider the
temporal aspect (e.g., what actions to perform over time). Spatio-temporal
knowledge, however, is required beyond interacting with the physical world, and
is also often transferred to the abstract world of concepts through analogies
and metaphors (e.g., ""a threat that is hanging over our heads""). As spatial and
temporal reasoning is ubiquitous, different attempts have been made to
integrate this into AI systems. In the area of knowledge representation,
spatial and temporal reasoning has been largely limited to modeling objects and
relations and developing reasoning methods to verify statements about objects
and relations. On the other hand, neural network researchers have tried to
teach models to learn spatial relations from data with limited reasoning
capabilities. Bridging the gap between these two approaches in a mutually
beneficial way could allow us to tackle many complex real-world problems, such
as natural language processing, visual question answering, and semantic image
segmentation. In this chapter, we view this integration problem from the
perspective of Neuro-Symbolic AI. Specifically, we propose a synergy between
logical reasoning and machine learning that will be grounded on spatial and
temporal knowledge. Describing some successful applications, remaining
challenges, and evaluation datasets pertaining to this direction is the main
topic of this contribution.

droplet icing and jumping. The joint contribution of the top-down vaporization

vaporization-compression-detaching dynamics of the freezing droplets. We
delineate the jumping velocity of the icing droplet by analyzing droplet

obtain the effective interactions, we use the exact diagonalization of the

perturbation expansion in terms of the Kondo exchange with the exact
calculation of the interaction, treating the local spins classically. We find
that perturbation theory works well even beyond the regime where the relevant
figure of merit, the ratio between the exchange $J$ and the hopping $t$, is

analyse the interplay between the symmetry of the different terms of the
interaction (Heisenberg, Ising, and Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya (DM)), the
Fermi-surface topology, and the crystallographic direction in which the
impurities are placed. We show that the indirect exchange along the armchair
direction is actually Heisenberg-like, due to the reflection symmetry of the

the TESS and WFC3 data provides evidence for molecular absorption by a
hydrogen-rich atmosphere at 4-sigma significance relative to a featureless

H2O, which is favoured at 3-sigma significance. When retrieving on the WFC3

memorize whole examples rather than separating structures from contents. We
propose two techniques to address these two issues respectively: Mutual
Exclusivity Training that prevents the model from producing seen generations
when facing novel, unseen examples via an unlikelihood-based loss; and
prim2primX data augmentation that automatically diversifies the arguments of
every syntactic function to prevent memorizing and provide a compositional
inductive bias without exposing test-set data. Combining these two techniques,
we show substantial empirical improvements using standard sequence-to-sequence

laminar flow takes the form of oblique, spatially-intermittent turbulent
structures. In plane Couette flow, these emerge from uniform turbulence via a
spatiotemporal intermittent process in which localised quasi-laminar gaps
randomly nucleate and disappear. For slightly lower Reynolds numbers, spatially
periodic and approximately stationary turbulent-laminar patterns predominate.
The statistics of quasi-laminar regions, including the distributions of space
and time scales and their Reynolds number dependence, are analysed. A smooth,
but marked transition is observed between uniform turbulence and flow with
intermittent quasi-laminar gaps, whereas the transition from gaps to regular
patterns is more gradual. Wavelength selection in these patterns is analysed
via numerical simulations in oblique domains of various sizes. Via lifetime
measurements in minimal domains, and a wavelet-based analysis of wavelength
predominance in a large domain, we quantify the existence and non-linear
stability of a pattern as a function of wavelength and Reynolds number. We
report that the preferred wavelength maximises the energy and dissipation of
the large-scale flow along laminar-turbulent interfaces. This optimal behaviour
is primarily due to the advective nature of the large-scale flow, with
turbulent fluctuations playing only a secondary role.

in a wide range of NLP tasks. However, fine-tuning the whole model is parameter
inefficient as it always yields an entirely new model for each task. Currently,
many research works propose to only fine-tune a small portion of the parameters
while keeping most of the parameters shared across different tasks. These
methods achieve surprisingly good performance and are shown to be more stable
than their corresponding fully fine-tuned counterparts. However, such kind of
methods is still not well understood. Some natural questions arise: How does
the parameter sparsity lead to promising performance? Why is the model more
stable than the fully fine-tuned models? How to choose the tunable parameters?
In this paper, we first categorize the existing methods into random approaches,
rule-based approaches, and projection-based approaches based on how they choose
which parameters to tune. Then, we show that all of the methods are actually
sparse fine-tuned models and conduct a novel theoretical analysis of them. We
indicate that the sparsity is actually imposing a regularization on the
original model by controlling the upper bound of the stability. Such stability
leads to better generalization capability which has been empirically observed
in a lot of recent research works. Despite the effectiveness of sparsity
grounded by our theory, it still remains an open problem of how to choose the
tunable parameters. To better choose the tunable parameters, we propose a novel
Second-order Approximation Method (SAM) which approximates the original problem
with an analytically solvable optimization function. The tunable parameters are
determined by directly optimizing the approximation function. The experimental
results show that our proposed SAM model outperforms many strong baseline
models and it also verifies our theoretical analysis.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are known to scale poorly to
environments with many available actions, requiring numerous samples to learn
an optimal policy. The traditional approach of considering the same fixed
action space in every possible state implies that the agent must understand,
while also learning to maximize its reward, to ignore irrelevant actions such
as $\textit{inapplicable actions}$ (i.e. actions that have no effect on the
environment when performed in a given state). Knowing this information can help
reduce the sample complexity of RL algorithms by masking the inapplicable
actions from the policy distribution to only explore actions relevant to
finding an optimal policy. While this technique has been formalized for quite
some time within the Automated Planning community with the concept of
precondition in the STRIPS language, RL algorithms have never formally taken
advantage of this information to prune the search space to explore. This is
typically done in an ad-hoc manner with hand-crafted domain logic added to the
RL algorithm. In this paper, we propose a more systematic approach to introduce
this knowledge into the algorithm. We (i) standardize the way knowledge can be
manually specified to the agent; and (ii) present a new framework to
autonomously learn the partial action model encapsulating the precondition of
an action jointly with the policy. We show experimentally that learning
inapplicable actions greatly improves the sample efficiency of the algorithm by
providing a reliable signal to mask out irrelevant actions. Moreover, we
demonstrate that thanks to the transferability of the knowledge acquired, it
can be reused in other tasks and domains to make the learning process more
efficient.

Ising critical line that we find to be in the tri-critical Ising universality

The study of moir\'e materials has so far been limited to structures comprising
no more than a few vdW sheets, since a moir\'e pattern localized to a single
two-dimensional interface is generally assumed to be incapable of appreciably
modifying the properties of a bulk three-dimensional crystal. Layered
semimetals such as graphite offer a unique platform to challenge this paradigm,
owing to distinctive properties arising from their nearly-compensated electron
and hole bulk doping. Here, we perform transport measurements of dual-gated
devices constructed by slightly rotating a monolayer graphene sheet atop a thin
bulk graphite crystal. We find that the moir\'e potential transforms the
electronic properties of the entire bulk graphitic thin film. At zero and small
magnetic fields, transport is mediated by a combination of gate-tunable moir\'e
and graphite surface states, as well as coexisting semimetallic bulk states
that do not respond to gating. At high field, the moir\'e potential hybridizes
with the graphitic bulk states owing to the unique properties of the two lowest
Landau bands of graphite. These Landau bands facilitate the formation of a
single quasi-two-dimensional hybrid structure in which the moir\'e and bulk
graphite states are inextricably mixed. Our results establish twisted
graphene-graphite as the first in a new class of mixed-dimensional moir\'e

However, in practice, each individual behavior policy that generates
multi-agent joint trajectories usually has a different level of how well it

policies. In the cooperative game with global reward, one agent learned by
existing offline MARL often inherits this random policy, jeopardizing the

the credit to each agent through a differentiable key-value memory mechanism in

conservatively train their policies with a graph attention network (GAT) based

A
range of numerical works have separately investigated how chemistry and
diffusion effects, as well as magnetic fields and their structure impact the
gas dynamics of the filament. However, non-ideal effects have hardly been
explored thus far. We investigate how non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
effects, combined with a simplified chemical model affect the evolution and
accretion of a star-forming filament. We modeled an accreting self-gravitating
turbulent filament using lemongrab, a one-dimensional (1D) non-ideal MHD code
that includes chemistry. We explore the influence of non-ideal MHD, the
orientation and strength of the magnetic field, and the cosmic ray ionization
rate, on the evolution of the filament, with particular focus on the width and
accretion rate. We find that the filament width and the accretion rate are
determined by the magnetic field properties, including the initial strength,
the coupling with the gas controlled by the cosmic ray ionization rate, and the
orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the accretion flow direction.
Increasing the cosmic-ray ionization rate leads to a behavior closer to that of
ideal MHD, reducing the magnetic pressure support and, hence, damping the
accretion efficiency with a consequent broadening of the filament width. For
the same reason, we obtained a narrower width and a larger accretion rate when
we reduced the initial magnetic field strength. Overall, while these factors
affect the final results by approximately a factor of~2, removing the non-ideal
MHD effects results in a much greater variation (up to a factor of~7). The
inclusion of non-ideal MHD effects and the cosmic-ray ionization is crucial for
the study of self-gravitating filaments and in determining critical observable
quantities, such as the filament width and accretion rate.

from its true value. As stated in recent FDA guidance on adaptive designs, it
is desirable to report estimates of treatment effects that reduce or remove
this bias. However, it may be unclear which of the available estimators are
preferable, and their use remains rare in practice. This paper is the second in
a two-part series that studies the issue of bias in point estimation for
adaptive trials. Part I provided a methodological review of approaches to
remove or reduce the potential bias in point estimation for adaptive designs.
In part II, we discuss how bias can affect standard estimators and assess the
negative impact this can have. We review current practice for reporting point
estimates and illustrate the computation of different estimators using a real
adaptive trial example (including code), which we use as a basis for a
simulation study. We show that while on average the values of these estimators
can be similar, for a particular trial realisation they can give noticeably
different values for the estimated treatment effect. Finally, we propose
guidelines for researchers around the choice of estimators and the reporting of
estimates following an adaptive design. The issue of bias should be considered
throughout the whole lifecycle of an adaptive design, with the estimation
strategy pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan. When available,
unbiased or bias-reduced estimates are to be preferred.

VLBA observing epochs at 15 GHz from January 1996 through August 2019, with
some additional archival VLBA data reduced by us. We employed a stacking
procedure and constructed maps of (i) standard deviation of fractional
polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA) over epochs as the
measure of variability and (ii) median polarization degree to quantify typical
values in time. The distributions of these values along and across the jet were
analysed for the whole sample for the first time. We found that core EVPA
variability is typically higher than that of the jet, presumably due to
component blending and outflow bends in the core. The BL Lacertae object cores
have lower EVPA variability, compared to that of quasars, possibly due to lower
Faraday rotation measure, suggesting a stronger ordered magnetic field
component. The EVPA becomes more stable down the jet. Most of the sources
showing this trend have a time coverage of more than 12 years and at least 15
epochs. The possible cause could be the increase of stability in the magnetic
field direction, reflecting an increase in the fraction of the magnetic field
that is ordered. There are no significant optical-class-dependent or

electronic Hamiltonians to make the wavefunction of metastable electronic
states square-integrable. This makes the electronic structure problem of
electronic resonances comparable to that of electronic bound states, thus
reducing the complexity of the problem. CAPs depend on two types of parameters:
the coupling parameter $\eta$ and a set of spatial parameters which define the
onset of the CAP. It has been a common practice over the years to minimize the
CAP perturbation on the physical electronic Hamiltonian by running an
$\eta-$trajectory, whereby one fixes the spatial parameters and varies $\eta$.
The optimal $\eta$ is chosen according to the minimum log-velocity criterion.
But the effectiveness of an $\eta-$trajectory strongly depends on the values of
the fixed spatial parameters.
  In this work, we propose a more general criterion, called the
$\xi-$criterion, which allows one to minimize any CAP parameter, including the
CAP spatial parameters. Indeed, we show that fixing $\eta$ and varying the
spatial parameters according to a scheme (i.e., running a spatial trajectory)
is a more efficient and reliable way of minimizing the CAP perturbations (which
is assessed using the $\xi-$criterion). We illustrate the method by determining
the resonance energy and width of the temporary anion of dinitrogen, at the
Hartree-Fock and EOM-EA-CCSD levels, using two different types of CAPs: the
box- and the smooth Voronoi-CAPs.

with many fields of mathematics such as dynamical systems, statistics and uses

models and ergodic theory defining the concepts of log-ergodic processes and
ergodic maker operator. Using log-ergodic processes we introduce some
stochastic models that are capable of being useful in mathematical finance and
it is possible to study the properties of some financial data having mean

objective features -- those we are used to at macroscopic scales -- from
quantum properties at the microscopic level. The interaction of a quantum
system with its surroundings redundantly proliferates information to many parts
of the environment, turning it accessible and objective to different observers.
But given that one cannot probe the quantum system directly, only its
environment, how to witness whether an unknown quantum property can be deemed
objective or not? Here we propose a probabilistic framework to analyze this
question and show that objectivity implies a Bell-like inequality. Among
several other results, we show quantum violations of this inequality, a
device-independent proof of the non-objectivity of quantum correlations that
give rise to the phenomenon we name ""collective hallucination"": observers
probing distinct parts of the environment can agree upon their measurement
outcome of a given observable but such outcome can be totally uncorrelated from
the property of the quantum system that fixed observable should be probing. We
also implement an appealing photonic experiment where the temporal degree of
freedom of photons is the quantum system of interest, while their polarization
acts as the environment. Employing a fully black-box approach, we achieve the
violation of a Bell inequality, thus certifying the non-objectivity of the
underlying quantum dynamics in a fully device-independent framework.

independence for a collection of multivariate random variables. Using the
emerging theory of optimal transport (OT) based multivariate ranks, we propose
a distribution-free test for multivariate joint independence. Towards this we
introduce the notion of rank joint distance covariance (RJdCov), the
higher-order rank analogue of the celebrated distance covariance measure, that
captures the dependencies among all the subsets of the variables. The RJdCov
can be easily estimated from the data without any moment assumptions and the
associated test for joint independence is universally consistent. We can
calibrate the test without any knowledge of the (unknown) marginal
distributions (due to the distribution-free property), both asymptotically and
in finite samples. In addition to being distribution-free and universally
consistent, the proposed test is also statistically efficient, that is, it has
non-trivial asymptotic (Pitman) efficiency. We demonstrate this by computing
the limiting local power of the test for both mixture alternatives and joint
Konijn alternatives. We also use the RJdCov measure to develop a method for
independent component analysis (ICA) that is easy to implement and robust to
outliers and contamination. Extensive simulations are performed to illustrate
the efficacy of the proposed test in comparison to other existing methods.
Finally, we apply the proposed test to learn the higher-order dependence
structure among different US industries based on stock prices.

dark matter (DM), and the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe in a
$Z_3$-symmetric complex singlet scalar extended type-II seesaw model. The
complex singlet scalar plays the role of DM. Analyzing the thermal history of
the model, we identify the region of the parameter space that can generate a
first-order electroweak phase transition (FOEWPT) in the early Universe, and
the resulting stochastic gravitational waves (GW) can be detected at future
space/ground-based GW experiments. First, we find that light triplet scalars do
favor an FOEWPT. In our study, we choose the type-II seesaw part of the
parameter space in such a way that light triplet scalars, especially the doubly
charged ones, evade the strong bounds from their canonical searches at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the relevant part of the parameter space,
where FOEWPT can happen only due to strong SM doublet-triplet interactions, is
in tension with the SM-like Higgs decay to a pair of photons, which has already
excluded the bulk of this parameter space. On the other hand, the latest
spin-independent DM direct detection constraints from XENON-1T and PANDA-4T
eliminate a significant amount of parameter space relevant for the dark sector
assisted FOEWPT scenarios, and it is only possible when the complex scalar DM
is significantly underabundant. In short, we conclude from our analysis that
the absence of new physics at the HL-LHC and/or various DM experiments in the
near future will severely limit the prospects of detecting a stochastic GW at
future GW experiments and will exclude the possibility of electroweak
baryogenesis within this model.

accurate yet efficient mirror detection, HetNet follows an effective
architecture that obtains specific information at different stages to detect
mirrors. We further propose a multi-orientation intensity-based contrasted

HetNet, to predict potential mirror regions by low-level understandings and
analyze semantic logic in scenarios by high-level understandings, respectively.

there are additional meta-data labels (such as group labels), denoted by $z$,
that can account for such changes in the distribution. In particular, we assume
that the prior distribution $p(y, z)$, which models the dependence between the
class label $y$ and the ""nuisance"" factors $z$, may change across domains,
either due to a change in the correlation between these terms, or a change in
one of their marginals. However, we assume that the generative model for
features $p(x|y, z)$ is invariant across domains. We note that this corresponds
to an expanded version of the widely used ""label shift"" assumption, where the
labels now also include the nuisance factors $z$. Based on this observation, we
propose a test-time label shift correction that adapts to changes in the joint
distribution $p(y, z)$ using EM applied to unlabeled samples from the target
domain distribution, $p_t(x)$. Importantly, we are able to avoid fitting a
generative model $p(x|y,z)$, and merely need to reweight the outputs of a
discriminative model $p_s(y,z|x)$ trained on the source distribution. We
evaluate our method, which we call ""Test-Time Label-Shift Adaptation"" (TTLSA),

keV electrons with good pitch-angle and energy resolution. EMIC wave-driven
precipitation exhibits a distinct signature in energy-spectrograms of the
precipitating-to-trapped flux ratio: peaks at 0.5 MeV which are abrupt (bursty)
with significant substructure (occasionally down to sub-second timescale).
Multiple ELFIN passes over the same MLT sector allow us to study the spatial
and temporal evolution of the EMIC wave - electron interaction region. Using
two years of ELFIN data, we assemble a statistical database of 50 events of
strong EMIC wave-driven precipitation. Most reside at L=5-7 at dusk, while a
smaller subset exists at L=8-12 at post-midnight. The energies of the
peak-precipitation ratio and of the half-peak precipitation ratio (our proxy
for the minimum resonance energy) exhibit an L-shell dependence in good
agreement with theoretical estimates based on prior statistical observations of
EMIC wave power spectra. The precipitation ratio's spectral shape for the most
intense events has an exponential falloff away from the peak (i.e., on either
side of 1.45 MeV). It too agrees well with quasi-linear diffusion theory based
on prior statistics of wave spectra. Sub-MeV electron precipitation observed
concurrently with strong EMIC wave-driven 1MeV precipitation has a spectral
shape that is consistent with efficient pitch-angle scattering down to 200-300
keV by much less intense higher frequency EMIC waves. These results confirm the
critical role of EMIC waves in driving relativistic electron losses. Nonlinear

feature-level fusion and only consider short-range HD map generation, limiting
their deployment to realistic autonomous driving applications. In this paper,
we focus on the task of building the HD maps in both short ranges, i.e., within
30 m, and also predicting long-range HD maps up to 90 m, which is required by
downstream path planning and control tasks to improve the smoothness and safety

modeling. To our surprise, we find that our formulation leads to policies that
can outperform existing offline RL approaches across standard benchmarks. By
modeling a policy as a return-conditional diffusion model, we illustrate how we
may circumvent the need for dynamic programming and subsequently eliminate many
of the complexities that come with traditional offline RL. We further
demonstrate the advantages of modeling policies as conditional diffusion models
by considering two other conditioning variables: constraints and skills.
Conditioning on a single constraint or skill during training leads to behaviors
at test-time that can satisfy several constraints together or demonstrate a
composition of skills. Our results illustrate that conditional generative
modeling is a powerful tool for decision-making.

capacity for in-context learning. They can construct new predictors from

further parameter updates. We investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based
in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by
encoding smaller models in their activations, and updating these implicit
models as new examples appear in the context. Using linear regression as a
prototypical problem, we offer three sources of evidence for this hypothesis.
First, we prove by construction that transformers can implement learning
algorithms for linear models based on gradient descent and closed-form ridge
regression. Second, we show that trained in-context learners closely match the
predictors computed by gradient descent, ridge regression, and exact
least-squares regression, transitioning between different predictors as
transformer depth and dataset noise vary, and converging to Bayesian estimators
for large widths and depths. Third, we present preliminary evidence that
in-context learners share algorithmic features with these predictors: learners'
late layers non-linearly encode weight vectors and moment matrices. These
results suggest that in-context learning is understandable in algorithmic
terms, and that (at least in the linear case) learners may rediscover standard

stacking analysis and detected an OVII absorption line toward the sightline of
a luminous quasar, hinting that the missing baryons may reside in the WHIM. To
explore how the properties of the OVII absorption line depend on feedback
physics, we compare the observational results with predictions obtained from

CAMELS consists of cosmological simulations with state-of-the-art supernova
(SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback models from the IllustrisTNG and
SIMBA simulations, with varying strengths. We find that the simulated OVII
column densities are higher in the outskirts of galaxies than in the
large-scale WHIM, but they are consistently lower than those obtained in the
Chandra observations, for all feedback runs. We establish that the OVII
distribution is primarily sensitive to changes in the SN feedback prescription,
whereas changes in the AGN feedback prescription have minimal impact. We also
find significant differences in the OVII column densities between the
IllustrisTNG and SIMBA runs. We conclude that the tension between the observed

feedback models implemented in CAMELS.

direct imaging detections lie close to the canonical 5$\sigma$ threshold, even

$15^{\prime\prime}$, which corresponds to $0.3 - 1.8~\rm kpc$. We find that the
ratio of the SFE in the bar to that in the disk was systematically lower than
unity (typically $0.6-0.8$), which means that the star formation in the bar is
systematically suppressed. Our results are inconsistent with similar recent
statistical studies that reported that SFE tends to be independent of galactic
structures. This inconsistency can be attributed to the differences in the
definition of the bar region, spatial resolution, $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, and sample

encounter superpositions of causal orders. In light of recent work on quantum
reference frames, which reveals that the superposition of locations, momenta,
and other properties can depend on the choice of reference frame or coordinate
system, the question arises whether this also holds true for superpositions of
causal orders. Here, we provide a negative answer to this question for quantum
diffeomorphisms. First, we provide an unambiguous definition of causal order
between two events in terms of worldline coincidences and the proper time of a
third particle. Then, we show that superpositions of causal order defined as
such cannot be rendered definite even through the most general class of
coordinate transformations - quantum-controlled, independent diffeomorphisms in
each branch. Finally, based on our results, we connect the information

whose HI (neutral gas) morphology appears to follow an evolutionary sequence of
three phases, with gas initially confined to galaxies, then significant amounts
spread throughout the intra-group medium, and finally with almost no gas
remaining in the galaxies themselves. The HI deficiency of HCGs is expected to
increase as the HI morphological phase progresses along this sequence,
potentially making it a useful proxy for evolutionary phase. We test this
hypothesis for the first time with a large sample of 38 HCGs with VLA HI
observations that are uniformly reduced and analysed with a purpose-built
pipeline. However, we find little evidence that HI deficiency can be used as a
proxy for the evolutionary phase of a HCG in either of the first two phases,
with the distribution of HI deficiency being consistent in both, although it
does greatly increase in the third phase. This appears to be the result to
three factors: a) there is already a broad range of HI deficiencies in Phase 1
HCGs, possibly due to their differing locations relative to large scale
structures; b) the timescale for major interactions and morphological changes
is, in general, considerably shorter than the timescale for the destruction or
consumption of HI gas; and c) some groups have their HI content rejuvenated by
the late addition of a new gas-rich member (for which we added a new sub-phase,
3c, to the established evolutionary sequence). Finally, across all HCGs
studied, we identify only a few cases where there is strong evidence for the
existence of a previously proposed diffuse HI component in the intra-group
medium, which might be detectable with improved observations. This work was
completed with considerable attention paid to scientific reproducibility, and

Medium (ISM), in particular the formation of molecular clouds and thus stars.
However, computationally it is among the most difficult tasks to include in
astrophysical simulations, because of the typically high (>40) number of
reactions, the short evolutionary timescales (about $10^4$ times less than the
ISM dynamical time) and the characteristic non-linearity and stiffness of the
associated Ordinary Differential Equations system (ODEs). In this proof of
concept work, we show that Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a viable
alternative to traditional ODE time integrators for stiff thermo-chemical
systems, i.e. up to molecular hydrogen formation (9 species and 46 reactions).
Testing different chemical networks in a wide range of densities ($-2< \log
n/{\rm cm}^{-3}< 3$) and temperatures ($1 < \log T/{\rm K}< 5$), we find that a
basic architecture can give a comfortable convergence only for simplified
chemical systems: to properly capture the sudden chemical and thermal
variations a Deep Galerkin Method is needed. Once trained ($\sim 10^3$ GPUhr),
the PINN well reproduces the strong non-linear nature of the solutions (errors
$\lesssim 10\%$) and can give speed-ups up to a factor of $\sim 200$ with
respect to traditional ODE solvers. Further, the latter have completion times
that vary by about $\sim 30\%$ for different initial $n$ and $T$, while the
PINN method gives negligible variations. Both the speed-up and the potential
improvement in load balancing imply that PINN-powered simulations are a very
palatable way to solve complex chemical calculation in astrophysical and
cosmological problems.

increasing the stellar mass ratio of a $z\approx2$ merger from 1:25 to 1:2,

environment. We find markedly different morphologies at $z=0$ following this
change in early history, with a growing merger resulting in increasingly

galaxies show a radially-biased population of inner halo stars like the
Milky-Way's GSE which, surprisingly, has a similar magnitude, age, $\rm [Fe/H]$

compensated by a larger population formed in an earlier merger-driven starburst

Hamiltonians whose couplings decay with a power-law exponent $\alpha$, there
has been no systematic study for a free-fermion symmetry class. We introduce a
technique for solving gapped, translationally invariant models in the 1D BDI

winding invariant, bulk topological string-order parameters and a complete
solution of the edge modes. The physics of these chains is elucidated by
studying a complex function determined by the couplings of the Hamiltonian: in
contrast to the short-range case where edge modes are associated to roots of
this function, we find that they are now associated to singularities. A
remarkable consequence is that the finite-size splitting of the edge modes
depends on the topological winding number, which can be used as a probe of the
latter. We furthermore generalise these results by (i) identifying a family of
BDI chains with $\alpha<1$ where our results still hold, and (ii) showing that
gapless symmetry-protected topological chains can have topological invariants
and edge modes when $\alpha -1$ exceeds the dynamical critical exponent.

Photons can be down scattered (Compton scattering) or up scattered (inverse

rays. Computations of inverse Compton emission typically adopts an isotropic or
an ultrarelativistic assumption to simplify the calculation, which makes them
unable to broadcast the formula to the whole phase space of source particles.
In view of this, we develop a numerical scheme to compute the interactions
between anisotropic photons and electrons without taking ultrarelativistic
approximations. Compared to the ultrarelativistic limit, our exact results show
major deviations when target photons are down scattered or when they possess
energy comparable to source electrons. We also consider two test cases of
high-energy inverse Compton emission to validate our results in the
ultrarelativistic limit. In general, our formalism can be applied to cases of
anisotropic electron-photon scattering in various energy regimes, and for
computing the polarizations of the scattered photons.

and two prescriptions for electron-capture supernovae. In contrast to the case
of binary-black hole mergers, for a neutron star companion of 1.4 solar masses,
all binary neutron star mergers are formed following a common envelope phase,
while for a neutron star mass of 2.0 solar masses we identify a small subset of
mergers following only stable mass transfer if the neutron star receives a
large natal kick. Regardless of neutron star companion mass, we find that large
supernova natal kicks are favored in the formation of binary neutron star

realised in a limited region of parameter space to avoid runaway. We show that
in the regime where inflationary fluctuations dominate over the classical
slow-roll, the ""stochastic misalignment"" of the field due to fluctuations can
be large. We study the evolution of the relaxion after inflation, including the
high-temperature scenario, in which the barriers of the potential shrink and
destabilise temporarily the local minimum. We open new regions of parameter

a stellar wind pressure three orders of magnitude higher than the solar wind
pressure on Earth. At that time, no Zeeman-Doppler observations of the surface
magnetic field distribution of Proxima Cen were available and a proxy from a
star with similar Rossby number to Proxima was used to drive the MHD model.
Recently, the first ZDI observation of Proxima Cen became available (Klein et
al. 2021). We have modeled Proxima b's space weather using this map and
compared it with the results from the proxy magnetogram. We also computed
models for a high-resolution synthetic magnetogram for Proxima b generated by a
state-of-the-art dynamo model. The resulting space weather conditions for these
three scenarios are similar with only small differences found between the
models based on the ZDI observed magnetogram and the proxy. We conclude that
our proxy magnetogram prescription based on Rossby number is valid, and
provides a simple way to estimate stellar magnetic flux distributions when no
direct observations are available. Comparison with models based on the
synthetic magnetogram show that the exact magnetogram details are not important

main hurdles has been the limited angular resolution of the Spitzer Space

to investigate the matter cycle during the earliest phases of star formation as
a function of the galactic environment. In this Letter, we demonstrate this by
measuring the duration of the embedded phase of star formation and the implied

necessary properties, while the resulting $Z(\tau,\bar \tau)$ is the partition
function of the code CFT -- the Narain theory unambiguously constructed from
the code. Yet there are also ``fake'' polynomials satisfying all necessary
properties, that are not associated with any code. They lead to $Z(\tau,\bar
\tau)$ satisfying all modular bootstrap constraints (modular invariance and
positivity and integrality of character expansion), but whether they are
partition functions of any actual CFT is unclear. We consider the group of the
six simplest fake polynomials and denounce the corresponding $Z$'s as fake: we
show that none of them is the torus partition function of any Narain theory.
Moreover, four of them are not partition functions of any unitary 2d CFT; our
analysis for other two is inconclusive. Our findings point to an obvious
limitation of the modular bootstrap approach: not every solution of the full
set of torus modular bootstrap constraints is due to an actual CFT. In the
paper we consider six simple examples, keeping in mind that thousands more can
be constructed.

that explains this period ratio structure must also explain the strong transit
timing variations (TTVs) observed near resonance. Besides an amplitude and a
period, a sinusoidal TTV has a phase. Often overlooked, TTV phases are
effectively integration constants, encoding information about initial
conditions or the environment. Many TTVs near resonance exhibit non-zero
phases. This observation is surprising because dissipative processes that
capture planets into resonance also damp TTV phases to zero. We show how both
the period ratio structure and the non-zero TTV phases can be reproduced if
pairs of sub-Neptunes capture into resonance in a gas disc while accompanied by
a third eccentric non-resonant body. Convergent migration and eccentricity
damping by the disc drives pairs to orbital period ratios wide of
commensurability; then, after the disc clears, secular forcing by the third
body phase-shifts the TTVs. The scenario predicts that resonant planets are
apsidally aligned and possess eccentricities up to an order of magnitude larger
than previously thought.

three singlet fermions, responsible for seesaw origin of light neutrino masses,
assists in generating correct SIDM relic density via freeze-out. The singlet
fermion, having mass close to but greater than that of SIDM, can lead to
efficient annihilation rate into dark matter, thus compensating for the
latter's depletion due to annihilation into light mediators. In addition to

stellar initial mass function (IMF) down to the hydrogen burning limit of
$0.08$ M$_\odot$. Mass conservation is enforced within a radius of $1$ pc for
the formation of massive stars. We find that massive stars are preferentially
found in star clusters and follow a correlation set at birth between the
highest initial stellar mass and the star cluster mass that differs from pure
stochastic IMF sampling. With a fully sampled IMF, star clusters lose mass in
the galactic tidal field according to mass-loss rates observed in nearby
galaxies. Of the released stellar feedback, $60\%$ of the supernova material
and up to $35\%$ of the wind material reside either in the hot interstellar
medium (ISM) or in gaseous, metal enriched outflows. While stellar winds
(instantaneously) and supernovae (delayed) start enriching the ISM right after
the first massive stars form, the formation of supernova-enriched stars and
star clusters is significantly delayed (by $>50$ Myr) compared to the formation
of stars and star clusters enriched by stellar winds. Overall, supernova ejecta
dominate the enrichment by mass, while the number of enriched stars is
determined by continuous stellar winds. These results present a concept for the
formation of chemically distinct populations of stars in bound star clusters,

3432 first detected in 2000. It is similar and often compared to SN 2009ip, and
it is therefore expected to undergo a core-collapse supernova -- a SN imposter
of similar brightness -- in the near future. We characterize the long-term
variability of AT 2000ch in the radio and optical regimes with archival data
reaching back to the year 1984. We use these newly reduced observations in
addition to observations in the literature to restrict the mass-loss rates of
AT 2000ch at multiple epochs based on different approaches, and to infer the
general properties of its circumstellar nebula with respect to the detected
radio brightness. We extend the known optical light curve of AT 2000ch up to
the beginning of 2022 by performing point spread function photometry on
archival data from the Palomar Transient Factory and the Zwicky Transient
Facility. We reduced archival radio continuum observations obtained with the
Very Large Array using standard calibration and imaging methods and
complemented these with pre-reduced \changes observations as well as
observations obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and LOw
Frequency ARray. For the analysis of AT 2000ch, we consider the optical light
curve and color evolution, its radio continuum brightness at different
frequencies and times, and the corresponding spectral indices. We estimated
mass-loss rates and optical depths based on radio continuum brightnesses and Ha
fluxes. We report two newly detected outbursts of AT 2000ch similar to those
found in the 2000s and 13 re-brightening events, of which at least four are not
conclusively detected because of insufficient sampling of the light curve. The
dates of all outbursts and significant, well-sampled re-brightening events are
consistent with a period of $\sim 201 \pm 12\,$days over a total time-span of
two decades. Such a behavior has never been found for any SN imposter,
especially not for candidate SN~2009ip analogs. During 2010 to 2012 and 2014 to
2018, we only have a few detections, which is insufficient to come to any
conclusion as to a possible less eruptive phase of the transient. We find
steady dimming after the most recent re-brightening events and possible
evidence of porosity in the circumstellar envelope, suggesting AT~2000ch may
currently be in transition to a state of relative calm. We identified a second,
unrelated source at a projected distance of $\sim 23\,$pc
($\sim0.5^{\prime\prime}$) that has contaminated the optical measurements of
AT~2000ch at its minimum luminosity over the last two decades probably on a
$5\%-10\,\%$ level, but this does not affect our overall findings and is
negligible during re-brightening. We are able to restrict the mass-loss rate of
AT~2000ch to range between several $10^{-6}\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}/\textrm{yr}$
and several $10^{-5}\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}/\textrm{yr}$. The fresh ejecta appear
to be optically thick to radio continuum emission at least within the first
$\sim 25\,$days after significant re-brightening.

addition to a loss layer that enables dynamic loss weighting. Results: Guiding
registration using segmentations in the training step proved beneficial for
deep-learning-based image registration. Finetuning the pretrained model from
the brain MRI dataset to the abdominal CT dataset further improved performance

neutrinos generates the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis, much before
the PBHs evaporate. GW interferometers can test this novel spectrum of masses
thanks to the GWs induced by the PBH density fluctuations. In a more refined
version, wherein a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry breaking dynamically generates the
seesaw scale, the PBHs also cause observable spectral distortions on the GWs
from the $U(1)$-breaking cosmic strings. Thence, a low-frequency GW feature
related to DM genesis and detectable with a pulsar-timing array must correspond

platform revenue, and heterogeneous causal learning can help develop more
effective strategies. Most decision-making problems in marketing can be
formulated as resource allocation problems and have been studied for decades.
Existing works usually divide the solution procedure into two fully decoupled
stages, i.e., machine learning (ML) and operation research (OR) -- the first
stage predicts the model parameters and they are fed to the optimization in the
second stage. However, the error of the predicted parameters in ML cannot be
respected and a series of complex mathematical operations in OR lead to the
increased accumulative errors. Essentially, the improved precision on the
prediction parameters may not have a positive correlation on the final solution
due to the side-effect from the decoupled design.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving resource allocation
problems to mitigate the side-effects. Our key intuition is that we introduce
the decision factor to establish a bridge between ML and OR such that the
solution can be directly obtained in OR by only performing the sorting or
comparison operations on the decision factor. Furthermore, we design a
customized loss function that can conduct direct heterogeneous causal learning
on the decision factor, an unbiased estimation of which can be guaranteed when
the loss converges. As a case study, we apply our approach to two crucial
problems in marketing: the binary treatment assignment problem and the budget
allocation problem with multiple treatments. Both large-scale simulations and
online A/B Tests demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvement
compared with state-of-the-art.

significant accomplishments in generating realistic and diverse data. These
approaches define a forward diffusion process for transforming data into noise
and a backward denoising process for sampling data from noise. Unfortunately,
the generation process of current denoising diffusion models is notoriously
slow due to the lengthy iterative noise estimations, which rely on cumbersome
neural networks. It prevents the diffusion models from being widely deployed,
especially on edge devices. Previous works accelerate the generation process of
diffusion model (DM) via finding shorter yet effective sampling trajectories.
However, they overlook the cost of noise estimation with a heavy network in
every iteration. In this work, we accelerate generation from the perspective of
compressing the noise estimation network. Due to the difficulty of retraining
DMs, we exclude mainstream training-aware compression paradigms and introduce
post-training quantization (PTQ) into DM acceleration. However, the output
distributions of noise estimation networks change with time-step, making
previous PTQ methods fail in DMs since they are designed for single-time step
scenarios. To devise a DM-specific PTQ method, we explore PTQ on DM in three
aspects: quantized operations, calibration dataset, and calibration metric. We
summarize and use several observations derived from all-inclusive
investigations to formulate our method, which especially targets the unique
multi-time-step structure of DMs. Experimentally, our method can directly
quantize full-precision DMs into 8-bit models while maintaining or even
improving their performance in a training-free manner. Importantly, our method
can serve as a plug-and-play module on other fast-sampling methods, e.g., DDIM.

front and a diffusion term that prevents collapsing swarms. Altogether the
proposed $K$-swarm CBO algorithm is tailored for a diverse approximation of the
Pareto front and, simultaneously, the efficient set of general non-convex
multi-objective problems. The feasibility of the approach is justified by
analytic results, including convergence proofs, and a performance comparison to
the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA2) and the recently
proposed one-swarm approach for multi-objective problems involving
Consensus-based Optimization.

system evaluation. Existing methods try either mapping the sampling-based
metrics to their global counterparts or more generally, learning the empirical
rank distribution to estimate the top-$K$ metrics. However, despite existing
efforts, there is still a lack of rigorous theoretical understanding of the
proposed metric estimators, and the basic item sampling also suffers from the

with the dynamics of the explosion bubble and the surrounding water. This
multiphase fluid-structure interaction process is investigated using a model
problem that features the yielding and collapse of a thin-walled aluminum
cylinder. A recently developed computational framework that couples a
compressible fluid dynamics solver with a structural dynamics solver is
employed. The fluid-structure and liquid-gas interfaces are tracked using
embedded boundary and level set methods. The conservation law across the
interfaces is enforced by solving one-dimensional bimaterial Riemann problems.
The initial pressure inside the explosion bubble is varied by two orders of
magnitude in different test cases. Three different modes of collapse are
discovered, including an horizontal collapse (i.e. with one lobe extending
towards the explosive charge) that appears counterintuitive, yet has been
observed in previous laboratory experiments. Because of the transition of
modes, the time it takes for the structure to reach self-contact does not
decrease monotonically as the explosion magnitude increases. The flow fields,
the bubble dynamics, and the transient structural deformation are visualized to
elucidate the cause of each collapse mode and the mode transitions. The result
suggests that the pressure pulse resulting from the contraction of the
explosion bubble has significant effect on the structure's collapse. The phase
difference between the structural vibration and bubble oscillation influences
the structure's mode of collapse. Furthermore, the transient structural
deformation has clear effect on the bubble dynamics, leading to a two-way
interaction. A liquid jet that points away from the structure is observed.
Compared to the liquid jets produced by bubbles collapsing near a rigid wall,
this jet is in the opposite direction.

architectures. Features such as long distance interactions and native
multiqubit gates offer reductions in communication costs and operation count.
However, the trapped atoms used as qubits can be lost over the course of
computation and due to adverse environmental factors. The value of a lost
computation qubit cannot be recovered and requires the reloading of the array
and rerunning of the computation, greatly increasing the number of runs of a
circuit. Software mitigation strategies exist but exhaust the original mapped
locations of the circuit slowly and create more spread out clusters of qubits
across the architecture decreasing the probability of success. We increase
flexibility by developing strategies that find all reachable qubits, rather
only adjacent hardware qubits. Second, we divide the architecture into separate
sections, and run the circuit in each section, free of lost atoms. Provided the
architecture is large enough, this resets the circuit without having to reload
the entire architecture. This increases the number of effective shots before
reloading by a factor of two for a circuit that utilizes 30% of the
architecture. We also explore using these sections to parallelize execution of
circuits, reducing the overall runtime by a total 50% for 30 qubit circuit.
These techniques contribute to a dynamic new set of strategies to combat the
detrimental effects of lost computational space.

distributed in different locations in space, and assuming that each spy
possesses a small, but incomplete by itself part of a big secret, is it
possible to securely transmit all these partial secrets to the spymaster, so
that they can be combined together in order to reveal the big secret? We refer
to it as the Quantum Secret Aggregation problem, and we propose a protocol, in
the form of a quantum game, with Alice taking over the role of the spymaster,
that addresses this problem in complete generality. Our protocol relies on the
use of maximally entangled GHZ tuples, which are symmetrically distributed
among Alice and all her spies. It is the power of entanglement that makes
possible the secure transmission of the small partial secrets from the agents

of the protocol, by making it statistically improbable for the notorious
eavesdropper Eve to steal the big secret.

be at odds with standard accuracy and may have further disparate impacts on
different classes, it remains an open question to what extent such observations
hold and how the class imbalance plays a role within. In this paper, we attempt
to understand this question of accuracy disparity by taking a closer look at
linear classifiers under a Gaussian mixture model. We decompose the impact of
adversarial robustness into two parts: an inherent effect that will degrade the
standard accuracy on all classes due to the robustness constraint, and the
other caused by the class imbalance ratio, which will increase the accuracy
disparity compared to standard training. Furthermore, we also show that such
effects extend beyond the Gaussian mixture model, by generalizing our data
model to the general family of stable distributions. More specifically, we
demonstrate that while the constraint of adversarial robustness consistently
degrades the standard accuracy in the balanced class setting, the class
imbalance ratio plays a fundamentally different role in accuracy disparity
compared to the Gaussian case, due to the heavy tail of the stable
distribution. We additionally perform experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets to corroborate our theoretical findings. Our empirical
results also suggest that the implications may extend to nonlinear models over
real-world datasets. Our code is publicly available on GitHub at

data: from the pre-dementia state of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to the
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is collected and analyzed by explicitly
unraveling prognostic heterogeneity among 346 uncensored and 557 right censored
subjects under structural dependency among covariate features. The
non-informative censoring mechanism is tested and confirmed based on
conditional-vs-marginal entropies evaluated upon contingency tables built by
the Redistribute-to-the-right algorithm. The Categorical Exploratory Data
Analysis (CEDA) paradigm is applied to evaluate conditional entropy-based
associative patterns between the categorized response variable against 16
categorized covariable variables all having 4 categories. Two order-1 global
major factors: V9 (MEM-mean) and V8 (ADAS13.bl) are selected sharing the
highest amounts of mutual information with the response variable. This heavily
censored data set is analyzed by Cox's proportional hazard (PH) modeling.
Comparisons of PH and CEDA results on a global scale are complicated under the
structural dependency of covariate features. To alleviate such complications,
V9 and V8 are taken as two potential perspectives of heterogeneity and the
entire collections of subjects are divided into two sets of four
sub-collections. CEDA major factor selection protocol is applied to all
sub-collections to figure out which features provide extra information. Graphic
displays are developed to explicitly unravel conditional entropy expansions
upon perspectives of heterogeneity in ADNI data. On the local scale, PH
analysis is carried out and results are compared with CEDA's. We conclude that,
when facing structural dependency among covariates and heterogeneity in data,

non-straightforward methods suffer from two drawbacks: 1) Imprecise bounding
boxes or unsatisfactory semantic predictions limit the performance of the
overall 3D instance segmentation framework. 2) Existing method requires a
time-consuming intermediate step of aggregation. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a novel end-to-end 3D instance segmentation method based on
Superpoint Transformer, named as SPFormer. It groups potential features from
point clouds into superpoints, and directly predicts instances through query
vectors without relying on the results of object detection or semantic
segmentation. The key step in this framework is a novel query decoder with
transformers that can capture the instance information through the superpoint
cross-attention mechanism and generate the superpoint masks of the instances.
Through bipartite matching based on superpoint masks, SPFormer can implement
the network training without the intermediate aggregation step, which
accelerates the network. Extensive experiments on ScanNetv2 and S3DIS
benchmarks verify that our method is concise yet efficient. Notably, SPFormer
exceeds compared state-of-the-art methods by 4.3% on ScanNetv2 hidden test set

loss of derivatives at the level of \textsl{a priori} estimates: while the odd

grouping (SEG), and random element grouping (REG) strategies. The channel gains
for users are derived within both the pure near-field regime and the hybrid
near-field and far-field regime. Finally, numerical results confirm that: 1)
for metasurface-based RISs, the field boundary depends on the sizes of both the

their effectiveness in taking into account distant information. Our study
reveals the key connection between the local graph geometry and the occurrence

demonstrate that over-smoothing is linked to positive graph curvature while
over-squashing is linked to negative graph curvature. Based on our theory, we

slightly warm Earth's surface because of increases in radiative forcing.
Radiative forcing is the difference in the net upward thermal radiation flux
from the Earth through a transparent atmosphere and radiation through an
otherwise identical atmosphere with greenhouse gases. Radiative forcing,
normally measured in W/m^2, depends on latitude, longitude and altitude, but it
is often quoted for the tropopause, about 11 km of altitude for temperate
latitudes, or for the top of the atmosphere at around 90 km. For current
concentrations of greenhouse gases, the radiative forcing per added N2O
molecule is about 230 times larger than the forcing per added carbon dioxide
(CO2) molecule. This is due to the heavy saturation of the absorption band of
the relatively abundant greenhouse gas, CO2, compared to the much smaller
saturation of the absorption bands of the trace greenhouse gas N2O. But the
rate of increase of CO2 molecules, about 2.5 ppm/year (ppm = part per million
by mole), is about 3000 times larger than the rate of increase of N2O
molecules, which has held steady at around 0.00085 ppm/year since 1985. So, the
contribution of nitrous oxide to the annual increase in forcing is 230/3000 or
about 1/13 that of CO2. If the main greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O have
contributed about 0.1 C/decade of the warming observed over the past few
decades, this would correspond to about 0.00064 K per year or 0.064 K per
century of warming from N2O. Proposals to place harsh restrictions on nitrous
oxide emissions because of warming fears are not justified by these facts.
Restrictions would cause serious harm; for example, by jeopardizing world food
supplies.

modifications in the quark-gluon plasma differs between theoretical models.
Therefore a fully data-driven technique is crucial for an unbiased extraction
of the quark and gluon jet spectra and substructure. Corroborating past
results, I demonstrate the capability of a fully data-driven technique called
topic modeling in separating quark and gluon contributions to jet observables.
The data-driven topic separation results can further be used to extract jet

about the spatial distribution of target objects beyond what is captured
visually (for example, due to spatial correlation). We propose a reinforcement
learning approach for VAS that leverages a collection of fully annotated search
tasks as training data to learn a search policy, and combines features of the

we propose domain adaptation techniques to improve the policy at decision time

action at each step of the episode followed by another agent (follower). The
state evolution and rewards depend on the joint action pair of the leader and
the follower. Such type of interactions can find applications in many domains
such as smart grids, mechanism design, security, and policymaking. We are
interested in how to learn policies for both the players with provable
performance guarantee under a bandit feedback setting. We focus on a setup
where both the leader and followers are {\em non-myopic}, i.e., they both seek
to maximize their rewards over the entire episode and consider a linear MDP
which can model continuous state-space which is very common in many RL
applications. We propose a {\em model-free} RL algorithm and show that
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret bounds can be achieved for both

$H$ is the length of the episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps under
the bandit feedback information setup. Thus, our result holds even when the
number of states becomes infinite. The algorithm relies on {\em novel}
adaptation of the LSVI-UCB algorithm. Specifically, we replace the standard
greedy policy (as the best response) with the soft-max policy for both the

meteors and the Planck continuum can prevail in slow meteors. It is possible to
estimate the meteor brightness in the visible spectral range from this
narrowband radiation, but it is vital to first study the dependence of this
radiation on the meteor velocity. Methods. We used observations from the
well-established European Fireball Network with newly developed digital
spectral cameras that allowed us to study the oxygen triplet in meteor spectra
and its relation to the meteor velocity and altitude. In addition, we studied
strong magnesium and sodium lines. Results. We developed a method for
calibration of fireball observation reported by Geostationary Lightning Mapper
(GLM) sensors on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
(GOES) weather satellites. We confirm that in slow meteors, the radiation of
the Planck continuum dominates, but for faster meteors, a correction on
velocity is needed. We observe that the altitude where the oxygen line was
recorded can also affect the radiation at 777 nm. In addition, determining
whether or not the meteor showed a bright flare could also lead to a similar
effect. Thus, the meteor brightness estimate may be impacted by these
characteristics. We derived simple corrections on the altitude and on the
meteor brightness that helped to improve the overall precision of the magnitude
estimate of our sample. This allowed us to estimate the magnitude of meteors
observed by GLM with an accuracy of ~ 1 in magnitude. The Na/Mg line intensity
ratio was found to be constant for velocities above 25 km/s and increasing

evidence for a dichotomous distribution of stellar rotational velocities, with
10-30% of stars rotating slowly and the remaining 70-90% rotating fairly
rapidly. At the same time, high-precision multiband photometry of young star
clusters shows a split main sequence band, which is again interpreted as due to
a spin dichotomy. Recent papers suggest that extreme rotation is required to
retrieve the photometric split. Our new grids of MESA models and the prevalent
SYCLIST models show, however, that initial slow (0-35% of the linear Keplerian
rotation velocities) and intermediate (50-65% of the Keplerian rotation
velocities) rotation are adequate to explain the photometric split. These
values are consistent with the recent spectroscopic measurements of cluster and
field stars, and are likely to reflect the birth spin distributions of upper
main-sequence stars. A fraction of the initially faster-rotating stars may be
able to reach near-critical rotation at the end of their main-sequence
evolution and produce Be stars in the turn-off region of young star clusters.
However, we find that the presence of Be stars up to two magnitudes below the
cluster turnoff advocates for a crucial role of binary interaction in creating
Be stars. We argue that surface chemical composition measurements may help
distinguish these two Be star formation channels. While only the most rapidly
rotating, and therefore nitrogen-enriched, single stars can evolve into Be
stars, slow pre-mass-transfer rotation and inefficient accretion allows for
mild or no enrichment even in critically rotating accretion-induced Be stars.
Our results shed new light on the origin of the spin distribution of young and
evolved B-type main sequence stars.

Johnson","A ductility-strength metric for chemically complex alloys","15 pages, 8 figures, 1 Table",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Local lattice distortions (LLD) $-$ relative to average (x-ray) lattice
positions $-$ are expected in multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) due to the
varying complex chemical environments. We suggest a dimensionless metric to
characterize ductility in MPEAs using LLD. With its innate quantum-mechanical
origins, ductility is clearly affected by LLD arising from increased atomic
charge transfer due to electronegativity differences in each local environment
(often designated by valence electron count (VEC)). To test this metric, we
chose body-centered cubic (bcc) refractory alloys that exhibit a range of
ductility$-$brittleness. The metric was established by combining the
weighted$-$average VEC ($\Delta{w}_{VEC}$) and intrinsic parameters
($\Delta{u}$,$\sqrt{(\Delta{u})^2}$) related to distortion from the average
lattice. The electronic-structure results were calculated using
density-functional theory (DFT) methods. The quantitative rank ordering of
ductile$-$to$-$brittle MPEAs shows good agreement with recent mean-field
estimates and experiments. Our results permit a quick ductility assessment to
guide the design of more ductile high-temperature MPEAs, and potentially
accelerated further if combined with machine-learning.

configurational entropy, site selectivity, and magnetism in high entropy
oxides. In this work we characterize the magnetic properties of the spinel
(Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni)$_3$O$_4$ and study the evolution of its magnetism as a
function of non-magnetic gallium substitution. Across the range of compositions
studied here, from 0% to 40% Ga, magnetic susceptibility and powder neutron
diffraction measurements show that ferrimagnetic order is robust in the spinel
HEO. However, we also find that the ferrimagnetic order is highly tunable, with
the ordering temperature, saturated and sublattice moments, and magnetic
hardness all varying significantly as a function of Ga concentration. Through
x-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, we are able to correlate this
magnetic tunability with strong site selectivity between the various cations
and the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the spinel structure. In
particular, we find that while Ni and Cr are largely unaffected by the
substitution with Ga, the occupancies of Mn, Co, and Fe are each significantly
redistributed. Ga substitution also requires an overall reduction in the
transition metal valence, and this is entirely accommodated by Mn. Finally, we
show that while site selectivity has an overall suppressing effect on the
configurational entropy, over a certain range of compositions, Ga substitution
yields a striking increase in the configurational entropy and may confer
additional stabilization. Spinel oxides can be tuned seamlessly from the
low-entropy to the high-entropy regime, making this an ideal platform for
entropy engineering.

  sources","Minor changes for submission to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Massive stars are the progenitors of black holes and neutron stars, the
mergers of which can be detected with gravitational waves (GW). The expansion
of massive stars is one of the key factors affecting their evolution in close
binary systems, but it remains subject to large uncertainties in stellar
astrophysics. For population studies and predictions of GW sources, the stellar
expansion is often simulated with the analytic formulae from Hurley et al.
(2000). These formulae need to be extrapolated for stars beyond 50 solar masses
and are often considered outdated. In this work we present five different
prescriptions developed from 1D stellar models to constrain the maximum
expansion of massive stars. We adopt these prescriptions to investigate how
stellar expansion affects mass transfer interactions and in turn the formation
of GW sources. We show that limiting radial expansion with updated 1D stellar
models, when compared to the use of Hurley et al. (2000) radial expansion
formulae, does not significantly affect GW source properties (rates and
masses). This is because most mass transfer events leading to GW sources are
initialised before the donor star reaches its maximum expansion. The only
significant difference was found for the mass distribution of massive binary
black hole mergers (total mass > 50 solar masses) formed from stars that may
evolve beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, whose radial expansion is the most
uncertain. We conclude that understanding the expansion of massive stars and
the origin of the Humphrey-Davidson limit is a key factor for the study of GW
sources.

frequencies of the two waves (medium dependent) must lie within a definite and

We compare angular distributions for the in-cone radiation for different medium

energy loss proceeds via the radiative break-up of hard fragments, followed by
an angular broadening of soft fragments. While the dilution of the medium due
to expansion significantly affects the broadening of the leading fragments, we
provide evidence that in the low-$x$ regime, which is responsible for most of
the gluon multiplicity in the cascade, the angular distributions are very
similar when comparing different medium profiles at an equivalent, effective
in-medium path length. This is mainly due to the fact that in this regime, the
broadening is dominated by multiple splittings. Finally, we discuss the impact

  Systems, and Applications, 2022, 11 pages",,,,"cs.CR cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hashed Timelock (HTLC)-based atomic swap protocols enable the exchange of
coins between two or more parties without relying on a trusted entity. This
protocol is like the American call option without premium. It allows the
finalization of a deal within a certain period. This puts the swap initiator at
liberty to delay before deciding to proceed with the deal. If she finds the
deal unprofitable, she just waits for the time-period of the contract to
elapse. However, the counterparty is at a loss since his assets remain locked
in the contract. The best he can do is to predict the initiator's behavior
based on the asset's price fluctuation in the future. But it is difficult to
predict as cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, and their price fluctuates
abruptly. We perform a game theoretic analysis of HTLC-based atomic cross-chain
swap to predict whether a swap will succeed or not. From the strategic behavior
of the players, we infer that this model lacks fairness. We propose Quick Swap,
a two-party protocol based on hashlock and timelock that fosters faster
settlement of the swap. The parties are required to lock griefing-premium along
with the principal amount. If the party griefs, he ends up paying the
griefing-premium. If a party finds a deal unfavorable, he has the provision to
cancel the swap. We prove that Quick Swap is more participant-friendly than
HTLC-based atomic swap. Our work is the first to propose a protocol to ensure
fairness of atomic-swap in a cyclic multi-party setting.

topology in biaxially strained GdSb (001) epitaxial films using angle-resolved

that biaxial strain continuously tunes the electronic structure from
topologically trivial to nontrivial, reducing the gap between the hole and the
electron bands dispersing along the [001] direction. The conduction and valence
band shifts seen in DFT and ARPES measurements are explained by a tight-binding
model that accounts for the orbital symmetry of each band. Finally, we discuss
the effect of biaxial strain on carrier compensation and magnetic ordering

Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), an important property is the
total brightness of all image pixels (image size), which is in direct
correlation with the energy of primary particles. We used a cGAN technique to
generate images similar to whose obtained in the TAIGA-IACT experiment. As a
training set, we used a set of two-dimensional images generated using the TAIGA
Monte Carlo simulation software. We artificiallly divided the training set into
10 classes, sorting images by size and defining the boundaries of the classes
so that the same number of images fall into each class. These classes were used
while training our network. The paper shows that for each class, the size
distribution of the generated images is close to normal with the mean value
located approximately in the middle of the corresponding class. We also show
that for the generated images, the total image size distribution obtained by
summing the distributions over all classes is close to the original
distribution of the training set. The results obtained will be useful for more
accurate generation of realistic synthetic images similar to the ones taken by
IACTs.

fundamental probes of the ionization state and chemical composition of
circumgalactic and intergalactic gas near the end of the reionization epoch.
Large absorber samples are required to robustly measure typical absorber
properties and to refine models of the synthesis, transport, and ionization of
metals in the early Universe. The ""Ultimate XSHOOTER legacy survey of quasars
at z~5.8-6.6"" (XQR-30) has obtained high signal-to-noise spectra of 30 luminous
quasars, nearly quadrupling the existing sample of 12 high quality z~6 quasar
spectra. We use this unprecedented sample to construct a catalog of 778 systems
showing absorption in one or more of MgII (360 systems), FeII (184), CII (46),
CIV (479), SiIV (127), and NV (13) which span 2 < z < 6.5. This catalog
significantly expands on existing samples of z > 5 absorbers, especially for
CIV and SiIV which are important probes of the ionizing photon background at
high redshift. The sample is 50% (90%) complete for rest-frame equivalent
widths W > 0.03AA (0.09AA). We publicly release the absorber catalog along with
completeness statistics and a Python script to compute the absorption search
path for different ions and redshift ranges. This dataset is a key legacy
resource for studies of enriched gas from the era of galaxy assembly to cosmic
noon, and paves the way for even higher redshift studies with the James Webb
Space Telescope and 30m-class telescopes.

growing interest for their adapatbility to living systems. To describe their
elastic properties, the classical Oseen-Frank theory requires anomalously small
twist constants and (comparatively) large saddle-splay constants, so large as
to violate one of Ericksen's inequalities, which guarantee that the Oseen-Frank
stored-energy density is bounded below. While such a violation does not prevent
the existence and stability of equilibrium distortions in problems with fixed
geometric confinement, the study of free-boundary problems for droplets has
revealed a number of paradoxical consequences. Minimizing sequences driving the
total energy to negative infinity have been constructed by employing ever
growing needle-shaped tactoids incorporating a diverging twist [Phy. Rev. E

elastic theory that extends for chromonics the classical Oseen-Frank stored
energy by adding a quartic twist term. We show that the total energy of
droplets is bounded below in the quartic twist theory, so that the known
paradoxes are ruled out. The quartic term introduces a phenomenological length
$a$ in the theory; this affects the equilibrium of chromonics confined within
capillary tubes. Use of published experimental data allows us to estimate $a$.

theory framework for studying magnetic field generation as a result of
stochastic fluid motions. By constructing a stochastic kinematic dynamo model,
we derive statistical properties of the magnetic field that may be compared to
observations from the paleomagnetic record. The fluid velocity is taken to act
as a random forcing obeying Gaussian statistics. Using the
Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) formalism, we compute the
average magnetic field response function. From this we obtain an estimate for
the turbulent contribution to the magnetic diffusivity, and find that it is

we study the contributions of Population III (Pop III) and Population II (Pop
II) stars to the production of $\mathrm{Fe,~Si,~Zn, ~Ni,~P, ~Mg, ~Al, ~S, ~C,
~N}$, and $\mathrm{~O}$. We aim to quantify the roles of two different models
in the chemical enrichment of the Universe. The first model (A) considers both
stars with Pop III and Pop II yields. For the second model (B), the yields
involved are only for Pop II stars. We start by describing the cosmic star
formation rate (CSFR) through an adaptation of a scenario developed within the
hierarchical scenario of structure formation with a Press-Schechter-like
formalism. We adapt the formalism to implement the CSFR to the standard
chemical evolution scenario to investigate the course of chemical evolution on
a cosmological basis. Calculations start at redshift $z\sim 20$, and we compare
the results of our two models with data from damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems
(DLAs), and globular clusters (GCs). Our main results find that metal
production in the Universe occurred very early, quickly increasing with the
formation of the first stars. When comparing results for [Fe/H] with
observations from GCs, yields of Pop II stars are not enough to explain the
observed chemical abundances, requiring stars with physical properties similar
those expected from Pop III stars. Our semi-analytic model can deliver
consistent results for the evolution of cosmic metallicities. Our results show
that the chemical enrichment in the early Universe is rapid, and at redshift
$\sim 12.5$, the metallicity reaches $10^{-4}\, Z_{\odot}$ for the model that
includes Pop III stars. In addition, we explore values for the initial mass
function (IMF) within the range $[0.85, 1.85]$.

been studied. Much of the progress over the last two decades on this problem
has been on the algorithmic side. For instance, an algorithm of Behnezhad
[FOCS'21] obtains a 1/2-approximation in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time for $n$-vertex
graphs. A more recent algorithm by Behnezhad, Roghani, Rubinstein, and Saberi
[SODA'23] obtains a slightly-better-than-1/2 approximation in
$O(n^{1+\epsilon})$ time. On the lower bound side, Parnas and Ron [TCS'07]
showed 15 years ago that obtaining any constant approximation of maximum
matching size requires $\Omega(n)$ time. Proving any super-linear in $n$ lower
bound, even for $(1-\epsilon)$-approximations, has remained elusive since then.
  In this paper, we prove the first super-linear in $n$ lower bound for this
problem. We show that at least $n^{1.2 - o(1)}$ queries in the adjacency list
model are needed for obtaining a $(\frac{2}{3} + \Omega(1))$-approximation of
maximum matching size. This holds even if the graph is bipartite and is
promised to have a matching of size $\Theta(n)$. Our lower bound argument
builds on techniques such as correlation decay that to our knowledge have not
been used before in proving sublinear time lower bounds.
  We complement our lower bound by presenting two algorithms that run in
strongly sublinear time of $n^{2-\Omega(1)}$. The first algorithm achieves a
$(\frac{2}{3}-\epsilon)$-approximation; this significantly improves prior
close-to-1/2 approximations. Our second algorithm obtains an even better
approximation factor of $(\frac{2}{3}+\Omega(1))$ for bipartite graphs. This
breaks the prevalent $2/3$-approximation barrier and importantly shows that our
$n^{1.2-o(1)}$ time lower bound for $(\frac{2}{3}+\Omega(1))$-approximations
cannot be improved all the way to $n^{2-o(1)}$.

code generation which can generate executable code from functional descriptions
in natural languages, possibly together with signatures. Despite substantial
performance improvement of PCGMs, the role of method names in neural code
generation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we study and
demonstrate the potential of benefiting from method names to enhance the
performance of PCGMs, from a model robustness perspective. Specifically, we
propose a novel approach, named RADAR (neuRAl coDe generAtor Robustifier).
RADAR consists of two components: RADAR-Attack and RADAR-Defense. The former
attacks a PCGM by generating adversarial method names as part of the input,
which are semantic and visual similar to the original input, but may trick the
PCGM to generate completely unrelated code snippets. As a countermeasure to
such attacks, RADAR-Defense synthesizes a new method name from the functional
description and supplies it to the PCGM. Evaluation results show that
RADAR-Attack can, e.g., reduce the CodeBLEU of generated code by 19.72% to
38.74% in three state-of-the-art PCGMs (i.e., CodeGPT, PLBART, and CodeT5).
Moreover, RADAR-Defense is able to reinstate the performance of PCGMs with
synthesized method names. These results highlight the importance of good method
names in neural code generation and implicate the benefits of studying model

novel method for massive MIMO CSI feedback via a one-sided deep learning
framework. The CSI is compressed via linear projections at the UE, and is
recovered at the BS using deep plug-and-play priors (PPP). Instead of using
handcrafted regularizers for the wireless channel responses, the proposed
approach, namely CSI-PPPNet, exploits a deep learning (DL) based denoisor in
place of the proximal operator of the prior in an alternating optimization
scheme. In this way, a DL model trained once for denoising can be repurposed
for CSI recovery tasks with arbitrary linear projections. In addition to the
one-for-all property, the one-sided framework relieves the burden of joint
model training and model delivery and could be applied at UEs with limited
device memories and computation power, in comparison to the two-sided
autoencoder-based CSI feedback architecture. This opens new perspectives for
DL-based CSI feedback. Extensive experiments over the open indoor and urban

size. In a gravitationally collapsing cloud, a circumstellar disk forms around
a protostar and drives a protostellar outflow. Almost all the small dust grains
($a_{\rm d} \lesssim 10$--$100\,\mu$m) initially distributed in the region

inner disk region from the upper envelope preferentially fall onto the

  Optimization in Machine Learning",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A number of competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain why
small-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)leads to improved generalization
over the full-batch regime, with recent work crediting the implicit
regularization of various quantities throughout training. However, to date,
empirical evidence assessing the explanatory power of these hypotheses is
lacking. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, focusing
on the ability of various theorized mechanisms to close the small-to-large
batch generalization gap. Additionally, we characterize how the quantities that
SGD has been claimed to (implicitly) regularize change over the course of
training. By using micro-batches, i.e. disjoint smaller subsets of each
mini-batch, we empirically show that explicitly penalizing the gradient norm or
the Fisher Information Matrix trace, averaged over micro-batches, in the
large-batch regime recovers small-batch SGD generalization, whereas
Jacobian-based regularizations fail to do so. This generalization performance
is shown to often be correlated with how well the regularized model's gradient
norms resemble those of small-batch SGD. We additionally show that this
behavior breaks down as the micro-batch size approaches the batch size.
Finally, we note that in this line of inquiry, positive experimental findings
on CIFAR10 are often reversed on other datasets like CIFAR100, highlighting the
need to test hypotheses on a wider collection of datasets.

to the SMP in the sample. In addition, it is noticed that the appearance of
Josephson vortices below 16 K renders easy magnetic flux penetration. A
detailed vortex dynamics study suggests that the SMP can be explained in terms
of elastic pinning to plastic pinning crossover. Furthermore, contrary to the
common understanding, the temperature variation of the first peak field, $H_1$,
below and above 16 K, behaves non-monotonically. A highly disordered vortex
phase, governed by plastic pinning, has been observed between 17 K and 23 K,
within a field region around an extremely large first peak field. Pinning force
scaling suggests that the point defects are the dominant source of pinning for
$H$ $\parallel$$ab$-planes, whereas, for H $\parallel$$c$-axis, point defects
in addition to surface defects are at play. Such disorder contributes to the
pinning due to the variation in charge carrier mean free path,
$\delta$$l$-pinning. Moreover, the large $J_c$ observed in our study is
consistent with the literature, which advocates this material for high magnetic
field applications.

  Subseasonal Forecasting","Journal of Climate",,,,"cs.LG physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Producing high-quality forecasts of key climate variables such as temperature
and precipitation on subseasonal time scales has long been a gap in operational
forecasting. Recent studies have shown promising results using machine learning
(ML) models to advance subseasonal forecasting (SSF), but several open
questions remain. First, several past approaches use the average of an ensemble
of physics-based forecasts as an input feature of these models. However,
ensemble forecasts contain information that can aid prediction beyond only the
ensemble mean. Second, past methods have focused on average performance,
whereas forecasts of extreme events are far more important for planning and
mitigation purposes. Third, climate forecasts correspond to a spatially-varying
collection of forecasts, and different methods account for spatial variability
in the response differently. Trade-offs between different approaches may be
mitigated with model stacking. This paper describes the application of a
variety of ML methods used to predict monthly average precipitation and two
meter temperature using physics-based predictions (ensemble forecasts) and
observational data such as relative humidity, pressure at sea level, or
geopotential height, two weeks in advance for the whole continental United
States. Regression, quantile regression, and tercile classification tasks using
linear models, random forests, convolutional neural networks, and stacked
models are considered. The proposed models outperform common baselines such as
historical averages (or quantiles) and ensemble averages (or quantiles). This
paper further includes an investigation of feature importance, trade-offs
between using the full ensemble or only the ensemble average, and different
modes of accounting for spatial variability.

bills. However, the conventional DR techniques come with several shortcomings,
such as the inability to handle operational uncertainties while incurring
end-user disutility, which prevents widespread adoption in real-world
applications. The proposed framework addresses these shortcomings by
implementing DR and DEM based on real-time pricing strategy that is achieved
using deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, this framework enables the
power grid service provider to leverage distributed energy resources (i.e., PV
rooftop panels and battery storage) as dispatchable assets to support the smart

resources. Simulation results based on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) demonstrate
significant improvements of the 24-hour accumulative profit for both prosumers

we introduce a physics-based forward model to accurately account for the

introduce Peano, a theorem-proving environment where the set of valid actions

reinforcement learning methods for symbolic reasoning to be insufficient to
solve harder problems. Adding the ability to induce reusable abstractions

solving all problems. Furthermore, these abstractions induce an order to the

second-generation agents trained on the recovered curriculum learn
significantly faster. These results illustrate the synergistic role of

(ImageNav) where an agent is initialized in an unfamiliar environment and
tasked with navigating to a location 'described' by an image. Unlike related
navigation tasks, ImageNav does not have a standardized task definition which
makes comparison across methods difficult. Further, existing formulations have
two problematic properties; (1) image-goals are sampled from random locations
which can lead to ambiguity (e.g., looking at walls), and (2) image-goals match
the camera specification and embodiment of the agent; this rigidity is limiting
when considering user-driven downstream applications. We present the
Instance-specific ImageNav task (InstanceImageNav) to address these
limitations. Specifically, the goal image is 'focused' on some particular
object instance in the scene and is taken with camera parameters independent of
the agent. We instantiate InstanceImageNav in the Habitat Simulator using
scenes from the Habitat-Matterport3D dataset (HM3D) and release a standardized
benchmark to measure community progress.

differentiate which points belong to classes such as ground, buildings, or
vegetation. Point clouds generated from aerial sensors mounted to drones or
planes can utilise LIDAR sensors or cameras along with photogrammetry. Each
method of data collection contains unique characteristics which can be learnt
independently with state-of-the-art point cloud segmentation models. Utilising
a single point cloud segmentation model can be desirable in situations where
point cloud sensors, quality, and structures can change. In these situations it
is desirable that the segmentation model can handle these variations with
predictable and consistent results. Although deep learning can segment point
clouds accurately it often suffers in generalisation, adapting poorly to data
which is different than the training data. To address this issue, we propose to
utilise multiple available open source fully annotated datasets to train and
test models that are better able to generalise.
  In this paper we discuss the combination of these datasets into a simple
training set and challenging test set. Combining datasets allows us to evaluate
generalisation performance on known variations in the point cloud data. We show
that a naive combination of datasets produces a model with improved
generalisation performance as expected. We go on to show that an improved
sampling strategy which decreases sampling variations increases the
generalisation performance substantially on top of this. Experiments to find
which sample variations give this performance boost found that consistent
densities are the most important.

Chawla","FakeEdge: Alleviate Dataset Shift in Link Prediction","Accepted to Learning on Graph",,,,"cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Link prediction is a crucial problem in graph-structured data. Due to the
recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs), a variety of GNN-based models
were proposed to tackle the link prediction task. Specifically, GNNs leverage
the message passing paradigm to obtain node representation, which relies on
link connectivity. However, in a link prediction task, links in the training
set are always present while ones in the testing set are not yet formed,
resulting in a discrepancy of the connectivity pattern and bias of the learned
representation. It leads to a problem of dataset shift which degrades the model
performance. In this paper, we first identify the dataset shift problem in the
link prediction task and provide theoretical analyses on how existing link
prediction methods are vulnerable to it. We then propose FakeEdge, a
model-agnostic technique, to address the problem by mitigating the graph
topological gap between training and testing sets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the applicability and superiority of FakeEdge on multiple datasets
across various domains.

  Intelligence)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Neural network interpretation methods, particularly feature attribution
methods, are known to be fragile with respect to adversarial input
perturbations. To address this, several methods for enhancing the local
smoothness of the gradient while training have been proposed for attaining
\textit{robust} feature attributions. However, the lack of considering the
normalization of the attributions, which is essential in their visualizations,
has been an obstacle to understanding and improving the robustness of feature
attribution methods. In this paper, we provide new insights by taking such
normalization into account. First, we show that for every non-negative
homogeneous neural network, a naive $\ell_2$-robust criterion for gradients is
\textit{not} normalization invariant, which means that two functions with the
same normalized gradient can have different values. Second, we formulate a
normalization invariant cosine distance-based criterion and derive its upper
bound, which gives insight for why simply minimizing the Hessian norm at the
input, as has been done in previous work, is not sufficient for attaining
robust feature attribution. Finally, we propose to combine both $\ell_2$ and
cosine distance-based criteria as regularization terms to leverage the
advantages of both in aligning the local gradient. As a result, we
experimentally show that models trained with our method produce much more
robust interpretations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 without significantly
hurting the accuracy, compared to the recent baselines. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to verify the robustness of interpretation on
a larger-scale dataset beyond CIFAR-10, thanks to the computational efficiency
of our method.

updates the time allocation using analytical gradients. The lower-level problem
incorporates the safety-set constraints (in the form of inequality constraints)

lower-level QP by excluding the inequality constraints for the safety sets,
which significantly reduces the computation time. The safety-set constraints
are moved to the upper-level problem, where the feasible waypoints are updated
together with the time allocation using analytical gradients enabled by the
OptNet. We validate our approach in simulations, where our method's computation
time scales linearly with respect to the number of safety sets, in contrast to
the state-of-the-art that scales exponentially.

neural networks for 3D data that are equivariant under rotation and translation
of the input. Most approaches for equivariance under the Euclidean group
$\mathrm{SE}(3)$ of rotations and translations fall within one of the two major
categories. The first category consists of methods that use
$\mathrm{SE}(3)$-convolution which generalizes classical
$\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution on signals over $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. Alternatively, it
is possible to use \textit{steerable convolution} which achieves
$\mathrm{SE}(3)$-equivariance by imposing constraints on
$\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution of tensor fields. It is known by specialists in the
field that the two approaches are equivalent, with steerable convolution being
the Fourier transform of $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ convolution. Unfortunately, these
results are not widely known and moreover the exact relations between deep
learning architectures built upon these two approaches have not been precisely
described in the literature on equivariant deep learning. In this work we
provide an in-depth analysis of both methods and their equivalence and relate
the two constructions to multiview convolutional networks. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical justifications of separability of $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ group
convolution, which explain the applicability and success of some recent
approaches. Finally, we express different methods using a single coherent
formalism and provide explicit formulas that relate the kernels learned by
different methods. In this way, our work helps to unify different
previously-proposed techniques for achieving roto-translational equivariance,
and helps to shed light on both the utility and precise differences between
various alternatives. We also derive new TFN non-linearities from our
equivalence principle and test them on practical benchmark datasets.

a magnetized accretion disk around a BH accreting at $\sim 12-25$ times the

analysis, we demonstrate that TDE jets may provide compelling targets, within
the context of the models explored in this work. In particular, we find that
jets launched by a SANE super-Eddington disk around a spin $a_*=0.9$ reach the
ngEHT detection threshold at large distances (up to 100 Mpc in this work). A
two-temperature plasma in the jet or weaker jets, such as a spin $a_*=0$ model,
requires a much closer distance as we demonstrate detection at 10 Mpc for
limiting cases of $a_*=0,\,\mathcal{R}=1$ or $a_*=0.9,\, \mathcal{R}=20$. We
also demonstrate that TDE jets may appear as superluminal sources if the BH is
rapidly rotating and the jet is viewed nearly face on.

avoid them, and assess how the overall survey is affected. Given a reasonably
accurate satellite orbit forecast, we find it is possible to adjust the
scheduler algorithm to effectively avoid some satellites. Overall, sacrificing
10% of LSST observing time to avoid satellites reduces the fraction of LSST
visits with streaks by a factor of two. Whether such a mitigation will be
required depends on the overall impact of streaks on science, which is not yet
well quantified. This is due to a lack of adequate information about satellite
brightness distributions as well as the impact of glints and low surface
brightness residuals on alert purity and systematic errors in cosmological
parameter estimation. A significant increase in the number of satellites or
their brightness during Rubin Operations may make implementing this satellite

whether MFRs are present well before the eruption. Our aim is to identify
progenitors of MFRs, and investigate pre-eruptive magnetic properties
associated with these progenitors. Here we analyze 28 MFRs erupting within 45
deg from the disk center from 2010 to 2015. All MFRs'feet are well identified
by conjugate coronal dimmings. We then calculate magnetic properties at the
feet of the MFRs, prior to their eruptions, using Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) vector magnetograms. Our results show that only 8 erupting MFRs
are associated with significant non-neutralized electric currents, 4 of which
also exhibit pre-eruptive dimmings at the foot-prints. Twist and current
distributions are asymmetric at the two feet of these MFRs. The presence of
pre-eruption dimmings associated with non-neutralized currents suggests the
pre-existing MFRs. Furthermore, evolution of conjugate dimmings and electric
currents within the foot-prints can provide clues about the internal structure
of MFRs and their formation mechanism.

two deep learning-based near-field beam training schemes in XL-RIS-assisted

the optimal near-field RIS codeword. Specifically, we first propose a far-field
beam-based beam training (FBT) scheme in which the received signals of all
far-field RIS codewords are fed into the neural network to estimate the optimal
near-field RIS codeword. In order to further reduce the pilot overhead, a
partial near-field beam-based beam training (PNBT) scheme is proposed, where
only the received signals corresponding to the partial near-field XL-RIS
codewords are served as input to the neural network. Moreover, we further
propose an improved PNBT scheme to enhance the performance of beam training by
fully exploring the neural network's output. Finally, simulation results show

different training and inference paradigm. Re-ID is a fine-grained recognition
task with complex feature embedding, and model outputs commonly used by
existing MI like logits and losses are not accessible during inference. Since
Re-ID focuses on modelling the relative relationship between image pairs
instead of individual semantics, we conduct a formal and empirical analysis
which validates that the distribution shift of the inter-sample similarity
between training and test set is a critical criterion for Re-ID membership
inference. As a result, we propose a novel membership inference attack method
based on the inter-sample similarity distribution. Specifically, a set of
anchor images are sampled to represent the similarity distribution conditioned
on a target image, and a neural network with a novel anchor selection module is
proposed to predict the membership of the target image. Our experiments
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both the Re-ID task and
conventional classification task.

Markov Decision Process (MDP). We propose variations of existing Reinforcement

discrete control in real-world environments. Experiments show that the
multi-agent setting outperforms the single-agent setting in all the scenarios.
We also propose reliable initialization, data augmentation, and training
techniques that enable the agents to learn and generalize to navigate in a
real-world environment with minimal input video data, and with minimal
training. Additionally, to show the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, we
deploy our method in the virtual driving environment TORCS.

(DL) models, require large amounts of labeled data. For classification
problems, the most common learning paradigm consists of presenting labeled
examples during training, thus providing strong supervision on what constitutes
positive and negative samples. This constitutes a major obstacle for the
development of DL models in radiology--in particular for cross-sectional
imaging (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scans)--where labels must come from
manual annotations by expert radiologists at the image or slice-level. These
differ from examination-level annotations, which are coarser but cheaper, and
could be extracted from radiology reports using natural language processing
techniques. This work studies the question of what kind of labels should be
collected for the problem of intracranial hemorrhage detection in brain CT. We
investigate whether image-level annotations should be preferred to
examination-level ones. By framing this task as a multiple instance learning
problem, and employing modern attention-based DL architectures, we analyze the
degree to which different levels of supervision improve detection performance.
We find that strong supervision (i.e., learning with local image-level
annotations) and weak supervision (i.e., learning with only global
examination-level labels) achieve comparable performance in examination-level
hemorrhage detection (the task of selecting the images in an examination that
show signs of hemorrhage) as well as in image-level hemorrhage detection
(highlighting those signs within the selected images). Furthermore, we study
this behavior as a function of the number of labels available during training.
Our results suggest that local labels may not be necessary at all for these
tasks, drastically reducing the time and cost involved in collecting and
curating datasets.

enablers of 6G wireless networks, for which channel estimation is highly
challenging. Traditional analytical estimation methods are no longer effective,
as the enlarged array aperture and the small wavelength result in a mixture of
far-field and near-field paths, constituting a hybrid-field channel. Deep
learning (DL)-based methods, despite the competitive performance, generally
lack theoretical guarantees and scale poorly with the size of the array. In
this paper, we propose a general DL framework for THz UM-MIMO channel
estimation, which leverages existing iterative channel estimators and is with
provable guarantees. Each iteration is implemented by a fixed point network
(FPN), consisting of a closed-form linear estimator and a DL-based non-linear
estimator. The proposed method perfectly matches the THz UM-MIMO channel
estimation due to several unique advantages. First, the complexity is low and
adaptive. It enjoys provable linear convergence with a low per-iteration cost
and monotonically increasing accuracy, which enables an adaptive
accuracy-complexity tradeoff. Second, it is robust to practical distribution
shifts and can directly generalize to a variety of heavily out-of-distribution
scenarios with almost no performance loss, which is suitable for the
complicated THz channel conditions. For practical usage, the proposed framework
is further extended to wideband THz UM-MIMO systems with beam squint effect.
Theoretical analysis and extensive simulation results are provided to
illustrate the advantages over the state-of-the-art methods in estimation
accuracy, convergence rate, complexity, and robustness.

stochastic setting, where in each iteration a single sample is generated to
estimate the objective gradient. The algorithm adaptively selects the
trust-region radius and, compared to the existing line-search StoSQP schemes,
allows us to employ indefinite Hessian matrices (i.e., Hessians without
modification) in SQP subproblems. As a trust-region method for constrained
optimization, our algorithm needs to address an infeasibility issue -- the
linearized equality constraints and trust-region constraints might lead to
infeasible SQP subproblems. In this regard, we propose an \textit{adaptive
relaxation technique} to compute the trial step that consists of a normal step
and a tangential step. To control the lengths of the two steps, we adaptively
decompose the trust-region radius into two segments based on the proportions of
the feasibility and optimality residuals to the full KKT residual. The normal
step has a closed form, while the tangential step is solved from a trust-region
subproblem, to which a solution ensuring the Cauchy reduction is sufficient for
our study. We establish the global almost sure convergence guarantee for
TR-StoSQP, and illustrate its empirical performance on both a subset of

reinforcement learning, an agent is required to solve one task and then another
sequentially while retaining performance and preventing forgetting on past
tasks. World models offer a task-agnostic solution: they do not require
knowledge of task changes. World models are a straight-forward baseline for
continual reinforcement learning for three main reasons. Firstly, forgetting in
the world model is prevented by persisting existing experience replay buffers
across tasks, experience from previous tasks is replayed for learning the world
model. Secondly, they are sample efficient. Thirdly and finally, they offer a
task-agnostic exploration strategy through the uncertainty in the trajectories
generated by the world model. We show that world models are a simple and

effectiveness on Minigrid and Minihack continual reinforcement learning

has recently been investigated in the quantum query model. The decisional
version of this problem, LCS with threshold $d$, asks whether two length-$n$
input strings have a common substring of length $d$. The two extreme cases,
$d=1$ and $d=n$, correspond respectively to Element Distinctness and
Unstructured Search, two fundamental problems in quantum query complexity.
However, the intermediate case $1\ll d\ll n$ was not fully understood. We show
that the complexity of LCS with threshold $d$ smoothly interpolates between the
two extreme cases up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors: LCS with threshold $d$ has a
quantum algorithm in $n^{2/3+o(1)}/d^{1/6}$ query complexity and time
complexity, and requires at least $\Omega(n^{2/3}/d^{1/6})$ quantum query
complexity. Our result improves upon previous upper bounds $\tilde O(\min
\{n/d^{1/2}, n^{2/3}\})$ (Le Gall and Seddighin ITCS 2022, Akmal and Jin SODA
2022), and answers an open question of Akmal and Jin.
  Our main technical contribution is a quantum speed-up of the powerful String
Synchronizing Set technique introduced by Kempa and Kociumaka (STOC 2019). It
consistently samples $n/\tau^{1-o(1)}$ synchronizing positions in the string
depending on their length-$\Theta(\tau)$ contexts, and each synchronizing
position can be reported by a quantum algorithm in $\tilde O(\tau^{1/2+o(1)})$
time.
  As another application of our quantum string synchronizing set, we study the
$k$-mismatch Matching problem, which asks if the pattern has an occurrence in
the text with at most $k$ Hamming mismatches. Using a structural result of
Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz (FOCS 2020), we obtain a quantum
algorithm for $k$-mismatch matching with $k^{3/4} n^{1/2+o(1)}$ query
complexity and $\tilde O(kn^{1/2})$ time complexity.

predicting binary masks in the mel-spectrogram domain and the other is directly

identify the singing voice segments over time more explicitly. We measured the

prevents the aforementioned unphysical energy transfer, but is also shown to

target with low radiation dose and cost compared with conventional computed
tomography, and it is widely used in the detection of paranasal sinus disease.
However, it lacks the sensitivity to detect soft tissue lesions owing to
reconstruction constraints. Consequently, only physicians with expertise in
CBCT reading can distinguish between inherent artifacts or noise and diseases,
restricting the use of this imaging modality. The development of artificial
intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided diagnosis methods for CBCT to overcome
the shortage of experienced physicians has attracted substantial attention.
However, advanced AI-based diagnosis addressing intrinsic noise in CBCT has not
been devised, discouraging the practical use of AI solutions for CBCT. To
address this issue, we propose an AI-based computer-aided diagnosis method
using CBCT with a denoising module. This module is implemented before diagnosis
to reconstruct the internal ground-truth full-dose scan corresponding to an
input CBCT image and thereby improve the diagnostic performance. The external
validation results for the unified diagnosis of sinus fungal ball, chronic

improve diagnostic performance and reader interpretability in images from the

bandwidth that is not easy to scale. To provide higher quality of experience
(QoE) under limited bandwidth, a recent trend is to leverage the heterogeneity
of quality preferences across individual users. Although these efforts have
suggested the great potential benefits, service providers still have not
deployed them to realize the promised QoE improvement. The missing piece is an
automation of online per-user QoE modeling and optimization scheme for new
users. Previous efforts either optimize QoE by known per-user QoE models or
learn a user's QoE model by offline approaches, such as analysis of video
viewing history and in-lab user study. Relying on such offline modeling is
problematic, because QoE optimization will start late for collecting enough
data to train an unbiased QoE model. In this paper, we propose VidHoc, the
first automatic system that jointly personalizes QoE model and optimizes QoE in
an online manner for each new user. VidHoc can build per-user QoE models within
a small number of video sessions as well as maintain good QoE. We evaluate
VidHoc in a pilot deployment to fifteen users for four months with the care of
statistical validity. Compared with other baselines, the results show that
VidHoc can save 17.3% bandwidth while maintaining the same QoE or improve QoE
by 13.9% with the same bandwidth.

architecture to overcome the optimization challenges often faced by
physics-informed neural networks. Since the convolution operator in PINO uses
the Fourier series representation, its gradient can be computed exactly on the
Fourier space. While Fourier series cannot represent nonperiodic functions,
PINO and FNO still have the expressivity to learn nonperiodic problems with
Fourier extension via padding. However, computing the Fourier extension in the
physics-informed optimization requires solving an ill-conditioned system,
resulting in inaccurate derivatives which prevent effective optimization. In
this work, we present an architecture that leverages Fourier continuation (FC)
to apply the exact gradient method to PINO for nonperiodic problems. This paper
investigates three different ways that FC can be incorporated into PINO by
testing their performance on a 1D blowup problem. Experiments show that FC-PINO

which may be modeled by the run-and-tumble particle (RTP), a representative
model in the study of active matters. Here we resolve this problem for an
asymmetric RTP in one-dimension, firstly constructing a finite time
thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for a RTP, which works well in the
short observation time regime for entropy production estimation. Nevertheless,
when the activity dominates,i.e., the RTP is far from equilibrium, the lower
bound for entropy production from TUR turns to be trivial. We address this
issue by introducing a recently proposed high-order thermodynamic uncertainty
relation (HTUR), in which the cumulant generating function of current serve as
a key ingredient. To exploit the HTUR, we adopt a novel method to analytically
obtain the cumulant generating function of the current we study, with no need
to explicitly know the time-dependent probability distribution. The HTUR is
demonstrated to be able to estimate the steady state energy dissipation rate
accurately because the cumulant generating function covers higher-order
statistics of the current, including rare and large fluctuations besides its
variance. Compared to the conventional TUR, the HTUR could give significantly
improved estimation of energy dissipation, which can work well even in the

of whether the winding number is topological, can be explained by the fact that
they both arise when the Loschmidt amplitude vanishes.

  Architectures with Progressive Volume Distillation","Accepted by AAAI2023. Project Page: https://sk-fun.fun/PVD",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods have proved effective as compact,
high-quality and versatile representations for 3D scenes, and enable downstream
tasks such as editing, retrieval, navigation, etc. Various neural architectures
are vying for the core structure of NeRF, including the plain Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), sparse tensors, low-rank tensors, hashtables and their
compositions. Each of these representations has its particular set of
trade-offs. For example, the hashtable-based representations admit faster
training and rendering but their lack of clear geometric meaning hampers
downstream tasks like spatial-relation-aware editing. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Volume Distillation (PVD), a systematic distillation method that
allows any-to-any conversions between different architectures, including MLP,
sparse or low-rank tensors, hashtables and their compositions. PVD consequently
empowers downstream applications to optimally adapt the neural representations
for the task at hand in a post hoc fashion. The conversions are fast, as
distillation is progressively performed on different levels of volume
representations, from shallower to deeper. We also employ special treatment of
density to deal with its specific numerical instability problem. Empirical
evidence is presented to validate our method on the NeRF-Synthetic, LLFF and
TanksAndTemples datasets. For example, with PVD, an MLP-based NeRF model can be
distilled from a hashtable-based Instant-NGP model at a 10X~20X faster speed
than being trained the original NeRF from scratch, while achieving a superior
level of synthesis quality. Code is available at

pairwise mutual information estimates from the target dataset to ensure that
strongly correlated bits are placed closer to each other relative to the

a saw-tooth ratchet potential. Using the Langevin simulation and matrix
continued fraction method, the particle transport, steady state diffusion, and
coherence in transport are investigated throughout the ratchet. Spatial
asymmetry is found to be the key criterion for the possibility of directed
transport in the ratchet. Interestingly, the simulated particle trajectories
and the corresponding position and velocity distribution functions reveal that
the system passes through an activity-induced transition in the transport from
the running phase to the locked phase with the self-propulsion/activity time of
the dynamics. This is further corroborated by the mean square displacement
(MSD) calculation. The MSD gets suppressed with increase in the persistence of
activity in the medium and finally approaches zero for very large value of self
propulsion time, reflecting a kind of trapping of the particle by the ratchet
for longer persistent of activity in the medium. The non-monotonic behaviour of
the particle current and Peclet number with self propulsion time confirms that
the particle transport and it's coherence can be enhanced or reduced by fine
tuning the persistent duration of activity. Moreover, for an intermediate range
of self-propulsion time in the dynamics as well as for an intermediate range of
mass of the particle, even though the particle current shows a pronounced
unusual maximum with mass, there is no enhancement in the Peclet number,
instead the Peclet number decreases with mass, confirming the degradation of
coherence in transport. Finally, from the analytical calculations, it is
observed that for a highly viscous medium, where the inertial influence is
negligibly small, the particle current approaches the current in the over
damped regime.

Specifically, we refer to tracking based on targets' shadows. Current methods

solve these, we propose a shadow-oriented multi-target tracking method
(SOTrack). To avoid false tracking, a pre-processing module is proposed to
enhance shadows from surroundings, thus reducing their interferences. To avoid
missed tracking, a detection method based on deep learning is designed to
thoroughly learn shadows' features, thus increasing the accurate estimation.
And further, a recall module is designed to recall missed shadows. We conduct
experiments on measured data. Results demonstrate that, compared with other
methods, SOTrack achieves much higher performance in tracking accuracy-18.4%.
And ablation study confirms the effectiveness of the proposed modules.

any additional dependence on galaxy surface brightness, a proxy for stellar
mass surface density. We use a large sample of low redshift ($z \leq 0.08$)
galaxies from the GAMA survey which have both SED derived star formation rates
and photometric bulge-disc decompositions, the latter providing measures of
disc surface brightness and disc masses. Using two samples, one of galaxies
fitted by a single component with S\'{e}rsic index below 2 and one of the discs

subject in computer vision and document analysis because of its wide range of

One of the algorithms which has good text detection performance in the said
competition is the Character Region Awareness for Text Detection (CRAFT).
Employing the ICDAR 2013 dataset, this study investigates the impact of
automatic image classification and blind deconvolution as image pre-processing
steps to further enhance the text detection performance of CRAFT. The proposed
technique automatically classifies the scene images into two categories, blurry
and non-blurry, by utilizing of a Laplacian operator with 100 as threshold.
Prior to applying the CRAFT algorithm, images that are categorized as blurry
are further pre-processed using blind deconvolution to reduce the blur. The
results revealed that the proposed method significantly enhanced the detection
performance of CRAFT, as demonstrated by its IoU h-mean of 94.47% compared to
the original 91.42% h-mean of CRAFT and this even outperformed the top-ranked
SenseTime, whose h-mean is 93.62%.

WSINDy estimator is unconditionally asymptotically consistent for a wide class
of models which includes the Navier-Stokes equations and the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We thus provide a mathematically rigorous
explanation for the observed robustness to noise of weak-form equation
learning. Conversely, we also show that in general the WSINDy estimator is only
conditionally asymptotically consistent, yielding discovery of spurious terms
with probability one if the noise level is above some critical threshold and
the nonlinearities exhibit sufficiently fast growth. We derive explicit bounds
on the critical noise threshold in the case of Gaussian white noise and provide
an explicit characterization of these spurious terms in the case of
trigonometric and/or polynomial model nonlinearities. However, a silver lining
to this negative result is that if the data is suitably denoised (a simple
moving average filter is sufficient), then we recover unconditional asymptotic
consistency on the class of models with locally-Lipschitz nonlinearities.
Altogether, our results reveal several important aspects of weak-form equation
learning which may be used to improve future algorithms. We demonstrate our
results numerically using the Lorenz system, the cubic oscillator, a viscous

clusters might reach several per cent, significantly higher than that of the
field ($\sim$ a per cent). In a stellar cluster, when a planetary system
scatters with a stellar binary, it may acquire a companion star which may
excite large amplitude von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations in the planet's
orbital eccentricity, triggering high-eccentricity migration and the formation
of an HJ. We quantify the efficiency of this mechanism by modelling the
evolution of a gas giant around a solar mass star under the influence of
successive scatterings with binary and single stars. We show that the chance
that a planet $\in(1,10)$ au becomes an HJ in a Gyr in a cluster of stellar
density $n_*=50$ pc$^{-3}$ and binary fraction $f_\mathrm{bin}=0.5$ is about
2\% and an additional 4\% are forced by the companion star into collision with
or tidal disruption by the central host. An empirical fit shows that the total
percentage of those outcomes asymptotically reaches an upper limit determined
solely by $f_\mathrm{bin}$ (e.g., $10\%$ at $f_\mathrm{bin}=0.3$ and 18\% at
$f_\mathrm{bin}=1$) on a timescale inversely proportional to $n_*$ ($\sim$ Gyr
for $n_*\sim100$ pc$^{-3}$). The ratio of collisions to tidal disruptions is
roughly a few, and depends on the tidal model. Therefore, if the giant planet
occurrence rate is 10~\%, our mechanism implies an HJ occurrence rate of a few
times 0.1~\% in a Gyr and can thus explain a substantial fraction of the
observed rate.

can even change their topologically protected properties. An example of this
phenomenon is the gap opening in the topologically protected gapless surface
state in finite-thickness topological-insulator films. However, much is not
known about the quantum size effect in topological heterojunctions. In this
study, by calculating the single-particle spectrum of Bi/Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$
based on the well-known Liu-Allen model, we found that the strong quantum size
effect in topological heterojunctions yields an unexpected band alignment. The
wave functions permeate each other through the attached materials, and this
occurs even in 80-nm-thick heterojunctions. Furthermore, we theoretically found
that one of the two major spectra obtained from the Bi surface does not
represent the true surface state of Bi. This finding may overturn the previous
understanding of the topological surface state of Bi.

from base categories with sufficient labelled data to novel categories with
scarce known information. It is currently an important research question and
has great practical values in the real-world applications. Despite extensive
previous efforts are made on few-shot learning tasks, we emphasize that most
existing methods did not take into account the distributional shift caused by
sample selection bias in the FSL scenario. Such a selection bias can induce
spurious correlation between the semantic causal features, that are causally
and semantically related to the class label, and the other non-causal features.
Critically, the former ones should be invariant across changes in
distributions, highly related to the classes of interest, and thus well
generalizable to novel classes, while the latter ones are not stable to changes
in the distribution. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel data
augmentation strategy dubbed as PatchMix that can break this spurious
dependency by replacing the patch-level information and supervision of the
query images with random gallery images from different classes from the query
ones. We theoretically show that such an augmentation mechanism, different from
existing ones, is able to identify the causal features. To further make these
features to be discriminative enough for classification, we propose
Correlation-guided Reconstruction (CGR) and Hardness-Aware module for instance
discrimination and easier discrimination between similar classes. Moreover,
such a framework can be adapted to the unsupervised FSL scenario.

compositional nature of human language. In this work, we further explore the
hypothesis that syntactic dependencies can be represented in the attention
distributions of language models trained on text and propose a new method to
induce these structures theory-agnostically. Instead of modeling syntactic
relations as defined by annotation schemata, we model a more general property
implicit in the definition of dependency relations, syntactic substitutability.
This property captures the fact that the words at either end of a syntactic
dependency can be substituted with words from the same syntactic category,
defining a set of syntactically-invariant sentences whose representations are
then used as the basis for parsing. We demonstrate that our method results in
both qualitative and quantitative gains, for example achieving 78.3% recall on

generate new data, typically require the signal at each step to have the same
dimension. We argue that, considering the spatial redundancy in image signals,
there is no need to maintain a high dimensionality in the evolution process,
especially in the early generation phase. To this end, we make a theoretical
generalization of the forward diffusion process via signal decomposition.
Concretely, we manage to decompose an image into multiple orthogonal components
and control the attenuation of each component when perturbing the image. That
way, along with the noise strength increasing, we are able to diminish those
inconsequential components and thus use a lower-dimensional signal to represent
the source, barely losing information. Such a reformulation allows to vary
dimensions in both training and inference of diffusion models. Extensive
experiments on a range of datasets suggest that our approach substantially
reduces the computational cost and achieves on-par or even better synthesis
performance compared to baseline methods. We also show that our strategy
facilitates high-resolution image synthesis and improves FID of diffusion model
trained on FFHQ at $1024\times1024$ resolution from 52.40 to 10.46. Code and

central to the study of fast moving phenomena. The difficulty of imaging fast
moving scenes lies in a trade-off between motion blur and underexposure noise:
On the one hand, recordings with long exposure times suffer from motion blur
effects caused by movements in the recorded scene. On the other hand, the
amount of light reaching camera photosensors decreases with exposure times so
that short-exposure recordings suffer from underexposure noise. In this paper,
we propose to address this trade-off by treating the problem of high-speed
imaging as an underexposed image denoising problem. We combine recent advances
on underexposed image denoising using deep learning and adapt these methods to
the specificity of the high-speed imaging problem. Leveraging large external

ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks.
Occlusion is a critical factor that affects on the generalization ability of
image classification models. In order to generate new samples, existing data
augmentation methods based on information deletion simulate occluded samples by
randomly removing some areas in the images. However, those methods cannot
delete areas of the images according to their structural features of the
images. To solve those problems, we propose a novel data augmentation method,
AdvMask, for image classification tasks. Instead of randomly removing areas in
the images, AdvMask obtains the key points that have the greatest influence on
the classification results via an end-to-end sparse adversarial attack module.
Therefore, we can find the most sensitive points of the classification results
without considering the diversity of various image appearance and shapes of the
object of interest. In addition, a data augmentation module is employed to
generate structured masks based on the key points, thus forcing the CNN
classification models to seek other relevant content when the most
discriminative content is hidden. AdvMask can effectively improve the
performance of classification models in the testing process. The experimental
results on various datasets and CNN models verify that the proposed method
outperforms other previous data augmentation methods in image classification
tasks.

The main application is to model and represent curved geometry without gaps and

sharp-to-smooth modeling capability handles unstructured configurations of the
simulation points, curves, and surfaces. The surfaces correspond to initial
linear triangulations that determine the sharp point and curve features. The
method automatically suggests a subset of sharp features to smooth which the
user modifies to obtain a limit model preserving the initial points. This model
reconstructs the curvature by subdivision of the initial mesh, with no need of
an underlying curved geometry model. Finally, given a polynomial degree and a
nodal distribution, the method generates a piece-wise polynomial representation
interpolating the limit model. We show numerical evidence that this
approximation, naturally aligned to the subdivision features, converges to the
model geometrically with the polynomial degree for nodal distributions with
sub-optimal Lebesgue constant. We also apply the method to prescribe the curved
boundary of a high-order volume mesh. We conclude that our sharp-to-smooth

symbolic layer for explainable prediction in terms of human-intelligible
concepts; and a low-level neural layer for extracting symbols required to
generate the symbolic explanation. Real data is often imperfect meaning that
even if the symbolic theory remains unchanged, we may still need to address the
problem of mapping raw data to high-level symbols, each time there is a change
in the data acquisition environment or equipment. Manual (re-)annotation of the
raw data each time this happens is laborious and expensive; and automated
labelling methods are often imperfect, especially for complex problems.
NEUROLOG proposed the use of a semantic loss function that allows an existing
feature-based symbolic model to guide the extraction of feature-values from raw
data, using `abduction'. However, the experiments demonstrating the use of
semantic loss through abduction appear to rely heavily on a domain-specific
pre-processing step that enables a prior delineation of feature locations in
the raw data. We examine the use of semantic loss in domains where such
pre-processing is not possible, or is not obvious. We show that without any
prior information about the features, the NEUROLOG approach can continue to
predict accurately even with substantially incorrect feature predictions. We
show also that prior information about the features in the form of even
imperfect pre-training can help correct this situation. These findings are
replicated on the original problem considered by NEUROLOG, without the use of
feature-delineation. This suggests that symbolic explanations constructed for
data in a domain could be re-used in a related domain, by `feature-adaptation'
of pre-trained neural extractors using the semantic loss function constrained
by abductive feedback.

that is order-optimal with respect to time for both adversarial and stochastic
arrivals and has a significantly better performance compared to FTPL with
respect to the switching cost for stochastic arrivals. We also show that these
results can be generalized to the setting where there are constraints on the
frequency with which cache contents can be changed. Finally, we validate the
results obtained on various synthetic as well as real-world traces.

meet-semilattices where not all subsets need have joins. A selection function,
S, specifies, for all meet-semilattices, certain subsets under consideration,
which we call the ``designated'' ones; an S-frame then must have joins of (at
least) all such subsets and binary meet must distribute over these. A small
collection of axioms suffices to specify our selection functions; these axioms
are sufficiently general to include as examples of partial frames, bounded
distributive lattices, sigma-frames, kappa-frames and frames. We consider right
and left adjoints of S-frame maps, as a prelude to the introduction of closed
and open maps.
  Then we look at what might be an appropriate notion of Booleanness for
partial frames. The obvious candidate is the condition that every element be
complemented; this concept is indeed of interest, but we pose three further
conditions which, in the frame setting, are all equivalent to it. However, in
the context of partial frames, the four conditions are distinct. In
investigating these, we make essential use of the free frame over a partial
frame and the congruence frame of a partial frame.
  We compare congruences of a partial frame, technically called S-congruences,
with the frame congruences of its free frame. We provide a natural
transformation for the situation and also consider right adjoints of the frame
maps in question. We characterize the case where the two congruence frames are
isomorphic and provide examples which illuminate the possible different
behaviour of the two. We conclude with a characterization of closedness and
openness for the embedding of a partial frame into its free fame, and into its
congruence frame.

urge the exploration of post-training quantization. However, the heavy-tailed

enhancement for the post-training activation quantization performance of vision

quantizer, adding a fixed Uniform noisy bias to the values being quantized can
significantly reduce the quantization error under provable conditions. Building
on the theoretical insight, NoisyQuant achieves the first success on actively
altering the heavy-tailed activation distribution with additive noisy bias to
fit a given quantizer. Extensive experiments show NoisyQuant largely improves
the post-training quantization performance of vision transformer with minimal
computation overhead. For instance, on linear uniform 6-bit activation
quantization, NoisyQuant improves SOTA top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by up to
1.7%, 1.1% and 0.5% for ViT, DeiT, and Swin Transformer respectively, achieving
on-par or even higher performance than previous nonlinear, mixed-precision

perturbations during standard operations, some of them can excite normal modes
of the system and cause significant energy transfers across the system,
creating large oscillations thousands of miles away from the source.
Localization of the source of such disturbances remains an outstanding
challenge due to a limited knowledge of the system parameters outside of the
zone of responsibility of system operators. Here, we propose a new method for
locating the source of forced oscillations which addresses this challenge by
performing a simultaneous dynamic model identification using a principled
maximum likelihood approach. We illustrate the validity of the algorithm on a
variety of examples where forcing leads to resonance conditions in the system
dynamics. Our results establish that an accurate knowledge of system parameters
is not required for a successful inference of the source and frequency of a
forced oscillation. We anticipate that our method will find a broader
application in general dynamical systems that can be well-described by their
linearized dynamics over short periods of time.

to train the models. We do so by devising a number of experiments, training
models on the Dataset of Industrial Metal Objects (DIMO). This dataset contains
both real and synthetic images. The synthetic part has different subsets that
are either exact synthetic copies of the real data or are copies with certain
aspects randomised. This allows us to analyse what types of variation are good
for synthetic training data and which aspects should be modelled to closely
match the target data. Furthermore, we investigate what types of training
techniques are beneficial towards generalisation to real data, and how to use
them. Additionally, we analyse how real images can be leveraged when training
on synthetic images. All these experiments are validated on real data and
benchmarked to models trained on real data. The results offer a number of

problem, which is the ever-changing targets at every iteration when multiple
agents update their policies at the same time. Starting from first principle,
in this paper, we manage to solve the non-stationarity problem by proposing
bidirectional action-dependent Q-learning (ACE). Central to the development of
ACE is the sequential decision-making process wherein only one agent is allowed
to take action at one time. Within this process, each agent maximizes its value
function given the actions taken by the preceding agents at the inference
stage. In the learning phase, each agent minimizes the TD error that is
dependent on how the subsequent agents have reacted to their chosen action.
Given the design of bidirectional dependency, ACE effectively turns a
multiagent MDP into a single-agent MDP. We implement the ACE framework by
identifying the proper network representation to formulate the action
dependency, so that the sequential decision process is computed implicitly in
one forward pass. To validate ACE, we compare it with strong baselines on two
MARL benchmarks. Empirical experiments demonstrate that ACE outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms on Google Research Football and StarCraft
Multi-Agent Challenge by a large margin. In particular, on SMAC tasks, ACE
achieves 100% success rate on almost all the hard and super-hard maps. We

In this paper, we study the structural effects of this penalty term on the MARL
problem. First, we show that the standard practice of using the constraint
function as the penalty leads to a weak notion of safety. However, by making
simple modifications to the penalty term, we can enforce meaningful
probabilistic (chance and conditional value at risk) constraints. Second, we
quantify the effect of the penalty term on the value function, uncovering an
improved value estimation procedure. We use these insights to propose a
constrained multiagent advantage actor critic (C-MAA2C) algorithm. Simulations
in a simple constrained multiagent environment affirm that our reinterpretation
of the primal-dual method in terms of probabilistic constraints is effective,
and that our proposed value estimate accelerates convergence to a safe joint

when information from outside the training dataset is used to create a model.
This phenomenon renders a model excessively optimistic or even useless in the
real world since the model tends to leverage greatly on the unfairly acquired
information. To date, detection of data leakages occurs post-mortem using
run-time methods. However, due to the insidious nature of data leakage, it may
not be apparent to a data scientist that a data leakage has occurred in the
first place. For this reason, it is advantageous to detect data leakages as
early as possible in the development life cycle. In this paper, we propose a
novel static analysis to detect several instances of data leakages during
development time. We define our analysis using the framework of abstract
interpretation: we define a concrete semantics that is sound and complete, from
which we derive a sound and computable abstract semantics. We implement our
static analysis inside the open-source NBLyzer static analysis framework and
demonstrate its utility by evaluating its performance and precision on over
2000 Kaggle competition notebooks.

Despite recent improvements in the scalability of learning algorithms, their
practical applicability is still an open issue. Little work exists that
actually learns models of physical black-box systems. To fill this gap in the
literature, we present a case study on applying automata learning on the
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. It shows that not only the size of the
system limits the applicability of automata learning.
  Also, the interaction with the system under learning creates a major
bottleneck that is rarely discussed. In this article, we propose a general
automata learning architecture for learning a behavioral model of the BLE
protocol implemented by a physical device. With this framework, we can
successfully learn the behavior of six investigated BLE devices. Furthermore,
we extended the learning technique to learn security critical behavior, e.g.,
key-exchange procedures for encrypted communication. The learned models depict
several behavioral differences and inconsistencies to the BLE specification.
This shows that automata learning can be used for fingerprinting black-box
devices, i.e., characterizing systems via their specific learned models.
Moreover, learning revealed a crashing scenario for one device.

an alternative to traditional aural point count surveys, with the possibility
to deploy long-term acoustic surveys in large and complex natural environments.
However, there is still a clear need to evaluate how the frequency-and
distancedependent attenuation of sound as well as the ambient sound level
impact the acoustic detection distance of the soniferous species in natural
environments over the diel cycles and across seasons. This is of great
importance to avoid pseudoreplication and to provide relevant biodiversity
indicators, including species richness, species abundance and species density.
2. To address the issue of detection distance, we tested a field-based protocol
in a Neotropical rainforest (French Guiana, France) and in an Alpine coniferous
forest (Jura, France). This standardized and repeatable method consists in a
recording session of the ambient sound directly followed by an experiment using
a calibrated white noise sound broadcast at different positions along a 100 m
linear transect. We then used acoustic laws to reveal the basic physics behind
sound propagation attenuation. 3. We demonstrate that habitat attenuation in
two different kinds of forests can be modelled by an exponential decay law with
a linear dependence on frequency and distance. We also report that habitat
attenuation, as first approximation, can be summarized by a single value, the
coefficient of attenuation of the habitat. 4. Finally, we show that the
detection distance can be predicted knowing the contribution of each
attenuation factor, the coefficient of attenuation of the habitat, the ambient
sound pressure level and the amplitude and frequency bandwidth characteristics
of the transmitted sound. We show that the detection 1 distance mostly depends
on the ambient sound and may vary by a factor of up to 5 over the diel cycle
and across seasons. These results reinforce the need to take into account the
variation of the detection distance when performing passive acoustic surveys
and producing reliable biodiversity indicators.

understandable by humans for better trust and confidence. To this effect,
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and
Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENN) have been proposed which constrain the
latent space of a model to represent high level concepts easily understood by
domain experts in the field. Although concept-based models promise a good
approach to both increasing explainability and reliability, it is yet to be
shown if they demonstrate robustness and output consistent concepts under
systematic perturbations to their inputs. To better understand performance of
concept-based models on curated malicious samples, in this paper, we aim to
study their robustness to adversarial perturbations, which are also known as
the imperceptible changes to the input data that are crafted by an attacker to

For the gamma-Al2O3 crystal, a bulk transformation to alpha-Al2O3 by an
FCC-to-HCP transition of the O sublattice is still kinetically hindered at 900
K. However, local distortions of the FCC O-sublattice by the formation of
quasi-octahedral Al local coordination spheres become thermally activated, as
driven by the partial covalency of the Al-O bond. On the contrary, spherical
gamma-Al2O3 NPs (with sizes of 6 and 10 nm) undergo a crystalline-to-amorphous
transformation at 900 K, which starts at the reconstructed surface and
propagates into the core through collective displacements of anions and
cations, resulting in the formation of 7- and 8-fold local coordination spheres
of Al. In parallel, the reconstructed Al-enriched surface is separated from the
stoichiometric core by a diffuse Al-depleted transition region. This
compositional heterogeneity creates a disbalance of charges inside the NP,
which induces a net attractive Coulombic force that is strong enough to reverse
the initial stress state in the NP core from compressive to tensile. These
findings disclose the delicate interplay between lattice distortions, stresses,
and space-charge regions in oxide nanosystems. A fundamental explanation for
the reported expansion of metal-oxide NPs with decreasing size is provided,

very large mass ratios $M_1/M_2$ to mass ratios very close to unity. A
well-known example of a binary is the Pluto-Charon system. With Charon only
eight times less massive than Pluto the question arises as for many other
systems, why the mass-ratio is still close to unity. There is much evidence
that (binary) planet(esimal) formation happened early, when the protoplanetary
gas disk was still around. It is likely that (some of) these binaries grew up
together subject to pebble accretion. Here we focus on the question of how the
mass arriving in the gravitational influence zone of the binary during pebble
accretion, is distributed over the binary components. Does the accretion
through time lead to a converging mass ratio, or to a diverging mass ratio? We
numerically integrate pebble paths in the same well-known fashion as for a
single mass subject to pebble accretion and track what the efficiency of
accretion is for the two separate binary components, compared to a single body
with the same mass. These numerical simulations are done for a range of binary
mass-ratios, mutual separations, Stokes numbers and two orbital distances, 2.5
and 39 au. We find that in the limit where pebbles start to spiral around the
primary (this holds for relatively large pebbles), the pebble preferentially
collides with the secondary, causing the mass ratio to converge towards unity
on Myr timescales. In this regime the total sweep-up efficiency can lower to
half that of a pebble-accreting single body because pebbles that are thrown out
of the system, after close encounters with the system. The results show that
systems such as Pluto-Charon and other larger equal mass binaries could well
have co-accreted by means of pebble accretion in the disk phase without
producing binaries with highly diverging mass-ratios.

nonequilibrium properties are manifested by identifying the visible probability
flux in the coarse-grained phase space. Remarkably, the flux for the system
with the activity lower than the MIPS threshold tends to ``tear up"" the single
potential well of the uniform-density phase to create two wells of phases with
different densities, presenting directly that the nonequilibrium flux is the

  Robust Picking against Depth and Tilt Errors","8 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Applying suction grippers in unstructured environments is a challenging task
because of depth and tilt errors in vision systems, requiring additional costs
in elaborate sensing and control. To reduce additional costs, suction grippers
with compliant bodies or mechanisms have been proposed; however, their
bulkiness and limited allowable error hinder their use in complex environments
with large errors. Here, we propose a compact suction gripper that can pick
objects over a wide range of distances and tilt angles without elaborate
sensing and control. The spring-inserted gripper body deploys and conforms to
distant and tilted objects until the suction cup completely seals with the
object and retracts immediately after, while holding the object. This seamless
deployment and retraction is enabled by connecting the gripper body and suction
cup to the same vacuum source, which couples the vacuum picking and retraction
of the gripper body. Experimental results validated that the proposed gripper
can pick objects within 79 mm, which is 1.4 times the initial length, and can
pick objects with tilt angles up to 60{\deg}. The feasibility of the gripper
was verified by demonstrations, including picking objects of different heights
from the same picking height and the bin picking of transparent objects.

elliptical sweeps of keV electrons, by means of 500 MHz radio frequency field.
By converting a time distribution of incident electrons to a hit position
distribution on a circle or ellipse, this device achieves extremely precise
timing. Streak Cameras, based on similar principles, routinely operate in the
ps and sub-ps time domain, but have substantial slow readout system. Here, we
report a device, where the position sensor, consisting of microchannel plates
and a delay-line anode, produces ~ns duration pulses which can be processed by
using regular fast electronics. A photon sensor based on this technique, the
Radio Frequency Photo-Multiplier Tube (RFPMT), has demonstrated a timing
resolution of ~10 ps and a time stability of ~0.5 ps, FWHM. This makes the
apparatus highly suited for Time Correlated Single Photon Counting which is
widely used in optical microscopy and tomography of biological samples. The
first application in lifetime measurements of quantum states of graphene, under
construction at the A. I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory (AANL), is

In
this paper, we specialize in one specific problem, Visual Defect Detection
(VDD), in many industrial applications. And in practice, defect image samples
are very rare and difficult to collect. Thus, we focus on the unsupervised
visual defect detection and localization tasks and propose a novel framework
based on the recent score-based generative models, which synthesize the real
image by iterative denoising through stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
Our work is inspired by the fact that with noise injected into the original
image, the defects may be changed into normal cases in the denoising process
(i.e., reconstruction). First, based on the assumption that the anomalous data
lie in the low probability density region of the normal data distribution, we
explain a common phenomenon that occurs when reconstruction-based approaches
are applied to VDD: normal pixels also change during the reconstruction
process. Second, due to the differences in normal pixels between the
reconstructed and original images, a time-dependent gradient value (i.e.,
score) of normal data distribution is utilized as a metric, rather than
reconstruction loss, to gauge the defects. Third, a novel $T$ scales approach
is developed to dramatically reduce the required number of iterations,
accelerating the inference process. These practices allow our model to
generalize VDD in an unsupervised manner while maintaining reasonably good
performance. We evaluate our method on several datasets to demonstrate its
effectiveness.

perturbations to inputs; that is, they make correct and confident predictions
even when given largely perturbed inputs from which humans can not correctly
derive answers. In addition, QA models fail to generalize to other domains and
adversarial test sets, while humans maintain high accuracy. Based on these
observations, we assume that QA models do not use intended features necessary
for human reading but rely on spurious features, causing the lack of
generalization ability. Therefore, we attempt to answer the question: If the
overconfident predictions of QA models for various types of perturbations are
penalized, will the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization be improved? To
prevent models from making confident predictions on perturbed inputs, we first
follow existing studies and maximize the entropy of the output probability for
perturbed inputs. However, we find that QA models trained to be sensitive to a
certain perturbation type are often insensitive to unseen types of
perturbations. Thus, we simultaneously maximize the entropy for the four
perturbation types (i.e., word- and sentence-level shuffling and deletion) to
further close the gap between models and humans. Contrary to our expectations,
although models become sensitive to the four types of perturbations, we find
that the OOD generalization is not improved. Moreover, the OOD generalization
is sometimes degraded after entropy maximization. Making unconfident
predictions on largely perturbed inputs per se may be beneficial to gaining
human trust. However, our negative results suggest that researchers should pay
attention to the side effect of entropy maximization.

discover the fact that both mean and variance of the weight distribution of

The existing GFSL methods attempt to make the weight norms balanced, which we
find helps only the variance part, but discard the importance of mean of

effectively control both mean and variance of the weight distribution of novel

Neural EA methods dominate current EA research but still suffer from their
reliance on labelled mappings. To solve this problem, a few works have explored
boosting the training of EA models with self-training, which adds confidently
predicted mappings into the training data iteratively. Though the effectiveness
of self-training can be glimpsed in some specific settings, we still have very
limited knowledge about it. One reason is the existing works concentrate on
devising EA models and only treat self-training as an auxiliary tool. To fill
this knowledge gap, we change the perspective to self-training to shed light on
it. In addition, the existing self-training strategies have limited impact
because they introduce either much False Positive noise or a low quantity of
True Positive pseudo mappings. To improve self-training for EA, we propose
exploiting the dependencies between entities, a particularity of EA, to
suppress the noise without hurting the recall of True Positive mappings.
Through extensive experiments, we show that the introduction of dependency
makes the self-training strategy for EA reach a new level. The value of
self-training in alleviating the reliance on annotation is actually much higher
than what has been realised. Furthermore, we suggest future study on smart data
annotation to break the ceiling of EA performance.

this ""decorated"" HOD model for both low- and high-luminosity galaxies in SDSS

bounds on the cumulative regret are loose, whereas available PAC-Bayes lower

PAC-Bayes bound was able to learn randomised neural network polices with
competitive expected reward and non-vacuous performance guarantees.

extension naturally improves the computational capacity of SNNs. Our SNN model
outperformed comparable SNN models and achieved as high accuracy as
non-convolutional artificial neural networks. The spike count property of our
networks was altered depending on the time constant of the postsynaptic current

carried out 3 mm high-sensitivity observations toward two positions in the

emission peaks (at a distance of $\sim$5000 au from the core's centre). Our
observations reveal that a lower number of COMs and COM precursors are detected
in L1517B with respect to L1498 and L1544, and also show lower abundances.
Besides methanol, we only detected CH$_3$O, H$_2$CCO, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN,
CH$_3$NC, HCCCN, and HCCNC. Their measured abundances are $\sim$3 times larger
toward the methanol peak than toward the core's centre, mimicking the behaviour

evolved one, followed by L1498 and L1544. Chemical complexity in these cores
seems to increase over time, with N-bearing molecules forming first and
O-bearing COMs forming at a later stage as a result of the catastrophic

An important aim is to intervene early if anomalous events or adverse health is
detected. In the wild, these anomaly detection approaches are challenged by
noise, label scarcity, high dimensionality, explainability and wide variability
in operating environments. The Contextual Matrix Profile (CMP) is a
configurable 2-dimensional version of the Matrix Profile (MP) that uses the
distance matrix of all subsequences of a time series to discover patterns and
anomalies. The CMP is shown to enhance the effectiveness of the MP and other
SOTA methods at detecting, visualising and interpreting true anomalies in noisy
real world data from different domains. It excels at zooming out and
identifying temporal patterns at configurable time scales. However, the CMP
does not address cross-sensor information, and cannot scale to high dimensional
data. We propose a novel, self-supervised graph-based approach for temporal
anomaly detection that works on context graphs generated from the CMP distance
matrix. The learned graph embeddings encode the anomalous nature of a time
context. In addition, we evaluate other graph outlier algorithms for the same
task. Given our pipeline is modular, graph construction, generation of graph
embeddings, and pattern recognition logic can all be chosen based on the
specific pattern detection application. We verified the effectiveness of
graph-based anomaly detection and compared it with the CMP and 3 state-of-the

of individual authors, special methods of working with bibliographic data with
a predominant share of non-English authors are used. The properties of gender
mixing, the likelihood of male and female authors occupying the first position

data set containing bibliographic records related to Ukrainian journal
publications in the field of Economics is constructed using Crossref metadata.
The described stages for working with such specific data help to work at the
level of authors and analyse, in particular, gender issues. Despite the larger
number of female authors, gender equality is more likely to be reported at the
individual level for the discipline of Ukrainian Economics. The tendencies
towards collaborative or solo-publications and gender mixing patterns are found
to be dependent on the journal: the differences for publications indexed in
Scopus and/or Web of Science databases are found. It has also been found that
Ukrainian Economics research is characterized by rather a non-alphabetical
order of authors. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale quantitative
study of Ukrainian Economic discipline. The results obtained are valuable not
only at the national level, but also contribute to general knowledge about

with same order of RKKY and DM interaction, a nonlinear characteristic of the
magnetization oscillation is observed. However, this nonlinearity of
oscillations can be reduced by an external magnetic field or considering a
material with suitable RZ interaction. In addition to this, our study reveals
the magnetization switching can be tuned by using suitable STT. A dependence of
switching time on layer thickness is also observed. Also, the switching speed
increases with the thickness for systems having either same order of RKKY and
DM interaction or dominated by RKKY interaction. An opposite characteristic is
seen when DM interaction dominates over RKKY interaction.

including time-lock puzzles, verifiable delay functions, and accumulators. In
this paper we focus on trustless setup: in this setting, the most popular
unknown-order group construction is ideal class groups of imaginary quadratic
fields. We argue that the full impact of Sutherland's generic group-order
algorithm has not been recognised in this context, and show that group sizes
currently being proposed in practice (namely, approximately 830 bits) do not
meet the claimed security level. Instead, we claim that random group orders
should be at least 3300 bits to meet a 128-bit security level. For ideal class
groups this leads to discriminants of around 6656 bits, which are much larger
than desirable. One drawback of class groups is that current approaches require
approximately $2\log_2(N)$ bits to represent an element in a group of order N.
We provide two solutions to mitigate this blow-up in the size of
representations. First, we explain how an idea of Bleichenbacher can be used to
compress class group elements to $(3/2)\log_2(N)$ bits. Second, we note that
using Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves (in other words, class groups of
quadratic function fields) allows efficient compression to the optimal element
representation size of $\log_2(N)$ bits. We discuss point-counting approaches
for hyperelliptic curves and argue that genus-3 curves are secure in the
trustless unknown-order setting. We conclude that in practice, Jacobians of
hyperelliptic curves are more efficient in practice than ideal class groups at
the same security level -- both in the group operation and in the size of the
element representation.

of the Cold Spot is an unusually large void on the line of sight, that would
generate a cold region through the combination of integrated Sachs-Wolfe and

determine the magnitude of the Kondo condensate which is a particle pairing
composed of conducting Dirac fermions and localized impurities. We focus on the
competition between the Kondo effect and the energy gap formation that stems
from the pairing among the Dirac fermions leading to the dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking. We find that this competition induces a quantum critical
point. We also investigate finite-temperature effects. This system at vanishing
fermion density can be studied with Monte Carlo lattice simulations which do

generation, which exceeds GANs in quality in many circumstances. However, their
slow training and inference speed is a huge bottleneck, blocking them from
being used in real-time applications. A recent DiffusionGAN method
significantly decreases the models' running time by reducing the number of
sampling steps from thousands to several, but their speeds still largely lag
behind the GAN counterparts. This paper aims to reduce the speed gap by
proposing a novel wavelet-based diffusion scheme. We extract low-and-high
frequency components from both image and feature levels via wavelet
decomposition and adaptively handle these components for faster processing
while maintaining good generation quality. Furthermore, we propose to use a
reconstruction term, which effectively boosts the model training convergence.

conserves their difference $(\mathcal{B}-\mathcal{L})$. Neutron stars contain a
large number of neutrons and thus the $nn \rightarrow \bar{\chi}\bar{\chi}$
process can be greatly enhanced inside a neutron star. This process could
result in non-trivial effects that are different from the SM predictions and
can be explored through astrophysical and laboratory observations. Furthermore,
a large number of sterile antineutrinos, which may be dark matter candidates,
can be emitted from the interior of the neutron star. The properties of the
emitted particles show a particular pattern that can be uniquely determined by
the mass and radius of the neutron star. In addition, the dineutron decay may
contribute to the orbital-period change of the binary systems containing
neutron stars. We analyze the possibility to constrain the mass of the new

is found that the mass of the new scalar bosons is roughly restricted in the
range from 1 TeV to several TeV, which is possibly within the reach of direct

increase mobilities by orders of magnitude over conventional hopping, making it
important for materials and device design. Although delocalisation, disorder,
and polaron formation can be described using delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo

kinetic Monte Carlo (jKMC), a model that approaches the accuracy of dKMC with a
computational cost comparable to conventional hopping. jKMC achieves its
computational performance by modelling conduction using identical spherical
polarons, yielding a simple delocalisation correction to the Marcus hopping
rate that allows polarons to jump over their nearest neighbours. jKMC can be

applied to data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of the $N$-component

models to a two-parameter family of models. The two-parameter space is scanned
for the point, where the amplitudes of the two leading corrections to scaling
vanish. To this end, a dimensionless quantity is introduced that monitors the
breaking of the $O(N)$-invariance. For $N=4$, we determine the correction
exponents $\omega_1=0.763(24)$ and $\omega_2=0.082(5)$. In the case of $N=3$,
we obtain $Y_4=0.0142(6)$ for the RG-exponent of the cubic perturbation at the
$O(3)$-invariant fixed point, while the correction exponent
$\omega_2=0.0133(8)$ at the cubic fixed point. Simulations close to the
improved point result in the estimates $\nu=0.7202(7)$ and $\eta=0.0371(2)$ of
the critical exponents of the cubic fixed point for $N=4$. For $N=3$, at the
cubic fixed point, the $O(3)$-symmetry is only mildly broken and the critical
exponents differ only by little from those of the $O(3)$-invariant fixed point.
We find $-0.00001 \lessapprox \eta_{cubic}- \eta_{O(3)} \lessapprox 0.00007$

studying the impact of resetting for different mortality regimes, we also show
that, if the average lifetime $ \tau_\mu=1/\mu $ is long enough with respect to

CAR-FT makes the context-aware ability of CLIP inherited into downstream tasks,

five OOD test datasets of ImageNet, and meanwhile brings accuracy gains on nine

an alphabet of symbols conveniently chosen. In this work we attack both

map into a symbolic sequence. For advancing in the first task we work with the
family of divergences known as the Burbea-Rao centroids (BRC) and for the

technological advances in the field of quantum machines, here we look for
corrections to work fluctuations theorems when the acting system is allowed to
enter the quantum domain. This entails including the acting system in the
dynamics and letting it share a nonclassical state with the system acted upon.
Moreover, favoring a mechanical perspective to this program, we employ a

the autonomous dynamics of a two-particle system with an elastic coupling. For

of systems ranging from synthetic grafted nanoparticles to viruses. The
morphology and number of the decorating groups can vary widely between systems.
Thus, the modelling of functionalized NPs typically considers simplified
spherical objects as a first-order approximation. At the nanoscale label,
complex hydrodynamic interactions are expected to emerge as the morphological
features of the particles change, and they can be further amplified when the
NPs are confined or near walls. Direct estimation of these variations can be
inferred via diffusion coefficients of the NPs. However, the evaluation of the
coefficients requires an improved representation of the NPs morphology to
reproduce important features hidden by simplified spherical models. Here, we
characterize the passive transport of free and confined functionalized
nanoparticles using the Rigid Multi-Blob (RMB) method. The main advantage of
RMB is its versatility to approximate the mobility of complex structures at the
nanoscale with significant accuracy and reduced computational cost. In
particular, we investigate the effect of functional groups distribution, size
and morphology over nanoparticle translational and rotational diffusion. We
identify that the presence of functional groups significantly affects the
rotational diffusion of the nanoparticles, moreover, the morphology of the
groups and number induce characteristic mobility reduction compared to
non-functionalized nanoparticles. Confined NPs also evidenced important
alterations in their diffusivity, with distinctive signatures in the
off-diagonal contributions of the rotational diffusion. These results can be
exploited in various applications, including biomedical, polymer nanocomposite
fabrication, drug delivery, and imaging

existing methods usually require strong distributional assumptions on the noise

applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a new method, called
\emph{residual permutation test} (RPT), which is constructed by projecting the
regression residuals onto the space orthogonal to the union of the column
spaces of the original and permuted design matrices. RPT can be proved to
achieve finite-population size validity under fixed design with just
exchangeable noises, whenever $p < n / 2$. Moreover, RPT is shown to be
asymptotically powerful for heavy tailed noises with bounded $(1+t)$-th order
moment when the true coefficient is at least of order $n^{-t/(1+t)}$ for $t \in
[0,1]$. We further proved that this signal size requirement is essentially
optimal in the minimax sense. Numerical studies confirm that RPT performs well
in a wide range of simulation settings with normal and heavy-tailed noise

therefore commonly adopted in industry. Recent work has shown that
floating-point neural networks that have been verified to be robust can become
vulnerable to adversarial attacks after quantization, and certification of the
quantized representation is necessary to guarantee robustness. In this work, we
present quantization-aware interval bound propagation (QA-IBP), a novel method
for training robust QNNs. Inspired by advances in robust learning of
non-quantized networks, our training algorithm computes the gradient of an
abstract representation of the actual network. Unlike existing approaches, our
method can handle the discrete semantics of QNNs. Based on QA-IBP, we also
develop a complete verification procedure for verifying the adversarial

maintaining accuracy, a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN), PINN-Stress
model, is proposed to predict the entire sequence of stress distribution based
on Finite Element simulations using a partial differential equation (PDE)
solver. Using automatic differentiation, we embed a PDE into a deep neural
network's loss function to incorporate information from measurements and PDEs.
The PINN-Stress model can predict the sequence of stress distribution in almost
real-time and can generalize better than the model without PINN.

data modeling and is designed to integrate heterogeneous data at instance and
schema level using statements. While RDF is conceptually simple, data models
nevertheless get complex, when complex data needs to be represented. Additional
levels of indirection with intermediate resources instead of simple properties
lead to higher barriers for prospective users of the data. Based on three
patterns, we argue that shifting information to a meta-level can not only be
used to (1) provide provenance information, but can also help to (2) maintain
backwards compatibility for existing models, and to (3) reduce the complexity
of a data model. There are, however, multiple ways in RDF to use a meta-level,
i.e., to provide additional statements about statements. With Named Graphs,
there exists a well-established mechanism to describe groups of statements.
Since its inception, however, it has been hard to make statements about single
statements. With the introduction of RDF-star, a new way to provide data about
single statements is now available. We show that the combination of RDF-star
and Named Graphs is a viable solution to express data on a meta-level and
propose that this meta-level should be used as first class citizen in data
modeling.

Building an ML model in this context, involves encoding the information of
chemical environments using local atomic descriptors. In this work, we focus on
the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) and their application in studying
the properties of liquid water both in the bulk and at the hydrophobic
air-water interface. By using a statistical test aimed at assessing the
relative information content of different distance measures defined on the same
data space, we investigate if these descriptors provide the same information as
some of the common order parameters that are used to characterize local water
structure such as hydrogen bonding, density or tetrahedrality to name a few.
Our analysis suggests that the ML description and the standard order parameters
of local water structure are not equivalent. In particular, a combination of
these order parameters probing local water environments can predict SOAP
similarity only approximately, and viceversa, the environments that are similar
according to SOAP are not necessarily similar according to the standard order
parameters. We also elucidate the role of some of the metaparameters entering
in the SOAP definition in encoding chemical information.

challenge for LReID is how to incrementally preserve old knowledge and

forgetting on old tasks but also aiming to improve the model performance on
both new and old tasks during the lifelong learning process. Inspired by the
biological process of human cognition where the somatosensory neocortex and the
hippocampus work together in memory consolidation, we formulated a model called
Knowledge Refreshing and Consolidation (KRC) that achieves both positive
forward and backward transfer. More specifically, a knowledge refreshing scheme
is incorporated with the knowledge rehearsal mechanism to enable bi-directional
knowledge transfer by introducing a dynamic memory model and an adaptive

$O(\log\log n)$-competitive algorithms with $O(1)$ amortized recourse due to

  Along the way, we design an algorithm for the online generalized network flow
problem (also known as network flow problem with gains) with recourse. In the
problem, any edge $uv$ in the network has a gain parameter $\gamma_{uv} > 0$
and $\theta$-units of flow sent across $uv$ from $u$'s side becomes
$\gamma_{uv} \theta$ units of flow on the $v$'th side. In the online problem,
there is one sink, and sources come one by one. Upon arrival of a source, we
need to send 1 unit flow from the source. A recourse occurs if we change the
flow value of an edge. We give an online algorithm for the problem with
recourse at most $O(1/\epsilon)$ times the optimum cost for the instance with
capacities scaled by $\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}$. The $(1+\epsilon)$-factor improves
upon the corresponding $(2+\epsilon)$-factor of [GKS14], which only works for

water (ASW). Although ASW is widely studied, vibrational energy dissipation and
structural changes due to vibrational excitation are less well understood. The
hydrogen-bonding network is likely a crucial component in this. Here we present
experimental results on hydrogen-bonding changes in ASW induced by the intense,
nearly monochromatic mid-IR free-electron laser (FEL) radiation of the FELIX-2
beamline at the HFML-FELIX facility at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the
Netherlands. Structural changes in ASW are monitored by reflection-absorption
infrared spectroscopy and depend on the irradiation history of the ice. The
experiments show that FEL irradiation can induce changes in the local
neighborhood of the excited molecules due to energy transfer. Molecular
Dynamics simulations confirm this picture: vibrationally excited molecules can
reorient for a more optimal tetrahedral surrounding without breaking existing
hydrogen bonds. The vibrational energy can transfer through the
hydrogen-bonding network to water molecules that have the same vibrational
frequency. We hence expect a reduced energy dissipation in amorphous material
with respect to crystalline material due to the inhomogeneity in vibrational
frequencies as well as the presence of specific hydrogen-bonding defect sites
which can also hamper the energy transfer.

this paper, we break this barrier and derive closed-form expressions for the

evaluate, which allows us to set up an efficient MCMC sampler with adaptive

shortcut solutions rather than the solutions intended by QA datasets. QA models
that have learned shortcut solutions can achieve human-level performance in
shortcut examples where shortcuts are valid, but these same behaviors degrade
generalization potential on anti-shortcut examples where shortcuts are invalid.
Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this problem, but they do not
fully take the characteristics of shortcuts themselves into account. We assume
that the learnability of shortcuts, i.e., how easy it is to learn a shortcut,
is useful to mitigate the problem. Thus, we first examine the learnability of
the representative shortcuts on extractive and multiple-choice QA datasets.
Behavioral tests using biased training sets reveal that shortcuts that exploit
answer positions and word-label correlations are preferentially learned for
extractive and multiple-choice QA, respectively. We find that the more
learnable a shortcut is, the flatter and deeper the loss landscape is around
the shortcut solution in the parameter space. We also find that the
availability of the preferred shortcuts tends to make the task easier to
perform from an information-theoretic viewpoint. Lastly, we experimentally show
that the learnability of shortcuts can be utilized to construct an effective QA
training set; the more learnable a shortcut is, the smaller the proportion of
anti-shortcut examples required to achieve comparable performance on shortcut
and anti-shortcut examples. We claim that the learnability of shortcuts should
be considered when designing mitigation methods.

become one of the most important but challenging issues for the cloud computing
community, especially for practical heterogeneous request sequences. By
analyzing the impact of request heterogeneity on some popular heuristic
schedulers, it can be found that existing scheduling algorithms can not handle
the request heterogeneity properly and efficiently. In this paper, a
plug-and-play virtual machine scheduling intensifier, called Resource Assigner
(ReAssigner), is proposed to enhance the scheduling efficiency of any given
scheduler for heterogeneous requests. The key idea of ReAssigner is to
pre-assign roles to physical resources and let resources of the same role form
a virtual cluster to handle homogeneous requests. ReAssigner can cooperate with
arbitrary schedulers by restricting their scheduling space to virtual clusters.
With evaluations on the real dataset from Huawei Cloud, the proposed ReAssigner
achieves significant scheduling performance improvement compared with some
state-of-the-art scheduling methods.

data, that is data that exists outside of the distribution of a model's
training data. Training is often performed using limited, carefully curated
datasets and so when a model is deployed there is often a significant
distribution shift as edge cases and anomalies not included in the training
data are encountered. To address this, we propose the Input Optimisation
Network, an image preprocessing model that learns to optimise input data for a
specific target vision model. In this work we investigate several
out-of-distribution scenarios in the context of semantic segmentation for
autonomous vehicles, comparing an Input Optimisation based solution to existing
approaches of finetuning the target model with augmented training data and an
adversarially trained preprocessing model. We demonstrate that our approach can
enable performance on such data comparable to that of a finetuned model, and
subsequently that a combined approach, whereby an input optimization network is
optimised to target a finetuned model, delivers superior performance to either
method in isolation. Finally, we propose a joint optimisation approach, in
which input optimization network and target model are trained simultaneously,
which we demonstrate achieves significant further performance gains,
particularly in challenging edge-case scenarios. We also demonstrate that our
architecture can be reduced to a relatively compact size without a significant
performance impact, potentially facilitating real time embedded applications.

discrepancy between two distributions and can faithfully determine the

i.e., a fixed level of task difficulty, is usually sub-optimal for a growing
student during its progressive learning stages. In this paper, we propose a
simple curriculum-based technique, termed Curriculum Temperature for Knowledge
Distillation (CTKD), which controls the task difficulty level during the
student's learning career through a dynamic and learnable temperature.
Specifically, following an easy-to-hard curriculum, we gradually increase the
distillation loss w.r.t. the temperature, leading to increased distillation
difficulty in an adversarial manner. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, CTKD
can be seamlessly integrated into existing knowledge distillation frameworks
and brings general improvements at a negligible additional computation cost.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-2012, and MS-COCO demonstrate the

states including squeezed state, cat state, and entangled state in different
parameter regimes. In this paper, we firstly use the polaron picture to figure
out the process of superradiant phase transition (SPT) in view of the
nonclassical states. According to the polaron wave functions, the squeezed
state extends to whole parameter regimes, and a small but non-zero weighted
antipolaron is necessary to form novel semi-cat states. Moreover, the behavior
of superradiance in the QRM can be viewed as the same displacement of the cat
states from zero to a finite value, while the ground state becomes entangled
state resulting from the emergence of spin-up state. On the other hand, the
nonclassical states can be intuitively characterized by the Wigner functions
with analytical expressions in the polaron picture, and the Wigner negativity
is also evaluated to measure the nonclassicality. Based on the squeezing and
superradiance, a classification of the coupling strength for the nonclassical
states containing in the ground state is presented, and the process of the SPT
is also revealed by the photon number distribution in Fock space, which is
important to understand the fundamental quantum physics in the QRM. Our work
provides a guidance for preparing the nonclassical states in experiments based

traditional vulnerability mining methods rely on vulnerability detection tools

cannot be applied to large-scale power big data fields. Objective: The goal of
the research is to intelligently detect vulnerabilities in source codes of
high-level languages such as C/C++. This enables us to propose a code
representation of sensitive sentence-related slices of source code, and to
detect vulnerabilities by designing a distributed deep ensemble learning model.
Method: In this paper, a new directional vulnerability mining method of
parallel ensemble learning is proposed to solve the problem of large-scale data
vulnerability mining. By extracting sensitive functions and statements, a
sensitive statement library of vulnerable codes is formed. The AST stream-based
vulnerability code slice with higher granularity performs doc2vec sentence
vectorization on the source code through the random sampling module, obtains
different classification results through distributed training through the
Bi-LSTM trainer, and obtains the final classification result by voting.
Results: This method designs and implements a distributed deep ensemble
learning system software vulnerability mining system called DCDetector. It can
make accurate predictions by using the syntactic information of the code, and
is an effective method for analyzing large-scale vulnerability data.
Conclusion: Experiments show that this method can reduce the false positive
rate of traditional static analysis and improve the performance and accuracy of
machine learning.

non-migrating planets accreting from the same gaseous disk. We find that the
evolution of the planets' mass ratio depends on gap formation. However, in all

similar masses (0.9 $<m_{p,out}/m_{p,in}<$ 1.1 after 0.5 Myrs). Delaying the

observed mass ratios of exoplanets, the planets must start accreting gas at
different times, and their accretion must be stopped quickly after the
beginning of runaway gas accretion (less than 0.5 Myrs), for example via disk
dispersal. The evolution of the planets' mass ratio can have an important
impact on the dynamics of the system and may constrain the formation history of

treatment variable and independent of all other variables in the system.
However, it is challenging to search for a standard IV from data directly due
to the strict conditions. The conditional IV (CIV) method has been proposed to
allow a variable to be an instrument conditioning on a set of variables,
allowing a wider choice of possible IVs and enabling broader practical
applications of the IV approach. Nevertheless, there is not a data-driven
method to discover a CIV and its conditioning set directly from data. To fill
this gap, in this paper, we propose to learn the representations of the
information of a CIV and its conditioning set from data with latent confounders
for average causal effect estimation. By taking advantage of deep generative
models, we develop a novel data-driven approach for simultaneously learning the
representation of a CIV from measured variables and generating the
representation of its conditioning set given measured variables. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method
outperforms the existing IV methods.

threats to safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Robust
training and defend-by-denoise are typical strategies for defending adversarial
perturbations, including adversarial training and statistical filtering,

rely heavily upon specified noise priors, limiting generalized robustness
against attacks of all kinds. This paper introduces a new defense mechanism
based on denoising diffusion models that can adaptively remove diverse noises
with a tailored intensity estimator. Specifically, we first estimate
adversarial distortions by calculating the distance of the points to their
neighborhood best-fit plane. Depending on the distortion degree, we choose
specific diffusion time steps for the input point cloud and perform the forward
diffusion to disrupt potential adversarial shifts. Then we conduct the reverse
denoising process to restore the disrupted point cloud back to a clean
distribution. This approach enables effective defense against adaptive attacks
with varying noise budgets, achieving accentuated robustness of existing 3D

fragmentation approach for molecular dimers and aggregates by comparing with
the full LC-TD-DFTB method. The comparison of the calculated spectra of an
anthracene cluster shows a very good agreement between our method and the
LC-TD-DFTB reference. The effective computational scaling of our method has
been explored for anthracene clusters and for perylene bisimide aggregates. We
demonstrate the applicability of our method by the calculation of the excited

Furthermore, the participation ratio of the monomer fragments to the excited
states is analyzed by the calculation of natural transition orbital (NTO)
participation numbers, which are verified by the hole and particle density for
a chosen pentacene cluster. The use of our FMO-LC-TDDFTB method will allow for

studies proposed a new model, called \emph{value maximizer}, for auto-bidding

this work, we address this issue by proposing a payment rule which combines the
corresponding ones in classical VCG and GSP mechanisms in a novel way. Based on
this payment rule, we propose a truthful auction mechanism with an
approximation ratio of $2$ on social welfare, which is close to the lower bound

a generalization of VCG for utility maximizers and GSP for value maximizers.

proposed formulation is an extension of the conservative, high-order numerical
method previously developed by Johnson and Kercher [J. Comput. Phys., 423
(2020), 109826] that maintains pressure equilibrium between adjacent elements.
In this first part of our two-part paper, we focus on the one-dimensional case.
Our methodology is rooted in the minimum entropy principle satisfied by entropy
solutions to the multicomponent, compressible Euler equations, which was proved
by Gouasmi et al. [ESAIM: Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 54 (2020), 373--389] for
nonreacting flows. We first show that the minimum entropy principle holds in
the reacting case as well. Next, we introduce the ingredients required for the
solution to have nonnegative species concentrations, positive density, positive
pressure, and bounded entropy. We also discuss how to retain the aforementioned
ability to preserve pressure equilibrium between elements. Operator splitting
is employed to handle stiff chemical reactions. To guarantee satisfaction of
the minimum entropy principle in the reaction step, we develop an
entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin method based on diagonal-norm
summation-by-parts operators for solving ordinary differential equations. The
developed formulation is used to compute canonical one-dimensional test cases,
namely thermal-bubble advection, multicomponent shock-tube flow, and a moving
hydrogen-oxygen detonation wave with detailed chemistry. We find that the
enforcement of an entropy bound can considerably reduce the large-scale
nonlinear instabilities that emerge when only the positivity property is
enforced, to an even greater extent than in the monocomponent, calorically
perfect case.

applying a bias voltage, the charge energy corresponding to a baseline of the
59.54 keV $\gamma$ rays from a $^{241}$Am source is amplified for a short
period of time and then decreases back to the baseline. The amplification of
charge energy depends strongly on the applied positive bias voltage with
drifting holes across the detector. No such phenomenon is visible with drifting
electrons across the detector. We find that the observed charge amplification
is dictated by the impact ionization of charged states, which has a strong
correlation with impurity level and applied electric field. We analyze the
dominant physics mechanisms that are responsible for the creation and the
impact ionization of charged states. Our analysis suggests that the appropriate
level of impurity in a Ge detector can enhance charge yield through the impact
ionization of charged states to achieve extremely low-energy detection
threshold ($<$ 10 meV) for MeV-scale dark matter searches if the charge

the mechanophore blocks experience significant many-body intra-molecular
distortion that can significantly decrease the activation barrier as compared

$U^{\rm LR}_{\rm eff}$ is almost stable at about 6.0 eV (except for Eu, Er and

scheme to analyze coexistence and competition between the orbital localization
and the screening effect. We find that LSCC and cRPA are dominated by the
orbital localization and the screening effect, respectively, whereas LR shows a
balance of the competition between the two factors. Additionally, the
performance of these approaches is influenced by different starting points from

similar variation distributions. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show

fundamental properties of the early stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions
up to the formation of a minimal-viscosity quark-gluon fluid. However, there
have been few attempts to extend its application beyond this stage. Here we
explore the prospects for such an extension beyond the time of hadronization.
Our discussion makes use of recent insights into the duality of entanglement
properties of field theory states in the edge of Anti-de Sitter space and
non-trivial topologies of horizons in the bulk, often referred to as ER = EPR

phenomenology, review several relevant concepts, and map out a path toward
combining them into a comprehensive, at least semiquantitative description of
relativistic heavy ion collisions. We outline possible next steps in this

during USAR missions. The proposed method extends a feature based Visual
monocular SLAM (OpenVSLAM, based on the popular ORB-SLAM) for robust long-term
localization on equirectangular video input by adding an additional
densification thread that computes dense correspondences for any given keyframe
with respect to a local keyframe-neighboorhood using a
PatchMatch-Stereo-approach. While PatchMatch-Stereo-types of algorithms are
considered state of the art for large scale Mutli-View-Stereo they had not been
adapted so far for real-time dense 3d reconstruction tasks. This work describes
a new massively parallel variant of the PatchMatch-Stereo-algorithm that
differs from current approaches in two ways: First it supports the
equirectangular camera model while other solutions are limited to the pinhole
camera model. Second it is optimized for low latency while keeping a high level
of completeness and accuracy. To achieve this it operates only on small
sequences of keyframes, but employs techniques to compensate for the potential
loss of accuracy due to the limited number of frames. Results demonstrate that
dense 3d reconstruction is possible on a consumer grade laptop with a recent
mobile GPU and that it is possible with improved accuracy and completeness over
common offline-MVS solutions with comparable quality settings.

knowledge gained from a training task by assigning appropriate labels of

investigated individual approaches to these categories, the experiments in

work of the first author, in which this information was obtained from
forwards-in-time dynamics using a novel stochastic partial differential
equations approach for spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot models. The latter was
introduced by Barton, Etheridge and V\'eber as a framework to model the
evolution of the genetic composition of a spatially structured population.
Reproduction takes place through extinction-recolonisation events driven by a
Poisson point process. In events, in certain areas, a parent is sampled and a
proportion of the population is replaced. We generalize the previous approach
to spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot models by allowing the area from which a
parent is sampled during events to differ from the area in which offspring are
dispersed, and the radii of these regions follow power-law distributions. In
particular, while in previous works the motion of ancestral lineages and
coalescence behaviour were closely linked, we demonstrate that local and
non-local coalescence is possible for ancestral lineages governed by both
fractional and standard Laplacians.

increases drastically, a response known as discontinuous shear-thickening
(DST). In some cases, the applied stress can even transform the suspension into
a solid-like shear jammed state. Although shear jamming (SJ) has been probed
for dense suspensions with particles having well-defined shapes, such a
phenomenon for fractal objects has not been explored. Here, using rheology and
in situ optical imaging, we study the flow behaviour of ultra-dilute fractal
suspensions of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) under confinement. We show
a direct transition from flowing to SJ state without a precursory DST in
fractal suspensions at an onset volume fraction, $\phi \sim$ 0.5\%,
significantly lower than that of conventional dense suspensions ($\phi \sim$
55\%). The ultra-low concentration enables us to demonstrate the fragility and
associated contact dynamics of the SJ state, which remain experimentally
unexplored in suspensions. Furthermore, using a generalized Wyart-Cates model,
we propose a generic phase diagram for fractal suspensions that captures the
possibility of SJ without prior DST over a wide range of shear stress and
volume fractions.

representation learning with self-attention operators. Although these operators
provide flexibility to the model with their adjustable attention kernels, they
suffer from inherent limitations: (1) the attention kernel is not
discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy of the ViT layers, and (2)
the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence length.
In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called lightweight
structure-aware attention (LiSA), which has a better representation power with
log-linear complexity. Our operator learns structural patterns by using a set
of relative position embeddings (RPEs). To achieve log-linear complexity, the
RPEs are approximated with fast Fourier transforms. Our experiments and
ablation studies demonstrate that ViTs based on the proposed operator
outperform self-attention and other existing operators, achieving
state-of-the-art results on ImageNet, and competitive results on other visual

LocPoseNet, able to robustly learn location prior for unseen objects. Our

asymptotic equivalence of our Bayesian estimator and double robust frequentist

vice versa. Consequently, the resulting Bayesian point estimator internalizes
the bias correction as the frequentist-type doubly robust estimator, and the
Bayesian credible sets form confidence intervals with asymptotically exact
coverage probability. In simulations, we find that this robust Bayesian

calculate the gradient over each weight unit multiple times with a restart
scheme, and then we compute the expectation of all gradients. Finally, the
transferability between the source and target is estimated by computing the gap
of normalized principal gradients. Extensive experiments show that the proposed

  Topics on Twitter: A Case Study From Japan","9 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.SI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, social media has been criticized for yielding polarization.
Identifying emerging disagreements and growing polarization is important for
journalists to create alerts and provide more balanced coverage. While recent
studies have shown the existence of polarization on social media, they
primarily focused on limited topics such as politics with a large volume of
data collected in the long term, especially over months or years. While these
findings are helpful, they are too late to create an alert immediately. To
address this gap, we develop a domain-agnostic mining method to identify
polarized topics on Twitter in a short-term period, namely 12 hours. As a
result, we find that daily Japanese news-related topics in early 2022 were
polarized by 31.6\% within a 12-hour range. We also analyzed that they tend to
construct information diffusion networks with a relatively high average degree,
and half of the tweets are created by a relatively small number of people.
However, it is very costly and impractical to collect a large volume of tweets
daily on many topics and monitor the polarization due to the limitations of the
Twitter API. To make it more cost-efficient, we also develop a prediction
method using machine learning techniques to estimate the polarization level
using randomly collected tweets leveraging the network information. Extensive
experiments show a significant saving in collection costs compared to baseline
methods. In particular, our approach achieves F-score of 0.85, requiring 4,000
tweets, 4x savings than the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, our work is
the first to predict the polarization level of the topics with low-resource
tweets. Our findings have profound implications for the news media, allowing
journalists to detect and disseminate polarizing information quickly and
efficiently.

reference audio. We also fine-tune the multispeaker model to unseen speakers
with limited amounts of data, as a realistic application scenario and show that
the prosody control capabilities are maintained, verifying that the
speaker-independent prosodic clustering is effective. Experimental results show
that the model has high output speech quality and that the proposed method
allows efficient prosody control within each speaker's range despite the
variability that a multispeaker setting introduces.

scaling with system size of quantum chemical methods for the calculation of the
correlation energy like the direct random phase approximation (RPA) or
second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). PADF can however
introduce large errors in correlation energies as the two-electron interaction
energy is not guaranteed to be bounded from below. This issue can be partially
alleviated by using very large fit sets, but this comes at the price of reduced
efficiency and having to deal with near-linear dependencies in the fit set. In
this work, we introduce an alternative methodology to overcome this problem
that preserves the intrinsically favourable scaling of PADF. We first
regularize the Fock matrix by projecting out parts of the basis set which gives
rise to orbital products that are hard to describe by PADF. We then also apply
this projector to the orbital coefficient matrix to improve the precision of
PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA. We systematically assess the accuracy of this new
approach in a numerical atomic orbital framework using Slater Type Orbitals
(STO) and correlation consistent Gaussian type basis sets up to
quintuple-$\zeta$ quality for systems with more than 200 atoms. For the small
and medium systems in the S66 database we show the maximum deviation of
PADF-MP2 and PADF-RPA relative correlation energies to DF-MP2 and DF-RPA
reference results to be 0.07 and 0.14 kcal/mol respectively. When the new
projector method is used, the errors only slightly increase for large molecules
and also when moderately sized fit sets are used the resulting errors are well
under control. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of our
algorithm by calculating the interaction energies of non-covalently bound
complexes with more than 1000 atoms and 20000 atomic orbitals at the

the bulge of M31 in five far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV)
filters at 1"" spatial resolution. Models for the luminosity distribution of the
bulge are constructed using the UVIT data and the galaxy image-fitting

function the five images and find Sersic indices ($\simeq2.1$ to 2.5) similar
to previous studies but smaller $R_e$ values ($\simeq0.5$ to 0.6 kpc). When the

best-fit. We use an 8-component fit for the FUV 148nm image, which has the

of what is possible in theory and what is reasonable to expect in practice.
Granular forecasts in the regime of low count rates - as they often occur in

product, day, and location - are dominated by the inevitable statistical
uncertainty of the Poisson distribution. This makes it hard to judge whether a
certain metric value is dominated by Poisson noise or truly indicates a bad

scaling: Its value is mostly defined by the predicted selling rate and the

the forecast. For any metric, comparing two groups of forecasted products often
yields ""the slow movers are performing worse than the fast movers"" or vice

forecast, we stratify predictions into buckets of approximately equal rate and
evaluate metrics for each bucket separately. By comparing the achieved value

method enables an easy and intuitive analysis of similarities between two

which means a user can construct an edit (e.g. tucking a shirt in a specific
way) that can be applied to all shirts in a garment collection. Garment detail
is preserved by relying on a warping procedure to place the garment on the body

generation of pre-trained diffusion models. The approach introduces a
discriminator that gives explicit supervision to a denoising sample path
whether it is realistic or not. Unlike GANs, our approach does not require
joint training of score and discriminator networks. Instead, we train the
discriminator after score training, making discriminator training stable and
fast to converge. In sample generation, we add an auxiliary term to the
pre-trained score to deceive the discriminator. This term corrects the model
score to the data score at the optimal discriminator, which implies that the
discriminator helps better score estimation in a complementary way. Using our
algorithm, we achive state-of-the-art results on ImageNet 256x256 with FID 1.83

observatories, we observed 169 stars and detected 24 candidates companions, 16
of which are newly discovered and all but three are likely or confirmed
physical companions. Despite obtaining sensitivity down to the substellar limit
for 75\% of our sample, we do not detect any companion below 0.3 $M_\odot$,
strongly suggesting that the distribution of stellar companions is truncated at
a mass ratio of $q_\mathrm{min} \gtrsim0.075$. Combining our results with known
brown dwarf companions, we identify a low-mass companion desert to intermediate
mass stars in the range $0.02\lesssim q \lesssim0.05$, which quantitatively
matches the known brown dwarf desert among solar-type stars. We conclude that
the formation mechanism for multiple systems operates in a largely
scale-invariant manner and precludes the formation of extremely uneven systems,
likely because the components of a proto-binary accrete most of their mass
after the initial cloud fragmentation. Similarly, the mechanism to form
""planetary"" ($q \lesssim 0.02$) companions likely scales linearly with stellar
mass, probably as a result of the correlation between the masses of stars and
their protoplanetary disks. Finally, we predict the existence of a sizable
population of brown dwarf companions to low-mass stars and of a rising
population of planetary-mass objects towards $\approx 1\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ around
solar-type stars. Improvements on current instrumentation will test these
predictions.

issues in Quantum Field Theory. In this work we approach the problem by
considering mixing of neutrinos and computing the transition amplitude for the
paradigmatic neutron $\beta$-decay $n\,\rightarrow\, p \,+\,e^ \,+\,\bar\nu$.
Calculations are developed by utilizing the following different representations
of neutrino states: \emph{i}) Pontecorvo states, \emph{ii}) mass states and
\emph{iii}) exact QFT flavor states, which are defined as eigenstates of the
flavor charge. As a guiding principle, we invoke the conservation of lepton
charge in the interaction vertex, which is fundamentally inbuilt into the
Standard Model at tree level. In the short-time limit, we show that the only
fully consistent scenario is that based on QFT states, whereas the other two
frameworks contradict the underlying theory. This result provides a crucial
step towards understanding the r\^ole of neutrino mixing in weak decays and
contributes to elucidate the flavor/mass controversy in QFT.

pre-training framework (MMSpeech) for Mandarin automatic speech recognition

in speech-text joint pre-training comes from the significant difference between
speech and text modalities, especially for Mandarin speech and text. Unlike
English and other languages with an alphabetic writing system, Mandarin uses an
ideographic writing system where character and sound are not tightly mapped to
one another. Therefore, we propose to introduce the phoneme modality into
pre-training, which can help capture modality-invariant information between
Mandarin speech and text. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning
framework including five self-supervised and supervised tasks with speech and
text data. For end-to-end pre-training, we introduce self-supervised
speech-to-pseudo-codes (S2C) and phoneme-to-text (P2T) tasks utilizing
unlabeled speech and text data, where speech-pseudo-codes pairs and
phoneme-text pairs are a supplement to the supervised speech-text pairs. To
train the encoder to learn better speech representation, we introduce
self-supervised masked speech prediction (MSP) and supervised phoneme
prediction (PP) tasks to learn to map speech into phonemes. Besides, we
directly add the downstream supervised speech-to-text (S2T) task into the
pre-training process, which can further improve the pre-training performance
and achieve better recognition results even without fine-tuning. Experiments on
AISHELL-1 show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a more than 40% relative improvement compared with other pre-training
methods.

Optimization is a better choice for solving unstable problem because
steady-state solution is always the extreme point of optimization regardless of
whether the problem is unstable or ill-conditioned, but it is difficult to
solve partial differential equations (PDEs) due to too many optimization
variables. In this study, we propose an Online Dimension Reduction Optimization
(ODRO) method to enhance the convergence of the traditional iterative method to
obtain the steady-state solution of unstable problem. This method performs
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) on the snapshots collected from a few
iteration steps, optimizes PDE residual in the POD subspace to get a solution
with lower residual, and then continues to iterate with the optimized solution
as the initial value, repeating the above three steps until the residual
converges. Several typical cases show that the proposed method can efficiently
calculate the steady-state solution of unstable problem with both the high
efficiency and robustness of the iterative method and the good convergence of
the optimization method. In addition, this method is easy to implement in
almost any iterative solver with minimal code modification.

demonstrated a photon-sensitive receiver prototype with over Gigabit data rate,
immunity to strong background photon noise, and simultaneous tracking ability.
The advantages are inherited from a joint-optimized superconducting nanowire
single-photon detector (SNSPD) array, designed into a four-quadrant structure
with each quadrant capable of resolving six photons. Installed in a free-space
coupled and low-vibration cryostat, the system detection efficiency reached
72.7%, the detector efficiency was 97.5%, and the total photon counting rate
was 1.6 Gcps. Additionally, communication performance was tested for pulse
position modulation (PPM) format. A series of signal processing methods were
introduced to maximize the performance of the forward error correction (FEC)
code. Consequently, the receiver exhibits a faster data rate and better
sensitivity by about twofold (1.76 photons/bit at 800 Mbps and 3.40 photons/bit
at 1.2 Gbps) compared to previously reported results (3.18 photon/bit at 622
Mbps for the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration). Furthermore,
communications in strong background noise and with simultaneous tracking
ability were demonstrated aimed at the challenges of daylight operation and
accurate tracking of dim beacon light in deep space scenarios.

intent and token-level slot label annotations required to train neural network
(NN)-based Natural Language Understanding (NLU) components of task-oriented
dialog systems, especially for the many real world tasks that have a large and
growing number of intents and slot types. While zero shot learning approaches
that require no labeled examples -- only features and auxiliary information --
have been proposed only for slot labeling, we show that one can profitably
perform joint zero-shot intent classification and slot labeling. We demonstrate
the value of capturing dependencies between intents and slots, and between
different slots in an utterance in the zero shot setting. We describe NN
architectures that translate between word and sentence embedding spaces, and
demonstrate that these modifications are required to enable zero shot learning
for this task. We show a substantial improvement over strong baselines and
explain the intuition behind each architectural modification through
visualizations and ablation studies.

  Estimation in mmWave and THz Direction-scan Measurements","13 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text
  overlap with arXiv:2203.16745 by other authors",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To extract channel characteristics and conduct channel modeling in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands, accurate estimations of
multi-path component (MPC) parameters in measured results are fundamental.
However, due to high frequency and narrow antenna beams in mmWave and THz
direction-scan measurements, existing channel parameter estimation algorithms
are no longer effective. In this paper, a novel narrow-beam near-field
space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (N2-SAGE) algorithm is
proposed, which is derived by carefully considering the features of mmWave and
THz direction-scan measurement campaigns, such as near field propagation,
narrow antenna beams as well as asynchronous measurements in different scanning
directions. The delays of MPCs are calculated using spherical wave front (SWF),
which depends on delay and angles of MPCs, resulting in a high-dimensional
estimation problem. To overcome this, a novel two-phase estimation process is
proposed, including a rough estimation phase and an accurate estimation phase.
Moreover, considering the narrow antenna beams used for mmWave and THz
direction-scan measurements, the usage of partial information alleviates
influence of background noises. Additionally, the phases of MPCs in different
scanning directions are treated as random variables, which are estimated and
reused during the estimation process, making the algorithm immune to possible
phase errors. Furthermore, performance of the proposed N2-SAGE algorithm is
validated and compared with existing channel parameter estimation algorithms,
based on simulations and measured data. Results show that the proposed N2-SAGE
algorithm greatly outperforms existing channel parameter estimation algorithms
in terms of estimation accuracy. By using the N2-SAGE algorithm, the channel is
characterized more correctly and reasonably.
