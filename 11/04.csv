  via the Principal Component Analysis and its equivalence with Quasi Maximum
  Likelihood estimation",,,,,"econ.EM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We provide an alternative derivation of the asymptotic results for the
Principal Components estimator of a large approximate factor model and we prove
that the derived estimator of the loadings is asymptotically equivalent to
their Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimator. This result holds regardless of the
specific second order structure of the idiosyncratic components, which can be
both serially and cross-sectionally weakly correlated as well as
heteroskedastic. Results are derived under a minimal set of assumptions and, in
particular, we require only the existence of 4th order moments. A special focus
is given to the time series setting, a case considered in almost all recent
econometric applications of factor models. Hence, estimation is based on the
classical $n\times n$ sample covariance matrix and not on a $T\times T$
covariance matrix often considered in the literature. Indeed, despite the two
approaches being asymptotically equivalent, the former is more coherent with a
time series setting and it immediately allows us to write more intuitive
asymptotic expansions for the Principal Component estimators showing that they
are equivalent to OLS as long as $\sqrt n/T\to 0$ and $\sqrt T/n\to 0$, that is
the loadings are estimated in a time series regression as if the factors were
known, while the factors are estimated in a cross-sectional regression as if
the loadings were known. Finally, we give some alternative sets of primitive
sufficient conditions for mean-squared consistency of the sample covariance
matrix of the factors, of the idiosyncratic components, and of the observed
time series, which is the starting point for Principal Component Analysis.

cycling of baryons within and in and out of galaxies. We use idealized
numerical simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, in which we systemically vary
the galaxy morphology (bulge-to-total mass ratio) and stellar feedback strength
(total eight setups with 80 simulations). By following individual gas parcels
through the disk, spiral arms, and massive star-forming clumps, we quantify how
gas moves and oscillates through the different phases of the interstellar
medium (ISM) and forms stars. We show that the residence time of gas in the
dense ISM phase ($\tau_{\rm SF}$), the nature of spiral arms (strength,
number), and the clump properties (number, mass function, and young star
fraction) depend on both the galaxy morphology and stellar feedback. Based on
these results, we quantify signatures of the baryon cycle within galaxies using
the temporal and spatial power spectrum density (PSD) of the star formation
history (SFH). Stronger stellar feedback leads to more bursty star formation
while the correlation timescale of the SFH is longer, because stronger feedback
dissolves the dense, star-forming ISM phase, leading to a more homogeneous ISM
and a decrease in $\tau_{\rm SF}$. The bulge strength has a similar effect: the
deep gravitational potential in a bulge-dominant galaxy imposes a strong shear
force that effectively breaks apart gas clumps in the ISM; this subsequently
inhibits the fragmentation of cool gas and therefore the star formation in the
disk, leading to a decrease in the spatial power on scales of $\sim$ 1 kpc. We
conclude that measurements of the temporal and spatial PSD of the SFH can
provide constraints on the baryon cycle and the star formation process.

  Using profile likelihoods, which are free from volume effects, we instead
find that the best-fitting parameters are associated with an intermediate
regime where around $3 \%$ of cold dark matter decays just prior to

Authors listed in alphabetical order",,,,"math.PR cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.stat-mech math-ph math.CA math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gibbsian structure in random point fields has been a classical tool for
studying their spatial properties. However, exact Gibbs property is available
only in a relatively limited class of models, and it does not adequately
address many random fields with a strongly dependent spatial structure. In this
work, we provide a general framework for approximate Gibbsian structure for
strongly correlated random point fields. These include processes that exhibit
strong spatial rigidity, in particular, a certain one-parameter family of
analytic Gaussian zero point fields, namely the $\alpha$-GAFs. Our framework
entails conditions that may be verified via finite particle approximations to
the process, a phenomenon that we call an approximate Gibbs property. We show
that these enable one to compare the spatial conditional measures in the
infinite volume limit with Gibbs-type densities supported on appropriate
singular manifolds, a phenomenon we refer to as a generalized Gibbs property.
We demonstrate the scope of our approach by showing that a generalized Gibbs
property holds with a logarithmic pair potential for the $\alpha$-GAFs for any
value of $\alpha$. This establishes the level of rigidity of the $\alpha$-GAF
zero process to be exactly $\lfloor \frac{1}{\alpha} \rfloor$, settling in the
affirmative an open question regarding the existence of point processes with
any specified level of rigidity. For processes such as the zeros of
$\alpha$-GAFs, which involve complex, many-body interactions, our results imply
that the local behaviour of the random points still exhibits 2D Coulomb-type
repulsion in the short range. Our techniques can be leveraged to estimate the
relative energies of configurations under local perturbations, with possible
implications for dynamics and stochastic geometry on strongly correlated random
point fields.

mutual relationship between localization and mapping of the subject in its
surrounding environment. With the help of different sensors, various types of
SLAM systems have developed to deal with the problem of building the
relationship between localization and mapping. A limitation in the SLAM process
is the lack of consideration of dynamic objects in the mapping of the
environment. We propose the Dynamic Object Tracking SLAM (DyOb-SLAM), which is
a Visual SLAM system that can localize and map the surrounding dynamic objects
in the environment as well as track the dynamic objects in each frame. With the
help of a neural network and a dense optical flow algorithm, dynamic objects
and static objects in an environment can be differentiated. DyOb-SLAM creates
two separate maps for both static and dynamic contents. For the static
features, a sparse map is obtained. For the dynamic contents, a trajectory
global map is created as output. As a result, a frame to frame real-time based
dynamic object tracking system is obtained. With the pose calculation of the
dynamic objects and camera, DyOb-SLAM can estimate the speed of the dynamic
objects with time. The performance of DyOb-SLAM is observed by comparing it
with a similar Visual SLAM system, VDO-SLAM and the performance is measured by
calculating the camera and object pose errors as well as the object speed
error.

independent set (MIS) in hypergraphs in the LOCAL model. A maximal matching of
a hypergraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$ is a maximal disjoint set $M\subseteq E_H$ of
hyperedges and an MIS $S\subseteq V_H$ is a maximal set of nodes such that no
hyperedge is fully contained in $S$. Both problems can be solved by a simple
sequential greedy algorithm, which can be implemented naively in $O(\Delta r +
\log^* n)$ rounds, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree, $r$ is the rank, and
$n$ is the number of nodes.
  We show that for maximal matching, this naive algorithm is optimal in the
following sense. Any deterministic algorithm for solving the problem requires
$\Omega(\min\{\Delta r, \log_{\Delta r} n\})$ rounds, and any randomized one
requires $\Omega(\min\{\Delta r, \log_{\Delta r} \log n\})$ rounds. Hence, for
any algorithm with a complexity of the form $O(f(\Delta, r) + g(n))$, we have
$f(\Delta, r) \in \Omega(\Delta r)$ if $g(n)$ is not too large, and in
particular if $g(n) = \log^* n$ (which is the optimal asymptotic dependency on
$n$ due to Linial's lower bound [FOCS'87]). Our lower bound proof is based on
the round elimination framework, and its structure is inspired by a new round
elimination fixed point that we give for the $\Delta$-vertex coloring problem
in hypergraphs.
  For the MIS problem on hypergraphs, we show that for $\Delta\ll r$, there are
significant improvements over the naive $O(\Delta r + \log^* n)$-round
algorithm. We give two deterministic algorithms for the problem. We show that a
hypergraph MIS can be computed in $O(\Delta^2\cdot\log r + \Delta\cdot\log
r\cdot \log^* r + \log^* n)$ rounds. We further show that at the cost of a
worse dependency on $\Delta$, the dependency on $r$ can be removed almost
entirely, by giving an algorithm with complexity $\Delta^{O(\Delta)}\cdot\log^*

it is assumed that the illumination is uniform in the scene. However, real

through gravitational wave observations. However, the precise evolution of the
condensate must be known for the actual detection. For future observation, we
numerically study the influence of the self-interaction, especially interaction
between different modes, on the evolution of the condensate in detail. First,
we focus on the case when condensate starts with the smallest possible angular
quantum number. For this case, we perform the non-linear calculation and show
that the dissipation induced by the mode interaction is strong enough to
saturate the superradiant instability, even if the secondary cloud starts with
quantum fluctuations. Our result indicates that explosive phenomena such as
bosenova do not occur in this case. We also show that the condensate settles to
a quasi-stationary state mainly composed of two modes, one with the smallest
angular quantum number for which the superradiant instability occurs and the
other with the adjacent higher angular quantum number. We also study the case
when the condensate starts with the dominance of the higher angular quantum
number. We show that the dissipation process induced by the mode coupling does
not occur for small gravitational coupling. Therefore, bosenova might occur in
this case.

apparent triumph of liberal democracies at the end of the twentieth century,
Francis Fukuyama and others have been arguing that humankind is approaching an
`end of history' (EoH) in the form of a universality of liberal democracies.
This view has been challenged by recent developments that seem to indicate the
rise of defective democracies across the globe. There has been no attempt to
quantify the expected EoH with a statistical approach. In this study, we model
the transition between political regimes as a Markov process and -- using a
Bayesian inference approach -- we estimate the transition probabilities between
political regimes from time-series data describing the evolution of political
regimes from 1800--2018. We then compute the steady state for this Markov
process which represents a mathematical abstraction of the EoH and predicts
that approximately 46 % of countries will be full democracies. Furthermore, we
find that, under our model, the fraction of autocracies in the world is
expected to increase for the next half-century before it declines. Using
random-walk theory, we then estimate survival curves of different types of
regimes and estimate characteristic lifetimes of democracies and autocracies of
244 years and 69 years, respectively. Quantifying the expected EoH allows us to
challenge common beliefs about the nature of political equilibria.
Specifically, we find no statistical evidence that the EoH constitutes a fixed,
complete omnipresence of democratic regimes.

Divide and Conquer mitigation control (MSCIDC) approach is proposed for faster
detection and mitigation of forest fire by reducing the loss of biodiversity,
nutrients, soil moisture, and other intangible benefits. A swarm is a
cooperative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that fly together to
search and quench the fire effectively. The multi-swarm cooperative
information-driven search uses a multi-level search comprising cooperative
information-driven exploration and exploitation for quick/accurate detection of
fire location. The search level is selected based on the thermal sensor
information about the potential fire area. The dynamicity of swarms, aided by
global regulative repulsion and merging between swarms, reduces the detection
and mitigation time compared to the existing methods. The local attraction
among the members of the swarm helps the non-detector members to reach the fire
location faster, and divide-and-conquer mitigation control ensures a
non-overlapping fire sector allocation for all members quenching the fire. The
performance of MSCIDC has been compared with different multi-UAV methods using
a simulated environment of pine forest. The performance clearly shows that
MSCIDC mitigates fire much faster than the multi-UAV methods. The Monte-Carlo
simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces the average forest
area burnt by $65\%$ and mission time by $60\%$ compared to the best result
case of the multi-UAV approaches, guaranteeing a faster and successful mission.

the difference in nucleon distribution in the isobar nuclei. We investigate the
$J/\psi$ production in the isobar collision via a relativistic transport
approach. By comparing the isobar systems according to equal centrality bin and
equal multiplicity bin, we find that the yield ratio of $J/\psi$ is sensitive
to the differences in both the number of binary collisions and the medium
evolution. Besides, the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $J/\psi$ is qualitatively
different from the light hadrons, and the ratio between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr
collisions is sensitive to the medium evolution. The charmonium production
provides an independent probe to study the nucleon distribution in the isobar
system.

patent embedding could be used to associate a pair of patents, we observe using
a recall task that multiple initial patents could be associated with a target

shear thickening, we report ordering fluctuations with high temporal
resolution, and directly measure a decrease in order with distance from the
suspension's bottom boundary as well as a direct correlation between order and
particle concentration. Higher applied stress produces shear thickening with
large fluctuations in boundary stress which we find are accompanied by dramatic
fluctuations in suspension flow speeds. The peak flow rates are independent of
distance from the suspension boundary, indicating that they likely arise from
transient jamming that creates solid-like aggregates of particles moving
together, but only briefly because the high speed fluctuations are interspersed
with regions flowing much more slowly, suggesting that shear thickening
suspensions possess complex internal structural dynamics, even in relatively

nondestructive testing and quantitative characterization of structures. These
applications rely on the correct prediction of the ZGV points. In this
contribution, we first model the ZGV resonances in anisotropic plates based on
the appearance of an additional modal solution. The resulting governing
equation is interpreted as a two-parameter eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, we
present three complementary numerical procedures capable of computing ZGV
points in arbitrary nondissipative elastic waveguides in the conventional sense
that their axial power flux vanishes. The first method is globally convergent
and guarantees to find all ZGV points but can only be used for small problems.
The second procedure is a very fast, generally-applicable, Newton-type
iteration that is locally convergent and requires initial guesses. The third
method combines both kinds of approaches and yields a procedure that is
applicable to large problems, does not require initial guesses and is likely to

are only able to extract central moments of uncertainty thereby limiting the
quality of their uncertainty estimates. We present a simple framework for
high-resolution predictive uncertainty quantification of semantic segmentation
models that leverages a multi-moment functional definition of uncertainty
associated with the model's feature space in the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS). The multiple uncertainty functionals extracted from this
framework are defined by the local density dynamics of the model's feature
space and hence automatically align themselves at the tail-regions of the
intrinsic probability density function of the feature space (where uncertainty
is the highest) in such a way that the successively higher order moments
quantify the more uncertain regions. This leads to a significantly more
accurate view of model uncertainty than conventional Bayesian methods.
Moreover, the extraction of such moments is done in a single-shot computation
making it much faster than Bayesian and ensemble approaches (that involve a
high number of forward stochastic passes of the model to quantify its
uncertainty). We demonstrate these advantages through experimental evaluations
of our framework implemented over four different state-of-the-art model
architectures that are trained and evaluated on two benchmark road-scene
segmentation datasets (Camvid and Cityscapes).

effectively bridge the gap between the salient point and the query-based

identified eleven such inverse scaling tasks, evaluated on models of up to 280B

closer look at these inverse scaling tasks. We evaluate models of up to 540B

Inverse Scaling Prize. With this increased range of model sizes and training
compute, only four out of the eleven tasks remain inverse scaling. Six out of
the eleven tasks exhibit ""U-shaped scaling"", where performance decreases up to
a certain size, and then increases again up to the largest model evaluated (the
one remaining task displays positive scaling). In addition, we find that 1-shot
examples and chain-of-thought can help mitigate undesirable scaling patterns
even further. U-shaped scaling suggests that the inverse scaling trend observed

propose the first model selection algorithm for offline RL that achieves
minimax rate-optimal oracle inequalities up to logarithmic factors. The
algorithm, ModBE, takes as input a collection of candidate model classes and a

scaling with the complexity of the minimally complete model class. In addition
to its theoretical guarantees, it is conceptually simple and computationally

dissipation law is unconditionally preserved at discrete levels. Under a mild
ratio restriction, i.e., \Ass{1}: $0<r_k:=\tau_k/\tau_{k-1}< r_{\max}\approx
4.8645$, we establish a rigorous error estimate in $H^1$-norm and achieve
optimal second-order accuracy in time. The proof involves the tools of discrete
orthogonal convolution (DOC) kernels and inequality zoom. It is worth noting
that the presented adaptive time-step scheme only requires solving one linear
system with constant coefficients at each time step. In our analysis, the
first-consistent BDF1 for the first step does not bring the order reduction in
$H^1$-norm. The $H^1$ bound of the numerical solution under periodic boundary
conditions can be derived without any restriction (such as zero mean of the
initial data). Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify our
theoretical analysis and the algorithm efficiency.

  and glassy dynamics",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The physics of how molecules, organelles, and foreign objects move within
living cells has been extensively studied in organisms ranging from bacteria to
human cells. In mammalian cells, in particular, cellular vesicles move across
the cell using motor proteins that carry the vesicle down the cytoskeleton to
their destination. We have recently noted several similarities between the
motion of such vesicles and that in disordered, ""glassy"", systems, but it
remains unclear whether that is a general observation or something specific to
certain vesicles in one particular cell type. Here we follow the motion of
mitochondria, the organelles responsible for cell energy production, in several
mammalian cell types over timescales ranging from 50 ms up to 70 s. Qualitative
observations show that single mitochondria remain stalled, remaining within a
spatially limited region, for extended periods of time, before moving longer
distances relatively quickly. Analysing this motion quantitatively, we observe
a displacement distribution that is roughly Gaussian for shorter distances
($\lesssim$ 0.05 $\mu$m) but which exhibits exponentially decaying tails at
longer distances (up to 0.40 $\mu$m). We show that this behaviour is
well-described by a model originally developed to describe the motion in glassy
systems. These observations are extended to in total 3 different objects
(mitochondria, lysosomes and nano-sized beads enclosed in vesicles), 3
different mammalian cell types, from 2 different organisms (human and mouse).
We provide further evidence that supports glass-like characteristics of the
motion by showing a difference between the time it takes to move a longer
distance for the first time and subsequent times, as well as a weak ergodicity
breaking of the motion. Overall, we demonstrate the ubiquity of glass-like
motion in mammalian cells, providing a different perspective on intracellular
motion.

employing bosonization analysis and the high-precision time-dependent

300 sites. From state-of-the-art TDVP calculations, we find that the spectral
weights of the holon-folding and $3k_F$ branches evolve oppositely as a
function of $V$. This peculiar dichotomy may be explained in bosonization
analysis from the opposite dependence of exponent that determines the spectral
weights on Luttinger parameter $K_{\rho}$. Moreover, our TDVP calculations of
models with fixed $U=8t$ and different $V$ show that $V\approx -1.7t$ may fit
the experimental results best, indicating a moderate effective NN attraction in
1D cuprates that might provide some hints towards understanding
superconductivity in 2D cuprates.

investigate the potential clinical effects of online APT for HN cancer patients
in relative to the current offline APT via simulations. To mimic an online APT
treatment course, we have recalculated and evaluated the actual dose of the
current treatment plan on patient actual treatment anatomy captured by cone
beam CT for each fraction. The cumulative dose of simulated online APT courses
was compared to actual offline APT courses and the initially designed treatment
plan dose. For patients 1 and 2, the simulated online ART course maintained a
relatively higher CTV dose coverages than the offline ART course, particularly
for CTV-Low, which led to an improvement of 2.66% and 4.52% in TCP of CTV-Low.
For patients 3 and 4, with clinically comparable CTV dose coverages, the
simulated online ART course achieved better OAR sparing than the offline ART
course. The mean doses of right parotid and oral cavity were decreased from
29.52 Gy relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and 41.89 Gy RBE to 22.16 Gy
RBE and 34.61 Gy RBE for patient 3, leading to a reduce of 1.67% and 3.40% in

double WDs, 2 non-eclipsing double WDs, 1 WD-brown dwarf), we estimate the CE
energy efficiency $\alpha_{\rm{CE}}$ needed to unbind the hydrogen envelope. We
use grids of He- and CO-core WD models to determine the masses and cooling ages
that match each primary WD's radius and temperature. Assuming gravitational
wave-driven orbital decay, we then calculate the associated ranges in post-CE
orbital period. By mapping WD models to a grid of red giant progenitor stars,
we determine the total envelope binding energies and possible orbital periods

Assuming He-core WDs with progenitors of 0.9 - 2.0 $M_\odot$, we find
$\alpha_{\rm CE} \! \sim \! 0.2-0.4$ is consistent with each system we model.
Significantly higher values of $\alpha_{\rm{CE}}$ are required for higher mass
progenitors and for CO-core WDs, so these scenarios are deemed unlikely. Our

and then test whether the regression coefficient for $X$ is non-zero. However,
when the model is misspecified, the test may have poor power, for example when
$X$ is involved in complex interactions, or lead to many false rejections. In
this work we study the problem of testing the model-free null of conditional
mean independence, i.e. that the conditional mean of $Y$ given $X$ and $Z$ does
not depend on $X$. We propose a simple and general framework that can leverage
flexible nonparametric or machine learning methods, such as additive models or
random forests, to yield both robust error control and high power. The
procedure involves using these methods to perform regressions, first to
estimate a form of projection of $Y$ on $X$ and $Z$ using one half of the data,
and then to estimate the expected conditional covariance between this
projection and $Y$ on the remaining half of the data. While the approach is
general, we show that a version of our procedure using spline regression
achieves what we show is the minimax optimal rate in this nonparametric testing
problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
both in terms of maintaining Type I error control, and power, compared to
several existing approaches.

{\sc Python} pipeline to deal with the large data efficiently with the present
computational resources. Our pipeline divides such large H{\sc i}~21-cm
spectral cubes into several small cubelets, and then processes them in parallel
using publicly available H{\sc i}~source finder {\sc SoFiA-$2$}. The pipeline
also takes care of sources at the boundaries of the cubelets and also filters
out false and redundant detections. By comapring with the true source catalog,
we find that the detection efficiency depends on the {\sc SoFiA-$2$} parameters
such as the smoothing kernel size, linking length and threshold values. We find
the optimal kernel size for all flux bins to be between $3$ to $5$ pixels and
$7$ to $15$ pixels, respectively in the spatial and frequency directions.
Comparing the recovered source parameters with the original values, we find
that the output of {\sc SoFiA-$2$} is highly dependent on kernel sizes and a
single choice of kernel is not sufficient for all types of H{\sc i}~galaxies.
We also propose use of alternative methods to {\sc SoFiA-$2$} which can be used

  oscillator coupled to a dissipative bath",,,"10.1063/5.0138250",,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matsubara dynamics is the classical dynamics which results when
imaginary-time path-integrals are smoothed; it conserves the quantum Boltzmann
distribution and appears in drastically approximated form in path-integral
dynamics methods such as (thermostatted) ring-polymer molecular dynamics
(T)RPMD and centroid molecular dynamics (CMD). However, it has never been
compared directly with exact quantum dynamics for non-linear operators, because
the difficulty of treating the phase has limited the number of Matsubara modes
to fewer than 10. Here, we treat up to $\sim$200 Matsubara modes in simulations
of a Morse oscillator coupled to a dissipative bath of harmonic oscillators.
This is done by expressing the Matsubara equations of motion in the form of a
generalised Langevin equation, approximating the noise to be real, and
analytically continuing the momenta to convert the Matsubara phase into
ring-polymer springs. The resulting equations of motion are stable up to a
maximum value of modes which increases with bath coupling strength and
decreases with system anharmonicity. The dynamics of the tail of highly
oscillatory Matsubara modes is found to be harmonic, and can thus be computed
efficiently. For a moderately anharmonic oscillator with a strong but
subcritical coupling to the bath, the Matsubara simulations yield non-linear
$\large\langle{\hat q^2\hat q^2(t)}\large\rangle$ time-correlation functions in
almost perfect agreement with the exact quantum results. Reasonable agreement
is also obtained for weaker coupling strengths, where errors arise because of
the real-noise approximation. These results give strong evidence that Matsubara
dynamics correctly explains how classical dynamics arises in quantum systems
which are in thermal equilibrium.

pretraining-then-finetuning paradigm for transfer learning. However, with
frozen models there are relatively few parameters available for adapting to
downstream tasks, which is problematic in computer vision where tasks vary
significantly in input/output format and the type of information that is of
value. In this paper, we present a study of frozen pretrained models when
applied to diverse and representative computer vision tasks, including object
detection, semantic segmentation and video action recognition. From this
empirical analysis, our work answers the questions of what pretraining task
fits best with this frozen setting, how to make the frozen setting more
flexible to various downstream tasks, and the effect of larger model sizes. We
additionally examine the upper bound of performance using a giant frozen

competitive performance on a varied set of major benchmarks with only one

Our algorithm is based on generating a Gaussian Process surrogate model of the
log-posterior, aided by a Support Vector Machine classifier that excludes
extreme or non-finite values. An active learning scheme allows us to reduce the
number of required posterior evaluations by two orders of magnitude compared to
traditional Monte Carlo inference. Our algorithm allows for parallel
evaluations of the posterior at optimal locations, further reducing wall-clock
times. We significantly improve performance using properties of the posterior
in our active learning scheme and for the definition of the GP prior. In
particular we account for the expected dynamical range of the posterior in
different dimensionalities. We test our model against a number of synthetic and
cosmological examples. GPry outperforms traditional Monte Carlo methods when
the evaluation time of the likelihood (or the calculation of theoretical
observables) is of the order of seconds; for evaluation times of over a minute
it can perform inference in days that would take months using traditional

monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates). The US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) initiated Project Optimus to reform the dose optimization

attention to benefit-risk consideration.
  We systematically investigated the operating characteristics of the seamless
phase 2-3 design as a strategy for dose optimization, where in stage 1
(corresponding to phase 2) patients are randomized to multiple doses, with or
without a control; and in stage 2 (corresponding to phase 3) the efficacy of
the selected optimal dose is evaluated with a randomized concurrent control or
historical control. Depending on whether the concurrent control is included and
the type of endpoints used in stages 1 and 2, we describe four types of
seamless phase 2-3 dose-optimization designs, which are suitable for different
clinical settings. The statistical and design considerations that pertain to
dose optimization are discussed. Simulation shows that dose optimization phase
2-3 designs are able to control the familywise type I error rates and yield
appropriate statistical power with substantially smaller sample size than the
conventional approach. The sample size savings range from 16.6% to 27.3%,
depending on the design and scenario, with a mean savings of 22.1%. Due to the
interim dose selection, the phase 2-3 dose-optimization design is logistically

methods in spherical symmetry that resolve the gravitational evolution to much
higher accuracy than Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT), which is the current
gold standard in the literature. One of the methods selects a stable
fixed-point solution of the renormalization-group flow equation, thereby
predicting already at the leading order the critical exponent of the phase

LPT series far into the UV regime, by adding a non-analytic term that captures
the critical nature of the gravitational collapse. We find that the UV method
most accurately resolves the evolution of the nonlinear density as well as its

achieved with the renormalization-group method, especially when paired with

indicator of burstiness in star-formation) as a function of galactocentric
radius. We find that galaxies below stellar mass of $\sim$10$^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$,
at all radii, have a \uvha\ ratio higher than the equilibrium value expected
from constant star-formation, indicating a significant contribution from bursty
star-formation. Even for galaxies with stellar mass $\gtrsim$10$^{9.5}$

the outskirts of even the most massive galaxies but is likely over-shadowed by
their brighter cores. Furthermore, we present the \uvha\ ratio as a function of

that regions below $\sim$10$^{7.5}$ M$_\odot$ kpc$^{-2}$ are consistent with
bursty star-formation, regardless of their galaxy stellar mass, potentially
suggesting that local star-formation is independent of global galaxy properties

the determined fermion mass hierarchy and quark mixing matrix elements in the
Standard Model (SM). Here we extend it by coupling the FN field, the flavon, to
a dark sector containing one or more dark matter particles which are produced
non-thermally sequentially through flavon production. Non-thermal flavon
production occurs efficiently via freeze-in and through field oscillations. We
explore this in the regime of high-scale breaking $\Lambda$ of the global
$U(1)_{\textrm{FN}}$ group and at the reheating temperature $T_R\ll \Lambda$
where the flavon remains out of equilibrium at all times. We identify
phenomenologically acceptable regions of $T_R$ and the flavon mass where the
relic abundance of dark matter and other cosmological constraints are
satisfied. In the case of one-component dark matter we find an effective upper
limit on the FN charges at high $\Lambda$, i.e. $Q_{\rm FN}^{\rm DM}\leq13$. In
the multi-component dark sector scenario the dark matter can be the heaviest
dark particle that can be effectively stable at cosmological timescales,
alternatively it can be produced sequentially by decays of the heavier ones.
For scenarios where dark decays occur at intermediate timescales, i.e. $t\sim
0.1- 10^{28}\,{\rm s}$, we find that existing searches can effectively probe
interesting regions of parameter space. These searches include indirect probes
on decays such as $\gamma$-ray and neutrino telescopes as well as analyses of
the Cosmic Microwave Background, as well as constraints on small scale
structure formation from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We comment on the future
prospects of such probes, place projected sensitivities, and discuss how this

ML4EFT, enabling the integration of unbinned multivariate observables into

enhance the sensitivity to the theory parameters by preventing the information
loss incurred when binning in a subset of final-state kinematic variables. Our
strategy combines machine learning regression and classification techniques to
parameterize high-dimensional likelihood ratios, using the Monte Carlo replica
method to estimate and propagate methodological uncertainties. As a proof of
concept we construct unbinned multivariate observables for top-quark pair and
Higgs+$Z$ production at the LHC, demonstrate their impact on the SMEFT
parameter space as compared to binned measurements, and study the improved
constraints associated to multivariate inputs. Since the number of neural
networks to be trained scales quadratically with the number of parameters and
can be fully parallelized, the ML4EFT framework is well-suited to construct
unbinned multivariate observables which depend on up to tens of EFT
coefficients, as required in global fits.

detection represents the first very high energy $\gamma$-rays observed from a

MAGIC described the observed $\gamma$-rays as arising from a single, external
shock. In this paper, we perform detailed, multi-zone modeling of RS Ophiuchi's
2021 outburst including a self-consistent prescription for particle
acceleration and magnetic field amplification. We demonstrate that, contrary to
previous work, a single shock cannot simultaneously explain RS Ophiuchi's GeV
and TeV emission, particularly the spectral shape and distinct light curve
peaks. Instead, we put forward a model involving multiple shocks that
reproduces the observed $\gamma$-ray spectrum and temporal evolution. The
simultaneous appearance of multiple distinct velocity components in the nova
optical spectrum over the first several days of the outburst supports the
presence of distinct shocks, which may arise either from the strong latitudinal
dependence of the density of the external circumbinary medium (e.g., in the
binary equatorial plane versus the poles) or due to internal collisions within

medium of the Milky Way displays a relatively high degree of patchiness on
angular scales of $\sim10^\circ$. Taking advantage of the Spectrum Roentgen
Gamma eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS), we aim to constrain any
variation in the soft X-ray surface brightness on scales going from sub-degree
to a hundred square degrees. We observe modulations of about $60$% on scales of
several degrees and decreasing for higher energies. The observed patchiness is
stable over a period of two years, therefore excluding that it is induced by
Solar wind charge exchange. We also observe no correlation between such excess
and the density of galaxies in the Local Universe, suggesting no strong
contribution from the hot baryons in the filaments of the Cosmic web. Instead,
the soft X-ray emission is anti-correlated with the column density of absorbing
material. Indeed, we can reproduce the spectrum of the bright and dark regions
by simply varying the column density of the matter absorbing the emission
components located beyond the Local Hot Bubble, while no modulation of the
intrinsic emission is required. At high Galactic latitudes, the eROSITA all sky
map shows patchiness of the soft X-ray diffuse emission similar to the one
observed in the eFEDS field, it is therefore likely that the same
""absorption-modulation"" is present over the entire sky. These results highlight
the importance of an accurate treatment of the absorption effects, to determine
the patchiness of the circumgalactic medium.

linearizing any nonlinearity in curvature, torsion or non-metricity by
introducing suitable Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, we use a split formalism
for differential forms, writing them in $(n-1)+1$ dimensions. The boundary
terms of the action are manifest in this formalism by means of Stokes' theorem,
such that the compensating GHY term for the Dirichlet problem may be read off

non-metricity do not require any GHY term compensation for the variational

for Einstein-Hilbert and four-dimensional Chern-Simons modified gravity.
Moreover, we obtain new results for Lovelock-Chern-Simons and metric-affine

  Harmonization","Accepted at NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Self-supervised pre-training recently demonstrates success on large-scale
multimodal data, and state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods often
enforce the feature consistency from cross-modality inputs, such as video/audio
or video/text pairs. Despite its convenience to formulate and leverage in
practice, such cross-modality alignment (CMA) is only a weak and noisy
supervision, since two modalities can be semantically misaligned even they are
temporally aligned. For example, even in the commonly adopted instructional
videos, a speaker can sometimes refer to something that is not visually present
in the current frame; and the semantic misalignment would only be more
unpredictable for the raw videos from the internet. We conjecture that might
cause conflicts and biases among modalities, and may hence prohibit CMA from
scaling up to training with larger and more heterogeneous data. This paper
first verifies our conjecture by observing that, even in the latest VATT
pre-training using only instructional videos, there exist strong gradient
conflicts between different CMA losses within the same video, audio, text
triplet, indicating them as the noisy source of supervision. We then propose to
harmonize such gradients, via two techniques: (i) cross-modality gradient
realignment: modifying different CMA loss gradients for each sample triplet, so
that their gradient directions are more aligned; and (ii) gradient-based
curriculum learning: leveraging the gradient conflict information on an
indicator of sample noisiness, to develop a curriculum learning strategy to
prioritize training on less noisy sample triplets. Applying those techniques to
pre-training VATT on the HowTo100M dataset, we consistently improve its
performance on different downstream tasks. Moreover, we are able to scale VATT
pre-training to more complicated non-narrative Youtube8M dataset to further
improve the state-of-the-arts.

discrete equation which is consistent around the cube. In a recent work, it was
conjectured that this equation is Darboux integrable (i.e., for each of two
independent discrete variables there exist non-trivial functions that remain
unchanged on solutions of the equation after the shift in this discrete
variable). We demonstrate that this conjecture is not true for generic values
of the equation coefficients.
  To do this, we employ two-point invertible transformations introduced by
R.I.~Yamilov. We prove that an autonomous difference equation on the quad-graph
cannot be Darboux integrable if a transformation of the above type maps
solutions of this equation into its solutions again. This implies that the
generic Hietarinta equation is not Darboux integrable since the Hietarinta
equation in the general case possesses the two-point invertible
auto-transformations. Along the way, all Darboux integrable subcases of the
Hietarinta equation are found. All of them are reduced by point transformations
to already known integrable equations.
  At the end of the article, we also briefly describe another way to prove the
Darboux non-integrability of the Hietarinta equation. This alternative way is
based on the known fact that a difference substitution relates this equation to
a linear one. Thus, the Hietarinta equation gives us an example of a quad-graph
equation that is linearizable but not Darboux integrable.

reconfigurable circuits with low error rates are expected to have superior
quantum volumes. Cryogenic CMOS plays a crucial role in the realization of
scalable quantum computers, by minimizing the feature size, lowering the cost,
power consumption, and implementing low latency error correction. Our approach
toward achieving scalable feed-back based control systems includes the design
of memory based arbitrary waveform generators (AWG's), wide band radio
frequency analog to digital converters, integrated amplifier chain, and state
discriminators that can be synchronized with gate sequences. Digitally assisted
designs, when implemented in an advanced CMOS node such as 7 nm can reap the
benefits of low power due to scaling. A qubit readout chain demands several
amplification stages before the digitizer. We propose the co-integration of our
in-house developed InP HEMT LNAs with CMOS LNA stages to achieve the required
gain at the digitizer input with minimal area. Our approach using high
impedance matching between the HEMT LNA and the cryogenic CMOS receiver can
relax the design constraints of an inverter-based CMOS LNA, paving the way
toward a fully integrated qubit readout chain. The qubit state discriminator
consists of a digital signal processor that computes the qubit state from the
digitizer output and a pre-determined threshold. The proposed system realizes
feedback-based optimal control for error mitigation and reduction of the
required data rate through the serial interface to room temperature

benefited from rich distributed data while protecting data privacy.
Nonetheless, the heterogeneity nature of distributed data makes it challenging
to define and ensure fairness among local agents. For instance, it is
intuitively ""unfair"" for agents with data of high quality to sacrifice their
performance due to other agents with low quality data. Currently popular
egalitarian and weighted equity-based fairness measures suffer from the
aforementioned pitfall. In this work, we aim to formally represent this problem
and address these fairness issues using concepts from co-operative game theory
and social choice theory. We model the task of learning a shared predictor in
the federated setting as a fair public decision making problem, and then define
the notion of core-stable fairness: Given $N$ agents, there is no subset of
agents $S$ that can benefit significantly by forming a coalition among
themselves based on their utilities $U_N$ and $U_S$ (i.e., $\frac{|S|}{N} U_S
\geq U_N$). Core-stable predictors are robust to low quality local data from
some agents, and additionally they satisfy Proportionality and
Pareto-optimality, two well sought-after fairness and efficiency notions within
social choice. We then propose an efficient federated learning protocol CoreFed
to optimize a core stable predictor. CoreFed determines a core-stable predictor
when the loss functions of the agents are convex. CoreFed also determines
approximate core-stable predictors when the loss functions are not convex, like
smooth neural networks. We further show the existence of core-stable predictors
in more general settings using Kakutani's fixed point theorem. Finally, we
empirically validate our analysis on two real-world datasets, and we show that
CoreFed achieves higher core-stability fairness than FedAvg while having
similar accuracy.

optimal linear source predictor can perform arbitrarily worse on the target
domain than always predicting the mean; (iii) the optimal target predictor can
be identified, even when the missingness rates themselves are not; and (iv) for

with stellar masses smaller than $10^{8}$M$_{\odot}$ do not follow the
extrapolation of the fundamental plane. This result suggests that mechanisms
other than the balance between inflows and outflows may be at play in
regulating the position of low mass galaxies in the M-Z-SFR space.

without interacting with the environment. Prior methods learn a 1-step dynamics
model, which predicts the next state given the current state and action. These
models do not immediately tell the agent which actions to take, but must be
integrated into a larger RL framework. Can we model the environment dynamics in
a different way, such that the learned model does directly indicate the value
of each action? In this paper, we propose Contrastive Value Learning (CVL),
which learns an implicit, multi-step model of the environment dynamics. This
model can be learned without access to reward functions, but nonetheless can be
used to directly estimate the value of each action, without requiring any TD
learning. Because this model represents the multi-step transitions implicitly,
it avoids having to predict high-dimensional observations and thus scales to
high-dimensional tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that CVL outperforms prior

uncertainty, is of fundamental importance to neutron scattering measurements.
Especially in cases where instruments are highly configurable, the
determination of the absolute wavelength after any change must always be
performed. Inspired by the manner with which neutron spectrometers determine
the absolute wavelength, we evaluate for the first time, in the author's
knowledge, a commonly used method for converting TOF to neutron wavelength, the
distance of a monitor from the source of neutrons and we analytically calculate
the uncertainty contributions that limit the precision of the conversion. The
method was evaluated at the V20 test beamline at the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin
(HZB), emulating the ESS source with a pulse of 2.86 ms length and 14 Hz
repetition rate, by using a mini-chopper operated at 140 Hz, beam monitors
(BMs) and data acquisition infrastructure. The mini-chopper created
well-defined neutron pulses and the BM was placed at two positions, enabling
the average wavelength of each of the pulses created to be determined. The used
experimental setup resulted in absolute wavelength determination at the monitor
positions with a $\delta \lambda_{mean} / \lambda_{mean}$ of $\sim$1.8% for
$\lambda >4$ \r{A}. With a modest increase of the distance between the
reference monitor positions a $\delta \lambda_{mean} / \lambda_{mean}$ of below
0.5% can be achieved. Further improvements are possible by using a thinner
monitor, smaller chopper disc openings and a higher rotational speed chopper.
The method requires only two neutron measurements and doesn't necessitate the
use of crystals or complex fitting, and could constitute a suitable addition to
imaging, diffraction, reflectometers and small angle neutron scattering
instruments, at spallation sources, that do not normally utilise fast choppers.

more communication efficient than Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with optimized,

the bottleneck of costly communication and limited local computation, by
eliminating a potentially wasteful tuning process, and by optimizing the

applying the VPA to an intractable optimization problem with $n$ objects, the
exponential-time dependence in enumeration of the feasible solution set is
attributed solely to the variable parameter $\nu$, $\nu<<n$. As opposed to the
FPA, the VPA does not imply any restriction on some problem parameters, it
rather takes an advantage of a favorable nature of the problem, which permits
to reduce the cost of enumeration of the solution space. Our main technical
contribution is a variable parameter algorithm for a strongly
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard single-machine scheduling problem to minimize maximum job
lateness. The target variable parameter $\nu$ is the number of jobs with some
specific characteristics, the ``emerging'' ones. The solution process is
separated in two phases. At phase 1 a partial solution including $n-\nu$
non-emerging jobs is constructed in a low degree polynomial time. At phase 2
less than $\nu!$ permutations of the $\nu$ emerging jobs are considered. Each
of them are incorporated into the partial schedule of phase 1. Doe to the
results of an earlier conducted experimental study, $\nu/n$ varied from $1/4$

  This thesis characterizes nested complexes of simplicial complexes, which we

truncating simple polyhedra, and in more specificity define P-graph
associahedra, which are realized by repeated truncation of faces of simple

  We then define hypercube-graph associahedra as a special case.
Hypercube-graph associahedra are defined by tubes and tubings on a graph with a
matching of dashed edges, with tubes and tubings avoiding those dashed edges.
These simple rules make hypercube-graph tubings a simple and intuitive
extension of classical graph tubings. We explore properties of $\Delta$-nested
complexes and P-nestohedra, and use these results to explore properties of
hypercube-graph associahedra, including their facets and faces, as well as
their normal fans and Minkowski sum decompositions. We use these properties to

abstract images? Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning
have led to the rise of reverse image search engines. Where conventional search
engines accept a text query and return a set of document results, including
images, a reverse image search accepts an image as a query and returns a set of
images as results. This paper evaluates how well common reverse image search
engines discover abstract images. We conducted an experiment leveraging images
from Wikimedia Commons, a website known to be well indexed by Baidu, Bing,
Google, and Yandex. We measure how difficult an image is to find again
(retrievability), what percentage of images returned are relevant (precision),
and the average number of results a visitor must review before finding the
submitted image (mean reciprocal rank). When trying to discover the same image
again among similar images, Yandex performs best. When searching for pages
containing a specific image, Google and Yandex outperform the others when
discovering photographs with precision scores ranging from 0.8191 to 0.8297,
respectively. In both of these cases, Google and Yandex perform better with
natural images than with abstract ones achieving a difference in retrievability
as high as 54\% between images in these categories. These results affect anyone
applying common web search engines to search for technical documents that use
abstract images.

exhibit high storage threshold error rates and improved subthreshold
performance under biased Pauli noise. Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes
can allow for several advantages including a transversal implementation of
non-Clifford logical gates, single-shot decoding strategies, parallelized
decoding in the case of fracton codes as well as construction of fractal
lattice codes. Motivated by this, we tailor 3D topological codes for enhanced
storage performance under biased Pauli noise. We present Clifford deformations
of various 3D topological codes, such that they exhibit a threshold error rate
of $50\%$ under infinitely biased Pauli noise. Our examples include the 3D
surface code on the cubic lattice, the 3D surface code on a checkerboard
lattice that lends itself to a subsystem code with a single-shot decoder, the
3D color code, as well as fracton models such as the X-cube model, the
Sierpinski model and the Haah code. We use the belief propagation with ordered
statistics decoder (BP-OSD) to study threshold error rates at finite bias. We
also present a rotated layout for the 3D surface code, which uses roughly half
the number of physical qubits for the same code distance under appropriate
boundary conditions. Imposing coprime periodic dimensions on this rotated
layout leads to logical operators of weight $O(n)$ at infinite bias and a
corresponding $\exp[-O(n)]$ subthreshold scaling of the logical failure rate,
where $n$ is the number of physical qubits in the code. Even though this
scaling is unstable due to the existence of logical representations with $O(1)$
low-rate Pauli errors, the number of such representations scales only
polynomially for the Clifford-deformed code, leading to an enhanced effective
distance.

functions in various regimes in order to identify the signatures of plasticity
in electronic crystal phases. In particular, we show that proliferation of
dislocations de-pins the spatially resolved conductivity until the crystal
melts, after which point a new phase of a pinned electronic liquid emerges. In
addition, the mode spectrum exhibits a competition between pinning and
plasticity effects, with the damping rate of some modes being controlled by
pinning-induced phase relaxation and some by plasticity-induced strain
relaxation. We find that the recently discovered damping-attenuation relation
continues to hold for pinned-induced phase relaxation even in the presence of
plasticity and dislocations. We also comment on various experimental setups
that could probe the effects of plasticity. The framework developed here is
applicable to a large class of physical systems including electronic Wigner

criteria, such as CTC, a synchronized response from the audio and visual
encoders is critical for a joint AV decision making process. In this work, we
propose a novel alignment regularization technique that promotes
synchronization of the audio and visual encoder, which in turn results in
better word error rates (WERs) at all SNR levels for streaming and offline
AV-ASR models. The proposed AV-ASR model achieves WERs of 2.0% and 2.6% on the

comprising a GaSb gain chip with an integrated tunable Si$_3$N$_4$ Vernier
mirror. At room temperature, the laser exhibited a maximum output power of 15
mW and a tuning range of 80 nm (1937-2017 nm). The low-loss performance of
several fundamental Si$_3$N$_4$ building blocks for photonic integrated
circuits is also validated. More specifically, the single-mode waveguide
exhibit transmission loss as low as 0.15 dB/cm, the 90$^\circ$ bend has 0.008
dB loss, and the 50/50 Y-branch has an insertion loss of 0.075 dB.

based on the contextual distribution of words or other formal units, whereas
any information related to the logographic features of written text are often

statistics. On the other hand, as language models become larger and require
more data to learn reliable representations, such assumptions may start to fall
back, especially under conditions of data sparsity. Many languages, including
Chinese and Vietnamese, use logographic writing systems where surface forms are
represented as a visual organization of smaller graphemic units, which often
contain many semantic cues. In this paper, we present a novel study which
explores the benefits of providing language models with logographic information
in learning better semantic representations. We test our hypothesis in the
natural language inference (NLI) task by evaluating the benefit of computing
multi-modal representations that combine contextual information with glyph

attributes (gender, race, etc.), often resulting in fairness assessments on
populations without knowing their protected groups. In such scenarios,
institutions often adopt a separation between the model developers (who train
models with no access to the protected attributes) and a compliance team (who
may have access to the entire dataset for auditing purposes). However, the
model developers might be allowed to test their models for bias by querying the
compliance team for group fairness metrics. In this paper, we first demonstrate
that simply querying for fairness metrics, such as statistical parity and
equalized odds can leak the protected attributes of individuals to the model
developers. We demonstrate that there always exist strategies by which the
model developers can identify the protected attribute of a targeted individual
in the test dataset from just a single query. In particular, we show that one
can reconstruct the protected attributes of all the individuals from O(Nk \log(
n /Nk)) queries when Nk<<n using techniques from compressed sensing (n: size of
the test dataset, Nk: size of smallest group). Our results pose an interesting
debate in algorithmic fairness: should querying for fairness metrics be viewed
as a neutral-valued solution to ensure compliance with regulations? Or, does it
constitute a violation of regulations and privacy if the number of queries
answered is enough for the model developers to identify the protected
attributes of specific individuals? To address this supposed violation, we also
propose Attribute-Conceal, a novel technique that achieves differential privacy
by calibrating noise to the smooth sensitivity of our bias query, outperforming
naive techniques such as the Laplace mechanism. We also include experimental
results on the Adult dataset and synthetic data.

This is known as distribution mismatch. Such problem generally occurs when the

features of submissions, such as technical quality or novelty. A score is given
to each of the predefined features and based on these the reviewer has to
provide an overall quantitative recommendation. However, reviewers differ in
how much they value different features. It may be assumed that each reviewer
has her own mapping from a set of criteria scores (score vectors) to a
recommendation, and that different reviewers have different mappings in mind.
Recently, Noothigattu, Shah and Procaccia introduced a novel framework for
obtaining an aggregated mapping by means of Empirical Risk Minimization based
on $L(p,q)$ loss functions, and studied its axiomatic properties in the sense
of social choice theory. We provide a body of new results about this framework.
On the one hand we study a trade-off between strategy-proofness and the ability
of the method to properly capture agreements of the majority of reviewers. On
the other hand, we show that dropping a certain unrealistic assumption makes
the previously reported results to be no longer valid. Moreover, in the general
case, strategy-proofness fails dramatically in the sense that a reviewer is
able to make significant changes to the solution in her favor by arbitrarily
small changes to their true beliefs. In particular, no approximate version of
strategy-proofness is possible in this general setting since the method is not
even continuous w.r.t. the data. Finally we propose a modified aggregation
algorithm which is continuous and show that it has good axiomatic properties.

meaningful repeated patterns in time series. Recently, time series chains were
introduced as an expansion of time series motifs to identify the continuous
evolving patterns in time series data. Informally, a time series chain (TSC) is
a temporally ordered set of time series subsequences, in which every
subsequence is similar to the one that precedes it, but the last and the first
can be arbitrarily dissimilar. TSCs are shown to be able to reveal latent
continuous evolving trends in the time series, and identify precursors of
unusual events in complex systems. Despite its promising interpretability,
unfortunately, we have observed that existing TSC definitions lack the ability
to accurately cover the evolving part of a time series: the discovered chains
can be easily cut by noise and can include non-evolving patterns, making them
impractical in real-world applications. Inspired by a recent work that tracks
how the nearest neighbor of a time series subsequence changes over time, we
introduce a new TSC definition which is much more robust to noise in the data,
in the sense that they can better locate the evolving patterns while excluding
the non-evolving ones. We further propose two new quality metrics to rank the
discovered chains. With extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that
the proposed TSC definition is significantly more robust to noise than the
state of the art, and the top ranked chains discovered can reveal meaningful

processes at different sites are independent and identically distributed, and
$\varphi$ is assumed non increasing and vanishing at infinity. We derive a LLN

In the absence of a viable uniform lower bound for the jump rate, we resort
instead to stochastic domination, as well as to a subadditive argument to
control the time spent by the particle to give $n$ jumps; and we also impose
conditions on the initial (product) environmental initial distribution. We also
present results on the asymptotics of the environment seen by the particle

role of ion-neutral interactions in the dynamics of the chromosphere.
Furthermore, the comparison between spectral profiles and synthetic
observations of reconnection events suggest that current MHD approaches appear
to be inconsistent with observations. First, collisions and multi-thermal
aspects of the plasma play a role in these regions. Second, hydrogen and helium
ionization effects are relevant to the energy balance of the chromosphere. This
work investigates multi-fluid multi-species (MFMS) effects on MR in conditions
representative of the upper chromosphere using the multi-fluid Ebysus code. We
compare an MFMS approach based on a helium-hydrogen mixture with a two-fluid
MHD model based on hydrogen only. The simulations of MRs are performed in a
Lundquist number regime high enough to develop plasmoids and instabilities. We
study the evolution of the MR and compare the two approaches including the
structure of the current sheet and plasmoids, the decoupling of the particles,
the evolution of the heating mechanisms, and the composition. The presence of
helium species leads to more efficient heating mechanisms than the two-fluid
case. This scenario, which is out of reach of the two-fluid or single-fluid
models, can reach transition region temperatures starting from upper
chromospheric thermodynamic conditions, representative of a quiet Sun scenario.
The different dynamics between helium and hydrogen species could lead to
chemical fractionation and, under certain conditions, enrichment of helium in
the strongest outflows. This could be of significance for recent observations
of helium enrichment in the solar wind in switchbacks and CMEs.

For one-particle-one-hole model we found there is a deviation from experimental

  By drawing the relationship between temperature versus $\log ft$ values, we
found the general trend is that the strength function values slowly decrease as
temperatures increases. There are fluctuations $\log ft$ due to the strongly
dependent of $\log ft$ on the shell configuration of the valence nucleons.

addressing the question on how the obtained results can be interpreted. Indeed,
while complex machine learning models are able to provide very good results in
terms of accuracy even in challenging applications, it is difficult to
interpret them. Aiming at providing some interpretability for such models, one
of the most famous methods, called SHAP, borrows the Shapley value concept from
game theory in order to locally explain the predicted outcome of an instance of
interest. As the SHAP values calculation needs previous computations on all
possible coalitions of attributes, its computational cost can be very high.
Therefore, a SHAP-based method called Kernel SHAP adopts an efficient strategy
that approximate such values with less computational effort. In this paper, we
also address local interpretability in machine learning based on Shapley
values. Firstly, we provide a straightforward formulation of a SHAP-based
method for local interpretability by using the Choquet integral, which leads to
both Shapley values and Shapley interaction indices. Moreover, we also adopt
the concept of $k$-additive games from game theory, which contributes to reduce
the computational effort when estimating the SHAP values. The obtained results
attest that our proposal needs less computations on coalitions of attributes to
approximate the SHAP values.

potentially sub-optimal for several well-motivated new physics models where new
particles are not particularly heavy and can escape the online selection
criteria of the multi-purpose LHC experiments due to their light mass and small
coupling. A solution may be offered by complementary datasets that are
routinely collected by the LHC experiments. These include heavy ion collisions,
low-pileup runs for precision physics, and the so-called 'parking' and

they all have the usage of mild $p_{T}$ thresholds at the trigger-level in

(slightly) along a trajectory with a slope of $\sim$3. This produces a steeper

for electricity -- system demand less amount of energy produced by intermittent
renewables, hydroelectric units, and net imports -- that must be served by
controllable generation units. Under normal demand conditions, introducing
additional renewable generation capacity reduces net demand. Consequently, the
lockdown can provide insights about electricity market performance with a large
share of renewables. We find that although the lockdown reduced average
day-ahead prices in Italy by 45%, re-dispatch costs increased by 73%, both
relative to the average of the same magnitude for the same period in previous
years. We estimate a deep-learning model using data from 2017--2019 and find
that predicted re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period are only 26% higher
than the same period in previous years. We argue that the difference between
actual and predicted lockdown period re-dispatch costs is the result of
increased opportunities for suppliers with controllable units to exercise
market power in the re-dispatch market in these persistently low net demand
conditions. Our results imply that without grid investments and other
technologies to manage low net demand conditions, an increased share of
intermittent renewables is likely to increase costs of maintaining a reliable
grid.

outcomes of measurements that cannot be performed jointly. In Hilbert space,
the outcomes of such incompatible measurements are represented by
non-orthogonal states. In this paper, we investigate how the relation between
outcomes represented by non-orthogonal quantum states differs from the
relations suggested by a joint assignment of measurement outcomes that do not
depend on the actual measurement context. The analysis is based on a well-known
scenario where three statements about the impossibilities of certain outcomes
would seem to make a specific fourth outcome impossible as well, yet quantum
theory allows the observation of that outcome with a non-vanishing probability.
We show that the Hilbert space formalism modifies the relation between the four
measurement outcomes by defining a lower bound of the fourth probability that
increases as the total probability of the first three outcomes drops to zero.
Quantum theory thus makes the violation of non-contextual consistency between
the measurement outcomes not only possible, but actually requires it as a
necessary consequence of the Hilbert space inner products that describe the
contextual relation between the outcomes of different measurements.

exploits the temperature dependent linewidth broadening measured by resonant

Additionally, it achieves such sensitivities while employing excitation powers

Furthermore, DMs contributed by the IGM ($\mathrm{DM_{IGM}}$) and host galaxy
($\mathrm{DM_{host}}$), important cosmological quantities, cannot be exactly
extracted from observations, which would bring uncontrolled systematic
uncertainties in FRB cosmology. In this work, we use seventeen localized FRBs

cosmological probes such as type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations,
and cosmic microwave background radiation are combined to break parameter
degeneracy. Taking into account the probability distributions of

Apley","Fully Bayesian inference for latent variable Gaussian process models",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real engineering and scientific applications often involve one or more
qualitative inputs. Standard Gaussian processes (GPs), however, cannot directly
accommodate qualitative inputs. The recently introduced latent variable
Gaussian process (LVGP) overcomes this issue by first mapping each qualitative
factor to underlying latent variables (LVs), and then uses any standard GP
covariance function over these LVs. The LVs are estimated similarly to the
other GP hyperparameters through maximum likelihood estimation, and then
plugged into the prediction expressions. However, this plug-in approach will
not account for uncertainty in estimation of the LVs, which can be significant
especially with limited training data. In this work, we develop a fully
Bayesian approach for the LVGP model and for visualizing the effects of the
qualitative inputs via their LVs. We also develop approximations for scaling up
LVGPs and fully Bayesian inference for the LVGP hyperparameters. We conduct
numerical studies comparing plug-in inference against fully Bayesian inference
over a few engineering models and material design applications. In contrast to
previous studies on standard GP modeling that have largely concluded that a
fully Bayesian treatment offers limited improvements, our results show that for
LVGP modeling it offers significant improvements in prediction accuracy and
uncertainty quantification over the plug-in approach.

  Vision-Language Models",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown impressive
generalization capability in downstream vision tasks with appropriate text
prompts. Instead of designing prompts manually, Context Optimization (CoOp) has
been recently proposed to learn continuous prompts using taskspecific training
data. Despite the performance improvements on downstream tasks, several studies
have reported that CoOp suffers from the overfitting issue in two aspects: (i)
the test accuracy on base classes first improves and then worsens during
training;(ii) the test accuracy on novel classes keeps decreasing. However,
none of the existing studies can understand and mitigate such overfitting
problems. In this study, we first explore the cause of overfitting by analyzing
the gradient flow. Comparative experiments reveal that CoOp favors
generalizable and spurious features in the early and later training stages,
respectively, leading to the non-overfitting and overfitting phenomena. Given
those observations, we propose Subspace Prompt Tuning (SubPT) to project the
gradients in back-propagation onto the low-rank subspace spanned by the
early-stage gradient flow eigenvectors during the entire training process and
successfully eliminate the overfitting problem. In addition, we equip CoOp with
a Novel Feature Learner (NFL) to enhance the generalization ability of the
learned prompts onto novel categories beyond the training set, needless of
image training data. Extensive experiments on 11 classification datasets
demonstrate that SubPT+NFL consistently boost the performance of CoOp and
outperform the state-of-the-art CoCoOp approach. Experiments on more
challenging vision downstream tasks, including open-vocabulary object detection
and zero-shot semantic segmentation, also verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Codes can be found at https://tinyurl.com/mpe64f89.

ordinary SNNs with LIF neurons on kinds of architectures and datasets.
Furthermore, we propose a defense method that changes model's gradients by
replacing the form of oscillation, which hides the original training gradients
and confuses the attacker into using gradients of 'fake' neurons to generate
invalid adversarial samples. Our experiments suggest that the proposed defense
method can effectively resist both single-step and iterative attacks with
comparable defense effectiveness and much less computational costs than
adversarial training methods on DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

that the field-induced injection current dominates the anomalous Hall effect
during pump irradiation, while the Berry curvature of the Floquet-Weyl

irradiation, we observe an anomalous Hall effect that lasts for more than 10

creates a polarization of the isospin degree of freedom in the Dirac semimetal,

algorithms with access to weak labelers learn a difference classifier which
predicts where the weak labels differ from strong labelers; this requires the
strong assumption of realizability of the difference classifier (Zhang and

uncovering a novel characteristic of its many-body energy levels. At
temperature below the transition point, the system's low-lying levels exhibit a
fundamental grouping behavior, wherein each level belongs exclusively to a
single group. In a superflow state, the system establishes thermal equilibrium
with its surroundings on a group-specific basis. Specifically, the levels of a
selected group, initially occupied, become thermally populated, while the
remaining groups of levels stay vacant due to absence of transitions between
groups. The macroscopic properties of the system, such as its superflow
velocity and thermal energy density, are statistically determined by the
thermal distribution of the occupied group. Additionally, we infer that the
thermal energy of a superflow has an unusual relationship with flow velocity,
such that the larger the flow velocity, the smaller the thermal energy. This
relationship is responsible for a range of intriguing phenomena, including the
mechano-caloric effect and the fountain effect, which highlight a fundamental
coupling between the thermal motion and hydrodynamic motion of the
system.Furthermore, we present experimental evidence of a counterintuitive
self-heating effect in $^4$He superflows, confirming that a $^4$He superflow
carries significant thermal energy related to its velocity.

Furthermore, the YOLOv4 object detector was trained to localize asteroid

are vulnerable to membership inference on their training datasets. With updated
pre-trained NER models from spaCy, we demonstrate two distinct membership

to be vulnerable to. Our second attack leverages a timing side-channel to
target NER models that maintain vocabularies constructed from the training

dataset in contrast to words not previously seen have measurable differences in
execution time. Revealing membership status of training samples has clear
privacy implications, e.g., in text redaction, sensitive words or phrases to be
found and removed, are at risk of being detected in the training dataset. Our
experimental evaluation includes the redaction of both password and health

exacerbated by results that show memorization with only a single phrase. We
achieved 70% AUC in our first attack on a text redaction use-case. We also show
overwhelming success in the timing attack with 99.23% AUC. Finally we discuss
potential mitigation approaches to realize the safe use of NER models in light

white dwarf systems exhibit infrared excess emission and/or spectral absorption
lines associated with a reservoir of dust (or planetesimals) and its accretion.
However, most white dwarfs are too cool to sufficiently heat any circumstellar
dust to detectable levels of emission. The Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) is a young,
nearby planetary nebula; observations at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths
revealed excess emission associated with its central white dwarf (WD 2226-210).
The origin of this excess is ambiguous. It could be a remnant planetesimal
belt, a cloud of comets, or the remnants of material shed during the
post-asymptotic giant branch phase. Here we combine infrared (SOFIA, Spitzer,
Herschel ) and millimetre (ALMA) observations of the system to determine the
origin of this excess using multi-wavelength imaging and radiative transfer
modelling. We find the data are incompatible with a compact remnant
planetesimal belt or post-asymptotic giant branch disc, and conclude the dust
most likely originates from deposition by a cometary cloud. The measured dust
mass, and lifetime of the constituent grains, implies disruption of several
thousand Hale-Bopp equivalent comets per year to fuel the observed excess
emission around the Helix Nebula's white dwarf.

Considering pair interactions for spherical clean bubbles, bubble chains should
not be stable which contradicts these observations. The aim of this work is to
explain the conditions for bubble chain stability. For this purpose,
experiments and direct numerical simulation are conducted. The bubble size as
well as the level of interface contamination are varied, to match the range of

stability. The transition from stable to ustable behavior results from the
reversal of the lift force, which is induced by the bubble wake. A criteria

relative to vanilla gradient methods. The traditional viewpoint in
optimization, particularly in convex optimization, explains this improved
performance by arguing that, unlike vanilla gradient schemes, adaptive
algorithms mimic the behavior of a second-order method by adapting to the
global geometry of the loss function. We argue that in the context of neural
network optimization, this traditional viewpoint is insufficient. Instead, we
advocate for a local trajectory analysis. For iterate trajectories produced by
running a generic optimization algorithm OPT, we introduce
$R^{\text{OPT}}_{\text{med}}$, a statistic that is analogous to the condition
number of the loss Hessian evaluated at the iterates. Through extensive
experiments, we show that adaptive methods such as Adam bias the trajectories
towards regions where $R^{\text{Adam}}_{\text{med}}$ is small, where one might
expect faster convergence. By contrast, vanilla gradient methods like SGD bias
the trajectories towards regions where $R^{\text{SGD}}_{\text{med}}$ is
comparatively large. We complement these empirical observations with a
theoretical result that provably demonstrates this phenomenon in the simplified
setting of a two-layer linear network. We view our findings as evidence for the
need of a new explanation of the success of adaptive methods, one that is
different than the conventional wisdom.

in both clinical practice and radiomics research. Segmentation in medicine is
now often performed manually by experts, which is a laborious, expensive and
error-prone task. Manual annotation relies heavily on the experience and
knowledge of these experts. In addition, there is much intra- and interobserver
variation. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a method that can
automatically segment tumor target regions. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning segmentation method based on multimodal positron emission
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), which combines the high sensitivity of
PET and the precise anatomical information of CT. We design an improved spatial
attention network(ISA-Net) to increase the accuracy of PET or CT in detecting
tumors, which uses multi-scale convolution operation to extract feature
information and can highlight the tumor region location information and
suppress the non-tumor region location information. In addition, our network
uses dual-channel inputs in the coding stage and fuses them in the decoding
stage, which can take advantage of the differences and complementarities
between PET and CT. We validated the proposed ISA-Net method on two clinical
datasets, a soft tissue sarcoma(STS) and a head and neck tumor(HECKTOR)
dataset, and compared with other attention methods for tumor segmentation. The
DSC score of 0.8378 on STS dataset and 0.8076 on HECKTOR dataset show that
ISA-Net method achieves better segmentation performance and has better
generalization. Conclusions: The method proposed in this paper is based on
multi-modal medical image tumor segmentation, which can effectively utilize the
difference and complementarity of different modes. The method can also be
applied to other multi-modal data or single-modal data by proper adjustment.

assumptions on $f$ such as monotonicity.
  Our first result is a $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{NP}}$ algorithm for the general

extreme sensitivity. QSs have been used in several applications such as atomic
interferometers, but few applications of a quantum sensor network (QSN) have
been proposed or developed. We look at a natural application of QSN --
localization of an event (in particular, of a wireless signal transmitter). In
this paper, we develop effective quantum-based techniques for the localization
of a transmitter using a QSN. Our approaches pose the localization problem as a
well-studied quantum state discrimination (QSD) problem and address the
challenges in its application to the localization problem. In particular, a
quantum state discrimination solution can suffer from a high probability of
error, especially when the number of states (i.e., the number of potential
transmitter locations in our case) can be high. We address this challenge by
developing a two-level localization approach, which localizes the transmitter
at a coarser granularity in the first level, and then, in a finer granularity
in the second level. We address the additional challenge of the impracticality
of general measurements by developing new schemes that replace the QSD's
measurement operator with a trained parameterized hybrid quantum-classical
circuit. Our evaluation results using a custom-built simulator show that our
best scheme is able to achieve meter-level (1-5m) localization accuracy; in the
case of discrete locations, it achieves near-perfect (99-100\%) classification
accuracy.

contributes to various research areas, such as forecasting earthquakes and
understanding the crust/mantle structure. Recent advances in machine learning
technologies have enabled the automatic detection of earthquakes from waveform
data. In particular, various state-of-the-art deep-learning methods have been
applied to this endeavour. In this study, we proposed and tested a novel phase
detection method employing deep learning, which is based on a standard
convolutional neural network in a new framework. The novelty of the proposed
method is its separate explicit learning strategy for global and local
representations of waveforms, which enhances its robustness and flexibility.
Prior to modelling the proposed method, we identified local representations of
the waveform by the multiple clustering of waveforms, in which the data points
were optimally partitioned. Based on this result, we considered a global
representation and two local representations of the waveform. Subsequently,
different phase detection models were trained for each global and local
representation. For a new waveform, the overall phase probability was evaluated
as a product of the phase probabilities of each model. This additional
information on local representations makes the proposed method robust to noise,
which is demonstrated by its application to the test data. Furthermore, an
application to seismic swarm data demonstrated the robust performance of the
proposed method compared with those of other deep learning methods. Finally, in
an application to low-frequency earthquakes, we demonstrated the flexibility of
the proposed method, which is readily adaptable for the detection of
low-frequency earthquakes by retraining only a local model.

silicone oil to span the range where the PDMS is fluid free (via solvent
extraction) up to the limit where it is oil saturated. Probe tack measurements
show that adhesion decreases rapidly with an increase in oil fraction. The
decrease in adhesion is attributed to excess oil present at the PDMS-air

this observation. Adhesion also increases with contact time for a given oil
fraction. The increase in adhesion with contact time can be interpreted through
different competing mechanisms that depend on the oil fraction where the
dominant mechanism changes from extracted to fully swollen PDMS. For partially
swollen PDMS, we observe that adhesion initially increases because of
viscoelastic relaxation and at long times increases because of contact aging.
In contrast, adhesion between fully swollen PDMS and glass barely increases
over time and is mainly due to capillary forces. While the relaxation of PDMS
in contact is well-described by a visco-poroelastic model, we do not see
evidence that poroelastic relaxation of the PDMS contributes to an increase of

model of $\pi$-conjugated electrons and use the Ehrenfest equations of motion
to simulate the coupled nuclei dynamics. To account for the experimental and
theoretical uncertainty in the relative energetic ordering of the nominal
$1^1B_u^+$ and $2^1A_g^-$ states at the Franck-Condon point, we consider two
parameter sets. In both cases there is ultrafast internal conversion from the
'bright' state to a 'dark' singlet triplet-pair state. We make a direct
connection from our predictions to experimental observables by calculating the
transient absorption. For the case of direct $1^1B_u^+$ to $2^1A_g^-$ internal
conversion, we show that the dominant transition at ca. 2 eV, being close to
but lower in energy than the $T_1$ to $T_1^*$ transition, can be attributed to
the $2^1A_g^-$ component of $S_1$. Moreover, we show that it is the
charge-transfer exciton component of the $2^1A_g^-$ state that is responsible
for this transition, and not its triplet-pair component. We next discuss the
microscopic mechanism of 'bright' to 'dark' state internal conversion,
emphasising that this occurs via the exciton components of both states.
Finally, we describe a mechanism whereby the strongly bound intrachain
triplet-pairs of the 'dark' state may undergo interchain exothermic
dissociation. We predict that this is only possible if the molecules are
twisted in their ground states. The computational methodology underlying the
calculations described here is explained in our companion paper,

Magnetic field parameters derived from photospheric vector magnetograms of
solar active regions have been used to analyze and forecast eruptive events
such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Unfortunately, the most recent
solar cycle 24 was relatively weak with few large flares, though it is the only
solar cycle in which consistent time-sequence vector magnetograms have been
available through the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) since its launch in 2010. In this paper, we look
into another major instrument, namely the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on
board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) from 1996 to 2010. The data
archive of SOHO/MDI covers more active solar cycle 23 with many large flares.
However, SOHO/MDI data only has line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. We propose a
new deep learning method, named MagNet, to learn from combined LOS
magnetograms, Bx and By taken by SDO/HMI along with H-alpha observations
collected by the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and to generate vector
components Bx' and By', which would form vector magnetograms with observed LOS
data. In this way, we can expand the availability of vector magnetograms to the
period from 1996 to present. Experimental results demonstrate the good
performance of the proposed method. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that deep learning has been used to generate photospheric vector magnetograms
of solar active regions for SOHO/MDI using SDO/HMI and H-alpha data.

results of one non-detection in a dwarf galaxy (FRB20121102A) and two events
detected in M81 (FRB20200120E) and the Milky Way (FRB20200428A). The CO

in molecular gas properties (gas mass, gas depletion time, and gas fraction to
stellar mass) in the sample. Compared to other star-forming galaxies, the
FRB20180924B host is gas-rich (the larger molecular gas fraction), and the
hosts of FRB20190102C and FRB20200120E are gas-poor with a shorter depletion
time for their stellar mass and star-formation rate. Our findings suggest that
FRBs arise from multiple progenitors or single progenitors that can exist in a
wide range of galaxy environments. Statistical analysis shows a significant
difference in the distribution of molecular gas fraction between the FRB hosts
and local star-forming galaxies. However, the difference is not substantial
when an outlier, the FRB20200120E host, is excluded, and analysis with a larger

galaxy, there are the following four nuclear radio sources; NE, C, S1, and S2.
Among them, the S1 component has been identified as the nucleus while the C
component has been considered as attributed to the radio jet. In our VLBI
observation, we find the following two types of the water maser emission at the
S1 component. One is the linearly aligned component that is considered as an
edge-on disk with the inner radius of 0.62 pc. The dynamical mass enclosed
within the inner radius was estimated to be $1.5\times10^7 M_{\odot}$ by
assuming the circular Keplerian motion. Note, however, that the best fit
rotation curve shows a sub-Keplerian rotation ($v\propto r^{-0.24\pm0.10}$).
The other is the water maser emission distributed around the rotating disk
component up to 1.5 pc from the S1 component, suggesting the bipolar outflow
from the S1 component. Further, we detected the water maser emission in the C
component for the first time with VLBI, and discovered a ring-like distribution
of the water maser emission. It is known that a molecular cloud is associated
with the C component (both HCN and HCO$^+$ emission lines are detected by
ALMA). Therefore, the ring-like maser emission can be explained by the jet
collision to the molecular cloud. However, if these ring-like water masing
clouds constitute a rotating ring around the C component, it is likely that the
C component also has a supermassive black hole with the mass of $\sim 10^6
M_{\odot}$ that could be supplied from a past minor merger of a nucleated
satellite galaxy.

Specifically, we introduce a nonlinear transform to map the speech source to

we build an entropy model on the latent space to estimate the importance
diversity among semantic feature embeddings. Accordingly, these semantic

of our model leads to a flexible rate-distortion (RD) trade-off, supporting
versatile wireless speech semantic transmission. Experimental results verify

to deal with one's own problems. Because success of imitation generally depends
on whether profit of an imitating agent coincides with those of other agents or
not, game theory is suitable for specifying situations where imitation can be
successful. One of the concepts describing successfulness of imitation in
repeated two-player symmetric games is unbeatability. For infinitely repeated
two-player symmetric games, a necessary and sufficient condition for some
imitation strategy to be unbeatable was specified. However, situations where
imitation can be unbeatable in multi-player games are still not clear. In order
to analyze successfulness of imitation in multi-player situations, here we
introduce a class of totally symmetric games called unexploitable games, which
is a natural extension of two-player symmetric games without exploitation
cycles. We then prove that, for infinitely repeated unexploitable games, there
exist unbeatable imitation strategies. Furthermore, we also prove that, for
infinitely repeated non-trivial unexploitable games, there exist unbeatable
zero-determinant strategies, which unilaterally enforce some relationships on
payoffs of players. These claims are demonstrated in the public goods game,
which is the simplest unexploitable game. These results show that there are

Efficient data placement is challenging since I/O density is usually unknown at
the time data needs to be placed. Additionally, external factors such as load
variability, job preemption, or job priorities can impact job completion times,
which ultimately affect the I/O density of the temporary files in the workload.
In this paper, we envision that machine learning can be used to solve this
problem. We analyze production logs from Google's data centers for a range of
data processing pipelines. Our analysis shows that I/O density may be
predictable. This suggests that learning-based strategies, if crafted
carefully, could extract predictive features for I/O density of temporary files
involved in various transformations, which could be used to improve the

Identifying such pairs requires comparing examples with respect to unknown

long-standing issue: despite several processes known to originate this line
(e.g. AGN, star formation, cold accretion, shock heating), it is difficult to
discriminate among these phenomena based on observations. Recent studies have
suggested that the comparison of the ultraviolet (UV) and optical properties of
these sources could solve the riddle. For this reason, we investigate the
rest-frame UV and optical properties of A2895b, a strongly lensed
Ly${\alpha}$-emitter at redshift z ~ 3.7. From this study, we find that our
target is a compact (r ~ 1.2 pkpc) star-forming (star formation rate ~ 11
M$_{\odot}$/yr) galaxy having a young stellar population. Interestingly, we
measure a high ratio of the H${\beta}$ and the UV continuum monochromatic
luminosities (L(H${\beta}$)/L(UV) ~ 100). Based on tracks of theoretical
stellar models (Starburst99, BPASS), we can only partially explain this result
by assuming a recent (< 10 Myr), bursty episode of star-formation and
considering models characterised by binary stars, a top-heavy initial-mass
function (IMF) and sub-solar metallicities (Z < 0.01 Z$_{\odot}$). These
assumptions also explain the observed low (C/O) abundance of our target (~
0.23(C/O)$_{\odot}$). By comparing the UV and optical datasets, we find that
the Ly${\alpha}$ and UV continuum are more extended (x2) than the Balmer lines,
and that the peak of the Ly${\alpha}$ is offset (~ 0.6 pkpc). The
multi-wavelength results of our analysis suggest that the observed Ly${\alpha}$
emission originates from a recent star-formation burst, likely taking place in
an off-centre clump.

challenges for 5G and beyond mobile networks. To enhance the network capacity

duplexing (D-TFDD) scheme that adaptively allocates the uplink and downlink
time-frequency resources of base stations (BSs) to meet the asymmetric and
heterogeneous traffic demands while alleviating the inter-cell interference. We
formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
process (Dec-POMDP) that maximizes the long-term expected sum rate under the
users' packet dropping ratio constraints. In order to jointly optimize the
global resources in a decentralized manner, we propose a federated
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm named federated Wolpertinger deep
deterministic policy gradient (FWDDPG) algorithm. The BSs decide their local
time-frequency configurations through RL algorithms and achieve global training
via exchanging local RL models with their neighbors under a decentralized
federated learning framework. Specifically, to deal with the large-scale
discrete action space of each BS, we adopt a DDPG-based algorithm to generate
actions in a continuous space, and then utilize Wolpertinger policy to reduce
the mapping errors from continuous action space back to discrete action space.
Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm to
benchmark algorithms with respect to system sum rate.

oxygen and water chemistry. However, despite the large number of H$_3$O$^+$
observations, its collisional excitation was investigated only partially. In
the present work we study the state-to-state rotational de-excitation of

$para$-H$_2$. The cross sections are calculated within the close-coupling
formalism using a highly accurate potential energy surface developed for this
system. The rate coefficients are computed up to $300$ K kinetic temperature.
Transitions between the lowest 21 rotation-inversion states were studied for
$para$-H$_3$O$^+$, and the lowest 11 states for $ortho$-H$_3$O$^+$, i.e. all
levels with rotational energies below 430 K ($\sim 300$ cm$^{-1}$) are
considered (up to $j\leq5$). In order to estimate the impact of the new rate
coefficients on the astrophysical models for H$_3$O$^+$, radiative transfer
calculations were also carried out. We have examined how the new collisional
data affect the line intensities with respect to older data previously used for
the interpretation of observations. By analysing all detected transitions we
find that our new, accurate rate coefficients have a significant impact
(typically within a factor of 2) on radiation temperatures, allowing more
accurate estimation of column densities and relative abundances of hydronium,
especially in warm molecular clouds, paving the path towards better

smaller ring width. We also determine the range of the initial planetesimal

share the same set of vertices, into groups of networks with similar topology.
A statistical model-based approach based on a finite mixture of stochastic
block models is proposed. A clustering is obtained by maximizing the integrated
classification likelihood criterion. This is done by a hierarchical
agglomerative algorithm, that starts from singleton clusters and successively
merges clusters of networks. As such, a sequence of nested clusterings is
computed that can be represented by a dendrogram providing valuable insights on
the collection of networks. Using a Bayesian framework, model selection is
performed in an automated way since the algorithm stops when the best number of
clusters is attained. The algorithm is computationally efficient, when
carefully implemented. The aggregation of groups of networks requires a means
to overcome the label-switching problem of the stochastic block model and to
match the block labels of the graphs. To address this problem, a new tool is
proposed based on a comparison of the graphons of the associated stochastic
block models. The clustering approach is assessed on synthetic data. An
application to a collection of ecological networks illustrates the
interpretability of the obtained results.

constraints of a discrete energy modeling multicomponents rotating
Bose-Einstein condensates in the regime of strong confinement and with
rotation. Moreover, we consider both segregation and coexistence regimes
between the components. The method includes a discretization of a continuous
energy in space dimension 2 and a gradient algorithm with adaptive time step
and projection for the minimization. It is well known that, depending on the
regime, the minimizers may display different structures, sometimes with
vorticity (from singly quantized vortices, to vortex sheets and giant holes).
In order to study numerically the structures of the minimizers, we introduce in
this paper a numerical algorithm for the computation of the indices of the
vortices, as well as an algorithm for the computation of the indices of vortex
sheets. Several computations are carried out, to illustrate the efficiency of
the method, to cover different physical cases, to validate recent theoretical
results as well as to support conjectures. Moreover, we compare this method
with an alternative method from the literature.

we use the Swin Transformer to calculate multi-level features, and then feed

platforms, and requires that they scale resource up and down in response to
changing workloads. Serverless platforms scale-down resources by terminating
previously launched instances (which are containers or processes). The
serverless programming model ensures that terminating instances is safe
assuming all application code running on the instance has either completed or
timed out. Safety thus depends on the serverless platform's correctly
determining that application processing is complete.
  In this paper, we start with the observation that current serverless
platforms do not account for pending asynchronous I/O operations when
determining whether application processing is complete. These platforms are
thus unsafe when executing programs that use asynchronous I/O, and incorrectly
deciding that application processing has terminated can result in data
inconsistency when these platforms are used. We show that the reason for this
problem is that current serverless semantics couple termination and response

extension to current semantics that decouples response generation and

extending OpenWhisk, an open source serverless platform.

the expected latency at each diagonal line on the lattice, and show that its
gradient can be computed efficiently within the forward-backward algorithm.
Then we augment the transducer loss with this expected latency, so that an
optimal trade-off between latency and accuracy is achieved. Experimental
results on the WSJ dataset show that the proposed minimum latency training
reduces the latency of causal Conformer-T from 220 ms to 27 ms within a WER
degradation of 0.7%, and outperforms conventional alignment-restricted training

$R_2(nK_3)=5n$ for $n\ge2$. However, determining the exact value of $R_2(F_n)$
is notoriously difficult. So far, only $R_2(F_2)=9$ has been proved. Notice
that both $F_n$ and $nK_3$ contain $n$ triangles and $|V(F_n)|<|V(nK_3)|$ for
all $n\ge 2$. Chen, Yu and Zhao (2021) speculated that $R_2(F_n)\le
R_2(nK_3)=5n$ for $n$ sufficiently large. In this paper, we first prove that
$R(K_{1,n},F_n)=3n-\varepsilon$ for $n\ge1$, where $\varepsilon=0$ if $n$ is
odd and $\varepsilon=1$ if $n$ is even. Applying the exact values of
$R(K_{1,n},F_n)$, we will confirm $R_2(F_n)\le 5n$ for $n=3$ by showing that
$R_2(F_3)=14$.

coupled, they are not operated in a coordinated manner. With increasing
penetration of renewable energy sources, a coordinated market-based operation
of the two networks can yield significant advantages, as reduced need for grid
reinforcements, by optimizing the power flows in the coupled systems.
Transactive control has been developed as a promising approach based on market
and control mechanisms to coordinate supply and demand in energy systems, which
when applied to power systems is being referred to as transactive energy.
However, this approach has not been fully investigated in the context of
market-based operation of coupled electric power and district heating networks.
Therefore, this paper proposes a transactive control approach to coordinate
flexible producers and consumers while taking into account the operational
aspects of both networks, for the benefit of all participants and considering
their privacy. A nonlinear model predictive control approach is applied in this
work to maximize the social welfare of both networks, taking into account
system operational limits, while reducing losses and considering system
dynamics and forecasted power supply and demand of inflexible producers and
consumers. A subtle approximation of the operational optimization problem is
used to enable the practical application of the proposed approach in real time.
The presented technique is implemented, tested, and demonstrated in a realistic

to check that the realisations from the stochastic compartmental model adhere

  Problems","Extended version of conference paper which appeared in the

systems: can a linear recurrence sequence (LRS) ever reach 0 from a given
initial configuration? Similarly, the positivity problem asks whether the LRS
stays positive from an initial configuration. Deciding Skolem (or positivity)
has been open for half a century: the best known decidability results are for
LRS with special properties (e.g., low order recurrences). But these problems
are easier for ``uninitialized'' variants, where the initial configuration is
not fixed but can vary arbitrarily: checking if there is an initial
configuration from which the LRS stays positive can be decided in polynomial
time (Tiwari in 2004, Braverman in 2006).
  In this paper, we consider problems that lie between the initialized and
uninitialized variant. More precisely, we ask if 0 (resp. negative numbers) can
be avoided from every initial configuration in a neighborhood of a given
initial configuration. This can be considered as a robust variant of the Skolem
(resp. positivity) problem. We show that these problems lie at the frontier of
decidability: if the neighbourhood is given as part of the input, then robust
Skolem and robust positivity are Diophantine hard, i.e., solving either would
entail major breakthrough in Diophantine approximations, as happens for
(non-robust) positivity. However, if one asks whether such a neighbourhood
exists, then the problems turn out to be decidable with PSPACE complexity.
  Our techniques also allow us to tackle robustness for ultimate positivity,
which asks whether there is a bound on the number of steps after which the LRS
remains positive. There are two variants depending on whether we ask for a
``uniform'' bound on this number of steps. For the non-uniform variant, when
the neighbourhood is open, the problem turns out to be tractable, even when the
neighbourhood is given as input.

the learning power of Vision Transformers (ViT) is combined with a diminished
need for large volume of data as made possible by the convolution. This is
important in SER, where large corpora of data are usually not available. The
speaker embedding allows the network to extract an identity representation of
the speaker, which is then integrated by means of a self-attention mechanism
with the features that the CCT extracts from the spectrogram. Overall, the
solution is capable of operating in real-time showing promising results in a

the scaling relation $\lambda_s/\lambda_D\sim (a/\lambda_D)^n$, where
$\lambda_D$ is the Debye screening length and $a$ is the ionic diameter.
However, different values of n were found in different studies. In this work we
solve this puzzle within the mesocopic theory that yielded n=3 in agreement
with experiments, but only very high densities of ions were considered [A.
Ciach A. and O. Patsahan, {\it J.Phys.: Condens. Matter} {\textbf 33}, 37LT01

find that different values of n in the above scaling can yield a fair
approximation for $\lambda_s/\lambda_D$ for different ranges of $a/\lambda_D$.
The experimentally found scaling holds for $2 <a/\lambda_D<4$, and we find n=3
for the same range of the reduced Debye length. For smaller $a/\lambda_D$, we
find n=2 obtained earlier in several simulation and theoretical studies, and
still closer to the Kirkwood line we obtain n=1.5 that was also predicted in
different works. It follows from our theory that n=3 (i.e. $\lambda_s$ is
proportional to the density of ions) when the variance of the local charge
density is large, and $\lambda_s$ is proportional to this variance times the
Bjerrum length. Detailed derivation of the theory is presented.

challenging statistical problem as long time series may have change points,
most importantly in the mean and the marginal covariances, for which one needs
valid tests. Inference for large covariance matrices is especially difficult
due to noise accumulation, resulting in singular estimates and poor power of
related tests. The singularity of the sample covariance matrix in high
dimensions can be overcome by considering a linear combination with a regular,
more structured target matrix. This approach is known as shrinkage, and the
target matrix is typically of diagonal form. In this paper, we consider
covariance shrinkage towards structured nonparametric estimators of the
bandable or Toeplitz type, respectively, aiming at improved estimation accuracy
and statistical power of tests even under nonstationarity. We derive feasible
Gaussian approximation results for bilinear projections of the shrinkage
estimators which are valid under nonstationarity and dependence. These
approximations especially enable us to formulate a statistical test for
structural breaks in the marginal covariance structure of high-dimensional time
series without restrictions on the dimension, and which is robust against
nonstationarity of nuisance parameters. We show via simulations that shrinkage
helps to increase the power of the proposed tests. Moreover, we suggest a
data-driven choice of the shrinkage weights, and assess its performance by
means of a Monte Carlo study. The results indicate that the proposed shrinkage
estimator is superior for non-Toeplitz covariance structures close to
fractional Gaussian noise.

boost translational diffusion of an enzyme. A systematic theory of this

underlie the observations of reaction-induced diffusion enhancement in enzymes.
Major experimental findings, such as the occurrence of leaps, the

contribute significantly to the growth of the MBH, especially in dense nuclear
star clusters (NSCs). Yet, this tidal disruption accretion (TDA) of stars onto
the MBH has largely been overlooked compared to the gas accretion (GA) channel
in most numerical experiments until now. In this work, we implement a black
hole growth channel via TDA in the high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement
code Enzo to investigate its influence on a MBH seed's early evolution. We find
that a MBH seed grows rapidly from $10^3\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ to $\gtrsim
10^6\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in 200\,Myrs in some of the tested simulations.
Compared to a MBH seed that grows only via GA, TDA can enhance the MBH's growth
rate by up to more than an order of magnitude. However, as predicted, TDA
mainly helps the early growth of the MBH (from $10^{3-4}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ to
$\lesssim10^{5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) while the later evolution is generally
dominated by GA. We also observe that the star formation near the MBH is
suppressed when TDA is most active, sometimes with a visible cavity in gas (of
size $\sim$ a few pc) created in the vicinity of the MBH. It is because the MBH
may grow expeditiously with both GA and TDA, and the massive MBH could consume
its neighboring gas faster than being replenished by gas inflows. Our study
demonstrates the need to consider different channels of black hole accretion
that may provide clues for the existence of supermassive black holes at high

quantification of the level of clinical equipoise at design stage and requires
the design to be appropriate to disturb this initial equipoise by a
pre-specified amount. Four examples are discussed, illustrating the design of
phase II-III trials with binary or time to event endpoints. Sample sizes are
shown to be conductive to strong levels of overall evidence, whether positive

more naturally arising than the recently popular ""strong nonlocality"" in the

work, we study the distinguishability-based genuine nonlocality of a special
type of genuinely multipartite entangled states -- the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states. We first show that any 5 states
of the three-qubit GHZ basis are genuinely nonlocal, while any 4 states of them
are not. Then for more general tripartite systems, we present a universal bound
about the cardinality for an arbitrary set of GHZ-like states to be genuinely
nonlocal. Although not necessary, entanglement is believed to raise difficulty
in state discrimination in many situations. In the literature, there has been
lots of studies in favor of this perspective, including the efforts seeking for
small nonlocal sets consisting of maximally entangled states in bipartite
systems. Here in the tripartite case, where GHZ-like states are studied, we
also find the existence of some small genuinely nonlocal sets: we show that the
cardinality can scale down to linear in the local dimension d. This result not
only substantiates the aforemention perspective in multipartite scenario, but
also suggests that there might exist substantial difference between strong
nonlocality and the normal distinguishability-based multipartite nonlocality.

reported, and is now complete down to m_F606W~29.7. We have performed robust
and conclusive comparisons with model predictions that show how the theoretical
LF for hydrogen envelope WD models closely follow the shape of the empirical
LF. The magnitude of the peak of the observed LF is matched with ages between
12.7 and 13.5 Gyr, consistent with the cluster age derived from the main
sequence turn off and subgiant branch. We also find that the impact of multiple
populations within the cluster on the WD LF for m_F606W below 27.3 is
negligible, and that the presence of a small fraction of helium envelope
objects is consistent with the data. Our analysis reveals a possible hint of an
underestimate of the cooling timescales of models in the magnitude range 28.1 <

requests arrive over time in a metric space of $n$ points. When a request
arrives the algorithm must choose to either match or delay the request. The
goal is to create a perfect matching of all requests while minimising the sum
of distances between matched requests, and the total delay costs incurred by
each of the requests. In contrast to previous work we study MPMD-Set in the
non-clairvoyant setting, where the algorithm does not know the future delay

the natural special case of size-based delay where the delay is a

the first non-clairvoyant algorithms for online min-cost perfect matching with

researchers have long ignored or used inappropriate ways to undermine this
positive relationship. In this article, We construct a simple but efficient

Specifically, we propose that it is easier to establish links between nodes

huge potential for applications in nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. Here,
we predict, based on first-principle calculations, a single phase {\it
triferroic} where three ferroic orders; ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity and
ferroelasticity, coexist simultaneously in hole doped GdCl$_2$ monolayer (a
ferromagnetic semiconductor). This is achieved by substituting 1/3rd of the
Gd$^{2+}$ ions with Eu$^{2+}$ in the hexagonal structure of GdCl$_2$ monolayer.
The resulting metallic state undergoes a bond-centered charge ordering driving
a distortion in the hexagonal structure making it semiconducting again and {\it
ferroelastic}. Further, the lattice distortion accompanied by a breaking of the
lattice centrosymmetry renders a non-centrosymmetric charge distribution which
makes the monolayer {\it ferroelectric}, at the same time. The two ferroic
orders, ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity, present in Eu doped GdCl$_2$
monolayer are found to be strongly coupled making it a promising candidate for
device applications. The doped monolayer remains a ferromagnetic semiconductor
with large 4f magnetic moment just like the parent monolayer and possesses an
even higher (out-of-plane) magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) than its pristine
counterpart as desired for two dimensional magnets to have high transition
temperature.

  level-of-detail network trained on multi-site data",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many clinical and research studies of the human brain require an accurate
structural MRI segmentation. While traditional atlas-based methods can be
applied to volumes from any acquisition site, recent deep learning algorithms
ensure very high accuracy only when tested on data from the same sites
exploited in training (i.e., internal data). The performance degradation
experienced on external data (i.e., unseen volumes from unseen sites) is due to
the inter-site variabilities in intensity distributions induced by different MR
scanner models, acquisition parameters, and unique artefacts. To mitigate this
site-dependency, often referred to as the scanner effect, we propose LOD-Brain,
a 3D convolutional neural network with progressive levels-of-detail (LOD) able
to segment brain data from any site. Coarser network levels are responsible to
learn a robust anatomical prior useful for identifying brain structures and
their locations, while finer levels refine the model to handle site-specific
intensity distributions and anatomical variations. We ensure robustness across
sites by training the model on an unprecedented rich dataset aggregating data
from open repositories: almost 27,000 T1w volumes from around 160 acquisition
sites, at 1.5 - 3T, from a population spanning from 8 to 90 years old.
Extensive tests demonstrate that LOD-Brain produces state-of-the-art results,
with no significant difference in performance between internal and external
sites, and robust to challenging anatomical variations. Its portability opens
the way for large scale application across different healthcare institutions,
patient populations, and imaging technology manufacturers. Code, model, and
demo are available at the project website.

low-rank tensor recovery, which minimizes the convex surrogate of tensor rank
by shrinking each tensor singular values equally. However, for real-world
visual data, large singular values represent more signifiant information than
small singular values. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex TRPCA (N-TRPCA)
model based on the tensor adjustable logarithmic norm. Unlike TRPCA, our
N-TRPCA can adaptively shrink small singular values more and shrink large
singular values less. In addition, TRPCA assumes that the whole data tensor is
of low rank. This assumption is hardly satisfied in practice for natural visual
data, restricting the capability of TRPCA to recover the edges and texture
details from noisy images and videos. To this end, we integrate nonlocal
self-similarity into N-TRPCA, and further develop a nonconvex and nonlocal
TRPCA (NN-TRPCA) model. Specifically, similar nonlocal patches are grouped as a
tensor and then each group tensor is recovered by our N-TRPCA. Since the
patches in one group are highly correlated, all group tensors have strong
low-rank property, leading to an improvement of recovery performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NN-TRPCA outperforms some
existing TRPCA methods in visual data recovery. The demo code is available at

deflection angle diverges as the distance from the lens object increases, owing
to the non-asymptotically flat spacetime. Nevertheless, the divergence can be

that the real quasinormal modes and damping rates are significantly impacted by

results show that with an increase in the boundary term parameter $c_0$, the

a narrow `Main filament' running north-south and a perpendicular `Head'

column density maps, 8 of which are protostellar. However, the star formation
activity is not evenly spread across G214.5 but rather predominantly located in
the Main filament. Studying the Main filament in a manner similar to previous
works, we find that G214.5 is most like a 'Bone' candidate GMF, highly
elongated and massive, but it is colder and narrower than any such GMF. It also
differs significantly due to its low fraction of high column density gas.
Studying the radial profile, we discover that G214.5 is highly asymmetric and
resembles filaments which are known to be compressed externally. Considering
its environment, we find that G214.5 is co-incident, spatially and
kinematically, with a HI superbubble. We discuss how a potential interaction

In our analysis, we performed an initial selection based on the rotation period

extracted from fractal analysis. To refine our analysis, we applied a fractal
approach known as the R/S method, taking into account the fluctuations of the
features associated with photometric modulation at different time intervals and
the fractality traces that are present in the time series of our sample. In
this sense, we computed the so-called Hurst exponent for the referred stars and
found that it can provide a strong discriminant of rotational modulation and
background noise behavior, going beyond what can be achieved with solely the
rotation period itself. Furthermore, our results emphasize that the rotation
period of stars is scaled by the exponent H which increases following the
increase in the rotation period. Finally, our approach suggests that the

for only those compact stellar structures whose compactness lies in between
0.33 and 0.44. Alternatively, GWE can be obtained for those compact stars which
feature a photon sphere and compactness not crossing the Buchdahl's limit
radius $R_{B}=9/4M$. A photon sphere is a surface located at $R=3M$, $R$ being

using the simplest MIT Bag model Equation of State (EoS) it has been reported

view of this, for a comparative study, we have calculated the respective echo
frequencies associated with strange stars by considering three models of
strange star EoSs, viz., MIT bag model, linear and polytropic EoSs \cite{JB}.
We found that, not being too stiff the polytropic EoS can not emit GWE, whereas
the MIT Bag model and the linear EoSs can emit GWEs at a frequency range of
about tens of kilohertz. Also, GWE frequency increases with the increase in
values of bag constant $B$ and decreases with the increasing values of linear

say that $P'$ contains a copy of $P$ if for some injective function $f\colon
P\rightarrow P'$ and for any $A, B\in P$, $A\leq _P B$ if and only if
$f(A)\leq_{P'} f(B)$. For any posets $P$ and $Q$, the poset Ramsey number
$R(P,Q)$ is the least positive integer $N$ such that no matter how the elements
of an $N$-dimensional Boolean lattice are colored in blue and red, there is
either a copy of $P$ with all blue elements or a copy of $Q$ with all red
elements.
  We focus on the poset Ramsey number $R(P, Q_n)$ for a fixed poset $P$ and an
$n$-dimensional Boolean lattice $Q_n$, as $n$ grows large. It is known that
$n+c_1(P) \leq R(P,Q_n) \leq c_2(P) n$, for positive constants $c_1$ and $c_2$.
However, there is no poset $P$ known, for which $R(P, Q_n)> (1+\epsilon)n$, for
$\epsilon >0$. This paper is devoted to a new method for finding upper bounds
on $R(P, Q_n)$ using a duality between copies of $Q_n$ and sets of elements
that cover them, referred to as blockers. We prove several properties of
blockers and their direct relation to the Ramsey numbers. Using these
properties we show that $R(\mathcal{N},Q_n)=n+\Theta(n/\log n)$, for a poset
$\mathcal{N}$ with four elements $A, B, C, $ and $D$, such that $A<C$, $B<D$,
$B<C$, and the remaining pairs of elements are incomparable.

  Learning for Objects with Different Geometric Features",,,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robotic force-based compliance control is a preferred approach to achieve
high-precision assembly tasks. When the geometric features of assembly objects
are asymmetric or irregular, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are gradually
incorporated into the compliance controller to adapt to complex force-pose
mapping which is hard to model analytically. Since force-pose mapping is
strongly dependent on geometric features, a compliance controller is only
optimal for current geometric features. To reduce the learning cost of assembly
objects with different geometric features, this paper is devoted to answering
how to reconfigure existing controllers for new assembly objects with different
geometric features. In this paper, model-based parameters are first
reconfigured based on the proposed Equivalent Theory of Compliance Law (ETCL).
Then the RL agent is transferred based on the proposed Weighted Dimensional
Policy Distillation (WDPD) method. The experiment results demonstrate that the
control reconfiguration method costs less time and achieves better control
performance, which confirms the validity of proposed methods.

(1) a novel DiffStyle module, which leverages powerful probabilistic denoising
diffusion models to learn noise-agnostic speaking style features from a teacher
model by knowledge distillation; (2) a VQ-VAE block, which maps the style
features into a controllable quantized latent space for improving the
generalization of style transfer; and (3) a straight-forward but effective
parameter-free text-style alignment module, which enables NoreSpeech to
transfer style to a textual input from a length-mismatched reference utterance.

structures of Bz dimer is reconstructed by using the measured charge

can be resolved from the measured inter-molecular potential V(R) between two Bz
ions, and the structures of Bz dimer agree well with the theoretical
predictions.

  in neutron noise analysis","23 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables",,,,"stat.CO nucl-th stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a fissile material, the inherent multiplicity of neutrons born through
induced fissions leads to correlations in their detection statistics. The
correlations between neutrons can be used to trace back some characteristics of
the fissile material. This technique known as neutron noise analysis has
applications in nuclear safeguards or waste identification. It provides a
non-destructive examination method for an unknown fissile material. This is an
example of an inverse problem where the cause is inferred from observations of
the consequences. However, neutron correlation measurements are often noisy
because of the stochastic nature of the underlying processes. This makes the
resolution of the inverse problem more complex since the measurements are
strongly dependent on the material characteristics. A minor change in the
material properties can lead to very different outputs. Such an inverse problem
is said to be ill-posed. For an ill-posed inverse problem the inverse
uncertainty quantification is crucial. Indeed, seemingly low noise in the data
can lead to strong uncertainties in the estimation of the material properties.
Moreover, the analytical framework commonly used to describe neutron
correlations relies on strong physical assumptions and is thus inherently
biased. This paper addresses dual goals. Firstly, surrogate models are used to
improve neutron correlations predictions and quantify the errors on those
predictions. Then, the inverse uncertainty quantification is performed to
include the impact of measurement error alongside the residual model bias.

weaknesses in deep neural networks. A standard method in adversarial robustness
assumes a framework to defend against samples crafted by minimally perturbing a

Another form of adversarial sample can be crafted via invariance attacks, which
exploit the model underestimating the importance of relevant features. Previous
literature has indicated a tradeoff in defending against both attack types
within a strictly L_p bounded defense. To promote robustness toward both types
of attacks beyond Euclidean distance metrics, we use metric learning to frame
adversarial regularization as an optimal transport problem. Our preliminary
results indicate that regularizing over invariant perturbations in our
framework improves both invariant and sensitivity defense.

estimate the mean vector assuming the proportion of non-zero means is unknown.
We model the mean vector by a one-group global-local shrinkage prior belonging
to a broad class of such priors that includes the horseshoe prior. We address
some questions related to asymptotic properties of the resulting posterior
distribution of the mean vector for the said class priors. We consider two ways
to model the global parameter in this paper. Firstly by considering this as an
unknown fixed parameter and then by an empirical Bayes estimate of it. In the
second approach, we do a hierarchical Bayes treatment by assigning a suitable
non-degenerate prior distribution to it. We first show that for the class of
priors under study, the posterior distribution of the mean vector contracts
around the true parameter at a near minimax rate when the empirical Bayes
approach is used. Next, we prove that in the hierarchical Bayes approach, the
corresponding Bayes estimate attains the minimax risk asymptotically under the
squared error loss function. We also show that the posterior contracts around
the true parameter at a near minimax rate. These results generalize those of
van der Pas et al. (2014) \cite{van2014horseshoe}, (2017)
\cite{van2017adaptive}, proved for the horseshoe prior. We have also studied in
this work the asymptotic Bayes optimality of global-local shrinkage priors
where the number of non-null hypotheses is unknown. Here our target is to
propose some conditions on the prior density of the global parameter such that
the Bayes risk induced by the decision rule attains Optimal Bayes risk, up to
some multiplicative constant. Using our proposed condition, under the

improving the specificity of diagnoses of cardiopulmonary diseases in a

segmentation are trained and evaluated on CXR datasets in which the
radiographic projections are captured predominantly from the adult population.
However, the shape of the lungs is reported to be significantly different
across the developmental stages from infancy to adulthood. This might result in
age-related data domain shifts that would adversely impact lung segmentation
performance when the models trained on the adult population are deployed for
pediatric lung segmentation. In this work, our goal is to (i) analyze the
generalizability of deep adult lung segmentation models to the pediatric
population and (ii) improve performance through a stage-wise, systematic
approach consisting of CXR modality-specific weight initializations, stacked
ensembles, and an ensemble of stacked ensembles. To evaluate segmentation
performance and generalizability, novel evaluation metrics consisting of mean
lung contour distance (MLCD) and average hash score (AHS) are proposed in
addition to the multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), the
intersection of union (IoU), Dice score, 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95), and
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD). Our results showed a significant
improvement (p < 0.05) in cross-domain generalization through our approach.

an approach known as Type-II maximum likelihood (ML-II). However, ML-II does
not account for hyperparameter uncertainty, and it is well-known that this can
lead to severely biased estimates and an underestimation of predictive
uncertainty. While there are several works which employ a fully Bayesian
characterisation of GPs, relatively few propose such approaches for the sparse

regression which leverages MCMC to sample from the hyperparameter posterior
within the variational inducing point framework of Titsias (2009). This work is
closely related to Hensman et al. (2015b) but side-steps the need to sample the
inducing points, thereby significantly improving sampling efficiency in the

that of general domain. To analyze the effect of each contribution, we compare
the performance of entity typing and textual entailment model, and conduct

framework that allows for selective quantization of the modes of a complex
system. In the quantum limit, MQC reproduces the semiclassical Double
Herman-Kluk IVR results, accurately capturing nuclear quantum coherences and
conserving zero-point energy. However, in the classical limit, while MQC mimics
the Husimi-IVR for real-time correlation functions with linear operators, it is
significantly less accurate for non-linear correlation functions with errors
even at time zero. Here, we identify the origin of this discrepancy in the MQC
formulation and propose a modification. We analytically show that the modified
MQC approach is exact for all correlation functions at time zero, and in a
study of zero-point energy (ZPE) flow, we numerically demonstrate that it
correctly obtains the quantum and classical limits as a function of time.
Interestingly, while classical-limit MQC simulations show the expected,
unphysical ZPE leakage, we find it is possible to predict and even modify the
direction of ZPE flow through selective quantization of the system, with the
quantum-limit modes accepting energy additions but preserving the minimum
quantum mechanically required energy.

strong Coulomb repulsion leads to a spontaneous spin and valley symmetry
breaking via Stoner transitions. Using a model that incorporates the
spontaneous spin and valley polarization, we explore the Kohn-Luttinger

find that the strongest superconducting instability is in the $p-$wave channel,

find a range of densities and transverse electric fields where
superconductivity develops out of a strongly corrugated, singly-connected Fermi

interlayer exchange coupling and the intralayer exchange stiffness in synthetic

Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ (5-40 nm)/Ru/ Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ material
platform. The complex interplay between the two exchange interactions results
in a gradient of the magnetization orientation across the thickness of the
stack which alters the hysteresis and the spin wave eigenmodes of the stack in
a non trivial way. We measured the field-dependence of the frequencies of the
first four spin waves confined within the thickness of the stack. We modeled
these frequencies and the corresponding thickness profiles of these spin waves
using micromagnetic simulations. The comparison with the experimental results
allows to deduce the magnetic parameters that best account for the sample
behavior. The exchange stiffness is established to be 16 $\pm$ 2 pJ/m,
independently of the Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$ thickness. The interlayer
exchange coupling starts from -1.7 mJ/m$^2$ for the thinnest layers and it can
be maintained above -1.3 mJ/m$^2$ for CoFeB layers as thick as 40 nm. The
comparison of our method with earlier characterizations using the sole

tool for solving machine learning problems on graphs. Most GNNs are members of

connection between these models and the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test of
isomorphism, an algorithm that can successfully test isomorphism for a broad
class of graphs. Recently, much research has focused on measuring the
expressive power of GNNs. For instance, it has been shown that standard MPNNs
are at most as powerful as WL in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs.
However, these studies have largely ignored the distances between the
representations of nodes/graphs which are of paramount importance for learning
tasks. In this paper, we define a distance function between nodes which is
based on the hierarchy produced by the WL algorithm, and propose a model that
learns representations which preserve those distances between nodes. Since the
emerging hierarchy corresponds to a tree, to learn these representations, we
capitalize on recent advances in the field of hyperbolic neural networks. We
empirically evaluate the proposed model on standard node and graph

rare. Several such emission lines have recently been discovered in one example
case, those from NaCl and KCl salt molecules. We studied a sample of 23
candidate high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) in 17 high-mass star-forming
regions to determine how frequently emission from these species is detected. We
present five new detections of water, NaCl, KCl, PN, and SiS from the innermost
regions around the objects, bringing the total number of known briny disk
candidates to nine. Their kinematic structure is generally disk-like, though we
are unable to determine whether they arise from a disk or outflow in the
sources with new detections. We demonstrate that these species are spatially
coincident in a few resolved cases and show that they are generally detected

several disks around HMYSOs clearly do not exhibit emission in these species.
Salty disks are therefore neither particularly rare in high-mass disks, nor are
they ubiquitous.

copulas standard uniform convergence implies weak convergence of almost all

we prove that an Archimedean copula is singular if, and only if, almost all

applied to conditional Archimedean copulas which are reintroduced largely from
a Markov kernel perspective and it is shown that convergence, singularity and
conditional increasingness carry over from Archimedean copulas to their

estimating (the generator of) an Archimedean copula directly yields an
estimator of (the generator of) its conditional copula. Building upon that, we
sketch the use and estimation of a conditional version of a recently introduced

Disciplines such as computer vision and computational biology have benefited
significantly from such methodological advances, which has led to breakthroughs
in scientific domains such as protein structure prediction and design. In this
work, we introduce GCPNet, a new geometry-complete, SE(3)-equivariant graph
neural network designed for 3D molecular graph representation learning.
Rigorous experiments across four distinct geometric tasks demonstrate that
GCPNet's predictions (1) for protein-ligand binding affinity achieve a
statistically significant correlation of 0.608, more than 5% greater than
current state-of-the-art methods; (2) for protein structure ranking achieve
statistically significant target-local and dataset-global correlations of 0.616
and 0.871, respectively; (3) for Newtownian many-body systems modeling achieve
a task-averaged mean squared error less than 0.01, more than 15% better than
current methods; and (4) for molecular chirality recognition achieve a
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy of 98.7%, better than any other machine
learning method to date. The source code, data, and instructions to train new

$\mathcal{DM}^A_{\acute{e}t,c}(S,\mathbb{Z})$ of constructible Artin \'etale

  When the scheme $S$ is regular, we exhibit a subcategory of smooth Artin
motives which can be related to local systems and to representations of the
\'etale fundamental group.
  When the scheme $S$ allows resolution of singularities, we construct the
ordinary motivic t-structure.
  When the scheme $S$ is of dimension $2$ or less we construct the perverse
motivic t-structure and prove an analog of the Affine Lefschetz Theorem. We
show that the perverse motivic t-structure cannot exist on
$\mathcal{DM}^A_{\acute{e}t,c}(\mathbb{A}^4_k,\mathbb{Z})$ with $k$ a field.
  We construct the perverse homotopy t-structure on
$\mathcal{DM}^A_{\acute{e}t,c}(S,\mathbb{Q})$ which is the best possible
approximation of the perverse motivic t-structure. When $S$ is of finite type
over $\mathbb{F}_p$, the $\ell$-adic realization functor is t-exact when we
restrict its target to the category of Artin $\ell$-adic sheaves endowed with
its perverse homotopy t-structure.
  When $S$ is $1$-dimensional, we describe the category of perverse Artin
\'etale motives $\mathrm{M}^A_{\mathrm{perv}}(S,\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of
representations of \'etale fundamental groups of regular locally closed
subschemes of $S$. We also describe the $\ell$-adic realization in this case.
Finally, the category $\mathrm{M}^A_{\mathrm{perv}}(S,\mathbb{Q})$ is similar
to the category of perverse sheaves: its objects are of finite length and we
can describe its simple objects. For instance, the motivic weightless
intersection complex $\mathbb{E}_S$ of Ayoub and Zucker is a simple Artin
perverse sheaf.

gain by generating speech signals from compact speech features. This paper
introduces additional coding efficiency in neural speech coding by reducing the
temporal redundancy existing in the frame-level feature sequence via a
recurrent neural predictor. The prediction can achieve a low-entropy residual
representation, which we discriminatively code based on their contribution to
the signal reconstruction. The harmonization of feature prediction and
discriminative coding results in a dynamic bit allocation algorithm that spends
more bits on unpredictable but rare events. As a result, we develop a scalable,
lightweight, low-latency, and low-bitrate neural speech coding system. We
demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods using the LPCNet as a neural
vocoder. While the proposed method guarantees causality in its prediction, the
subjective tests and feature space analysis show that our model achieves
superior coding efficiency compared to LPCNet and Lyra V2 in the very low

time). In this work, we aim at studying the star formation history (SFH) of the
GOODS-ALMA galaxies to understand if the so-called ``starburst (SB) in the MS''
galaxies exhibit a different star formation activity over the last Gyr compared
to MS galaxies that could explain their specificity. We use the CIGALE SED
modelling code to which we add non-parametric SFHs. To compare quantitatively
the recent SFH of the galaxies, we define a parameter, the star formation rate
(SFR) gradient that provides the angle showing the direction that a galaxy has
followed in the SFR vs stellar mass plane over a given period. We show that
``SB in the MS'' have positive or weak negative gradients over the last 100,
300, and 1000 Myr, at odds with a scenario where these galaxies would be
transitioning from the SB region at the end of a strong starburst phase. Normal
GOODS-ALMA galaxies and ``SB in the MS'' have the same SFR gradients
distributions meaning that they have similar recent SFH, despite their
different properties (compactness, low depletion time). The ``SBs in the MS''
manage to maintain a star-formation activity allowing them to stay within the
MS. This points toward a diversity of galaxies within a complex MS.

particularly suited if the multidimensional driver is given by a L\'evy copula.
The multilevel version of the algorithm requires a new coupling of the
approximate L\'evy drivers in the consecutive levels of the scheme, which is
defined via a coupling of the corresponding Poisson point processes. The
multilevel scheme is weak in the sense that the bound on the level variances is
based on the coupling alone without requiring strong convergence. Moreover, the

stringent ultra short-range assumption on the symmetry-allowed interactions,
predicts a phase diagram with distinct regions of spin-polarized, canted
antiferromagnetic, inter-valley coherent, and charge density wave order. While
early experiments suggested that the system was in the canted antiferromagnetic

experiments, we present the complete phase diagram of $\nu=0$ graphene in the
Hartree-Fock approximation, using generic symmetry-allowed interactions,

Allowing for a sublattice potential (valley Zeeman coupling), we find numerous

than unity, the probability distribution function of the logarithm of
transmission, P(ln T) is Gaussian with average value -s and variance 2s. Here
we show in numerical simulations and optical measurements that in random binary
systems, and most prominently in systems for which s less than unity, the
statistics of transmission are universal for transmission near an upper cutoff
of unity and depend upon the character of the discrete disorder near a lower
cutoff. The universal behavior of P(ln T) closely resembles a segment of a
Gaussian and arises in random binary media with as few as three binary layers.
Above the lower cutoff, but below the crossover to a universal expression, the
shape of P(ln T) also depends upon the reflectivity of the interface between
the layers. For a given value of s, P(ln T) evolves towards a universal
distribution given by random matrix theory in the dense weak scattering limit
as the numbers of layers increases. P(ln T) found in simulations is compared to
results of random matrix calculations in the dense weak scattering limit but

measurements and localization. Both these effects lead to pinning of the
quantum mechanical wavefunction resulting in suppression of entanglement in the
steady state. In monitored free-fermionic models the steady state undergoes an
entanglement transition from a critical logarithmically to area-law entangled
steady state due to the coupling to an environment. However, in an isolated
system arbitrarily weak disorder in one dimension leads to Anderson
localization. We investigate a free-fermion system in a random field subject to
continuous monitoring, which enables us to probe the non-trivial interplay
between measurement-induced phases and disorder. Through the careful analysis
of the effective central charge, entanglement entropy, and density-density
correlations, we show that the critical phase with conformal symmetry is stable
under disorder perturbations until a finite critical disorder strength. We find
that the universality class of the transition at finite disorder and
dissipative coupling is consistent with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
across the extended phase diagram. Furthermore, destructive interference
responsible for Anderson localization is destroyed under finite monitoring
strength and the steady state orbital wavefunction exhibits a power-law decay.
Our results indicate that critical phase is robust to disorder and the area-law
phase is distinct from Anderson localization at weak dissipation. Our work
opens the avenue to probe this interesting phase transition in experiments
involving electrons in quantum dot arrays and nanowires, and allow quantum

self-adaptation. ML has been used to deal with several problems in
self-adaptation, such as maintaining an up-to-date runtime model under
uncertainty and scalable decision-making. Yet, exploiting ML comes with
inherent challenges. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important
challenge for learning-based self-adaptive systems: drift in adaptation spaces.
With adaptation space we refer to the set of adaptation options a self-adaptive
system can select from at a given time to adapt based on the estimated quality
properties of the adaptation options. Drift of adaptation spaces originates
from uncertainties, affecting the quality properties of the adaptation options.
Such drift may imply that eventually no adaptation option can satisfy the
initial set of the adaptation goals, deteriorating the quality of the system,
or adaptation options may emerge that allow enhancing the adaptation goals. In
ML, such shift corresponds to novel class appearance, a type of concept drift
in target data that common ML techniques have problems dealing with. To tackle
this problem, we present a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances
learning-based self-adaptive systems with a lifelong ML layer. We refer to this
approach as lifelong self-adaptation. The lifelong ML layer tracks the system
and its environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks,
identifies new tasks based on differences, and updates the learning models of
the self-adaptive system accordingly. A human stakeholder may be involved to
support the learning process and adjust the learning and goal models. We
present a general architecture for lifelong self-adaptation and apply it to the
case of drift of adaptation spaces that affects the decision-making in
self-adaptation. We validate the approach for a series of scenarios using the

magnetic field $H_{c}$ was fully consistent with the view on the RTSC that its
lattice unit -- a metal island -- is filled with the Slater's atoms. Each
Slater's atom has the expanded diameter of 14.5 nm in order to have perfect
diamagnetism with the magnitude corresponding to a single flux quantum
$\phi_{0}$. Its expanded orbit is associated with the fine structure constant
$\alpha \approx \frac{1}{137}$. In this paper, another important critical value
-- the critical current $I_{c}$ -- is reported. It was found that the
supercurrent has achieved the ultimate speed of matter, i.e., the speed of
light, $c$. Beginning with a warm-up exercise for the Bohr's atom, how the
Slater's atom is formed and why the $c$ appears are shown. These considerations
lead to a simple view on the pairing mechanism of superconductivity, which also

relevant to the interpretation of quantum mechanics and emulating well-known
quantum gauge theories, such as scalar electrodynamics (Klein-Gordon-Maxwell
electrodynamics), spinor electrodynamics (Dirac-Maxwell electrodynamics), etc.
In these models, evolution is typically described by modified Maxwell
equations. In the case of scalar electrodynamics, the scalar complex wave
function can be made real by a gauge transformation, the wave function can be
algebraically eliminated from the equations of scalar electrodynamics, and the
resulting modified Maxwell equations describe the independent evolution of the
electromagnetic field. Similar results were obtained for spinor
electrodynamics. Three out of four components of the Dirac spinor can be
algebraically eliminated from the Dirac equation, and the remaining component
can be made real by a gauge transformation. A similar result was obtained for
the Dirac equation in the Yang-Mills field. As quantum gauge theories play a
central role in modern physics, the approach of this article may be
sufficiently general. One-particle wave functions can be modeled as plasma-like
collections of a large number of particles and antiparticles. This seems to
enable the simulation of quantum phase-space distribution functions, such as
the Wigner distribution function, which are not necessarily non-negative.

program that Buchdahl originated but prematurely abandoned circa 1962 (Nuovo
Cimento 23, 141 (1962)). Therein we obtained an exhaustive class of metrics
that constitute the branch of non-trivial solutions to the pure $R^{2}$ field
equation in vacuo. The Buchdahl-inspired metrics in general possess
non-constant scalar curvature, thereby defeating the generalized Lichnerowicz
theorem previously advocated for quadratic gravity. We found that the said
theorem makes an overly strong assumption on the asymptotic falloff in the
spatial derivatives of the Ricci scalar, rendering it violable against the
Buchdahl-inspired metrics. In this paper, we shall further extend our work
mentioned above by showing that, within the class of Buchdahl-inspired metrics,
the asymptotically flat member takes on an exact closed analytical expression.
The new metric is characterized by a horizon radius $r_{\text{s}}$ and the
Buchdahl parameter $k$, the latter of which arises via the higher-derivative
nature of $R^{2}$ gravity. For $k=0$, the new metric recovers the classic
Schwarzschild metric. Equipped with the exact expression of the new metric, we
shall analytically construct the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram for pure $R^{2}$
spacetime. We find that the Buchdahl parameter $k$ fundamentally modifies the
properties of $R^{2}$ spacetime structures in a variety of ways.

longstanding challenge. Prevailing animal reconstruction methods often adopt a
control-point driven animation model and optimize bone transforms individually

articulation. In contrast, humans can easily infer the articulation structure
of an unknown animal by associating it with a seen articulated character in
their memory. Inspired by this fact, we present CASA, a novel Category-Agnostic
Skeletal Animal reconstruction method consisting of two major components: a
video-to-shape retrieval process and a neural inverse graphics framework.
During inference, CASA first retrieves an articulated shape from a 3D character
assets bank so that the input video scores highly with the rendered image,
according to a pretrained language-vision model. CASA then integrates the
retrieved character into an inverse graphics framework and jointly infers the
shape deformation, skeleton structure, and skinning weights through
optimization. Experiments validate the efficacy of CASA regarding shape
reconstruction and articulation. We further demonstrate that the resulting
skeletal-animated characters can be used for re-animation.

social media technology. There has been a significant social and psychological
impact on the population due to the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the current events being discussed on social
media platforms. In order to safeguard societies from this pandemic, studying
people's emotions on social media is crucial. As a result of their particular
characteristics, sentiment analysis of texts like tweets remains challenging.
Sentiment analysis is a powerful text analysis tool. It automatically detects
and analyzes opinions and emotions from unstructured data. Texts from a wide
range of sources are examined by a sentiment analysis tool, which extracts
meaning from them, including emails, surveys, reviews, social media posts, and
web articles. To evaluate sentiments, natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning techniques are used, which assign weights to entities, topics,
themes, and categories in sentences or phrases. Machine learning tools learn
how to detect sentiment without human intervention by examining examples of
emotions in text. In a pandemic situation, analyzing social media texts to
uncover sentimental trends can be very helpful in gaining a better
understanding of society's needs and predicting future trends. We intend to
study society's perception of the COVID-19 pandemic through social media using
state-of-the-art BERT and Deep CNN models. The superiority of BERT models over
other deep models in sentiment analysis is evident and can be concluded from

network (BSEN) that integrates regularly adminstrated psychological tests
information into the encoding procedure of representing subject's restingstate
fMRI data for automatic classification tasks. BSEN is based on a 3D
convolutional autoencoder structure with contrastive loss jointly optimized
using behavior scores from MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR). Our proposed classification framework of using BSEN
achieved an overall recognition accuracy of 59.44% (3-class classification: AD,
MCI and Healthy Control), and we further extracted the most discriminative
regions between healthy control (HC) and AD patients.

concentrated on the task of narrowband signal classification after the signals
of interest have already been detected and extracted from a wideband capture.
To encourage broader research with wideband operations, we introduce the
WidebandSig53 (WBSig53) dataset which consists of 550 thousand
synthetically-generated samples from 53 different signal classes containing
approximately 2 million unique signals. We extend the TorchSig signal
processing machine learning toolkit for open-source and customizable
generation, augmentation, and processing of the WBSig53 dataset. We conduct
experiments using state of the art (SoTA) convolutional neural networks and
transformers with the WBSig53 dataset. We investigate the performance of signal
detection tasks, i.e. detect the presence, time, and frequency of all signals
present in the input data, as well as the performance of signal recognition
tasks, where networks detect the presence, time, frequency, and modulation
family of all signals present in the input data. Two main approaches to these
tasks are evaluated with segmentation networks and object detection networks
operating on complex input spectrograms. Finally, we conduct comparative
analysis of the various approaches in terms of the networks' mean average
precision, mean average recall, and the speed of inference.

monitoring technology, seismic ambient noise provides precious information
about the structural behavior of old buildings. The measurement of the
vibrations produced by anthropic and environmental sources and their use for
dynamic identification and structural health monitoring of buildings initiated
an emerging, cross-disciplinary field engaging seismologists, engineers,
mathematicians, and computer scientists. In this work, we employ recent deep
learning techniques for time-series forecasting to inspect and detect anomalies
in the large dataset recorded during a long-term monitoring campaign conducted
on the San Frediano bell tower in Lucca. We frame the problem as an
unsupervised anomaly detection task and train a Temporal Fusion Transformer to
learn the normal dynamics of the structure. We then detect the anomalies by
looking at the differences between the predicted and observed frequencies.

multi-occupancy environments based on proximity interaction. Current
proximity-based and indoor location methods allow the estimation of the
positions or areas where inhabitants carry out their daily human activities.
The spatial-temporal relation between location and sensor activations is
described in this work to generate a sensor interaction matrix for each
inhabitant. This enables the use of classical HAR models to reduce the
complexity of the multi-occupancy problem. A case study deployed with UWB and
binary sensors is presented.

has its own meaning as it starts something while showing a will, a new
possibility to create, to meet and to surprise. The event is in fact an ""advent
that reaches everything"" generally integrating itself into a long process or
phase of the evolution of societies in terms of its societal structure.
However, if the event exists, it is significant and therefore assessable. How
to evaluate an Olympic Games or an international exhibition? Can we evaluate
the before (from the statement of position, application file), the during (the
course of the tourist, cultural or sporting event) and the after (the closing
of the festival and its direct and indirect effects on society)? How then to
evaluate all the dimensions of the event generally based on major tourist and
urban planning operations? We will take as a field of study a city -- capital
-- commercial port which has become a sort of archetype in the context of the
organization of mega-events with a tourist vocation, such as the Universal or
International Exhibitions and the Olympic Games, namely Barcelona and three
very important dates for the Catalan capital: 1888, universal exhibition, 1929
universal and international exhibition, 1992 the modern Olympic Games and 2004
the Universal Forum of Cultures of Unesco, international exhibition. The
economic interest of organizing an ephemeral giant event is still relevant and
will be confirmed in the future with the role of Asian countries within the IOC
and the BIE (Bureau international des expositions). The important thing is to
develop a rational argument to communicate on the economic merits of the event.
Sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are
predominant elements for ephemeral events that are intended to be sustainable
over time for future generations.
