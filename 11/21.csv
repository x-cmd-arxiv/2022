  Metric",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Combining the Color and Event cameras (also called Dynamic Vision Sensors,
DVS) for robust object tracking is a newly emerging research topic in recent
years. Existing color-event tracking framework usually contains multiple
scattered modules which may lead to low efficiency and high computational
complexity, including feature extraction, fusion, matching, interactive
learning, etc. In this paper, we propose a single-stage backbone network for
Color-Event Unified Tracking (CEUTrack), which achieves the above functions
simultaneously. Given the event points and RGB frames, we first transform the
points into voxels and crop the template and search regions for both
modalities, respectively. Then, these regions are projected into tokens and
parallelly fed into the unified Transformer backbone network. The output
features will be fed into a tracking head for target object localization. Our
proposed CEUTrack is simple, effective, and efficient, which achieves over 75
FPS and new SOTA performance. To better validate the effectiveness of our model
and address the data deficiency of this task, we also propose a generic and
large-scale benchmark dataset for color-event tracking, termed COESOT, which
contains 90 categories and 1354 video sequences. Additionally, a new evaluation
metric named BOC is proposed in our evaluation toolkit to evaluate the
prominence with respect to the baseline methods. We hope the newly proposed
method, dataset, and evaluation metric provide a better platform for
color-event-based tracking. The dataset, toolkit, and source code will be
released on: \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/COESOT}.

quantum system. A lack of precision is often quantified by gate-error metrics,
such as the average infidelity or the diamond distance. However, usually such
gate-error metrics are only considered for individual gates, and not the errors
that accumulate over consecutive gates. Furthermore, it is not well known how
susceptible the metrics are to the assumptions which make up the model. Here,
we investigate these issues using realistic simulation models of quantum
computers with flux-tunable transmons and coupling resonators. We show that the
gate-error metrics are susceptible to many of the assumptions which make up the
model. Additionally, we find that consecutive gate errors do not accumulate
linearly. Previous work showed that the gate-error metrics are poor predictors
for the performance of consecutive gates. Here, we provide further evidence and
a concise theoretical explanation for this finding. Furthermore, we discuss a
problem that potentially limits the overall scaling capabilities of the device
architecture we study in this work.

Currently, the NPP operates a lot of power transformers with extended service
life, which exceeds the designated 25 years. Due to the extension of the
service life, the task of monitoring the technical condition of power
transformers becomes urgent. An important method for monitoring power
transformers is Chromatographic Analysis of Dissolved Gas. It is based on the
principle of controlling the concentration of gases dissolved in transformer
oil. The appearance of almost any type of defect in equipment is accompanied by
the formation of gases that dissolve in oil, and specific types of defects
generate their gases in different quantities. At present, at NPPs, the
monitoring systems for transformer equipment use predefined control limits for
the concentration of dissolved gases in the oil. This study describes the
stages of developing an algorithm to detect defects and faults in transformers
automatically using machine learning and data analysis methods. Among machine
learning models, we trained Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks. The best of them were then combined into an
ensemble (StackingClassifier) showing F1-score of 0.974 on a test sample. To
develop mathematical models, we used data on the state of transformers,

the accuracy of the student model with the reduced-precision weight parameters.
However, little is understood about which of the various KD approaches best
fits the QAT of Transformers. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of
the mechanism of KD on attention recovery of quantized large Transformers. In
particular, we reveal that the previously adopted MSE loss on the attention
score is insufficient for recovering the self-attention information. Therefore,
we propose two KD methods; attention-map and attention-output losses.
Furthermore, we explore the unification of both losses to address
task-dependent preference between attention-map and output losses. The
experimental results on various Transformer encoder models demonstrate that the
proposed KD methods achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for QAT with sub-2-bit

transmitter is restricted to an average and a peak molecule release rate
constraint. Such a channel serves as a model for diffusive MC systems featuring
long channel impulse responses and employing molecule counting receivers. We
derive lower and upper bounds on the DI capacity of the DTPC with ISI when the
number of ISI channel taps $K$ may grow with the codeword length $n$ (e.g., due
to increasing symbol rate). As a key finding, we establish that for
deterministic encoding, the codebook size scales as $2^{(n\log n)R}$ assuming
that the number of ISI channel taps scales as $K = 2^{\kappa \log n}$, where
$R$ is the coding rate and $\kappa$ is the ISI rate. Moreover, we show that
optimizing $\kappa$ leads to an effective identification rate [bits/s] that
scales linearly with $n$, which is in contrast to the typical transmission rate

we introduce General Retrieval Adaptors for Continual Editing, or GRACE, which
learns to cache a chosen layer's activations in an adaptive codebook as edits
stream in, leaving original model weights frozen. GRACE can thus edit models

problem space scales up, and the $complexity$ of concepts becomes diverse.
Specifically, at the $representational \ level$, we seek to answer how the
complexity varies when a visual concept is mapped to the representation space.
Prior psychology literature has shown that two types of complexities (i.e.,
subjective complexity and visual complexity) (Griffiths and Tenenbaum, 2003)
build an inverted-U relation (Donderi, 2006; Sun and Firestone, 2021).
Leveraging Representativeness of Attribute (RoA), we computationally confirm
the following observation: Models use attributes with high RoA to describe
visual concepts, and the description length falls in an inverted-U relation
with the increment in visual complexity. At the $computational \ level$, we aim
to answer how the complexity of representation affects the shift between the
rule- and similarity-based generalization. We hypothesize that
category-conditioned visual modeling estimates the co-occurrence frequency
between visual and categorical attributes, thus potentially serving as the
prior for the natural visual world. Experimental results show that
representations with relatively high subjective complexity outperform those
with relatively low subjective complexity in the rule-based generalization,

uncertain energy transition to explore critical and non-linear governance
questions, from leveraged transitions to reserve replacements. Adversarial play
facilitated by state-of-the-art algorithms revealed decision-making strategies
robust to energy transition uncertainty and against multiple IOCs. In all

sense that it only incorporates the self-interactions predicted by General
Relativity in single-clock models (additional interaction channels should only

at GUT scale decoherence is incomplete only for the scales crossing out the

an input and generates a natural language sentence as its explanation.
Subsequently, we leverage the generated explanation for various natural

  approximations","30 pages, 10 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Latent Gaussian models (LGMs) are perhaps the most commonly used class of
models in statistical applications. Nevertheless, in areas ranging from
longitudinal studies in biostatistics to geostatistics, it is easy to find
datasets that contain inherently non-Gaussian features, such as sudden jumps or
spikes, that adversely affect the inferences and predictions made from an LGM.
These datasets require more general latent non-Gaussian models (LnGMs) that can
handle these non-Gaussian features automatically. However, fast implementation
and easy-to-use software are lacking, which prevent LnGMs from becoming widely
applicable. In this paper, we derive variational Bayes algorithms for fast and
scalable inference of LnGMs. The approximation leads to an LGM that downweights
extreme events in the latent process, reducing their impact and leading to more
robust inferences. It can be applied to a wide range of models, such as
autoregressive processes for time series, simultaneous autoregressive models
for areal data, and spatial Mat\'ern models. To facilitate Bayesian inference,
we introduce the ngvb package, where LGMs implemented in R-INLA can be easily
extended to LnGMs by adding a single line of code.

interpretation of the functions learned by them. To this end, we study the
training problem of attention/transformer networks and introduce a novel convex
analytic approach to improve the understanding and optimization of these

self-attention mechanism and reformulate the regularized training problem of
transformer networks with our alternative convex attention. Then, we cast the
reformulation as a convex optimization problem that is interpretable and easier
to optimize. Moreover, as a byproduct of our convex analysis, we reveal an
implicit regularization mechanism, which promotes sparsity across tokens.
Therefore, we not only improve the optimization of attention/transformer

measured by the MESSENGER mission and the radial dependences of the electron
peak intensity and the peak-intensity energy spectrum. The analysis comprises
the period from 2010 to 2015, when MESSENGER heliocentric distance varied

list of 12 SEE events measured in February and March 2022 by spacecraft near 1
au and by Solar Orbiter around its first close perihelion at 0.32 au.
  Results: Due to the elevated background intensity level of the particle
instrument on board MESSENGER, the SEE events measured by this mission are
necessarily large and intense; most of them accompanied by a CME-driven shock,
being widespread in heliolongitude, and displaying relativistic ($\sim$1 MeV)
electron intensity enhancements. The two main conclusions derived from the
analysis of the large SEE events measured by MESSENGER, which are generally
supported by Solar Orbiter's data results, are: (1) There is a wide variability
in the radial dependence of the electron peak intensity between $\sim$0.3 au
and $\sim$1 au, but the peak intensities of the energetic electrons decrease
with radial distance from the Sun in 27 out of 28 events. On average and within
the uncertainties, we find a radial dependence consistent with $R^{-3}$. (2)
The electron spectral index found in the energy range around 200 keV
($\delta$200) of the backward-scattered population near 0.3 au measured by
MESSENGER is harder in 19 out of 20 (15 out of 18) events by a median factor of
$\sim$20% ($\sim$10%) when comparing to the anti-sunward propagating beam
(backward-scattered population) near 1 au.

representing cold quark matter to be stiff at intermediate baryonic densities
and soft at high-$n_B$. Here, I suggest that the three flavor NJL model with a
density dependent repulsive coupling, $G_V(\mu)$, can generate an EoS which
interpolates between these two regimes. Such an interpolation requires
repulsion to start decreasing with the chemical potential just after chiral
transition takes place. The conjecture behind this mechanism is that repulsion
should be necessary only as long as the quark condensates, which dress the
effective masses, have non-vanishing values. This assumption guarantees that an
initially hard EoS suffers a conspicuous change of slope at ${\cal E} \simeq
0.7 \,{\rm GeV fm^{-3}}$ converging to the pQCD results at higher energy
densities. Then, the speed of sound naturally reaches a non-conformal maximum
at $n_B = 3.23 \, n_0 = 0.52 \, {\rm fm}^{-3}$ while the trace anomaly remains
positive for all densities, in agreement with recent investigations. These
non-trivial results {\it cannot} be simultaneously obtained when $G_V$ vanishes
or has a fixed value. Therefore, the simple model proposed here is able to link
the (non-perturbative) region of intermediate densities to the region where
pQCD becomes reliable.

on the energy spectrum of the anisotropic quantum Rabi model (QRM) which is the
fundamental model of light-matter interactions with indispensable
counter-rotating terms in ultra-strong couplings. Besides conventional
topological transitions (TTs) at gap closing, abundant unconventional TTs
including a particular one universal for different energy levels are unveiled
underlying level anticrossings without gap closing by tracking the
wave-function nodes. On the other hand, it is found that the nodes have a
correspondence to spin windings, which not only endows the nodes a more
explicit topological character in supporting single-qubit TTs but also turns
the topological information physically detectable. Furthermore, hidden
small-spin-knot transitions are exposed for the ground state, while more kinds
of spin-knot transitions emerge in excited states including unmatched node
numbers and spin winding numbers. As a surprise, frequently the spin windings
produce portraits in high spiritual similarity with abstract artistic works,
which demonstrates that the anisotropic QRM may be the Picasso of physical
models. This signifies that art is joining the dialogue between mathematics and
physics which was triggered by the milestone work of revealing integrability of
the QRM.

networks (DNNs). We adopt the overparameterization perspective -- featuring
interpolation of the training data (i.e., approximately zero train error) and
the double descent phenomenon -- to explain the delicate effect of the transfer
learning setting on generalization performance. We study how the generalization
behavior of transfer learning is affected by the dataset size in the source and
target tasks, the number of transferred layers that are kept frozen in the
target DNN training, and the similarity between the source and target tasks. We
show that the test error evolution during the target DNN training has a more
significant double descent effect when the target training dataset is
sufficiently large with some label noise. In addition, a larger source training
dataset can delay the arrival to interpolation and double descent peak in the
target DNN training. Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of frozen layers
can determine whether the transfer learning is effectively underparameterized
or overparameterized and, in turn, this may affect the relative success or
failure of learning. Specifically, we show that too many frozen layers may make
a transfer from a less related source task better or on par with a transfer
from a more related source task; we call this case overfreezing. We establish
our results using image classification experiments with the residual network
(ResNet) and vision transformer (ViT) architectures.

computer vision. Recent developments in deep learning have pushed the
performance of image OD to new heights by learning-based, data-driven
approaches. On the other hand, video OD remains less explored, mostly due to
much more expensive data annotation needs. At the same time, multi-object
tracking (MOT) which requires reasoning about track identities and
spatio-temporal trajectories, shares similar spirits with video OD. However,
most MOT datasets are class-specific (e.g., person-annotated only), which
constrains a model's flexibility to perform tracking on other objects. We
propose TrIVD (Tracking and Image-Video Detection), the first framework that
unifies image OD, video OD, and MOT within one end-to-end model. To handle the
discrepancies and semantic overlaps across datasets, TrIVD formulates
detection/tracking as grounding and reasons about object categories via
visual-text alignments. The unified formulation enables cross-dataset,
multi-task training, and thus equips TrIVD with the ability to leverage
frame-level features, video-level spatio-temporal relations, as well as track
identity associations. With such joint training, we can now extend the
knowledge from OD data, that comes with much richer object category
annotations, to MOT and achieve zero-shot tracking capability. Experiments
demonstrate that TrIVD achieves state-of-the-art performances across all
image/video OD and MOT tasks.

asymmetric absolutely continuous invariant measures when their expanding rate
is sufficiently small. In a preliminary study, we consider arbitrary maps of
the multi-dimensional torus with permutation symmetries. Using these

the simplex. The subsequent analysis of these reduced maps show that their
systematic dynamics is intractable because some essential features vary with
the number of units; hence the substitutes which nonetheless capture the
coupled maps common characteristics. The construction itself is based on a
simple mechanism for the generation of asymmetric invariant union of polytopes,
whose basic principles should extend to a broad range of maps with permutation

fluctuations that source such patterns are generated by a particular quantum
state -- the Bunch-Davies (BD) state. While this is a well-motivated choice
from a theoretical perspective, the question arises of whether current data can
rule out other, also well motivated, choices of states. In particular, as we
previously demonstrated in arXiv:2104.13410 [hep-th], entanglement is naturally
and inevitably dynamically generated during inflation given the presence of a
""rolling"" spectator scalar field -- and the resulting entangled state will
yield a primordial power spectrum with potentially measurable deviations
compared to the canonical BD result. For this work we developed a perturbative
framework to allow a systematic exploration of constraints on (or detection of)
entangled states with Planck CMB data using Monte Carlo techniques. We have
found that most entangled states accessible with our framework are consistent
with the data. One would have to expand the framework to allow a greater
variety of entangled states in order to saturate the Planck constraints and
more systematically explore any preferences the data may have among the
different possibilities.

nuances of language, culture, and knowledge. Neural networks are capable of
translating between languages -- in some cases even between two languages where
there is little or no access to parallel translations, in what is known as
Unsupervised Machine Translation (UMT). Given this progress, it is intriguing
to ask whether machine learning tools can ultimately enable understanding
animal communication, particularly that of highly intelligent animals. Our work
is motivated by an ambitious interdisciplinary initiative, Project CETI, which
is collecting a large corpus of sperm whale communications for machine
analysis.
  We propose a theoretical framework for analyzing UMT when no parallel data
are available and when it cannot be assumed that the source and target corpora
address related subject domains or posses similar linguistic structure. The
framework requires access to a prior probability distribution that should
assign non-zero probability to possible translations. We instantiate our
framework with two models of language. Our analysis suggests that accuracy of
translation depends on the complexity of the source language and the amount of
``common ground'' between the source language and target prior.
  We also prove upper bounds on the amount of data required from the source
language in the unsupervised setting as a function of the amount of data
required in a hypothetical supervised setting. Surprisingly, our bounds suggest
that the amount of source data required for unsupervised translation is
comparable to the supervised setting. For one of the language models which we
analyze we also prove a nearly matching lower bound.
  Our analysis is purely information-theoretic and as such can inform how much
source data needs to be collected, but does not yield a computationally
efficient procedure.

needs to first detect possible grasps for the objects, decide on the object to
remove and consequently plan and execute a feasible trajectory to retrieve the
chosen object. Over the last years significant progress has been made towards
solving these problems. However, when multiple robot arms are cooperating the
decision and planning problems become exponentially harder. We propose an
integrated multi-arm bin-picking pipeline (IMAPIP), and demonstrate that it is
able to reliably pick objects from a bin in real-time using multiple robot
arms. IMAPIP solves the multi-arm bin-picking task first at high-level using a
geometry-aware policy integrated in a combined task and motion planning
framework. We then plan motions consistent with this policy using the BIT*
algorithm on the motion planning level. We show that this integrated solution
enables robot arm cooperation. In our experiments, we show the proposed
geometry-aware policy outperforms a baseline by increasing bin-picking time by
28\% using two robot arms. The policy is robust to changes in the position of
the bin and number of objects. We also show that IMAPIP to successfully scale
up to four robot arms working in close proximity.

Essentially, we understand the world by understanding entities and relations.
For instance, to understand a field, e.g., computer science, we need to
understand the relevant concepts, e.g., machine learning, and the relationships
between concepts, e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence. To
understand a person, we should first know who he/she is and how he/she is
related to others. To understand entities and relations, humans may refer to
natural language descriptions. For instance, when learning a new scientific
term, people usually start by reading its definition in dictionaries or
encyclopedias. To know the relationship between two entities, humans tend to
create a sentence to connect them. In this paper, we propose [RE]VER: A Unified
Model for Verbalizing Entities and Relations. Specifically, we attempt to build
a system that takes any entity or entity set as input and generates a sentence
to represent entities and relations, named ""natural language representation"".
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can generate high-quality
sentences describing entities and entity relationships and facilitate various
tasks on entities and relations, including definition modeling, relation
modeling, and generative commonsense reasoning.

In other words, we show that pure polynomials are {\em eventually stable}.
Consequently, several eventual stability results available in literature

In addition, we establish the dynamical irreducibility, i.e., the
irreducibility of all iterates, of a subfamily of pure polynomials, namely
Dumas polynomials with respect to a rational prime $p$ under a mild condition
on the degree. This provides iterative techniques to produce irreducible

major challenges in this setting: (1) extrapolation error caused by

way to tackle these problems is to induce conservatism - i.e., keeping the
learned policies closer to the behavioral ones. To achieve this, we build upon
recent works on learning policies in latent action spaces and use a special
form of Normalizing Flows for constructing a generative model, which we use as
a conservative action encoder. This Normalizing Flows action encoder is
pre-trained in a supervised manner on the offline dataset, and then an
additional policy model - controller in the latent space - is trained via
reinforcement learning. This approach avoids querying actions outside of the
training dataset and therefore does not require additional regularization for
out-of-dataset actions. We evaluate our method on various locomotion and
navigation tasks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms recently proposed
algorithms with generative action models on a large portion of datasets.

grids with high renewable penetration levels. The economic benefits and power
grid reliability are both essential for hydrogen storage integration. In this
paper, an annual scheduling model (ASM) for energy hubs (EH) coupled power
grids is proposed to investigate the annual benefits of seasonal hydrogen
storage (SHS). Each energy hub consists of hydrogen storage, electrolyzers, and
fuel cells. The electrical and hydrogen energy can be exchanged on the bus with
the energy hub. The physical constraints for both grids and EHs are enforced in
ASM. The proposed ASM considers the intra-season daily operation of the EH
coupled grids. Four typical daily profiles are used in ASM to represent the
grid conditions in four seasons, which reduces the computational burden.
Besides, both the intra-season and cross-season hydrogen exchange and storage
are modeled in the ASM. Hence, the utilization of hydrogen storage is optimized
on a year-round level. Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 24-bus
system. The simulation results indicate that seasonal hydrogen storage can
effectively save the annual operation cost and reduce renewable curtailments.

post-disaster recovery is essential to inform resource allocation and
prioritization. The current survey-based approaches to examining community
recovery, however, have significant lags and put the burden of data collection
on affected people. Also, the existing literature lacks quantitative measures
for important milestones to inform the assessment of recovery trajectory.
Recognizing these gaps, this study uses location-based data related to
visitation patterns and credit card transactions to specify critical recovery
milestones related to population activity recovery. Using data from 2017
Hurricane Harvey in Harris County (Texas), the study specifies four critical
post-disaster recovery milestones and calculates quantitative measurements of
the length of time between the end of a hazard event and when the spatial areas
(census tracts) reached these milestones based on fluctuations in visits to
essential and non-essential facilities, and essential and non-essential credit
card transactions. Accordingly, an integrated recovery metric is created for an
overall measurement of each spatial area's recovery progression. Exploratory
statistical analyses were conducted to examine whether variations in community
recovery progression in achieving the critical milestones is correlated to its
flood status, socioeconomic characteristics, and demographic composition.
Finally, the extent of spatial inequality is examined. The results show the
presence of moderate spatial inequality in population activity recovery in
Hurricane Harvey, based upon which the inequality of recovery is measured.
Results of this study can benefit post-disaster recovery resource allocation as
well as improve community resilience towards future natural hazards.

Combating this coronavirus infodemic demands effective methods to detect fake
news. To this end, we propose a method to infer news credibility from hashtags
involved in news dissemination on social media, motivated by the tight
connection between hashtags and news credibility observed in our empirical
analyses. We first introduce a new graph that captures all (direct and
\textit{indirect}) relationships among hashtags. Then, a language-independent
semi-supervised algorithm is developed to predict fake news based on this
constructed graph. This study first investigates the indirect relationship
among hashtags; the proposed approach can be extended to any homogeneous graph
to capture a comprehensive relationship among nodes. Language independence
opens the proposed method to multilingual fake news detection. Experiments
conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in identifying fake news, especially at an \textit{early} stage of

we have the existence of a biasymptotic KAM torus. That is a continuous
time-dependent family of embedded tori converging in the future and the past to
suitable quasiperiodic invariant tori.
  In this work, we go one step further. We analyze time-dependent perturbations
of integrable and near-integrable Hamiltonians. Assuming the perturbation
decays polynomially fast in time, we prove the existence of orbit converging to
some quasiperiodic solutions in the future and the past.

the traceability of wood recorded in a public blockchain. Wood is a byproduct
of several states, ranging from standing trees to logs, lumber, and wood
products (hereinafter ``wood objects''). The advantage of using the blockchain
for record keeping is that participants can freely record the information at
their discretion, without any restrictions. However, the openness of the
blockchain may allow a malicious third party to introduce disinformation. In
this study, we employ ZKP and near-field communication (NFC) chips to eliminate
the possibility of disinformation introduction. ZKP is used to prove/validate
changes in the state of wood objects, and the unique nonce associated with that
state is encrypted and recorded on an NFC chip. The nonce is concealed and id
of the wood object is defined as hash value of this nonce. We developed a
prototype system based on an Android application and an Ethereum smart
contract. We confirm that wood traceability and verification can be performed
using the prototype system.

strong gains in performance by matching statistics of deep convolutional neural

  https://github.com/YangLing0818/SGDiff",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating images from graph-structured inputs, such as scene graphs, is
uniquely challenging due to the difficulty of aligning nodes and connections in
graphs with objects and their relations in images. Most existing methods
address this challenge by using scene layouts, which are image-like
representations of scene graphs designed to capture the coarse structures of
scene images. Because scene layouts are manually crafted, the alignment with
images may not be fully optimized, causing suboptimal compliance between the
generated images and the original scene graphs. To tackle this issue, we
propose to learn scene graph embeddings by directly optimizing their alignment
with images. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder to extract both global and
local information from scene graphs that are predictive of the corresponding
images, relying on two loss functions: masked autoencoding loss and contrastive
loss. The former trains embeddings by reconstructing randomly masked image
regions, while the latter trains embeddings to discriminate between compliant
and non-compliant images according to the scene graph. Given these embeddings,
we build a latent diffusion model to generate images from scene graphs. The
resulting method, called SGDiff, allows for the semantic manipulation of
generated images by modifying scene graph nodes and connections. On the Visual
Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, we demonstrate that SGDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, as measured by both the Inception Score and Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) metrics. We will release our source code and trained

analysis problem that is important for many applications involving routing of

traffic patterns to gain some benefit (e.g., make more money by directing

which an adversary removes edges from a graph to make a particular path the
shortest between its terminal nodes. We prove that this problem is APX-hard,
but introduce PATHATTACK, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that
guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In
addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which
the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an

and derive a heuristic algorithm that uses PATHATTACK as a subroutine. We
demonstrate all of these algorithms on a diverse set of real and synthetic

designed CoSF-Net by fully excavating the inherent properties of 4D-MRI, with
consideration of limited and imperfectly matched training datasets. We
conducted extensive experiments on multiple real patient datasets to verify the
feasibility and robustness of the developed network. Compared with existing
networks and three state-of-the-art conventional algorithms, CoSF-Net not only
accurately estimated the deformable vector fields between the respiratory
phases of 4D-MRI but also simultaneously improved the spatial resolution of
4D-MRI with enhanced anatomic features, yielding 4D-MR images with high
spatiotemporal resolution.

MK. In contrast, observations of warmer (around 1 MK) counterparts of FRs are
sparse. In this study, we report the failed eruption of a multi-thermal FR,
hosting both hot and warm plasma. On 2015 May 1, a hot channel appeared in the
AIA high temperature passbands out of the southeastern solar limb to the south
of a nearby flare, and then erupted outward. During the eruption, it rotated
perpendicular to the erupting direction. The hot channel stopped erupting, and
disappeared gradually, showing a failed eruption. During the hot channel
eruption, a warm channel appeared sequentially in the AIA low temperature
passbands. It underwent the similar evolution, including the failed eruption,
rotation, and disappearance, to the hot channel. A bright compression front is
formed in front of the warm channel eruption in AIA low temperature images.
Under the hot and warm channel eruptions, a small flare occurred, upon which
several current sheets, connecting the erupting channels and the underneath
flare, formed in the AIA high temperature passbands. Investigating the spatial
and temporal relation between the hot and warm channels, we suggest that both
channels twist together, constituting the same multi-thermal FR that has plasma

find that the primary mass distribution of hierarchical mergers in AGNs is
higher than that in SCs, with the peaks of $\sim$$50\,M_{\odot}$ and
$\sim$$13\,M_{\odot}$, respectively. The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$)
distribution of hierarchical mergers in SCs is symmetrical around zero as
expected and $\sim$$50\%$ of the mergers have $|\chi_{\rm eff}|>0.2$. The
distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ in AGNs is narrow and prefers positive values
with the peak of $\chi_{\rm eff}\ge0.3$ due to the assistance of AGN disks. BH
hierarchical growth efficiency in AGNs, with at least $\sim$$30\%$ of mergers
being hierarchies, is much higher than the efficiency in SCs. Furthermore,
there are obvious differences in the mass ratios and effective precession

  Unified Vision Language Model",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale Transformer models bring significant improvements for various
downstream vision language tasks with a unified architecture. The performance
improvements come with increasing model size, resulting in slow inference speed
and increased cost for severing. While some certain predictions benefit from
the full complexity of the large-scale model, not all of inputs need the same
amount of computation to conduct, potentially leading to computation resource
waste. To handle this challenge, early exiting is proposed to adaptively
allocate computational power in term of input complexity to improve inference
efficiency. The existing early exiting strategies usually adopt output
confidence based on intermediate layers as a proxy of input complexity to incur
the decision of skipping following layers. However, such strategies cannot
apply to encoder in the widely-used unified architecture with both encoder and
decoder due to difficulty of output confidence estimation in the encoder. It is
suboptimal in term of saving computation power to ignore the early exiting in
encoder component. To handle this challenge, we propose a novel early exiting
strategy for unified visual language models, which allows dynamically skip the
layers in encoder and decoder simultaneously in term of input layer-wise
similarities with multiple times of early exiting, namely \textbf{MuE}. By
decomposing the image and text modalities in the encoder, MuE is flexible and
can skip different layers in term of modalities, advancing the inference
efficiency while minimizing performance drop. Experiments on the SNLI-VE and MS
COCO datasets show that the proposed approach MuE can reduce expected inference
time by up to 50\% and 40\% while maintaining 99\% and 96\% performance
respectively.

However, it may suffer from high redundancy in capturing local features for

utilized, which sacrifice the capacity to capture long-range dependency. A
challenge then arises: can we access efficient and effective global context
modeling at the early stages of a neural network? To address this issue, we
draw inspiration from the design of superpixels, which reduces the number of
image primitives in subsequent processing, and introduce super tokens into
vision transformer. Super tokens attempt to provide a semantically meaningful
tessellation of visual content, thus reducing the token number in
self-attention as well as preserving global modeling. Specifically, we propose
a simple yet strong super token attention (STA) mechanism with three steps: the
first samples super tokens from visual tokens via sparse association learning,
the second performs self-attention on super tokens, and the last maps them back
to the original token space. STA decomposes vanilla global attention into
multiplications of a sparse association map and a low-dimensional attention,
leading to high efficiency in capturing global dependencies. Based on STA, we
develop a hierarchical vision transformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate
its strong performance on various vision tasks. In particular, without any
extra training data or label, it achieves 86.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K

programs require sufficient tuning efforts before being deployed into
production environments. Usually, enormous tensor program candidates need to be
sufficiently explored to find the one with the best performance. This is
necessary to make the neural network products meet the high demand of
real-world applications such as natural language processing, auto-driving, etc.
Auto-schedulers are being developed to avoid the need for human intervention.
However, due to the gigantic search space and lack of intelligent search
guidance, current auto-schedulers require hours to days of tuning time to find
the best-performing tensor program for the entire neural network.
  In this paper, we propose HARL, a reinforcement learning (RL) based
auto-scheduler specifically designed for efficient tensor program exploration.
HARL uses a hierarchical RL architecture in which learning-based decisions are
made at all different levels of search granularity. It also automatically
adjusts exploration configurations in real-time for faster performance
convergence. As a result, HARL improves the tensor operator performance by 22%
and the search speed by 4.3x compared to the state-of-the-art auto-scheduler.
Inference performance and search speed are also significantly improved on
end-to-end neural networks.

shape-texture debiased continual learning. The key idea is to learn

Experiments on six datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach in

be stored as a 3D point cloud with per-point features, consuming several
gigabytes of storage per scene. While compression is possible, performance
drops significantly at high compression rates. Conversely, coordinate
regression methods achieve high compression by storing scene information in a
neural network but suffer from reduced robustness. NeuMap combines the
advantages of both approaches by utilizing 1) learnable latent codes for
efficient scene representation and 2) a scene-agnostic Transformer-based
auto-decoder to infer coordinates for query pixels. This scene-agnostic network
design learns robust matching priors from large-scale data and enables rapid
optimization of codes for new scenes while keeping the network weights fixed.
Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that NeuMap significantly
outperforms other coordinate regression methods and achieves comparable
performance to feature matching methods while requiring a much smaller scene

expressed in local linear format with Jacobian matrix is important to whole

well as a Jacobian matrix estimator in a combination of online and offline way.
The local linear formulation is formulated first. Then, we use a combination of
online and offline method to boost the estimation of the highly coupled and
nonlinear hand-eye relationship with data collected via depth camera. A neural
network (NN) is pre-trained to give a relative reasonable initial estimation of

proposed estimator possesses excellent performance in the accuracy of initial

Jacobian matrix compared with other data-driven estimators. The proposed scheme
acquires the combination of neural network and finite-time control effect which
drives a faster convergence speed compared with the exponentially converge

Laser scanning technology has advanced significantly in terms of mobility and

matured over the years for change detection, clearance measurements and

access to estimates of the relative orientation between neighboring poses, such
that can be obtained via a local alignment method. While self-supervised
learning has been used successfully for translational object keypoints, in this

self-supervised orientation estimation which utilizes Modified Rodrigues
Parameters to stereographically project the closed manifold of $SO(3)$ to the
open manifold of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, allowing the optimization to be done in an
open Euclidean space. We empirically validate the benefits of the proposed

verification problem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem.
As over-approximations inevitably introduce overestimation, many efforts have
been dedicated to defining the tightest possible approximations. Recent studies
have however showed that the existing so-called tightest approximations are
superior to each other. In this paper we identify and report an crucial factor
in defining tight approximations, namely the approximation domains of
activation functions. We observe that existing approaches only rely on
overestimated domains, while the corresponding tight approximation may not
necessarily be tight on its actual domain. We propose a novel
under-approximation-guided approach, called dual-approximation, to define tight
over-approximations and two complementary under-approximation algorithms based
on sampling and gradient descent. The overestimated domain guarantees the
soundness while the underestimated one guides the tightness. We implement our
approach into a tool called DualApp and extensively evaluate it on a

different architectures. The experimental results show that DualApp outperforms

between the language and image modalities to perform finer-grained cross-modal
contrastive learning. We treat each Question-Answer (QA) pair as a whole, and
differentiate between images that conform with it and those against it. To
alleviate the issue of sampling bias, we further build connected graphs among
images. For each positive pair, we regard the images from different graphs as
negative samples and deduct the version of multi-positive contrastive learning.
To our best knowledge, it is the first paper that reveals a general contrastive
learning strategy without delicate hand-craft rules can contribute to robust
VQA reasoning. Experiments on several mainstream VQA datasets demonstrate our
superiority compared to the state of the arts. Code is available at

  Multi-Domain Recommendation","Accepted by WWW 2023 research track. The first two authors
  contributed equally",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Advanced recommender systems usually involve multiple domains (such as
scenarios or categories) for various marketing strategies, and users interact
with them to satisfy diverse demands. The goal of multi-domain recommendation
(MDR) is to improve the recommendation performance of all domains
simultaneously. Conventional graph neural network based methods usually deal
with each domain separately, or train a shared model to serve all domains. The
former fails to leverage users' cross-domain behaviors, making the behavior
sparseness issue a great obstacle. The latter learns shared user representation
with respect to all domains, which neglects users' domain-specific preferences.
In this paper we propose $\mathsf{H^3Trans}$, a hierarchical hypergraph network
based correlative preference transfer framework for MDR, which represents
multi-domain user-item interactions into a unified graph to help preference
transfer. $\mathsf{H^3Trans}$ incorporates two hyperedge-based modules, namely
dynamic item transfer (Hyper-I) and adaptive user aggregation (Hyper-U).
Hyper-I extracts correlative information from multi-domain user-item feedbacks
for eliminating domain discrepancy of item representations. Hyper-U aggregates
users' scattered preferences in multiple domains and further exploits the
high-order (not only pair-wise) connections to improve user representations.
Experiments on both public and production datasets verify the superiority of
$\mathsf{H^3Trans}$ for MDR.

planning for microbeam radiation therapy (MRT). In this paper, we propose a
machine learning (ML) model based on a 3D U-Net. Our approach predicts
separately the large doses of the narrow high intensity synchrotron microbeams
and the lower valley doses between them. For this purpose, a concept of macro
peak doses and macro valley doses is introduced, describing the respective
doses not on a microscopic level but as macroscopic quantities in larger
voxels. The ML model is trained to mimic full Monte Carlo (MC) data. Complex
physical effects such as polarization are therefore automatically taking into
account by the model.
  The macro dose distribution approach described in this study allows for
superimposing single microbeam predictions to a beam array field making it an
interesting candidate for treatment planning. It is shown that the proposed
approach can overcome a main obstacle with microbeam dose predictions by
predicting a full microbeam irradiation field in less than a minute while
maintaining reasonable accuracy.

which incorporates video semantic information and video similarity relationship
understanding in a single stage. To capture video semantic information for
better hashing learning, we adopt an encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct
the video from its temporal-masked frames. Particularly, we find that a higher
masking ratio helps video understanding. Besides, we fully exploit the
similarity relationship between videos by maximizing agreement between two
augmented views of a video, which contributes to more discriminative and robust
hash codes. Extensive experiments on three large-scale video datasets (i.e.,
FCVID, ActivityNet and YFCC) indicate that ConMH achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code is available at https://github.com/huangmozhi9527/ConMH.

distribution can be approximated as an ellipse, which, if it were rotating,
would have its axis oriented south-east to north-west. The most probable
morphology of the emitting regions is interaction between a disc and an
outflow, possibly with a very large opening angle. The arcmin-scale CO outflow
centred on source `B' is oriented East-West, and the methanol masers do show
the highest dispersion of velocity gradients in approximately this direction,
so the kinematics are complex and suggest that more than one source may be
responsible. We also tested kinematic models for a Keplerian disc or a simple
bipolar outflow, but neither are compatible with the kinematics of the maser

broken power-law fit to the 9.0GHz light curve showed that the 5hr flare peaked
at a flux density of 0.4+/-0.1mJy at ~13hr post-burst with a steep rise and
decline. The observed temporal and spectral evolution are not expected in the
standard internal-external shock model, where forward and reverse shock radio
emission evolves on much longer timescales. The early-time (<1day) optical and
X-ray light curves from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory demonstrated typical
afterglow forward shock behaviour, allowing us to use blast wave physics to
determine a likely homogeneous circumburst medium and an emitting electron
population power-law index of p=2.9+/-0.1. We suggest the early-time radio
flare is likely due to weak interstellar scintillation (ISS), which boosted the
radio afterglow emission above the ATCA sensitivity limit on minute timescales.
Using weak ISS relations, we were able to place an upper limit on the size of
the blast wave of $\leq6 \times 10^{16}$cm in the plane of the sky, which is
consistent with the theoretical forward shock size prediction of
$8\times10^{16}$cm for GRB 210702A at ~13h post-burst. This represents the
earliest ISS size constraint on a GRB blast wave to date, demonstrating the
importance of rapid (<1day) radio follow-up of GRBs using several-hour
integrations to capture the early afterglow evolution, and to track
scintillation over a broad frequency range.

challenging task in drug discovery. Previous works usually generate atoms in an
auto-regressive way, where element types and 3D coordinates of atoms are

interactions among atoms in an entire molecule are global, leading to the
energy function pair-coupled among atoms. With such energy-based consideration,
the modeling of probability should be based on joint distributions, rather than
sequentially conditional ones. Thus, the unnatural sequentially auto-regressive
modeling of molecule generation is likely to violate the physical rules, thus
resulting in poor properties of the generated molecules. In this work, a
generative diffusion model for molecular 3D structures based on target proteins
as contextual constraints is established, at a full-atom level in a
non-autoregressive way. Given a designated 3D protein binding site, our model
learns the generative process that denoises both element types and 3D

intelligent systems, and its applications include but are not limited to
autonomous driving, robot navigation, and anomaly detection of monitoring
systems. Due to the diversity of motion behaviors and the complex social
interactions among pedestrians, accurately forecasting the future trajectory of
pedestrians is challenging. Existing approaches commonly adopt GANs or CVAEs to
generate diverse trajectories. However, GAN-based methods do not directly model
data in a latent space, which makes them fail to have full support over the
underlying data distribution; CVAE-based methods optimize a lower bound on the
log-likelihood of observations, causing the learned distribution to deviate
from the underlying distribution. The above limitations make existing
approaches often generate highly biased or unnatural trajectories. In this
paper, we propose a novel generative flow based framework with dual graphormer
for pedestrian trajectory prediction (STGlow). Different from previous
approaches, our method can more accurately model the underlying data
distribution by optimizing the exact log-likelihood of motion behaviors.
Besides, our method has clear physical meanings to simulate the evolution of
human motion behaviors, where the forward process of the flow gradually
degrades the complex motion behavior into a simple behavior, while its reverse
process represents the evolution of a simple behavior to the complex motion
behavior. Further, we introduce a dual graphormer combining with the graph
structure to more adequately model the temporal dependencies and the mutual
spatial interactions. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves much better performance compared to previous
state-of-the-art approaches.

across the system? We employ continuous measurement quantum tomography as a
paradigm to study this question. The measurement record is generated as a
sequence of expectation values of a Hermitian observable evolving under the
repeated application of the Floquet map of the quantum kicked top.
Interestingly, we find that the reconstruction fidelity initially increases
regardless of the degree of chaos or the strength of perturbations in the
dynamics. For random states, when the measurement record is obtained from a
random initial observable, the subsequent drop in the fidelity obtained is
inversely correlated to the degree of chaos in the dynamics. More importantly,
this also gives us an operational interpretation of Loschmidt echo for
operators by connecting it to the performance of quantum tomography. We define
a quantity to capture the scrambling of errors, an out-of-time-ordered
correlator (OTOC) between two operators under perturbed and unperturbed system
dynamics that serves as a signature of chaos and quantifies the spread of
errors. Our results demonstrate not only a fundamental link between Loschmidt
echo and scrambling of errors as captured by OTOCs but that such a link can
have operational consequences in quantum information processing.

  We show that the bubble growth rate increases linearly with the delivered

indicates that they can be used interchangeably for a jet generation. However,
bubbles generated by a CW laser require more optical energy, which is due to

(both paraxial and non-paraxial) at a plane isotropic dielectric interface,
which is azimuthally symmetric in terms of the momentum-spatial variation of
Fresnel coefficients but not in terms of the fundamental polarization

we use the reflection and transmission coefficient matrix formalism to derive
an exact field expression of a normal-reflected diverging beam. The
availability of the exact field information allows controlled variations of the
system parameters, leading to significant dynamics of phase and polarization
singularities hitherto unanticipated in the literature. We carry out a detailed
exploration of these dynamics in our simulated system, and also verify them
experimentally by using an appropriate setup. We then use Barnett's formalism
to determine the associated orbital angular momentum (OAM) fluxes, leading to a
subtle interpretation and mathematical characterization of spin-orbit

unification of the most fundamental electromagnetic reflection/transmission
problem at a plane dielectric interface and the emerging areas of optical
singularity dynamics with their understanding in terms of OAM flux and SOI. The

Inspired by Mask AutoEncoder, we present a simple yet effective Pixel-Level
completion method, Label Mask AutoEncoder(L-MAE), that fully uses the existing
information in the label to predict results. The proposed model adopts the
fusion strategy that stacks the label and the corresponding image, namely Fuse

Fuse Map, direct reconstruction may lead to poor performance. Our proposed
Image Patch Supplement algorithm can supplement the missing information, as the

(FL), and many personalized federated learning methods have been proposed to
handle it. However, the distribution shift between the training dataset and
testing dataset on each client is never considered in FL, despite it being
general in real-world scenarios. We notice that the distribution shift (a.k.a.,
out-of-distribution generalization) problem under Non-IID federated setting
becomes rather challenging due to the entanglement between personalized and
spurious information. To tackle the above problem, we elaborate a general
dual-regularized learning framework to explore the personalized invariance,
compared with the exsiting personalized federated learning methods which are
regularized by a single baseline (usually the global model). Utilizing the
personalized invariant features, the developed personalized models can
efficiently exploit the most relevant information and meanwhile eliminate
spurious information so as to enhance the out-of-distribution generalization
performance for each client. Both the theoretical analysis on convergence and
OOD generalization performance and the results of extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing federated learning

equations are coupled with harmonic means. Firstly, mild conditions of the
existence and uniqueness of the solution to HCRE are induced with collective
observability and primitiviness of weighting matrix. Then, it is proved that
the matrix iterative law of CIDF will converge to the unique solution of the

(LHC) is designed to study p-p and Pb-Pb collisions at ultra-relativistic

charmonia in p-p and heavy ion collisions via their muonic decay. At first, in
the LHC Run 1 and 2 the selection of interesting events for muon physics in the
MS was performed with a dedicated Muon Trigger system based on Resistive Plate
Chambers (RPCs) operated in maxi-avalanche mode. During the Long Shutdown 2
(LS2) of LHC ALICE underwent a major upgrade of its apparatus: since Run 3
(started in July 2022), in order to fully profit from the increased luminosity
of Pb-Pb collisions (from 20 kHz in Run 2 to 50 kHz in Run 3), the ALICE
experiment is running in continuous readout (triggerless) mode and the Muon
Trigger became the Muon IDentifier (MID). In order to reduce the RPC ageing and
to increase the rate capability, it was decided to use a new front-end
electronics FEERIC with a pre-amplification stage to minimize the charge
released per hit inside the gas gap. A description of the MID upgrades,
together with the results and performances of the RPCs from the commissioning,

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial task for ensuring the
reliability and safety of deep learning. Currently, discriminator models
outperform other methods in this regard. However, the feature extraction
process used by discriminator models suffers from the loss of critical
information, leaving room for bad cases and malicious attacks. In this paper,
we introduce a new perceptron bias assumption that suggests discriminator
models are more sensitive to certain features of the input, leading to the
overconfidence problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
that combines discriminator and generation models and integrates diffusion
models (DMs) into OOD detection. We demonstrate that the diffusion denoising
process (DDP) of DMs serves as a novel form of asymmetric interpolation, which
is well-suited to enhance the input and mitigate the overconfidence problem.
The discriminator model features of OOD data exhibit sharp changes under DDP,
and we utilize the norm of this change as the indicator score. Our experiments
on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet show that our method outperforms SOTA
approaches. Notably, for the challenging InD ImageNet and OOD species datasets,
our method achieves an AUROC of 85.7, surpassing the previous SOTA method's
score of 77.4. Our implementation is available at

a psychological perspective, emotions are the expression of affect or feelings

we propose a multimodal sentiment knowledge-sharing framework (UniMSE) that
unifies MSA and ERC tasks from features, labels, and models. We perform
modality fusion at the syntactic and semantic levels and introduce contrastive
learning between modalities and samples to better capture the difference and
consistency between sentiments and emotions. Experiments on four public

Virtual Prototype Lens (VPL) groups through optical simulation, generating
Cityscapes-ab and KITTI-360-ab datasets under different behaviors and levels of

perspective to address the scarcity of labeled aberration data in real-world

(CIADA) to leverage prior knowledge of CI for robust performance in SSOA. Based
on our benchmark, we conduct experiments on the robustness of state-of-the-art

enables robust state estimation of epidemic processes, even in the presence of
uncertain models and noisy measurements. Using the estimated model and state,
we then devise optimal control policies by minimizing a predicted cost

  Survey","This is a preprint of an article submitted to the Journal of Systems

the number of context-aware Internet of Things applications developed
worldwide. Research in context and context-awareness is being conducted to
broaden its applicability in light of many practical and technical challenges.
One of the challenges is improving performance when responding to a large
number of context queries. Context Management Platforms that infer and deliver
context to applications measure this problem using Quality of Service (QoS)
parameters. Although caching is a proven way to improve QoS, transiency of
context and features such as variability and heterogeneity of context queries
pose an additional real-time cost management problem. This paper presents a
critical survey of the state-of-the-art in adaptive data caching with the
objective of developing a body of knowledge in cost- and performance-efficient
adaptive caching strategies. We comprehensively survey a large number of
research publications and evaluate, compare, and contrast different techniques,
policies, approaches, and schemes in adaptive caching. Our critical analysis is
motivated by the focus on adaptively caching context as a core research
problem. A formal definition for adaptive context caching is then proposed,

  2023",,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optimizing functions without access to gradients is the remit of black-box
methods such as evolution strategies. While highly general, their learning
dynamics are often times heuristic and inflexible - exactly the limitations
that meta-learning can address. Hence, we propose to discover effective update
rules for evolution strategies via meta-learning. Concretely, our approach
employs a search strategy parametrized by a self-attention-based architecture,
which guarantees the update rule is invariant to the ordering of the candidate
solutions. We show that meta-evolving this system on a small set of
representative low-dimensional analytic optimization problems is sufficient to
discover new evolution strategies capable of generalizing to unseen
optimization problems, population sizes and optimization horizons. Furthermore,
the same learned evolution strategy can outperform established neuroevolution
baselines on supervised and continuous control tasks. As additional
contributions, we ablate the individual neural network components of our
method; reverse engineer the learned strategy into an explicit heuristic form,
which remains highly competitive; and show that it is possible to
self-referentially train an evolution strategy from scratch, with the learned
update rule used to drive the outer meta-learning loop.

  Learning and All-in-One Classifier","The paper found additional problems",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been highly successful in
transferring knowledge acquired from a label-rich source domain to a
label-scarce target domain. Open-set domain adaptation (ODA) and universal
domain adaptation (UNDA) have been proposed as solutions to the problem
concerning the presence of additional novel categories in the target domain.
Existing ODA and UNDA approaches treat all novel categories as one unified
unknown class and attempt to detect this unknown class during the training
process. We find that domain variance leads to more significant view-noise in
unsupervised data augmentation, affecting the further applications of
contrastive learning~(CL), as well as the current closed-set classifier and
open-set classifier causing the model to be overconfident in novel class
discovery. To address the above two issues, we propose Soft-contrastive
All-in-one Network~(SAN) for ODA and UNDA tasks. SAN includes a novel
data-augmentation-based CL loss, which is used to improve the representational
capability, and a more human-intuitive classifier, which is used to improve the
new class discovery capability. The soft contrastive learning~(SCL) loss is
used to weaken the adverse effects of the data-augmentation label noise
problem, which is amplified in domain transfer. The All-in-One~(AIO) classifier
overcomes the overconfidence problem of the current mainstream closed-set
classifier and open-set classifier in a more human-intuitive way. The
visualization results and ablation experiments demonstrate the importance of
the two proposed innovations. Moreover, extensive experimental results on ODA
and UNDA show that SAN has advantages over the existing state-of-the-art
methods.

cooling technique via collisions with a buffer gas is limited by the
temperature of the used cryogenic cooling medium. Here, we demonstrate forced

cooling of an anionic OH$^{-}$ ensemble from an initial temperature of 370(12)

the ions' phase space density approaching the near-strong Coulomb coupling

phenomenon in the solar corona, its role as a marker of the trigger of eruptive
process remains elusive. Based on the unique decomposition of the magnetic
field into potential and non-potential components, magnetic energy and helicity
can also both be uniquely decomposed into two quantities. Using two 3D MHD
parametric simulations of a configuration that can produce coronal jets, we
compare the dynamics of the magnetic energies and of the relative magnetic
helicities. Both simulations share the same initial set-up and line-tied
bottom-boundary driving profile. However, they differ by the duration of the
forcing. In one simulation the system is driven sufficiently so that an helical
jet is induced. The generation of the jet is however markedly delayed: a
relatively long phase of lower-intensity reconnection takes place before the
jet is eventually induced. In the other reference simulation, the system is
driven during a shorter time, and no jet is produced. As expected, we observe
that the Jet producing simulation contains a higher value of non-potential
energy and non-potential helicity. Focusing on the phase between the end of the
driving-phase and the jet generation, we note that magnetic energies remain
relatively constant, while magnetic helicities have a noticeable evolution.
During this post-driving phase, the ratio of the non-potential to total
magnetic energy very slightly decreases while the helicity eruptivity index
significantly increases. The jet is generated when the system is at the highest
value of this helicity eruptivity index. This proxy critically decreases during
the jet generation phase. The free energy also decreases but does not present
any peak when the jet is being generated.

demonstrate that the hourglass Weyl nodal loop and Weyl nodal line are

nodal loop and nodal line, and the nodal line can be transformed into the

  Extended Neighbourhood Rule with Features subspace","12 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To minimize the effect of outliers, kNN ensembles identify a set of closest
observations to a new sample point to estimate its unknown class by using
majority voting in the labels of the training instances in the neighbourhood.
Ordinary kNN based procedures determine k closest training observations in the
neighbourhood region (enclosed by a sphere) by using a distance formula. The k
nearest neighbours procedure may not work in a situation where sample points in
the test data follow the pattern of the nearest observations that lie on a
certain path not contained in the given sphere of nearest neighbours.
Furthermore, these methods combine hundreds of base kNN learners and many of
them might have high classification errors thereby resulting in poor ensembles.
To overcome these problems, an optimal extended neighbourhood rule based
ensemble is proposed where the neighbours are determined in k steps. It starts
from the first nearest sample point to the unseen observation. The second
nearest data point is identified that is closest to the previously selected
data point. This process is continued until the required number of the k
observations are obtained. Each base model in the ensemble is constructed on a
bootstrap sample in conjunction with a random subset of features. After
building a sufficiently large number of base models, the optimal models are
then selected based on their performance on out-of-bag (OOB) data.

theory (GUT) often predicts varieties of new scalars that couple to the
fermions and lead to some novel observational effects. We assess such a
possibility for the colour sextet diquark scalars within the realistic
renormalizable models based on $SO(10)$ GUT. The spectrum consists of five
sextets: $\Sigma \sim (6,1,-\frac{2}{3})$, $S \sim (6,1,\frac{1}{3})$,
$\overline{S}\sim(\overline{6},1,-\frac{1}{3})$, ${\cal
S}\sim(6,1,\frac{4}{3})$ and $\mathbb{S}\sim(\overline{6},3,-\frac{1}{3})$.
Computing explicitly their couplings with the quarks, we evaluate their
contributions to the neutral meson-antimeson mixing and baryon number-violating
processes like neutron-antineutron oscillation. The latter arises because of a
$B-L$ violating trilinear coupling between the sextets which also contributes
to some of the quartic couplings and perturbativity of the same leads to strong
limits on the sextet masses. Using the values of the $B-L$ breaking scale and
Yukawa couplings permitted in the realistic models, we derive constraints on
the masses of these scalars. It is found that $\Sigma$ along with any of the
remaining sextets cannot be lighter than the $B-L$ breaking scale,
simultaneously. In the realm of realistic models, this implies no observable
$n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation in near future experiments. We also point out a
possibility in which sub-GUT scale $\Sigma$ and a pair of $S$, allowed by the
other constraints, can viably produce the observed baryon asymmetry of the
universe.

to localize, which part of the face was modified, and (ii) to identify the
alteration type. Using extensive experiments on widely used datasets, SeeABLE
considerably outperforms existing detectors, with gains of up to +10\% on the

simulations via partial differential equations (PDEs), using the simulated
degrees of freedom as latent space for the neural network. In contrast to
previous work, we do not impose constraints on the simulated space, but rather
treat its degrees of freedom purely as tools to be used by the neural network.
We demonstrate this concept for learning reduced representations. It is
typically extremely challenging for conventional simulations to faithfully
preserve the correct solutions over long time-spans with traditional, reduced
representations. This problem is particularly pronounced for solutions with
large amounts of small scale features. Here, data-driven methods can learn to
restore the details as required for accurate solutions of the underlying PDE
problem. We explore the use of physical, reduced latent space within this
context, and train models such that they can modify the content of physical
states as much as needed to best satisfy the learning objective. Surprisingly,
this autonomy allows the neural network to discover alternate dynamics that
enable a significantly improved performance in the given tasks. We demonstrate
this concept for a range of challenging test cases, among others, for
Navier-Stokes based turbulence simulations.

4-momentum transfer and implementing non-perturbative unitarity bound, the

We consider the four exclusive semileptonic $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)}^{(*)} \ell

$1\sigma$ level. We address also the issue of Lepton Flavour Universality by
computing pure theoretical estimates of the $\tau/\ell$ ratios of the branching
fractions for each channel, where $\ell$ is a light lepton. In the case of a
light spectator quark we obtain $R(D^*) = 0.275(8)$ and $R(D) = 0.296(8)$,

interpolation (VFI) methods have achieved notable improvements. However, they
still fall short for real-world videos containing large motions. Complex
deformation and/or occlusion caused by large motions make it an extremely
difficult problem in video frame interpolation. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective solution, H-VFI, to deal with large motions in video frame
interpolation. H-VFI contributes a hierarchical video interpolation transformer
(HVIT) to learn a deformable kernel in a coarse-to-fine strategy in multiple
scales. The learnt deformable kernel is then utilized in convolving the input
frames for predicting the interpolated frame. Starting from the smallest scale,
H-VFI updates the deformable kernel by a residual in succession based on former
predicted kernels, intermediate interpolated results and hierarchical features
from transformer. Bias and masks to refine the final outputs are then predicted
by a transformer block based on interpolated results. The advantage of such a
progressive approximation is that the large motion frame interpolation problem
can be decomposed into several relatively simpler sub-tasks, which enables a
very accurate prediction in the final results. Another noteworthy contribution
of our paper consists of a large-scale high-quality dataset, YouTube200K, which
contains videos depicting a great variety of scenarios captured at high

interpolation benchmarks validate that H-VFI outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods especially for videos with large motions.

the cavity intensity to the OMIN near the cavity resonance, benefiting from
linewidth suppression caused by the vacuum induced coherence. The joint effect
of optical bistability and the linewidth suppression is inaccessible by the
anti-PT symmetric system involving only dissipative coupling. Due to that, the
sensitivity is greatly enhanced by two orders of magnitude compared to that for
the anti-PT symmetric model. Moreover, the sensitivity shows resistances to a
reasonably large cavity decay and robustness to fluctuations in the
cavity-waveguide detuning. Based on the integrated optomechanical

diffusive particles, has long been an important concept for describing
non-equilibrium self-organization in nature, and has been extensively
investigated in many chemical and biological systems. Historically, these
patterns have been studied in extended systems and lattices. Recently, the
Turing instability was found to produce topological patterns in networks with
scale-free degree distributions and the small world property, although with an
apparent absence of geometric organization. While hints of explicitly geometric
patterns in simple network models (e.g Watts-Strogatz) have been found, the
question of the exact nature and morphology of geometric Turing patterns in
heterogeneous complex networks remains unresolved. In this work, we study the
Turing instability in the framework of geometric random graph models, where the
network topology is explained by an underlying geometric space. We demonstrate
that not only can geometric patterns be observed, their wavelength can also be
estimated by studying the eigenvectors of the annealed graph Laplacian.
Finally, we show that Turing patterns can be found in geometric embeddings of
real networks. These results indicate that there is a profound connection
between the function of a network and its hidden geometry, even when the
associated dynamical processes are exclusively determined by the network
topology.

applications, e.g. self-driving cars, where safety and lives are at stake.
Recently, the robustness of existing skeleton-based HAR methods has been
questioned due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which causes
concerns considering the scale of the implication. However, the proposed
attacks require the full-knowledge of the attacked classifier, which is overly
restrictive. In this paper, we show such threats indeed exist, even when the
attacker only has access to the input/output of the model. To this end, we
propose the very first black-box adversarial attack approach in skeleton-based
HAR called BASAR. BASAR explores the interplay between the classification
boundary and the natural motion manifold. To our best knowledge, this is the
first time data manifold is introduced in adversarial attacks on time series.
Via BASAR, we find on-manifold adversarial samples are extremely deceitful and
rather common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that
adversarial samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation, we
show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across classifiers, datasets,
and attack modes. By attack, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of the
model vulnerability and provides insights on possible improvements. Finally, to
mitigate the newly identified threat, we propose a new adversarial training
approach by leveraging the sophisticated distributions of on/off-manifold
adversarial samples, called mixed manifold-based adversarial training (MMAT).
MMAT can successfully help defend against adversarial attacks without
compromising classification accuracy.

  for Efficient Vision Transformers",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision transformers have achieved significant improvements on various vision
tasks but their quadratic interactions between tokens significantly reduce
computational efficiency. Many pruning methods have been proposed to remove
redundant tokens for efficient vision transformers recently. However, existing
studies mainly focus on the token importance to preserve local attentive tokens
but completely ignore the global token diversity. In this paper, we emphasize
the cruciality of diverse global semantics and propose an efficient token
decoupling and merging method that can jointly consider the token importance
and diversity for token pruning. According to the class token attention, we
decouple the attentive and inattentive tokens. In addition to preserving the
most discriminative local tokens, we merge similar inattentive tokens and match
homogeneous attentive tokens to maximize the token diversity. Despite its
simplicity, our method obtains a promising trade-off between model complexity
and classification accuracy. On DeiT-S, our method reduces the FLOPs by 35%
with only a 0.2% accuracy drop. Notably, benefiting from maintaining the token
diversity, our method can even improve the accuracy of DeiT-T by 0.1% after
reducing its FLOPs by 40%.

for the holistic learning of large-size remote sensing image semantic
segmentation (LRISS). Large-size remote sensing images (LRIs) can lead to GPU
memory exhaustion due to their extremely large size, which has been handled in
previous works through either global-local fusion or multi-stage refinement,
both of which are limited in their ability to fully exploit the abundant
information available in LRIs. Unlike them, EHSNet features three
memory-friendly modules to utilize the characteristics of LRIs: a long-range
dependency module to develop long-range spatial context, an efficient
cross-correlation module to build holistic contextual relationships, and a
boundary-aware enhancement module to preserve complete object boundaries.
Moreover, EHSNet manages to process holistic LRISS with the aid of memory
offloading. To the best of our knowledge, EHSNet is the first method capable of
performing holistic LRISS. To make matters better, EHSNet outperforms previous
state-of-the-art competitors by a significant margin of +5.65 mIoU on FBP and
+4.28 mIoU on Inria Aerial, demonstrating its effectiveness. We hope that
EHSNet will provide a new perspective for LRISS. The code and models will be
made publicly available.

formulated as a one-class classification and segmentation task. The
student-teacher (S-T) framework has proved to be effective in solving this
challenge. However, previous works based on S-T only empirically applied
constraints on normal data and fused multi-level information. In this study, we
propose an improved model called DeSTSeg, which integrates a pre-trained
teacher network, a denoising student encoder-decoder, and a segmentation
network into one framework. First, to strengthen the constraints on anomalous
data, we introduce a denoising procedure that allows the student network to
learn more robust representations. From synthetically corrupted normal images,
we train the student network to match the teacher network feature of the same
images without corruption. Second, to fuse the multi-level S-T features
adaptively, we train a segmentation network with rich supervision from
synthetic anomaly masks, achieving a substantial performance improvement.
Experiments on the industrial inspection benchmark dataset demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, 98.6% on image-level AUC, 75.8%

data privacy preservation issues to some extent, the technique is quite
vulnerable to model inversion and model poisoning attacks. We assume that the
design of defense mechanism and attacks are two sides of the same coin.
Designing a method to reduce vulnerability requires the attack to be effective

simulated poisoning and inversion network (SPIN) that leverages the
optimization approach for reconstructing data from a differential model trained
by a vehicular node and intercepted when transmitted to roadside unit (RSU). We
then train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the generation of

Evaluation results show the qualitative and quantitative effectiveness of the
proposed approach. The attack initiated by SPIN can reduce up to 22% accuracy

dimensionality reduction methods. Development of efficient stochastic
approaches to these problems would allow them to scale to larger datasets.
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is one example of a GEP for dimensionality
reduction which has found extensive use in problems with two or more views of
the data. Deep learning extensions of CCA require large mini-batch sizes, and
therefore large memory consumption, in the stochastic setting to achieve good
performance and this has limited its application in practice. Inspired by the
Generalized Hebbian Algorithm, we develop an approach to solving stochastic
GEPs in which all constraints are softly enforced by Lagrange multipliers. Then
by considering the integral of this Lagrangian function, its pseudo-utility,
and inspired by recent formulations of Principal Components Analysis and GEPs
as games with differentiable utilities, we develop a game-theory inspired
approach to solving GEPs. We show that our approaches share much of the
theoretical grounding of the previous Hebbian and game theoretic approaches for
the linear case but our method permits extension to general function
approximators like neural networks for certain GEPs for dimensionality
reduction including CCA which means our method can be used for deep multiview

solving GEPs in the stochastic setting using canonical multiview datasets and

actions in untrimmed videos with only weak supervision information (e.g.
video-level labels). Most existing models handle all input videos with a fixed
temporal scale. However, such models are not sensitive to actions whose pace of
the movements is different from the ``normal"" speed, especially slow-motion
action instances, which complete the movements with a much slower speed than
their counterparts with a normal speed. Here arises the slow-motion blurred
issue: It is hard to explore salient slow-motion information from videos at
``normal"" speed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Slow Motion
Enhanced Network (SMEN) to improve the ability of a WTAL network by
compensating its sensitivity on slow-motion action segments. The proposed SMEN
comprises a Mining module and a Localization module. The mining module
generates mask to mine slow-motion-related features by utilizing the
relationships between the normal motion and slow motion; while the localization
module leverages the mined slow-motion features as complementary information to
improve the temporal action localization results. Our proposed framework can be
easily adapted by existing WTAL networks and enable them be more sensitive to
slow-motion actions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks are conducted,
which demonstrate the high performance of our proposed framework.

evaluate quantitative hardness of each unlabeled instance and supervises the
training on unlabeled data in a model-adaptive manner. Specifically, iMAS
learns from unlabeled instances progressively by weighing their corresponding
consistency losses based on the evaluated hardness. Besides, iMAS dynamically
adjusts the augmentation for each instance such that the distortion degree of
augmented instances is adapted to the model's generalization capability across

  Positive-Negative Prompt-Tuning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CL cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large-scale text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable progress
in synthesizing high-quality, feature-rich images with high resolution guided
by texts. However, these models often struggle with novel concepts, eg, new
styles, object entities, etc. Although recent attempts have employed
fine-tuning or prompt-tuning strategies to teach the pre-trained diffusion
model novel concepts from a reference image set,they have the drawback of
overfitting to the given reference images, particularly in one-shot
applications, which is harmful to generate diverse and high-quality images
while maintaining generation controllability.
  To tackle this challenge, we present a simple yet effective method called
DreamArtist, which employs a positive-negative prompt-tuning learning strategy.
Specifically, DreamArtist incorporates both positive and negative embeddings
and jointly trains them. The positive embedding aggressively captures the
salient characteristics of the reference image to drive diversified generation
and the negative embedding rectifies inadequacies from the positive embedding.
It learns not only what is correct, but also what can be avoided or improved.
We have conducted extensive experiments and evaluated the proposed method from
image similarity and diversity, generation controllability, and style cloning.
And our DreamArtist has achieved a superior generation performance over
existing methods. Besides, our additional evaluation on extended tasks,
including concept compositions and prompt-guided image editing, demonstrates
its effectiveness for more applications.

statistics. Motivated by the fact that this problem is highly non-robust (as
small perturbations in the distributions can drastically affect the support
size) and thus hard to estimate, Goldreich [ECCC 2019] studied the query
complexity of estimating the $\epsilon$-\emph{effective support size}
$\text{Ess}_\epsilon$ of a distribution ${P}$, which is equal to the smallest
support size of a distribution that is $\epsilon$-far in total variation
distance from ${P}$.
  In his paper, he shows an algorithm in the dual access setting (where we may
both receive random samples and query the sampling probability $p(x)$ for any
$x$) for a bicriteria approximation, giving an answer in
$[\text{Ess}_{(1+\beta)\epsilon},(1+\gamma) \text{Ess}_{\epsilon}]$ for some
values $\beta, \gamma > 0$. However, his algorithm has either super-constant
query complexity in the support size or super-constant approximation ratio
$1+\gamma = \omega(1)$. He then asked if this is necessary, or if it is
possible to get a constant-factor approximation in a number of queries
independent of the support size.
  We answer his question by showing that not only is complexity independent of
$n$ possible for $\gamma>0$, but also for $\gamma=0$, that is, that the
bicriteria relaxation is not necessary. Specifically, we show an algorithm with
query complexity $O(\frac{1}{\beta^3 \epsilon^3})$. That is, for any $0 <
\epsilon, \beta < 1$, we output in this complexity a number $\tilde{n} \in
[\text{Ess}_{(1+\beta)\epsilon},\text{Ess}_\epsilon]$. We also show that it is
possible to solve the approximate version with approximation ratio $1+\gamma$
in complexity $O\left(\frac{1}{\beta^2 \epsilon} + \frac{1}{\beta \epsilon
\gamma^2}\right)$. Our algorithm is very simple, and has $4$ short lines of

architecture minimizes a specifically designed energy function and defines its
temporal characteristics. The model has an internal and an external space that
are connected with a layered internetwork that consists of a pair of forward
and backward subnets composed of static neurons (with an instantaneous
time-course). Dynamical neurons with large time constants in the internal space
determine the overall time-course. The model offers a framework in which state
variables in the network relax in a warped space, due to the cooperation
between dynamic and static neurons. We assume that the system operates in
either a learning or an association mode, depending on the presence or absence
of feedback paths and input ports. In the learning mode, synaptic weights in
the internetwork are modified by strong inputs corresponding to repetitive
neuronal bursting, which represents sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waves in the
short-term average density of nerve impulses or in the membrane potential. A
two-dimensional mapping relationship can be formed by employing signals with
different frequencies based on the same mechanism as Lissajous curves. In the
association mode, the speed of convergence to a goal point greatly varies with
the mapping relationship of the previously trained internetwork, and owing to
this property, the convergence trajectory in the two-dimensional model with the
non-linear mapping internetwork cannot go straight but instead must curve. We
further introduce a constrained association mode with a given target trajectory
and elucidate that in the internal space, an output trajectory is generated,
which is mapped from the external space according to the inverse of the mapping
relationship of the forward subnet.

  titled: ""Data-Driven Offline Model-Based Optimization via Invariant
  Representation Learning""",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The goal in offline data-driven decision-making is synthesize decisions that
optimize a black-box utility function, using a previously-collected static
dataset, with no active interaction. These problems appear in many forms:
offline reinforcement learning (RL), where we must produce actions that
optimize the long-term reward, bandits from logged data, where the goal is to
determine the correct arm, and offline model-based optimization (MBO) problems,
where we must find the optimal design provided access to only a static dataset.
A key challenge in all these settings is distributional shift: when we optimize
with respect to the input into a model trained from offline data, it is easy to
produce an out-of-distribution (OOD) input that appears erroneously good. In
contrast to prior approaches that utilize pessimism or conservatism to tackle
this problem, in this paper, we formulate offline data-driven decision-making
as domain adaptation, where the goal is to make accurate predictions for the
value of optimized decisions (""target domain""), when training only on the
dataset (""source domain""). This perspective leads to invariant objective models
(IOM), our approach for addressing distributional shift by enforcing invariance
between the learned representations of the training dataset and optimized
decisions. In IOM, if the optimized decisions are too different from the
training dataset, the representation will be forced to lose much of the
information that distinguishes good designs from bad ones, making all choices
seem mediocre. Critically, when the optimizer is aware of this representational
tradeoff, it should choose not to stray too far from the training distribution,
leading to a natural trade-off between distributional shift and learning
performance.

factorization problem of difference operators. A special solution among them is
obtained from Okounkov and Pandharipande's dressing operators for the

magnetic fields penetrating the event horizon, and there are several possible
scenarios. Bearing this in mind and considering a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$
immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$, we show that all three frequencies
related to the equatorial circular orbit of a test particle become imaginary
for the orbits of radii $r_B > 2/B$. It signifies that if a BH is surrounded by
a magnetic field of order $B \sim M^{-1}$, a test particle could unable to
continue its regular geodesic motion from/at $r > r_B$, hence the accretion
disk could not be formed, and the motion of other stellar objects around the BH
could be absent. As the BHs are generally detected by watching for their
effects on nearby stars and gas, a magnetic field of order $B \sim M^{-1}$
could be able to shield a BH in such a way that it could remain undetectable.
Motivated with this theoretical investigation and considering the sphere (of
radius $r_f$) of magnetic influence around an astrophysical BH, we constrain
$B$, above which a magnetized BH could remain undetectable. For example,
$M=10^9M_{\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^6$ G and $M=10M_{\odot}$ BH
surrounded by $B > 10^{14}$ G could remain undetectable for $r_f \sim 10^5M$.
In other words, our result also explains why a detected SMBH has surprisingly
weak magnetic field.

enables attackers to trigger the worst-case complexity of certain algorithms.
Such vulnerabilities can be leveraged to deploy low-volume, asymmetric,
CPU-based denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Previous work speculates that these
vulnerabilities are more dangerous in certain web servers, like Node.js, than
in traditional ones, like Apache. We believe it is of utmost importance to
understand if this is indeed the case or if there are ways to compensate
against such problems using various deployment strategies. To this end, we
study the resilience of popular web servers against CPU-based DoS attacks in
four major cloud platforms under realistic deployment conditions. We find that
there are indeed significant differences in how various web servers react to an
attack. However, our results suggest a more nuanced landscape than previously
believed: while event-based systems tend to recover faster from DoS in certain
scenarios, they also suffer the worst performance degradation overall.
Nevertheless, in some setups, Apache performs worse than event-based systems,
and there are cloud platforms in which all the considered servers are seriously
exposed to the attack. We also find that developers can harden their servers
against CPU-based DoS attacks by increasing the number of server instances
running in parallel. This, in turn, can lead to an increased cost of operation
or a slight degradation of performance in non-DoS conditions.

sequential task training may cause catastrophic forgetting, which affects the
model performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a continual
pretraining method for the BERT-based model, named CBEAF-Adapting (Chinese
Biomedical Enhanced Attention-FFN Adapting). Its main idea is to introduce a
small number of attention heads and hidden units inside each self-attention
layer and feed-forward network. Using the Chinese biomedical domain as a
running example, we trained a domain-specific language model named
CBEAF-RoBERTa. We conduct experiments by applying models to downstream tasks.
The results demonstrate that with only about 3% of model parameters trained,
our method could achieve about 0.5%, 2% average performance gain compared to
the best performing model in baseline and the domain-specific model,
PCL-MedBERT, respectively. We also examine the forgetting problem of different
pretraining methods. Our method alleviates the problem by about 13% compared to
fine-tuning.

liquid film coating the inner side of a horizontal cylindrical tube and
surrounding a shear-free dynamically inert gaseous core. The liquid-gas
interface is prone to the Rayleigh-Plateau and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities.
Here, we focus on the limit of low and intermediate Bond numbers, Bo, where the
capillary and gravitational forces are comparable and the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability is known to be suppressed. We first study the evolution of the
axially invariant draining flow, initiating from a uniform film thickness until
reaching a quasi-static regime as the bubble approaches the upper tube wall. We
then investigate the flow linear stability within two frameworks: frozen
time-frame (quasi-steady) stability analysis and transient growth analysis. We
explore the effect of the surface tension (Bo) and inertia (measured by the
Ohnesorge number, Oh) on the flow and its stability. The linear stability
analysis suggests that the interface deformation at large Bo results in the
suppression of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in the asymptotic long-time
limit. Furthermore, the transient growth analysis suggests that the initial
flow evolution does not lead to any considerable additional amplification of
initial interface perturbations, a posteriori rationalising the quasi-steady
assumption. The present study yields a satisfactory prediction of the
stabilisation threshold found experimentally by Duclaux et al. [15].

asymmetries exhibited by a process. These asymmetries might be in the
conditional independence relationships or in the structure of the graph and its
underlying event space. Structural asymmetries are common in many domains, and
can occur naturally (e.g. a defendant vs prosecutor's version of events) or by

software that allows a user to leverage the theoretical developments of the CEG
model family in modelling processes with structural asymmetries. This paper
introduces cegpy, the first Python package for learning and analysing complex
processes using CEGs. The key feature of cegpy is that it is the first CEG
package in any programming language that can model processes with symmetric as

model selection and probability propagation algorithms for CEGs. We illustrate
the functionality of cegpy using a structurally asymmetric dataset.

estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent

via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee
recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop
exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in
which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. By
doing so, we are able to optimize the design of the spectral method, and
combine it with a simple linear estimator, in order to minimize the estimation
error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free

unique system in condensed matter physics. They combine the exotic electronic

confinement and topologically protected states can emerge. An exciting prospect
for this new material concept is the potential for both a tunable
semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge.
This combination of magnetism and semiconducting properties is the first step
in unlocking spin-based electronics such as non-volatile transistors, a route
to low-energy computing, and has thus far typically only been observed in doped
semiconductor systems and/or at low temperatures. Here, we report the magnetic
and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). Static (SQUID)
and dynamic (EPR) magnetization probes demonstrate that at room temperature,
films of PNRs exhibit macroscopic magnetic properties, arising from their edge,
with internal fields of ~ 250 to 800 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic
anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at modest sub-1T fields. By leveraging
this alignment effect, we discover that upon photoexcitation, energy is rapidly
funneled to a dark-exciton state that is localized to the magnetic edge and
coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as
a unique candidate system for studying the interplay of magnetism and
semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone

predict. This makes the design of accurate and stable reduced-order models
challenging. The overarching objective of this paper is to propose a nonlinear
decomposition of the turbulent state for a reduced-order representation of the
dynamics. We divide the turbulent flow into a spatial problem and a temporal
problem. First, we compute the latent space, which is the manifold onto which
the turbulent dynamics live (i.e., it is a numerical approximation of the
turbulent attractor). The latent space is found by a series of nonlinear
filtering operations, which are performed by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE).
The CAE provides the decomposition in space. Second, we predict the time
evolution of the turbulent state in the latent space, which is performed by an
echo state network (ESN). The ESN provides the decomposition in time. Third, by
assembling the CAE and the ESN, we obtain an autonomous dynamical system: the
convolutional autoncoder echo state network (CAE-ESN). This is the
reduced-order model of the turbulent flow. We test the CAE-ESN on a
two-dimensional flow. We show that, after training, the CAE-ESN (i) finds a
latent-space representation of the turbulent flow that has less than 1% of the
degrees of freedom than the physical space; (ii) time-accurately and
statistically predicts the flow in both quasiperiodic and turbulent regimes;
(iii) is robust for different flow regimes (Reynolds numbers); and (iv) takes
less than 1% of computational time to predict the turbulent flow than solving
the governing equations. This work opens up new possibilities for nonlinear
decompositions and reduced-order modelling of turbulent flows from data.

error of this `average' mean field model for a two-timescale model
$(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Y})$, where the slow component $\boldsymbol{X}$
describes a population of interacting particles which is fully coupled with a
rapidly changing environment $\boldsymbol{Y}$. The model is parametrized by a
scaling factor $N$, e.g. the population size, which as $N$ gets large decreases
the jump size of the slow component in contrast to the unchanged dynamics of
the fast component. We show that under relatively mild conditions, the
`average' mean field approximation has a bias of order $O(1/N)$ compared to
$\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{X}]$. This holds true under any continuous performance
metric in the transient regime, as well as for the steady-state if the model is
exponentially stable. To go one step further, we derive a bias correction term
for the steady-state, from which we define a new approximation called the
refined `average' mean field approximation whose bias is of order $O(1/N^2)$.
This refined `average' mean field approximation allows computing an accurate

different fields. In particular, the idea of bridging predictions (machine
learning models) and prescriptions (optimization problems) is gaining attention
within the scientific community. One of the main ideas to address this
trade-off is the so-called Constraint Learning (CL) methodology, where the
structures of the machine learning model can be treated as a set of constraints
to be embedded within the optimization problem, establishing the relationship
between a direct decision variable $x$ and a response variable $y$. However,
most CL approaches have focused on making point predictions for a certain
variable, not taking into account the statistical and external uncertainty
faced in the modeling process. In this paper, we extend the CL methodology to
deal with uncertainty in the response variable $y$. The novel Distributional
Constraint Learning (DCL) methodology makes use of a piece-wise linearizable
neural network-based model to estimate the parameters of the conditional
distribution of $y$ (dependent on decisions $x$ and contextual information),
which can be embedded within mixed-integer optimization problems. In
particular, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by sampling random
values from the estimated distribution by using a linear set of constraints. In
this sense, DCL combines both the high predictive performance of the neural
network method and the possibility of generating scenarios to account for
uncertainty within a tractable optimization model. The behavior of the proposed
methodology is tested in a real-world problem in the context of electricity
systems, where a Virtual Power Plant seeks to optimize its operation, subject

modern computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology based on deep convolutions.
However, the information aggregation across modalities in MSLD remains
challenging due to severity unaligned spatial resolution (e.g., dermoscopic
image and clinical image) and heterogeneous data (e.g., dermoscopic image and
patients' meta-data). Limited by the intrinsic local attention, most recent
MSLD pipelines using pure convolutions struggle to capture representative
features in shallow layers, thus the fusion across different modalities is
usually done at the end of the pipelines, even at the last layer, leading to an
insufficient information aggregation. To tackle the issue, we introduce a pure
transformer-based method, which we refer to as ``Throughout Fusion Transformer
(TFormer)'', for sufficient information integration in MSLD. Different from the
existing approaches with convolutions, the proposed network leverages
transformer as feature extraction backbone, bringing more representative
shallow features. We then carefully design a stack of dual-branch hierarchical
multi-modal transformer (HMT) blocks to fuse information across different image
modalities in a stage-by-stage way. With the aggregated information of image
modalities, a multi-modal transformer post-fusion (MTP) block is designed to
integrate features across image and non-image data. Such a strategy that
information of the image modalities is firstly fused then the heterogeneous

  Orientation Estimation from RGB Images Without Pose Labels",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Object pose estimation is a necessary prerequisite for autonomous robotic
manipulation, but the presence of symmetry increases the complexity of the pose
estimation task. Existing methods for object pose estimation output a single 6D
pose. Thus, they lack the ability to reason about symmetries. Lately, modeling
object orientation as a non-parametric probability distribution on the SO(3)
manifold by neural networks has shown impressive results. However, acquiring
large-scale datasets to train pose estimation models remains a bottleneck. To
address this limitation, we introduce an automatic pose labeling scheme. Given
RGB-D images without object pose annotations and 3D object models, we design a
two-stage pipeline consisting of point cloud registration and
render-and-compare validation to generate multiple symmetrical
pseudo-ground-truth pose labels for each image. Using the generated pose
labels, we train an ImplicitPDF model to estimate the likelihood of an
orientation hypothesis given an RGB image. An efficient hierarchical sampling
of the SO(3) manifold enables tractable generation of the complete set of
symmetries at multiple resolutions. During inference, the most likely
orientation of the target object is estimated using gradient ascent. We
evaluate the proposed automatic pose labeling scheme and the ImplicitPDF model
on a photorealistic dataset and the T-Less dataset, demonstrating the
advantages of the proposed method.

tiny model with less accuracy loss. While methods to obtain better codebooks
and codes under fixed clustering dimensionality have been extensively studied,
optimizations of the vectors in favour of clustering performance are not
carefully considered, especially via the reduction of vector dimensionality.
This paper reports our recent progress on the combination of dimensionality
compression and vector quantization, proposing a Low-Rank Representation Vector
Quantization ($\text{LR}^2\text{VQ}$) method that outperforms previous VQ
algorithms in various tasks and architectures. $\text{LR}^2\text{VQ}$ joins
low-rank representation with subvector clustering to construct a new kind of
building block that is directly optimized through end-to-end training over the
task loss. Our proposed design pattern introduces three hyper-parameters, the
number of clusters $k$, the size of subvectors $m$ and the clustering
dimensionality $\tilde{d}$. In our method, the compression ratio could be
directly controlled by $m$, and the final accuracy is solely determined by
$\tilde{d}$. We recognize $\tilde{d}$ as a trade-off between low-rank
approximation error and clustering error and carry out both theoretical
analysis and experimental observations that empower the estimation of the
proper $\tilde{d}$ before fine-tunning. With a proper $\tilde{d}$, we evaluate
$\text{LR}^2\text{VQ}$ with ResNet-18/ResNet-50 on ImageNet classification
datasets, achieving 2.8\%/1.0\% top-1 accuracy improvements over the current
state-of-the-art VQ-based compression algorithms with 43$\times$/31$\times$

conducted with different existing and newly created challenging benchmark
datasets and the results indicate that RAILD leads to performance improvement
over the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, since there are no existing

created our own baselines and the results obtained with RAILD also outperform

resolution in reconstructed virtual images from scanning precession electron
diffraction data. By utilizing fast pixelated electron detector technology,
multiple frames are recorded for each azimuthal rotation of the beam, allowing
for the probe wandering to be corrected in post-acquisition processing. Not
only is there an apparent increase in the resolution of the reconstructed
images, but probe wandering due to instrument misalignment is reduced,
potentially easing an already difficult alignment procedure.

progressive-iterative approximation method for fairing curve and surface

a series of curves (surfaces) by adjusting the control points of B-spline
curves (surfaces). In fairing-PIA, each control point is endowed with an
individual weight. Thus, the fairing-PIA has many parameters to optimize the
shapes of curves and surfaces. Not only a fairing curve (surface) can be
generated globally through fairing-PIA, but also the curve (surface) can be
improved locally. Moreover, we prove the convergence of the developed
fairing-PIA and show that the conventional energy minimization fairing model is
a special case of fairing-PIA. Finally, numerical examples indicate that the

important not only to infer the intrinsic properties of astronomical objects
but also to understand the star/planet formation in the galaxies. From the
non-Milky-Way-like extinction and interstellar polarization (ISP) observed in
reddened Type Ia supernovae (SNe), it has been suggested that their host
galaxies contain dust grains whose properties are substantially different from
the Milky-Way (MW) dust. It is important to investigate the universality of
such non-MW-like dust in the universe. Here we report spectropolarimetry of two
highly-extinguished Type II SNe (SN 2022aau and SN 2022ame). SN 2022aau shows a
polarization maximum at a shorter wavelength than MW stars, which is also
observed in some Type Ia SNe. This is clear evidence for the existence of
non-MW-like dust in its host galaxy (i.e., NGC 1672). This fact implies that
such non-MW-like dust might be more common in some environments than expected,
and thus it might affect the picture of the star/planet formation. On the other
hand, SN 2022ame shows MW-like ISP, implying the presence of MW-like dust in
its host galaxy (i.e., NGC 1255). Our findings confirm that dust properties of
galaxies are diverse, either locally or globally. The present work demonstrates
that further investigation of IS dust properties in external galaxies using
polarimetry of highly-reddened SNe is promising, providing a great opportunity
to study the universality of such non-MW-like dust grains in the universe.

transferable model for unlabeled target domain by exploiting source labeled
data. Optimal Transport (OT) based methods recently have been proven to be a
promising direction for domain adaptation due to their competitive performance.
However, most of these methods coarsely aligned source and target
distributions, leading to the over-aligned problem where the
category-discriminative information is mixed up although domain-invariant
representations can be learned. In this paper, we propose a Deep Hierarchical
Optimal Transport method (DeepHOT) for unsupervised domain adaptation. The main
idea is to use hierarchical optimal transport to learn both domain-invariant
and category-discriminative representations by mining the rich structural
correlations among domain data. The DeepHOT framework consists of a
domain-level OT and an image-level OT, where the latter is used as the ground
distance metric for the former. The image-level OT captures structural
associations of local image regions that are beneficial to image
classification, while the domain-level OT learns domain-invariant
representations by leveraging the underlying geometry of domains. However, due
to the high computational complexity, the optimal transport based models are
limited in some scenarios. To this end, we propose a robust and efficient
implementation of the DeepHOT framework by approximating origin OT with sliced
Wasserstein distance in image-level OT and using a mini-batch unbalanced
optimal transport for domain-level OT. Extensive experiments show that DeepHOT
surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in four benchmark datasets. Code will be
released on GitHub.

However, such learned shared latent spaces are not often optimal, and the
modality gap between visual and textual representation can not be fully
eliminated. In this paper, we propose Expectation-Maximization Contrastive
Learning (EMCL) to learn compact video-and-language representations.
Specifically, we use the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to find a compact
set of bases for the latent space, where the features could be concisely
represented as the linear combinations of these bases. Such feature
decomposition of video-and-language representations reduces the rank of the
latent space, resulting in increased representing power for the semantics.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark text-video retrieval datasets prove
that our EMCL can learn more discriminative video-and-language representations
than previous methods, and significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art
methods across all metrics. More encouragingly, the proposed method can be
applied to boost the performance of existing approaches either as a jointly

rapid screening of large volumes of images. To perform data analysis while
maintaining patient privacy, we create ML models that satisfy Differential
Privacy (DP). Previous works exploring private COVID-19 models are in part
based on small datasets, provide weaker or unclear privacy guarantees, and do
not investigate practical privacy. We suggest improvements to address these
open gaps. We account for inherent class imbalances and evaluate the
utility-privacy trade-off more extensively and over stricter privacy budgets.
Our evaluation is supported by empirically estimating practical privacy through
black-box Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). The introduced DP should help
limit leakage threats posed by MIAs, and our practical analysis is the first to
test this hypothesis on the COVID-19 classification task. Our results indicate
that needed privacy levels might differ based on the task-dependent practical
threat from MIAs. The results further suggest that with increasing DP
guarantees, empirical privacy leakage only improves marginally, and DP
therefore appears to have a limited impact on practical MIA defense. Our
findings identify possibilities for better utility-privacy trade-offs, and we
believe that empirical attack-specific privacy estimation can play a vital role
in tuning for practical privacy.

  In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach that is generic and easy
to deploy, while producing reliable uncertainty estimates on par with
state-of-the-art methods at a significantly lower computational cost. It is
predicated on training the network to produce the same output with and without

due to a limited receptive field. In addition, many deep learning SR methods
suffer from intensive computations. To address these problems, we introduce the
N-Gram context to the low-level vision with Transformers for the first time. We
define N-Gram as neighboring local windows in Swin, which differs from text
analysis that views N-Gram as consecutive characters or words. N-Grams interact
with each other by sliding-WSA, expanding the regions seen to restore degraded
pixels. Using the N-Gram context, we propose NGswin, an efficient SR network
with SCDP bottleneck taking multi-scale outputs of the hierarchical encoder.
Experimental results show that NGswin achieves competitive performance while
maintaining an efficient structure when compared with previous leading methods.
Moreover, we also improve other Swin-based SR methods with the N-Gram context,
thereby building an enhanced model: SwinIR-NG. Our improved SwinIR-NG

larger than $62$ to solve the horizon and flatness problems of Big Bang theory.
Notably, this KS inflation generates a nearly scale-invariant primordial

with maritime navigation. William Dawes, a British Marine who had been trained
in practical astronomy, was assigned to the ""First Fleet"", a convoy of eleven
ships that left England in May 1787 bound for Botany Bay (Sydney, Australia).
Dawes was also expected to take measurements of the local gravitational
acceleration, $g$, at any port of call by measuring the daily rate by which his
Shelton pendulum clock differed from that at Greenwich, its calibration
location. Although Dawes and Nevil Maskelyne, Britain's fifth Astronomer Royal,
had planned to obtain clock-rate measurements in the Canary Islands, San
Sebastian (Rio de Janeiro) and Table Bay, Captain Arthur Phillip, Commander of
the First Fleet, only allowed Dawes to disembark the clock in Rio de Janeiro.
Therefore, we have just one set of clock-rate measurements from the voyage, in
addition to land-based measurements obtained in New South Wales. If gravity was
the dominant factor affecting the clock's changing rate, Dawes' measurement of
$-48.067$ sec per (sidereal) day obtained in Rio de Janeiro implies a local
gravitational acceleration, $g = 9.7946$ m sec$^{-2}$. On the other hand, if we
adopt the modern value, $g = 9.7878$ m s$^{-2}$, the implied daily decay rate
is almost exactly 30 sec greater than Dawes' clock-rate determination, a
difference that is well in excess of the prevailing uncertainties. This
suggests that the pendulum's regulator nut may have been offset by a full turn,
thus implying that our assumptions regarding the pendulum length may have to be
revisited.

$\mathcal{W}$ to extended latent space $\mathcal{W^+}$ to feature space
$\mathcal{F}$ in StyleGAN, the editability of GAN inversion decreases while its
reconstruction quality increases. Recent GAN inversion methods typically
explore $\mathcal{W^+}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ rather than $\mathcal{W}$ to improve

$\mathcal{F}$ are derived from $\mathcal{W}$ that is essentially the foundation

align $\mathcal{W}$ and the image space for precise latent code discovery. %The
obtaining process is by using contrastive learning to align $\mathcal{W}$ and

obtained latent code in $\mathcal{W}$ into $\mathcal{W^+}$ and $\mathcal{F}$,
accordingly. Our experiments show that our exploration of the foundation latent

$\mathcal{W^+}$ and features in $\mathcal{F}$, which yields state-of-the-art
reconstruction fidelity and editability results on the standard benchmarks.

reference models across different views and levels. Modeling stretches from the
requirements and capabilities over their subdivision to services and components
up to the realization in processes and data structures. Benefits include an
end-to-end traceability of the capability coverage with performance parameters

agent's policy. Once the victim observes the trigger signal, it will switch to
the abnormal mode and fail its task. Most of the attacks assume the adversary
can arbitrarily modify the victim's observations, which may not be practical.
One work proposes to let one adversary agent use its actions to affect its
opponent in two-agent competitive games, so that the opponent quickly fails
after observing certain trigger actions. However, in multiagent collaborative
systems, agents may not always be able to observe others. When and how much the
adversary agent can affect others are uncertain, and we want the adversary
agent to trigger others for as few times as possible. To solve this problem, we
first design a novel training framework to produce auxiliary rewards that
measure the extent to which the other agents'observations being affected. Then
we use the auxiliary rewards to train a trigger policy which enables the
adversary agent to efficiently affect the others' observations. Given these
affected observations, we further train the other agents to perform abnormally.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables the
adversary agent to lure the others into the abnormal mode with only a few
actions.

objects, but actually ubiquitous among hot and massive stars. The opacities due
to spectral lines are the decisive ingredient that allows hot, massive stars to
launch powerful winds. While the fundamental principles of these so-called
line-driven winds have been realized decades ago, their proper quantitative
prediction is still a major challenge today. Established theoretical and

(MI) decoding from electroenchephalography (EEG) data. Multi-subject EEG
datasets present several kinds of domain shifts due to various inter-individual
differences (e.g. brain anatomy, personality and cognitive profile). These
domain shifts render multi-subject training a challenging task and also impede
robust cross-subject generalization. Method: We propose a two-stage model
ensemble architecture, built with multiple feature extractors (first stage) and
a shared classifier (second stage), which we train end-to-end with two loss
terms. The first loss applies curriculum learning, forcing each feature
extractor to specialize to a subset of the training subjects and promoting
feature diversity. The second loss is an intra-ensemble distillation objective
that allows collaborative exchange of knowledge between the models of the
ensemble. Results: We compare our method against several state-of-the-art
techniques, conducting subject-independent experiments on two large MI
datasets, namely Physionet and OpenBMI. Our algorithm outperforms all of the
methods in both 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out evaluation
settings, using a substantially lower number of trainable parameters.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that our model ensembling approach combining the
powers of curriculum learning and collaborative training, leads to high
learning capacity and robust performance. Significance: Our work addresses the
issue of domain shifts in multi-subject EEG datasets, paving the way for
calibration-free BCI systems.

of the effective interaction coefficient of the overall system. In
Curie-Weiss-Potts model with $a=0, \ b=1, \ m=1$, critical phase transition
appears at the inverse-temperature $\beta_c$, and mixing transition occurs at
$\beta_s$. Generalizing this fact to our model, we explicitly find the critical
inverse temperatures $\beta_c/J, \ \beta_s/J$ for the phase transition and

nuclear modification factor, $R_\mathrm{AA}$, used to characterize jet
suppression in Pb+Pb collisions, is presented differentially in $r_\mathrm{g}$,
jet transverse momentum, and in intervals of collision centrality. The
$R_\mathrm{AA}$ value is observed to depend significantly on jet
$r_\mathrm{g}$. Jets produced with the largest measured $r_\mathrm{g}$ are
found to be twice as suppressed as those with the smallest $r_\mathrm{g}$ in

variation with jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ in any of the $r_\mathrm{g}$ intervals. The

convection, one would like to disentangle genuine consequences of compression
from spatial variations of transport properties. In the present work, we
consider a very peculiar equation of state, whereby entropy is solely dependent
on density, so that a nearly isentropic fluid domain is nearly isochoric.
Within this class of equations of state, there is a thermal adiabatic gradient
and a key property of compressible convection is still present, namely its
capacity to viscously dissipate a large fraction of the thermal energy
involved, of the order of the well-named dissipation number. In a series of
anelastic approximations, under the assumption of an infinite Prandtl number,
the number of governing parameters can be brought down to two, the Rayleigh
number and the dissipation number. This framework is proposed as a playground
for compressible convection, an opportunity to extend the vast corpus of
theoretical analyses on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations regarding stability,
bifurcations or the determination of upper bounds for the turbulent heat
transfer. Here, in a two-dimensional geometry, we concentrate on the structure
of upward and downward plumes depending on the dissipation number, on the heat
flux dependence on the dissipation number and on the ratio of dissipation to
convective heat flux. For dissipation numbers of order unity, in the limit of
large Rayleigh numbers, dissipation becomes related to the entropy heat flux at
each depth, so that the vertical dissipation profile can be predicted, and
consequently so does the total ratio of dissipation to convective heat flux.

Hausdorff dimensions of the Ahlfors regular images of the space by
quasisymmetric transformations. For a given regular Dirichlet form with the
heat kernel, the spectral dimension $d_s$ is an exponent which indicates the
short-time asymptotic behavior of the on-diagonal part of the heat kernel. In
this paper, we consider the Dirichlet form induced by a resistance form on a
set $X$ and the associated resistance metric $R$. We prove
$\dim_\mathrm{ARC}(X,R)\le \overline{d_s}<2$ for $\overline{d_s}$, a variation
of $d_s$ defined through the on-diagonal asymptotics of the heat kernel. We
also give an example of a resistance form whose spectral dimension $d_s$
satisfies the opposite inequality $d_s<\dim_\mathrm{ARC}(X,R)<2.$

studied experimentally. A single layer of micron-size plastic microspheres was
suspended in the plasma sheath of a radio-frequency discharge in argon at low
pressure. The particle sample used was a mixture of regular particles and Janus
particles, which were coated on one side with a thin layer of platinum. Unlike
a suspension consisting of regular particles only, the suspension with
inclusion of Janus particles did not form an ordered lattice in the
experimental conditions used. Instead, the particles moved around with high
kinetic energy in a disordered suspension. Unexpectedly, the mean kinetic
energy of the particles declined as the illumination laser power was increased.
This is explained by the competition of two driving forces, the photophoretic
force and the oppositely directed ion drag force. The mean-squared displacement
of the particles scaled as $t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2$ at small times $t$
indicating ballistic motion and $\alpha=0.56\pm0.27$ at longer times due to the
combined effect of the Janus particle propensity to move in circular
trajectories and external confinement.

technology offers new opportunities to meet high-throughput and low-latency
communication as well as high-resolution localization requirements in vehicular
networks. However, considering the limited transmit power of the road site
units (RSUs) and the relatively small radar cross section (RCS) of vehicles
with random reflection coefficients, the power of echo signals may be too weak
to be utilized for effective target detection and tracking. Moreover,
high-frequency signals usually suffer from large fading loss when penetrating
vehicles, which seriously degrades the quality of communication services inside
the vehicles. To handle this issue, we propose a novel sensing-assisted
communication mechanism by employing an intelligent omni-surface (IOS) on the
surface of vehicles to enhance both sensing and communication (S&C)
performance. To this end, we first propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, including
the joint S&C stage and the communication-only stage, to fulfill more efficient
communication performance improvements benefited from sensing. The achievable
communication rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the
transmit beamforming, the IOS phase shifts, and the duration of the joint S&C
stage. However, solving this ISAC optimization problem is highly non-trivial
since inaccurate estimation and measurement information renders the achievable
rate lack of closed-form expression. To handle this issue, we first derive a
closed-form expression of the achievable rate under uncertain location
information, and then unveil a sufficient and necessary condition for the
existence of the joint S&C stage to offer useful insights for practical system
design. Moreover, two typical scenarios including interference-limited and
noise-limited cases are analyzed.

the monopole hopping. This induces an anti-trapping effect of the McP, which
refers to the fact that the dressing enhances the mobility of the McP, in

bipolarons are shown to exist under the simultaneous doping of a north and a

In this paper, we investigate how to apply the positioning reference signal

approach has the unique benefit of compatibility with the most advanced mobile
communication system available so far. Thus, the PRS can be regarded as a
sensing reference signal to simultaneously realize the functions of radar
sensing, communication and positioning in a convenient manner. Firstly, we
propose a PRS based radar sensing scheme and analyze its range and velocity
estimation performance, based on which we propose a method that improves the
accuracy of velocity estimation by using multiple frames. Furthermore, the
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the range and velocity estimation for PRS
based radar sensing and the CRLB of the range estimation for PRS based

scheme for generalization improvements by minimizing the sharpness measure
within a small neighborhood and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However,
SAM requires two consecutive gradient evaluations for solving the min-max
problem and inevitably doubles the training time. In this paper, we resort to
filter-wise random weight perturbations (RWP) to decouple the nested gradients
in SAM. Different from the small adversarial perturbations in SAM, RWP is
softer and allows a much larger magnitude of perturbations. Specifically, we
jointly optimize the loss function with random perturbations and the original
loss function: the former guides the network towards a wider flat region while
the latter helps recover the necessary local information. These two loss terms
are complementary to each other and mutually independent. Hence, the
corresponding gradients can be efficiently computed in parallel, enabling
nearly the same training speed as regular training. As a result, we achieve
very competitive performance on CIFAR and remarkably better performance on
ImageNet (e.g. $\mathbf{ +1.1\%}$) compared with SAM, but always require half

collective dynamics in complex systems. Most real networks exhibit sparsely
connected properties, and the connection parameter is a signal (0 or 1).
Well-known shrinkage methods such as lasso or compressed sensing (CS) to
recover structures of complex networks cannot suitably reveal such a property;
therefore, the signal lasso method was proposed recently to solve the network
reconstruction problem and was found to outperform lasso and CS methods.
However, signal lasso suffers the problem that the estimated coefficients that
fall between 0 and 1 cannot be successfully selected to the correct class. We
propose a new method, adaptive signal lasso, to estimate the signal parameter
and uncover the topology of complex networks with a small number of
observations. The proposed method has three advantages: (1) It can effectively
uncover the network topology with high accuracy and is capable of completely
shrinking the signal parameter to either 0 or 1, which eliminates the
unclassified portion in network reconstruction; (2) The method performs well in
scenarios of both sparse and dense signals and is robust to noise
contamination; (3) The method only needs to select one tuning parameter versus
two in signal lasso, which greatly reduces the computational cost and is easy
to apply. The theoretical properties of this method are studied, and numerical
simulations from linear regression, evolutionary games, and Kuramoto models are

in 18 languages, from October 2019 to March 2021, to quantify misinformation
flows between users exposed to anti-vaccination (no-vax) content. We find that,
during the pandemic, no-vax communities became more central in the
country-specific debates and their cross-border connections strengthened,
revealing a global Twitter anti-vaccination network. U.S. users are central in
this network, while Russian users also become net exporters of misinformation
during vaccination roll-out. Interestingly, we find that Twitter's content
moderation efforts, and in particular the suspension of users following the
January 6th U.S. Capitol attack, had a worldwide impact in reducing
misinformation spread about vaccines. These findings may help public health

commonly by measuring a power excess sourced by the axion effective current
density. Constraining axion parameters from detection or lack thereof requires
estimating the expected signal power. Often, this is done by studying the
response of the haloscope to a known, but different, source current density,
for example via a reflection measurement. However, only in the special case
when both sources induce the same electromagnetic fields, do the quantities
derived from a reflection measurement adequately describe the setup during an

cavity haloscope, new broadband or open designs like dish antennas or
dielectric haloscopes cannot make this assumption. A more general relation
between axion- and reflection-induced fields is needed. In this article, we use
the Lorentz reciprocity theorem to derive an expression for the axion signal
power which instead of the unmeasurable axion-induced fields depends on the
measurable reflection-induced fields. This entirely circumvents the need to
know the response of the haloscope to the unknown axion source. It applies to a
wide variety of haloscopes including resonant cavities, dielectric haloscopes,

segmentation models for clinical use. Since it is less possible to distribute
training data with the pre-trained model due to the huge data size and privacy
concern, source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFDA) has recently been
increasingly studied based on either pseudo labels or prior knowledge. However,
the image features and probability maps used by pseudo label-based SFDA and the
consistent prior assumption and the prior prediction network used by
prior-guided SFDA may become less reliable when the domain discrepancy is
large. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{Pro}mpt learning based \textbf{SFDA}
(\textbf{ProSFDA}) method for medical image segmentation, which aims to improve
the quality of domain adaption by minimizing explicitly the domain discrepancy.
Specifically, in the prompt learning stage, we estimate source-domain images
via adding a domain-aware prompt to target-domain images, then optimize the
prompt via minimizing the statistic alignment loss, and thereby prompt the
source model to generate reliable predictions on (altered) target-domain
images. In the feature alignment stage, we also align the features of
target-domain images and their styles-augmented counterparts to optimize the
source model, and hence push the model to extract compact features. We evaluate
our ProSFDA on two multi-domain medical image segmentation benchmarks. Our
results indicate that the proposed ProSFDA outperforms substantially other SFDA
methods and is even comparable to UDA methods. Code will be available at

carry information about the dense matter phase in these compact stars. The
crust-core interfacial mode is an oscillation mode in a neutron star and it
depends mostly on the equation of the state of the matter in the crust-core
transition region. This mode can be resonantly excited by the tidal field of an
inspiraling-in BNS system, thereby affecting the emitted gravitational waves,
and hence could be used to probe the equation of state in the crust-core
transition region. In this work, we investigate in detail how the first-order
phase transition inside the neutron star affects the properties of the
crust-core interfacial mode, using a Newtonian fluid perturbation theory on a
general relativistic background solution of the stellar structure. Two possible
types of phase transitions are considered: (1) the phase transitions happen in
the fluid core but near the crust-core interface, which results in density
discontinuities; and (2) the strong interaction phase transitions in the dense
core (as in the conventional hybrid star case). These phase transitions'
impacts on interfacial mode properties are discussed. In particular, the former
phase transition has a minor effect on the M-R relation and the adiabatic tidal
deformability, but can significantly affect the interfacial mode frequency and
thereby could be probed using gravitational waves. For the BNS systems, we
discuss the possible observational signatures of these phase transitions in the
gravitational waveforms and their detectability. Our work enriches the
exploration of the physical properties of the crust-core interfacial mode and
provides a promising method for probing the phase transition using the
seismology of a compact star.

manipulation in unstructured environments. Open-set object detection (OSOD) is
a promising direction to handle the problem consisting of two subtasks: objects
and background separation, and open-set object classification. In this paper,
we present Openset RCNN to address the challenging OSOD. To disambiguate
unknown objects and background in the first subtask, we propose to use
classification-free region proposal network (CF-RPN) which estimates the
objectness score of each region purely using cues from object's location and
shape preventing overfitting to the training categories. To identify unknown
objects in the second subtask, we propose to represent them using the
complementary region of known categories in a latent space which is
accomplished by a prototype learning network (PLN). PLN performs instance-level
contrastive learning to encode proposals to a latent space and builds a compact
region centering with a prototype for each known category. Further, we note
that the detection performance of unknown objects can not be unbiasedly
evaluated on the situation that commonly used object detection datasets are not
fully annotated. Thus, a new benchmark is introduced by reorganizing
GraspNet-1billion, a robotic grasp pose detection dataset with complete
annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the merits of our method. We
finally show that our Openset RCNN can endow the robot with an open-set
perception ability to support robotic rearrangement tasks in cluttered

RGB-D cameras and LiDARs. This paper focuses on the problem of estimating the
optimal planes and sensor poses to minimize the point-to-plane distance. The
resulting least-squares problem is referred to as plane adjustment (PA) in the
literature, which is the counterpart of bundle adjustment (BA) in visual
reconstruction. Iterative methods are adopted to solve these least-squares
problems. Typically, Newton's method is rarely used for a large-scale
least-squares problem, due to the high computational complexity of the Hessian
matrix. Instead, methods using an approximation of the Hessian matrix, such as
the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method, are generally adopted. This paper
challenges this ingrained idea. We adopt the Newton's method to efficiently
solve the PA problem. Specifically, given poses, the optimal planes have
close-form solutions. Thus we can eliminate planes from the cost function,
which significantly reduces the number of variables. Furthermore, as the
optimal planes are functions of poses, this method actually ensures that the
optimal planes for the current estimated poses can be obtained at each
iteration, which benefits the convergence. The difficulty lies in how to
efficiently compute the Hessian matrix and the gradient of the resulting cost.
This paper provides an efficient solution. Empirical evaluation shows that our
algorithm converges significantly faster than the widely used LM algorithm.

converting temporal signals received from transducer elements into a spatial
echogenecity map. This beamforming (BF) step requires the knowledge of
speed-of-sound (SoS) value in the imaged medium. An incorrect assumption of BF
SoS leads to aberration artifacts, not only deteriorating the quality and
resolution of conventional brightness mode (B-mode) images, hence limiting
their clinical usability, but also impairing other ultrasound modalities such
as elastography and spatial SoS reconstructions, which rely on faithfully
beamformed images as their input. In this work, we propose an analytical method
for estimating BF SoS. We show that pixel-wise relative shifts between frames
beamformed with an assumed SoS is a function of geometric disparities of the
transmission paths and the error in such SoS assumption. Using this relation,
we devise an analytical model, the closed form solution of which yields the
difference between the assumed and the true SoS in the medium. Based on this,
we correct the BF SoS, which can also be applied iteratively. Both in
simulations and experiments, lateral B-mode resolution is shown to be improved
by $\approx$25% compared to that with an initial SoS assumption error of 3.3%
(50 m/s), while localization artifacts from beamforming are also corrected.
After 5 iterations, our method achieves BF SoS errors of under 0.6 m/s in
simulations and under 1 m/s in experimental phantom data. Residual time-delay
errors in beamforming 32 numerical phantoms are shown to reduce down to 0.07
$\mu$s, with average improvements of up to 21 folds compared to initial
inaccurate assumptions. We additionally show the utility of the proposed method
in imaging local SoS maps, where using our correction method reduces
reconstruction root-mean-square errors substantially, down to their lower-bound
with actual BF SoS.

enhancement (LLE). Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that
is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS)
network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect
the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes
with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE
network (SSLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS
auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate
embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate
layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE.
SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks
to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating
training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike
currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the
semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby
leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Comparisons between the
proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the
superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable

Current parallelization approaches for state-of-art Datalogs target

  In this paper, we describe a new approach to data-parallel structured
deduction that involves a key semantic extension of Datalog to permit
first-class facts and higher-order relations via defunctionalization, an
implementation approach that enables parallelism uniformly both across sets of
disjoint facts and over individual facts with nested structure. We detail a
core language, $DL_s$, whose key invariant (subfact closure) ensures that each
subfact is materialized as a top-class fact. We extend $DL_s$ to Slog, a
fully-featured language whose forms facilitate leveraging subfact closure to
rapidly implement expressive, high-performance formal systems. We demonstrate
Slog by building a family of control-flow analyses from abstract machines,
systematically, along with several implementations of classical type systems

impressed onto the printed circuit geometry and the induced surface current

existing solutions heavily rely on unrealistic prior assumptions to avoid

degenerate solutions and thereby obtain smoother and more realistic matchings,
even when using only a one-dimensional feature descriptor. Overall, our method
finds globally optimal and continuous 2D-3D matchings, has the same asymptotic
complexity as previous solutions, produces state-of-the-art results for shape

prediction, route planning, and many others when dealing with networks of

resources during deployment and maintenance. Currently existing approaches
using machine learning are limited to the spatial locations where data was
observed, causing limitations to downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent surge
of Graph Neural Networks for spatio-temporal data processing, we investigate
whether these can also forecast the state of locations with no sensors

Unobserved Node States (FUNS), that allows forecasting the state at entirely

inductive bias. FUNS serves as a blueprint for optimizing models only on

exploits spatio-temporal correlations with surrounding observed locations by
using the network's graph structure. Our employed model builds on a previous

performance of a Self-Propelled Swimming (SPS) body. We consider a thin flat
plate of length $L$ with an egg-carton roughness texture undergoing undulatory
swimming kinematics at the typically observed biological Strouhal number of
$0.3$, amplitude to length ratio of $0.1$, and Reynolds number of $12,000$. As
the roughness wavelength, $\lambda$ is decreased, we find that the undulation
wave speed $\zeta$ must be increased to maintain SPS. We find that large
wavelength roughness results in the formation of horseshoe vortices around each
element while smaller wavelengths result in large leading-edge vortices that
dominate the flow field and the wake. Generally, increasing the wave speed
$\zeta$ increases the power and side forces required to maintain SPS. However,
when $\lambda\approx L/16$ there is a dramatic increase in the enstrophy
(within the flow) that is not reflected in the forces on the body. The
enstrophy increases when $\lambda$ is equivalent to the boundary layer
thickness, a scaling known to amplify vorticity within the boundary layers.
This indicates an interaction between the roughness and kinematics beyond a
simple increase in viscous drag. Finally, we find that all but the longest
roughness wavelength decreases the power required and reduces the RMS amplitude
of the forces when compared to a smooth plate undergoing identical kinematics.
This study reveals the nonlinear interaction between roughness and motion,
illustrating that roughness studies on static shapes do not transfer directly
to unsteady swimmers.

morphing and transport of objects. To do this, we create dissipative kirigami
with suitably patterned viscoelasticity. These kirigami shape-change into
different textures depending on how fast they are stretched. We find that if we
stretch fast and wait, the viscoelastic kirigami can eventually snap from one
texture to another. Crucially, such a snapping instability occurs in a sequence
and a travelling overdamped kink emerges. We demonstrate that such kink
underpins dynamic shape morphing in 2D kirigami and can be used to transport
objects. Our results open avenues for the use of slow kinks in metamaterials,
soft robotics and biomimicry.

existing works have only considered encoding sequential event history into
event representation and ignored the information from the latent graph
structure. Besides they also suffer from poor model explainability, i.e.,
failing to uncover causal influence across a wide variety of nodes. To address
these problems, we propose a Graph Regularized Point Process (GRPP) that can be
decomposed into: 1) a graph propagation model that characterizes the event
interactions across nodes with neighbors and inductively learns node
representations; 2) a temporal attentive intensity model, whose excitation and
time decay factors of past events on the current event are constructed via the
contextualization of the node embedding. Moreover, by applying a graph
regularization method, GRPP provides model interpretability by uncovering
influence strengths between nodes. Numerical experiments on various datasets
show that GRPP outperforms existing models on both the propagation time and

considerable progress has been made, such node interaction paradigms still have
the following limitation. First, the scalability limitation precludes the broad
application of GNNs in large-scale industrial settings since the node
interaction among rapidly expanding neighbors incurs high computation and
memory costs. Second, the over-smoothing problem restricts the discrimination
ability of nodes, i.e., node representations of different classes will converge
to indistinguishable after repeated node interactions. In this work, we propose
a novel hop interaction paradigm to address these limitations simultaneously.
The core idea is to convert the interaction target among nodes to pre-processed
multi-hop features inside each node. We design a simple yet effective HopGNN
framework that can easily utilize existing GNNs to achieve hop interaction.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-task learning strategy with a self-supervised

density functional theory without the use of the theorems of density functional
theory. Instead, a free energy is obtained from a partition function that is
constructed directly from a Hamiltonian, so that the results are, in principle,
valid at finite temperatures. The main governing equations are found to be a
set of modified diffusion equations, and the set of self-consistent equations
are essentially identical to those of a ring polymer system. The equations are
shown to be equivalent to Kohn-Sham density functional theory, and to reduce to
classical density functional theory, each under appropriate conditions. The
obtained non-interacting kinetic energy functional is, in principle, exact, but
suffers from the usual orbital-free approximation of the Pauli exclusion
principle in additional to the exchange-correlation approximation. The
equations are solved using the spectral method of polymer self-consistent field
theory, which allows the set of modified diffusion equations to be evaluated
for the same computational cost as solving a single diffusion equation. A
simple exchange-correlation functional is chosen, together with a
shell-structure-based Pauli potential, in order to compare the ensemble average
electron densities of several isolated atom systems to known literature
results. The agreement is excellent, justifying the alternative formalism and
numerical method. Some speculation is provided on considering the time-like
parameter in the diffusion equations, which is related to temperature, as
having dimensional significance, and thus picturing point-like quantum
particles instead as non-local, polymer-like, threads in a higher dimensional
thermal-space. A consideration of the double-slit experiment from this point of
view is speculated to provide results equivalent to the Copenhagen
interpretation.

collaborative regularization (SSCR) framework that provides noise-robust
reconstructions with a minimal number of measurements. Using Bayesian
inference, we design joint regularizations of the estimated signal, the 3D
voxel-based representation of the objects, and the 2D surface-based description
of the targets. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines
regularizations in mixed dimensions for hidden targets. Experiments on
synthetic and experimental datasets illustrated the efficiency and robustness
of the proposed method under both confocal and non-confocal settings. We report
the reconstruction of the hidden targets with complex geometric structures with
only $5 \times 5$ confocal measurements from public datasets, indicating an
acceleration of the conventional measurement process by a factor of 10000.
Besides, the proposed method enjoys low time and memory complexities with
sparse measurements. Our approach has great potential in real-time
non-line-of-sight imaging applications such as rescue operations and autonomous

The recent development of single-camera-one-shot techniques for hyperspectral
imaging allows multiple spectral bands to be captured simultaneously (3x3, 4x4

intraoperative imaging, agricultural field inspection and food quality
assessment. To capture images across a wide spectrum range, i.e. to achieve
high spectral resolution, the sensor design sacrifices spatial resolution. With
increasing mosaic size, this effect becomes increasingly detrimental.
Furthermore, demosaicing is challenging. Without incorporating edge, shape, and
object information during interpolation, chromatic artifacts are likely to
appear in the obtained images. Recent approaches use neural networks for
demosaicing, enabling direct information extraction from image data. However,
obtaining training data for these approaches poses a challenge as well. This
work proposes a parallel neural network based demosaicing procedure trained on
a new ground truth dataset captured in a controlled environment by a
hyperspectral snapshot camera with a 4x4 mosaic pattern. The dataset is a
combination of real captured scenes with images from publicly available data
adapted to the 4x4 mosaic pattern. To obtain real world ground-truth data, we
performed multiple camera captures with 1-pixel shifts in order to compose the
entire data cube. Experiments show that the proposed network outperforms
state-of-art networks.

  immunity","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.10330",,,,"math.DS math.AP q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the simple epidemiological SIS model for a general heterogeneous
population introduced by Lajmanovich and Yorke (1976) in finite dimension, and
its infinite dimensional generalization we introduced in previous works. In
this model the basic reproducing number $R_0$ is given by the spectral radius
of an integral operator. If $R_0>1$, then there exists a maximal endemic
equilibrium. In this very general heterogeneous SIS model, we prove that
vaccinating according to the profile of this maximal endemic equilibrium
ensures herd immunity. Moreover, this vaccination strategy is critical: the
resulting effective reproduction number is exactly equal to one. As an
application, we estimate that if $R_0 = 2$ in an age-structured community with
mixing rates fitted to social activity, applying this strategy would require
approximately 29% less vaccine doses than the strategy which consists in
vaccinating uniformly a proportion $1 - 1/R_0$ of the population.
  From a dynamical systems point of view, we prove that the non-maximality of
an equilibrium $g$ is equivalent to its linear instability in the original
dynamics, and to the linear instability of the disease-free state in the
modified dynamics where we vaccinate according to $g$.

images with a few annotated support samples. Currently, few-shot segmentation
methods mainly focus on leveraging foreground information without fully
utilizing the rich background information, which could result in wrong
activation of foreground-like background regions with the inadaptability to
dramatic scene changes of support-query image pairs. Meanwhile, the lack of
detail mining mechanism could cause coarse parsing results without some
semantic components or edge areas since prototypes have limited ability to cope
with large object appearance variance. To tackle these problems, we propose a
progressively dual prior guided few-shot semantic segmentation network.
Specifically, a dual prior mask generation (DPMG) module is firstly designed to
suppress the wrong activation in foreground-background comparison manner by
regarding background as assisted refinement information. With dual prior masks
refining the location of foreground area, we further propose a progressive
semantic detail enrichment (PSDE) module which forces the parsing model to
capture the hidden semantic details by iteratively erasing the high-confidence
foreground region and activating details in the rest region with a hierarchical
structure. The collaboration of DPMG and PSDE formulates a novel few-shot
segmentation network that can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Comprehensive
experiments on PASCAL-5i and MS COCO powerfully demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm achieves the great performance.

biomarker discovery. However, contemporary parametric-free and parametric DR
techniques suffer from several significant shortcomings, such as the inability
to preserve global and local features and the pool generalization performance.
On the other hand, regarding explainability, it is crucial to comprehend the
embedding process, especially the contribution of each part to the embedding
process, while understanding how each feature affects the embedding results
that identify critical components and help diagnose the embedding process. To
address these problems, we have developed a deep neural network method called
EVNet, which provides not only excellent performance in structural
maintainability but also explainability to the DR therein. EVNet starts with
data augmentation and a manifold-based loss function to improve embedding
performance. The explanation is based on saliency maps and aims to examine the
trained EVNet parameters and contributions of components during the embedding
process. The proposed techniques are integrated with a visual interface to help
the user to adjust EVNet to achieve better DR performance and explainability.
The interactive visual interface makes it easier to illustrate the data
features, compare different DR techniques, and investigate DR. An in-depth
experimental comparison shows that EVNet consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in both performance measures and explainability.

centres as they lead to data loss and system crashes. Timely predictions of
memory failures allow for taking preventive measures such as server migration
and memory replacement. Thereby, memory failure prediction prevents failures
from externalizing, and it is a vital task to improve system reliability. In
this paper, we revisited the problem of memory failure prediction. We analyzed
the correctable errors (CEs) from hardware logs as indicators for a degraded
memory state. As memories do not always work with full occupancy, access to
faulty memory parts is time distributed. Following this intuition, we observed
that important properties for memory failure prediction are distributed through
long time intervals. In contrast, related studies, to fit practical
constraints, frequently only analyze the CEs from the last fixed-size time
interval while ignoring the predating information. Motivated by the observed
discrepancy, we study the impact of including the overall (long-range) CE
evolution and propose novel features that are calculated incrementally to
preserve long-range properties. By coupling the extracted features with machine
learning methods, we learn a predictive model to anticipate upcoming failures
three hours in advance while improving the average relative precision and
recall for 21% and 19% accordingly. We evaluated our methodology on real-world
