scalars, we show a transition in the scalar spectra from a $k^{-5/3}$ to a
$k^{-3}$ scaling with the wavenumber $k$, in contrast with those of
single-phase isotropic turbulence. For cases with a mean scalar gradient in the
horizontal direction, the scalar spectrum decays faster than $k^{-3}$ at high
wavenumbers. While the $k^{-3}$ scaling is well established in the bubbly flow
velocity spectrum, the scalar spectrum behaviour is not fully understood. We
find that the transition length scale of the scalar spectra is comparable to or
below the bubble diameter and decreases with the molecular diffusivity of the
scalar in the liquid. We use DNS to compute the scalar spectra budget and show
that the scalar fluctuations are produced by the mean scalar gradient at length
scales above the bubble diameter, contrary to the velocity fluctuations. At
length scales below the bubble diameter, the net scalar transfer scales as
$k^{-1}$ inducing the $k^{-3}$ scaling of the scalar spectra. This finding is
consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Dung et al. (2023) about the
physical mechanism behind the $k^{-3}$ scaling. We also show dependencies of
the bubble suspension's convective scalar diffusivity on the gas volume
fraction and molecular diffusivity that differs based on the direction of the
mean scalar gradient. For a mean scalar gradient in the vertical direction, we
find and qualitatively explain a significant effect of the molecular
diffusivity in the gas on the convective scalar diffusivity.

study the avalanche dynamics. However, the cortical networks have distinct
non-random features and spatial organization that is known to affect the
critical exponents. Here we show that distinct empirical exponents arise in
networks with different topology and depend on the network size. In particular,
we find apparent scale-free behavior with mean-field exponents appearing as
quasi-critical dynamics in structured networks. This quasi-critical dynamics
cannot be easily discriminated from an actual critical point in small networks.
We find that the local coalescence in activity dynamics can explain the
distinct exponents. Therefore, both topology and system size should be

GCondNet, a general approach to enhance neural networks by leveraging implicit

exploits the data's high-dimensionality, and thus improves the performance of
an underlying predictor network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on nine real-world datasets, where GCondNet outperforms 14 standard and
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that GCondNet is robust and can be
applied to any small sample-size and high-dimensional tabular learning task.

to prevent controlled dynamical systems from violating constraints and so are
playing an increasingly important role in aerospace, robotic, and other
engineering applications. Here we present a novel reference governor design for
systems whose polynomial constraints depend on unknown bounded parameters. This
is a significant departure from earlier treatments of reference governors,
where the constraints were linear or known, because here we transfer the
uncertainties into the constraints instead of having them in the closed loop
dynamics, which greatly simplifies the task of determining future evolution of
the constraints. Unlike our earlier treatment of reference governors with
polynomial constraints, which transformed the constraints into linear ones that
depend on an augmented state of the system, here we transform the constraints
into linear ones that depend on both the system's state and uncertain
parameters. Convexity allows us to compute the maximal output admissible set
for an uncertain pre-stabilized linear system. We show that it is sufficient to
only consider the extreme values of the uncertain parameters when computing and
propagating the polynomial constraints. We illustrate our method using an
uncertain longitudinal dynamics for civilian aircraft, which is controlled
using a disturbance compensation method and needs to satisfy input and state
constraints, and where our reference governor method ensures that safety
constraints are always satisfied.

scale, the thermo-fluidic governing equations have been extensively modeled in
the literature to understand the meltpool conditions and the thermal gradients
in its vicinity. In many phenomena governed by partial differential equations,
dimensional analysis and identification of important dimensionless numbers can
provide significant insights into the process dynamics. In this context, a
novel strategy using dimensional analysis and the method of linear least

First, the governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method, and
the model predictions are validated by comparing with experimentally estimated
cooling rates, and with numerical results from the literature. Then, through
dimensional analysis, an important dimensionless quantity - interpreted as a
measure of heat absorbed by the powdered material and the meltpool, is
identified. This dimensionless measure of heat absorbed, along with classical
dimensionless quantities such as Peclet, Marangoni, and Stefan numbers, is used
to investigate advective transport in the meltpool for different alloys.
Further, the framework is used to study the variations of thermal gradients and
the solidification cooling rate. Important correlations linking meltpool
morphology and microstructure evolution related variables with classical
dimensionless numbers are the key contribution of this work.

In contrast to s-wave systems, p-wave scattering exhibits an additional
resonance at weak attraction from a quasi-bound state at positive energies,
which leads to a pronounced dip in the shear viscosity at specific

provide a hint of a ~2-4% frequency dependence in the CMB power spectrum, which

and $\xi$ Boo B in terms of both abundance and isotopic ratio is presented. We
obtained new $R$=130\,000 spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per pixel
of up to 3200 using the 11.8m LBT and PEPSI. From fits with synthetic line
profiles based on 1D-LTE MARCS model atmospheres and 3D-NLTE corrections, we
determine the abundances of both isotopes. For $\xi$ Boo A, we find A(Li) =
2.40$\pm$0.03\,dex and $^6$Li/$^7$Li < 1.5$\pm$1.0\,\%\ in 1D-LTE, which
increases to $\approx$2.45 for the 3D-NLTE case. For $\xi$ Boo B we obtain
A(Li) = 0.37$\pm$0.09\,dex in 1D-LTE with an unspecified $^6$Li/$^7$Li level.
Therefore, no $^6$Li is seen on any of the two stars. We consider a spot model
for the Li fit for $\xi$ Boo B and find A(Li) = 0.45$\pm$0.09\,dex. The $^7$Li
abundance is 23 times higher for $\xi$ Boo A than the Sun's, but three times
lower than the Sun's for $\xi$ Boo B while both fit the trend of single stars
in the similar-aged M35 open cluster. Effective temperatures are redetermined
from the TiO band head strength. We note that the best-fit global metallicities
are --0.13$\pm$0.01\,dex for $\xi$ Boo A but +0.13$\pm$0.02\,dex for $\xi$ Boo
B. Lithium abundance for the K5V benchmark star 61\,Cyg\,A was obtained to
A(Li)$\approx$0.53\,dex when including a spot model but to $\approx$0.15\,dex
without a spot model.

analyses - analysing the data at certain specified points, generally

  It is possible that the advantages of multi-arm trials over single-arm trials
may be enhanced further by considering the allocation ratio, R. For an R:1
allocation ratio, Rn patients are allocated to the control arm and n patients
allocated to each active treatment arm. In this study, the optimal allocation
ratio will be defined as the allocation ratio which results in the smallest
total sample size satisfying some required power and probability of type I
error. This is an intuitive definition in the context of clinical trials, as a
smaller trial will in general be more ethical and less expensive than a larger
one satisfying the same error rates. The purpose of this paper is to
investigate the optimal allocation ratio in the case of multiple active
treatment arms.
  The setup for a single stage trial with K active treatment arms is described
in Section 2, along with a brief exposition of Dunnett's statement regarding
the optimal allocation ratio in such circumstances. Equations for type I error
and power are derived, and the methodology used to investigate how total sample
size may be minimised using allocation ratio is described. A two-stage trial is
then considered, using the same methodology. Figures and tables showing how
total sample size changes with allocation ratio, for a range of type I error

the RIS deliver information simultaneously, where the RIS information is
carried through the RIS phase shifts embedded in reflected signals. We
introduce the coded modulation technique at the Tx and the RIS. The main
challenge of the SAPIT scheme is to simultaneously detect the Tx signals and
the RIS phase coefficients at the receiver. To address this challenge, we
introduce appropriate auxiliary variables to convert the original signal model
into two linear models with respect to the Tx signals and one entry-by-entry
bilinear model with respect to the RIS phase coefficients. With this auxiliary
signal model, we develop a message-passing-based receiver algorithm.
Furthermore, we analyze the fundamental performance limit of the proposed
SAPIT-MIMO transceiver. Notably, we establish the state evolution to predict
the receiver performance in a large-size system. We further analyze the
achievable rates of the Tx and the RIS, which provides insight into the code
design for sum-rate maximization. Numerical results validate our analysis and
show that the SAPIT scheme outperforms the passive beamforming counterpart in
achievable sum rate of the Tx and the RIS.

the $\Delta\chi^2$, which compares the $\chi^2$ of the fit with the new physics

Wilks's theorem. This paper uses toy models to explore the properties of
$\Delta\chi^2$ as a test statistic for oscillating functions. The statistics of
such models are shown to deviate from Wilks's theorem. Tests for new physics
also often examine data subsets for ``tension'' called the ``parameter goodness
of fit''. In this paper, we explain this approach and use toy models to examine
the validity of the probabilities from this test also. Although we have chosen
a specific scenario -- neutrino oscillations -- to illustrate important points,
students should keep in mind that these points are widely applicable when
fitting multiple data sets to complex functions.

selection based on the number of likely RGB stars and the ratio of stars above

Monte Carlo simulation of an avalanche inside an RPC, the transition from

resource-hungry, especially when space charge effects become important, which
often coincides with important regimes of operation of these devices. By
modifying the electric field inside the RPC dynamically, the space charge plays
a crucial role in determining the response of the detector. In this work, a
numerical model has been proposed to calculate the dynamic space-charge field
inside an RPC and the same has been implemented in the Garfield++ framework. By
modeling space charge as the large number of line charges and using the
multithreading technique OpenMP to calculate electric field, drift line,
electron gain, and space charge field, it has been possible to maintain time
consumption within reasonable limits. For this purpose, a new class,
pAvalancheMC has been introduced in Garfield++. The calculations have been
successfully verified with those from existing solvers and an example is
provided to show the performance of pAvalancheMC. Moreover, the details of the
transition of an avalanche into a saturated avalanche have been discussed. The

luminosity-dependent spectral and timing features can be analysed in detail.
The XRP GRO J1750-27 recently underwent one of such episodes, during which it
was observed with $NuSTAR$ and monitored with $NICER$. Such a data set is
rarely available, as it samples the outburst over more than a month at a
luminosity that is always exceeding ${\sim}5\times10^{37}\,$erg/s. This value
is larger than the typical critical luminosity value, where a radiative shock
is formed above the neutron star's surface. Our data analysis of the joint
spectra returns a highly ($N_H\sim(5-8)\times10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$) absorbed
spectrum showing a K$\alpha$ iron line, a soft blackbody component likely
originating from the inner edge of the accretion disk, and confirms the
discovery of one of the deepest cyclotron lines, at a centroid energy of
${\sim}44\,$keV corresponding to a magnetic field strength of
$4.7\times10^{12}\,$G. This value is independently supported by the best-fit
physical model for spectral formation in accreting XRPs which, in agreement
with recent findings, favours a distance of $14$ kpc and also reflects a
bulk-Comptonization dominated accretion flow. Contrary to theoretical
expectations and observational evidence from other similar sources, the pulse
profiles as observed by $NICER$ through the outburst raise, peak and decay
remain remarkably steady. The $NICER$ spectrum, including the iron K$\alpha$
line best-fit parameters, also remain almost unchanged at all probed outburst
stages, similar to the pulsed fraction behaviour. We argue that all these
phenomena are linked and interpret them as resulting from a saturation effect
of the accretion column's emission, which occurs in the high-luminosity regime.

this work, we seek an alternative framework that is light and effective through
self-supervised learning across different sources of information, particularly
for the commonly accessible item tag information. We use a self-supervision
signal to pair users with the auxiliary information associated with the items
they have interacted with before. To achieve the pairing, we create a proxy
training task. For a given item, the model predicts the correct pairing between
the representations obtained from the users that have interacted with this item
and the assigned tags. This design provides an efficient solution, using the
auxiliary information directly to enhance the quality of user and item
embeddings. User behavior in recommendation systems is driven by the complex
interactions of many factors behind the decision-making processes. To make the
pairing process more fine-grained and avoid embedding collapse, we propose an
intent-aware self-supervised pairing process where we split the user embeddings
into multiple sub-embedding vectors. Each sub-embedding vector captures a
specific user intent via self-supervised alignment with a particular cluster of
tags. We integrate our designed framework with various recommendation models,
demonstrating its flexibility and compatibility. Through comparison with
numerous SOTA methods on seven real-world datasets, we show that our method can
achieve better performance while requiring less training time. This indicates
the potential of applying our approach on web-scale datasets.

across a range of engineering applications. Despite their routine use, due to
the high dimensional parameter space present for most practical applications, a
comprehensive exploration of the available parameter space is often
impractical. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of physics-constrained
deep learning methods to provide an efficient means of exploring
high-dimensional parameter spaces with minimal amounts of data from high
resolution computational fluid dynamic simulations. As a specific application,
we choose the well established problem of a 2D lid driven cavity flow. While
giving an extensive treatment of the classic case of a square cavity, we extend
the analysis to treat an isosceles trapezoid. In so doing, the number of
parameters determining the solution includes not just the Reynolds number, but
also two additional parameters characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Thus,
together with the $\left( x, y \right)$ variation of the flow and pressure in
configuration space, the presence of these three parameters results in the
solution varying in a 5D space. It is shown that in the absence of data,
physics-constrained methods are able to provide an accurate description of the
cavity flow in this 5D space up to intermediate values of the Reynolds number,
but fails to train for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. In contrast, using a
small quantity of flow data, a single neural network is able to provide an
accurate description for a broad range of Reynolds numbers and cavity
geometries. Once trained, such a model provides a rapid surrogate that can be
used to efficiently explore the 5D space. This 5D surrogate model is
subsequently used to identify critical parameter values for the merger and
splitting of vortices as the Reynolds number and cavity geometry are varied.

plane experienced by photons of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation
when theoretically well-motivated parity-violating extensions of Maxwell
electromagnetism are considered. If the angle, parametrizing such a rotation is
dependent on the photon's direction, then this phenomenon is called Anisotropic
Cosmic Birefringence (ACB). In this paper, we perform for the first time a
tomographic treatment of the ACB, by considering photons emitted both at the
recombination and reionization epoch. This allows one to extract additional and
complementary information about the physical source of cosmic birefringence
with respect to the isotropic case. We focus here on the case of an axion-like
field $\chi$, whose coupling with the electromagnetic sector induces such a
phenomenon, by using an analytical and numerical approach (which involves a
modification of the CLASS code). We find that the anisotropic component of
cosmic birefringence exhibits a peculiar behavior: an increase of the axion
mass implies an enhancement of the anisotropic amplitude, allowing to probe a
wider range of masses with respect to the purely isotropic case. Moreover, we
show that at large angular scales, the interplay between the reionization and
recombination contributions to ACB is sensitive to the axion mass, so that at
sufficiently low multipoles, for sufficiently light masses, the reionization
contribution overtakes the recombination one, making the tomographic approach
to cosmic birefringence a promising tool for investigating the properties of
this axion-like field.

neutral atoms and create energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), which bring
information on the physical state of the plasma within the boundary region of
the heliosphere. The speed of the ENAs depends on their energies, and
consequently observations at different energies provide information on
different epochs backwards in time. Therefore, understanding the history of the
evolution of the SW is important to understand this information. In this paper,
we extend the work by \citet{porowski_etal:22a}, who provided the WawHelioIon

abstract EE dialogue model formalised the interactions between a user and an
XAI system. The resulting EE conversational chatbot is personalised to an XAI
system at run-time using the knowledge captured in its XAI system
specification. This seamless integration is enabled by using Behaviour Trees
(BT) to conceptualise both the EE dialogue model and the explanation
strategies. In the evaluation, we discussed several desirable properties of
using BTs over traditionally used STMs or FSMs. BTs promote the reusability of
dialogue components through the hierarchical nature of the design. Sub-trees
are modular, i.e. a sub-tree is responsible for a specific behaviour, which can
be designed in different levels of granularity to improve human
interpretability. The EE dialogue model consists of abstract behaviours needed
to capture EE, accordingly, it can be implemented as a conversational,
graphical or text-based interface which caters to different domains and users.
There is a significant computational cost when using BTs for modelling
dialogue, which we mitigate by using memory. Overall, we find that the ability
to create robust conversational pathways dynamically makes BTs a good candidate

significant domain gaps as well as a lack of sufficient data for cross-modality

NIR-VIS facial image generation. Specifically, we reconstruct 3D face shape and
reflectance from a large 2D facial dataset and introduce a novel method of
transforming the VIS reflectance to NIR reflectance. We then use a
physically-based renderer to generate a vast, high-resolution and
photorealistic dataset consisting of various poses and identities in the NIR

propose an IDentity-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ID-MMD) loss, which not
only reduces the modality gap between NIR and VIS images at the domain level
but encourages the network to focus on the identity features instead of facial
details, such as poses and accessories. Extensive experiments conducted on four

fragment under their own gravity, they form bound gaseous clumps which may
evolve to become giant planets. Today, the fraction of discs that undergo
fragmentation, and the frequency of conditions that may lead to giant planet
formation via gravitational instability, is still unknown.
  We perform a population synthesis of discs from formation to dispersal. In
varying the infall radius, we study the relationship of the early disc size
with fragmentation. Furthermore, we investigate how stellar accretion heating
affects the fragmentation fraction.
  We find that discs fragment only if they become sufficiently large early in
their lives. This size depends sensitively on where mass is added to the discs
during the collapse of their parent molecular cloud core. By choosing
intermediate infall locations leading to a synthetic disc size distribution
that is in agreement with the observed one, we find a fragmentation fraction
between 0.1 and 11 %, depending on the efficiency of stellar accretion heating
of the discs.
  We conclude that the early disc size is mainly determined by the infall
location during the collapse of the molecular cloud core and controls the
population-wide frequency of fragmentation. Stellar accretion heating plays an
important role for fragmentation and must be studied further. Our work is an
observationally-informed step towards a prediction of the frequency of giant

theoretical studies will deepen our understanding of the formation and early

$3\sigma$-equivalent statistical significance. On average, the CGM of $M_*\sim
10^{10}$ $M_\odot$ star-forming galaxies contains more O VI than the CGM of

Coma and A1367 clusters. To inspect possible secular and environmental

perform a multidimensional analysis by dividing the sample according to (i)
their position in the (NUV-i) vs. M* diagram,(ii) local galaxy density, (iii)
stellar-mass, (iv) halo-mass of the group to which galaxies belong, and (v)
neutral Hydrogen content. We present a new calibration of the optical
diameter-based HI-deficiency parameter employing a reference sample of isolated
galaxies. At intermediate distances between Virgo and Coma, we identify a
ring-like structure of galaxies constituted by three large filaments. The
fraction of HI-deficient galaxies within the filament suggests that filaments
are a transitioning environment between field and cluster in terms of HI
content. We classify the nuclear spectra according to the four-line BPT and the
two-line WHAN diagrams, and investigate the variation in the fraction of AGN
with stellar-mass, as well as their colours and environments. In general, we
observe that the mass-dependency of the fraction of Seyfert nuclei is little
sensitive to the environment, whereas the fraction of star-forming nuclei is a
steeper function of M* in lower-density environments and in blue-cloud
galaxies. We find that the fraction of LINERs depends on galaxy colour and, for
logM* > 9.5-10, increases in galaxies belonging to the green valley.

is compromised due to the long-tail nature of the relationships and their
parent object pairs. Training of the scene graphs is dominated by the majority
relationships of the majority pairs and, therefore, the object-conditional
distributions of relationship in the minority pairs are not preserved after the
training is converged. Consequently, the biased model performs well on more
frequent relationships in the marginal distribution of relationships such as
`on' and `wearing', and performs poorly on the less frequent relationships such
as `eating' or `hanging from'. In this work, we propose virtual evidence
incorporated within-triplet Bayesian Network (BN) to preserve the
object-conditional distribution of the relationship label and to eradicate the
bias created by the marginal probability of the relationships. The insufficient
number of relationships in the minority classes poses a significant problem in
learning the within-triplet Bayesian network. We address this insufficiency by
embedding-based augmentation of triplets where we borrow samples of the
minority triplet classes from its neighborhood triplets in the semantic space.
We perform experiments on two different datasets and achieve a significant
improvement in the mean recall of the relationships. We also achieve better
balance between recall and mean recall performance compared to the SOTA
de-biasing techniques of scene graph models.

test case for radius valley emergence models around early M dwarfs. We confirm
the planetary nature of TOI-1695 b based on five sectors of TESS data and a
suite of follow-up observations including 49 precise radial velocity
measurements taken with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We measure a planetary mass
of $6.36 \pm 1.00\ M_\oplus$, which reveals that TOI-1695 b is inconsistent
with a purely terrestrial composition of iron and magnesium silicate, and
instead is likely a water-rich planet. Our finding that TOI-1695 b is not
terrestrial is inconsistent with the planetary system being sculpted by
thermally driven mass loss. We present a statistical analysis of seven
well-characterized planets within the M dwarf radius valley demonstrating that
a thermally-driven mass loss scenario is unlikely to explain this population.

problem in quantum information processing. Its classical version is a non-local
game played by non-communicating players against a referee. Based on a known
probability distribution, the referee generates one input for each of the
players and keeps one secret value. The players have to guess the referee's
value and win if they all do so. For this game, we investigate the advantage of
no-signalling strategies over classical ones. We show numerically that for
three players and binary values, no-signalling strategies cannot provide any
improvement over classical ones. For a certain LSSD game based on a binary
symmetric channel, we show that no-signalling strategies are strictly better
when multiple simultaneous instances of the game are played. Good classical
strategies for this game can be defined by codes, and good no-signalling
strategies by list-decoding schemes. We expand this example game to a class of
games defined by an arbitrary channel, and extend the idea of using codes and
list decoding to define strategies for multiple simultaneous instances of these
games. Finally, we give an expression for the limit of the exponent of the
classical winning probability, and show that no-signalling strategies based on
list-decoding schemes achieve this limit.

conclusions from predictive models, whether concerned about the prediction at a
given point or any downstream evaluation that uses the model as input. When the
predictive model is simple and its evaluation differentiable, this task is
solved by the delta method, where we propagate the asymptotically-normal
uncertainty in the predictive model through the evaluation to compute standard
errors and Wald confidence intervals. However, this becomes difficult when the
model and/or evaluation becomes more complex. Remedies include the bootstrap,
but it can be computationally infeasible when training the model even once is
costly. In this paper, we propose an alternative, the implicit delta method,
which works by infinitesimally regularizing the training loss of the predictive
model to automatically assess downstream uncertainty. We show that the change
in the evaluation due to regularization is consistent for the asymptotic
variance of the evaluation estimator, even when the infinitesimal change is
approximated by a finite difference. This provides both a reliable
quantification of uncertainty in terms of standard errors as well as permits
the construction of calibrated confidence intervals. We discuss connections to
other approaches to uncertainty quantification, both Bayesian and frequentist,

arithmetic operations. Our leading constant $\frac{15}{4} = 3.75$ is the first
improvement in over 15 years; it improves on the prior best leading constant
$\frac{34}{9} = 3.777\ldots$ by Van Buskirk from 2004, which in turn improved
on the leading constant of $4$ from the split-radix algorithm of Yavne from
1968 and the leading constant of $5$ from the Cooley-Tukey algorithm from 1965.
  Our new WHT algorithm takes advantage of a recent line of work on the
non-rigidity of the WHT: we decompose the WHT matrix as the sum of a low-rank

to achieve a lower operation count. Our new DFT algorithm comes from a novel

learning achieve limited generalization at the cost of data-intensive training,

this study, we explore the viability of developing purely-neural controllers

empirical results demonstrate that NeuroCERIL can learn various procedural

causal reasoning procedure is computationally efficient, and that its memory
use is dominated by highly transient short-term memories, much like human

number of qubits employed in the calculations at minimum. However, the use of
minimal basis sets leads to very large errors in the computed molecular
energies as well as potential energy surface shapes. One way to increase the
accuracy of electronic structure calculations is through the development of
small basis sets better suited for quantum computing. In this work, we show
that the use of adaptive basis sets, in which exponents and contraction
coefficients depend on molecular structure, provide an easy way to dramatically
improve the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations without the need to
increase the basis set size and thus the number of qubits utilized in quantum
circuits. As a proof of principle, we optimize an adaptive minimal basis set
for quantum computing calculations on an H$_2$ molecule, in which exponents and
contraction coefficients depend on the H-H distance, and apply it to the
generation of H$_2$ potential energy surface on IBM-Q quantum devices. The
adaptive minimal basis set reaches the accuracy of the double-zeta basis sets,

Rule of Signs and Newton's Polygon Rule can both be interpreted as
multiplicities of polynomials over hyperfields. Hyperfields are a
generalization of fields which encode things like the arithmetic of signs or of
absolute values. By looking at multiplicities of polynomials over such
algebras, Baker and Lorscheid showed that you can recover the rules of
Descartes and Newton.
  In this paper, we define tropical extensions for idylls. Such extensions have
appeared for semirings with negation symmetries in the work of
Akian-Gaubert-Guterman and for hypergroups and hyperfields in the work of
Bowler-Su. Examples of tropical extensions are extending the tropical
hyperfield to higher ranks, or extending the hyperfield of signs to the
tropical real hyperfield by including a valuation.
  The results of this paper concern the interaction of multiplicities and
tropical extensions. First, there is a lifting theorem from initial forms to
the entire polynomial from which we will show that multiplicities for a
polynomial are equal to the corresponding multiplicity for some initial form.
Second, we show that tropical extensions preserve the property that the sum of
all multiplicities is bounded by the degree. Consequentially, we have this
degree bound for every stringent hyperfield. This gives a partial answer to a
question posed by Baker and Lorscheid about which hyperfields have this
property.

important to understand how the particle and heat fluxes at the wall may impact
the wall material and affect electrode degradation. Simulations are performed
using the 1X-1V Boltzmann-Poisson system for a proton-electron plasma in the
presence of bias potentials ranging from 0 to 10 kV. The results indicate that
the sheath near the high potential wall remains generally the same as that of a
classical sheath without the presence of a bias potential. However, the sheath
near the low potential wall becomes more prominent with a larger potential
drop, a significant decrease of electron density, and larger sheath lengths.
The spatially constant current density increases to a saturation value with
increasing bias potential. The current is dominated by the ions at the low
potential wall and by the electrons at the high potential wall. The heat flux
increases to a saturation value at the high potential wall and tends to zero at
the low potential wall with increasing bias potential. The results trend with
theory with differences attributed to the simplified assumptions in the theory
and the kinetic effects considered in the simulations. Due to the significant
computational cost of a well resolved 1X-2V simulation, only one such

by observing the ability of convolutional image classification models to
autoencode the model's input using embeddings existing in various layers. We
find that the deeper the layer, the less accurate that layer's representation
of the input is before training. Inaccurate representation results from
non-uniqueness in which various distinct inputs give approximately the same
embedding. Non-unique representation is a consequence of both exact and
approximate non-invertibility of transformations present in the forward pass.
Learning to classify natural images leads to an increase in representation
clarity for early but not late layers, which instead form abstract images.
Rather than simply selecting for features present in the input necessary for
classification, deep layer representations are found to transform the input so
that it matches representations of the training data such that arbitrary inputs
are mapped to manifolds learned during training. This work provides support for
the theory that the tasks of image recognition and input generation are
inseparable even for models trained exclusively to classify.

superconductors, the cuprates and fullerides, which are expected to have
next-nearest neighbor hopping and interactions. We determine pair properties
for a dilute extended Hubbard model with large Hubbard $U$ and both near- and
next-nearest neighbor hopping and attraction, on a range of lattices using both
numerical and analytical approaches. We find that the presence of next-nearest
neighbor hopping, $t'$ and near- and next-nearest neighbor attraction ($V$ and
$V'$) very significantly lowers the pair mass in a wide range of lattices. The
pair mass decreases with increased $t'$ and $V'$ (where it has a minimum when
$V'=V$). Transition temperatures are estimated for the Bose-Einstein
condensation of pairs leading to superconductivity. The presence of both $t'$
and $V'$ leads ubiquitously to small strongly bound pairs with an inverse mass

In this paper, we argue why a singular definition of XAI is neither feasible

lenses of Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) to explicate how diverse
stakeholders (relevant social groups) have different interpretations

research is to aid organizations in making informed choices on security
controls to defend against cyberthreats through an investigation of adversarial

extent of mitigation of 298 NIST SP800-53 controls over 188 adversarial
techniques used in 669 cybercrime groups and malware cataloged in the MITRE
ATT\&CK framework based upon an existing mapping between the controls and
techniques. We identify that, based on the mapping, only 101 out of 298 control

that 53 adversarial techniques cannot be mitigated by any existing controls,
and these techniques primarily aid adversaries in bypassing system defense and
discovering targeted system information. We identify a set of 20 critical
controls that can mitigate 134 adversarial techniques, and on average, can
mitigate 72\% of all techniques used by 98\% of the cataloged adversaries in
MITRE ATT\&CK. We urge organizations, that do not have any controls enforced in

dynamical billiards, or crystallization dynamics to realistic pedestrian
collective behaviors, including lane and strip formation for counter and

description of pedestrian dynamics as the Hamiltonian turns out to be a generic
order parameter that allows us to identify specific behaviours of the dynamics
from a macroscopic viewpoint. Particular cases even enable through energy
balance to determine the Hamiltonian behavior without requiring the tedious
computation of the microscopic dynamics. Using PHS theory, we systematically
identify a critical threshold value for the Hamiltonian, which relies only on

consistent solutions from these methods as the time-step size is reduced. To
overcome this issue, we propose a consistent method that is based on a new
definition of $\tau_{\mathrm{SUPG}}$. The new method that is implemented on top
of SUPG/PSPG stabilized formulation involves the replacement of the time-step

three cases: a steady pipe flow, an external flow over a square obstacle, and a
blood flow through a patient-specific anatomy. These numerical experiments show
that, in contrast to the conventional method, our proposed formulation remains
consistent with regard to the time-step size. On the other hand, the proposed
method produces a stiffer linear system that degrades the convergence of the

Explaining time-series predictive models is useful for clinical applications
with high stakes to understand the behavior of prediction models. However,
existing approaches to explain such models are frequently unique to data where
the features do not have a time-varying component. In this paper, we introduce
WindowSHAP, a model-agnostic framework for explaining time-series classifiers
using Shapley values. We intend for WindowSHAP to mitigate the computational
complexity of calculating Shapley values for long time-series data as well as
improve the quality of explanations. WindowSHAP is based on partitioning a
sequence into time windows. Under this framework, we present three distinct
algorithms of Stationary, Sliding and Dynamic WindowSHAP, each evaluated
against baseline approaches, KernelSHAP and TimeSHAP, using perturbation and
sequence analyses metrics. We applied our framework to clinical time-series
data from both a specialized clinical domain (Traumatic Brain Injury - TBI) as
well as a broad clinical domain (critical care medicine). The experimental
results demonstrate that, based on the two quantitative metrics, our framework
is superior at explaining clinical time-series classifiers, while also reducing
the complexity of computations. We show that for time-series data with 120 time
steps (hours), merging 10 adjacent time points can reduce the CPU time of
WindowSHAP by 80% compared to KernelSHAP. We also show that our Dynamic
WindowSHAP algorithm focuses more on the most important time steps and provides
more understandable explanations. As a result, WindowSHAP not only accelerates
the calculation of Shapley values for time-series data, but also delivers more
understandable explanations with higher quality.

solutions, and different regularization strategies impose different types of
restrictions. In this paper, we present a multilevel regularization strategy
that constructs and trains a hierarchy of neural networks, each of which has

encourage the neural networks to build a hierarchical understanding of the

training agents to perform difficult-to-specify tasks. However, human feedback
can be noisy, particularly when human teachers lack relevant knowledge or
experience. Levels of expertise vary across teachers, and a given teacher may
have differing levels of expertise for different components of a task. RLHF
algorithms that learn from multiple teachers therefore face an expertise
problem: the reliability of a given piece of feedback depends both on the
teacher that it comes from and how specialized that teacher is on relevant
components of the task. Existing state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms assume that
all evaluations come from the same distribution, obscuring this inter- and
intra-human variance, and preventing them from accounting for or taking
advantage of variations in expertise. We formalize this problem, implement it
as an extension of an existing RLHF benchmark, evaluate the performance of a
state-of-the-art RLHF algorithm, and explore techniques to improve query and
teacher selection. Our key contribution is to demonstrate and characterize the
expertise problem, and to provide an open-source implementation for testing
future solutions.

subgraphs in undirected graphs. In particular, we provide the following
results. (1) A general framework for maintaining the maximal k-edge-connected
subgraphs upon insertions of edges or vertices, by successively partitioning
the graph into its k-edge-connected components. This defines a decomposition
tree, which can be maintained by using algorithms for the incremental
maintenance of the k-edge-connected components as black boxes at every level of
the tree. (2) As an application of this framework, we provide two algorithms
for the incremental maintenance of the maximal $3$-edge-connected subgraphs.
These algorithms allow for vertex and edge insertions, interspersed with
queries asking whether two vertices belong to the same maximal
$3$-edge-connected subgraph. The first algorithm has $O(m\alpha(m,n) +
n^2\log^2 n)$ total running time and uses $O(n)$ space, where $m$ is the number
of edge insertions and queries, and $n$ is the total number of vertices
inserted. The second algorithm performs the same operations in faster
$O(m\alpha(m,n) + n^2\alpha(n,n))$ time in total, using $O(n^2)$ space. (3) We
provide efficient constructions of sparse subgraphs that have the same maximal
k-edge-connected subgraphs as the original graph. These are useful in speeding
up computations involving the maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs in dense

$O(m+k^{O(1)}n\sqrt{n}\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ and
$O(m+k^{O(k)}n\sqrt{n}\log{n})$, respectively. (5) A fully dynamic algorithm

options, while optimization is applied to resolve demand-capacity imbalances by
means of a mathematical programming model that judiciously assigns a feasible
4D trajectory and a possible ground delay to each flight. The methodology has
been tested on instances extracted from real air traffic data repositories.
With more than 32,000 flights considered, we solve the largest instances of the
ATFM problem available in the literature in short computational times that are
reasonable from the practical point of view. As a by-product, we highlight the
trade-off between preferences and delays as well as the potential benefits.
Indeed, computing efficient solutions of the problem facilitates a consensus

pitfalls of hand-crafted reward functions by distilling them from human

work, we demonstrate that encoding environment dynamics in the reward function
(REED) dramatically reduces the number of preference labels required in
state-of-the-art preference-based RL frameworks. We hypothesize that REED-based
methods better partition the state-action space and facilitate generalization
to state-action pairs not included in the preference dataset. REED iterates
between encoding environment dynamics in a state-action representation via a
self-supervised temporal consistency task, and bootstrapping the
preference-based reward function from the state-action representation. Whereas
prior approaches train only on the preference-labelled trajectory pairs, REED
exposes the state-action representation to all transitions experienced during
policy training. We explore the benefits of REED within the PrefPPO [1] and
PEBBLE [2] preference learning frameworks and demonstrate improvements across
experimental conditions to both the speed of policy learning and the final
policy performance. For example, on quadruped-walk and walker-walk with 50

recovered. For some domains, REED-based reward functions result in policies

as capillaries, is crucial in applications such as microfluidics, two-phase

becomes challenging because evaporation triggers complex spatio-temporal
changes in the composition of the mixture. These changes in composition, in
turn, affect evaporation. In the present work, we study the evaporation of
aqueous glycerol solutions contained as a liquid column in a capillary tube.
Experiments and one-dimensional simulations show three evaporation regimes
characterised by different time evolutions of the normalised mass transfer rate
(or Sherwood number, $Sh$), namely $Sh (\tilde{t}) = 1$, $Sh \sim
1/\sqrt{\tilde{t}}$, and $Sh \sim \exp\left(-\tilde{t}\right)$. Here
$\tilde{t}$ is a normalised time. We present a simplistic analytical model
which shows that the evaporation dynamics can be expressed by the classical
relation $Sh = \exp \left( \tilde{t} \right) \mathrm{erfc} \left(
\sqrt{\tilde{t}}\right)$. For small and medium $\tilde{t}$, this expression
results in the first and second of the three observed scaling regimes,
respectively. This analytical model is formulated in the limit of pure
diffusion and when the penetration depth $\delta(t)$ of the diffusion front is
much smaller than the length $L(t)$ of the liquid column. When $\delta \approx
L$, finite length effects lead to $Sh \sim \exp\left(-\tilde{t}\right)$, i.e.
the third regime. Finally, we extend our analytical model to incorporate the
effect of advection and determine the conditions under which this effect is
important. Our results provide fundamental insight into the physics of

However, the Fisher matrix only provides a reasonable approximation to the true
likelihood when data are nearly Gaussian distributed and observables have
nearly linear dependence on the parameters of interest. Also, Fisher
forecasting techniques alone cannot be used to assess their own validity.
Thorough sampling of the exact or mock likelihood can definitively determine
whether a Fisher forecast is valid, though such sampling is often prohibitively

two-dimensional slices of level surfaces of the DALI approximation to the

including planning, robotics, and explanation. Constraint-based structure
learning algorithms such as PC use conditional independence (CI) tests to infer
causal structure. Traditionally, constraint-based algorithms perform CI tests
with a preference for smaller-sized conditioning sets, partially because the
statistical power of conventional CI tests declines rapidly as the size of the
conditioning set increases. However, many modern conditional independence tests
are model-based, and these tests use well-regularized models that maintain
statistical power even with very large conditioning sets. This suggests an
intriguing new strategy for constraint-based algorithms which may result in a
reduction of the total number of CI tests performed: Test variable pairs with
large conditioning sets first, as a pre-processing step that finds some
conditional independencies quickly, before moving on to the more conventional
strategy that favors small conditioning sets. We propose such a pre-processing
step for the PC algorithm which relies on performing CI tests on a few randomly
selected large conditioning sets. We perform an empirical analysis on directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) that correspond to real-world systems and both empirical

Pre-Processing Plus PC (P3PC) performs far fewer CI tests than the original PC

backflow exhibits dramatically different features in two-dimensional systems

this planet, and in order to be consistent with previous studies, we did not

Saturn's perturbation decreases the rate of accretion by scattering many
planetesimals out of Jupiter's accretion zone. It also increases the velocities
with which planetesimals encounter the envelope, which in agreement with our
previous findings, enhances their break-up due to the ram-pressure. Results
also show that, because the effect of Saturn in scattering of planetesimals
increases with its mass, this planet might not have played a significant role
in the accretion of planetesimals by proto-Jupiter during the early stage of
its growth. Finally, the late accretion of planetesimals, as obtained in our

graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown great potential in boosting the
performance of GNNs. Most existing GSL works apply a joint learning framework
where the estimated adjacency matrix and GNN parameters are optimized for
downstream tasks. However, as GSL is essentially a link prediction task, whose
goal may largely differ from the goal of the downstream task. The inconsistency
of these two goals limits the GSL methods to learn the potential optimal graph
structure. Moreover, the joint learning framework suffers from scalability
issues in terms of time and space during the process of estimation and
optimization of the adjacency matrix. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
graph structure refinement (GSR) framework with a pretrain-finetune pipeline.
Specifically, The pre-training phase aims to comprehensively estimate the
underlying graph structure by a multi-view contrastive learning framework with
both intra- and inter-view link prediction tasks. Then, the graph structure is
refined by adding and removing edges according to the edge probabilities
estimated by the pre-trained model. Finally, the fine-tuning GNN is initialized
by the pre-trained model and optimized toward downstream tasks. With the
refined graph structure remaining static in the fine-tuning space, GSR avoids
estimating and optimizing graph structure in the fine-tuning phase which enjoys
great scalability and efficiency. Moreover, the fine-tuning GNN is boosted by
both migrating knowledge and refining graphs. Extensive experiments are
conducted to evaluate the effectiveness (best performance on six benchmark
datasets), efficiency, and scalability (13.8x faster using 32.8% GPU memory
compared to the best GSL baseline on Cora) of the proposed model.

the flight data using the proposed algorithm, and the estimated position is
compared with actual ground truth data. The proposed algorithm doesn't require

of the proposed approach is compared with the current state-of-art GPS-denied

we associated a particular graph G, which we call rSPR graph, with the elements

when a set of rooted binary phylogenetic trees can be embedded in a level-1
network without inferring any additional trees. Lastly, we show how these
conditions translate into a polynomial-time algorithm to reconstruct such a

dialogue systems to endow chatbots the ability to learn continually by
themselves through their own self-initiated interactions with their users and
working environments to improve themselves. As the systems chat more and more

latest developments and techniques for building such continual learning
dialogue systems that continuously learn new language expressions and lexical

external sources, acquire new training examples during conversation, and learn
conversational skills. Apart from these general topics, existing works on

GPS-denied and open field environments for ground and surface robots. However,
due to the frequent perception failures derived from lacking visual texture or
the {swing} of robot view direction on rough terrains, the accuracy and
robustness of vSLAM are still to be enhanced. The study develops a novel view
planning approach of actively perceiving areas with maximal information to
address the mentioned problem; a gimbal camera is used as the main sensor.
Firstly, a map representation based on feature distribution-weighted Fisher
information is proposed to completely and effectively represent environmental
information richness. With the map representation, a continuous environmental
information model is further established to convert the discrete information
space into a continuous one for numerical optimization in real-time.
Subsequently, the receding horizon optimization is utilized to obtain the
optimal informative viewpoints with simultaneously considering the robotic
perception, exploration and motion cost based on the continuous environmental
model. Finally, several simulations and outdoor experiments are performed to
verify the improvement of localization robustness and accuracy by the proposed
approach.

speech applications. Moreover, realistic applications typically involve speech
corrupted by noise and room reverberation, hence models need to provide
representations that are robust to such environmental factors. In this study,
we build on the so-called DistilHuBERT model, which distils HuBERT to a
fraction of its original size, with three modifications, namely: (i) augment
the training data with noise and reverberation, while the student model needs
to distill the clean representations from the teacher model; (ii) introduce a
curriculum learning approach where increasing levels of noise are introduced as
the model trains, thus helping with convergence and with the creation of more
robust representations; and (iii) introduce a multi-task learning approach
where the model also reconstructs the clean waveform jointly with the
distillation task, thus also acting as an enhancement step to ensure additional
environment robustness to the representation. Experiments on three SUPERB tasks
show the advantages of the proposed method not only relative to the original
DistilHuBERT, but also to the original HuBERT, thus showing the advantages of
the proposed method for ``in the wild'' edge speech applications.

upgrade the current premiums of a contract by taking into account
policyholders' attributes and their claim history. Most data-driven models used
for this task are mathematically intractable, and premiums must be then
obtained through numerical methods such as simulation such MCMC. However, these
methods can be computationally expensive and prohibitive for large portfolios
when applied at the policyholder level. Additionally, these computations become
``black-box"" procedures as there is no expression showing how the claim history
of policyholders is used to upgrade their premiums. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes the use of a surrogate modeling approach to
inexpensively derive a closed-form expression for computing the Bayesian
credibility premiums for any given model. As a part of the methodology, the
paper introduces the ``credibility index"", which is a summary statistic of a
policyholder's claim history that serves as the main input of the surrogate
model and that is sufficient for several distribution families, including the
exponential dispersion family. As a result, the computational burden of a
posteriori ratemaking for large portfolios is therefore reduced through the
direct evaluation of the closed-form expression, which additionally can provide
a transparent and interpretable way of computing Bayesian premiums.

driving technologies are key towards the smart city, with convenient urban
mobility and high energy economy performance. However, the global rise in
electricity price provokes renewed interest on CAVs with hybrid electric
powertrains rather than considering battery electric powertrains. This paper
provides a decentralized coordination strategy for a group of connected and
autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with a series hybrid electric (sHEV) powertrain at
signal-free intersections. The problem is formulated as a convex form with
suitable relaxation and approximation of the powertrain model and solved by
decentralized model predictive control, which is able to ensure a rapid search
and unique solution in real time. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness
of the proposed methods concerning physical and safety constraints. By
utilizing the petrol fuel and battery charging prices over the last year, the
performance of the proposed approach is evaluated against the optimal results
produced by two benchmark solutions, conventional vehicles (CVs) and battery
electric vehicles (BEVs). The comparison results show that the traveling cost
of sHEVs approaches and even under some circumstances reaches the same level as
for BEVs, which indicates the importance of hybridization, particularly under
the current rising electricity price situation.

project an input image to the latent space of a NeRF generator and then
synthesize novel views of the original image based on the latent code. Compared
with GAN inversion for 2D generative models, NeRF inversion not only needs to
1) preserve the identity of the input image, but also 2) ensure 3D consistency
in generated novel views. This requires the latent code obtained from the
single-view image to be invariant across multiple views. To address this new
challenge, we propose a two-stage encoder for style-based NeRF inversion. In
the first stage, we introduce a base encoder that converts the input image to a
latent code. To ensure the latent code is view-invariant and is able to
synthesize 3D consistent novel view images, we utilize identity contrastive
learning to train the base encoder. Second, to better preserve the identity of
the input image, we introduce a refining encoder to refine the latent code and
add finer details to the output image. Importantly note that the novelty of
this model lies in the design of its first-stage encoder which produces the
closest latent code lying on the latent manifold and thus the refinement in the
second stage would be close to the NeRF manifold. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed two-stage encoder qualitatively
and quantitatively exhibits superiority over the existing encoders for
inversion in both image reconstruction and novel-view rendering.

post-processing, an essential part of the typical object detection pipeline,
posing a significant bottleneck affecting the performance of traditional object
detection models. The detection transformer (DETR), as the first end-to-end
target detection model, discards the requirement of manual components like the
anchor and non-maximum suppression (NMS), significantly simplifying the target
detection process. However, compared with most traditional object detection
models, DETR converges very slowly, and a query's meaning is obscure. Thus,
inspired by the Step-by-Step concept, this paper proposes a new two-stage
object detection model, named DETR with YOLO (DEYO), which relies on a
progressive inference to solve the above problems. DEYO is a two-stage
architecture comprising a classic target detection model and a DETR-like model
as the first and second stages, respectively. Specifically, the first stage
provides high-quality query and anchor feeding into the second stage, improving
the performance and efficiency of the second stage compared to the original
DETR model. Meanwhile, the second stage compensates for the performance
degradation caused by the first stage detector's limitations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DEYO attains 50.6 AP and 52.1 AP in 12 and 36
epochs, respectively, while utilizing ResNet-50 as the backbone and multi-scale
features on the COCO dataset. Compared with DINO, an optimal DETR-like model,
the developed DEYO model affords a significant performance improvement of 1.6

The edge turbulence is diagnosed in NSTX using the gas puff imaging (GPI)

database study uses a selection of discharges that have a change in the RWM
coil current during the GPI gas puff. We compare the turbulence before and
after this change in the applied non-axisymmetric fields, and compares the
turbulence between the two states. Our findings show that these 3D fields do
not have a strong, statistically significant impact on the average poloidal
size, autocorrelation time, or relative fluctuation levels of the turbulence.
In addition, we find that the displacement of the radial location of the GPI
signal peak intensity is correlated with the shift in the perturbed separatrix
location as predicted by the 3D vacuum magnetic field code MAFOT. We find that
in general the non-axisymmetric fields from the RWM coils locally displace the
edge flux surface as expected even when the self-consistent plasma response is
not included, and that the model reproduces the localized shift observed by

dynamic bandwidth and long propagation, for establishing deterministic
services, it is not only difficult in finding stable end-to-end (E2E) routing,
but also complex for joint routing and scheduling. Towards this, we propose an
optimal solution based on temporal graphs to enhance resource utilization and
service capability of NTNs. First, an extended time-expanded graph (ETEG) with
introduced virtual nodes and edges is constructed to uniformly model both
heterogeneous resources and traffic requirements. Then, we recast the
deterministic routing problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem,
by linearizing the constraints containing variable-dependent summations,
round-down operation and multiplication of nonlinear terms. With the solid
upper bound by ILP-based scheduling, we further propose a low-complexity

perovskites employing the density functional theory (DFT) method. The
mechanical permanence of these two compounds was observed by the Born stability
criteria as well. The band structure of CPTO reveals a 0.88 and 0.46 eV direct
narrow band gap while using GGA-mBJ and GGA-PBE potentials, respectively, which
is an indication of its fascinating semiconducting nature. The calculated
partial density of states indicates the strong hybridization between Pd-4d and
O-2p orbital electrons for CPTO, whereas Pd-4d and V-3d-O-2p for CPVO. The
study of the chemical bonding nature and electronic charge distribution graph
reveals the coexistence of covalent O-V/Pd bonds, ionic O-Ti/Ca bonds, as well
as metallic Ti/V-Ti/V bonding for both compounds. The Fermi surface of CPVO
ensures a kind of hole as well as electron faces simultaneously, indicating the
multifarious band characteristic. The prediction of the static real dielectric
function (optical property) of CPTO at zero energy implies its promising
dielectric nature. The photoconductivity and absorption coefficient of CPBO
display good qualitative compliance with the consequences of band structure
computations. The calculated thermodynamic properties manifest the
thermodynamical stability for CPBO, whereas phonon dispersions of CPVO exhibit
stable phonon dispersion in contrast to slightly unstable phonon dispersion of
CPTO. The predicted Debye temperature ($\theta_D$) has been utilized to
correlate its topical features including thermoelectric behaviors. The studied
thermoelectric transport properties of CPTO yielded the Seebeck coefficient

problem. Normally the goal is to minimize a loss function that depends on what
is called the network function, or in other words the function that gives the
network output given a certain input. This function depends on a large number
of parameters, also known as weights, that depends on the network architecture.
In general the goal of this optimization problem is to find the global minimum
of the network function. In this paper it is discussed how due to how neural
networks are designed, the neural network function present a very large
symmetry in the parameter space. This work shows how the neural network
function has a number of equivalent minima, in other words minima that give the
same value for the loss function and the same exact output, that grows
factorially with the number of neurons in each layer for feed forward neural
network or with the number of filters in a convolutional neural networks. When
the number of neurons and layers is large, the number of equivalent minima
grows extremely fast. This will have of course consequences for the study of
how neural networks converges to minima during training. This results is known,
but in this paper for the first time a proper mathematical discussion is
presented and an estimate of the number of equivalent minima is derived.

network (GNN). Although many approaches to improve the over-smoothing problem
have been proposed, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding and
conclusion of this problem. In this work, we analyze the over-smoothing problem
from the Markov chain perspective. We focus on message passing of GNN and first
establish a connection between GNNs and Markov chains on the graph. GNNs are
divided into two classes of operator-consistent and operator-inconsistent based
on whether the corresponding Markov chains are time-homogeneous. Next we
attribute the over-smoothing problem to the convergence of an arbitrary initial
distribution to a stationary distribution. Based on this, we prove that
although the previously proposed methods can alleviate over-smoothing, but
these methods cannot avoid the over-smoothing problem. In addition, we give the
conclusion of the over-smoothing problem in two types of GNNs in the Markovian
sense. On the one hand, operator-consistent GNN cannot avoid over-smoothing at
an exponential rate. On the other hand, operator-inconsistent GNN is not always
over-smoothing. Further, we investigate the existence of the limiting
distribution of the time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, from which we derive a
sufficient condition for operator-inconsistent GNN to avoid over-smoothing.
Finally, we design experiments to verify our findings. Results show that our
proposed sufficient condition can effectively improve over-smoothing problem in
operator-inconsistent GNN and enhance the performance of the model.

cover metric, the Johnson bound guarantees list-decodability of such codes.
That is, the Johnson bound provides a lower bound on the list-decoding radius
of a code in terms of its relative minimum distance $\delta$, list size $L$ and
the alphabet size $q.$ For study of list-decodability of codes with insertion
and deletion errors (we call such codes insdel codes), it is natural to ask the
open problem whether there is also a Johnson-type bound. The problem was first
investigated by Wachter-Zeh and the result was amended by Hayashi and Yasunaga
where a lower bound on the list-decodability for insdel codes was derived.
  The main purpose of this paper is to move a step further towards solving the
above open problem. In this work, we provide a new lower bound for the
list-decodability of an insdel code. As a consequence, we show that unlike the
Johnson bound for codes under other metrics that is tight, the bound on
list-decodability of insdel codes given by Hayashi and Yasunaga is not tight.
Our main idea is to show that if an insdel code with a given Levenshtein
distance $d$ is not list-decodable with list size $L$, then the list decoding
radius is lower bounded by a bound involving $L$ and $d$. In other words, if
the list decoding radius is less than this lower bound, the code must be
list-decodable with list size $L$. At the end of the paper we use such bound to
provide an insdel-list-decodability bound for various well-known codes, which
has not been extensively studied before.

the A(Li) of Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)

7,768 Li-rich giants with Li abundances ranging from 2.0 to 5.4 dex, accounting

FER performance by leveraging cross-domain datasets. Unlike the coarse and
biased expression label, the facial Action Unit (AU) is fine-grained and
objective suggested by psychological studies. Motivated by this, we resort to
the AU information of different FER datasets for performance boosting and make
contributions as follows. First, we experimentally show that the naive joint
training of multiple FER datasets is harmful to the FER performance of
individual datasets. We further introduce expression-specific mean images and
AU cosine distances to measure FER dataset bias. This novel measurement shows
consistent conclusions with experimental degradation of joint training. Second,
we propose a simple yet conceptually-new framework, AU-aware Vision Transformer
(AU-ViT). It improves the performance of individual datasets by jointly
training auxiliary datasets with AU or pseudo-AU labels. We also find that the
AU-ViT is robust to real-world occlusions. Moreover, for the first time, we

self-supervised pseudo labeling to achieve class-wise global alignment [1] or
rely on local structure extraction that encourages feature consistency among
neighborhoods [2]. While impressive progress has been made, both lines of
methods have their own drawbacks - the ""global"" approach is sensitive to noisy
labels while the ""local"" counterpart suffers from source bias. In this paper,
we present Divide and Contrast (DaC), a new paradigm for SFUDA that strives to
connect the good ends of both worlds while bypassing their limitations. Based
on the prediction confidence of the source model, DaC divides the target data
into source-like and target-specific samples, where either group of samples is
treated with tailored goals under an adaptive contrastive learning framework.
Specifically, the source-like samples are utilized for learning global class
clustering thanks to their relatively clean labels. The more noisy
target-specific data are harnessed at the instance level for learning the
intrinsic local structures. We further align the source-like domain with the
target-specific samples using a memory bank-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy

semi-supervised learning. However, the robustness of GNNs in the presence of
label noise remains a largely under-explored problem. In this paper, we
consider an important yet challenging scenario where labels on nodes of graphs
are not only noisy but also scarce. In this scenario, the performance of GNNs
is prone to degrade due to label noise propagation and insufficient learning.
To address these issues, we propose a novel RTGNN (Robust Training of Graph
Neural Networks via Noise Governance) framework that achieves better robustness
by learning to explicitly govern label noise. More specifically, we introduce
self-reinforcement and consistency regularization as supplemental supervision.
The self-reinforcement supervision is inspired by the memorization effects of
deep neural networks and aims to correct noisy labels. Further, the consistency
regularization prevents GNNs from overfitting to noisy labels via mimicry loss
in both the inter-view and intra-view perspectives. To leverage such
supervisions, we divide labels into clean and noisy types, rectify inaccurate
labels, and further generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled nodes. Supervision for
nodes with different types of labels is then chosen adaptively. This enables
sufficient learning from clean labels while limiting the impact of noisy ones.
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our RTGNN
framework, and the results validate its consistent superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods with two types of label noises and various noise
rates.

technology in the sixth generation (6G) communication. A realistic channel
model is a prerequisite for designing JCAS systems. Most existing channel
models independently generate the communication and sensing channels under the
same framework. However, due to the multiplexing of hardware resources (e.g.,
antennas) and the same environment, signals enabled for communication and
sensing may experience some shared propagation scatterers. This practical
sharing feature necessities the joint generation of communication and sensing
channels for realistic modeling, where the shared clusters (contributed by the
shared scatterers) should be jointly reconstructed for both channels. In this
paper, we first conduct communication and sensing channel measurements for an
indoor scenario at 28 GHz. The power-angular-delay profiles (PADPs) of
multipath components (MPCs) are obtained, and the shared scatterers by
communication and sensing channels are intuitively observed. Then, a stochastic
JCAS channel model is proposed to capture the sharing feature, where shared and
non-shared clusters by the two channels are defined and superimposed. To
extract those clusters from measured JCAS channels, a KPowerMeans-based joint
clustering algorithm (KPM-JCA) is novelly introduced. Finally, stochastic
channel characteristics are analyzed, and the practicality and controllability
of the proposed model are validated based on the measurements and empirical
simulations. The proposed model can realistically capture the sharing feature
of JCAS channels, which is valuable for the design and deployment of JCAS
systems.

inhomogeneous anisotropic media with the index of refraction $n(x)\equiv 1$ in
two and three dimension. Starting with a nonlinear fourth order formulation
established by Cakoni, Colton and Haddar [2009], by introducing some auxiliary
variables, we present an equivalent mixed formulation for this problem,
followed up with the finite element discretization. Using the proposed scheme,
we rigorously show that the optimal convergence rate for the transmission
eigenvalues both on convex and nonconvex domains can be expected. Moreover, by
this scheme, we will obtain a sparse generalized eigenvalue problem whose size
is so demanding even with a coarse mesh that its smallest few real eigenvalues
fail to be solved by the shift and invert method. We partially overcome this
critical issue by deflating the almost all of the $\infty$ eigenvalue of huge
multiplicity, resulting in a drastic reduction of the matrix size without
deteriorating the sparsity. Extensive numerical examples are reported to
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

main limitations of TO and RL when applied to continuous nonlinear systems to
minimize a non-convex cost function. Specifically, TO can get stuck in poor
local minima when the search is not initialized close to a ""good"" minimum. On
the other hand, when dealing with continuous state and control spaces, the RL
training process may be excessively long and strongly dependent on the
exploration strategy. Thus, our algorithm learns a ""good"" control policy via
TO-guided RL policy search that, when used as initial guess provider for TO,
makes the trajectory optimization process less prone to converge to poor local
optima. Our method is validated on several reaching problems featuring
non-convex obstacle avoidance with different dynamical systems, including a car
model with 6D state, and a 3-joint planar manipulator. Our results show the
great capabilities of CACTO in escaping local minima, while being more
computationally efficient than the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

V838 Monocerotis is a peculiar binary that underwent an immense
stellar explosion in 2002, leaving behind an expanding cool supergiant and a
hot B3V companion. Five years after the outburst, the B3V companion disappeared
from view, and so far did not recover. Aims. We investigate the changes in the
light curve and spectral features Methods. A monitoring campaign has been
performed during the past 13 years with the Nordic Optical Telescope to obtain
optical photometric and spectroscopic data. The data sets are used to analyse
the temporal evolution of the spectral features and the spectral energy
distribution, and to characterize the object. Results. Our photometric data
show a steady brightening in all bands during the past 13 years, which is
particularly prominent in the blue. This rise is also reflected in the spectra,
showing a gradual relative increase in the continuum flux at shorter
wavelengths. In addition, a slow brightening of the Ha emission line starting
in 2015 was detected. These changes might imply that the B3V companion is
slowly reappearing. During the same time interval, our analysis reveals a
considerable change in the observed colours of the object along with a steady
decrease in the strength and width of molecular absorption bands in our
low-resolution spectra. These changes suggest a rising temperature of the cool
supergiant along with a weakening of its wind, most likely combined with a slow
recovery of the secondary due to the evaporation of the dust and accretion of
the material from the shell in which the hot companion is embedded. From our
medium-resolution spectra, we find that the heliocentric radial velocity of the
atomic absorption line of TiI 6556.06 A has been stable for more than a decade.
We propose that TiI lines are tracing the velocity of the red supergiant in
V838 Mon, and not representing the infalling matter as previously stated.

leak term in the artificial leaky integrate-and-fire neuron is achieved by
engineering the uniaxial anisotropy profile of the neuronal device. The
synaptic device has a similar structure as the neuronal device but has a
constant uniaxial anisotropy. The synaptic device also has a linear and
symmetric weight update, which is a highly desirable trait of an artificial
synapse. Neuronal and synaptic devices based on magnetic domain-wall (DW)

mural image to restore the visual appearance. Most existing image-inpainting
methods tend to take a target image as the only input and directly repair the
damage to generate a visually plausible result. These methods obtain high
performance in restoration or completion of some specific objects, e.g., human
face, fabric texture, and printed texts, etc., however, are not suitable for
repairing murals with varied subjects, especially for murals with large damaged
areas. Moreover, due to the discrete colors in paints, mural inpainting may
suffer from apparent color bias as compared to natural image inpainting. To
this end, in this paper, we propose a line drawing guided progressive mural
inpainting method. It divides the inpainting process into two steps: structure
reconstruction and color correction, executed by a structure reconstruction
network (SRN) and a color correction network (CCN), respectively. In the
structure reconstruction, line drawings are used by SRN as a guarantee for
large-scale content authenticity and structural stability. In the color
correction, CCN operates a local color adjustment for missing pixels which
reduces the negative effects of color bias and edge jumping. The proposed
approach is evaluated against the current state-of-the-art image inpainting
methods. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed method in mural image inpainting. The codes and data are available

revealed event horizon-scale images of the supermassive black holes Sgr A* and

general relativity. We present LQG-motivated rotating black hole (LMRBH)
spacetimes, which are regular everywhere and asymptotically encompass the Kerr
black hole as a particular case. The LMRBH metric describes a multi-horizon
black hole in the sense that it can admit up to three horizons, such that an
extremal LMRBH, unlike the Kerr black hole, refers to a black hole with angular
momentum $a>M$. The metric, depending on the parameters, describes (1) black
holes with only one horizon (BH-I), (2) black holes with an event horizon and a
Cauchy horizons (BH-II), (3) black holes with three horizons (BH-III) or (4)
no-horizon (NH) spacetime, which, we show, is almost ruled out by the EHT
observations. We constrain the LQG parameter with the aid of the EHT shadow
observational results of M87* and Sgr A*,respectively, for an inclination angle
of $17^0$ and $50^0$. In particular, the VLTI bound for the Sgr A*, $\delta\in

When the walker is biased toward high-degree neighbors, the best performance

it uses the confidence score predicted by the backbone SOT network to
automatically derive neighbor information and then uses this information to
improve the tracking results. When tracking an occluded target, its appearance
features are untrustworthy. However, a general siamese network often cannot
tell whether the tracked object is occluded by reading the confidence score
alone, because it could be misled by neighbors with high confidence scores. Our
proposed NeighborTrack takes advantage of unoccluded neighbors' information to
reconfirm the tracking target and reduces false tracking when the target is
occluded. It not only reduces the impact caused by occlusion, but also fixes
tracking problems caused by object appearance changes. NeighborTrack is
agnostic to SOT networks and post-processing methods. For the VOT challenge
dataset commonly used in short-term object tracking, we improve three famous
SOT networks, Ocean, TransT, and OSTrack, by an average of ${1.92\%}$ EAO and

intrinsic interpretability or post-hoc explainability. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of existing works on eXplainable RL (XRL) and
introduce a new taxonomy where prior works are clearly categorized into
model-explaining, reward-explaining, state-explaining, and task-explaining
methods. We also review and highlight RL methods that conversely leverage human
knowledge to promote learning efficiency and performance of agents while this
kind of method is often ignored in XRL field. Some challenges and opportunities

LILs of (truncated) occupation times on balls $B(x,r)$ of radii $r$ up to an

by showing that the function $\Phi$ is optimal. Our first result on LILs of

transience and recurrence of the process. Our assumptions are truly local in
particular at zero and the function $\Phi$ in our truncated occupation times $r

$x$ too. We also prove that a similar LIL for total occupation times $r

transient. Then we establish LIL concerning large time behaviors of occupation
times $t \mapsto \int_0^t {\bf 1}_{A}(Y_s)ds$

the bias, variance and generalization bounds of DR methods, we find that
existing DR approaches may have poor generalization caused by inaccurate
estimation of propensity scores and imputation errors, which often occur in
practice. Motivated by such analysis, we propose a generalized learning
framework that not only unifies existing DR methods, but also provides a
valuable opportunity to develop a series of new debiasing techniques to
accommodate different application scenarios. Based on the framework, we propose
two new DR methods, namely DR-BIAS and DR-MSE. DR-BIAS directly controls the
bias of DR loss, while DR-MSE balances the bias and variance flexibly, which
achieves better generalization performance. In addition, we propose a novel
tri-level joint learning optimization method for DR-MSE in CVR prediction, and
an efficient training algorithm correspondingly. We conduct extensive
experiments on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, which validate the
effectiveness of our proposed methods.

the heavy stops pushed up by the LHC searches; (ii) The DM relic density can be
readily achieved by the thermal freeze-out of the lightest neutralino and the
null results of DM direct detections are typically driving the parameter space
to the bino-like lightest neutralino region; (iii) The muon g-2 anomaly

light sleptons and electroweakinos possibly accessible at the HL-LHC; (iv) The

Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to fit the partitioned local regions, and these
MLPs are organized in tree structure to share parameters according to the
spatial distance. The parameter sharing scheme not only ensures the continuity
between adjacent regions, but also jointly removes the local and non-local

interest in neuroscience, the specific structures that could be useful for
spike-time codes remain highly unclear. Here, we introduce a new analytical
approach, using techniques from discrete mathematics, to study spike-time
codes. We focus on the phenomenon of ``phase precession'' in the rodent
hippocampus. During navigation and learning on a physical track, specific cells
in a rodent's brain form a highly structured pattern relative to the
oscillation of local population activity. Studies of phase precession largely
focus on its well established role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation.
Comparatively less attention has been paid to the fact that phase precession
represents one of the best candidates for a spike-time neural code. The precise
nature of this code remains an open question. Here, we derive an analytical
expression for an operator mapping points in physical space, through individual
spike times, to complex numbers. The properties of this operator highlight a
specific relationship between past and future in hippocampal spike patterns.
Importantly, this approach generalizes beyond the specific phenomenon studied
here, providing a new technique to study the neural codes within spike-time
sequences found during sensory coding and motor behavior. We then introduce a
novel spike-based decoding algorithm, based on this operator, that successfully
decodes a simulated animal's trajectory using only the animal's initial
position and a pattern of spike times. This decoder is robust to noise in spike
times and works on a timescale almost an order of magnitude shorter than
typically used with decoders that work on average firing rate. These results
illustrate the utility of a discrete approach, based on the symmetries in spike
patterns, to provide insight into the structure and function of neural systems.

but there are limited investigations on the merits of such analysis compared to
prediction based on dynamic FC or region level functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) times series that encode temporal variability. To account for
the temporal dynamics in fMRI data, we propose a deep neural network involving
bi-directional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) approach that also incorporates
feature selection mechanism. The proposed pipeline is implemented via an
efficient GPU computation framework and applied to predict intelligence scores
based on region level fMRI time series as well as dynamic FC. We compare the
prediction performance for different intelligence measures based on static FC,
dynamic FC, and region level time series acquired from the Adolescent Brain
Cognitive Development (ABCD) study involving close to 7000 individuals. Our
detailed analysis illustrates that static FC consistently has inferior
prediction performance compared to region level time series or dynamic FC for
unimodal rest and task fMRI experiments, and in almost all cases using a
combination of task and rest features. In addition, the proposed bi-LSTM
pipeline based on region level time series identifies several shared and
differential important brain regions across task and rest fMRI experiments that
drive intelligence prediction. A test-retest analysis of the selected features
shows strong reliability across cross-validation folds. Given the large sample
size from ABCD study, our results provide strong evidence that superior
prediction of intelligence can be achieved by accounting for temporal

never been more pronounced. Anthropogenic pollution is in fact the largest
effector of the observed evolving atmospheric composition (Wallace, 2006).
PM2.5 is a class of particulate matter pollutants of notable interest due to
their significant driving of chemical, atmospheric change, their wide-scale,
global circulations, and their malignant effects on human health; with a
diameter of less than 2.5 microns; PM2.5s derive from combustion of organic
materials, including fossil fuel combustion (Wallace, 2006) and forest fires
(Newman, 2007). The gases released in these combustion reactions then condense
in the atmosphere, undergoing gas to particle conversion, resulting in the
atmospheric presence of PM2.5s. Particulate matter (PM) pollutants are harmful
to human health in all diameter scales; increasing in recent years global
morbidity and mortality (Araujo, 2011). The health risks of PM2.5 in particular
are troubling due to their small size, which facilities their permeability in
the respiratory system and ready diffusion into the bloodstream, inducing
pathologies like ischaemic heart disease, respiratory infections, and lung
cancers to name a few (Araujo, 2011). Once PM2.5 manifest in the atmosphere,
they circulate on a larger scale due to atmospheric circulation patterns.
Though government-enacted air quality measures have reduced the average PM2.5
levels in North America, pollution episodes still cause localized, acute PM2.5
exposure. The purpose of this project was to analyze PM2.5 mean concentration
across America to identify and quantify any pollution episodes, as well as try
to explain their dynamics using large scale, meteorological processes.

and McGurk effect, which are discussed by many researchers. Our M-SNN
constituted by the meta operator called network motifs. The source of 3-node

temporal dataset. In the single-sensory classification task, the results showed
the accuracy of M-SNN using network motif topologies was higher than the pure
feedforward network topology without using them. In the multi-sensory
integration task, the performance of M-SNN using artificial network motif was
better than the state-of-the-art SNN using BRP (biologically-plausible reward
propagation). Furthermore, the M-SNN could better simulate the cocktail party
effect and McGurk effect with lower computational cost. We think the artificial
network motifs could be considered as some prior knowledge that would
contribute to the multi-sensory integration of SNNs and provide more benefits
for simulating the cognitive phenomenon.

electrical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The high-density batteries and
purely electrical propulsion systems have disrupted the space of UAV design,
making this domain an ideal target for AI-based design. In this paper, we
develop an AI Designer that synthesizes novel UAV designs. Our approach uses a
deep transformer model with a novel domain-specific encoding such that we can
evaluate the performance of new proposed designs without running expensive

reaches the optimal quantization level after a few training epochs, which we
refer to as the partly scratch-off lottery ticket. This

spikes are caused by regions of configuration space that are over-represented
by the wave function density, which are called ``spurious modes'' in the
machine learning literature. After exploring these spurious modes in detail, we
demonstrate that a collective-variable-based penalization yields a
substantially more robust training procedure, preventing the formation of
spurious modes and improving the accuracy of energy estimates. Because the

We demonstrate that with appropriately designed weights the agents achieve
consensus under additive communication noise. We establish that when the
communication links are noiseless the proposed algorithm moves towards
consensus at a geometric rate. Under communication noise, we prove that the

find the differences; 3) finally generating a new report to accommodate
identified differences based on the conditional report. We evaluate DeltaNet on

not only makes full use of the interaction between different modalities but

adopted to model the inter-modal interaction between text and audio sequences
and initialize the fusion representations. After that, as the core unit of the
