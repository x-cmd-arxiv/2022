Ukraine, where regional economic inequality is a crucial issue the country
faces in its medium and long-term development, recently, even in the short
term. We analyze the determinants of regional economic growth, mainly
industrial and agricultural productions, population, human capital, fertility,
migration, and regional government expenditures. Using panel data estimations
from 2004 to 2020 for 27 regions of Ukraine, our results show that the gaps
between regions in Ukraine have widened last two decades. Natural resource
distribution, agricultural and industrial productions, government spending, and
migration can explain the disparities. We show that regional government
spending is highly concentrated in Kyiv, and the potential of the other
regions, especially the Western ones, needs to be used sufficiently. Moreover,
despite its historical and economic opportunity, the East region performed
little development during the last two decades. The inefficient and
inconsistent regional policies played a crucial role in these disparities.

learning (ML) models and empower human+ML teaming in situations where the task
cannot be fully automated. Different contexts require explanations with
different properties. For example, the kind of explanation required to
determine if an early cardiac arrest warning system is ready to be integrated
into a care setting is very different from the type of explanation required for
a loan applicant to help determine the actions they might need to take to make
their application successful.
  Unfortunately, there is a lack of standardization when it comes to properties
of explanations: different papers may use the same term to mean different
quantities, and different terms to mean the same quantity. This lack of a
standardized terminology and categorization of the properties of ML
explanations prevents us from both rigorously comparing interpretable machine
learning methods and identifying what properties are needed in what contexts.
  In this work, we survey properties defined in interpretable machine learning
papers, synthesize them based on what they actually measure, and describe the
trade-offs between different formulations of these properties. In doing so, we
enable more informed selection of task-appropriate formulations of explanation
properties as well as standardization for future work in interpretable machine

physical systems and their properties. Quantum mechanics in its standard form
is a more problematic case: here, interpretational problems have led to doubts
about the tenability of realist views. Thus, QBists and Quantum Pragmatists
maintain that quantum mechanics should not be thought of as representing
physical systems, but rather as an agent-centered tool for updating beliefs
about such systems. It is part and parcel of such views that different agents
may have different beliefs and may assign different quantum states. What
results is a collection of agent-centered perspectives rather than a unique
representation of the physical world.
  In this paper we argue that the problems identified by QBism and Quantum
Pragmatism do not necessitate abandoning the ideal of representing the physical
world. We can avail ourselves of the same puzzle-solving strategies as employed
by QBists and pragmatists by adopting a \emph{perspectival quantum realism}.
According to this perspectivalism (close to the relational interpretation of
quantum mechanics) objects may possess different, but equally objective
properties with respect to different physically defined perspectives. We
discuss two options for such a perspectivalism, a local and a nonlocal one, and
apply them to Wigner's friend and EPR scenarios. Finally, we connect quantum
perspectivalism to the recently proposed philosophical position of
\emph{fragmentalism}.

  Methods: A small convolutional neural network called MODEST is proposed to
reconstruct 4D-MRI by performing a spatial and temporal decomposition, omitting
the need for 4D convolutions to use all the spatio-temporal information present
in 4D-MRI. This network is trained on undersampled 4D-MRI after respiratory
binning to reconstruct high-quality 4D-MRI obtained by compressed sensing
reconstruction. The network is trained, validated, and tested on 4D-MRI of 28
lung cancer patients acquired with a T1-weighted golden-angle radial
stack-of-stars sequence. The 4D-MRI of 18, 5, and 5 patients were used for
training, validation, and testing. Network performances are evaluated on image
quality measured by the structural similarity index (SSIM) and motion
consistency by comparing the position of the lung-liver interface on
undersampled 4D-MRI before and after respiratory binning. The network is
compared to conventional architectures such as a U-Net, which has 30 times more
trainable parameters.
  Results: MODEST can reconstruct high-quality 4D-MRI with higher image quality
than a U-Net, despite a thirty-fold reduction in trainable parameters.
High-quality 4D-MRI can be obtained using MODEST in approximately 2.5 minutes,
including acquisition, processing, and reconstruction.
  Conclusion: High-quality accelerated 4D-MRI can be obtained using MODEST,
which is particularly interesting for MRI-guided radiotherapy.

generation and radiative recombination are affected by structural ordering. We
experimentally determine the CTS binding energy of a series of model, small
molecule donor-acceptor blends, where the used acceptors (B2PYMPM, B3PYMPM and
B4PYMPM) differ only in the nitrogen position of their lateral pyridine rings.
We find that the formation of an ordered, face-on molecular packing in B4PYMPM
is beneficial to efficient, field-independent charge separation, leading to
fill factors over 70% in photovoltaic devices. This is rationalized by a
comprehensive computational protocol showing that, compared to the more
amorphous and isotropically oriented B2PYMPM, the higher order of the B4PYMPM
molecules provides more delocalized CTS. Furthermore, we find no correlation
between the quantum efficiency of radiative free charge carrier recombination
and the bound or unbound nature of the CTS. This work highlights the importance
of structural ordering at donor-acceptor interfaces for efficient free carrier
generation and shows that more ordering and less bound CT states do not
preclude efficient radiative recombination.

on the OB+BH detection using the conservative DR3 publishing criteria. BSG
primaries and triples are not expected to impact the false-positive
identification fractions significantly. However, if the evolutionary stage of
the primary star is unknown, the usage of the BSG curves is still recommended.
This also reduces the OB+BH identification fraction significantly. The primary
mass does not need to be known to benefit from the high identification fraction
of OB+BHs, while keeping the fraction of false-positives low. We find no OB+BH
candidates in the ALS II among the DR3 orbits. This null-detection cannot be
attributed to the underlying BH-formation scenario, but rather to the stringent
DR3 selection criteria. To infer the BH-formation scenario with Gaia, we
propose that the constraint on the relative parallax precision in DR4 should be
95% less conservative than the DR3 criterion.(Abridged)

technologies such as computing, sensing and cryptography, its widespread use is
hindered by its sensitivity to noise and losses. Interestingly, even when
entanglement has been destroyed, some tasks still exhibit a quantum advantage
$Q$, defined by a $Q$-time speedup, over any classical strategies. A prominent
example is the quantum radar, which enhances the detection of the presence of a
target in noisy surroundings. To beat all classical strategies, Lloyd proposed
to use a probe initially entangled with an idler that can be recombined and
measured with the reflected probe. Observing any quantum advantage requires
exploiting the quantum correlations between the probe and the idler. It
involves their joint measurement or at least adapting the idler detection to
the outcome of the probe measurement. In addition to successful demonstrations
of such quantum illumination protocols at optical frequencies, the proposal of
a microwave radar, closer to conventional radars, gathered a lot of interest.
However, previous microwave implementations have not demonstrated any quantum
advantage as probe and idler were always measured independently. In this work,
we implement a joint measurement using a superconducting circuit and
demonstrate a quantum advantage $Q>1$ for microwave radar. Storing the idler
mitigates the detrimental impact of microwave loss on the quantum advantage,
and the purity of the initial entangled state emerges as the next limit. While
the experiment is a proof-of-principle performed inside a dilution
refrigerator, it exhibits some of the inherent difficulties in implementing
quantum radars such as the limited range of parameters where a quantum
advantage can be observed or the requirement for very low probe and idler
temperatures.

which is partially degenerate with CB and miscalibration of the polarization
angle. We use full-sky beam convolution simulations including HWP to generate
mock noiseless time-ordered data, process them through a bin averaging
map-maker, and calculate the power spectra including $TB$ and $EB$
correlations. We also derive analytical formulae which accurately model the
observed spectra. For our choice of HWP parameters, the HWP-induced angle
amounts to a few degrees, which could be misinterpreted as CB. Accurate
knowledge of the HWP is required to mitigate this. Our simulation and
analytical formulae will be useful for deriving requirements for the accuracy
of HWP calibration.

estimates on the moments of all orders of the volume of the cluster of the

estimates on the tail of the volume of the cluster of the origin, denoted $K$,
at criticality, namely \[ \mathbb{P}_{\beta_c}(|K|\geq n) \asymp \begin{cases}
n^{-(d-\alpha)/(d+\alpha)} & d < 3\alpha\\ n^{-1/2}(\log n)^{1/4} & d=3\alpha

the study of the scaling limit of the model: In the high-dimensional case $d

chi-squared random variable, while in the low-dimensional case $d<3\alpha$ we

effective projector: it arises from the normalized application of the
observable over the initial state, with a constant of proportionality that is
real. The argument of the weak value of a projector on a pure state of an
$N$-level system corresponds to a symplectic area in the complex projective
space $(\text{CP}^{N-1})$, which can be represented geometrically with a sum of
$N-1$ solid angles on the Bloch sphere using the Majorana stellar
representation. Here, we show that the argument of the weak value of a general

solid angles on the Bloch sphere, merging both studies. These two approaches
provide two geometrical descriptions, a first one in $\text{CP}^{N-1}$ and a
second one on the Bloch sphere, after mapping the problem from the original
space $(\text{CP}^{N-1})$ by making use of the Majorana representation. These
results can also be applied to the argument of the third-order Bargmann
invariant, the most fundamental order as the argument of any higher order
invariant can be expressed as a sum of the argument of third-order Bargmann
invariants. Finally, we focus on the argument of the weak value of a general

to devise ways of sharing the already written proofs to prevent wasting time
redoing them. One of the challenges in this domain is to translate proofs
written in proof assistants based on impredicative logics, such as Coq, Matita
and the HOL family, to proof assistants based on predicative logics like Agda,
whenever impredicativity is not used in an essential way. In this paper we
present an algorithm to do such a translation between a core impredicative type
system and a core predicative one allowing prenex universe polymorphism like in
Agda. It consists in trying to turn a potentially impredicative term into a
universe polymorphic term as general as possible. The use of universe
polymorphism is justified by the fact that mapping an impredicative universe to
a fixed predicative one is not sufficient in most cases. During the algorithm,
we need to solve unification problems modulo the max-successor algebra on
universe levels. But, in this algebra, there are solvable problems having no
most general solution. We however provide an incomplete algorithm whose
solutions, when it succeeds, are most general ones. The proposed translation is
of course partial, but in practice allows one to translate many proofs that do
not use impredicativity in an essential way. Indeed, it was implemented in the
tool Predicativize and then used to translate semi-automatically many
non-trivial developments from Matita's arithmetic library to Agda, including
Bertrand's Postulate and Fermat's Little Theorem, which were not available in
Agda yet.

efficiency lighting and display applications, which have enabled significant
energy savings in the last decade. Despite the wide application of GaN LEDs,
transport mechanisms across InGaN/GaN heterostructures in these devices are not
well-explained. Fixed polarization sheet charges at InGaN/GaN interfaces lead
to large interface dipole charges, which create large potential barriers to
overcome. One-dimensional models for transport across such heterostructures
predict turn-on voltages that are significantly higher than that found in real
devices. As a result, conventional models for transport cannot predict the
performance of new designs such as for longer wavelength LEDs, or for
multi-quantum well LEDs. In this work, we show that incorporating low and high
Indium compositions within quantum wells at the submicron scale can provide
accurate prediction of the characteristics of GaN/InGaN light emitting diodes.

introduce a novel task of conversational aspect-based sentiment quadruple

large-scale high-quality DiaASQ dataset in both Chinese and English languages.
We deliberately develop a neural model to benchmark the task, which advances in
effectively performing end-to-end quadruple prediction, and manages to
incorporate rich dialogue-specific and discourse feature representations for
better cross-utterance quadruple extraction. We hope the new benchmark will
spur more advancements in the sentiment analysis community.

metrology. In a classical sense, measurement measures physically existing
quantities, such as length, mass, and time. By contrast, modern measurement
measures a wide spectrum of objects, for example, an imaging biomarker, which
is a user-defined pattern. Artificial-intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis is
another example. If we regard an optical coherence tomography (OCT) device
equipped with diagnostic AI as a comprehensive ""measurement system,"" the object
being measured is a ""disease,"" which is not a physical quantity but a concept.
  To comprehend the wide range of modern measurements, we introduce a
speculative, i.e., philosophical and theoretical, model called the
""epistemological-metrology model."" In this model, we describe the act of
measurement as cascading encoding-and-decoding processes. In the encoding
processes, three types of objects-to-be measured are considered, which include
substance, existence, and concept. Then we classify acts of measurement into
""sensing,"" ""understanding,"" and ""reasoning,"" which measure the substance,
existence, and concept, respectively.
  We note that the measurements in the understanding and reasoning classes are
constructive. Namely, they proactively define the quantity-to-be-measured by
the measurement modalities themselves. A speculative method to warrant the
relevance of such constructive measurements is presented.
  We investigate several modern OCT-related measurements, including AI-based
diagnosis, types of polarization sensitive OCT, and attenuation coefficient
imaging, using our theoretical framework.

simulations. After validating our methods on Gaussian and lognormal fields, we
show that `multi-scale' PDFs - measured from maps with multiple levels of
smoothing - offer considerable gains over two-point statistics, owing to their
ability to extract non-Gaussian information: for a mock Stage-III survey,
lensing PDFs yield 33\% tighter constraints on the clustering parameter
$S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ than the two-point shear correlation
functions. For Stage-IV surveys, we achieve $>$90\% tighter constraints on
$S_8$, but also on the Hubble and dark energy equation of state parameters.
Interestingly, we find improvements when combining these two probes only in our
Stage-III setup; in the Stage-IV scenario the lensing PDFs contain all
information from the standard two-point statistics and more. This suggests that
while these two probes are currently complementary, the lower noise levels of
upcoming surveys will unleash the constraining power of the PDF.

the light from a pulsed light source operating below this upper frequency can

underlying reason for concerted ion hopping, a mechanism common among
superionic conductors such as Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$ (LLZO) and
Li$_{1.3}$Al$_{0.3}$Ti$_{1.7}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ (LATP). While first principles
simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) provide insight into the Li$^+$
transport mechanism, historically, there has been a gap in the temperature
ranges studied in simulations and experiments. Here, we used a neural network
(NN) potential trained on density functional theory (DFT) simulations, to run
up to 40-nanosecond long MD simulations at DFT-like accuracy to characterize
the ion conduction mechanisms across a range of temperatures that includes
previous simulations and experimental studies. We have confirmed a Li$^+$
sublattice phase transition in LGPS around 400 K, below which the
\textit{ab}-plane diffusivity $D^*_{ab}$ is drastically reduced. Concomitant
with the sublattice phase transition near 400 K, there is less cation-cation
(cross) correlation, as characterized by Haven ratios closer to 1, and the
vibrations in the system are more harmonic at lower temperature. Intuitively,
at high temperature, the collection of vibrational modes may be sufficient to
drive concerted ion hops. However, near room temperature, the vibrational modes
available may be insufficient to overcome electrostatic repulsion, thus
resulting in less correlated ion motion and comparatively slower ion
conduction. Such phenomena of a sublattice phase transition, below which
concerted hopping plays a less significant role, may be extended to other
highly concentrated solid electrolytes such as LLZO and LATP.

practical implementations of the algorithm are limited by the noise of quantum

technique for improving the generalization of deep neural networks for various
settings. However, the underlying working of SAM remains elusive because of
various intriguing approximations in the theoretical characterizations. SAM
intends to penalize a notion of sharpness of the model but implements a
computationally efficient variant; moreover, a third notion of sharpness was
used for proving generalization guarantees. The subtle differences in these
notions of sharpness can indeed lead to significantly different empirical
results. This paper rigorously nails down the exact sharpness notion that SAM
regularizes and clarifies the underlying mechanism. We also show that the two
steps of approximations in the original motivation of SAM individually lead to
inaccurate local conclusions, but their combination accidentally reveals the
correct effect, when full-batch gradients are applied. Furthermore, we also
prove that the stochastic version of SAM in fact regularizes the third notion
of sharpness mentioned above, which is most likely to be the preferred notion
for practical performance. The key mechanism behind this intriguing phenomenon
is the alignment between the gradient and the top eigenvector of Hessian when
SAM is applied.

  RAM-based Neural Network Accelerators","11 pages and 11 figures",,,,"cs.AR cs.AI cs.ET cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) is well-suited to accelerate neural
network (NN) workloads as RRAM-based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures
natively support highly-parallel multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations that form
the backbone of most NN workloads. Unfortunately, NN workloads such as
transformers require support for non-MAC operations (e.g., softmax) that RRAM
cannot provide natively. Consequently, state-of-the-art works either integrate
additional digital logic circuits to support the non-MAC operations or offload
the non-MAC operations to CPU/GPU, resulting in significant performance and
energy efficiency overheads due to data movement.
  In this work, we propose NEON, a novel compiler optimization to enable the
end-to-end execution of the NN workload in RRAM. The key idea of NEON is to
transform each non-MAC operation into a lightweight yet highly-accurate neural
network. Utilizing neural networks to approximate the non-MAC operations
provides two advantages: 1) We can exploit the key strength of RRAM, i.e.,
highly-parallel MAC operation, to flexibly and efficiently execute non-MAC
operations in memory. 2) We can simplify RRAM's microarchitecture by
eliminating the additional digital logic circuits while reducing the data
movement overheads. Acceleration of the non-MAC operations in memory enables
NEON to achieve a 2.28x speedup compared to an idealized digital logic-based
RRAM. We analyze the trade-offs associated with the transformation and
demonstrate feasible use cases for NEON across different substrates.

each round, the principal posts a contract that specifies the payment to the
agent based on each outcome. The agent then makes a strategic choice of action
that maximizes her own utility, but the action is not directly observable by
the principal. The principal observes the outcome and receives utility from the
agent's choice of action. Based on past observations, the principal dynamically
adjusts the contracts with the goal of maximizing her utility.
  We introduce an online learning algorithm and provide an upper bound on its
Stackelberg regret. We show that when the contract space is $[0,1]^m$, the
Stackelberg regret is upper bounded by $\widetilde O(\sqrt{m} \cdot
T^{1-1/(2m+1)})$, and lower bounded by $\Omega(T^{1-1/(m+2)})$, where
$\widetilde O$ omits logarithmic factors. This result shows that
exponential-in-$m$ samples are sufficient and necessary to learn a near-optimal
contract, resolving an open problem on the hardness of online contract design.
Moreover, when contracts are restricted to some subset $\mathcal{F} \subset
[0,1]^m$, we define an intrinsic dimension of $\mathcal{F}$ that depends on the
covering number of the spherical code in the space and bound the regret in
terms of this intrinsic dimension. When $\mathcal{F}$ is the family of linear
contracts, we show that the Stackelberg regret grows exactly as
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$.
  The contract design problem is challenging because the utility function is
discontinuous. Bounding the discretization error in this setting has been an
open problem. In this paper, we identify a limited set of directions in which
the utility function is continuous, allowing us to design a new discretization
method and bound its error. This approach enables the first upper bound with no
restrictions on the contract and action space.

RAPIDx, using processing in-memory (PIM) for sequence alignment. RAPIDx
achieves superior efficiency and performance via software-hardware co-design.
First, we propose an adaptive banded parallelism alignment algorithm suitable
for PIM architecture. Compared to the original dynamic programming-based
alignment, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the required
complexity, data bit width, and memory footprint at the cost of negligible
accuracy degradation. Then we propose the efficient PIM architecture that
implements the proposed algorithm. The data flow in RAPIDx achieves four-level
parallelism and we design an in-situ alignment computation flow in ReRAM,
delivering $5.5$-$9.7\times$ efficiency and throughput improvements compared to
our previous PIM design, RAPID. The proposed RAPIDx is reconfigurable to serve
as a co-processor integrated into existing genome analysis pipeline to boost
sequence alignment or edit distance calculation. On short-read alignment,
RAPIDx delivers $131.1\times$ and $46.8\times$ throughput improvements over

almost surely equal to $1/3$. This is in contrast to Ganguly-Zhang '22, where
it was shown that set of atypical stars on the line $\{x=0\}$ has dimension
$2/3$. This reduction of the dimension from $2/3$ to $1/3$ yields a
quantitative manifestation of the smoothing of the environment around a

training of a shared global model across distributed clients while keeping the
training data local. While most prior work on designing systems for FL has
focused on using stateful always running components, recent work has shown that
components in an FL system can greatly benefit from the usage of serverless
computing and Function-as-a-Service technologies. To this end, distributed
training of models with serverless FL systems can be more resource-efficient
and cheaper than conventional FL systems. However, serverless FL systems still
suffer from the presence of stragglers, i.e., slow clients due to their
resource and statistical heterogeneity. While several strategies have been
proposed for mitigating stragglers in FL, most methodologies do not account for
the particular characteristics of serverless environments, i.e., cold-starts,
performance variations, and the ephemeral stateless nature of the function
instances. Towards this, we propose FedLesScan, a novel clustering-based
semi-asynchronous training strategy, specifically tailored for serverless FL.
FedLesScan dynamically adapts to the behaviour of clients and minimizes the
effect of stragglers on the overall system. We implement our strategy by
extending an open-source serverless FL system called FedLess. Moreover, we
comprehensively evaluate our strategy using the 2nd generation Google Cloud
Functions with four datasets and varying percentages of stragglers. Results
from our experiments show that compared to other approaches FedLesScan reduces

based on the the recent conjecture suggesting the universe has transitioned
from anti-de Sitter vacua to de Sitter vacua (viz., the cosmological constant
switches sign from negative to positive), at redshift ${z_\dagger\sim2}$,
inspired by the graduated dark energy (gDE) model proposed in Akarsu et al.
[Phys. Rev. D 101, 063528 (2020)]. $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM was previously claimed
to simultaneously relax five cosmological discrepancies, namely, the $H_0$,
$S_8$, and $M_B$ tensions along with the Ly-$\alpha$ and $\omega_{\rm b}$
anomalies, which prevail within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model as well as its
canonical/simple extensions. In the present work, we extend the previous
analysis by constraining the model using the Pantheon data (with and without
the SH0ES $M_B$ prior) and/or the completed BAO data along with the full Planck
CMB data. We find that $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM exhibits a better fit to the data
compared to $\Lambda$CDM, and relaxes the six discrepancies of $\Lambda$CDM,
namely, the $H_0$, $M_B$, $S_8$, Ly-$\alpha$, $t_0$, and $\omega_{\rm b}$
discrepancies, each one discussed in detail. When the $M_B$ prior is included
in the analyses, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM performs significantly better in relaxing
the $H_0$, $M_B$, and $S_8$ tensions with the constraint ${z_\dagger\sim1.8}$
even when the Ly-$\alpha$ data (which imposed the $z_\dagger\sim2$ constraint
in the previous studies) are excluded. In contrast, the presence of the $M_B$
prior causes only negligible improvements for $\Lambda$CDM. Thus, the
$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model provides remedy to various cosmological tensions
simultaneously, only that the galaxy BAO data hinder its success to some
extent.

equations resulting from the application of the Neumann's and Young's laws at
the three fluids junction (triple point) and the two fluids--solid contact line
(at the substrate), as well as no--flow boundary conditions at the wall of the
container under axial symmetry. The formulation shows that the solutions are
parametrized by four dimensionless variables, which stand for: i) the volume of
the external liquid in the container, ii) two ratios of interfacial tensions,
and iii) the contact angle of the liquid drop at the substrate. In this
parameters space, we find solutions that consist of three interfaces: one which
connects the substrate with the triple point, and two that connect this point
with the symmetry axis and the wall. We find that the shape of the first
interface strongly depend on the height of the external liquid, while the
contact angle and the two ratios of surface tensions do not introduce
qualitative changes. In particular, the solution can show one or more necks, or
even no neck at all, depending on the value of the effective height of the
external fluid. An energetic analysis allows to predict the breakups of the
necks, which could give place to separated systems formed by a sessile drop and
a floating lens, plus eventual spherical droplets in between (depending on the
number of breakups).

a huge quantity of high quality data. However, a large part of these data are
photometric, and are thought not to be useful to derive a quantitative
information on the nebular emission of galaxies. The aim of this project is
first to identify galaxies at z > 4-6, and in the epoch of reionization from
their sub-mm colours. We also aim at showing that the colours can be used to
try and derive physical constraints from photometric bands, when accounting for
the contribution from the IR fine structure lines to these photometric bands.
We model the flux of IR fine structure lines with CLOUDY, and add them to the
dust continuum emission with CIGALE. Including or not emission lines in the
simulated spectral energy distribution (SED) modifies the broad band emission
and colours. The introduction of the lines allows to identify strong star
forming galaxies at z > 4 - 6 from the log10 (PSW_250um/PMW_350um) versus log10
(LABOCA_870um/PLW_500um) colour-colour diagramme. By comparing the relevant
models to each observed galaxy colour, we are able to roughly estimate the
fluxes of the lines, and the associated nebular parameters. This method allows
to identify a double sequence in a plot built from the ionization parameter and
the gas metallicity. The HII and photodissociation region (PDR) fine structure
lines are an essential part of the SEDs. It is important to add them when
modelling the spectra, especially at z > 4 - 6 where their equivalent widths
can be large. Conversely, we show that we can extract some information on
strong IR fine structure lines and on the physical parameters related to the
nebular emission from IR colour-colour diagrams.

  corrected",,,,"hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Schwinger-Keldysh diagram technique is usually involved in the
calculation of real-time in-in correlation functions. In the case of a thermal
state, one can analytically continue imaginary-time Matsubara correlation
functions to real times. Nevertheless, not all real-time correlation functions
usually can be obtained by such procedure. Moreover, numerical analytic
continuation is an ill-posed problem. Thus, even in the case of a thermal state
one may need for the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. If the potential of a system
admits degenerate minima, instantonic effects enter the game, so one should
also integrate over the instantonic moduli space, including the one,
corresponding to the imaginary time translational invariance. However, the
Schwinger-Keldysh closed time contour explicitly breaks such invariance. We
argue, that this invariance must be recovered, and show, how it can be done.
After that, we construct an extension of the Schwinger-Keldysh diagram
technique to instantonic systems and demonstrate it on the example of the first
few-point correlation functions.

$k$-server problem and other related problems, resolving some long-standing
conjectures. In particular, for metrical task systems (MTS) we asympotically
settle the competitive ratio and obtain the first improvement to an existential
lower bound since the introduction of the model 35 years ago (in 1987).
  More concretely, we show:
  1. There exist $(k+1)$-point metric spaces in which the randomized
competitive ratio for the $k$-server problem is $\Omega(\log^2 k)$. This
refutes the folklore conjecture (which is known to hold in some families of
metrics) that in all metric spaces with at least $k+1$ points, the competitive
ratio is $\Theta(\log k)$.
  2. Consequently, there exist $n$-point metric spaces in which the randomized
competitive ratio for MTS is $\Omega(\log^2 n)$. This matches the upper bound
that holds for all metrics. The previously best existential lower bound was
$\Omega(\log n)$ (which was known to be tight for some families of metrics).
  3. For all $k<n\in\mathbb N$, for *all* $n$-point metric spaces the
randomized $k$-server competitive ratio is at least $\Omega(\log k)$, and
consequently the randomized MTS competitive ratio is at least $\Omega(\log n)$.
These universal lower bounds are asymptotically tight. The previous bounds were
$\Omega(\log k/\log\log k)$ and $\Omega(\log n/\log \log n)$, respectively.
  4. The randomized competitive ratio for the $w$-set metrical service systems
problem, and its equivalent width-$w$ layered graph traversal problem, is
$\Omega(w^2)$. This slightly improves the previous lower bound and matches the
recently discovered upper bound.
  5. Our results imply improved lower bounds for other problems like $k$-taxi,
distributed paging and metric allocation.
  These lower bounds share a common thread, and other than the third bound,
also a common construction.

splitting, and clearly distinguish it from other local and non-local processes.
In the presence of a magnetic field, the dots are operated as spin-filters to

only do we demonstrate the splitting of Cooper pairs into opposite-spin
electrons (i.e. singlet pairing), but also into equal-spin electrons, thus
achieving a triplet pairing between the quantum dots. Notably, the
exceptionally strong spin-orbit interaction in our 2DEGs, results in comparable

volumes designed for the training of emulators. We validate the accuracy of
MGLenS with inference analyses based on the lensing power spectrum exploiting
our implementation of $f(R)$ and nDGP theoretical predictions within the
cosmoSIS cosmological inference package. A Fisher analysis reveals that the
vast majority of the constraining power from such a survey comes from the
highest redshift galaxies alone. We further find from a full likelihood
sampling that cosmic shear can achieve 95% CL constraints on the modified
gravity parameters of log$_{10}\left[ f_{R_0}\right] < -5.24$ and
log$_{10}\left[ H_0 r_c\right] > -0.05$, after marginalising over intrinsic

setup could in fact detect with more than $3\sigma$ confidence $f(R)$ values

subdominant role in our error budget. We finally explore the consequences of
analysing data with the wrong gravity model, and report the catastrophic biases

generated over 16,000 synthetic images of TNG50 galaxies designed to match KiDS
observations, including the effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and
used the $\mathrm{\mathtt{statmorph}}$ code to measure various image-based
morphological diagnostics in the $r$-band for both data sets. Such measurements
include the Gini-$M_{20}$ and concentration-asymmetry-smoothness statistics.
Overall, we find good agreement between the optical morphologies of TNG50 and
KiDS galaxies, although the former are slightly more concentrated and
asymmetric than their observational counterparts. Afterwards, we trained a
random forest classifier to identify merging galaxies in the simulation
(including major and minor mergers) using the morphological diagnostics as the

evolution are governed by low-energy cosmic rays. Dark matter with mass
$\gtrsim 4$ MeV can ionize $\text{H}_2$, contributing to the observed
ionization rate. We require that the dark matter-induced ionization rate of
$\text{H}_2$ not exceed the observed cosmic ray ionization rate,
$\zeta^{\text{H}_2}$, in diffuse molecular clouds as well as dense molecular
clouds such as L1551 in the Taurus cloud complex. This allow us to place strong
constraints on the DM-electron cross section, $\bar{\sigma}_e$, that complement
existing astrophysical constraints and probe the strongly interacting parameter
space where terrestrial and underground direct detection experiments lose
sensitivity. We show that constraints from molecular clouds combined with
planned balloon and satellite-based experiments would strongly constrain the
fractional abundance of dark matter that interacts strongly with electrons. We

light curves for a landscape of progenitors from spherically symmetric
neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations using an effective

Remarkably, this allows us to constrain progenitor properties with photometry

Barker et al 2022. The inferred distribution matches extremely well with the

contains high-mass iron cores that suggest contributions from very massive
progenitors in the observational data. We use this distribution of iron core
masses to infer minimum and maximum mass of progenitors in the observational

In this work, we take the first step at resolving this conundrum by introducing
a new class of hydrodynamic stationary states, including an arbitrary zeroth
order electric field, upon which hydrodynamics can be built. We achieve this by
first writing down the hydrostatic constitutive relations for a boost-agnostic
charged fluid up to first order in derivatives. Then we introduce suitable
energy and momentum relaxation terms to balance the influence of the electric
field on the fluid. This analysis leads to a new hydrostatic constraint on the
spatial fluid velocity, which can be used to define our class of states. This
constraint generalizes to the realm of hydrodynamics a similar constraint on
the velocity found in the Drude model of electronic transport. Our class of
states exhibits non-trivial thermo-electric transport even at ideal order,
since it hosts non-zero DC electric and heat currents. We derive the explicit
form of the corresponding conductivities and show they depend non-linearly on

Following a detailed data reduction process implementing several custom steps
to produce high-quality reduced images, we perform multi-band photometry across
seven NIRCam broad and medium-band (and six Hubble broadband) filters focusing
on robust colors and accurate total fluxes. We measure photometric redshifts
and devise a robust set of selection criteria to identify a sample of 26 galaxy
candidates at z~9-16. These objects are compact with a median half-light radius
of ~0.5 kpc. We present an early estimate of the z~11 rest-frame ultraviolet
(UV) luminosity function, finding that the number density of galaxies at M_UV ~
-20 appears to evolve very little from z~9 to z~11. We also find that the
abundance (surface density [arcmin^-2]) of our candidates exceeds nearly all
theoretical predictions. We explore potential implications, including that at
z>10 star formation may be dominated by top-heavy initial mass functions, which
would result in an increased ratio of UV light per unit halo mass, though a
complete lack of dust attenuation and/or changing star-formation physics may
also play a role. While spectroscopic confirmation of these sources is urgently

This arises if the dark matter candidate couples to a confining gauge force

Such Hidden Valley scenarios are being increasingly considered due to
non-detection of minimal models as well as theoretical motivations such as the
Twin Higgs solution to the little hierarchy problem. Study of dark glueballs in
indirect detection has previously been hampered by the difficulty of modeling
their production in dark showers. We use the recent GlueShower code to produce
the first constraints on dark matter annihilating via dark glueballs into the
Standard Model across photon, antiproton, and positron channels. We also fit
the Galactic Centre Excess and use this observation, combined with other
astrophysical constraints, to show how multi-channel observations can constrain
UV and IR details of the theory, namely the exact decay portal and
hadronization behaviour respectively. This provides unique complementary
discovery and diagnostic potential to Hidden Valley searches at colliders. It
is interesting to note that thermal WIMPs annihilating to
$\mathcal{O}(10~\mathrm{GeV})$ dark glueballs and then the Standard Model via
the Twin-Higgs-like decay portal can account for the Galactic Centre Excess

accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), which indicates that EMRIs

migrating in a protoplanetary disk could trap planetesimals close to its orbit,
we study in this paper a similar interaction between a gap-opening IMBH in an
AGN disk and the sBHs surrounding it. We analyse the torques imposed on the
sBHs by the disk as well as by the IMBH, and show that the sBHs can be trapped
by the IMBH if they are inside the orbit of the IMBH. Then we implement the
torques in our numerical simulations to study the migration of an outer IMBH
and an inner sBH, both embedded in an AGN disk. We find that their migration is
synchronized until they reach a distance of about ten Schwarzschild radii from
the central supermassive black hole, where the pair breaks up due to strong GW
radiation. This result indicates that LISA may detect an EMRI and an IMRI

that they could be identified in kinematic surveys. Our results suggest that,

  Heterotic String Theory","49 pages, 6 figures",,,,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Geometric transitions between Calabi-Yau manifolds have proven to be a
powerful tool in exploring the intricate and interconnected vacuum structure of
string compactifications. However, their role in N=1, 4-dimensional string
compactifications remains relatively unexplored. In this work we present a
novel proposal for transitioning the background geometry (including NS5-branes
and holomorphic, slope-stable vector bundles) of 4-dimensional, N=1 heterotic
string compactifications through a conifold transition connecting Calabi-Yau
threefolds. Our proposal is geometric in nature but informed by the heterotic
effective theory. Central to this study is a description of how the cotangent
bundles of the deformation and resolution manifolds in the conifold can be
connected by an apparent small instanton transition with a 5-brane wrapping the
small resolution curves. We show that by a ""pair creation"" process 5-branes can
be generated simultaneously in the gauge and gravitational sectors and used to
describe a coupled minimal change in the manifold and gauge sector. This
observation leads us to propose dualities for 5-branes and gauge bundles in
heterotic conifolds which we then confirm at the level of spectrum in large
classes of examples. While the 5-brane duality is novel, we observe that the
bundle correspondence has appeared before in the Target Space Duality exhibited
by (0,2) GLSMs. Thus our work provides a geometric explanation of (0,2) Target
Space Duality.

discovery of bright thermal optical emission associated with the short GRB
180618A with extended gamma-ray emission, with ultraviolet and optical
multicolour observations starting as soon as 1.4 minutes post-burst. The
spectrum is consistent with a fast-fading afterglow and emerging thermal
optical emission at 15 minutes post-burst, which fades abruptly and
chromatically (flux density $F_{\nu} \propto t^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha=4.6 \pm
0.3$) just 35 minutes after the GRB. Our observations from gamma rays to
optical wavelengths are consistent with a hot nebula expanding at relativistic
speeds, powered by the plasma winds from a newborn, rapidly-spinning and highly

is released at a rate $L_{\rm th} \propto t^{-(2.22\pm 0.14)}$ to reheat the

survive the collapse to a black hole on timescales much larger than a few

physical sense in simulations that do not explicitly treat magnetic fields or
resolved ISM phase structure. We therefore present an intentionally
extremely-simplified 'sub-grid' model for CRs, which attempts to capture the
key qualitative behaviors of greatest interest for those interested in
simulations or semi-analytic models including some approximate CR effects on
galactic (>kpc) scales, while imposing negligible computational overhead. The
model is numerically akin to some recently-developed sub-grid models for
radiative feedback, and allows for a simple constant parameterization of the CR
diffusivity and/or streaming speed; it allows for an arbitrary distribution of
sources (proportional to black hole accretion rates or star-particle SNe rates
or gas/galaxy star formation rates), and interpolates between the limits where
CRs escape the galaxies with negligible losses and those where CRs lose most of
their energy catastrophically before escape (relevant in e.g. starburst
galaxies). The numerical equations are solved trivially alongside gravity in
most codes. We compare this to explicit CR-MHD simulations and discuss where
the (many) sub-grid approximations break down, and what drives the major

follow catalytic activation and charge accumulation following ion exchange

mechanism, whereas at high overpotentials only the latter occurs. These results
provide strategies to promote mechanisms for enhanced OER performances, and

outline a generic way to construct QAOA-like-mixers for these problems. We
further propose a new variational quantum algorithm that incorporates the
underlying group structure more naturally, and implement our new algorithm for

amplitudes during inflation, the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic
field has to be broken by coupling it either to the inflaton or to the scalar
curvature. Couplings to scalar curvature pose certain challenges even in slow
roll inflation and it seems desirable to consider couplings to the inflaton. It
can be shown that, in slow roll inflation, to generate nearly scale invariant
magnetic fields of adequate strengths, the non-conformal coupling to the
inflaton has to be chosen specifically depending on the inflationary model at
hand. In a recent work, we had found that, when there arise sharp departures
from slow roll inflation leading to strong features in the scalar power
spectra, there inevitably arise sharp features in the spectra of the
electromagnetic fields, unless the non-conformal coupling functions are
extremely fine tuned. In particular, we had found that, if there occurs an
epoch of ultra slow roll inflation, then the strength of the magnetic field
over large scales can be severely suppressed. In this work, we examine whether
these challenges can be circumvented in models of inflation involving two
fields. We show that the presence of the additional scalar field allows us to
construct coupling functions that lead to magnetic fields of required strengths
even when there arise intermediate epochs of ultra slow roll inflation.
However, we find that the features in the spectra of the magnetic fields that
are induced due to the departures from slow roll inflation cannot be completely
ironed out. We make use of the code MagCAMB to calculate the effects of the
magnetic fields on the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and
investigate if the spectra with features are broadly consistent with the
current constraints.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art open source infrastructures capable of
conducting such studies are obsolete, poorly supported, or difficult to use, or
their inflexibility limit the types of studies they can conduct.
  We propose DRAM Bender, a new FPGA-based infrastructure that enables
experimental studies on state-of-the-art DRAM chips. DRAM Bender offers three
key features at the same time. First, DRAM Bender enables directly interfacing
with a DRAM chip through its low-level interface. This allows users to issue
DRAM commands in arbitrary order and with finer-grained time intervals compared
to other open source infrastructures. Second, DRAM Bender exposes easy-to-use
C++ and Python programming interfaces, allowing users to quickly and easily
develop different types of DRAM experiments. Third, DRAM Bender is easily
extensible. The modular design of DRAM Bender allows extending it to (i)
support existing and emerging DRAM interfaces, and (ii) run on new commercial
or custom FPGA boards with little effort.
  To demonstrate that DRAM Bender is a versatile infrastructure, we conduct
three case studies, two of which lead to new observations about the DRAM
RowHammer vulnerability. In particular, we show that data patterns supported by
DRAM Bender uncovers a larger set of bit-flips on a victim row compared to the
data patterns commonly used by prior work. We demonstrate the extensibility of
DRAM Bender by implementing it on five different FPGAs with DDR4 and DDR3
support. DRAM Bender is freely and openly available at

a double-layer system, in which two binary condensates, stabilized by the SOC,
are linearly coupled by tunneling. By means of the numerical methods, it is
found that symmetric two-layer solitons undergo the
spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) bifurcation of the subcritical type. The
bifurcation produces families of asymmetric 2D solitons, which exist up to the
value of the total norm equal to the norm of the Townes solitons, above which
the collapse occurs. This situation terminates at a critical value of the
inter-layer coupling, beyond which the SSB bifurcation is absent, as the
collapse sets in earlier. Symmetric 2D solitons that are destabilized by the
SSB demonstrate dynamical symmetry breaking, in combination with intrinsic
oscillations of the solitons, or transition to the collapse, if the soliton's
norm is sufficiently large. Asymmetric MMs produced by the SSB instability
start spontaneous drift, in addition to the intrinsic vibrations. Consideration
of moving 2D solitons is a nontrivial problem because SOC breaks the Galilean
invariance. It is found that the system supports moving MMs up to a critical
value of the velocity, beyond which they undergo delocalization.

two-fold fragmented many-body state which is related to intra-band excitation
processes of the impurity and manifests as a two-body phase separation

Increasing the postquench impurity-bath coupling strength leads to the
destruction of the two-fold fragmentation since the impurity undergoes
additional inter-band excitation dynamics. By contrast, a weakly interacting
bath suppresses excitations of the bath particles and consequently the system
attains a weakly fragmented many-body state. Our results explicate the

state-of-the-art PLMs address this need, they have been limited to only
evaluating lexical equality of single- or multi-word answers and do not address
consistency of generative text sequences. In order to understand consistency of
PLMs under text generation settings, we develop a measure of semantic
consistency that allows the comparison of open-ended text outputs. We implement
several versions of this consistency metric to evaluate the performance of a
number of PLMs on paraphrased versions of questions in the TruthfulQA dataset,
we find that our proposed metrics are considerably more consistent than
traditional metrics embodying lexical consistency, and also correlate with
human evaluation of output consistency to a higher degree.

the high voltage (HV) grids plays a more critical and significant role in grid
congestion management in TSO grids. This work proposed a multi-stage deep
reinforcement learning approach to estimate the PQ flexibility (PQ area) at the
TSO-DSO interfaces and identifies the DER PQ setpoints for each operating point
in a way, that DERs in the meshed HV grid can be coordinated to offer
flexibility for the transmission grid. In the estimation process, we consider
the steady-state grid limits and the robustness in the resulting voltage
profile against uncertainties and the N-1 security criterion regarding thermal
line loading, essential for real-life grid operational planning applications.
Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for PQ flexibility estimation is the
first of its kind. Furthermore, our approach of considering N-1 security
criterion for meshed grids and robustness against uncertainty directly in the
optimization tasks offers a new perspective besides the common relaxation
schema in finding a solution with mathematical optimal power flow (OPF).
Finally, significant improvements in the computational efficiency in estimation

data streams' ingestion, storage, and processing over the past decade. Layered
streaming architectures integrate pull-based read and push-based write RPC
mechanisms implemented by stream ingestion/storage systems. In addition, stream
processing engines expose source/sink interfaces, allowing them to decouple
these systems easily. However, open-source streaming engines leverage workflow
sources implemented through a pull-based approach, continuously issuing read
RPCs towards the stream ingestion/storage, effectively competing with write
RPCs. This paper proposes a unified streaming architecture that leverages
push-based and/or pull-based source implementations for integrating
ingestion/storage and processing engines that can reduce processing latency and
increase system read and write throughput while making room for higher
ingestion. We implement a novel push-based streaming source by replacing
continuous pull-based RPCs with one single RPC and shared memory (storage and
processing handle streaming data through pointers to shared objects). To this
end, we conduct an experimental analysis of pull-based versus push-based design
alternatives of the streaming source reader while considering a set of stream

apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. The advent of wide-field surveys
at many wavelengths has quickly increased the number of tidal disruption events
(TDEs) observed, and has revealed that i) observed TDE rates are lower than
theoretical predictions and ii) E+A galaxies are significantly overrepresented.
This overrepresentation further worsens the tension between observed and
theoretically predicted TDEs for non-E+A galaxies. Classical loss cone theory
focuses on the cumulative effect of many weak scatterings. However, a strong
scattering can remove a star from the distribution before it can get tidally
disrupted. Most stars undergoing TDEs come from within the radius of influence,
the densest environments of the universe. In such environments, close
encounters rare elsewhere become non-negligible. We revise the standard loss
cone theory to take into account classical two-body interactions as well as
strong scattering, collisions, tidal captures, and study under which conditions
close encounters can shield the loss cone. We i) analytically derive the impact
of strong scattering and other close encounters, ii) compute time-dependent
loss cone dynamics including both weak and strong encounters, and iii) derive
analytical solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation with strong scattering. We
find that i) TDE rates can be reduced to up to an order of magnitude and ii)
strong shielding preferentially reduces deeply plunging stars. We also show
that stellar overdensities, one possible explanation for the E+A preference,
can fail to increase TDE rates when taking into account strong scattering.

are expelled from the vortex all the way to a well-defined depletion zone

investigate the dynamics of elongated microswimmers in elementary vortices,
namely active particles in two- and three-dimensional rotlets. A deterministic
model first reveals the existence of bounded orbits near the centre of the
vortex and unbounded orbits elsewhere. We further discover a conserved quantity
of motion that allows us to map the phase space according to the type of the
orbit (bounded vs unbounded). We next introduce translational and rotational
noise into the system. Using a Fokker--Planck formalism, we quantify the
quality of trapping near the centre of the vortex by examining the probability
of escape and the mean time of escape from the region of deterministically
bounded orbits. We finally show how to use these findings to formulate a
prediction for the radius of the depletion zone, which compares favourably with
the experiments of Sokolov and Aranson (2016).

reproduce the experimentally observed centrality dependence of the balance
function widths at the relatively low transverse momentum intervals
qualitatively due to the different charge creation mechanisms in soft and hard
processes. However, the fully adequate description of the balance function in
these intervals implies the essential model modification by including the exact
charge conservation in terms of the canonical ensemble instead of the grand
canonical one. A procedure is proposed for introducing charge correlations into
the thermal model without changing other model parameters. With increasing
transverse momenta, the default model results describe experimental data much
better because the contribution from the soft component of the model is
significantly reduced in these transverse momentum intervals. In practice,
there is a transition to a single source of charge correlations, namely, charge
correlations in jets for which the exact charge conservation takes place at
each stage.

particularly with respect to grain morphology which typically features
heterogeneous grain size distribution, anomalous and anisotropic grain shapes,
and the so-called columnar grains. In general, the conventional morphological
descriptors are not suitable to represent complex and anisotropic grain
morphology of AM microstructures. The principal aspect of microstructural grain
morphology is the state of grain boundary spacing or grain size whose effect on
the mechanical response is known to be crucial. In this paper, we formally
introduce the notions of axial grain size and grain size anisotropy as robust
morphological descriptors which can concisely represent highly complex grain
morphologies. We instantiated a discrete sample of polycrystalline aggregate as
a representative volume element (RVE) which has random crystallographic
orientation and misorientation distributions. However, the instantiated RVE
incorporates the typical morphological features of AM microstructures including
distinctive grain size heterogeneity and anisotropic grain size owing to its
pronounced columnar grain morphology. We ensured that any anisotropy arising in
the macroscopic mechanical response of the instantiated sample is mainly
associated with its underlying anisotropic grain size. The RVE was then used
for meso-scale full-field crystal plasticity simulations corresponding to
uniaxial tensile deformation along different axes via a spectral solver and a
physics-based crystal plasticity constitutive model. Through the numerical
analyses, we were able to isolate the contribution of anisotropic grain size to
the anisotropy in the mechanical response of polycrystalline aggregates,
particularly those with the characteristic complex grain morphology of AM
metals. Such a contribution can be described by an inverse square relation.

it. It is based on nodal degrees of freedom that account for the intersection
between the perforations and the subdomain boundaries. As a reference, we
compare this coarse space to the well-studied Nicolaides coarse space with the
same subdomain partitioning. It is known that the Nicolaides space is unable to
prevent stagnation in convergence when the subdomains are not connected; we
work around this issue by separating each subdomain by disconnected component.
Scalability and robustness are tested for multiple data sets based on realistic
urban topography. Numerical results show that the new coarse space is very
robust and accelerates the number of Krylov iterations when compared to
Nicolaides, independent of the complexity of the data.

we have run a large suite of test particle simulations at unprecedentedly low

also developed an analytical model, based on (1) initial particle transport

equidistributes on average over a genus of the narrow class group as the
fundamental discriminant $D$ of the real quadratic field tends to infinity.
  We extend this construction of hyperbolic orbifolds to allow for a level
structure, akin to Heegner points and closed geodesics of level $q$.
Additionally, we refine this equidistribution result in several directions.
First, we investigate sparse equidistribution in the level aspect, where we
prove the equidistribution of level $q$ hyperbolic orbifolds when restricted to
a translate of $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$ in $\Gamma_0(q) \backslash

these equidistribution problems in terms of ad\`elic period integrals, which in
turn are related to Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions via Waldspurger's formula. The
key remaining inputs are hybrid subconvex bounds for these $L$-functions and a

shortest tour $T$ that gets within Euclidean distance 1 of every point in $P$;
this is equivalent to computing a shortest tour for a unit-disk cutter $C$ that
covers all of $P$. As a geometric optimization problem of natural practical and
theoretical importance, the LMP generalizes and combines several notoriously
difficult problems, including minimum covering by disks, the Traveling Salesman
Problem with neighborhoods (TSPN), and the Art Gallery Problem (AGP).
  In this paper, we conduct the first study of the Lawn Mowing Problem with a
focus on practical computation of near-optimal solutions. We provide new
theoretical insights: Optimal solutions are polygonal paths with a bounded
number of vertices, allowing a restriction to straight-line solutions; on the
other hand, there can be relatively simple instances for which optimal
solutions require a large class of irrational coordinates. On the practical
side, we present a primal-dual approach with provable convergence properties
based on solving a special case of the TSPN restricted to witness sets. In each
iteration, this establishes both a valid solution and a valid lower bound, and
thereby a bound on the remaining optimality gap. As we demonstrate in an
extensive computational study, this allows us to achieve provably optimal and
near-optimal solutions for a large spectrum of benchmark instances with up to

dispersion, similar to what is predicted by the ion-sound turbulence theory. It
is shown that, in the PIC and Vlasov simulations, the inverse cascade coincides
with the formation and merging of electron structures in phase space. This
process, however, terminates differently in the PIC simulations compared with
the Vlasov simulations. Larger amplitudes of ECDI fluctuations are observed in
the PIC simulations compared with the Vlasov simulations, leading to an
intensified electron heating and anomalous current. This suggests that the
statistical noise of PIC simulations might contribute to the extreme electron
heating that has been observed in previous studies.

conservation, at the numerical level, of the mass, energy and Hamiltonian that
are conserved by exact solutions of all KdV equations. To our knowledge, this
is the first DG method that conserves all these three quantities, a property
critical for the accurate long-time evolution of solitary waves. To achieve the
desired conservation properties, our novel idea is to introduce two
stabilization parameters in the numerical fluxes as new unknowns which then
allow us to enforce the conservation of energy and Hamiltonian in the
formulation of the numerical scheme. We prove the conservation properties of
the scheme which are corroborated by numerical tests. This idea of achieving
conservation properties by implicitly defining penalization parameters, that
are traditionally specified a priori, can serve as a framework for designing
physics-preserving numerical methods for other types of problems.

some maximum timestamp is negated, reducing the time complexity from at least
O(n log(n)) towards O(n) and improving query execution times. We illustrate

received by the planets is strong and highly variable, and has consequences for
atmospheric loss, composition, and habitability.
  SPARCS is a NASA-funded mission to characterize the quiescent and flare UV
emission from low-mass stars, by observing 10 to 20 low-mass stars, over
timescales of days, simultaneously in two UV bands: 153-171 nm and 260-300 nm.
SPARCS Sun-synchronous terminator orbit allows for long periods of
uninterrupted observations, reaching 10s of days for some targets. The payload
consists of a 10 cm-class telescope, a dichroic element, UV detectors and
associated electronics, a thermal control system, and an on-board processor.
The payload is hosted on a Blue Canyon Technologies 6U CubeSat.
  SPARCS hosts several technology innovations that have broad applicability to
other missions. The payload demonstrates the use of ""2D-doped"" (i.e., delta-
and superlattice-doped) detectors and detector-integrated metal dielectric
filters in space. This detector technology provides ~5x larger quantum
efficiency than NASA's GALEX detectors. In addition, SPARCS' payload processor
provides dynamic exposure control, automatically adjusting the exposure time to
avoid flare saturation and to time-resolve the strongest stellar flares. A
simple passive cooling system maintains the detector temperature under 238K to
minimize dark current. The spacecraft bus provides pointing jitter smaller than
6"", minimizing the impact of flat-field errors, dark current, and read-noise.
All these elements enable competitive astrophysics science within a CubeSat
platform.
  SPARCS is currently in the final design and fabrication phase (Phase C in the
NASA context). It will be launched in 2024, for a primary science mission of
one year.

regions is one of the key mechanisms that drive the evolution of
star-planet/planet-moon systems. In this context, the interaction between tidal
inertial waves and turbulent convective flows must be modelled in a realistic
and robust way. In the state-of-the-art simulations, the friction applied by
convection on tidal waves is modelled most of the time by an effective
eddy-viscosity. This approach may be valid when the characteristic length
scales of convective eddies are smaller than those of tidal waves. However, it
becomes highly questionable in the case where tidal waves interact with
potentially stable large-scale vortices, as those observed at the pole of
Jupiter and Saturn. They are potentially triggered by convection in
rapidly-rotating bodies in which the Coriolis acceleration forms the flow in
columnar vortical structures along the direction of the rotation axis. In this
paper, we investigate the complex interactions between a tidal inertial wave
and a columnar convective vortex. We use a quasi-geostrophic semi-analytical
model of a convective columnar vortex. We perform linear stability analysis to
identify the unstable regime and conduct linear numerical simulations for the
interactions between the convective vortex and an incoming tidal inertial wave.
We verify that in the unstable regime, an incoming tidal inertial wave triggers
the most unstable mode of the vortex leading to turbulent dissipation. For
stable vortices, the wave-vortex interaction leads to the momentum mixing while
it creates a low-velocity region around the vortex core and a new wave-like
perturbation in the form of a progressive wave radiating in the far field. The
emission of this secondary wave is the strongest when the wavelength of the
incoming wave is close to the characteristic size of the vortex.

whereas a pair of immediately heavier neutralinos and the lighter chargino are
higgsino-like with masses in the range $\sim 500$ GeV -- 1 TeV. Further, the
singlet-like scalar present in the spectrum provides a funnel for a rapid
enough mutual annihilation of the LSP thus making the latter meet the

its ability to offer a bino-like dark matter with such a mass unlike what is
now disfavored in the MSSM while avoiding the stringent lower bounds from the
LHC experiments on the masses of these involved particles and still remaining
reasonably `natural'. We find that while a usual cut-based analysis (CBA) on

This dissertation studies the root causes of inefficiency of irregular
applications in modern computing systems, and fundamentally addresses such
inefficiencies, by proposing low-overhead synchronization techniques among
parallel threads in cooperation with well-crafted data access policies.
  We make four major contributions to accelerating irregular applications in
different contexts including CPU and Near-Data-Processing (NDP) (or
Processing-In-Memory (PIM)) systems. First, we design ColorTM, a novel parallel
graph coloring algorithm for CPU systems that trades off using synchronization
with lower data access costs. Second, we propose SmartPQ, an adaptive priority
queue that achieves high performance under all various contention scenarios in
Non-Uniform Memory Access CPU systems. Third, we introduce SynCron, the first
practical hardware synchronization mechanism tailored for NDP systems. Fourth,
we design SparseP, the first library for high-performance Sparse Matrix Vector
Multiplication on real PIM systems.
  We demonstrate that the execution of irregular applications in CPU and
NDP/PIM architectures can be significantly accelerated by co-designing
lightweight synchronization approaches along with well-crafted data access
policies. This dissertation bridges the gap between processor-centric CPU
systems and memory-centric PIM systems in the critically-important area of
irregular applications. We hope that this dissertation inspires future work in
co-designing software algorithms with cutting-edge computing platforms to

  systems: an approach based on constrained zonotopes and DC programming","9 pages, 2 Figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new state estimator for discrete-time nonlinear
dynamical systems with unknown-but-bounded uncertainties and state linear
inequality and nonlinear equality constraints. Our algorithm is based on
constrained zonotopes (CZs) and on a DC programming approach (DC stands for
difference of convex functions). Recently, mean value extension and first-order
Taylor extension have been adapted from zonotopes to propagate CZs over
nonlinear mappings. Although the resulting algorithms (called CZMV and CZFO)
reach better precision than the original zonotopic versions, they carry the
sensitivity to the wrapping and dependency effects inherited from interval
arithmetic. These interval issues can be mitigated with DC programming since
the approximation error bounds are obtained solving optimization problems. A
direct benefit of this technique is the elimination of the dependency effect.
Our set-membership filter (called CZDC) offers an alternative solution to CZMV
and CZFO. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
CZDC is experimented over two numerical examples.

relaxation rates ($1/T_1$) shows a clear peak around N\'eel temperature,
$T_{\rm N} = 10.9$~K, corresponding to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition.
From the temparature dependence of NMR shift ($K$) above $T_{\rm N}$, an
exchange coupling between Fe$^{3+}$ spins was estimated to be $J/k_{\rm
B}\simeq 1.9$~K using the spin-5/2 Heisenberg isotropic-TL model. The
temperature dependence of $1/T_1T$ divided by the magnetic susceptibility
($\chi$), $1/T_1T\chi$, above $T_{\rm N}$ proves the AFM nature of spin
fluctuations below $\sim$ 50 K in the paramagnetic state. In the magnetically
ordered state below $T_{\rm N}$, the characteristic rectangular shape of the
NMR spectra is observed, indicative of a commensurate AFM state in its ground
state. The strong temperature dependence of 1/$T_1$ in the AFM state is well
explained by the two-magnon (Raman) process of the spin waves in a 3D
antiferromagnet with a spin-anisotropy energy gap of 5.7 K. The temperature
dependence of sublattice magnetization is also well reproduced by the spin
waves. Those results indicate that the magnetically ordered state of

frustration effects were detected in its ground state.

sensorimotor control have assumed that sensory information from the environment
leads to actions, which then act back on the environment, creating a single,
unidirectional perception-action loop. This loop contains internal delays in
sensory and motor pathways, which can lead to unstable control. We show here
that these delays can be compensated by internal feedback signals that flow
backwards, from motor towards sensory areas. Internal feedback is ubiquitous in
neural sensorimotor systems and recent advances in control theory show how
internal feedback compensates internal delays. This is accomplished by
filtering out self-generated and other predictable changes in early sensory
areas so that unpredicted, actionable information can be rapidly transmitted
toward action by the fastest components. For example, fast, giant neurons are
necessarily less accurate than smaller neurons, but they are crucial for fast
and accurate behavior. We use a mathematically tractable control model to show
that internal feedback has an indispensable role in achieving state estimation,
localization of function -- how different parts of cortex control different
parts of the body -- and attention, all of which are crucial for effective
sensorimotor control. This control model can explain anatomical, physiological
and behavioral observations, including motor signals in visual cortex,
heterogeneous kinetics of sensory receptors and the presence of giant Betz
cells in motor cortex, Meynert cells in visual cortex and giant von Economo
cells in the prefrontal cortex of humans as well as internal feedback patterns

eigenfunctions at a band touching point with an adjacent dispersive band,
thereby requiring additional extended states to span their eigenmode space. In
this study, we design and numerically demonstrate two-dimensional thin-plate
acoustic metamaterials in which tunable flat bands of both kinds can be
achieved. Non-singular flat bands are achieved by fine-tuning the ratio of the
global tension and the bending stiffness in triangular and honeycomb lattices
of plate resonators. A singular flat band arises in a kagome lattice due to the
underlying lattice geometry, which can be made degenerate with two additional
flat bands by tuning the plate tension. A discrete model of the continuum
thin-plate system reveals the interplay of geometric and mechanical factors in
determining the existence of flat bands of both types. The singular nature of
the kagome lattice flat band is established via a metric called the
Hilbert-Schmidt distance calculated between a pair of eigenstates
infinitesimally close to the quadratic band touching point. We also simulate an
acoustic manifestation of a robust boundary mode arising from the singular flat
band and protected by real-space topology in a finite system. Our theoretical
and computational study establishes a framework for exploring flat-band physics
in a tunable classical system, and for designing acoustic metamaterials with

are measured in the first phase, and a new predictor of interest, which may be
costly to collect, can be measured on a subsample in the second phase, without
incurring the costs of recruiting subjects. By using the information gathered
in the first phase, the second-phase subsample can be selected to enhance the

the user side, a microgrid is mainly faced with the problems of small-scale
volatility, uncertainty, intermittency and demand-side uncertainty of DERs. The
traditional microgrid has a single form and cannot meet the flexible energy
dispatch between the complex demand side and the microgrid. In response to this
problem, the overall environment of wind power, thermostatically controlled
loads, energy storage systems, price-responsive loads and the main grid is
proposed. Secondly, the centralized control of the microgrid operation is
convenient for the control of the reactive power and voltage of the distributed
power supply and the adjustment of the grid frequency. However, there is a
problem in that the flexible loads aggregate and generate peaks during the
electricity price valley. The existing research takes into account the power
constraints of the microgrid and fails to ensure a sufficient supply of
electric energy for a single flexible load. This paper considers the response
priority of each unit component of TCLs and ESSs on the basis of the overall
environment operation of the microgrid so as to ensure the power supply of the
flexible load of the microgrid and save the power input cost to the greatest
extent. Finally, the simulation optimization of the environment can be
expressed as a Markov decision process process. It combines two stages of
offline and online operations in the training process. The addition of multiple
threads with the lack of historical data learning leads to low learning
efficiency. The asynchronous advantage actor-critic with the experience replay
pool memory library is added to solve the data correlation and nonstatic
distribution problems during training.

meta-analysis of test accuracy require specialised knowledge to implement, with
the necessary level of expertise having recently increased. This is due to the
development and recommendation to use more sophisticated methods; such as those
in Version 2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test
Accuracy. This paper describes a web-based application that extends the
functionality of previous applications, making many advanced analysis methods
more accessible.
  Methods: We sought to create an extended, stand-alone, Bayesian version of
MetaDTA, which (i) has the benefits of previously proposed applications and
addresses key limitations of them, (ii) is accessible to researchers who do not
have the specific expertise required to fit such models, and (iii) is suitable
for experienced analysts. We created the application using Shiny and Stan.
  Results: We created MetaBayesDTA (https://crsu.shinyapps.io/MetaBayesDTA/),
which allows users to conduct meta-analysis of test accuracy, with or without a
gold standard. The application addresses several key limitations of other
applications. For instance, for the bivariate model, one can conduct subgroup
analysis, univariate meta-regression, and comparative test accuracy evaluation.
Meanwhile, for the model which does not assume a perfect gold standard, the
application can account for the fact that studies use different reference
tests.
  Conclusions: Due to its user-friendliness and broad array of features,
MetaBayesDTA should appeal to a wide variety of researchers. We anticipate that
the application will encourage wider use of more advanced methods, which
ultimately should improve the quality of test accuracy reviews.

optimization (LSO), a deep generative model is trained to embed discrete neural
architectures into a continuous latent space. In this case, different
optimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented
to search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables
is challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space
to the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this
problem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization
(CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space
in order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically,
CR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous
representations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process
of latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex
neural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex
mapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance.
Hereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and
leverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture
representations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that
CR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational
complexity and architecture performance.

We make a comparison for the impacts of the dynamical dark energy on the
cosmological constraints on the total mass of active neutrinos. We find that
the dark energy properties could significantly change the fitting results of
neutrino mass. Looser constraints on $\sum m_{\nu}$ are obtained in the

modular surface M, whose unit tangent bundle U is a 3-manifold homeomorphic to
the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere. The hyperbolic conjugacy
classes of PSL(2;Z) correspond to the closed oriented geodesics in M. Those
lift to the periodic orbits for the geodesic flow in U, which define the
modular knots. The linking numbers between modular knots and the trefoil is
well understood. Indeed, Etienne Ghys showed in 2006 that they are given by the
Rademacher invariant of the corresponding conjugacy classes. The Rademacher
function is a homogeneous quasi-morphism of PSL(2;Z) which he had recognised
with Jean Barge in 1992 as half the primitive of the bounded euler class. This
shed light on the 1987 work of Michael Atiyah concerning the logarithm of the
Dedekind eta function which identified it with no less than that six other
important functions appearing in diverse areas of mathematics. We are concerned
with the linking numbers between modular knots and derive several formulae with
arithmetical, combinatorial, topological and group theoretical flavours. In
particular we associate to a pair of modular knots a function defined on the
character variety of PSL(2;Z), whose limit at the boundary point recovers their
linking number. Moreover, we show that the linking number with a modular knot
minus that with its inverse yields a homogeneous quasi-morphism on the modular
group, and how to extract a free basis out of these. For this we prove that the
linking pairing is non degenerate.

consistent event annotation for multiple languages. There exist some
multilingual ED datasets; however, they tend to cover a handful of languages
and mainly focus on popular ones. Many languages are not covered in existing
multilingual ED datasets. In addition, the current datasets are often small and
not accessible to the public. To overcome those shortcomings, we introduce a
new large-scale multilingual dataset for ED (called MINION) that consistently
annotates events for 8 different languages; 5 of them have not been supported
by existing multilingual datasets. We also perform extensive experiments and
analysis to demonstrate the challenges and transferability of ED across

consensus over connected graphs in a discrete-time communication setting.
Literature has shown that consensus algorithms can be accelerated by increasing
the graph connectivity or optimizing the weights agents place on the
information received from their neighbors. Here, instead of altering the
communication graph, we investigate two methods that use buffered states to
accelerate reaching average consensus over a given graph. In the first method,
we study how convergence rate of the well-known first-order Laplacian average
consensus algorithm changes when agreement feedback is generated from buffered
states. For this study, we obtain a sufficient condition on the ranges of
buffered state that leads to faster convergence. In the second proposed method,
we show how the average consensus problem can be cast as a convex optimization
problem and solved by first-order accelerated optimization algorithms for
strongly-convex cost functions. We construct an accelerated average consensus
algorithm using the so-called Triple Momentum optimization algorithm. The first
approach requires less global knowledge for choosing the step size, whereas the
second one converges faster in our numerical results by using extra information
from the graph topology. We demonstrate our results by implementing the
proposed algorithms in a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) estimation problem used
in sensor networks.

it difficult to understand how source language inputs are being mapped to the
target language. To solve this problem, we would like to simultaneously
generate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and ST predictions such that each
source language word is explicitly mapped to a target language word. A major
challenge arises from the fact that translation is a non-monotonic sequence
transduction task due to word ordering differences between languages -- this
clashes with the monotonic nature of ASR. Therefore, we propose to generate ST
tokens out-of-order while remembering how to re-order them later. We achieve
this by predicting a sequence of tuples consisting of a source word, the
corresponding target words, and post-editing operations dictating the correct
insertion points for the target word. We examine two variants of such operation
sequences which enable generation of monotonic transcriptions and non-monotonic
translations from the same speech input simultaneously. We apply our approach
to offline and real-time streaming models, demonstrating that we can provide
explainable translations without sacrificing quality or latency. In fact, the
delayed re-ordering ability of our approach improves performance during
streaming. As an added benefit, our method performs ASR and ST simultaneously,
making it faster than using two separate systems to perform these tasks.

between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and A-type antiferromagnetism can induce
layer-polarized anomalous valley Hall (LP-AVH) effect. The K and -K valleys of
FVM are both metallic, and electron and hole carriers simultaneously exist. In
the extreme case, the FVM can become VGS by analogizing spin gapless

enhancement and valley polarization reversal can be achieved by electric field

enhance valley splitting, and the valley polarization can be reversed by
flipping electric field direction. To effectively tune valley properties by
electric field in bilayer systems, the parent monolayer should possess
out-of-plane magnetization, and have large valley splitting. Our results shed

contention of memory bandwidth between application processes and network
processes. This contention leads to frequent packet drops at the NIC of
receiving hosts, which triggers the congestion control mechanism of the network
and eventually results in network performance degradation.
  To tackle this problem, we make a key observation that given the distributed
storage service, the vast majority of data it receives from the network will be
eventually written to high-speed storage media (e.g., SSD) by CPU. As such, we
propose to bypass host memory when processing received data to completely

Results show that for distributed storage applications, Lamda improves network
throughput by 4.7% with zero memory bandwidth consumption on storage nodes, and
improves network throughput by up 17% and 45% for large block size and small

develop a general theory for the intrinsic IPHE, highlighting a previously

anomalous orbital polarizability (AOP). Importantly, the orbital mechanism does
not request spin-orbit coupling, so sizable IPHE can occur and is dominated by
the orbital contribution in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. Combined
with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate our theory with quantitative
evaluation of the effect in bulk materials $\mathrm{TaSb_{2}}$,

of non-idealities and show that the gate is viable for implementation in

discoveries. In fact, the black hole entropy is a nonextensive quantity that
scales by its surface area at the event horizon. In our work, we extend the
thermodynamic phase space of black holes by treating the nonextensive parameter
of the R\'enyi entropy as the thermodynamic variable. Using Euler's theorem for
a homogeneous function of the black holes' mass, the compatible Smarr formula
and the first law of black hole thermodynamics can be obtained. It is also
demonstrated that, by keeping the same form of the black hole mass, the R\'enyi
temperature is straightforwardly defined as proposed in the literature. Since
many different types of black holes can indeed be successfully treated with
such a procedure, our consideration is fairly general. It is worthwhile to
argue that the black hole thermodynamics in R\'enyi statistics is rooted from
the relation among geometric quantities in the same way as the standard
approach corresponding to the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. Even though our
results are based on classical gravity, they may pave the way to derive the

matter deficient galaxies (DMDGs), in the vicinity of NGC1052 formed because of
a high-speed collision between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies, one bound to
NGC1052 and the other one on an unbound orbit. The collision compresses the gas
reservoirs of the colliding galaxies, which in turn triggers a burst of star
formation. In contrast, the dark matter and pre-existing stars in the
progenitor galaxies pass through it. Since the high pressures in the compressed
gas are conducive to the formation of massive globular clusters (GCs), this
scenario can explain the formation of DMDGs with large populations of massive
GCs, consistent with the observations of NGC1052-DF2 (DF2) and NGC1052-DF4. A
potential difficulty with this `mini bullet cluster' scenario is that the
observed spatial distributions of GCs in DMDGs are extended. GCs experience
dynamical friction causing their orbits to decay with time. Consequently, their
distribution at formation should have been even more extended than that
observed at present. Using a semi-analytic model, we show that the observed
positions and velocities of the GCs in DF2 imply that they must have formed at
a radial distance of 5-10kpc from the center of DF2. However, as we
demonstrate, the scenario is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the
strong tidal forces from NGC1052 strip the extendedly distributed GCs from DF2,
requiring 33-59 massive GCs to form at the collision to explain observations.

spectral range of 0.8--2.5 $\mu$m. Using this sample, we explore the NIR
spectral diversity of SNe Ia and construct a template of spectral time series
as a function of the light-curve-shape parameter, color stretch $s_{BV}$.
Principal component analysis is applied to characterize the diversity of the
spectral features and reduce data dimensionality to a smaller subspace.
Gaussian process regression is then used to model the subspace dependence on
phase and light-curve shape and the associated uncertainty. Our template is
able to predict spectral variations that are correlated with $s_{BV}$, such as
the hallmark NIR features: Mg II at early times and the $H$-band break after
peak. Using this template reduces the systematic uncertainties in K-corrections
by ~90% compared to those from the Hsiao template. These uncertainties, defined
as the mean K-correction differences computed with the color-matched template
and observed spectra, are on the level of $4\times10^{-4}$ mag on average. This
template can serve as the baseline spectral energy distribution for light-curve
fitters and can identify peculiar spectral features that might point to
compelling physics. The results presented here will substantially improve
future SN~Ia cosmological experiments, for both nearby and distant samples.

both fast and accurate. However, mainstream equivalent circuit models and
electrochemical models have yet to meet this need well, due to struggle with
either predictive accuracy or computational complexity. This problem has
acquired urgency as some emerging battery applications running across broad
current ranges, e.g., electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, can
hardly find usable models from the literature. Motivated to address the
problem, we develop an innovative model in this study. Called BattX, the model
is an equivalent circuit model but draws comparisons to a single particle model
with electrolyte and thermal dynamics, thus combining their respective merits
to be computationally efficient, accurate, and physically interpretable. The
model design pivots on leveraging multiple circuits to approximate major
electrochemical and physical processes in charging/discharging. Given the
model, we develop a multipronged approach to design experiments and identify
its parameters in groups from experimental data. Experimental validation proves
that the BattX model is capable of accurate voltage prediction for
charging/discharging across low to high C-rates.

transverse axis $x$, the quantization axis for the atomic internal states is
the other orthogonal transverse axis $y$, the atomic upper and lower levels are
the magnetic sublevels $M'$ and $M$ of hyperfine-structure levels of an
alkali-metal atom, and the field is in a quasilinearly polarized fundamental
guided mode HE$_{11}$ with the polarization $\xi=x$ or $y$. We find that the
absolute value of the quadrupole Rabi frequency depends on the propagation
direction of the light field in the cases of ($M'-M=\pm1$, $\xi=y$) and
($M'-M=\pm2$, $\xi=x$). We show that the directional dependence of the coupling

We find that the directional dependence of the atom-field coupling in the case

(STCN)-based parameter passing. Through the fusion of multiple decoding
methods, muti-camera targets are tracked in three dimensions: temporal logic,
spatial logic, and feature matching. For the MOT17 dataset, this study's method
significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art method MiniTrackV2 [49]

Furthermore, this study proposes a retrospective mechanism for the first time,

mislabeled targets for improving the Identification F1-score(IDF1). For the
self-built dataset OVIT-MOT01, the IDF1 improves from 0.948 to 0.967, and the

interstellar medium (ISM) properties within individual HII regions across the
entire star-forming disks of nearby galaxies. This can provide key insights
into the spatial distribution and resolved properties of the ISM to understand
how efficiently metals are mixed and redistributed across spirals and dwarf

spiral galaxies as part of the TYPHOON program from Grasha et al. (2022). We
use HIIPhot to identify the HII regions within the galaxy based on the surface
brightness of the H-alpha emission line and measure variations of the HII
region oxygen abundance. In this initial work, we find that while the spiral
pattern plays a role in organizing the ISM, it alone does not establish the
relatively uniform azimuthal variations we observe across all the galaxies.
Differences in the metal abundances are more likely driven by the strong
correlations with the local physical conditions. We find a strong and positive
correlation between the ionization parameter and the local abundances as
measured by the relative metallicity offset $\Delta$(O/H), indicating a tight
relationship between local physical conditions and their localized enrichment
of the ISM. These variations can be explained by a combination of localized,
star formation-driven self-enrichment and large-scale mixing-driven dilution
due to the passing of spiral density waves.

emerged as a powerful strategy for semi-supervised learning in speech
recognition. In contrast with earlier strategies that alternated between
training a model and generating pseudo-labels (PLs) with it, here PLs are
generated in end-to-end manner as training proceeds, improving training speed
and the accuracy of the final model. PL shares a common theme with
teacher-student models such as distillation in that a teacher model generates
targets that need to be mimicked by the student model being trained. However,
interestingly, PL strategies in general use hard-labels, whereas distillation
uses the distribution over labels as the target to mimic. Inspired by
distillation we expect that specifying the whole distribution (aka soft-labels)
over sequences as the target for unlabeled data, instead of a single best pass
pseudo-labeled transcript (hard-labels) should improve PL performance and
convergence. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, we find that soft-labels targets
can lead to training divergence, with the model collapsing to a degenerate
token distribution per frame. We hypothesize that the reason this does not
happen with hard-labels is that training loss on hard-labels imposes
sequence-level consistency that keeps the model from collapsing to the
degenerate solution. In this paper, we show several experiments that support
this hypothesis, and experiment with several regularization approaches that can
ameliorate the degenerate collapse when using soft-labels. These approaches can
bring the accuracy of soft-labels closer to that of hard-labels, and while they
are unable to outperform them yet, they serve as a useful framework for further
improvements.

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2202.04148",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The high mobility, density and multi-path evident in modern wireless systems
makes the channel highly non-stationary. This causes temporal variation in the
channel distribution that leads to the existence of time-varying joint
interference across multiple degrees of freedom (DoF, e.g., users, antennas,
frequency and symbols), which renders conventional precoding sub-optimal in
practice. In this work, we derive a High-Order Generalization of Mercer's
Theorem (HOGMT), which decomposes the multi-user non-stationary channel into
two (dual) sets of jointly orthogonal subchannels (eigenfunctions), that result
in the other set when one set is transmitted through the channel. This duality
and joint orthogonality of eigenfuntions ensure transmission over independently
flat-fading subchannels. Consequently, transmitting these eigenfunctions with
optimally derived coefficients eventually mitigates any interference across its
degrees of freedoms and forms the foundation of the proposed joint
spatio-temporal precoding. The transferred dual eigenfuntions and coefficients
directly reconstruct the data symbols at the receiver upon demodulation,
thereby significantly reducing its computational burden, by alleviating the
need for any complementary post-coding. Additionally, the eigenfunctions
decomposed from the time-frequency delay-Doppler channel kernel are paramount
to extracting the second-order channel statistics, and therefore completely
characterize the underlying channel. We evaluate this using a realistic
non-stationary channel framework built in Matlab and show that our precoding
achieves ${\geqslant}$4 orders of reduction in BER at SNR${\geqslant}15$dB in
OFDM systems for higher-order modulations and less complexity compared to the
state-of-the-art precoding.

from unlabelled image pairs based on brightness constancy assumption and
smoothness prior. Current approaches additionally impose an augmentation
regularization term for continual self-supervision, which has been proved to be
effective on difficult matching regions. However, this method also amplify the
inevitable mismatch in unsupervised setting, blocking the learning process
towards optimal solution. To break the dilemma, we propose a novel mutual
distillation framework to transfer reliable knowledge back and forth between
the teacher and student networks for alternate improvement. Concretely, taking
estimation of off-the-shelf unsupervised approach as pseudo labels, our insight
locates at defining a confidence selection mechanism to extract relative good
matches, and then add diverse data augmentation for distilling adequate and
reliable knowledge from teacher to student. Thanks to the decouple nature of
our method, we can choose a stronger student architecture for sufficient
learning. Finally, better student prediction is adopted to transfer knowledge
back to the efficient teacher without additional costs in real deployment.
Rather than formulating it as a supervised task, we find that introducing an
extra unsupervised term for multi-target learning achieves best final results.
Extensive experiments show that our approach, termed MDFlow, achieves
state-of-the-art real-time accuracy and generalization ability on challenging

disordered proteins (IDPs). These peculiar proteins, whose tertiary structure
constantly interconverts between a series of energetically favourable
conformations, are the root of many current, pressing scientific mechanisms.
Many biological processes that are still yet to be elucidated--the mechanisms
of of protein folding, ligand binding, and general protein dynamics--involve
IDPs. Because most dynamic protein events are on such short time scales, using
experimental methods to observe their action often times doesn't yield useful
data. As well, the data resulting from scientific techniques developed for
structured, ""static proteins"" must be presented in conjunction with data from
methods tailored specifically to IDPs in order to have significance. A method
that models IDPs with shocking accuracy is computer simulation, particularly
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. With computational power only recently
increasing enough to encompass the timescale needed for protein dynamics, MD
simulations are still fairly novel in their implementations. This paper will
discuss and consolidate the current methods, problems, and solutions of using
MD simulation to model IDPs. Which simulation parameters can be altered to more
precisely describe observed biological behaviour? How can one accurately use MD
simulation to answer questions that, when using experimental methods, have no
answer? How can the data resulting from MD simulation be analyzed and
quantified to support the conclusions being drawn?

representations of generative factors can interfere and lead to ambiguity when
complex data with multiple objects are presented. In this paper, we propose a
brain-inspired hybrid neural network (HNN) that introduces temporal binding
theory originated from neuroscience into ANNs by integrating spike timing
dynamics (via spiking neural networks, SNNs) with reconstructive attention (by
ANNs). Spike timing provides an additional dimension for grouping, while
reconstructive feedback coordinates the spikes into temporal coherent states.
Through iterative interaction of ANN and SNN, the model continuously binds
multiple objects at alternative synchronous firing times in the SNN coding
space. The effectiveness of the model is evaluated on synthetic datasets of
binary images. By visualization and analysis, we demonstrate that the binding
is explainable, soft, flexible, and hierarchical. Notably, the model is trained

successfully binds multiple objects on test datasets, showing its compositional

optimization problems are NP-hard, finding optimal policies is intractable for
large graphs. We provide approximation guarantees on both curing and fair
curing policies. Moreover, when the total infection rate is large, the original
curing policy includes a waiting period in which no measures are taken to
mitigate the spread until the rate slows down. To avoid the waiting period, we
study network design problems to reduce the total infection rate by deleting
edges or reducing the weight of edges. Then the curing processes become
continuous since the total infection rate is restricted by network design. We
provide algorithms with provable guarantees for the considered network design

ECL that exploit 3D-printed structures such as intra-cavity photonic wire bonds
and facet-attached microlenses for low-loss optical coupling with relaxed
alignment tolerances, thereby overcoming the need for active alignment while
maintaining the full flexibility of multi-chip integration techniques. In a

extended stopping time which captures the phase transition between equivalence

before their separating time and singular afterwards. In this paper, we
investigate the separating time for two laws of general one-dimensional regular
continuous strong Markov processes, so-called general diffusions, which are
parameterized via scale functions and speed measures. Our main result is a
representation of the corresponding separating time as (loosely speaking) a
hitting time of a deterministic set which is characterized via speed and scale.
As hitting times are fairly easy to understand, our result gives access to
explicit and easy-to-check sufficient and necessary conditions for two laws of

discussed in a variety of examples. As an application of our main theorem, we

has attracted considerable attention in recent years, especially with the
development of deep learning techniques. Health risk refers to the probability
of the occurrence of a specific health outcome for a specific patient. The
predicted risks can be used to support decision-making by healthcare
professionals. EHRs are structured patient journey data. Each patient journey
contains a chronological set of clinical events, and within each clinical
event, there is a set of clinical/medical activities. Due to variations of
patient conditions and treatment needs, EHR patient journey data has an
inherently high degree of missingness that contains important information
affecting relationships among variables, including time. Existing deep
learning-based models generate imputed values for missing values when learning
the relationships. However, imputed data in EHR patient journey data may
distort the clinical meaning of the original EHR patient journey data,
resulting in classification bias. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end
approach to modeling EHR patient journey data with Integrated Convolutional and
Recurrent Neural Networks. Our model can capture both long- and short-term
temporal patterns within each patient journey and effectively handle the high
degree of missingness in EHR data without any imputation data generation.
Extensive experimental results using the proposed model on two real-world
datasets demonstrate robust performance as well as superior prediction accuracy

incoming order in some extent. Equilibria under various specific situations are
discussed. We conclude that HFT always front-runs and the large trader could be
favored in the following circumstances: (1) there is sufficient noise trading
with HFT's liquidity-consuming trading; (2) the noise trading with HFT's
liquidity-consuming trading is inadequate but HFT's signal is vague enough.
Besides, we explore the influences of market noise and signal noise on
investors' behavior and profits. We find surprisingly that (1) increasing the
noise in HFT's signal might decrease the large trader's profit; (2) when there
are few market noises, although HFT nearly does nothing, the large trader is
still hurt; (3) in any case, HFT will not front-run more than half of the large
trader's order.

Solar System are huge eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called
coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which usually drive shocks that accelerate
charged particles up to relativistic energies. In particular, energetic
electron beams can generate radio bursts through the plasma emission mechanism.
The main types of bursts associated with CME shocks are type II and herringbone
bursts. However, it is currently unknown where early accelerated electrons that
produce metric type II bursts and herringbones propagate and when they escape
the solar atmosphere. Aims. Here, we investigate the acceleration location,
escape, and propagation directions of electron beams during the early evolution
of a strongly expanding CME-driven shock wave associated with herrinbgone
bursts. Methods. We used ground-based radio observations from the Nan\c{c}ay
Radioheliograph combined with space-based extreme-ultraviolet and white-light
observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and and the Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory. We produced a three-dimensional (3D) representation of
the electron acceleration locations which, combined with results from
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models of the solar corona, was used to investigate
the origin of the herringbone bursts observed. Results. Multiple herringbone
bursts are found close to the CME flank in plane-of-sky images. Some of these
herringbone bursts have unusual inverted J shapes and opposite drifting
herringbones also show opposite senses of circular polarisation. By using a 3D
approach combined with the radio properties of the observed bursts, we find
evidence that the first radio emission in the CME eruption most likely
originates from electrons that initially propagate in regions of low Alfv\'en
speeds and along closed magnetic field lines forming a coronal streamer.

  Hardware Defense",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As cache-based side-channel attacks become serious security problems, various
defenses have been proposed and deployed in both software and hardware.
Consequently, cache-based side-channel attacks on processes co-residing on the
same core are becoming extremely difficult. Most of recent attacks then shift
their focus to the last-level cache (LLC). Although cache partitioning is
currently the most promising defense against the attacks abusing LLC, it is
ineffective in thwarting the side-channel attacks that automatically create
eviction sets or bypass the user address space layout randomization. In fact,
these attacks are largely undefended in current computer systems.
  We propose Remapped Cache Layout (\textsf{RCL}) -- a pure hardware defense
against a broad range of conflict-based side-channel attacks. \textsf{RCL}
obfuscates the mapping from address to cache sets; therefore, an attacker
cannot accurately infer the location of her data in caches or using a cache set
to infer her victim's data. To our best knowledge, it is the first defense to
thwart the aforementioned largely undefended side-channel attacks .
\textsf{RCL} has been implemented in a superscalar processor and detailed
evaluation results show that \textsf{RCL} incurs only small costs in area,
frequency and execution time.

M6.5 class flare (SOL2015-06-22T18:23) occurring in NOAA AR 12371 on 2015 June
22. Two flare precursors are observed before the flare main phase. Observations
in 94 {\AA} and 131 {\AA} by SDO/AIA have revealed the early morphology of the
first hot channel as a group of hot loops, which is termed as seed hot channel.
A few seed hot channels are formed above the polarity inversion line (PIL) and
the formation is associated with footpoint brightenings' parallel motion along
the PIL, which proceeds into the early stage of the flare main phase. During
this process, seed hot channels build up and rise slowly, being accelerated at
the peak of the second precursor. They merge in the process of acceleration
forming a larger hot channel, which then forms an ""inverted {\gamma}"" shape
kinking structure. Before the flare peak, the second kinking hot channel with
negative crossing appears near the first kinking hot channel that has erupted.
The eruption of these two hot channels produce two peaks on the main flare's
GOES light curve. The footpoint brightenings' propagation along the PIL
indicate that the first kinking hot channel may be formed due to zipper
reconnection. The occurrence of merging between seed hot channels observed by
AIA is supported by the extrapolated nonlinear force-free field models. The
observed writhing motion of the first kinking hot channel may be driven by the
Lorentz force.

a result, robust out-of-phase vibrations are found as a typical intrinsic mode
of DBMs. The same bound states are produced numerically in the framework of a

any given set of linear constraints with integer coefficients. Our algorithm
consists of two phases: first construct a decision diagram $(V,E)$ that somehow
represents a given $m \times n$ constraint matrix, and then build an equivalent
set of $|E|$ linear constraints over $n+|V|$ variables. That is, the size of
the resultant extended formulation depends not explicitly on the number $m$ of
the original constraints, but on its decision diagram representation.
Therefore, we may significantly reduce the computation time for optimization
problems with integer constraint matrices by solving them under the extended
formulations, especially when we obtain concise decision diagram
representations for the matrices. We can apply our method to $1$-norm
regularized hard margin optimization over the binary instance space
$\{0,1\}^n$, which can be formulated as a linear programming problem with $m$
constraints with $\{-1,0,1\}$-valued coefficients over $n$ variables, where $m$
is the size of the given sample. Furthermore, introducing slack variables over
the edges of the decision diagram, we establish a variant formulation of soft
margin optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our extended

optimization tasks over synthetic and real datasets.

collection of all infinite walks on a digraph with at most a single edge from a

constraint which determines the language of the shift entirely. In this paper,
in order to describe infinite walks on a multigraph, we introduce the notion of
multiplicity of a word (finite walk) and define repeated words as those having
multiplicity at least $2$. In general, for given collections $\F$ of forbidden
words and $\R$ of repeated words with pre-assigned multiplicities, we define
notion of a generalized language which is a multiset. We obtain a subshift
associated with $\F$ and $\R$ such that its entropy is calculated using the
generalized language. We also study the relationship between the language of
this subshift and the generalized language. We then obtain a combinatorial
expression for the generating function that enumerates the number of words of
fixed length in this generalized language. This gives the Perron root and
eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix with integer entries associated to the

definition of Parry measure for the associated edge shift are obtained. We also

from the Hermite polynomial expansion of the activation function, whose degree
only depends on the orthogonality among different data points. This polynomial
kernel determines the asymptotic behavior of the RFRR and the KRR. Our results
hold for a wide variety of activation functions and input data sets that
exhibit nearly orthogonal properties. Based on these approximations, we obtain
a lower bound for the generalization error of the RFRR for a nonlinear

electro-magnetic pulse by compressing magnetic flux with the help of explosion.
The physical properties of components and materials used for FCG manufacturing

differ from those originally used for FCG design. As a result, the output
parameters of the manufactured generator (e.g. maximum output power) could
deviate from the pre-calculated values. Simple formulas are derived to enable
evaluation of change in output power delivered to a purely inductive load from
a helical flux compression generator in case when the wire insulation thickness

The obtained formulas establish acceptable tolerances for FCG components

ensure minimal dependence of the output power delivered to the purely inductive

diversity of cooperative tasks in a shared environment? In the single-agent
paradigm, goal-conditioned policies have been combined with intrinsic
motivation mechanisms to endow agents with the ability to master a wide
diversity of autonomously discovered goals. Transferring this idea to
cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) entails a challenge: intrinsically
motivated agents that sample goals independently focus on a shared cooperative
goal with low probability, impairing their learning performance. In this work,
we propose a new learning paradigm for modeling such settings, the
Decentralized Intrinsically Motivated Skill Acquisition Problem (Dec-IMSAP),
and employ it to solve cooperative navigation tasks. Agents in a Dec-IMSAP are
trained in a fully decentralized way, which comes in contrast to previous
contributions in multi-goal MAS that consider a centralized goal-selection
mechanism. Our empirical analysis indicates that a sufficient condition for
efficiently learning a diversity of cooperative tasks is to ensure that a group
aligns its goals, i.e., the agents pursue the same cooperative goal and learn
to coordinate their actions through specialization. We introduce the
Goal-coordination game, a fully-decentralized emergent communication algorithm,
where goal alignment emerges from the maximization of individual rewards in
multi-goal cooperative environments and show that it is able to reach equal
performance to a centralized training baseline that guarantees aligned goals.
To our knowledge, this is the first contribution addressing the problem of
intrinsically motivated multi-agent goal exploration in a decentralized

transformer has made great progress, its long-range modeling capabilities are

To address this problem, we propose a novel Token Transformer (TT). The core
mechanism of TT is the addition of a Class (CLS) token for summarizing window
information in each local window. We refer to this type of token interaction as
CLS Attention. These CLS tokens will interact spatially with the tokens in each
window to enable long-range modeling. In order to preserve the hierarchical
design of the window-based transformer, we designed Feature Inheritance Module
(FIM) in each phase of TT to deliver the local window information from the
previous phase to the CLS token in the next phase. In addition, we have
designed a Spatial-Channel Feedforward Network (SCFFN) in TT, which can mix CLS
tokens and embedded tokens on the spatial domain and channel domain without
additional parameters. Extensive experiments have shown that our TT achieves
competitive results with low parameters in image classification and downstream

in our Galactic halo. We compiled our selection mainly on the basis of Gaia
data and determined the stellar atmospheres of our sample and the chemical
abundances of each star. In this paper, we present the first sample of 59

Galactic orbits for all stars. We found that 8 stars belong to the thin disc,
15 to disrupted satellites, and the remaining cannot be associated to the

provide abundances for the elements up to zinc. We also show the chemical
evolution results for eleven chemical elements, based on recent models. Our
observational strategy of using multiple telescopes and spectrographs to
acquire high S/N and high-resolution spectra has proven to be very efficient

dimension for subspaces $S$ of a Euclidean simplex, which is usually taken as
the smallest dimension of the skeleta containing~$S$. Later, P. Gajer employed
another dimension based on the dimension of polyhedra containing $S$. This last
one allows traces of pullbacks of singular strata in the interior of the domain

  In this work, we prove that the two corresponding intersection homologies are
isomorphic for Siebenmann's CS sets. In terms of King's paper, this means that
polyhedral dimension is a ``reasonable'' dimension. The proof uses a
Mayer-Vietoris argument which needs an adaptated subdivision. With the
polyhedral dimension, that is a subtle issue. General position arguments are
not sufficient and we introduce strong general position. With it, a stability
is added to the generic character and we can do an inductive cutting of each

Network (ICANet). It contains three modules that can effectively perform the
cross-modal and cross-scale fusions. We design a Hybrid Feature Fusion (HFF)
module to integrate the features of two modalities, which utilizes two types of
feature extraction. The Multi-Scale Attention Reinforcement (MSAR) and Upper
Fusion (UF) blocks are responsible for the cross-scale fusion that converges
different levels of features and generate the prediction maps. We also raise a
novel Context-Aware Multi-Supervised Network (CAMSNet) to calculate the content
loss between the prediction and the ground truth (GT). Experiments prove that
our network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art RGB-T SOD methods.

enriched materials into their surrounding interstellar medium and, in some
instances, into molecular clouds (MCs). The interaction of a supernova remnant
(SNR) with a MC plays a crucial role in the evolution of the cloud's physical
and chemical properties. Despite their importance, only a handful of studies
have been made addressing the molecular richness in MCs impacted by SNRs.
(Sub)millimter wavelength observations of SNR-MC can be used to build a census
of their molecular richness, which in turn can motivate various chemical and
physical models aimed at explaining the chemical evolution of the clouds.
  Aims: We carried out multi-molecule/multi-transition observations toward the
region F abutting the SNR W28. We used the detected lines to constrain the
physical conditions of this region.
  Methods: We used the APEX Telescope to observe molecular lines in the
frequency from $213\rm{-}374\, \textrm{GHz}$. We used non-LTE RADEX modeling to
interpret the observational data.
  Results: We detected emission from multiple molecular species, namely
CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$CO, SO, SiO, CN, CCH, NO, CS, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$,
CO, and from isotopologues of some of them. We report the first detection of
thermally excited (non-maser) CH$_{3}$OH emission toward a SNR. Employing
non-LTE RADEX modeling of multiple H$_{2}$CO and CH$_{3}$OH lines, we constrain
the kinetic temperature from 60 to 100$\,$K and the gas density from $9\times
10^{5}$ to $5\times 10^{6}\,\rm cm^{-3}$. We obtained an ortho-para ratio
$\sim$2 for H$_{2}$CO, which indicates that formaldehyde is most likely formed
on dust grain surfaces.
  Conclusions: Our results show that molecules as complex as H$_{2}$CO and
CH$_{3}$OH can be detected in SNR-MC interactions. This could motivate chemical

is composed of re-entrant truss-lattice elements. It is shown that this system
can deform very differently and can exhibit a versatile extent of the auxetic
behaviour depending on a small change in the thickness of its hinges. In
addition, depending on which hierarchical level is deforming, the whole
structure can exhibit a different type of auxetic behaviour that corresponds to
a unique deformation mechanism. This results in a dual auxetic structure where
the interplay between the two auxetic mechanisms determines the evolution of
the system. It is also shown that depending on the specific deformation
pattern, it is possible to observe a very different behaviour of the structure
in terms of frequencies of waves that can be transmitted through the system. In
fact, it is demonstrated that even a very small change in the parametric design
of the system may result in a significantly different band gap formation that
can be useful in the design of tunable vibration dampers or sensors. The
possibility of controlling the extent of the auxeticity also makes the proposed
metamaterial to be very appealing from the point of view of protective and

pursued for decades. However, their magnetoelectric performances remain limited

family of nitride perovskites is proposed as multiferroics with prominent
physical properties and nontrivial mechanisms. Taking GdWN$_3$ as a prototype,
our first-principles calculations found that its perovskite phases own large
polarizations (e.g. $111.3$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$ for the $R3c$ phase) and a magnetic

origin is multiple, with significant contributions from both Gd$^{3+}$ and
W$^{6+}$ ions, different from its sister member LaWN$_3$ in which the
ferroelectricity almost arises from W$^{6+}$ ions only. With decreasing size of
rare earth ions, the A site ions would contribute more and more to the
ferroelectric instability. Considering that small rare earth ions can be
primary origins of both proper ferroelectricity and magnetism in nitride
perovskites, our work provides a route to pursuit more multiferroics with
unconventional mechanisms and optimal performances.

United States, resulting in non-trivial challenges for researchers and
educators when working with these data. In pathology, the digitization of
diagnostic tissue samples inevitably generates identifying data that can
consist of sensitive but also acquisition-related information stored in
vendor-specific file formats. Distribution and off-clinical use of these Whole
Slide Images (WSI) is usually done in these formats, as an industry-wide
standardization such as DICOM is yet only tentatively adopted and slide scanner
vendors currently do not provide anonymization functionality.
  Methods: We developed a guideline for the proper handling of
histopathological image data particularly for research and education with
regard to the GDPR. In this context, we evaluated existing anonymization
methods and examined proprietary format specifications to identify all
sensitive information for the most common WSI formats. This work results in a
software library that enables GDPR-compliant anonymization of WSIs while
preserving the native formats.
  Results: Based on the analysis of proprietary formats, all occurrences of
sensitive information were identified for file formats frequently used in
clinical routine, and finally, an open-source programming library with an
executable CLI-tool and wrappers for different programming languages was
developed.
  Conclusions: Our analysis showed that there is no straightforward software
solution to anonymize WSIs in a GDPR-compliant way while maintaining the data

to bring unintended consequences. One such consequence is the pronounced effect
of AI-related unfairness and attendant fairness-related harms. These
fairness-related harms could involve differential treatment of individuals; for
example, unfairly denying a loan to certain individuals or groups of
individuals. In this paper, we focus on identifying and mitigating individual
unfairness and leveraging some of the recently published techniques in this
domain, especially as applicable to the credit adjudication use case. We also
investigate the extent to which techniques for achieving individual fairness
are effective at achieving group fairness. Our main contribution in this work
is functionalizing a two-step training process which involves learning a fair
similarity metric from a group sense using a small portion of the raw data and
training an individually ""fair"" classifier using the rest of the data where the
sensitive features are excluded. The key characteristic of this two-step
technique is related to its flexibility, i.e., the fair metric obtained in the
first step can be used with any other individual fairness algorithms in the
second step. Furthermore, we developed a second metric (distinct from the fair
similarity metric) to determine how fairly a model is treating similar
individuals. We use this metric to compare a ""fair"" model against its baseline
model in terms of their individual fairness value. Finally, some experimental
results corresponding to the individual unfairness mitigation techniques are
presented.

state-of-the-art works reveal that fusion of radar and LiDAR can lead to robust
detection in adverse weather. The existing works adopt convolutional neural
network architecture to extract features from each sensor data stream, then
align and aggregate the two branch features to predict object detection
results. However, these methods have low accuracy of bounding box estimations
due to a simple design of label assignment and fusion strategies. In this
paper, we propose a bird's-eye view fusion learning-based anchor box-free

range-azimuth heatmap and the LiDAR point cloud to estimate the possible
objects. Different label assignment strategies have been designed to facilitate
the consistency between the classification of foreground or background anchor
points and the corresponding bounding box regressions. In addition, the
performance of the proposed object detector is further enhanced by employing a
novel interactive transformer module. The superior performance of the proposed

contributions: Firstly, we add a wide range of data reductions that are
partially inspired by reductions for the similar vertex cover problem. For
this, we give a theoretical basis for lifting reductions from vertex cover to
DFVSP but also incorporate novel ideas into strictly more general and new DFVSP
reductions.
  Secondly, we propose dynamically encoding DFVSP in propositional logic using
cycle propagation for improved performance. Cycle propagation builds on the
idea that already a limited number of the constraints in a propositional
encoding is usually sufficient for finding an optimal solution. Our algorithm,
therefore, starts with a small number of constraints and cycle propagation adds
additional constraints when necessary. We propose an efficient integration of
cycle propagation into the workflow of MaxSAT solvers, further improving the
performance of our algorithm.

hate speech. Donald Trump's ''Chinese Virus'' tweet shifted the blame for the
spread of the Covid-19 virus to China and the Chinese people, which triggered a
new round of anti-China hate both online and offline. This research intends to
examine China-related hate speech on Twitter during the two years following the
burst of the pandemic (2020 and 2021). Through Twitter's API, in total
2,172,333 tweets hashtagged #china posted during the time were collected. By
employing multiple state-of-the-art pretrained language models for hate speech
detection, we identify a wide range of hate of various types, resulting in an
automatically labeled anti-China hate speech dataset. We identify a hateful
rate in #china tweets of 2.5% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021. This is well above the
average rate of online hate speech on Twitter at 0.6% identified in Gao et al.,
2017. We further analyzed the longitudinal development of #china tweets and
those identified as hateful in 2020 and 2021 through visualizing the daily
number and hate rate over the two years. Our keyword analysis of hate speech in
#china tweets reveals the most frequently mentioned terms in the hateful #china
tweets, which can be used for further social science studies.

environment in wireless networks by tuning multiple reflecting elements. RISs
have been traditionally realized through single connected architectures,
mathematically characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix. Recently, beyond
diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as a novel branch of RISs whose
scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal, which creates new benefits and
opportunities for RISs. Efficient BD-RIS architectures have been realized based
on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks. However, a
closed-form solution for the global optimal scattering matrix of these
architectures is not yet available. In this paper, we provide such a
closed-form solution proving that the theoretical performance upper bounds can
be exactly achieved for any channel realization. We first consider the received
signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO)
systems aided by a BD-RIS working in reflective or transmissive mode. Then, we
extend our solution to single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
multi-user MIMO systems. We show that our algorithm is less complex than the
iterative optimization algorithms employed in the previous literature. The
complexity of our algorithm grows linearly (resp. cubically) with the number of
RIS elements in the case of group (resp. fully) connected architectures.

attracted a lot of interest recently. Many image synthesis works utilize class

explicit temporal guidance, such as when an action starts or ends. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce semantic video scene graphs as input for video
synthesis, as they represent the spatial and temporal relationships between
objects in the scene. Since video scene graphs are usually temporally discrete
annotations, we propose a video scene graph (VSG) encoder that not only encodes
the existing video scene graphs but also predicts the graph representations for
unlabeled frames. The VSG encoder is pre-trained with different contrastive
multi-modal losses. A semantic scene graph-to-video synthesis framework
(SSGVS), based on the pre-trained VSG encoder, VQ-VAE, and auto-regressive
Transformer, is proposed to synthesize a video given an initial scene image and
a non-fixed number of semantic scene graphs. We evaluate SSGVS and other

considering the benefits of a brain-computer interface (BCI) to enable
intuitive commutation, this study proposes a novel method to predict human
hazard response choices and decision confidence from brain activities for a
superior confidence-weighted voting strategy. Methodology: First, we developed
a Bayesian inference-based algorithm to ascertain the decision threshold above
which a hazard is reported from human brain signals. This method was tested
empirically with electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected in a laboratory
setting and cross-validated using behavioral indices of the signal detection
theory. Subsequently, based on numerical simulations, the decision criteria for
low-, medium-, and high-confidence level differentiations characterized by
parietal alpha-band EEG power were determined. Findings : The investigated
hazard recognition task was described as a process of probabilistic inference
involving a decision uncertainty evaluation. The results demonstrated the
feasibility of EEG measurements in observing human internal representations of
hazard discrimination. Moreover, the optimal criteria to differentiate between
low-, medium-, and high-confidence levels were obtained by benchmarking against
an optimal Bayesian observer. Originality: This research demonstrates the
potential of a BCI as an effective channel for telecommunication, laying the
foundation for the design of future hazard detection techniques in the

Many cities have their new shared e-mobility systems deployed, with
continuously expanding coverage from central areas to the city edges. A key
challenge in the operation of these systems is fleet rebalancing, i.e., how EVs
should be repositioned to better satisfy future demand. This is particularly
challenging in the context of expanding systems, because i) the range of the
EVs is limited while charging time is typically long, which constrain the
viable rebalancing operations; and ii) the EV stations in the system are
dynamically changing, i.e., the legitimate targets for rebalancing operations
can vary over time. We tackle these challenges by first investigating rich sets
of data collected from a real-world shared e-mobility system for one year,
analyzing the operation model, usage patterns and expansion dynamics of this
new mobility mode. With the learned knowledge we design a high-fidelity
simulator, which is able to abstract key operation details of EV sharing at
fine granularity. Then we model the rebalancing task for shared e-mobility
systems under continuous expansion as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) problem, which directly takes the range and charging properties of the
EVs into account. We further propose a novel policy optimization approach with
action cascading, which is able to cope with the expansion dynamics and solve
the formulated MARL. We evaluate the proposed approach extensively, and
experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art,
offering significant performance gain in both satisfied demand and net revenue.

real world do not result in unfairness or unintended social consequences. Fair
ML has largely focused on the protection of single attributes in the simpler
setting where both attributes and target outcomes are binary. However, the
practical application in many a real-world problem entails the simultaneous
protection of multiple sensitive attributes, which are often not simply binary,
but continuous or categorical. To address this more challenging task, we
introduce FairCOCCO, a fairness measure built on cross-covariance operators on
reproducing kernel Hilbert Spaces. This leads to two practical tools: first,
the FairCOCCO Score, a normalised metric that can quantify fairness in settings
with single or multiple sensitive attributes of arbitrary type; and second, a
subsequent regularisation term that can be incorporated into arbitrary learning
objectives to obtain fair predictors. These contributions address crucial gaps
in the algorithmic fairness literature, and we empirically demonstrate
consistent improvements against state-of-the-art techniques in balancing
predictive power and fairness on real-world datasets.

  Universty of Oxford",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian inference has theoretical attractions as a principled framework for
reasoning about beliefs. However, the motivations of Bayesian inference which
claim it to be the only 'rational' kind of reasoning do not apply in practice.
They create a binary split in which all approximate inference is equally
'irrational'. Instead, we should ask ourselves how to define a spectrum of
more- and less-rational reasoning that explains why we might prefer one
Bayesian approximation to another. I explore approximate inference in Bayesian
neural networks and consider the unintended interactions between the
probabilistic model, approximating distribution, optimization algorithm, and
dataset. The complexity of these interactions highlights the difficulty of any
strategy for evaluating Bayesian approximations which focuses entirely on the
method, outside the context of specific datasets and decision-problems. For
given applications, the expected utility of the approximate posterior can
measure inference quality. To assess a model's ability to incorporate different
parts of the Bayesian framework we can identify desirable characteristic
behaviours of Bayesian reasoning and pick decision-problems that make heavy use
of those behaviours. Here, we use continual learning (testing the ability to
update sequentially) and active learning (testing the ability to represent
credence). But existing continual and active learning set-ups pose challenges
that have nothing to do with posterior quality which can distort their ability
to evaluate Bayesian approximations. These unrelated challenges can be removed
or reduced, allowing better evaluation of approximate inference methods.

stellar flares and associated Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) assumed that the
planet's interior remains unaffected by interplanetary CMEs, only considering
the effect of plasma/UV interactions on the atmosphere of planets. Here, we
show that the magnetic flux carried by flare-associated CMEs results in
planetary interior heating by Ohmic dissipation and leads to a variety of
interior--exterior interactions. We construct a physical model to study this
effect and apply it to the TRAPPIST-1 star whose flaring activity has been
constrained by Kepler observations. Our model is posed in a stochastic manner
to account for uncertainty and variability in input parameters. Particularly
for the innermost planets, our results suggest that the heat dissipated in the
silicate mantle is both of sufficient magnitude and longevity to drive
geological processes and hence facilitate volcanism and outgassing of the
TRAPPIST-1 planets. Furthermore, our model predicts that Joule heating can
further be enhanced for planets with an intrinsic magnetic field compared to
those without. The associated volcanism and outgassing may continuously
replenish the atmosphere and thereby mitigate the erosion of the atmosphere
caused by the direct impact of flares and CMEs. To maintain consistency of
atmospheric and geophysical models, the impact of stellar flares and CMEs on
atmospheres of close-in exoplanetary systems needs to be studied in conjunction
with the effect on planetary interiors.

theoretically. The activation barrier for the dissociation of H2 on Cu(001) is
determined by first-principles calculations to be ~ 0.59 eV in height. Electron
transfer from the substrate Cu to H2 plays a key role in the activation,
breaking of the H-H bond and the formation of the Cu-H bonds. At around the
critical height of bond breaking, two stationary states are identified, which
correspond respectively to the molecular and dissociative state. Using the
transfer matrix method, we are able to study the role of quantum tunneling in
the dissociation process along the minimum energy pathway (MEP), which is found
to be significant at room temperature and below. At given temperatures, the
tunneling contributions from the translational and vibrational motions of H2
are quantified for the dissociation process. Within a wide range of
temperatures, the effects of quantum tunneling on the effective barriers of
dissociation and the rate constants are revealed. The deduced energetic
parameters associated with thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium (molecular
beam) conditions are comparable with experimental data. In the low-temperature
region, crossover from classical to quantum regime is identified.

optical setups are beginning to emerge as useful tools to modify and manipulate
matter with nanoscale spatial resolution. We try to contribute to these efforts
by reporting a method that we found viable to modify the surface refractive
index of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), an acrylic polymer material. The
changes in the refractive index are accomplished by focusing a femtosecond
pulsed near-infrared laser beam on the apex of a metalized nano-sized tip,
traditionally used in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) applications. The adopted
illumination strategy yields circular-shaped modifications of the refractive
index occurring at the surface of the PMMA sample, exhibiting a lateral size
<200 nm, under 790 nm illumination, representing a four-fold increase in
precision compared to the current state-of-the-art. The light intensity
enhancement effects taking place at the tip apex makes possible achieving
refractive index changes at low laser pulse energies (<0.5 nJ), which
represents two orders of magnitude advantage over the current state-of-the art.
The presented nanoimprinting method is very flexible, as it can be used with
different power levels and can potentially be operated with other materials.
Besides enabling modifications of the refractive index with high lateral
resolution, this method can pave the way towards other important applications

However, few works explored the feasibility of using BOLD signals directly as

ignores the implicit topological organization of the brain. In this paper, we
propose a spatial temporal graph convolutional network with a novel graph

temporal graph convolution block directly exploits BOLD time series as input
features, which provides an interesting view for rsfMRI-based preclinical AD

$f^{\rm rel}_{\rm esc} = 0.021^{+0.101}_{-0.006}$, both detected at the

practical bosonic codes that have rotation symmetries, such as cat codes and
binomial codes. While cat codes achieve the break-even point in which the
coherence time of the encoded qubits exceeds that of unencoded qubits, with
binomial codes nearly approaching that point, the state preparation fidelity
needs to be still improved for practical quantum computing. Concerning this
problem, we investigate the framework of symmetry expansion, a class of quantum
error mitigation that virtually projects the state onto the noise-free
symmetric subspace by exploiting the system's intrinsic symmetries and
post-processing of measurement outcomes. Although symmetry expansion has been
limited to error mitigation of quantum states immediately before measurement,
we successfully generalize symmetry expansion for state preparation. To
implement our method, we use an ancilla qubit and only two controlled-rotation
gates via dispersive interactions between the bosonic code states and the
ancilla qubit. Interestingly, this method also allows us to virtually prepare
the RSBC states only from easy-to-prepare states, e.g., coherent states. We
also discuss that the conventional symmetry expansion protocol can be applied
to improve the computation fidelity when the symmetries of rotation bosonic
codes are unavailable due to low measurement fidelity. By giving comprehensive
analytical and numerical arguments regarding the trace distance between the
error-mitigated state and the ideal state and the sampling cost of quantum
error mitigation, we show that symmetry expansion dramatically suppresses the
effect of photon loss. Our novel error mitigation method will significantly
enhance computation accuracy in the near-term bosonic quantum computing

and information processing tasks. In a lackadaisical walk, in addition to the
possibility of moving out of a node, the walker can remain on the same node
with some probability. This is achieved by introducing self-loops,
parameterized by self-loop strength $l$, attached to the nodes such that large
$l$ implies a higher likelihood for the walker to be trapped at the node. This
model was shown to improve the performance of algorithms for search on a
two-dimensional grid. In this work, $\textit{directed}$, lackadaisical quantum
walks is studied. Depending on $l$, two regimes are shown to exist -- one in
which classical walker dominates and another in which quantum advantage is
realized. Further, the latter regime shows two distinct scaling regimes with
$l$. The quantum advantage can be tuned by varying the initial state and $l$.
Surprisingly, a significant quantum-induced speedup is realized for large $l$.
By tuning the initial state, the extent of quantum advantage can be modified --
from mild to exponential. This is explicitly demonstrated on two discrete
topologies: a line and a binary tree.

thanks to the discovery of gain media that were operable at room-temperature,
eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use. However, besides the two
known materials of pentacene doped in para-terphenyl and negatively-charged
nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond, there has been scarce progress in the
search for completely new room-temperature gain media. Here we show the
discovery of 6,13-diazapentacene doped in para-terphenyl as a maser gain medium
that can operate at room-temperature and without an external magnetic field. A
measured maser pulse power of -10 dBm shows it is on par with pentacene-doped
para-terphenyl in absolute power, while possessing compelling advantages
against its pentacene predecessor in that it has a faster amplification startup
time, can be excited with longer wavelength light at 620 nm and enjoys greater
chemical stability from added nitrogen groups. Furthermore, we show that the
maser bursts allow 6,13-diazapentacene-doped para-terphenyl to reach the strong
coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics, where it has a high
cooperativity of 182. We study the optical and microwave spin dynamics of
6,13-diazapentacene-doped para-terphenyl in order to evaluate its behavior as a
maser gain medium, where it features fast intersystem crossing and an
advantageously higher triplet quantum yield. Our results pave the way for the
future discovery of other similar maser materials and help point to such
materials as promising candidates for the study of cavity quantum
electrodynamic effects at room-temperature.

cycles of materials from production to end of use, which enables environmental,
social and economic impacts and interventions. MFA is challenging as available
data is often limited and uncertain, giving rise to an underdetermined system
with an infinite number of solutions when attempting to calculate the values of
all stocks and flows in the system. Bayesian statistics is an effective way to
address these challenges as it rigorously quantifies uncertainty in the data
and propagates it in a system flow model to provide the probabilities
associated with model solutions. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach provides a
natural way to incorporate useful domain knowledge about the system through the
elicitation of the prior distribution.
  This paper presents a novel Bayesian approach to MFA. We propose a mass based
framework that directly models the flow and change in stock variables in the
system, including systems with simultaneous presence of stocks and
disaggregation of processes. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a global
aluminium cycle, under a scenario where there is a shortage of data, coupled
with weakly informative priors that only require basic information on flows and
change in stocks. Bayesian model checking helps to identify inconsistencies in
the data, and the posterior distribution is used to identify the variables in
the system with the most uncertainty, which can aid data collection. We
numerically investigate the properties of our method in simulations, and show
that in limited data settings, the elicitation of an informative prior can
greatly improve the performance of Bayesian methods, including for both
estimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

resonant chains. In contrast to previous studies, our results show that the
disk properties have the dominant impact on capture into mean motion resonance,
while the total planetary mass barely affects the final system configuration as
long as the planet does not open a gap in the disk. We confirm that the
adiabatic resonant capture is the correct framework to understand the
conditions leading to MMR formation, since its predictions are qualitatively
similar to the numerical results. However, we find that the eccentricity
damping can facilitate the capture in a given resonance. We find that under
typical disk conditions, planets tend to be captured into 2:1 or 3:2 MMRs,
which agrees well with the observed exoplanet MMRs. Our results predict two
categories of systems: those that have uniform chains of wide resonances (2:1

such as 4:3:2 chains. Both categories of resonant chains are present in
observed exoplanet systems. On the other hand, chains with a wider inner pair

about 2.81+-0.03, as expected from previous X-ray studies of NLS1s.
Interestingly, it is positively skewed, and about 10 percent of the sources are

are of further interest as their source counts run into the X-ray background at
values at around 1 keV. We argue that ionised outflows have been detected by
eROSITA and may account for some of the extreme spectral steepness, which is
supported by correlations found between the photon index and optical outflows
parameters. We analysed the intrinsic X-ray variability of the eRASS1 to eRASS3

3D space, well-designed 3D-to-2D projection and image refinement are required.
Our HOReeNet is the first fully differentiable framework proposed for such a

  Post-Editing","EMNLP 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art summarization models still struggle to be factually
consistent with the input text. A model-agnostic way to address this problem is
post-editing the generated summaries. However, existing approaches typically
fail to remove entity errors if a suitable input entity replacement is not
available or may insert erroneous content. In our work, we focus on removing
extrinsic entity errors, or entities not in the source, to improve consistency
while retaining the summary's essential information and form. We propose to use
sentence-compression data to train the post-editing model to take a summary
with extrinsic entity errors marked with special tokens and output a
compressed, well-formed summary with those errors removed. We show that this
model improves factual consistency while maintaining ROUGE, improving entity
precision by up to 30% on XSum, and that this model can be applied on top of
another post-editor, improving entity precision by up to a total of 38%. We
perform an extensive comparison of post-editing approaches that demonstrate
trade-offs between factual consistency, informativeness, and grammaticality,
and we analyze settings where post-editors show the largest improvements.

currently predominated methods are mainly based on deep generative models,
especially the generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing
GAN-based models usually suffer from the well-known mode collapse problem. When
mode collapse happens, the kind of GAN-based models will be failure to yield
the correct fonts. To address this issue, we introduce a one-bit stroke
encoding and a few-shot semi-supervised scheme (i.e., using a few paired data
as semi-supervised information) to explore the local and global structure
information of Chinese characters respectively, motivated by the intuition that
strokes and characters directly embody certain local and global modes of
Chinese characters. Based on these ideas, this paper proposes an effective
model called \textit{StrokeGAN+}, which incorporates the stroke encoding and
the few-shot semi-supervised scheme into the CycleGAN model. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is demonstrated by amounts of experiments. Experimental
results show that the mode collapse issue can be effectively alleviated by the
introduced one-bit stroke encoding and few-shot semi-supervised training
scheme, and that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in
fourteen font generation tasks in terms of four important evaluation metrics
and the quality of generated characters. Besides CycleGAN, we also show that
the proposed idea can be adapted to other existing models to improve their
performance. The effectiveness of the proposed model for the zero-shot
traditional Chinese font generation is also evaluated in this paper.

account for the flow, a decomposition of the fluid pressure and velocity in the
steady and fluctuating parts is employed. This enables for a linearization and
an efficient use of the homogenization method which leads to a model order

of selecting normative conceptions for specifying risks, aggregating and
quantifying risks including the use of metrics, balancing of value conflicts,
setting levels of acceptable risks, and standardisation. To avoid a lack of
democratic legitimacy and legal uncertainty, scientific and political debates
are suggested.

by adjusting the diffusion coefficient DL, the dissipation at the interface can
be altered. With different DL, different stages during directional

dendrite growth, and steady-state growth. From the viewpoint of dissipation,
the role of solute diffusion in evolution is given out. Even under the local

role in alloy solidification, altered by solute diffusion. Moreover, the
competitive influences of tip curvature and velocity are also because of the

there should be a pronounced country-size effect: Countries with a larger share

damages and thus set higher carbon prices. We use this theoretical prediction
for testing the free-rider hypothesis empirically. Drawing on data on
emission-weighted carbon prices from 2020, while controlling for a host of
other potential explanatory variables of carbon pricing, we find that the

Specifically, we train a single FL classification model (`global`) using two
separate CXR datasets -- one annotated for presence of pneumonia and the other
for presence of pneumothorax (two common and life-threatening conditions) --
capable of diagnosing both. We compare the performance of the global FL model
with models trained separately on both datasets (`baseline`) for two different

FL model achieved AUROC of 0.84 and 0.81 for pneumonia and pneumothorax,

reconstruction for nonlinear systems. The proposed method augments the system
dynamics with an approximated internal linear model of the combined

approximated linear model in the augmented state. We exploit the broad modeling
power of ultra-local models to characterize this internal dynamics. We use a
linear filter to reconstruct the augmented state (simultaneously estimating the
state of the original system and the sum of nonlinearities and faults). Having
this combined estimate, we can simply subtract the analytic expression of
nonlinearities from that of the corresponding estimate to reconstruct the fault
vector. Because the nonlinearity does not play a role in the filter dynamics
(it is only used as a static nonlinear output to estimate the fault), we can
avoid standard restrictive assumptions like globally (one-sided) Lipschitz
nonlinearities and/or the need for Lipschitz constants to carry out the filter
design. The filter synthesis is posed as a mixed H2/Hinf optimization problem
where the effect of disturbances and model mismatches is minimized in the Hinf
sense, for an acceptable H2 performance with respect to measurement noise.

to be trained individually on the semantic, instance, or panoptic segmentation

trained only once and achieve SOTA performance across all three image

segmentation framework that unifies segmentation with a multi-task train-once
design. We first propose a task-conditioned joint training strategy that
enables training on ground truths of each domain (semantic, instance, and
panoptic segmentation) within a single multi-task training process. Secondly,
we introduce a task token to condition our model on the task at hand, making
our model task-dynamic to support multi-task training and inference. Thirdly,
we propose using a query-text contrastive loss during training to establish
better inter-task and inter-class distinctions. Notably, our single OneFormer

the simplest balance controller that leads to robust walking for a linear
inverted pendulum (LIP) model. The main idea is to use a linear function of the
body velocity to determine the next foot placement, which we call linear foot
placement control (LFPC). By using the Poincar\'e map, a balance criterion is
derived, which shows that LFPC is stable when the velocity-feedback coefficient
is located in a certain range. And that range is much bigger when stepping
faster, which indicates ""faster stepping, easier to balance"". We show that
various gaits can be generated by adjusting the controller parameters in LFPC.
Particularly, a dead-beat controller is discovered that can lead to
steady-state walking in just one step. The effectiveness of LFPC is verified
through Matlab simulation as well as V-REP simulation for both 2D and 3D
walking. The main feature of LFPC is its simplicity and inherent robustness,
which may help us understand the essence of how to maintain balance in dynamic
walking.

consensus (DC) since many autonomous vehicles (AVs) reach a consensus to move
as one body with the same velocity and inter-distance. For DC control to be
stable, other AVs' real-time position information should be inputted to each
AV's controller via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. On the other hand,
too many V2V links should be simultaneously established and frequently
retrained, causing frequent packet loss and longer communication latency. We
propose a novel DC algorithm called over-the-air consensus (AirCons), a joint
communication-and-control design with two key features to overcome the above
limitations. First, exploiting a wireless signal's superposition and
broadcasting properties renders all AVs' signals to converge to a specific
value proportional to participating AVs' average position without individual
V2V channel information. Second, the estimated average position is used to
control each AV's dynamics instead of each AV's individual position. Through
analytic and numerical studies, the effectiveness of the proposed AirCons
designed on the state-of-the-art New Radio architecture is verified by showing
a $14.22\%$ control gain compared to the benchmark without the average

bonds, metal-coordination bonds, dynamic covalent bonds, and ionic bonds. The
combination of entanglements and ionic bonding has been minimally explored and
is particularly exciting because of the broad application space for
polyelectrolytes. In this work, a constitutive model framework is developed to
describe the response of elastomers with both ionic bonds and entanglements. We
formulate a micromechanical model that couples together chain stretching, ionic
bond slipping, and entanglement evolution. The ionic bonds provide toughness by
enabling plastic deformation in comparison to covalently crosslinked material
and add strength compared to a linear polymer. Evolution of the entanglement
density is taken as a key mechanism that can govern stiffness, toughness, and
self-recovery in elastomers. The model is used to match bulk polyelectrolytes
with different fractions of ionic components under a variety of loading
histories. The variations in material parameters are then used to help
understand the relative importance of different governing mechanisms in the
bulk polymers. We show that the theoretical framework can explain our
experimental uniaxial tensile experimental results for polyelectrolytes. This
model can help to design better material with high stiffness and toughness. We
expect that our model can be extended to explain the mechanical behavior of
other polyelectrolytes and other soft materials with a wide range of dynamic
bonds.

cross-modality image generation. Controllable person image generation promotes
a wide range of applications such as digital human interaction and virtual
try-on. However, previous methods mostly employ single-modality information as
the prior condition (e.g. pose-guided person image generation), or utilize the
preset words for text-driven human synthesis. Introducing a sentence composed
of free words with an editable semantic pose map to describe person appearance
is a more user-friendly way. In this paper, we propose HumanDiffusion, a
coarse-to-fine alignment diffusion framework, for text-driven person image
generation. Specifically, two collaborative modules are proposed, the Stylized
Memory Retrieval (SMR) module for fine-grained feature distillation in data
processing and the Multi-scale Cross-modality Alignment (MCA) module for
coarse-to-fine feature alignment in diffusion. These two modules guarantee the
alignment quality of the text and image, from image-level to feature-level,
from low-resolution to high-resolution. As a result, HumanDiffusion realizes
open-vocabulary person image generation with desired semantic poses. Extensive
experiments conducted on DeepFashion demonstrate the superiority of our method
compared with previous approaches. Moreover, better results could be obtained
for complicated person images with various details and uncommon poses.

P4O significantly outperforms a baseline recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm
on multiple Atari games using a single GPU. It also outperforms other
state-of-the-art agents given the same wall-clock time and exceeds human gamer
performance on multiple games including Seaquest, which is a particularly

regression, their accuracy remains unsatisfactory, particularly in cases where

multi-task deep learning framework that simultaneously estimates LMA amount and
classify the scar-free LMA regions based on cine displacement encoding with
stimulated echoes (DENSE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With a newly
introduced auxiliary LMA region classification sub-network, our proposed model
shows more robustness to the complex pattern cause by myocardial scar,
significantly eliminates their negative effects in LMA detection, and in turn
improves the performance of scar classification. To evaluate the effectiveness
of our method, we tests our model on real cardiac MR images and compare the
predicted LMA with the state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that our approach
achieves substantially increased accuracy. In addition, we employ the

by utilizing simultaneously learned myocardium segmentations to eliminate
negative effects from non-region-of-interest areas. In contrast to previous
approaches treating scar detection and myocardium segmentation as separate or

the information of myocardium segmentation is directly passed to guide scar
detectors. This newly designed network will efficiently exploit joint

effectiveness of JDL on LGE-CMR images for automated left ventricular (LV) scar

both ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease and to improve response rates to
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure patients.

language processing called coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is
about finding all entities in the text that refers to the same real-world
entity. This paper presents a hybrid model combining multiple rulebased sieves
with a machine-learning sieve for pronouns. For this purpose, seven
high-precision rule-based sieves are designed for the Persian language. Then, a
random forest classifier links pronouns to the previous partial clusters. The
presented method demonstrates exemplary performance using pipeline design and
combining the advantages of machine learning and rulebased methods. This method
has solved some challenges in end-to-end models. In this paper, the authors
develop a Persian coreference corpus called Mehr in the form of 400 documents.
This corpus fixes some weaknesses of the previous corpora in the Persian
language. Finally, the efficiency of the presented system compared to the
earlier model in Persian is reported by evaluating the proposed method on the
Mehr and Uppsala test sets.

we show that the X-ray photon index, Gamma, is correlated with the mass
accretion rate, Mdot. We find that Gamma increases monotonically with Mdot from
the LHS to the HSS, and then saturated at Gamma~3. This index behavior is
similar to that exhibited by a number of other BH candidates. This result
represents observational evidence of the presence of a BH in MAXI~J1348--630.
We also show that the value of Gamma is correlated with the QPO frequency,
\nu_{L}. Based on this correlation, we applied a scaling method to estimate a
BH mass of 14.8 +/- 0.9 M_{\odot}, using the BH binary XTE~J1550--564 as a
reference source. The recent discovery of a giant dust scattering ring around
MAXI~J1348--630 by SRG/eROSITA has refined distance estimates to this X-ray
source. With this distance, we were able to estimate the disk inclination i =
(65+/- 7)^0 using the scaling technique for the correlation between Gamma and
normalization proportional to Mdot. An initial decrease in kT_s occurred
simultaneously with an increase in the illumination fraction, f. At the start

well-developed nanowire ensembles between these two extremes is generally
lacking. Here, we examine the self-assembly of SiN$_x$ patches on TiN(111)
substrates which are eventually acting as seeds for the growth of GaN
nanowires. We first found that if prepared by reactive sputtering, the TiN
surface is characterized by \{100\} facets for which the GaN incubation time is
extremely long. Fast GaN nucleation is only obtained after deposition of a
sub-monolayer of SiN$_x$ atoms prior to the GaN growth. By varying the amount
of pre-deposited SiN$_x$, the GaN nanowire density could be tuned by three
orders of magnitude with excellent uniformity over the entire wafer, bridging
the density regimes conventionally attainable by direct self-assembly with MBE
or MOVPE. The analysis of the nanowire morphology agrees with a nucleation of
the GaN nanowires on nanometric SiN$_x$ patches. The photoluminescence analysis
of single freestanding GaN nanowires reveals a band edge luminescence dominated
by excitonic transitions that are broad and blue shifted compared to bulk GaN,
an effect that is related to the small nanowire diameter and to the presence of
a thick native oxide. The approach developed here can be principally used for

one global model on the cloud for a wide range of classes and then serving
numerous clients, each with heterogeneous images from a small subset of classes
to be recognized. From the cloud-client discrepancies on the range of image
classes, the recognition model is desired to have strong adaptiveness,
intuitively by concentrating the focus on each individual client's local
dynamic class subset, while incurring negligible overhead. In this work, we
propose to plug a new intra-client and inter-image attention (ICIIA) module
into existing backbone recognition models, requiring only one-time cloud-based
training to be client-adaptive. In particular, given a target image from a
certain client, ICIIA introduces multi-head self-attention to retrieve relevant
images from the client's historical unlabeled images, thereby calibrating the
focus and the recognition result. Further considering that ICIIA's overhead is
dominated by linear projection, we propose partitioned linear projection with
feature shuffling for replacement and allow increasing the number of partitions
to dramatically improve efficiency without scarifying too much accuracy. We
finally evaluate ICIIA using 3 different recognition tasks with 9 backbone
models over 5 representative datasets. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of ICIIA. Specifically, for ImageNet-1K with
the backbone models of MobileNetV3-L and Swin-B, ICIIA can improve the testing

functionals defining the problem are smooth. This can cause difficulties when
numerically computing solutions to these problems. While conventional numerical
methods assume state and input trajectories are continuous and differentiable
or smooth, our method is able to capture discontinuities in the solution by
introducing time-mesh nodes as decision variables. This allows one to obtain a
higher accuracy solution for the same number of mesh nodes compared to a fixed
time-mesh approach. Furthermore, we propose to first solve a sequence of
suitably-defined least-squares problems to ensure that the error in the dynamic
equation is below a given tolerance. The cost functional is then minimized
subject to an inequality constraint on the dynamic equation residual. We
demonstrate our implementation on an optimal control problem that has a
chattering solution. Solving such a problem is difficult, since the solution
involves infinitely many switches of decreasing duration. This simulation shows
how the flexible mesh is able to capture discontinuities present in the
solution and achieve superlinear convergence as the number of mesh intervals is
increased.

the exact deformation mechanisms that trigger or inhibit damage initiation
remain mostly unexplored. Whereas generally assumed to be hard and brittle,
lath martensite in fact deforms in a highly anisotropic manner, showing large
strains under favorable habit plane orientations, which is attributed both to
the lath morphology and to so-called 'substructure boundary sliding'. Yet, the
correlation (or interplay) between plasticity and damage in lath martensite has
not received much attention. Therefore, we raise the question whether these
soft martensite plasticity mechanisms can delay or even inhibit damage
initiation. We analyze several 'damage-sensitive' martensite notches, {i.e.
thin contractions of two martensite islands,} by combining several
state-of-the-art experimental and analysis methods. Deformations are tracked
in-situ at the nanoscale, aligned to detailed microstructure maps, and
categorised, for each martensite variant, into habit plane or
out-of-habit-plane slip. In these experiments, strong plasticity (>70%) is
observed in martensite notches, enabled by slip along a favorably oriented
habit plane, whereas damaged notches have unfavorably oriented habit planes,
showing limited pre-damage strains (<10%), carried by out-of-habit-plane slip.
Additionally, one-to-one experimentally based Crystal Plasticity (CP)
simulations are performed in parallel, employing a recently introduced Enriched
CP approach which models a soft plasticity mechanism on the variants' habit
plane. The Enriched CP simulations show considerably lower hydrostatic stresses
in non-damaged and plastically deforming notches, thereby revealing that the
soft habit plane mechanism is key for introducing the high plastic anisotropy
that can lead to the inhibition of martensite damage in highly strained
martensite notches.

the advancement of VSC-based converter technologies, future HVDC systems are
foreseen to develop into meshed HVDC grids. Bipolar HVDC grids can be operated
in an unbalanced way during single pole outages or in form of mixed monopolar
and bipolar grids. However, currently, there are no (optimal) power flow tools
to study the feasibility of such systems. Therefore, we develop an optimal
power flow (OPF) model for hybrid AC-DC grids to capture the DC side unbalances
and allowing to efficiently plan and operate such future grids. In this paper,
we present a multi-conductor OPF model with separate modeling of the positive
pole, negative pole, metallic return conductors, and ground return. The
capabilities of the model are demonstrated on a small test case, including
monopolar tapping over a bipolar DC link. It is demonstrated that the developed
OPF model can capture the loop flows between the different poles in unbalanced

environments have revealed the benefits of maintaining small distances between
robots, especially as they move at higher speeds. However, this is
counter-intuitive in that as speed increases, reducing the amount of space
between robots also reduces the time available to the robots to respond to
sudden motion variations in surrounding robots. However, in certain examples,
the benefits in performance due to traveling at closer distances can outweigh
the potential instability issues, for instance, autonomous trucks on highways
that optimize energy by vehicle ``drafting'' or smaller robots in cluttered
environments that need to maintain close, line of sight communication, etc. To
achieve this kind of closely coordinated fleet behavior, this work introduces a
model predictive optimal control framework that directly takes non-linear
dynamics of the vehicles in the fleet into account while planning motions for
each robot. The robots are able to follow each other closely at high speeds by
proactively making predictions and reactively biasing their responses based on
state information from the adjacent robots. This control framework is naturally
decentralized and, as such, is able to apply to an arbitrary number of robots
without any additional computational burden. We show that our approach is able
to achieve lower inter-robot distances at higher speeds compared to existing
controllers. We demonstrate the success of our approach through simulated and
hardware results on mobile ground robots.

H$_2^+$ + H$_2$ reaction is ideally suited to observe this effect, because the
small reduced mass makes quantum effects related to s-wave scattering
observable at higher collision energies than in other systems. Moreover, the
reaction rate for this barrierless, strongly exothermic reaction follows the
classical Langevin capture model down to cold-collision conditions (about

signals through the use of sparsity. In this paper, we present a new method
that leverages ICA and DL for the identification of directly interpretable
patterns to discriminate between the HC and Sz groups. We use multi-subject
resting-state fMRI data from $358$ subjects and form subject-specific tFNC
feature vectors from ICA results. Then, we learn sparse representations of the
tFNCs and introduce a new set of sparse features as well as new interpretable
patterns from the learned atoms. Our experimental results show that the new
representation not only leads to effective classification between HC and Sz
groups using sparse features, but can also identify new interpretable patterns
from the learned atoms that can help understand the complexities of mental
diseases such as schizophrenia.

prediction techniques for stock market data. Unlike other multivariate
time-series data, stock markets show two unique characteristics: (i)
\emph{multi-order dynamics}, as stock prices are affected by strong
non-pairwise correlations (e.g., within the same industry); and (ii)
\emph{internal dynamics}, as each individual stock shows some particular
behaviour. Recent DNN-based methods capture multi-order dynamics using
hypergraphs, but rely on the Fourier basis in the convolution, which is both
inefficient and ineffective. In addition, they largely ignore internal dynamics
by adopting the same model for each stock, which implies a severe information
loss.
  In this paper, we propose a framework for stock movement prediction to
overcome the above issues. Specifically, the framework includes temporal
generative filters that implement a memory-based mechanism onto an LSTM network
in an attempt to learn individual patterns per stock. Moreover, we employ
hypergraph attentions to capture the non-pairwise correlations. Here, using the
wavelet basis instead of the Fourier basis, enables us to simplify the message
passing and focus on the localized convolution. Experiments with US market data
over six years show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in

the three equilibrium distributions without considering statistical variations.
A general differential equation of thermal equilibrium is obtained that applies
to any particles. Simple integration yields the Boltzmann distribution.
Furthermore, quantum conditions are established, ruling the occupation numbers
of (i) fermions by utilizing Pauli's exclusion principle and (ii) bosons by
utilizing Einstein's rate-equation approach to Planck's law of blackbody
radiation. By exploiting the respective quantum condition, integration of the
same differential equation of thermal equilibrium yields either the Fermi-Dirac
or the Bose-Einstein distribution. It suggests that the Boltzmann distribution
is a general distribution of thermal equilibrium, whereas the Fermi-Dirac and
Bose-Einstein distributions are special cases of the Boltzmann distribution,
ruled by specific conditions. This suggestion is further underlined by the fact
that inserting the respective quantum condition directly into the Boltzmann

This finding implies that fermions and bosons simultaneously obey both their

apply it to the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS v2.0)
dataset. Furthermore, we describe an effective post-processing strategy that
can improve some segmentation metrics. Our method took the first place in the
2022 MICCAI ATLAS Challenge with an average Dice score of 0.6667, Lesion-wise
F1 score of 0.5643, Simple Lesion Count score of 4.5367, and Volume Difference
score of 8804.9102. Our code and trained model weights are publicly available

  Networks: A Joint Computation Offloading and Caching Solution",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nowadays, data caching is being used as a high-speed data storage layer in
mobile edge computing networks employing flow control methodologies at an
exponential rate. This study shows how to discover the best architecture for
backhaul networks with caching capability using a distributed offloading
technique. This article used a continuous power flow analysis to achieve the
optimum load constraints, wherein the power of macro base stations with various
caching capacities is supplied by either an intelligent grid network or
renewable energy systems. This work proposes ubiquitous connectivity between
users at the cell edge and offloading the macro cells so as to provide features
the macro cell itself cannot cope with, such as extreme changes in the required
user data rate and energy efficiency. The offloading framework is then reformed
into a neural weighted framework that considers convergence and Lyapunov
instability requirements of mobile-edge computing under Karush Kuhn Tucker
optimization restrictions in order to get accurate solutions. The cell-layer
performance is analyzed in the boundary and in the center point of the cells.
The analytical and simulation results show that the suggested method
outperforms other energy-saving techniques. Also, compared to other solutions
studied in the literature, the proposed approach shows a two to three times
increase in both the throughput of the cell edge users and the aggregate
throughput per cluster.

  Management in a Latency Critical NFV Application Use-case",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent advancements in the rollout of 5G and 6G have led to the emergence of
a new range of latency-critical applications delivered via a Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) enabled paradigm of flexible and softwarized communication
networks. Evolving verticals like telecommunications, smart grid, virtual
reality (VR), industry 4.0, automated vehicles, etc. are driven by the vision
of low latency and high reliability, and there is a wide gap to efficiently
bridge the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints for both the service providers
and the end-user. In this work, we look to tackle the over-provisioning of
latency-critical services by proposing a proactive SLA management framework
leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to
balance the trade-off between efficiency and reliability. To summarize our key
contributions: 1) we compose a graph-based spatio-temporal multivariate
time-series forecasting model with multiple time-step predictions in a
multi-output scenario, delivering 74.62% improved performance over the
established baseline state-of-art model on the use-case; and 2) we leverage
realistic SLA definitions for the use-case to achieve a dynamic SLA-aware
oversight for scaling policy management with DRL.

interest with applications ranging from thin cylindrical sensors to membrane
like structures. These structures usually interact with their surroundings to
accumulate data, or for a specific purpose. The inevitable interaction between
the surrounding fluid and the solid is solved using a novel Fluid Structure
Interaction (FSI) coupling scheme. This paper proposes a novel way to model the
interaction between fluid and solid. It consists of a hybrid methods that
combines both the traditional monolithic and partitioned approaches for Fluid
Structure Interaction (FSI). The solid mesh is immersed in a fluid solid mesh
at each time iteration, whilst having its own independent Lagrangian
hyperelastic solver. The Eulerian mesh contains both the fluid and solid, and
accommodate additional physical phenomena. Anisotropic mesh adaptation and the
Level-Set methods are used for the interface coupling between the solid and
fluid to better capture the interaction between them. All of the above
components form the Adaptive Immersed Mesh Method (AIMM). The Variational
Multi-Scale (VMS) method is used for both solvers to damp out any spurious
oscillations that may arise for piece wise linear tetrahedral elements. The
framework is constructed in 3D with parallel computing in mind. Various 2D
numerical problems are investigated to evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and
capabilities of our method. Different three dimensional test cases are
presented and are compared to experimental results as well.

  Prediction","6 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables Presented at a workshop in ACM AI in
  Finance conference",,,,"q-fin.GN cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lead recommendations for financial products such as funds or ETF is
potentially challenging in investment space due to changing market scenarios,
and difficulty in capturing financial holder's mindset and their philosophy.
Current methods surface leads based on certain product categorization and
attributes like returns, fees, category etc. to suggest similar product to
investors which may not capture the holder's investment behavior holistically.
Other reported works does subjective analysis of institutional holder's
ideology. This paper proposes a comprehensive data driven framework for
developing a lead recommendations system in holder's space for financial
products like funds by using transactional history, asset flows and product
specific attributes. The system assumes holder's interest implicitly by
considering all investment transactions made and collects possible meta
information to detect holder's investment profile/persona like investment
anticipation and investment behavior. This paper focusses on holder
recommendation component of framework which employs a bi-partite graph
representation of financial holders and funds using variety of attributes and
further employs GraphSage model for learning representations followed by link
prediction model for ranking recommendation for future period. The performance
of the proposed approach is compared with baseline model i.e., content-based
filtering approach on metric hits at Top-k (50, 100, 200) recommendations. We
found that the proposed graph ML solution outperform baseline by absolute 42%,
22% and 14% with a look ahead bias and by absolute 18%, 19% and 18% on
completely unseen holders in terms of hit rate for top-k recommendations: 50,
100 and 200 respectively.

which in theory could be solved with just a few measurements. Here we exploit
the sparsity of the problem and develop an ultra-fast, portable, and

camera can identify materials based on their spectroscopic signatures. This
method does not require prior calibration, making it robust and versatile in
