approaches to investigate the phase diagram of the two-leg $t$-$J$ ladder in
the region of low to intermediate fillings. We choose the same coupling
strength along the leg- and rung-directions, but study the effect of adding a
nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$. We observe a rich phase diagram and
analytically identify a Lifshitz-like band filling transition, which can be
associated to a numerically observed crossover from s-wave to d-wave like
superconducting quasi-long range order (QLRO). Due to the strong interactions,
the Lifshitz transition is smeared into a crossover region which separates two
distinct Luttinger theories with unequal physical meaning of the Luttinger
parameter. Our numerically exact MPS results spotlight deviations from standard
Luttinger theory in this crossover region and is consistent with Luttinger
theory sufficiently far away from the Lifshitz transition. At very low
fillings, studying the Friedel-like oscillations of the local density
identifies a precursor region to a Wigner crystal at small values of the
magnetic exchange interaction $J/t$. We discuss analytically how tuning
parameters at these fillings modifies the phase diagram, and find good
agreement with MPS results.

mechanics is applied post hoc to derive the ensemble properties as a function

needed to model alloys with a large number of components. Doing so also
provides rigorous convergence criteria, including the quantification of noise
due to random sampling, and an estimation of the number of additional samples
required to lower this noise to the needed/desired levels. This method is
well-suited for a variety of cases: i) high entropy alloys, where standard
lattice models are costly; ii) ""medium"" entropy alloys, where both the entropy
and enthalpy play significant roles; and iii) alloys with residual short-range

be a time consuming procedure. For this reason, transferring knowledge from an
expert could potentially boost the overall team performance. In the present
study, transfer learning was integrated in a deep Reinforcement Learning (dRL)
agent. In a real-time and real-world set-up, two groups of participants had to
collaborate with a cobot under two different conditions of dRL agents; one that
was transferring knowledge and one that did not. A probabilistic policy reuse
method was used for the transfer learning (TL). The results showed that there
was a significant difference between the performance of the two groups; TL
halved the time needed for the training of new participants to the task.
Moreover, TL also affected the subjective performance of the teams and enhanced
the perceived fluency. Finally, in many cases the objective performance metrics
did not correlate with the subjective ones providing interesting insights about
the design of transparent and explainable cobot behaviour.

the axion field, whose motion along the potential kicks the dilaton field away
from its minimum, and dilaton starts to oscillate later with a delayed onset
time for oscillation and a relatively large misalignment value due to the kick;
eventually the dilaton dominates over the axion in their energy densities, and
the dilaton is identified as dark matter. The kick effect due to axion motion
is the most significant if the initial field value of dilaton is near its
minimum; therefore, we call this scenario axion free-kick misalignment
mechanism, where axion plays the role similar to a football player. Dark matter
abundance can be obtained with a lower axion decay constant compared to the

a fault tolerant quantum computer to solve previously intractable problems.
Such a machine is not expected to be available until 2030 at least. Thus we are
currently in the so-called NISQ era where more heuristic quantum approaches are
being applied to early versions of quantum hardware. In this paper we seek to
provide a more accessible explanation of many of the more technical aspects of
quantum computing in the current NISQ era exploring the 2 main hybrid
classical-quantum algorithms, QAOA and VQE, as well as quantum annealing. We
apply these methods, to an example of combinatorial optimisation in the form of

different types of mixer (X, XY and a novel 3XY mixer) within QAOA as well as
the effects of many settings for important meta parameters, which are often not
focused on in research papers. Similarly, we explore alternative parameter
settings in the context of quantum annealing. Our research confirms the broad
consensus that quantum gate hardware will need to be much more capable than is
available currently in terms of scale and fidelity to be able to address such
problems at a commercially valuable level. Quantum annealing is closer to
offering quantum advantage but will also need to achieve a significant step up
in scale and connectivity to address optimisation problems where classical

test-time adaption (TTA) continues to adapt the model after deployment.
Recently, the area of continual and gradual test-time adaptation (TTA) emerged.
In contrast to standard TTA, continual TTA considers not only a single domain
shift, but a sequence of shifts. Gradual TTA further exploits the property that
some shifts evolve gradually over time. Since in both settings long test
sequences are present, error accumulation needs to be addressed for methods
relying on self-training. In this work, we propose and show that in the setting
of TTA, the symmetric cross-entropy is better suited as a consistency loss for
mean teachers compared to the commonly used cross-entropy. This is justified by
our analysis with respect to the (symmetric) cross-entropy's gradient
properties. To pull the test feature space closer to the source domain, where
the pre-trained model is well posed, contrastive learning is leveraged. Since
applications differ in their requirements, we address several settings,
including having source data available and the more challenging source-free
setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method 'robust mean
teacher' (RMT) on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks CIFAR10C,
CIFAR100C, and Imagenet-C. We further consider ImageNet-R and propose a new
continual DomainNet-126 benchmark. State-of-the-art results are achieved on all

Considerable effort has been made during the decade following 2008 to develop

physics community to value RBISs use and other forms of student-centered
instruction. This paper uses data from a 2019 survey of 1176 physics
instructors to understand the current state of RBIS use in college-level
introductory physics, thus allowing us to better understand some of the impacts
of these efforts on physics instruction. Results show that self-reported
knowledge and use of RBISs has increased considerably and discontinuation is
now relatively low. However, although the percentage of time lecturing is less
than 10 years ago, many instructors still engage in substantial lecturing.
Relatedly, we find that the majority of RBIS use centers on pedagogies designed
to supplement traditional lecture rather than pedagogies designed to supplement
an active learning classroom. This suggests that the PER community and beyond
has done well promoting knowledge about RBISs and inspiring instructors to try
RBISs in their courses. But, there is still room to improve. We recommend that
change agents focus on supporting instructors to increase the percent of class

forward a ``perturbation + duality'' method to obtain a dual problem for an
original minimization problem. First, one embeds the minimization problem into
a family of perturbed problems (thus giving a so-called perturbation function);
the perturbation of the original function to be minimized has recently been
called a Rockafellian. Second, when the perturbation variable belongs to a
primal vector space paired, by a bilinear form, with a dual vector space, one
builds a Lagrangian from a Rockafellian; one also obtains a so-called dual
function (and a dual problem). The method has been extended from Fenchel
duality to generalized convexity: when the perturbation belongs to a primal set
paired, by a coupling function, with a dual set, one also builds a Rockafellian
from a Lagrangian. Following these paths, we highlight a duality between
Lagrangians and Rockafellians. Where the material mentioned above mostly
focuses on moving from Rockafellian to Lagrangian, we treat them equally and
display formulas that go both ways. We propose a definition of
Lagrangian-Rockafellian couples. We characterize these latter as dual
functions, with respect to a coupling, and also in terms of generalized convex
functions. The duality between perturbation and dual functions is not as clear

observational challenges, including the lack of adequate diagnostic lines in
the near-IR. We present the analysis of K-band spectro-interferometric
observations toward the Massive Young Stellar Object IRAS 13481-6124, which is
known to host an accreting dusty disc. Using GRAVITY on the VLTI, we trace the
crucial au-scales of the warm inner interface between the star and the
accretion dusty disc. We detect and spatially resolve the Na I doublet and He I
transitions towards an object of this class for the first time. The new
observations in combination with our geometric models allowed us to probe the
smallest au-scales of accretion/ejection around an MYSO. We find that Na I
originates in the disc at smaller radii than the dust disc and is more compact
than any of the other spatially resolved diagnostics (Br$\gamma$, He I, and
CO). Our findings suggest that Na I can be a new powerful diagnostic line in
tracing the warm star/disc accreting interface of forming (massive) stars,
while the similarities between He I and Br$\gamma$ point towards an
accretion/ejection origin of He I

outperform human judges in distinguishing human answers versus machine answers.

positioning system based on the time-of-flight (TOF) measurements between
anchors and tags is confronted with the problem of insufficient measurements
caused by blockages to radio signals or lasers, etc. Mounting multiple tags at
different positions of the AGV to collect more TOFs is a feasible solution to
tackle this difficulty. Vehicle localization by exploiting the measurements
between multiple tags and anchors is a rigid body localization (RBL) problem,
which estimates both the position and attitude of the vehicle. However, the
state-of-the-art solutions to the RBL problem do not deal with missing
measurements, and thus will result in degraded localization availability and
accuracy in harsh environments. In this paper, different from these existing
solutions for RBL, we model this problem as a sensor network localization
problem with missing TOFs. To solve this problem, we propose a new efficient
RBL solution based on Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) completion, abbreviated
as ERBL-EDMC. Firstly, we develop a method to determine the upper and lower
bounds of the missing measurements to complete the EDM reliably, using the
known relative positions between tags and the statistics of the TOF
measurements. Then, based on the completed EDM, the global tag positions are
obtained from a coarse estimation followed by a refinement step assisted with
inter-tag distances. Finally, the optimal vehicle position and attitude are
obtained iteratively based on the estimated tag positions from the previous
step. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed
ERBL-EDMC method effectively solves the RBL problem with incomplete
measurements. It obtains the optimal positioning results while maintaining low
computational complexity compared with the existing RBL methods based on

Processing Units (GPUs) is a challenging problem since the hardware
architecture is highly complex and the software frameworks are composed of many
layers of abstraction. While software-level fault injection is a common and
fast way to evaluate the reliability of complex applications, it may produce
unrealistic results since it has limited access to the hardware resources and
the adopted fault models may be too naive (i.e., single and double bit flip).
Contrarily, physical fault injection with neutron beam provides realistic error
rates but lacks fault propagation visibility. This paper proposes a
characterization of the DNN fault model combining both neutron beam experiments
and fault injection at software level. We exposed GPUs running General Matrix
Multiplication (GEMM) and DNNs to beam neutrons to measure their error rate. On
DNNs, we observe that the percentage of critical errors can be up to 61%, and
show that ECC is ineffective in reducing critical errors. We then performed a
complementary software-level fault injection, using fault models derived from
RTL simulations. Our results show that by injecting complex fault models, the
YOLOv3 misdetection rate is validated to be very close to the rate measured

  Ecosystem",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The ability to identify the author responsible for a given software object is
critical for many research studies and for enhancing software transparency and
accountability. However, as opposed to other application markets like iOS,
attribution in the Android ecosystem is known to be hard. Prior research has
leveraged market metadata and signing certificates to identify software authors
without questioning the validity and accuracy of these attribution signals.
However, Android app authors can, either intentionally or by mistake, hide
their true identity due to: (1) the lack of policy enforcement by markets to
ensure the accuracy and correctness of the information disclosed by developers
in their market profiles during the app release process, and (2) the use of
self-signed certificates for signing apps instead of certificates issued by
trusted CAs.
  In this paper, we perform the first empirical analysis of the availability,
volatility and overall aptness of publicly available metadata for author
attribution in Android app markets. To that end, we analyze a dataset of over
2.5 million market entries and apps extracted from five Android markets for
over two years. Our results show that widely used attribution signals are often
missing from market profiles and that they change over time. We also invalidate
the general belief about the validity of signing certificates for author
attribution. For instance, we find that apps from different authors share
signing certificates due to the proliferation of app building frameworks and
software factories. Finally, we introduce the concept of attribution graph and
we apply it to evaluate the validity of existing attribution signals on the
Google Play Store. Our results confirm that the lack of control over publicly
available signals can confuse the attribution process.

causes systematic errors. By introducing stochastic noise in the approximation,
however, one can avoid such systematic errors at the expense of statistical
errors which can be straightforwardly controlled. Therefore in principle, exact
results can be obtained even at finite bond dimension up to the statistical
errors. A previous study of the unbiased method implemented in tensor
renormalization group (TRG) algorithm, however, showed that the statistical
errors for physical quantity are not negligible, and furthermore the
computational cost is linearly proportional to a system volume. In this paper,
we introduce a new way of stochastic noise such that the statistical error is
suppressed, and moreover, in order to reduce the computational cost we propose
common noise method whose cost is proportional to the logarithm of volume. We
find that the method provides better accuracy for the free energy compared with
the truncated SVD when applying to TRG for Ising model on square lattice.
Although the common noise method introduces systematic error originated from a
correlation of noises, we show that the error can be described by a simple
functional form in terms of the number of noises, thus the error can be
straightforwardly controlled in an actual analysis. We also apply the method to
the graph independent local truncation algorithm and show that the accuracy is

combines a fixed feature extractor and a pseudo-features generator to improve
the stability-plasticity balance. The generator uses a simple yet effective
geometric translation of new class features to create representations of past
classes, made of pseudo-features. The translation of features only requires the
storage of the centroid representations of past classes to produce their
pseudo-features. Actual features of new classes and pseudo-features of past
classes are fed into a linear classifier which is trained incrementally to
discriminate between all classes. The incremental process is much faster with
the proposed method compared to mainstream ones which update the entire deep

vanishing multipoles. Nevertheless, it is possible to define finite multipole
ratios for these black holes, by taking the ratio of (finite) multipoles of
supersymmetric multicentered geometries and then taking the black hole scaling
limit of the multipole ratios within these geometries. An alternative way to
calculate these multipole ratios is to deform the supersymmetric black hole
slightly into a non-extremal, rotating black hole, calculate the multipole
ratios of this altered black hole, and then take the supersymmetric limit of
the ratios. Bena and Mayerson observed that for a class of microstate

agreement for the resulting supersymmetric black hole multipole ratios. They
conjectured that this agreement is due to the smallness of the entropy
parameter for these black holes. We correct this conjecture and give strong
evidence supporting a more refined conjecture, which is that the agreement of

membranes consist of a fluid lipid layer into which integral proteins are
embedded. The lipid membrane acts as a two-dimensional liquid in which the
proteins can diffuse and interact. Until today, this view seems very reasonable
and is the predominant picture in the literature. However, there exist broad
melting transitions in biomembranes some 10-20 degrees below physiological
temperatures that reach up to body temperature. Since they are found below body
temperature, Singer & Nicolson did not pay any further attention to the melting
process. But this is a valid view only as long as nothing happens. The
transition temperature can be influenced by membrane tension, pH, ionic
strength and other variables. Therefore, it is not generally correct that the
physiological temperature is above this transition. The control over the
membrane state by changing the intensive variables renders the membrane as a
whole excitable. One expects phase behavior and domain formation that leads to
protein sorting and changes in membrane function. Thus, the lipids become an
active ingredient of the biological membrane. The melting transition affects
the elastic constants of the membrane. This allows for the generation of
propagating pulses in nerves and the formation of ion-channel-like pores in the
lipid membranes. Here we show that on top of the fluid mosaic concept there
exists a wealth of excitable phenomena that go beyond the original picture of
Singer & Nicolson.

terms of stellar mass vs angular size relation and spatial resolution. The
S\'ersic index vs angular size relation, instead, is not reproduced well by the
simulations, mostly because of a paucity of high-mass elliptical galaxies in
TNG50. We also investigate our ability to recover the galaxy kinematics and
stellar population properties with full-spectral fitting. We demonstrate that
'intrinsic' and `recovered' stellar kinematics, stellar ages and metallicities
are consistent, with residuals compatible with zero within 1$-{\sigma}$.
Also`intrinsic' and `recovered' star formation histories display a great
resemblance. We conclude that our mock generation and spectral fitting
processes do not distort the `intrinsic' galaxy properties. Therefore, in the
third paper of this series, we can meaningfully test the cosmological
simulations, comparing the stellar population properties and kinematics of the

Weighted alternating least squares is a very strong competitor for principal
component analysis, in particular if the correlation matrix is the focus of the
study, because it improves the representation of the correlation matrix, often
at the expense of only a minor percentage of explained variance for the

astrometry, over a large range of $(R,z)$ locations. Invoking the complete form
of Jeans equations that admit three integrals of motion, we use the independent
$R$- and $z$-directional equations as two discriminators ($T_R$ and $T_z$). We
apply the formula for spatial distributions of radial and vertical velocity
dispersions proposed by Binney et al., and successfully extend it to azimuthal
components, $\sigma_\theta(R,z)$ and $V_\theta(R,z)$; the analytic form avoids
the numerical artifacts caused by numerical differentiation in Jeans-equations
calculation given the limited spatial resolutions of observations, and more
importantly reduces the impact of kinematic substructures in the Galactic disk.
It turns out that whereas the current kinematic data are able to reject
Moffat's Modified Gravity (let alone the Newtonian baryon-only model),
Milgrom's MOND is still not rejected. In fact, both the carefully calibrated
fiducial model invoking a spherical dark matter (DM) halo and MOND are equally
consistent with the data at almost all spatial locations (except that probably
both have respective problems at low-$|z|$ locations), no matter which a tracer
population or which a meaningful density profile is used. Because there is no
free parameter at all in the quasi-linear MOND model we use, and the baryonic
parameters are actually fine-tuned in the DM context, such an effective
equivalence is surprising, and might be calling forth a transcending synthesis

be small, may or may not cause any systematic effect for precision cosmology.
In this work, we explore the application of the MG formalism to an almost

to the field equations of MG taking the averaged universe to be almost-FLRW
modelled using a linearly perturbed FLRW metric. We study several solutions
with different functional forms of the metric perturbations including plane
waves ansatzes. We find that back-reaction terms are present not only at the

pressure-strain interaction has emerged as an important piece, as it describes
the rate of conversion between bulk flow and thermal energy density. In two
companion studies, we presented an alternate decomposition of the
pressure-strain interaction to isolate the effects of converging/diverging flow
and flow shear instead of compressible and incompressible flow, and we derived
the pressure-strain interaction in magnetic field-aligned coordinates. Here, we
use these results to study pressure-strain interaction during two-dimensional
anti-parallel magnetic reconnection. We perform particle-in-cell simulations
and plot the decompositions in both Cartesian and magnetic field-aligned

pressure-strain interaction during reconnection. This study provides a roadmap
for interpreting numerical and observational data of the pressure-strain
interaction, which should be important for studies of reconnection, turbulence,

isolates the power density due to compressible and incompressible effects,

its identification as collisionless viscous heating troubling. We argue that an

with the pressure dilatation to describe the power density due to
converging/diverging flows, with the balance describing the power density
purely due to shear deformation. We then develop a kinetic theory

fluctuations of their parameters. However, human cognition is inherently

mechanistic cognitive models with a temporal dimension and estimate the
resulting dynamics from a superstatistics perspective. In its simplest form,
such a model entails a hierarchy between a low-level observation model and a
high-level transition model. The observation model describes the local behavior
of a system, and the transition model specifies how the parameters of the
observation model evolve over time. To overcome the estimation challenges
resulting from the complexity of superstatistical models, we develop and
validate a simulation-based deep learning method for Bayesian inference, which
can recover both time-varying and time-invariant parameters. We first benchmark
our method against two existing frameworks capable of estimating time-varying
parameters. We then apply our method to fit a dynamic version of the diffusion
decision model to long time series of human response times data. Our results
show that the deep learning approach is very efficient in capturing the
temporal dynamics of the model. Furthermore, we show that the erroneous
assumption of static or homogeneous parameters will hide important temporal

transfer-based approach where attacks are generated using a substitute model.
While these methods can achieve decent fooling rates, the former tends to be
highly query-inefficient while the latter assumes extensive knowledge of the
black-box model's training data. In this paper, we propose a new attack on
action recognition that addresses these shortcomings by generating
perturbations to disrupt the features learned by a pre-trained substitute model
to reduce the number of queries. By using a nearly disjoint dataset to train
the substitute model, our method removes the requirement that the substitute
model be trained using the same dataset as the target model, and leverages
queries to the target model to retain the fooling rate benefits provided by
query-based methods. This ultimately results in attacks which are more
transferable than conventional black-box attacks. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate highly query-efficient black-box attacks with the
proposed framework. Our method achieves 8% and 12% higher deception rates

the order constraints could not be easily satisfied since some objects occlude
other objects. Those objects occluding others need to be moved more than once
to make the occluded objects accessible. This nonmonotone class of the
rearrangement prob- lem with order constraints becomes harder if multiple
robots are involved, which practically mandates proper computations of robot

using a search such that the order constraint in each group is satisfied. The
search can solve nonmonotone instances that require temporal relocation of some
objects to access the next object to be sorted. Once a complete sorting
sequence is found, the objects in the sequence are assigned to multiple mobile

hold clues into the origins of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In recent
work, coronal lines have been used to unveil a population of candidate
accreting black holes in dwarf galaxies with gas phase metallicities and
stellar masses well below the host galaxies of any previously known AGNs. Using
MUSE/VLT observations, we report the detection of [Fe X] $\lambda$6374 coronal
line emission and a broad H$\alpha$ line in the nucleus of SDSS
J094401.87$-$003832.1, a nearby ($z=0.0049$) metal poor dwarf galaxy almost 500
times less massive than the LMC. The [Fe X] $\lambda$6374 emission is compact
and centered on the brightest nuclear source, with a spatial extent of
$\approx$100 pc. The [Fe X] luminosity is $\approx 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
within the range seen in previously identified AGNs in the dwarf galaxy
population. This line has never been observed in gas ionized by hot stars.
While it can be produced in supernova ejecta, the [Fe X] flux from SDSS
J094401.87$-$003832.1 has persisted over the ~19 year time period between the
SDSS and MUSE observations, ruling out supernovae as the origin for the
emission. The black hole mass measured from the broad H$\alpha$ FWHM and
luminosity is $\approx 3150$ M$_\odot$, in line with its stellar mass if virial
mass relations and black hole-galaxy scaling relations apply in this mass
regime. These observations, together with previously reported multi-wavelength
observations, can most plausibly be explained by the presence of an accreting
intermediate mass black hole in a primordial galaxy analog. However, we cannot
rule out the possibility that current stellar population models of metal poor
stars significantly under-predict the stellar ionizing photon flux, and that

measurements used by operational forecasters for the detection and monitoring
of life-impacting storms. The sampling methods used to produce these
measurements are inherently susceptible to aliasing, which produces ambiguous
velocity values in regions with high winds, and needs to be corrected using a
velocity dealiasing algorithm (VDA). In the US, the Weather Surveillance
Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) Open Radar Product Generator (ORPG) is a
processing environment that provides a world-class VDA; however, this algorithm
is complex and can be difficult to port to other radar systems outside of the
WSR-88D network. In this work, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used to emulate
the 2-dimensional WSR-88D ORPG dealiasing algorithm. It is shown that a DNN,
specifically a customized U-Net, is highly effective for building VDAs that are
accurate, fast, and portable to multiple radar types. To train the DNN model, a
large dataset is generated containing aligned samples of folded and dealiased
velocity pairs. This dataset contains samples collected from WSR-88D Level-II
and Level-III archives, and uses the ORPG dealiasing algorithm output as a
source of truth. Using this dataset, a U-Net is trained to produce the number
of folds at each point of a velocity image. Several performance metrics are
presented using WSR-88D data. The algorithm is also applied to other
non-WSR-88D radar systems to demonstrate portability to other hardware/software
interfaces. A discussion of the broad applicability of this method is
presented, including how other Level-III algorithms may benefit from this
approach.

Approximately two third of survivors develop one or more health complications

standardized for all childhood cancer survivors and not necessarily
personalized for childhood ALL survivors. As a result, late adverse effects may
be underdiagnosed and, in most cases, only taken care of following their
appearance. Thus, it is necessary to predict these treatment-related conditions
earlier in order to prevent them and enhance the survivors' health. Multiple

integrated the usage of neural networks to date. In this work, we developed

created an obesity prediction model using clinical variables that are available

present compelling evidence that this disappearance of optical emission lines

rate leads to a lower flux of ionizing photons and thus to faint/absent
photoionization emission lines in the optical spectrum. We observed the white
dwarf symbiotic RT Cru with XMM-Newton and Swift in X-rays and UV and collected
ground-based optical spectra and photometry over the last 33 years. This

To resolve such issues, we propose an application authentication, where we rely

enrollment process, the application's behavioral data collected from various

releases the key to the server if the application's behavior during the

commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators. After an
introduction of both formalisms, we study the Aharonov-Bohm effect within them
for two specific cases: One determined by a non-zero electric potential, and
another determined by a non-zero magnetic vector potential. Finally, we obtain
a more general description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect that encompasses the two
previous cases and that we prove to be equivalent to the well-known description
of this effect in the usual quantum mechanics formalism in configuration space.

  An aid for identifying and interpreting causal effects involving tautological
  associations, compositional data, and composite variables","18 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deterministic variables are variables that are fully explained by one or more
parent variables. They commonly arise when a variable has been algebraically
constructed from one or more parent variables, as with composite variables, and
in compositional data, where the 'whole' variable is determined from its
'parts'.
  This article introduces how deterministic variables may be depicted within
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to help with identifying and interpreting causal
effects involving tautological associations, compositional data, and composite
variables. We propose a two-step approach in which all variables are initially
considered, and an explicit choice is then made whether to focus on the
deterministic variable(s) or the determining parents.
  Depicting deterministic variables within DAGs bring several benefits. It is
easier to identify and avoid misinterpreting tautological associations, i.e.,
self-fulfilling associations between variables with shared algebraic parent
variables. In compositional data, it is easier to understand the consequences
of conditioning on the 'whole' variable, and correctly identify total and
relative causal effects. For composite variables, it encourages greater
consideration of the target estimand and greater scrutiny of the consistency
and exchangeability assumptions.
  DAGs with deterministic variables are a useful aid for planning and
interpreting analyses involving tautological associations, compositional data,
and/or composite variables.

rich multi-scale local features, and the latter takes advantage of the
self-attention mechanism to encode long-range global information into the

approximation has recently been studied extensively. Much of prior work has
yielded the minimax-optimal bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$,
with $K$ being the number of episodes in the offline data. In this work, we
seek to understand instance-dependent bounds for offline RL with function
approximation. We present an algorithm called Bootstrapped and Constrained
Pessimistic Value Iteration (BCP-VI), which leverages data bootstrapping and
constrained optimization on top of pessimism. We show that under a partial data
coverage assumption, that of \emph{concentrability} with respect to an optimal
policy, the proposed algorithm yields a fast rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{1}{K})$ for offline RL when there is a positive gap
in the optimal Q-value functions, even when the offline data were adaptively
collected. Moreover, when the linear features of the optimal actions in the
states reachable by an optimal policy span those reachable by the behavior
policy and the optimal actions are unique, offline RL achieves absolute zero
sub-optimality error when $K$ exceeds a (finite) instance-dependent threshold.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{1}{K})$ bound and absolute zero sub-optimality bound

prompts and have been found to be highly resistant to catastrophic forgetting
in the well-established rehearsal-free continual learning setting. However, the

the high cost of video annotations. Existing approaches mainly use
convolutional neural networks, yet current revolutionary vision transformer
models have been less explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of
transformer models under the SSL setting for action recognition. To this end,
we introduce SVFormer, which adopts a steady pseudo-labeling framework (ie,
EMA-Teacher) to cope with unlabeled video samples. While a wide range of data
augmentations have been shown effective for semi-supervised image
classification, they generally produce limited results for video recognition.
We therefore introduce a novel augmentation strategy, Tube TokenMix, tailored
for video data where video clips are mixed via a mask with consistent masked
tokens over the temporal axis. In addition, we propose a temporal warping
augmentation to cover the complex temporal variation in videos, which stretches
selected frames to various temporal durations in the clip. Extensive
experiments on three datasets Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 verify the
advantage of SVFormer. In particular, SVFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art
by 31.5% with fewer training epochs under the 1% labeling rate of Kinetics-400.
Our method can hopefully serve as a strong benchmark and encourage future
search on semi-supervised action recognition with Transformer networks.

remove time dependence by steady-state condition, and extend the remaining 2D

Such simplification explicitly models the spatial invariance along horizontal

This introduces a very simple masked image modeling (MIM) method, named
QB-Heat.
  QB-Heat leaves a single block with size of quarter image unmasked and
extrapolates other three masked quarters linearly. It brings MIM to CNNs
without bells and whistles, and even works well for pre-training light-weight
networks that are suitable for both image classification and object detection
without fine-tuning. Compared with MoCo-v2 on pre-training a Mobile-Former with
5.8M parameters and 285M FLOPs, QB-Heat is on par in linear probing on

activations, which can be thought of as the minimal number of factors of
variation in the model's representation of the data. First, we show that common
regularization techniques uniformly decrease the last-layer ID (LLID) of
validation set activations for image classification models and show how this
strongly affects generalization performance. We also investigate how excessive
regularization decreases a model's ability to extract features from data in
earlier layers, leading to a negative effect on validation accuracy even while
LLID continues to decrease and training accuracy remains near-perfect. Finally,
we examine the LLID over the course of training of models that exhibit
grokking. We observe that well after training accuracy saturates, when models
``grok'' and validation accuracy suddenly improves from random to perfect,
there is a co-occurent sudden drop in LLID, thus providing more insight into

cosets. But as we discuss, they can be further extended to the even larger

pave the way for many new examples of T-dualities and consistent truncations.

scale-invariant probability density distribution function (PDF) such that many
small clusters yield the same IMF as one massive cluster of the same combined
number of stars. Observations of the galaxy-wide IMF challenge this as dwarf
galaxies do not form as many massive stars as expected. This indicates a highly
self-regulated star formation process in which stellar masses are not
stochastically sampled from the IMF and are instead related to the environment
of star formation. Here, the nature of star formation is studied using the
relation between the most massive star born in a star cluster and its parental
stellar cluster mass (the $m_{\rm max}$--$M_{\rm ecl}$ relation). This relation
has been argued to be a statistical effect if stars are sampled randomly from
the IMF. By comparing the tightness of the observed $m_{\rm max}$--$M_{\rm
ecl}$ distribution with synthetic star clusters with stochastically sampled
stellar masses, we find that the expected dispersion of the mock observations
is much larger than the observed dispersion. Assuming that $m_{\rm max}$ and
$M_{\rm ecl}$ uncertainties from the literature are correct, our test rejects
the hypothesis that the IMF is a PDF at a more than $4.5\sigma$ confidence
level. Alternatively, we provide a deterministic stellar mass sampling tool
which reproduces the observed $m_{\rm max}$--$M_{\rm ecl}$ distribution and
compares well with the luminosities of star-forming molecular clumps. In
addition, we find that there is a significant flattening of the $m_{\rm

strong feedback of stars more massive than about $13~M_\odot$ and/or the
ejections of the most massive stars from young clusters in the mass range 63 to
$400~M_\odot$ to be likely important physical processes in forming clusters.

the second-order intensity correlation $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the emitted light,
and find strong, unbounded bunching of the emission from systems governed by

those typed by humans or generated by speech recognition models. Previous error
correction methods usually take the source (incorrect) sentence as encoder
input and generate the target (correct) sentence through the decoder. Since the
error rate of the incorrect sentence is usually low (e.g., 10\%), the
correction model can only learn to correct on limited error tokens but
trivially copy on most tokens (correct tokens), which harms the effective
training of error correction. In this paper, we argue that the correct tokens
should be better utilized to facilitate effective training and then propose a
simple yet effective masking strategy to achieve this goal. Specifically, we
randomly mask out a part of the correct tokens in the source sentence and let
the model learn to not only correct the original error tokens but also predict
the masked tokens based on their context information. Our method enjoys several
advantages: 1) it alleviates trivial copy; 2) it leverages effective training
signals from correct tokens; 3) it is a plug-and-play module and can be applied
to different models and tasks. Experiments on spelling error correction and
speech recognition error correction on Mandarin datasets and grammar error

to dark sectors that interact feebly with the Standard Model. We consider dark
sectors interacting with the SM through irrelevant portals that are motivated
on general principles. We derive bounds on such scenarios by considering decays
of dark sector excitations inside the neutrino detector, placed downstream from
the target. Our approach is model agnostic and applies to a wide range of dark
sector models, both strongly and weakly coupled. In this approach, the dark
sector is characterized by two scales: $\Lambda_\text{UV}$ (mass of mediators
generating the portals) and $\Lambda_\text{IR}$ (mass gap of the dark sector).
At intermediate energies, far away from these scales, the theory is
approximately scale-invariant. This allows the calculation of production rates
independent of the threshold corrections, although some mild model-dependent
assumptions are needed. We look at various dark sector production processes
relevant at neutrino experiments such as meson decays, direct partonic
production, and dark bremsstrahlung. We consider representative experiments
from past (CHARM), present (ICARUS, NOvA, MicroBooNE), and upcoming future
(DUNE-MPD), and compare their reach to existing bounds from high energy
experiments (LHC and LEP) and dedicated future LLP experiments (SHiP). We find
that the upcoming DUNE-MPD can probe $\Lambda_\text{UV}$ in the TeV range, and
$\Lambda_\text{IR}$ in the 0.1-1 GeV range, covering parts of parameter space
currently inaccessible in high energy experiments and fixed-target/beam-dump

neutrino experiments can be an efficient probe of dark sectors, providing
complementary as well as new reach in parameter space.

learning of state representations simultaneously with policy learning in an
end-to-end manner when facing large-scale continuous state and action spaces.
However, training such a large policy model requires a large number of
trajectory samples and training time. On the other hand, the learned policy
often fails to generalize to large-scale action spaces, especially for the
continuous action spaces. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an
efficient policy learning method in latent state and action spaces. More
specifically, we extend the idea of state representations to action
representations for better policy generalization capability. Meanwhile, we
divide the whole learning task into learning with the large-scale
representation models in an unsupervised manner and learning with the
small-scale policy model in the RL manner.The small policy model facilitates
policy learning, while not sacrificing generalization and expressiveness via
the large representation model. Finally,the effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated by MountainCar,CarRacing and Cheetah experiments.

emitting blazars detected at very high energies (VHE, $\gtrsim$100 GeV) during
a non-flaring state. It was detected with the MAGIC telescopes during its low
activity in the years 2009-2011, as well as during three flaring activities in
the years 2014, 2019 and 2020, with the highest VHE flux in the latter epoch.
An extensive multi-instrument data set was collected within several coordinated
observing campaigns throughout these years. We aim to characterise the
long-term multi-band flux variability of 1ES 0647+250, as well as its broadband
spectral energy distribution (SED) during four distinct activity states
selected in four different epochs, in order to constrain the physical
parameters of the blazar emission region under certain assumptions. We evaluate
the variability and correlation of the emission in the different energy bands
with the fractional variability and the Z-transformed Discrete Correlation
Function, as well as its spectral evolution in X-rays and $\gamma$ rays. Owing
to the controversy in the redshift measurements of 1ES 0647+250 reported in the
literature, we also estimate its distance in an indirect manner through the
comparison of the GeV and TeV spectra from simultaneous observations with
Fermi-LAT and MAGIC during the strongest flaring activity detected to date.
Moreover, we interpret the SEDs from the four distinct activity states within
the framework of one-component and two-component leptonic models, proposing
specific scenarios that are able to reproduce the available multi-instrument
data.

time-modulated metamaterials of metallic nature by means of Floquet equivalent
circuits. Concretely, we focus on a time-periodic screen that alternates
between ""metal"" and ""air"" states. We generalize our previous approaches by
introducing the concepts of ""macroperiod"" and ""duty cycle"" to the time
modulation. This allows to analyze time-periodic metallic metamaterials whose
modulation ratios are, in general, rational numbers. Furthermore, with the
introduction of the duty cycle, perfect temporal symmetry is broken within the
time modulation as the time screen could remain a different amount of time in
metal and air states. Previous statements lead to an enrichment of the
diffraction phenomenon and to new degrees of freedom that can be exploited in
engineering to control the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic
waves. Finally, we present some analytical results that are validated with a
self-implemented finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach. Results show
that the scattering level and diffraction angles can be controlled
independently by means of the duty cycle and the modulation ratio,
respectively. Thus, novel time-based pulsed sources and beamformers can be
efficiently designed

that the asymptotic dominant term under the null depends only on a function of

faster rate than the asymptotic normal term under the null, while diverges in

charge transfer in non-metals via band bending due to electromechanical,

function differences. Here, we investigate whether the shape of asperities is
important for triboelectricity. The results indicate that the shape is
important in general, since how the electromechanical response scales with
force and asperity size depends on the shape. This is qualitatively in
agreement with experimental results. Further, we discuss how the impact of the
shape depends on material, geometric, and electronic transport details.
Additionally, gradient elasticity is incorporated into the model. As asperity
contact is a nanoscale phenomenon, size-dependent mechanics can become
significant and give more physically reasonable results. In some cases, the
impact of gradient elasticity terms on the electromechanical potentials is very
large, indicating that standard elasticity theory is not enough to cover some
relevant cases in modelling triboelectricity.

energy cutoff on a quantum particle in $\mathbb{R}^D$ in a confining potential
well $V(r)$ with a very sharp minimum on the sphere of radius $r=1$; the cutoff
and the depth of the well diverge with $L\in\mathbb{N}$. As a result, the
noncommutative Cartesian coordinates $\overline{x}^i$ generate the whole

homogeneous polynomials of degree $L$ in the Cartesian coordinates of

${\bf\pi}_L$ of $O(D+1)\supset O(D)$. Moreover, $A_L$ is isomorphic to
${\bf\pi}_L\left(Uso(D+1)\right)$. We resp. interpret

$H_s,A_s$ as $L$ diverges (with $\hbar$ fixed). With suitable
$\hbar=\hbar(L)\stackrel{L\to\infty}{\longrightarrow} 0$, in the same limit
$A_L$ goes to the (algebra of functions on the) Poisson manifold $T^*S^d$; more
formally, $\{A_L\}_{L\in\mathbb{N}}$ yields a fuzzy quantization of a coadjoint

the American diet. To meet the demand for supply chain management and regional
food security, accurate and timely large-scale corn yield prediction is
attracting more attention in precision agriculture. Recently, remote sensing
technology and machine learning methods have been widely explored for crop
yield prediction. Currently, most county-level yield prediction models use
county-level mean variables for prediction, ignoring much detailed information.
Moreover, inconsistent spatial resolution between crop area and satellite
sensors results in mixed pixels, which may decrease the prediction accuracy.
Only a few works have addressed the mixed pixels problem in large-scale crop
yield prediction. To address the information loss and mixed pixels problem, we
developed a variational autoencoder (VAE) based multiple instance regression
(MIR) model for large-scaled corn yield prediction. We use all unlabeled data
to train a VAE and the well-trained VAE for anomaly detection. As a preprocess
method, anomaly detection can help MIR find a better representation of every
bag than traditional MIR methods, thus better performing in large-scale corn
yield prediction. Our experiments showed that variational autoencoder based
multiple instance regression (VAEMIR) outperformed all baseline methods in
large-scale corn yield prediction. Though a suitable meta parameter is
required, VAEMIR shows excellent potential in feature learning and extraction
for large-scale corn yield prediction.

precisely invert the continuous forward process; and 2) the final 2D coordinate

parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing. Our task is graph-conditioned
floorplan generation, a common workflow in floorplan design. We represent a

Our diffusion model employs a Transformer architecture at the core, which
controls the attention masks based on the input graph-constraint and directly

state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, not only due to
outstanding performance it could gain, but also due to plausible innate
explanation for the behaviors of neural architectures it provides, which is
notoriously difficult to analyze. However, recent studies show that attention
is unstable against randomness and perturbations during training or testing,
such as random seeds and slight perturbation of embedding vectors, which
impedes it from becoming a faithful explanation tool. Thus, a natural question
is whether we can find some substitute of the current attention which is more
stable and could keep the most important characteristics on explanation and
prediction of attention. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we provide a
first rigorous definition of such alternate namely SEAT (Stable and Explainable
Attention). Specifically, a SEAT should has the following three properties: (1)
Its prediction distribution is enforced to be close to the distribution based
on the vanilla attention; (2) Its top-k indices have large overlaps with those
of the vanilla attention; (3) It is robust w.r.t perturbations, i.e., any
slight perturbation on SEAT will not change the prediction distribution too
much, which implicitly indicates that it is stable to randomness and
perturbations. Finally, through intensive experiments on various datasets, we
compare our SEAT with other baseline methods using RNN, BiLSTM and BERT
architectures via six different evaluation metrics for model interpretation,
stability and accuracy. Results show that SEAT is more stable against different
perturbations and randomness while also keeps the explainability of attention,
which indicates it is a more faithful explanation. Moreover, compared with
vanilla attention, there is almost no utility (accuracy) degradation for SEAT.

structure and turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM), and without this
""feedback"" the star formation rate (SFR) would be much higher than is observed.
Rapid energy loss in the ISM and efficient energy recovery by stellar feedback
lead to co-regulation of SFRs and the ISM state. Realistic approaches to this
problem should solve the dynamical evolution of the ISM, including star
formation, and the input of feedback energy self-consistently and accurately.
Here, we present the TIGRESS-NCR numerical framework, in which UV radiation,
supernovae, cooling and heating processes, and gravitational collapse are
modeled explicitly. We use an adaptive ray tracing method for UV radiation
transfer from star clusters represented by sink particles, accounting for
attenuation by dust and gas. We solve photon-driven chemical equations to
determine the abundances of H (time-dependent) and C/O-bearing species
(steady-state), which then set cooling and heating rates self-consistently.
Applying these methods, we present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics
simulations of differentially rotating local galactic disks representing
typical conditions of nearby star-forming galaxies. We analyze ISM properties
and phase distributions and show good agreement with existing multiwavelength
galactic observations. We measure midplane pressure components (turbulent,
thermal, and magnetic) and the weight, demonstrating that vertical dynamical
equilibrium holds. We quantify the ratios of pressure components to the SFR
surface density, which we call the feedback yields. The TIGRESS-NCR framework
will allow for a wide range of parameter exploration, including low metallicity
system.

It is, therefore, very important to prepare the community of users of higher
order schemes for hyperbolic PDEs for this emerging opportunity. We focus on
three broad and high-impact areas where higher order Godunov schemes are used.
The first area is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The second is
computational magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) which has an involution constraint
that has to be mimetically preserved. The third is computational
electrodynamics (CED) which has involution constraints and also extremely stiff
source terms. Together, these three diverse uses of higher order Godunov

cases, we show that the optimal use of algorithms, techniques and tricks, along
with the use of OpenACC, yields superlative speedups on GPUs! As a bonus, we
find a most remarkable and desirable result: some higher order schemes, with
their larger operations count per zone, show better speedup than lower order
schemes on GPUs. In other words, the GPU is an optimal stratagem for overcoming
the higher computational complexities of higher order schemes! Several avenues
for future improvement have also been identified. A scalability study is

handled, may lead to the loss of information and biased findings in downstream

Imputation is arguably the most popular method for handling missing data,
though existing imputation methods have a number of limitations. Single
imputation methods such as matrix completion methods do not adequately account
for imputation uncertainty and hence would yield improper statistical
inference. In contrast, multiple imputation (MI) methods allow for proper

settings. Our work aims to address these significant methodological gaps,
leveraging recent advances in neural network Gaussian process (NNGP) from a
Bayesian viewpoint. We propose two NNGP-based MI methods, namely MI-NNGP, that
can apply multiple imputations for missing values from a joint (posterior
predictive) distribution. The MI-NNGP methods are shown to significantly
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real datasets, in
terms of imputation error, statistical inference, robustness to missing rates,

approached exhibits three phases depending on $\alpha_H$ and $\alpha_L$: a
phase where the approach is asymptotically exponential as a result of a gap in
the spectrum of the Lindblad superoperator that generates the dynamics, and two
gapless phases with subexponential relaxation, distinguished by the manner in
which the gap decreases with system size. Within perturbation theory, the phase
boundaries in the $(\alpha_H, \alpha_L)$ plane differ for weak and strong
dissipation, suggesting phase transitions as a function of noise strength. We
identify nonperturbative effects that prevent such phase transitions in the

process can be well-approximated by the two sequential steps of nonlinear
Compton scattering of a polarised real photon followed by its transformation
into an electron-positron pair via nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair creation. We
investigate this two-step process in the intermediate intensity regime by
employing the locally monochromatic approximation for each step and numerically
evaluating resulting expressions. When photon polarisation is included, it is
found to produce an order 10% decrease in the trident rate: the importance of
polarisation increases at lower intensities, and decreases at higher
intensities. Its importance persists at higher intensities in a
linearly-polarised background, but disappears at high intensities in a
circularly-polarised background. If the two steps are made to take place in two
linearly-polarised plane wave pulses with perpendicular polarisations, the pair
yield can be increased by approximately 30% compared to two plane waves with
the same polarisation. It is also shown that harmonic structures in the Compton
step can be passed to the pair step if the Compton edge is at an energy of the
order of the threshold for linear Breit-Wheeler.

fractions of IMBHs in dwarf galaxies are at least 50 percent for galaxies with
stellar masses down to 1E6 Msun, but BH growth is very limited in dwarf
galaxies. In NewHorizon, IMBH growth is somewhat more efficient at high
redshift z = 3 but in general IMBH do not grow significantly until their host
galaxy leaves the dwarf regime. As a result, NewHorizon under-predicts observed
AGN luminosity function and AGN fractions. We show that the difficulties of
IMBH to remain attached to the centres of their host galaxies plays an
important role in limiting their mass growth, and that this dynamic evolution
away from galactic centres becomes stronger at lower redshift.

work, a task-informed DNN-based image denoising method was established and
systematically evaluated. A transfer learning approach was employed, in which
the DNN is first pre-trained by use of a conventional (non-task-informed) loss
function and subsequently fine-tuned by use of the hybrid loss that includes a
task-component. The task-component was designed to measure the performance of a

simple multi-task training fails to improve them. However, a new approach that

study of \emph{testable learning}, where the goal is to replace hard-to-verify
distributional assumptions (such as Gaussianity) with efficiently testable ones
and to require that the learner succeed whenever the unknown distribution
passes the corresponding test. In this model, they gave an efficient algorithm
for learning halfspaces under testable assumptions that are provably satisfied
by Gaussians.
  In this paper we give a powerful new approach for developing algorithms for
testable learning using tools from moment matching and metric distances in
probability. We obtain efficient testable learners for any concept class that
admits low-degree \emph{sandwiching polynomials}, capturing most important
examples for which we have ordinary agnostic learners. We recover the results
of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan as a corollary of our techniques while achieving
improved, near-optimal sample complexity bounds for a broad range of concept
classes and distributions.
  Surprisingly, we show that the information-theoretic sample complexity of
testable learning is tightly characterized by the Rademacher complexity of the
concept class, one of the most well-studied measures in statistical learning
theory. In particular, uniform convergence is necessary and sufficient for
testable learning. This leads to a fundamental separation from (ordinary)
distribution-specific agnostic learning, where uniform convergence is
sufficient but not necessary.

of most query languages for graph databases. RPQs are generally evaluated under
homomorphism semantics; in particular only the endpoints of the matched walks
are returned. Practical applications often need the full matched walks to
compute aggregate values. In those cases, homomorphism semantics are not
suitable since the number of matched walks can be infinite. Hence,
graph-database engines adapt the semantics of RPQs, often neglecting
theoretical red flags. For instance, the popular query language Cypher uses
trail semantics, which ensures the result to be finite at the cost of making
computational problems intractable.
  We propose a new kind of semantics for RPQs, including in particular
simple-run and binding-trail semantics, as a candidate to reconcile theoretical
considerations with practical aspirations. Both ensure the output to be finite
in a way that is compatible with homomorphism semantics: projection on
endpoints coincides with homomorphism semantics. Hence, testing the emptiness
of result is tractable, and known methods readily apply. Moreover, simple-run

Outliers play a significant role, since they bear the potential to distort the
predictions of a machine learning algorithm on a given data set. Especially
among PCA-based methods, outliers have an additional destructive potential
regarding the result: they may not only distort the orientation and translation
of the principal components, they also make it more complicated to detect
outliers. To address this problem, we propose the robust outlier detection
algorithm CoMadOut, which satisfies two required properties: (1) being robust
towards outliers and (2) detecting them. Our outlier detection method using
coMAD-PCA defines dependent on its variant an inlier region with a robust noise
margin by measures of in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD). These
measures allow distribution based outlier scoring for each principal component,
and thus, for an appropriate alignment of the decision boundary between normal
and abnormal instances. Experiments comparing CoMadOut with traditional, deep
and other comparable robust outlier detection methods showed that the
performance of the introduced CoMadOut approach is competitive to well
established methods related to average precision (AP), recall and area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. In summary our approach
can be seen as a robust alternative for outlier detection tasks.

on the training data quality. Our main goal is to understand better the
influence of sample generation strategies on the performance of a greedy
best-first heuristic search guided by a learned heuristic function. In a set of
controlled experiments, we find that two main factors determine the quality of
the learned heuristic: the regions of the state space included in the samples
and the quality of the cost-to-goal estimates. Also, these two factors are
interdependent: having perfect estimates of cost-to-goal is insufficient if an
unrepresentative part of the state space is included in the sample set.
Additionally, we study the effects of restricting samples to only include
states that could be evaluated when solving a given task and the effects of
adding samples with high-value estimates. Based on our findings, we propose
practical strategies to improve the quality of learned heuristics: three
strategies that aim to generate more representative states and two strategies
that improve the cost-to-goal estimates. Our resulting neural network heuristic
has higher coverage than a basic satisficing heuristic. Also, compared to a
baseline learned heuristic, our best neural network heuristic almost doubles
the mean coverage and can increase it for some domains by more than six times.

objects called planetesimals, a formerly large population of objects, of which
asteroids, comets and Kuiper-Belt objects represent the leftovers from planet
formation in our solar system. Here, we follow the paradigm that turbulence
created over-dense pebble clouds, which then collapse under their own
self-gravity. We use the multi-physics code GIZMO to model the pebble cloud
density as a continuum, with a polytropic equation of state to account for
collisional interactions and capturing the phase transition to a
quasi-incompressible solid object, i.e. a planetesimal in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Thus we study cloud collapse effectively at the resolution of the
forming planetesimals, allowing us to derive an initial mass function for
planetesimals in relation to the total pebble mass of the collapsing cloud. The
redistribution of angular momentum in the collapsing pebble cloud is the main
mechanism leading to multiple fragmentation. The angular momentum of the pebble
cloud and thus the centrifugal radius increases with distance to the sun, but
the solid size of the forming planetesimals is constant. Therefore we find that
with increasing distance to the sun, the number of forming planetesimals per
pebble cloud increases. For all distances the formation of binaries occurs
within higher hierarchical systems. The size distribution is top heavy and can
be described with a Gaussian distribution of planetesimal mass. For the
asteroid belt, we can infer a most likely size of 125 km, all stemming from
pebble clouds of equivalent size 152 km.

Sentence-conditioned soft attention over the memories enables effective

possible formation and growth of massive BHs by the tidal capture of stars and
tidal disruption events (TDEs). We model star-BH tidal interactions using a
velocity-dependent drag force, which causes orbital energy and angular momentum
loss near the BH. About $\sim 20-30$ per cent of the stars within the spheres
of influence of the black holes form Bahcall-Wolf cusps and prevent the systems

experience 500 up to 1300 TDEs, depending on the initial cluster structure.
Most ($> 95$ per cent) of the TDEs originate from stars in the Bahcall-Wolf

central BH mass, density and velocity dispersion of the clusters
($\dot{N}_{\mathrm{TDE}} \propto M\mathrm{_{BH}} \rho \sigma^{-3}$). We find
that TDEs can lead a 300 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ BH to reach $\sim 7000

Carlo (MC) methods, we systematically study this system. Near the Fermi level,
the states are mainly contributed by Te $5p$ orbitals hybridized with Mn $3d$
orbitals, resembling a charge transfer system. Furthermore, the spin
orientations of the ferrimagnetic (FiM) ground state display different
conductive behaviors when along the $ab$ plane or out-of-plane directions:
insulating vs. metallic states. The energy difference between the FiM [110]
insulating and FiM [001] metallic phases is very small($ \sim 0.71$ meV/Mn).
Changing the angle $\theta$ of spin orientation from in-plane to out-of-plane
directions, the band gaps of this system are gradually reduced, leading to an
insulator-metal transition, resulting in an enhanced electrical conductivity,
related to the colossal angular magnetoresistance (MR) effect. In addition, we
also constructed the magnetic phase diagram using the classical $XY$ spin model
studied with the MC method. Three magnetic phases were obtained including
antiferromagnetic order, noncollinear spin patterns, and FiM order. Moreover,
we also investigated the Se- and Ge- doping into the Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ system:
the FiM state has the lowest energy among the magnetic candidates for both Se-
or Ge- doped cases. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) decreases in the
Se-doped case because the Mn orbital moment is reduced as the doping $x$
increases. Due to the small spin-orbital coupling effect of Se, the
insulator-metal transition caused by the spin orientation disappears in the
Se-doped case, resulting in an insulating phase in the FiM [001] phase. This
causes a reduced colossal angular MR.

powerful solution for providing both is privacy-preserving computation, where

both confidential computing and control over how data is used. The challenge is
that they incur significant performance overheads compared to plaintext. This
paper proposes a novel garbled circuits accelerator and compiler, named HAAC,
to mitigate performance overheads and make privacy-preserving computation more
practical. HAAC is a hardware-software co-design. GCs are exemplars of
co-design as programs are completely known at compile time, i.e., all
dependence, memory accesses, and control flow are fixed. The design philosophy
of HAAC is to keep hardware simple and efficient, maximizing area devoted to
our proposed custom execution units and other circuits essential for high

understanding to realize hardware's performance potential by generating
effective instruction schedules, data layouts, and orchestrating off-chip
events. In taking this approach we can achieve ASIC performance/efficiency
without sacrificing generality. Insights of our approach include how co-design
enables expressing arbitrary GCs programs as streams, which simplifies hardware
and enables complete memory-compute decoupling, and the development of a
scratchpad that captures data reuse by tracking program execution, eliminating
the need for costly hardware managed caches and tagging logic. We evaluate HAAC

behavior, they suffer from two challenges: 1) The majority of items are
sporadically searched and hence have noisy/sparse query associations, leading
to a \textit{long-tail} distribution. 2) Infrequent queries are more likely to
link to popular items, leading to another hurdle known as
\textit{disassortative mixing}. To address these two challenges, we go beyond
the bipartite graph to take a hypergraph perspective, introducing a new
paradigm that leverages \underline{auxiliary} information from anonymized
customer engagement sessions to assist the \underline{main task} of query-item
link prediction. This auxiliary information is available at web scale in the
form of search logs. We treat all items appearing in the same customer session
as a single hyperedge. The hypothesis is that items in a customer session are
unified by a common shopping interest. With these hyperedges, we augment the
original bipartite graph into a new \textit{hypergraph}. We develop a
\textit{\textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}hannel \textbf{A}ttention-Based
\textbf{H}ypergraph Neural Network} (\textbf{DCAH}), which synergizes
information from two potentially noisy sources (original query-item edges and
item-item hyperedges). In this way, items on the tail are better connected due
to the extra hyperedges, thereby enhancing their link prediction performance.
We further integrate DCAH with self-supervised graph pre-training and/or
DropEdge training, both of which effectively alleviate disassortative mixing.
Extensive experiments on three proprietary E-Commerce datasets show that DCAH
yields significant improvements of up to \textbf{24.6\% in mean reciprocal rank
(MRR)} and \textbf{48.3\% in recall} compared to GNN-based baselines. Our

the intended use of the medicinal product. While extrapolation from adults can
be used to support efficacy of drugs in children, there may be a reluctance to
use the same approach in safety assessments, wiping out potential gains in
trial efficiency through a reduction of sample size. To address this
reluctance, we explore safety review in pediatric trials, including factors
affecting these data, specific types of safety assessments, and precision on
the estimation of event rates for specific adverse events (AEs) that can be
achieved. In addition, we discuss the assessments which can provide a benchmark
for the use of extrapolation of safety that focuses on on-target effects.
Finally, we explore a unified approach for understanding precision using
Bayesian approaches as the most appropriate methodology to describe/ascertain

states of light to encode and transmit information is crucial for the
implementation of a robust and efficient quantum network. In particular, the
large dimensionality of the spatial degree of freedom promises to provide
significant enhancements; however, such promise has largely been unfulfilled as
the necessary level of control over the spatial degree of freedom to encode
information remains elusive. Here, we show that information can be encoded in
the distribution of the spatial correlations of highly multi-spatial mode
entangled bright twin beams. We take advantage of the dependence of the spatial
correlations on the angular spectrum of the pump required for four-wave mixing,
as dictated by phase matching. The encoded information can be extracted by
mapping the momenta distribution of the twin beams to a position distribution
in the far field and measuring the spatial cross-correlation of images acquired
with a high quantum efficiency electron multiplying charge coupled device. We
further show that the encoded information cannot be accessed through individual
beam measurements and that the temporal quantum correlations are not modified.
We anticipate that the ability to engineer the distribution of the spatial
correlations will serve as a novel degree of freedom to encode information and
hence provide a pathway for high capacity quantum information channels and
networks. In addition, a high degree of control over the spatial properties of
quantum states of light will enable real-world quantum-enhanced spatially

gradient descent (SGD) on the loss function (e.g., cross-entropy). In each

sampled from the training set and model parameters are then updated with the
mini-batch gradients. Although the latter provides an unbiased estimation of
the former, they are subject to substantial variances derived from the size and
number of sampled mini-batches, leading to noisy and jumpy updates. To
stabilize such undesirable variance in estimating the true gradients, we
propose In-Training Representation Alignment (ITRA) that explicitly aligns
feature distributions of two different mini-batches with a matching loss in the
SGD training process. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the desirable

possibly stars undergoing caustic crossings. We present revised lensing models

evaluate deep generative models' robustness for population synthesis remain
underexplored. In this study, we present bootstrap confidence interval for the

intervals for mean errors predictions to evaluate the robustness of the models
to multiple datasets. Specifically, we adopt the tabular-based Composite Travel

estimate the distribution of the population, by generating agents that have
tabular data using several samples over time from the same study area. The
models are implemented on multiple travel diaries of Montreal Origin-

performance under varying sample sizes from multiple surveys. Results show that
the predictive errors of CTGAN have narrower confidence intervals indicating
its robustness to multiple datasets of the varying sample sizes when compared

water-based life are well attuned to fundamental constants, adding another
higher-level layer to the anthropic principle. We then discuss viscosity minima

Earth's early atmosphere, and those around other rocky planets, remains unclear
for lack of constraints on the solubility of water in liquids of appropriate
composition. Here we determine water solubility in 14 peridotite liquids,
representative of Earth's mantle, synthesised in a laser-heated aerodynamic
levitation furnace. We explore oxygen fugacities (fO$_2$) between -1.9 and +6.0
log units relative to the iron-w\""ustite buffer at constant temperature
(2173$\pm$50 K) and total pressure (1 bar). The resulting fH$_2$O ranged from 0
to 0.027 bar and fH$_2$ from 0 to 0.064 bar. Total H$_2$O contents were
determined by transmission FTIR spectroscopy from the absorption band at
3550cm$^{-1}$ and applying the Beer-Lambert law. The mole fraction of water in
the liquid is $\propto$ (fH$_2$O)$^{0.5}$, attesting to its dissolution as OH.
The data are fit by a solubility coefficient of 524$\pm$16 ppmw/bar$^{0.5}$,
for a molar absorption coefficient, $\epsilon_{3550}$, of 6.3$\pm$0.3 m$^2$/mol

10-25 % lower than those for basaltic liquids at 1623 K and 1 bar. Higher
temperature lowers water solubility, offsetting the greater depolymerisation of
peridotite melts that would otherwise increase H$_2$O solubility relative to
basaltic liquids. Because the solubility of water remains high relative to that
of CO$_2$, steam atmospheres are rare, although they may form under oxidising
conditions on telluric bodies, provided high H/C ratios prevail.

support, based on a dataset of prior incidents, can provide state-of-the-art
prioritization. However, this data-driven approach, called DISCLOSE, is based
on a heuristic that utilizes only a subset of the available information and
does not approximate optimal decisions. To improve upon this heuristic, we
introduce a principled approach for data-driven decision support for
cyber-forensic investigations. We formulate the decision-support problem using
a Markov decision process, whose states represent the states of a forensic
investigation. To solve the decision problem, we propose a Monte Carlo tree
search based method, which relies on a k-NN regression over prior incidents to
estimate state-transition probabilities. We evaluate our proposed approach on
multiple versions of the MITRE ATT&CK dataset, which is a knowledge base of
adversarial techniques and tactics based on real-world cyber incidents, and
demonstrate that our approach outperforms DISCLOSE in terms of techniques
discovered per effort spent.

model that includes all the symmetry allowed force constants up to third
nearest neighbors, making a total of nine topological phases. We then compute
the ab initio phonon spectra for the two-dimensional crystals of Si, Ge, P, As

physically difficult to realize in real materials with this crystal structure.

suitability of the VQ approach to cell-free AP placement is investigated by
examining three VQ-based solutions. First, the standard VQ approach, that is
the Lloyd algorithm (using the squared error distortion function) is described.
Second, the tree-structured VQ (TSVQ), which performs successive partitioning
of the distribution space is applied. Third, a probability density function
optimized VQ (PDFVQ) procedure is outlined, which enables efficient, low
complexity, and scalable placement, and is aimed at a massive distributed
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scenario. While the VQ-based solutions do
not solve the cell-free AP placement problems explicitly, numerical experiments
show that their sum and minimum rate performances are good enough, and offer a
good starting point for gradient-based optimization methods. Among the VQ
solutions, PDFVQ, with advantages over the other VQ methods, offers a good
trade-off between sum and minimum rates.

spectra of curvature perturbations generated during Gauss-Bonnet (GB) corrected
Higgs inflation in which the inflaton field has not only a nonminimal coupling

this is an important ideal for enhancing confinement. First, we present a weak
formulation, based on the longitudinal adiabatic invariant, generalising
omnigenity. To demonstrate that isodrasticity is strictly more general than
omnigenity, we construct weakly isodrastic mirror fields that are not
omnigenous. Then we present a strong formulation that is exact for
guiding-centre motion. We develop a first-order treatment of the strong version
via a Melnikov function and show that it recovers the weak version. The theory
provides quantification of deviations from isodrasticity that can be used as
objective functions in optimal design. The theory is illustrated on some simple
examples.

several appealing benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, MaskPlace
recasts placement as a problem of learning pixel-level visual representation to

extensive experiments on many public benchmarks show that MaskPlace outperforms

can potentially avoid too small penalty parameters. Moreover, we propose a
framework of inexact Riemannian gradient descent methods to solve the

on the inexact gradient information to improve the performance. We show that
iRBBS can return an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the original PRW distance

detailed local, intermediate, and long-range structural studies are combined

as the key factor producing the large spontaneous polarization in the

sharpening of the structural phase transitions in these BaTiO3 nanoparticles

barium oleate Raman spectra suggest that this component in the composite
core-shell matrix, a product of mechanochemical synthesis, stabilizes an
enhanced polar structural phase of the BaTiO3 core nanoparticles.

security risk in federated Learning caused by groups of malicious Byzantine
attackers or colluders, who conspire to upload vicious model updates to
severely debase global model performances. The proposed framework delineates
the strong consistency and temporal coherence between Byzantine colluders'
model updates from a spectral analysis lens, and, formulates the detection of
Byzantine misbehaviours as a community detection problem in weighted graphs.
The modified normalized graph cut is then utilized to discern attackers from
benign participants. Moreover, the Spectral heuristics is adopted to make the
detection robust against various attacks. The proposed Byzantine colluder
resilient method, i.e., FedCut, is guaranteed to converge with bounded errors.
Extensive experimental results under a variety of settings justify the
superiority of FedCut, which demonstrates extremely robust model performance
(MP) under various attacks. It was shown that FedCut's averaged MP is 2.1% to
16.5% better than that of the state of the art Byzantine-resilient methods. In
terms of the worst-case model performance (MP), FedCut is 17.6% to 69.5% better
than these methods.

artificial neurons. The stochastic switching of magnetic tunnel junction driven
by the spin torque is commonly used to produce the sigmoid activation function.
However, the shape of the activation function in previous studies is fixed
during the training of neural network. This restricts the updating of weights
and results in a limited performance. In this work, we exploit the physics
behind the spin torque induced magnetization switching to enable the dynamic
change of the activation function during the training process. Specifically,
the pulse width and magnetic anisotropy can be electrically controlled to
change the slope of activation function, which enables a faster or slower
change of output required by the backpropagation algorithm. This is also
similar to the idea of batch normalization that is widely used in the machine
learning. Thus, this work demonstrates that the algorithms are no longer
limited to the software implementation. They can in fact be realized by the
spintronic hardware using a single device. Finally, we show that the accuracy
of hand-written digit recognition can be improved from 88% to 91.3% by using
these trainable spintronic neurons without introducing additional energy
consumption. Our proposals can stimulate the hardware realization of spintronic
neural networks.

the presence of the Jovian planet suppresses the detectability of the
Saturn-like planet by $\sim $13% regardless of the adopted detection

achieve good results, the cost of such real-world training data is too high. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for sim-to-real pose estimation, which is
effective on both instance-level and category-level settings. The proposed
method is based on the point-pair voting scheme from CPPF to vote for object
centers, orientations, and scales. Unlike naive point pairs, to enrich the
context provided by each voting unit, we introduce N-point tuples to fuse
features from more than two points. Besides, a novel vote selection module is
leveraged in order to discard those `bad' votes. Experiments show that our
proposed method greatly advances the performance on both instance-level and
category-level scenarios. Our method further narrows the gap between
sim-to-real and real-training methods by generating synthetic training data

nuclear recoils of the up-scattered dark matter and quantitatively reveal that
a large amount of this type of dark matter is arriving from the direction of
the Galactic center. Also, we have shown that the characteristic signatures of
the up-scattered dark matter can be verified with more than 5 $\sigma$
confidence levels in the case of all assumed target atoms in the scope of the

integrals that operates by solving a certain ordinary differential equation in
order to construct an antiderivative of the integrand. It was long believed
that the method suffers from ``low-frequency breakdown,'' meaning that the
accuracy of the computed integral deteriorates when the integrand is only
slowly oscillating. Recently presented experimental evidence suggests that,
when a Chebyshev spectral method is used to discretize the differential
equation and the resulting linear system is solved via a truncated singular
value decomposition, no such phenomenon is observed. Here, we provide a proof
that this is, in fact, the case, and, remarkably, our proof applies even in the
presence of saddle points. We also observe that the absence of low-frequency
breakdown makes the Levin method suitable for use as the basis of an adaptive
integration method. We describe extensive numerical experiments demonstrating
that the resulting adaptive Levin method can efficiently and accurately
evaluate a large class of oscillatory integrals, including many with saddle
points.

strategy for training large models with Differential Privacy (DP). Moreover,
somewhat surprisingly, recent works have found that privately training just the
last layer of a pre-trained model provides the best utility with DP. While past
studies largely rely on algorithms like DP-SGD for training large models, in
the specific case of privately learning from features, we observe that
computational burden is low enough to allow for more sophisticated optimization
schemes, including second-order methods. To that end, we systematically explore
the effect of design parameters such as loss function and optimization
algorithm. We find that, while commonly used logistic regression performs
better than linear regression in the non-private setting, the situation is
reversed in the private setting. We find that linear regression is much more
effective than logistic regression from both privacy and computational aspects,
especially at stricter epsilon values ($\epsilon < 1$). On the optimization
side, we also explore using Newton's method, and find that second-order
information is quite helpful even with privacy, although the benefit
significantly diminishes with stricter privacy guarantees. While both methods
use second-order information, least squares is effective at lower epsilons
while Newton's method is effective at larger epsilon values. To combine the
benefits of both, we propose a novel algorithm called DP-FC, which leverages
feature covariance instead of the Hessian of the logistic regression loss and
performs well across all $\epsilon$ values we tried. With this, we obtain new
SOTA results on ImageNet-1k, CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 across all values of

top-1 accuracy of 88\% under (8, $8 * 10^{-7}$)-DP and 84.3\% under (0.1, $8 *

compatible with the existence of high-spin Cr sites. Further, the value of the
canting angle of the Cr spin axial vector is refined as $\theta_{\rm

relation of scanning spots and dose voxels, our energy selection module selects
a minimum set of energy layers at each gantry angle such that each target voxel
is covered by sufficient scanning spots as specified by the planner, with dose
contributions above the specified threshold. Finally, IMPAT plans are generated
by robustly optimizing scanning spots of the selected energy layers using a
commercial proton treatment planning system. The IMPAT plan quality was
assessed for four ependymoma patients. Reference three-field IMPT plans were
created with similar planning objective functions and compared with the IMPAT
plans. In all plans, the prescribed dose covered 95% of the clinical target
volume (CTV) while maintaining similar maximum doses for the brainstem. While
IMPAT and IMPT achieved comparable plan robustness, the IMPAT plans achieved
better homogeneity and conformity than the IMPT plans. The IMPAT plans also
exhibited higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) enhancement than did

operations, have received much attention in drive-by sensing. Existing studies
have focused on the assignment of sensors to a set of lines or buses with no
operational intervention, which is typically formulated as set covering or
subset selection problems. This paper aims to boost the sensing power of bus
fleets through active scheduling, by allowing instrumented buses to circulate
across multiple lines to deliver optimal sensing outcome. We consider a fleet
consisting of instrumented and normal buses, and jointly optimize sensor
assignment, bus dispatch, and intra- or inter-line relocations, with the
objectives of maximizing sensing quality and minimizing operational costs,
while serving all timetabled trips. By making general assumptions on the
sensing utility function, we formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer
program based on a time-expanded network. A batch scheduling algorithm is
developed following linearization techniques to solve the problem efficiently,
which is tested in a real-world case study in Chengdu, China. The results show
that the proposed scheme can improve the sensing objective by 12.0%-20.5%
(single-line scheduling) and 16.3%-32.1% (multi-line scheduling), respectively,
while managing to save operational costs by 1.0%. Importantly, to achieve the
same level of sensing quality, we found that the sensor investment can be
reduced by over 33% when considering active bus scheduling. Comprehensive
comparative and sensitivity analyses are presented to generate managerial

high-dimensional parametric space using tools from uncertainty quantification
(UQ). The basis adaptation method and its accelerated algorithm in polynomial
chaos expansions (PCE) were recently proposed to construct low-dimensional
approximations adapted to specific quantities of interest (QoI). The present
paper addresses one difficulty with these adaptations, namely their reliance on
quadrature point sampling, which limits the reusability of potentially
expensive samples. Projection pursuit (PP) is a statistical tool to find the
``interesting'' projections in high-dimensional data and thus bypass the
curse-of-dimensionality. In the present work, we combine the fundamental ideas
of basis adaptation and projection pursuit regression (PPR) to propose a novel
method to simultaneously learn the optimal low-dimensional spaces and PCE
representation from given data. While this projection pursuit adaptation (PPA)
can be entirely data-driven, the constructed approximation exhibits mean-square
convergence to the solution of an underlying governing equation and is thus
subject to the same physics constraints. The proposed approach is demonstrated
on a borehole problem and a structural dynamics problem, demonstrating the
versatility of the method and its ability to discover low-dimensional manifolds
with high accuracy with limited data. In addition, the method can learn
surrogate models for different quantities of interest while reusing the same
data set.

pulling force applied to a particular part of the chain, often a free endpoint.
This is in addition to well-studied features such as energetic interaction
between the lattice polymer and a surface. However, the critical behaviour of
the pulling force alone is less well studied, such as characterizing the nature
of the phase transition and particularly the values of the associated
exponents. We investigate a simple model of lattice polymers subject to forced
extension, namely self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on the square and simple cubic
lattices with one endpoint attached to an impermeable surface and a force
applied to the other endpoint acting perpendicular to the surface. In the
thermodynamic limit the system undergoes a transition to a ballistic phase as
the force is varied and it is known that this transition occurs whenever the
magnitude of the force is positive, i.e. $f>f_\text{c}=0$. Using well
established scaling arguments we show that the crossover exponent $\phi$ for
the finite-size model is identical to the well-known exponent $\nu_d$, which
controls the scaling of the size of the polymer in $d$-dimensions. With
extensive Monte Carlo simulations we test this conjecture and show that the
value of $\phi$ is indeed consistent with the known values of $\nu_2 = 3/4$ and
$\nu_3 = 0.587 597(7)$. Scaling arguments, in turn, imply the specific heat
exponent $\alpha$ is $2/3$ in two dimensions and $0.29815(2)$ in three

In this presentation, we note that these statements are true only when one

from baryons that do not appear in the physical spectrum. Because these
unphysical contributions must be eliminated from the sea-quark loop sector via
the connected sector, the assertion that the $\bar d$ and $\bar u$ sea-quark

poses significant concerns over the integrity of the media in circulation. Most
existing deep learning techniques for deepfake detection can achieve promising
performance in the intra-dataset evaluation setting (i.e., training and testing
on the same dataset), but are unable to perform satisfactorily in the
inter-dataset evaluation setting (i.e., training on one dataset and testing on
another). Most of the previous methods use the backbone network to extract
global features for making predictions and only employ binary supervision
(i.e., indicating whether the training instances are fake or authentic) to
train the network. Classification merely based on the learning of global
features leads often leads to weak generalizability to unseen manipulation
methods. In addition, the reconstruction task can improve the learned
representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for deepfake
detection, which considers the reconstruction and classification tasks
simultaneously to address these problems. This method shares the information
learned by one task with the other, which focuses on a different aspect other
existing works rarely consider and hence boosts the overall performance. In
particular, we design a two-branch Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE), in which
the Convolutional Encoder used to compress the feature map into the latent

the input data is fed to a simple classifier and the unsupervised
reconstruction component simultaneously. Our network is trained end-to-end.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance

modeling (MLM) tasks in the NLP pre-training area, numerous masked modeling
tasks have been proposed for VLP to further promote cross-modal interactions.
The core idea of previous masked modeling tasks is to focus on reconstructing
the masked tokens based on visible context for learning local-to-local
alignment. However, most of them pay little attention to the global semantic
features generated for the masked data, resulting in a limited cross-modal
alignment ability of global representations. Therefore, in this paper, we

Specifically, the SCL task complements the missing semantics of masked data by
capturing the corresponding information from the other modality, promoting
learning more representative global features which have a great impact on the
performance of downstream tasks. Moreover, we present a flexible vision

various physical systems. However, the resilience of the system topology to
external perturbations makes it challenging to experimentally investigate
transitions between different phases. In this study, we demonstrate the
transitions of Chern number from 0 to 3, synthesized in an electronic-nuclear
spin system associated with the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond. The
Chern number is characterized by the number of degeneracies enclosed in a
control Hamiltonian parameter sphere. The topological transitions between
different phases are depicted by varying the radius and offset of the sphere.
We show that the measured topological phase diagram is not only consistent with
the numerical calculations but can also be mapped onto an interacting
three-qubit system. The NV system may also allow access to even higher Chern
numbers, which can be applied to exploring exotic topology or topological
quantum information.

on canthaxanthin-binding OCPo and OCPr without laser-induced photoconversion,
we trap them in trehalose glass. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we
show that there is no evidence of long-lived triplet generation through
intramolecular singlet fission, despite the canthaxanthin twist in OCPo.

clinic for the visualization, detection, and diagnosis of various diseases.
However, one bottleneck limitation of MRI is the relatively slow data
acquisition process. Fast MRI based on k-space undersampling and high-quality
image reconstruction has been widely utilized, and many deep learning-based
methods have been developed in recent years. Although promising results have
been achieved, most existing methods require fully-sampled reference data for
training the deep learning models. Unfortunately, fully-sampled MRI data are
difficult if not impossible to obtain in real-world applications. To address
this issue, we propose a data refinement framework for self-supervised MR image
reconstruction. Specifically, we first analyze the reason of the performance
gap between self-supervised and supervised methods and identify that the bias
in the training datasets between the two is one major factor. Then, we design
an effective self-supervised training data refinement method to reduce this
data bias. With the data refinement, an enhanced self-supervised MR image
reconstruction framework is developed to prompt accurate MR imaging. We
evaluate our method on an in-vivo MRI dataset. Experimental results show that
without utilizing any fully sampled MRI data, our self-supervised framework
possesses strong capabilities in capturing image details and structures at high
acceleration factors.

The

Plasma surrounding the main lens causes chromatic deflection of the light rays,
in addition to the gravitational one. As a result, such a lensing system can
generate complicated caustics which depends on the different lensing
parameters. In this work we study the magnification curves for different traces
of the background source and compare the transitions of the formation of ``hill

extra caustic, shrink the central caustics generated by the star and push the
caustic by the planet outwards. Observations and modelling of binary

potential method to study plasma environment of the stars. In case of a high

Text-Enhanced Self-Supervised Speech Pre-training (TESSP), aiming to
incorporate the linguistic information into speech pre-training. Our model
consists of three parts, i.e., a speech encoder, a text encoder and a shared
encoder. The model takes unsupervised speech and text data as the input and
leverages the common HuBERT and MLM losses respectively. We also propose
phoneme up-sampling and representation swapping to enable joint modeling of the
speech and text information. Specifically, to fix the length mismatching
problem between speech and text data, we phonemize the text sequence and
up-sample the phonemes with the alignment information extracted from a small
set of supervised data. Moreover, to close the gap between the learned speech
and text representations, we swap the text representation with the speech
representation extracted by the respective private encoders according to the
alignment information. Experiments on the Librispeech dataset shows the
proposed TESSP model achieves more than 10% improvement compared with WavLM on
the test-clean and test-other sets. We also evaluate our model on the SUPERB

bounding the (causal) treewidth of twin networks -- used in standard
counterfactual reasoning that contemplates two worlds, real and imaginary -- to
the (causal) treewidth of the underlying SCM structure. In particular, we show
that the latter (causal) treewidth is no more than twice the former plus one.

spatial patterns in nature and engineering. These systems are governed by a set
of non-linear partial differential equations containing parameters that
determine the rate of constituent diffusion and reaction. Critically, these
parameters, such as diffusion coefficient, heavily influence the mode and type
of the final pattern, and quantitative characterization and knowledge of these
parameters can aid in bio-mimetic design or understanding of real-world
systems. However, the use of numerical methods to infer these parameters can be
difficult and computationally expensive. Typically, adjoint solvers may be
used, but they are frequently unstable for very non-linear systems.
Alternatively, massive amounts of iterative forward simulations are used to
find the best match, but this is extremely effortful. Recently,
physics-informed neural networks have been proposed as a means for data-driven
discovery of partial differential equations, and have seen success in various
applications. Thus, we investigate the use of physics-informed neural networks
as a tool to infer key parameters in reaction-diffusion systems in the
steady-state for scientific discovery or design. Our proof-of-concept results
show that the method is able to infer parameters for different pattern modes
and types with errors of less than 10\%. In addition, the stochastic nature of
this method can be exploited to provide multiple parameter alternatives to the
desired pattern, highlighting the versatility of this method for bio-mimetic

accessibility and effectiveness. However, there is a chronic shortage of
well-trained radiologists who can interpret these images and diagnose the
patient's condition. Therefore, automated radiology report generation can be a
very helpful tool in clinical practice. A typical report generation workflow
consists of two main steps: (i) encoding the image into a latent space and (ii)
generating the text of the report based on the latent image embedding. Many
existing report generation techniques use a standard convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture for image encoding followed by a Transformer-based
decoder for medical text generation. In most cases, CNN and the decoder are
trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. In this work, we primarily focus on
understanding the relative importance of encoder and decoder components.
Towards this end, we analyze four different image encoding approaches: direct,
fine-grained, CLIP-based, and Cluster-CLIP-based encodings in conjunction with
three different decoders on the large-scale MIMIC-CXR dataset. Among these
encoders, the cluster CLIP visual encoder is a novel approach that aims to
generate more discriminative and explainable representations. CLIP-based
encoders produce comparable results to traditional CNN-based encoders in terms
of NLP metrics, while fine-grained encoding outperforms all other encoders both
in terms of NLP and clinical accuracy metrics, thereby validating the
importance of image encoder to effectively extract semantic information. GitHub

strong augmentations, which distort the images/skeletons' structures and cause

investigate the potential of adopting strong augmentations and propose a

skeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, we first design a gradual
growing augmentation policy to generate multiple ordered positive pairs, which
guide to achieve the consistency of the learned representation from different
views. Then, an asymmetric loss is proposed to enforce the hierarchical
consistency via a directional clustering operation in the feature space,
pulling the representations from strongly augmented views closer to those from
weakly augmented views for better generalizability. Meanwhile, we propose and
evaluate three kinds of strong augmentations for 3D skeletons to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments show that HiCLR

reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs). Currently, most approaches are limited to
queries among binary relational facts and pay less attention to n-ary facts
(n>=2) containing more than two entities, which are more prevalent in the real
world. Moreover, previous CQA methods can only make predictions for a few given
types of queries and cannot be flexibly extended to more complex logical
queries, which significantly limits their applications. To overcome these
challenges, in this work, we propose a novel N-ary Query Embedding (NQE) model
for CQA over hyper-relational knowledge graphs (HKGs), which include massive
n-ary facts. The NQE utilizes a dual-heterogeneous Transformer encoder and
fuzzy logic theory to satisfy all n-ary FOL queries, including existential
quantifiers, conjunction, disjunction, and negation. We also propose a parallel
processing algorithm that can train or predict arbitrary n-ary FOL queries in a
single batch, regardless of the kind of each query, with good flexibility and
extensibility. In addition, we generate a new CQA dataset WD50K-NFOL, including
diverse n-ary FOL queries over WD50K. Experimental results on WD50K-NFOL and

visual search. Meanwhile, context is of critical importance for locating a
target object in complex scenes as it helps narrow down the search area and
makes the search process more efficient. However, few works have combined both
target and context information in visual search computational models. Here we
propose a zero-shot deep learning architecture, TCT (Target and Context-aware
Transformer), that modulates self attention in the Vision Transformer with
target and contextual relevant information to enable human-like zero-shot
visual search performance. Target modulation is computed as patch-wise local
relevance between the target and search images, whereas contextual modulation
is applied in a global fashion. We conduct visual search experiments on TCT and
other competitive visual search models on three natural scene datasets with
varying levels of difficulty. TCT demonstrates human-like performance in terms
of search efficiency and beats the SOTA models in challenging visual search
tasks. Importantly, TCT generalizes well across datasets with novel objects
without retraining or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we also introduce a new dataset
to benchmark models for invariant visual search under incongruent contexts. TCT
manages to search flexibly via target and context modulation, even under
incongruent contexts.

emerging topics naturally forms a long-tailed video distribution in terms of
their categories, and it spotlights the need for Video Long-Tailed Recognition
(VLTR). In this work, we summarize the challenges in VLTR and explore how to
overcome them. The challenges are: (1) it is impractical to re-train the whole
model for high-quality features, (2) acquiring frame-wise labels requires
extensive cost, and (3) long-tailed data triggers biased training. Yet, most
existing works for VLTR unavoidably utilize image-level features extracted from
pretrained models which are task-irrelevant, and learn by video-level labels.
Therefore, to deal with such (1) task-irrelevant features and (2) video-level
labels, we introduce two complementary learnable feature aggregators. Learnable
layers in each aggregator are to produce task-relevant representations, and
each aggregator is to assemble the snippet-wise knowledge into a video
representative. Then, we propose Minority-Oriented Vicinity Expansion (MOVE)
that explicitly leverages the class frequency into approximating the vicinity
distributions to alleviate (3) biased training. By combining these solutions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale VideoLT and
synthetically induced Imbalanced-MiniKinetics200. With VideoLT features from

ordering of these mesons flips around the quark chemical potential
$\mu=m^{0}_{\pi}/2$ ($m^{0}_{\pi}$: the pion mass at $\mu=0$), where the phase
transition between the hadronic and superfluid phases occurs. For $\mu \gtrsim
m^{0}_{\pi}/2$, the effective mass for the pion linearly increases while the
one for the rho meson monotonically decreases. Furthermore, we measure hadron
spectra with the isospin $I=0$ and the angular momentum $J^{P}=0^{\pm}$. The
effective masses for the meson, diquark, and antidiquark with the same quantum
number become degenerate just below $\mu = m^{0}_{\pi}/2$, and the three
hadrons have the same mass in the superfluid phase. It suggests that mixing
occurs between spectra associating with mesons and baryons due to the
$U(1)_{B}$ symmetry breaking. This phenomenon can be explained in the linear
sigma model with the approximate $SU(4)$ Pauli-Gursey symmetry.

Although DRL has achieved important advancements in this field, the existing
works pay little attention to the explainability and safety issues related to
DRL controllers, particularly the safety under adversarial attacks. To address
those two issues, we design a fully explainable DRL framework wherein we: 1)
decompose the coupled Q value learning model into a safety-awareness and
efficiency (reach the target) one; and 2) use information from surrounding
intruders as inputs, eliminating the needs of central controllers. In our
simulated experiments, we show that by decoupling the safety-awareness and
efficiency, we can exceed performance on free flight control tasks while
dramatically improving explainability on practical. In addition, the safety Q
learning module provides rich information about the safety situation of
environments. To study the safety under adversarial attacks, we additionally
propose an adversarial attack strategy that can impose both safety-oriented and
efficiency-oriented attacks. The adversarial aims to minimize safety/efficiency
by only attacking the agent at a few time steps. In the experiments, our attack
strategy increases as many collisions as the uniform attack (i.e., attacking at
every time step) by only attacking the agent four times less often, which
provide insights into the capabilities and restrictions of the DRL in future
ATC designs. The source code is publicly available at

  Using two large spectroscopic campaigns towards massive stars in 30 Doradus,
we aim to provide observational constraints on the properties of the O-type
runaway population in the most massive active star-forming region in the Local
group.
  We use RV measurements of the O-type star populations in 30 Doradus obtained
by the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey and the Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring
to identify single and binary O-type runaways. We discuss their rotational
properties and qualitatively compare observations with expectations of ejection
scenarios.
  We identify 23 single and one binary O-type runaway objects, most of them
outside the main star-forming regions in 30 Doradus. We find an overabundance
of rapid rotators (vsini > 200km/s) among the runaway population, providing an
explanation of the overabundance of rapidly rotating stars in the 30 Doradus
field. Considerations of the projected rotation rates and runaway line-of-sight
(los) velocities reveal a conspicuous absence of rapidly rotating (vsini >
210k/ms), fast moving (v_{los} > 60km/s) runaways, and suggest the presence of
two different populations of runaway stars: a population of rapidly-spinning
but slowly moving runaways and a population of fast moving but slowly rotating
ones. These are detected with a ratio close to 2:1 in our sample.
  We argue that slowly moving but rapidly spinning runaways result from binary
ejections, while rapidly moving but slowly spinning runaways could result from
dynamical ejections. Given that detection biases will more strongly impact the
slow-moving population, our results suggest that the binary evolution scenario
dominates the current massive runaway population in 30 Doradus.

spatio-temporal model using a strategic modification of the Hamiltonian

resultant sptaio-temporal process, continuously varying with time, turns out to
be nonparametric, nonstationary, nonseparable and no-Gaussian. Besides, the
lagged correlations tend to zero as the spatio-temporal lag tends to infinity.
We investigate the theoretical properties of the new spatio-temporal process,
along with its continuity and smoothness properties. Considering the Bayesian
paradigm, we derive methods for complete Bayesian inference using MCMC

  Reconstruction and Its Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Applications","14 pages",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exponential function is a fundamental signal form in general signal
processing and biomedical applications, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy
and imaging. How to reduce the sampling time of these signals is an important
problem. Sub-Nyquist sampling can accelerate signal acquisition but bring in
artifacts. Recently, the low rankness of these exponentials has been applied to
implicitly constrain the deep learning network through the unrolling of low
rank Hankel factorization algorithm. However, only depending on the implicit
low rank constraint cannot provide the robust reconstruction, such as sampling
rate mismatches. In this work, by introducing the explicit low rank prior to
constrain the deep learning, we propose an Alternating Deep Low Rank approach
(ADLR) that utilizes deep learning and optimization solvers alternately. The
former solver accelerates the reconstruction while the latter one corrects the
reconstruction error from the mismatch. The experiments on both general
exponential functions and realistic biomedical magnetic resonance data show
that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, ADLR can achieve much lower
reconstruction error and effectively alleviates the decrease of reconstruction
quality with sampling rate mismatches.

we consider a bidisperse mixture of spheroids of equal volume in a rotating
drum, where the two mechanisms are predicted to act in opposite directions. We
present the first evidence that there are two \emph{distinct} segregation
mechanisms driven by relative \emph{over-stress}. Additionally, we showed that
for non-spherical particles, these two mechanisms can act in different
directions leading to a competition between the effects of the two. As a
result, the segregation intensity varies non-monotonically as a function of
$AR$, and at specific points, the segregation direction changes for both
prolate and oblate spheroids, explaining the surprising segregation reversal
previously reported. Consistent with previous results, we found that the
kinetic mechanism is dominant for (almost) spherical particles. Furthermore,
for moderate aspect ratios, the kinetic mechanism is responsible for the
spherical particles segregation to the periphery of the drum, and the gravity
mechanism plays only a minor role. Whereas, at the extreme values of $AR$, the
gravity mechanism notably increases and overtakes its kinetic counterpart.

  Representation","Accepted by CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised facial representation has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to perform face understanding without relying on
large-scale annotated datasets heavily. However, analytically, current
contrastive-based self-supervised learning (SSL) still performs
unsatisfactorily for learning facial representation. More specifically,
existing contrastive learning (CL) tends to learn pose-invariant features that
cannot depict the pose details of faces, compromising the learning performance.
To conquer the above limitation of CL, we propose a novel Pose-disentangled
Contrastive Learning (PCL) method for general self-supervised facial
representation. Our PCL first devises a pose-disentangled decoder (PDD) with a
delicately designed orthogonalizing regulation, which disentangles the
pose-related features from the face-aware features; therefore, pose-related and
other pose-unrelated facial information could be performed in individual
subnetworks and do not affect each other's training. Furthermore, we introduce
a pose-related contrastive learning scheme that learns pose-related information
based on data augmentation of the same image, which would deliver more
effective face-aware representation for various downstream tasks. We conducted
linear evaluation on four challenging downstream facial understanding tasks,
ie, facial expression recognition, face recognition, AU detection and head pose
estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1302.2163, arXiv:1108.0375",,,,"math.KT","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The category of framed correspondences $Fr_*(k)$ was invented by Voevodsky in
his notes in order to give another framework for SH(k) more amenable to
explicit calculations. Based on that notes and on their JAMS paper Garkusha and
the author introduced in a very recent paper a triangulated category of framed
bispectra $\text{SH}_{nis}^{fr}(k)$. It is shown in the latter paper that
$\text{SH}_{nis}^{fr}(k)$ recovers classical Morel-Voevodsky triangulated
category of bispectra $\text{SH}(k)$. For any infinite perfect field $k$ a
triangulated category of $\mathbb{F}\text{r}$-motives
$\text{D}\mathbb{F}\text{r}_{-}^{eff}(k)$ is constructed in the style of the
Voevodsky construction of the category $\text{DM}_-^{eff}(k)$. In our approach
the Voevodsky category of Nisnevich sheaves with transfers is replaced with the
category of $\mathbb{F}\text{r}$-modules. To each smooth $k$-variety $X$ the
$\mathbb{F}\text{r}$-motive $\text{M}_{\mathbb{F}\text{r}}(X)$ is associated in
the category $\text{D}\mathbb{F}\text{r}_{-}^{eff}(k)$. We identify the
triangulated category $\text{D}\mathbb{F}\text{r}_{-}^{eff}(k)$ with the full
triangulated subcategory $\text{SH}^{eff}_{-}(k)$ of the classical
Morel-Voevodsky triangulated category $\text{SH}^{eff}(k)$ of effective motivic
bispectra. Moreover, the triangulated category
$\text{D}\mathbb{F}\text{r}_{-}^{eff}(k)$ is naturally symmetric monoidal. The
mentioned identification of the triangulated categories respects the symmetric
monoidal structures on both sides.

lifting. The variables that parametrize robot's kinematics and dynamics ensure
their physical consistency, and the human model is considered in the
optimization problem. By leveraging the proposed modelling framework, the
ergonomy of the interaction is maximized, here given by the agents' energy
expenditure. Robot kinematic, dynamics, hardware constraints and human

proposed methodology is used to identify optimum hardware parameters for the
design of the ergoCub robot, a humanoid possessing a degree of embodied

problem, the starting point is the iCub humanoid robot. The obtained robot

anomalous magnetic moment is suppressed, thus increasing the signal-to-noise
ratio for EDM signals to achieve a sensitivity otherwise unattainable using
conventional $g-2$ muon storage rings. The expected statistical sensitivity for
the EDM after a year of data taking is $6\times 10^{-23} e\cdot$cm with the $p

  the General Analytical Solution and Applications in Viral Dynamics",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifiability is a structural property of any ODE model characterized by a
set of unknown parameters. It describes the possibility of determining the
values of these parameters from fusing the observations of the system inputs
and outputs. This paper finds the general analytical solution of this
fundamental problem and, based on this, provides a general and automated
analytical method to determine the identifiability of the unknown parameters.
In particular, the method can handle any model, regardless of its complexity
and type of non-linearity, and provides the identifiability of the parameters
even when they are time-varying. In addition, it is automatic as it simply
needs to follow the steps of a systematic procedure that only requires to
perform the calculation of derivatives and matrix ranks. Time-varying
parameters are treated as unknown inputs and their identification is based on
the very recent analytical solution of the unknown input observability problem
[1, 2]. The method is used to determine the identifiability of the unknown
time-varying parameters that characterize two non-linear models in the field of
viral dynamics (HIV and Covid-19). New fundamental properties that characterize
these viral models are determined and discussed in detail through a comparison
with the state-of-the-art results. In particular, regarding the very popular
HIV ODE model here investigated, the method automatically finds a new important
result that is in contrast with the results in the current literature.

evolution of solar-type stars. Recent asteroseismic observation detected the
strong equator-fast DR in some solar-type stars. Numerical simulations show
that the strong equator-fast DR is a typical feature of young fast-rotating
stars and that this tendency is gradually reduced with stellar age.
Incorporating these properties, we develop a model for the long-term evolution
of stellar rotation. The magnetic braking is assumed to be regulated dominantly
by the rotation rate in the low-latitude region. Therefore, in our model, stars
with the equator-fast DR spin down more efficiently than those with the
rigid-body rotation. We calculate the evolution of stellar rotation in ranges
of stellar mass, $0.9 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \le M \le 1.2\,
\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and metallicity, $0.5\, \mathrm{Z}_{\odot} \le Z \le 2\,
\mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$, where $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $\mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$ are
the solar mass and metallicity, respectively. Our model, using the observed
torque in the present solar wind, nicely explains both the current solar
rotation and the average trend of the rotation of solar-type stars, including
the dependence on metallicity. In addition, our model naturally reproduces the
observed trend of the weakened magnetic braking in old slowly rotating
solar-type stars because strong equator-fast DR becomes reduced. Our results
indicate that LDR and its transition are essential factors that control the
stellar spin down.

be easily applied to state-of-the-art GAN Prior based SR methods to eliminate
their inconsistencies, neither compromising the realness nor bringing extra

can replace pixel-wise losses for training and achieve better generalization

paramount. A potential solution, particularly for libraries and frameworks, is
regularly executing software microbenchmarks, a performance testing technique
similar to (functional) unit tests. This often becomes infeasible due to the
extensive runtimes of microbenchmark suites, however. To address that
challenge, research has investigated regression testing techniques, such as
test case prioritization (TCP), which reorder the execution within a
microbenchmark suite to detect larger performance changes sooner. Such
techniques are either designed for unit tests and perform sub-par on
microbenchmarks or require complex performance models, reducing their potential
application drastically. In this paper, we propose a search-based technique
based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to improve the current
state of microbenchmark prioritization. The technique utilizes three
objectives, i.e., coverage to maximize, coverage overlap to minimize, and
historical performance change detection to maximize. We find that our technique
improves over the best coverage-based, greedy baselines in terms of average
percentage of fault-detection on performance (APFD-P) and Top-3 effectiveness
by 26 percentage points (pp) and 43 pp (for Additional) and 17 pp and 32 pp

MOEAs. Finally, the technique's runtime overhead is acceptable at 19% of the
overall benchmark suite runtime, if we consider the enormous runtimes often

miniscule at 1%.These results mark a step forward for universally applicable

Among these systems, SmFeO$_3$ is attracting a particular interest for its rich

Therefore, unauthorized redistribution of private pre-trained DNNs may cause

this goal, DEEPTASTER generates a few adversarial images with perturbations,
transforms them into the Fourier frequency domain, and uses the transformed
images to identify the dataset used in a suspect model. The intuition is that
those adversarial images can be used to capture the characteristics of DNNs
built on a specific dataset. We evaluated the detection accuracy of DEEPTASTER
on three datasets with three model architectures under various attack
scenarios, including transfer learning, pruning, fine-tuning, and data
augmentation. Overall, DEEPTASTER achieves a balanced accuracy of 94.95%, which
is significantly better than 61.11% achieved by DEEPJUDGE in the same settings.

modeled by the Jacobi ensemble of random matrices. A key quantity for assessing
the performance of MIMO systems is the mutual information (MI). We focus here
on the case of an arbitrary transmission covariance matrix and derive exact
determinant based results for the moment generating function (MGF) of mutual
information (MI), and thereby address the scenario of unequal power per excited
mode. The MGF is used to obtain Gaussian- and Weibull-distribution based
approximations for the probability density function (PDF), cumulative

the survival function (SF) or reliability function. Moreover, a numerical
Fourier inversion approach is implemented to obtain the PDF, CDF, and SF

capacity, which is the first moment (mean) of the mutual information. The
analytical results are found to be in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo

are available to allow system adjustment to changing quality conditions due to
device changes. This system adjustment is referred to as quality-based
conditional processing. The proposed fusion approach is based on linear
logistic regression, in which fused scores tend to be log-likelihood-ratios.
This allows the easy and efficient combination of matching scores from
different devices assuming low dependence among modalities. In our system,
quality information is used to switch between different system modules

a fixed-size committee to parties based on the approval ballots of the voters
over the parties. In particular, each voter can approve multiple parties and
each party can be assigned multiple seats. Two central requirements in this
setting are proportional representation and strategyproofness. Intuitively,
proportional representation requires that every sufficiently large group of
voters with similar preferences is represented in the committee.
Strategyproofness demands that no voter can benefit by misreporting her true
preferences. We show that these two axioms are incompatible for anonymous
party-approval multiwinner voting rules, thus proving a far-reaching
impossibility theorem. The proof of this result is obtained by formulating the
problem in propositional logic and then letting a SAT solver show that the
formula is unsatisfiable. Additionally, we demonstrate how to circumvent this
impossibility by considering a weakening of strategy\-proofness which requires
that only voters who do not approve any elected party cannot manipulate. While
most common voting rules fail even this weak notion of strategyproofness, we
characterize Chamberlin--Courant approval voting within the class of Thiele
rules based on this strategyproofness notion.

arbitrarily small local spectral expansion.
  We give a randomized algorithm that takes as input a high dimensional
expander $X$ (satisfying some mild assumptions). It outputs a sub-complex $Y

its links are sparsifications of the links of $X$. When the size of the links
of $X$ is $O(\log |X|)$, this algorithm can be made deterministic. Our
algorithm is based on the groups and generating sets discovered by Lubotzky,
Samuels and Vishne (2005), that were used to construct the first discovered
high dimensional expanders. We show these groups give rise to many more
``randomized'' high dimensional expanders.
  In addition, our techniques also give a random sparsification algorithm for
high dimensional expanders, that maintains its local spectral properties. This

collaboratively without sharing the local training data. However, the expensive
annotation cost to acquire data labels on local clients remains an obstacle in
utilizing local data. In this paper, we propose a federated active learning
paradigm to efficiently learn a global model with limited annotation budget
while protecting data privacy in a decentralized learning way. The main
challenge faced by federated active learning is the mismatch between the active
sampling goal of the global model on the server and that of the asynchronous
local clients. This becomes even more significant when data is distributed
non-IID across local clients. To address the aforementioned challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Aware Federated Active Learning (KAFAL), which consists of
Knowledge-Specialized Active Sampling (KSAS) and Knowledge-Compensatory
Federated Update (KCFU). KSAS is a novel active sampling method tailored for
the federated active learning problem. It deals with the mismatch challenge by
sampling actively based on the discrepancies between local and global models.
KSAS intensifies specialized knowledge in local clients, ensuring the sampled
data to be informative for both the local clients and the global model. KCFU,
in the meantime, deals with the client heterogeneity caused by limited data and
non-IID data distributions. It compensates for each client's ability in weak

provide similar performance with fewer RF chains. In this regard, the system
aims to maximize the SE with respect to optimum beamforming design and RA mode

the proposed MAB, the computational complexity of the optimization problem is
reduced. Finally, the proposed methods in both dynamic and static scenarios are

method (SP-PFEM) to simulate the motion of closed curves governed by
area-conserved generalized mean curvature flow in two dimensions (2D). We first
present a variational formulation and rigorously prove that it preserves two
fundamental geometric structures of the flows, i.e., (a) the conservation of
the area enclosed by the closed curve; (b) the decrease of the perimeter of the
curve. Then the variational formulation is approximated by using piecewise
linear parametric finite elements in space to develop the semi-discrete scheme.
With the help of the discrete Cauchy's inequality and discrete power mean
inequality, the area conservation and perimeter decrease properties of the
semi-discrete scheme are shown. On this basis, by combining the backward Euler
method in time and a proper approximation of the unit normal vector, a
structure-preserving fully discrete scheme is constructed successfully, which
can preserve the two essential geometric structures simultaneously at the
discrete level. Finally, numerical experiments test the convergence rate, area
conservation, perimeter decrease and mesh quality, and depict the evolution of
curves. Numerical results indicate that the proposed SP-PFEM provides a
reliable and powerful tool for the simulation of area-conserved generalized

manually labelling representative data samples for training. Meanwhile, recent
active learning applications have benefited a lot from cloud computing services
with not only sufficient computational resources but also crowdsourcing
frameworks that include many humans in the active learning loop. However,
previous active learning methods that always require passing large-scale
unlabelled data to cloud may potentially raise significant data privacy issues.
To mitigate such a risk, we propose a responsible active learning method,
namely Peer Study Learning (PSL), to simultaneously preserve data privacy and
improve model stability. Specifically, we first introduce a human-in-the-loop
teacher-student architecture to isolate unlabelled data from the task learner
(teacher) on the cloud-side by maintaining an active learner (student) on the
client-side. During training, the task learner instructs the light-weight
active learner which then provides feedback on the active sampling criterion.
To further enhance the active learner via large-scale unlabelled data, we
introduce multiple peer students into the active learner which is trained by a
novel learning paradigm, including the In-Class Peer Study on labelled data and
the Out-of-Class Peer Study on unlabelled data. Lastly, we devise a
discrepancy-based active sampling criterion, Peer Study Feedback, that exploits
the variability of peer students to select the most informative data to improve
model stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed PSL over a wide range of active learning methods in both standard and
sensitive protection settings.

time a tomographic analysis of coupled dark energy, where the coupling strength
is parametrized and constrained in different redshift bins. This allows us to
verify which data can better constrain the strength of the coupling and how
large the coupling can be at different epochs. First, we employ cosmic
microwave background data from Planck, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)
and South Pole Telescope (SPT), showing the impact of different choices that
can be done in combining these datasets. Then, we use a range of low redshift
probes to test CDE cosmologies, both for a constant and for a tomographic
coupling. In particular, we use for the first time data from weak lensing (the
KiDS-1000 survey), galaxy clustering (BOSS survey), and their combination,
including 3x2pt galaxy-galaxy lensing cross-correlation data. We do not find
evidence for nonzero coupling, either for a constant or tomographic case. A
nonzero coupling is however still in agreement with current data. For CMB and
background datasets, a tomographic coupling allows for $\beta$ values up to one
order of magnitude larger than in previous works, in particular at $z<1$. The
use of 3x2pt analysis then becomes important to constrain $\beta$ at low
redshifts, even when coupling is allowed to vary: for 3x2pt we find, at $0.5 <
z < 1$, $\beta=0.0180_{-0.011}^{+0.007}$, comparable to what CMB and background
datasets would give for a constant coupling. This makes upcoming galaxy surveys
potentially powerful probes to test CDE models at low redshifts. (abridged)

field are set as inputs of the method and are arbitrarily chosen by the user.
In order to evaluate the validity domain of COVMOS at the level of the produced
two-point statistics covariance matrix, we choose to target these two input
statistical quantities from realistic $N$-body simulation outputs. In
particular, we perform this cloning procedure in a $\Lambda$CDM and in a
massive neutrino cosmologies, for five redshifts in the range $z\in[0,2]$.
First, we validate the output real-space two-point statistics (both in
configuration and Fourier space) estimated over $5,000$ COVMOS realisations per
redshift and per cosmology, with a volume of $1\ [\mathrm{Gpc}/h]^3$ and $10^8$
particles each. Such a validation is performed against the corresponding
$N$-body measurements, estimated from 50 simulations. We find the method to be
valid up to $k\sim 0.2h/$Mpc for the power spectrum and down to $r~\sim 20$
Mpc$/h$ for the correlation function. Then, we extend the method by proposing a
new modelling of the peculiar velocity distribution, aiming at reproducing the
redshift-space distortions both in the linear and mildly non-linear regimes.
After validating this prescription, we finally compare and validate the
produced redshift-space two-point statistics covariance matrices in the same
range of scales. We release on a public repository the Python code associated
with this method, allowing the production of tens of thousands of realisations
in record time. COVMOS is intended for any user involved in large galaxy-survey

  Methods: We developed a lens-free approach for constructing dual-color
head-mounted, fiber-based optical units: any two wavelengths can be combined.
  Results: Here, each unit was comprised of one 450 nm and one 638 nm laser
diode, yielding light power of 0.4 mW and 8 mW at the end of a 50 micrometer
multimode fiber. To create a multi-color/multi-site optoelectronic device, a

  Conclusion: Using these devices, the same cortical PV cell could be activated

is crucial for yield optimization and process stability. Yet, in situ
temperature measurements with spatial and temporal resolution are still
challenging. In this work, we perform temperature measurements in a cylindrical
fixed bed reactor by combining the capabilities of real-time magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) with the temperature-dependent proton resonance frequency (PRF)
shift of water. Three-dimensional (3D) temperature maps are acquired while
heating the bed from room temperature to 60~$^{\circ}$C using hot air. The
obtained results show a clear temperature gradient along the axial and radial
dimensions and agree with optical temperature probe measurements with an
average error of $\pm$ 1.5~$^{\circ}$C. We believe that the MR thermometry
methodology presented here opens new perspectives for the fundamental study of
mass and heat transfer in gas-solid fixed beds and in the future might be
extended to the study of reactive gas-solid systems.

appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low
probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to
such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable
under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from

for ultralight bosonic dark matter (DM), such as the axion, can be used to
determine whether it is in a coherent or incoherent quantum state. The example
is essentially trivial, but I hope that explicitly addressing it provokes
experimental exploration. In the standard coherent state, $\mathcal{O}(1)$
oscillations in the number density occur over the coherence time, $\tau_c=h/m
v^2$, where $m$ is the particle mass and $v$ is the galactic virial velocity,
leading to a reduction in the constraining power of experiments operating on
timescales $T<\tau_c$, due to the unknown global phase. On the other hand if
the DM is incoherent then no such strong number oscillations occur, since the
ensemble average over particles in different streams gives an effective phase
average. If an experiment detects a signal then the coherent or incoherent
nature of DM can be determined by time series analysis over the coherence time.
This finding is observationally relevant for DM masses, $10^{-17}\text{
eV}\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{-11}\text{ eV}$ (corresponding to coherence times
between a year and 100 seconds), and can be explored by experiments including
CASPEr, DMRadio, and AION. Coherence may also be measurable at higher masses in

a magnifying glass improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors to
distant events. A point mass lens between the detector and the source can
manifest itself either through an amplification of the gravitational wave
signal in a frequency dependent manner that is maximum at merger or through
magnification combined with the appearance of a second image that interferes
with the first creating a regular, predictable pattern. We map the increase in
the signal to noise ratio for upcoming LVK observations as a function of the
mass of the lens $M_L$ and dimensionless source position y for any point mass
lens between the detector and the binary source. We find that most microlensing
is silent with mismatch under $10\%$ and may never be identified as lensed. To
quantify detectability, we compute the optimal match between the lensed
waveform and the waveforms in the unlensed template bank and provide a map of
the match. The higher the mismatch with unlensed templates, the more detectable
lensing is. Furthermore, we estimate the probability of lensing, and find that
the redshift to which binary mergers are visible with the LVK increases from $z
\approx 1$ to $z\approx 3.2$ for a total detected mass $M_{det} = 120 M_\odot$.
The overall probability of lensing is $<20\%$ of all detectable events above
the threshold SNR for $M_{det} = 120 M_\odot$ and $<5\%$ for more common events
with $M_{det} = 60 M_\odot$. We find that there is a selection bias for
detectable lensing that favors events that are close to the line of sight $y
\lesssim 0.5$. Black hole binary searches could thus improve their sensitivity
by introducing a prior that takes the bias into account.

two-stage estimation procedure, consisting of a directional binned Weibull
parameter estimation, followed by a harmonic regression to estimate the
dependence of the Weibull parameters on wind direction. A Monte Carlo

the spectrum comprises of three bands, including a flat band. The bands are
systematically deformed with an aim to study the evolution of topology and the
transport properties. The deformations are induced through hopping anisotropies
and are achieved in two distinct ways. In one of them, the hopping amplitudes
between the sites of B and C sublattices and those between A and B sublattices
are varied along a particular direction, and in the other, the hopping between
the sites of A and B sublattices are varied (keeping B-C hopping unaltered)
along the same direction. The first case retains some of the spectral features
of the familiar dice lattice and yields Chern insulating lobes in the phase
diagram with $C=\pm2$ till a certain critical deformation. The topological
features are supported by the presence of a pair of chiral edge modes at each
edge of a ribbon and the plateaus observed in the anomalous Hall conductivity
support the above scenario. Whereas, a selective tuning of only the A-B hopping
amplitudes distorts the flat band and has important ramifications on the
topological properties of the system. The insulating lobes in the phase diagram
have distinct features compared to the case above, and there are dips observed
in the Hall conductivity near the zero bias. The dip widens as the hopping
anisotropy is made larger, and thus the scenario registers significant
deviation from the familiar plateau structure observed in the anomalous Hall
conductivity. However, a phase transition from a topological to a trivial
insulating region demonstrated by the Chern number changing discontinuously
from $\pm2$ to zero beyond a certain critical hopping anisotropy remains a
common feature in the two cases.

galaxies at redshift $z\simeq6$ using the $JWST$/NIRCam imaging data. These
galaxies, with a wide range of Ly$\alpha$ luminosities, were recently observed
in a series of NIRCam broad- and medium-bands. We constrain the rest-frame
UV/optical continua and measure the H$\alpha$ line emission of the galaxies
using the combination of the $JWST$/NIRCam and archival $HST$/WFC3 infrared
photometry. We further estimate their escape fractions of Ly$\alpha$ photons
($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$) and the production efficiency of ionizing
photons ($\xi_{\rm ion}$). Among the sample, 6/7 galaxies have Ly$\alpha$
escape fractions of ${\lesssim}10\%$, which might be the status for most of
star-forming galaxies at $z\simeq6$. One UV-faint Ly$\alpha$ galaxy with an
extremely blue UV slope owns a large value of $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$
reaching ${\simeq}50\%$. These galaxies spread a broad range of $\xi_{\rm ion}$
over log$_{10}$ $\xi_{\rm ion, 0}$ (Hz erg$^{-1}$) $\sim25.0-26.5$. We find
that UV-fainter galaxies with bluer UV continuum slopes likely have higher
escape fractions of Ly$\alpha$ photons. We also find that galaxies with higher
Ly$\alpha$ line emission tend to produce ionizing photons more efficiently. The
most Ly$\alpha$-luminous galaxy in the sample has a very high $\xi_{\rm ion,
0}$ of log$_{10}$ $\xi_{\rm ion, 0}$ (Hz erg$^{-1}$) $>26$. Our results support
that Ly$\alpha$ galaxies may have served as an important contributor to the
cosmic reionization. Blue and bright Ly$\alpha$ galaxies are excellent targets
for $JWST$ follow-up spectroscopic observations.

(H&E) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an essential part of the pathologic
assessment of surgically resected breast cancer specimens. IHC staining has
been broadly adopted into diagnostic guidelines and routine workflows to
manually assess status and scoring of several established biomarkers, including
ER, PGR, HER2 and KI67. However, this is a task that can also be facilitated by
computational pathology image analysis methods. The research in computational
pathology has recently made numerous substantial advances, often based on
publicly available whole slide image (WSI) data sets. However, the field is
still considerably limited by the sparsity of public data sets. In particular,
there are no large, high quality publicly available data sets with WSIs of
matching IHC and H&E-stained tissue sections. Here, we publish the currently
largest publicly available data set of WSIs of tissue sections from surgical
resection specimens from female primary breast cancer patients with matched
WSIs of corresponding H&E and IHC-stained tissue, consisting of 4,212 WSIs from
1,153 patients. The primary purpose of the data set was to facilitate the
ACROBAT WSI registration challenge, aiming at accurately aligning H&E and IHC
images. For research in the area of image registration, automatic quantitative
feedback on registration algorithm performance remains available through the
ACROBAT challenge website, based on more than 37,000 manually annotated
landmark pairs from 13 annotators. Beyond registration, this data set has the
potential to enable many different avenues of computational pathology research,
including stain-guided learning, virtual staining, unsupervised pre-training,
artefact detection and stain-independent models.

follows. A token is placed on a vertex of a graph, and the two players move it
to produce an infinite ""play"", which determines the winner or payoff of the
game. Traditionally, the players alternate turns in moving the token. In
""bidding games"", however, the players have budgets and in each turn, an auction
(bidding) determines which player moves the token. So far, bidding games have
only been studied as full-information games. In this work we initiate the study
of partial-information bidding games: we study bidding games in which a
player's initial budget is drawn from a known probability distribution. We show
that while for some bidding mechanisms and objectives, it is straightforward to
adapt the results from the full-information setting to the partial-information
setting, for others, the analysis is significantly more challenging, requires
new techniques, and gives rise to interesting results. Specifically, we study
games with ""mean-payoff"" objectives in combination with ""poorman"" bidding. We
construct optimal strategies for a partially-informed player who plays against
a fully-informed adversary. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, the ""value""

in one of two states, either 0 or 1. In each time step, each node adopts the
state of a randomly sampled neighbor according to sampling probabilities,
referred to as node interaction parameters. We study the maximum likelihood
estimation of the node interaction parameters from observed node states for a
given number of realizations of the voter model process. In contrast to
previous work on parameter estimation of network autoregressive processes,
whose long-run behavior is according to a stationary stochastic process, the
voter model is an absorbing stochastic process that eventually reaches a
consensus state. This requires developing a framework for deriving parameter
estimation error bounds from observations consisting of several realizations of
a voter model process. We present parameter estimation error bounds by
interpreting the observation data as being generated according to an extended
voter process that consists of cycles, each corresponding to a realization of
the voter model process until absorption to a consensus state. In order to
obtain these results, consensus time of a voter model process plays an
important role. We present new bounds for all moments and a bound that holds
with any given probability for consensus time, which may be of independent
interest. In contrast to most existing work, our results yield a consensus time
bound that holds with high probability. We also present a sampling complexity
lower bound for parameter estimation within a prescribed error tolerance for
the class of locally stable estimators.

corresponding to observational data with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA). The Deep Solar ALMA Neural Network
Estimator (Deep-SANNE) is an artificial neural network trained to improve the

dynamic patterns in both the spatial and temporal domains of small-scale
features at an angular resolution corresponding to observational data and
correlated them to highly resolved nondegraded data from the
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. A second simulation, was used to validate the
performance. Deep-SANNE provides maps of the estimated degradation of the
brightness temperature, which can be used to filter for locations that most
probably show a high accuracy and as correction factors in order to construct
refined images that show higher contrast and more accurate brightness
temperatures than at the observational resolution. Deep-SANNE reveals more
small-scale features and estimates the excess temperature of brightening events
with an average accuracy of 94.0% relative to the highly resolved data,
compared to 43.7% at the observational resolution. By using the additional
information of the temporal domain, Deep-SANNE can restore high contrasts
better than a standard two-dimensional deconvolver technique. Deep-SANNE is
applied on observational solar ALMA data. The Deep-SANNE refined images are

IRAS 19312+1950 is an isolated infrared source that exhibits a
characteristic quasi-point-symmetric morphology in the near- and mid-infrared
images and is also very bright in molecular radio lines. Because of its unique
observational characteristics, various observational studies have been
conducted and several hypotheses have been proposed regarding its origin, which
is still unclear. So far, it has been suggested that it could be a peculiar
evolved star, a young stellar object, or even a red nova remnant. Regardless of
which type of object it is ultimately classified as, IRAS 19312+1950 is
exceptionally bright in the infrared and molecular radio lines and therefore
will undoubtedly be crucial as a prototype of this kind of object having a
peculiar nature or unusual evolutionary phase.
  Aims. This study aims to reveal the molecular composition of the central part
of IRAS 19312+1950 by performing an unbiased molecular radio line survey and
discussing the origin of the object from a molecular chemical point of view.
  Methods. We carried out a spectral line survey with the IRAM 30 m telescope
towards the center of IRAS 19312+1950 in the 3 and 1.3 mm windows.
  Results. In total, 28 transition lines of 22 molecular species and those
isotopologues are detected towards IRAS 19312+1950, some of which exhibit a
broad and a narrow components. Seventeen thermal lines and 1 maser line are
newly detected. The molecular species of C$^{17}$O, $^{30}$SiO, HN$^{13}$C,
HC$^{18}$O$^{+}$, H$_{2}$CO, and $c$-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ are detected for the first
time in this object.
  Conclusions. Our results, in combination with previous studies, favor the
hypothesis that IRAS 19312+1950 might be a red nova remnant, in which the
progenitors that merged to become a red nova may have contained at least two
evolved stars with oxygen-rich and carbon-rich chemistry, respectively.

that quantum mechanics cannot be completely described by local realistic

imperfect entanglement source and low detection efficiency, the original
Hardy's paradox may induce a rather small Hardy violation and only be realized
by expensive quantum systems. To overcome this problem, we propose a realigned
Hardy's paradox. Compared with the original version of Hardy's paradox, the
realigned Hardy's paradox can dramatically improve the Hardy violation. Then,
we generalize the realigned Hardy's paradox to arbitrary even $n$ dichotomic
measurements. For $n=2$ and $n=4$ cases, the realigned Hardy's paradox can
achieve Hardy values $P(00|A_1B_1)$ approximate $0.4140$ and $0.7734$
respectively compared with $0.09$ of the original Hardy's paradox. Meanwhile,
the structure of the realigned Hardy's paradox is simpler and more robust in
the sense that there is only one Hardy condition rather than three conditions.
One can anticipate that the realigned Hardy's paradox can tolerate more
experimental imperfections and stimulate more fascinating quantum information
applications.

this, we consider a Rydberg atom interacting with a single ground state atom
and an ion. The additional atom breaks the system's cylindrical symmetry, which
leads to mixing between states that would otherwise be decoupled. The
electronic structure is obtained using exact diagonalisation over a finite

Time-Dependent Hartree method. Due to the lobe-like structure of the electronic
density, bound trimers with both linear and nonlinear geometrical

computer vision models obtained illegitimately from their owners, however they
fail to demonstrate satisfactory robustness against model extraction attacks.
In this paper, we present an adaptive framework to watermark a protected model,
leveraging the unique behavior present in the model due to a unique random seed
initialized during the model training. This watermark is used to detect
extracted models, which have the same unique behavior, indicating an
unauthorized usage of the protected model's intellectual property (IP). First,
we show how an initial seed for random number generation as part of model
training produces distinct characteristics in the model's decision boundaries,
which are inherited by extracted models and present in their decision
boundaries, but aren't present in non-extracted models trained on the same
data-set with a different seed. Based on our findings, we suggest the Robust
Adaptive Watermarking (RAW) Framework, which utilizes the unique behavior
present in the protected and extracted models to generate a watermark key-set
and verification model. We show that the framework is robust to (1) unseen
model extraction attacks, and (2) extracted models which undergo a blurring
method (e.g., weight pruning). We evaluate the framework's robustness against a
naive attacker (unaware that the model is watermarked), and an informed
attacker (who employs blurring strategies to remove watermarked behavior from
an extracted model), and achieve outstanding (i.e., >0.9) AUC values. Finally,
we show that the framework is robust to model extraction attacks with different

these degeneracies bias the retrieval of other parameters even at maximal

numerous astrophysical phenomena associated with binary neutron-star mergers,
such as mass ejection and the powering of short gamma-ray bursts. Magnetic
fields in isolated neutron stars are often assumed to be confined to a small
region near the stellar surface, while they are normally taken to fill the
whole stars in the numerical modelling. By performing high-resolution, global,
and high-order general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations we
investigate the impact of a purely crustal magnetic field and contrast it with
the standard configuration consisting of a dipolar magnetic field with the same
magnetic energy but filling the whole star. While the crust-configurations are
very effective in generating strong magnetic fields during the
Kelvin-Helmholtz-instability stage, they fail to achieve the same level of
magnetic-field amplification of the full-star configurations. This is due to
the lack of magnetized material in the neutron-star interiors to be used for
further turbulent amplification and to the surface losses of highly magnetized
matter in the crust-configurations. Hence, the final magnetic energies in the
two configurations differ by more than one order of magnitude. We briefly
discuss the impact of these results on astrophysical observables and how they
can be employed to deduce the magnetic topology in merging binaries.

appending target domain data is insufficient training datasets during the
training phase. Therefore, conventional deep learning and transfer learning
classifiers are not applicable especially when individual classes are not
represented or are severely underrepresented at the outset. In many technical
domains, however, it is only the defect or worn reject classes that are
insufficiently represented, while the non-defect class is often available from
the beginning. The proposed classification approach addresses such conditions
and is based on a CNN encoder. Following a contrastive learning approach, it is
trained with a modified triplet loss function using two datasets: Besides the
non-defective target domain class 1st dataset, a state-of-the-art labeled
source domain dataset that contains highly related classes e.g., a related
manufacturing error or wear defect but originates from a highly different
domain e.g., different product, material, or appearance = 2nd dataset is
utilized. The approach learns the classification features from the source
domain dataset while at the same time learning the differences between the
source and the target domain in a single training step, aiming to transfer the
relevant features to the target domain. The classifier becomes sensitive to the
classification features and by architecture robust against the highly
domain-specific context. The approach is benchmarked in a technical and a
non-technical domain and shows convincing classification results. In
particular, it is shown that the domain generalization capabilities and
classification results are improved by the proposed architecture, allowing for
larger domain shifts between source and target domains.

collected on two Mediterranean blue tit subspecies (Cyanistes caeruleus
caeruleus and C.c. ogliastrae) to explore whether blue crown and yellow breast
patch colourations have changed over the past 15 years. Our data suggests that
colouration has become duller and less chromatic in both sexes. In addition, in
the Corsican C.c. ogliastrae, but not in the mainland C.c. caeruleus, the
decrease is associated with an increase in temperature at moult. Quantitative
genetic analyses do not reveal any microevolutionary change in the colour
traits along the study period, strongly suggesting that the observed change
over time was caused by a plastic response to the environmental conditions.
Overall, this study suggests that ornamental colourations could become less
conspicuous due to warming, revealing climate change effects on sexual and

trained with distortion-oriented losses, such as L1 or L2. However, it has been
shown that using a single perceptual loss is insufficient for accurately
restoring locally varying diverse shapes in images, often generating
undesirable artifacts or unnatural details. For this reason, combinations of
various losses, such as perceptual, adversarial, and distortion losses, have
been attempted, yet it remains challenging to find optimal combinations. Hence,
in this paper, we propose a new SISR framework that applies optimal objectives
for each region to generate plausible results in overall areas of
high-resolution outputs. Specifically, the framework comprises two models: a
predictive model that infers an optimal objective map for a given
low-resolution (LR) input and a generative model that applies a target
objective map to produce the corresponding SR output. The generative model is
trained over our proposed objective trajectory representing a set of essential
objectives, which enables the single network to learn various SR results
corresponding to combined losses on the trajectory. The predictive model is
trained using pairs of LR images and corresponding optimal objective maps
searched from the objective trajectory. Experimental results on five benchmarks
show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art perception-driven SR
methods in LPIPS, DISTS, PSNR, and SSIM metrics. The visual results also

black holes (SMBHs) grow mostly through non-merger (`secular') processes. Since
galaxy mergers lead to dynamical bulge growth, the only way to observationally
isolate non-merger growth is to study galaxies with low bulge-to-total mass
ratio (e.g. B/T < 10%). However, bulge growth can also occur due to secular
processes, such as disk instabilities, making disk-dominated selections a
somewhat incomplete way to select merger-free systems. Here we use the
Horizon-AGN simulation to select simulated galaxies which have not undergone a
merger since z = 2, regardless of bulge mass, and investigate their location on
typical black hole-galaxy scaling relations in comparison to galaxies with
merger dominated histories. While the existence of these correlations has long
been interpreted as co-evolution of galaxies and their SMBHs driven by galaxy
mergers, we show here that they persist even in the absence of mergers. We find
that the correlations between SMBH mass and both total mass and stellar
velocity dispersion are independent of B/T ratio for both merger-free and
merger-dominated galaxies. In addition, the bulge mass and SMBH mass
correlation is still apparent for merger-free galaxies, the intercept for which
is dependent on B/T. Galaxy mergers reduce the scatter around the scaling
relations, with merger-free systems showing broader scatter. We show that for
merger-free galaxies, the co-evolution is dominated by radio-mode feedback, and
suggest that the long periods of time between galaxy mergers make an important
contribution to the co-evolution between galaxies and SMBHs in all galaxies.

photoacoustic microscopy suffers from limited depth of field due to the
strongly focused laser beam. In this work, a 3D information fusion algorithm
based on 3D stationary wavelet transform and joint weighted evaluation
optimization is proposed to fuse multi-focus photoacoustic data to achieve
large-volumetric and high-resolution 3D imaging. First, a three-dimensional
stationary wavelet transform was performed on the multi-focus data to obtain
eight wavelet coefficients. Differential evolution algorithm based on joint
weighted evaluation was then employed to optimize the block size of division
for each wavelet coefficient. Corresponding sub-coefficients of multi-focus 3D
data were fused with the proposed fusion rule utilizing standard deviation for
focus detection. Finally, photoacoustic microscopy with large depth of field
can be achieved by applying the inverse stationary wavelet transform on the 8
fused sub-coefficients. The fusion result of multi-focus vertically tilted
fiber shows that the depth of field of optical-resolution photoacoustic
microscopy is doubled without sacrificing lateral resolution via the proposed
method. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified

quality standard and environmental protection, or negative consequences from
loan, guarantee and pledge contracts, may result in operating and credit risks
of firms. The above illegal or trust-breaking activities are collectively
called discreditable activities, and firms with discreditable activities are
named as discreditable firms. Identification of discreditable firms is of great
significance for investment attraction, bank lending, equity investment,
supplier selection, job seeking, and so on. In this paper, we collect
registration records of about 113 million Chinese firms and construct an
ownership network with about 6 million nodes, where each node is a firm who has
invested at least one firm or has been invested by at least one firm. Analysis
of publicly available records of discreditable activities show strong network
effect, namely the probability of a firm to be discreditable is remarkably
higher than the average probability given the fact that one of its investors or
investees is discreditable. In comparison, for the risk of being a
discreditable firm, an investee has higher impact than an investor in average.
The impact of a firm on surrounding firms decays along with the increasing
topological distance, analogous to the well-known ""three degrees of separation""
phenomenon. The uncovered correlation of discreditable activities can be
considered as a representative example of network effect, in addition to the
propagation of diseases, opinions and human behaviors. Lastly, we show that the
utilization of the network effect largely improves the accuracy of the
algorithm to identify discreditable firms.

buffers to expand the matching space of detections and tracks, which mitigates
the effect of irregular motions in two aspects: one is to directly match
identical but non-overlapping detections and tracks in adjacent frames, and the
other is to compensate for the motion estimation bias in the matching space. In
addition, to reduce the risk of overexpansion of the matching space, cascaded
matching is employed: first matching alive tracks and detections with a small
buffer, and then matching unmatched tracks and detections with a large buffer.
Despite its simplicity, our C-BIoU tracker works surprisingly well and achieves
state-of-the-art results on MOT datasets that focus on irregular motions and
indistinguishable appearances. Moreover, the C-BIoU tracker is the dominant

theories composed of at most second-time derivatives. Indeed, it is not often
we need to take the time derivative of the acceleration. So why are we not
seeing more higher-order derivative theories? Although several studies present
higher derivatives usefulness in quadratic gravity and scalar-field theories,
one will eventually encounter a problem. In 1850, the physicist Mikhail
Ostrogradsky presented a theorem that stated that a non-degenerate Lagrangian
composed of finite higher-order time derivatives results in a Hamiltonian
unbounded from below. Explicitly, it was shown that the Hamiltonian of such a
system includes linearity in physical momenta, often referred to as the
Ostrogradsky ghost. This thesis studies how one can avoid the Ostrogradsky
ghost by considering degenerate Lagrangians to put constraints on the momenta.
The study begins by showing the existence of the ghost and later cover the
essential Hamiltonian formalism needed to conduct Hamiltonian constraint
analyses of second-order time derivative systems, both single-variable and
systems coupled to a regular one. Ultimately, the degenerate second-order
Lagrangians successfully eliminate the Ostrogradsky ghost by generating
secondary constraints restricting the physical momenta. Moreover, an outline of
a Hamiltonian analysis of a general higher-order Lagrangian is presented at the
end.

asymptotically optimal performances expressed by the regret in repeated games.
We model such an incentive-aware recommender system as a multi-agent bandit
problem in a two-sided market which is equipped with an incentive constraint
induced by agents' opportunity costs. If the opportunity costs are known to the
principal, we show that there exists an incentive-compatible recommendation
policy, which pools recommendations across a genuinely good arm and an unknown
arm via a randomized and adaptive approach. On the other hand, if the
opportunity costs are unknown to the principal, we propose a policy that
randomly pools recommendations across all arms and uses each arm's cumulative

  differentiation, the adjoint method and accelerated linear algebra",,,,,"cs.MS cs.CE math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Shape optimization is of great significance in structural engineering, as an
efficient geometry leads to better performance of structures. However, the
application of gradient-based shape optimization for structural and
architectural design is limited, which is partly due to the difficulty and the
complexity in gradient evaluation. In this work, an efficient framework based
on automatic differentiation (AD), the adjoint method and accelerated linear
algebra (XLA) is proposed to promote the implementation of gradient-based shape
optimization. The framework is realized by the implementation of the
high-performance computing (HPC) library JAX. We leverage AD for gradient
evaluation in the sensitivity analysis stage. Compared to numerical
differentiation, AD is more accurate; compared to analytical and symbolic
differentiation, AD is more efficient and easier to apply. In addition, the
adjoint method is used to reduce the complexity of computation of the
sensitivity. The XLA feature is exploited by an efficient programming
architecture that we proposed, which can boost gradient evaluation. The
proposed framework also supports hardware acceleration such as GPUs. The
framework is applied to the form finding of arches and different free-form
gridshells: gridshell inspired by Mannheim Multihalle, four-point supported
gridshell, and canopy-like structures. Two geometric descriptive methods are
used: non-parametric and parametric description via B\'ezier surface.
Non-constrained and constrained shape optimization problems are considered,
where the former is solved by gradient descent and the latter is solved by
sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Through these examples, the proposed
framework is shown to be able to provide structural engineers with a more
efficient tool for shape optimization, enabling better design for the built
environment.

satisfying a bounded differential privacy (DP) guarantee. This task has been
understudied in machine learning literature despite its prevalence in many
domains such as healthcare. We propose three new DP multi-winner mechanisms:
Binary, $\tau$, and Powerset voting. Binary voting operates independently per
label through composition. $\tau$ voting bounds votes optimally in their
$\ell_2$ norm for tight data-independent guarantees. Powerset voting operates
over the entire binary vector by viewing the possible outcomes as a power set.
Our theoretical and empirical analysis shows that Binary voting can be a
competitive mechanism on many tasks unless there are strong correlations
between labels, in which case Powerset voting outperforms it. We use our
mechanisms to enable privacy-preserving multi-label learning in the central
setting by extending the canonical single-label technique: PATE. We find that
our techniques outperform current state-of-the-art approaches on large,
real-world healthcare data and standard multi-label benchmarks. We further
enable multi-label confidential and private collaborative (CaPC) learning and
show that model performance can be significantly improved in the multi-site

developed for rapidly and accurately estimating the HOMO and LUMO energies of a

DAMO-YOLO, which achieves higher performance than the state-of-the-art YOLO
series. DAMO-YOLO is extended from YOLO with some new technologies, including
Neural Architecture Search (NAS), efficient Reparameterized Generalized-FPN
(RepGFPN), a lightweight head with AlignedOTA label assignment, and
distillation enhancement. In particular, we use MAE-NAS, a method guided by the
principle of maximum entropy, to search our detection backbone under the
constraints of low latency and high performance, producing ResNet/CSP-like
structures with spatial pyramid pooling and focus modules. In the design of
necks and heads, we follow the rule of ``large neck, small head''.We import
Generalized-FPN with accelerated queen-fusion to build the detector neck and
upgrade its CSPNet with efficient layer aggregation networks (ELAN) and
reparameterization. Then we investigate how detector head size affects
detection performance and find that a heavy neck with only one task projection
layer would yield better results.In addition, AlignedOTA is proposed to solve
the misalignment problem in label assignment. And a distillation schema is
introduced to improve performance to a higher level. Based on these new techs,
we build a suite of models at various scales to meet the needs of different
scenarios. For general industry requirements, we propose DAMO-YOLO-T/S/M/L.
They can achieve 43.6/47.7/50.2/51.9 mAPs on COCO with the latency of
2.78/3.83/5.62/7.95 ms on T4 GPUs respectively. Additionally, for edge devices

using a simple continuous time stochastic model, which separates the effects of
mobility, savings, labor income, rates of return, demography, inheritance, and
assortative mating. Based on two results from stochastic calculus, I show that
this decomposition is nonparametrically identified and can be estimated based
solely on repeated cross-sections of the data. I estimate it in the United
States since 1962 using historical data on income, wealth, and demography. I
find that the main drivers of the rise of the top 1% wealth share since the
1980s have been, in decreasing level of importance, higher savings at the top,
higher rates of return on wealth (essentially in the form of capital gains),
and higher labor income inequality. I then use the model to study the effects
of wealth taxation. I derive simple formulas for how the tax base reacts to the
net-of-tax rate in the long run, which nest insights from several existing
models, and can be calibrated using estimable elasticities. In the benchmark
calibration, the revenue-maximizing wealth tax rate at the top is high (around
12%), but the revenue collected from the tax is much lower than in the static

learning shortcuts - features in the data that are predictive but unrelated to
the problem at hand. To address this issue for datasets where the shortcuts are
smaller and more localized than true features, we propose a novel approach to
detect and remove them. We use an adversarially trained lens to detect and
eliminate highly predictive but semantically unconnected clues in images. In
our experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that our
proposed approach reliably identifies and neutralizes such shortcuts without
causing degradation of model performance on clean data. We believe that our
approach can lead to more meaningful and generalizable machine learning models,

issues in the supply chain and concerns about food shortage drove up the food
prices. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the prices for food
increased 4.1% and 3.7% over the year ended in August 2020 and August 2021,
respectively, while the amount of annual increase in the food prices prior to
the COVID-19 pandemic is less than 2.0%. Previous studies show that such kinds
of exogenous disasters, including the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, 9/11 terrorist
attacks, and major infectious diseases, and the resulted unusual food prices
often led to subsequent changes in people's consumption behaviors. We
hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic causes food price changes and the price
changes alter people's grocery shopping behaviors as well. To thoroughly
explore this, we formulate our analysis from two different perspectives, by
collecting data both globally, from China, Japan, United Kingdom, and United
States, and locally, from different groups of people inside the US. In
particular, we analyze the trends between food prices and COVID-19 as well as
between food prices and spending, aiming to find out their correlations and the
lessons for preparing the next pandemic.

technique for such regional control in T2I generation. We augment T2I models'

described by open-ended regional texts rather than by object labels from a
constrained category set. Empirically, ReCo achieves better image quality than
the T2I model strengthened by positional words (FID: 8.82->7.36, SceneFID:
15.54->6.51 on COCO), together with objects being more accurately placed,
amounting to a 20.40% region classification accuracy improvement on COCO.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReCo can better control the object count,
spatial relationship, and region attributes such as color/size, with the
free-form regional description. Human evaluation on PaintSkill shows that ReCo
is +19.28% and +17.21% more accurate in generating images with correct object
count and spatial relationship than the T2I model.

from quadric to linear. Among them, the low-rank-based methods aim to learn the
projection matrices to compress the sequence length. However, the projection
matrices are fixed once they have been learned, which compress sequence length
with dedicated coefficients for tokens in the same position. Adopting such
input-invariant projections ignores the fact that the most informative part of
a sequence varies from sequence to sequence, thus failing to preserve the most
useful information that lies in varied positions. In addition, previous
efficient Transformers only focus on the influence of sequence length while
neglecting the effect of hidden state dimension. To address the aforementioned
problems, we present an efficient yet effective attention mechanism, namely the
Dynamic Bilinear Low-Rank Attention (DBA), which compresses the sequence length
by input-sensitive dynamic projection matrices and achieves linear time and
space complexity by jointly optimizing the sequence length and hidden state
dimension while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we
first theoretically demonstrate that the sequence length can be compressed
non-destructively from a novel perspective of information theory, with
compression matrices dynamically determined by the input sequence. Furthermore,
we show that the hidden state dimension can be approximated by extending the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, optimizing the attention in bilinear form.
Theoretical analysis shows that DBA is proficient in capturing high-order
relations in cross-attention problems. Experiments over tasks with diverse
sequence length conditions show that DBA achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared with various strong baselines while maintaining less memory
consumption with higher speed.

characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions: harmonic measure density and
mean first-passage time. First, we compute the volume-averaged harmonic measure
density on prolate and oblate spheroidal targets inside a confining domain in
three dimensions. This allows us to quantify the uniformity of this density in
the small target limit. Second, we derive an explicit expression of the mean
first-passage time to such targets and analyze the effect of anisotropy. In
particular, we illustrate the accuracy of the capacitance approximation for
small targets.

  Disease Patients Based on Insoles","8 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  During the preceding decades, human gait analysis has been the center of
attention for the scientific community, while the association between gait
analysis and overall health monitoring has been extensively reported.
Technological advances further assisted in this alignment, resulting in access
to inexpensive and remote healthcare services. Various assessment tools, such
as software platforms and mobile applications, have been proposed by the
scientific community and the market that employ sensors to monitor human gait
for various purposes ranging from biomechanics to the progression of functional
recovery. The framework presented herein offers a valuable digital biomarker
for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease that can help clinical
experts in the decision-making process leading to corrective planning or
patient-specific treatment. More accurate and reliable decisions can be
provided through a wide variety of integrated Artificial Intelligence
algorithms and straightforward visualization techniques, including, but not
limited to, heatmaps and bar plots. The framework consists of three core
components: the insole pair, the mobile application, and the cloud-based
platform. The insole pair deploys 16 plantar pressure sensors, an
accelerometer, and a gyroscope to acquire gait data. The mobile application
formulates the data for the cloud platform, which orchestrates the component
interaction through the web application. Utilizing open communication protocols
enables the straightforward replacement of one of the core components with a
relative one (e.g., a different model of insoles), transparently from the end
user, without affecting the overall architecture, resulting in a framework with
the flexibility to adjust its modularity.

decoding electroencephalogram signals. In subject-independent brain-computer
interface system, domain adaption and generalization are utilized to shift
source subjects' data distribution to match the target subject as an
augmentation. However, previous works either introduce noises (e.g., by noise
addition or generation with random noises) or modify target data, thus, cannot
well depict the target data distribution and hinder further analysis. In this
paper, we propose a target-centered subject transfer framework as a data
augmentation approach. A subset of source data is first constructed to maximize
the source-target relevance. Then, the generative model is applied to transfer
the data to target domain. The proposed framework enriches the explainability
of target domain by adding extra real data, instead of noises. It shows
superior performance compared with other data augmentation methods. Extensive
experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach as a prosperous tool for further research.

  nonlinear chemo-mechanics problems",,,,"Preprint 2022-02","math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the swelling of hydrogels as an example of a chemo-mechanical
problem with strong coupling between the mechanical balance relations and the
mass diffusion. The problem is cast into a minimization formulation using a
time-explicit approach for the dependency of the dissipation potential on the
deformation and the swelling volume fraction to obtain symmetric matrices,
which are typically better suited for iterative solvers. The MPI-parallel
implementation uses the software libraries deal.II, p4est and FROSch (Fast of
Robust Overlapping Schwarz). FROSch is part of the Trilinos library and is used
in fully algebraic mode, i.e., the preconditioner is constructed from the
monolithic system matrix without making explicit use of the problem structure.
Strong and weak parallel scalability is studied using up to 512 cores,
considering the standard GDSW (Generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse space
and the newer coarse space with reduced dimension. The FROSch solver is
applicable to the coupled problems within in the range of processor cores
considered here, although numerical scalablity cannot be expected (and is not
observed) for the fully algebraic mode. In our strong scalability study, the
average number of Krylov iterations per Newton iteration is higher by a factor
of up to six compared to a linear elasticity problem. However, making mild use
of the problem structure in the preconditioner, this number can be reduced to a
factor of two and, importantly, also numerical scalability can then be achieved
experimentally. Nevertheless, the fully algebraic mode is still preferable
since a faster time to solution is achieved.

surrounding of an autonomous car using semantic relations, i.e., how different
traffic participants relate in the context of traffic rule based behaviors, is
hardly been considered in previous work. This stems from the fact that these
relations are hard to extract from real-world traffic scenes. In this work, we
model traffic scenes in a form of spatial semantic scene graphs for various
different predictions about the traffic participants, e.g., acceleration and
deceleration. Our learning and inference approach uses Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) and shows that incorporating explicit information about the spatial
semantic relations between traffic participants improves the predicdtion
results. Specifically, the acceleration prediction of traffic participants is
improved by up to 12% compared to the baselines, which do not exploit this
explicit information. Furthermore, by including additional information about
previous scenes, we achieve 73% improvements.

  Historical Artifacts","To be presented at ICMLA 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Historic dress artifacts are a valuable source for human studies. In
particular, they can provide important insights into the social aspects of
their corresponding era. These insights are commonly drawn from garment
pictures as well as the accompanying descriptions and are usually stored in a
standardized and controlled vocabulary that accurately describes garments and
costume items, called the Costume Core Vocabulary. Building an accurate Costume
Core from garment descriptions can be challenging because the historic garment
items are often donated, and the accompanying descriptions can be based on
untrained individuals and use a language common to the period of the items. In
this paper, we present an approach to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
map the free-form text descriptions of the historic items to that of the
controlled vocabulary provided by the Costume Core. Despite the limited
dataset, we were able to train an NLP model based on the Universal Sentence
Encoder to perform this mapping with more than 90% test accuracy for a subset
of the Costume Core vocabulary. We describe our methodology, design choices,
and development of our approach, and show the feasibility of predicting the
Costume Core for unseen descriptions. With more garment descriptions still
being curated to be used for training, we expect to have higher accuracy for
better generalizability.

critical. In clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) and positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging detect abnormal LNs. Despite its low contrast and
variety in nodal size and form, LN segmentation remains a challenging task.
Deep convolutional neural networks frequently segment items in medical
photographs. Most state-of-the-art techniques destroy image's resolution
through pooling and convolution. As a result, the models provide unsatisfactory
results. Keeping the issues in mind, a well-established deep learning technique
UNet was modified using bilinear interpolation and total generalized variation
(TGV) based upsampling strategy to segment and detect mediastinal lymph nodes.
The modified UNet maintains texture discontinuities, selects noisy areas,
searches appropriate balance points through backpropagation, and recreates
image resolution. Collecting CT image data from TCIA, 5-patients, and ELCAP
public dataset, a dataset was prepared with the help of experienced medical
experts. The UNet was trained using those datasets, and three different data
combinations were utilized for testing. Utilizing the proposed approach, the
model achieved 94.8% accuracy, 91.9% Jaccard, 94.1% recall, and 93.1% precision

performed better than others.
