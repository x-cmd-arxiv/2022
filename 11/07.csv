control tasks, the ""black-box"" nature of an agent has received increasing
concerns. We propose a prototype-based post-hoc policy explainer, ProtoX, that
explains a blackbox agent by prototyping the agent's behaviors into scenarios,
each represented by a prototypical state. When learning prototypes, ProtoX
considers both visual similarity and scenario similarity. The latter is unique
to the reinforcement learning context, since it explains why the same action is
taken in visually different states. To teach ProtoX about visual similarity, we
pre-train an encoder using contrastive learning via self-supervised learning to
recognize states as similar if they occur close together in time and receive
the same action from the black-box agent. We then add an isometry layer to
allow ProtoX to adapt scenario similarity to the downstream task. ProtoX is
trained via imitation learning using behavior cloning, and thus requires no
access to the environment or agent. In addition to explanation fidelity, we
design different prototype shaping terms in the objective function to encourage
better interpretability. We conduct various experiments to test ProtoX. Results
show that ProtoX achieved high fidelity to the original black-box agent while
providing meaningful and understandable explanations.

knowledge of motion style shifts: (i) a low-rank motion style adapter that
projects and adjusts the style features at a low-dimensional bottleneck; and
(ii) a modular adapter strategy that disentangles the features of scene context
and motion history to facilitate a fine-grained choice of adaptation layers.
Through extensive experimentation, we show that our proposed adapter design,
coined MoSA, outperforms prior methods on several forecasting benchmarks.

it is the basis of heart rate variability analysis. The Pan-Tompkins algorithm
is the most widely used QRS complex detector for the monitoring of many cardiac
diseases including arrhythmia detection. However, the performance of the
Pan-Tompkins algorithm in detecting the QRS complexes degrades in low-quality
and noisy signals. This article introduces Pan-Tompkins++, an improved
Pan-Tompkins algorithm. A bandpass filter with a passband of 5--18 Hz followed
by an N-point moving average filter has been applied to remove the noise
without discarding the significant signal components. Pan-Tompkins++ uses three
thresholds to distinguish between R-peaks and noise peaks. Rather than using a
generalized equation, different rules are applied to adjust the thresholds
based on the pattern of the signal for the accurate detection of R-peaks under
significant changes in signal pattern. The proposed algorithm reduces the False
Positive and False Negative detections, and hence improves the robustness and
performance of Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Pan-Tompkins++ has been tested on four
open source datasets. The experimental results show noticeable improvement for
both R-peak detection and execution time. We achieve 2.8% and 1.8% reduction in
FP and FN, respectively, and 2.2% increase in F-score on average across four
datasets, with 33% reduction in execution time. We show specific examples to
demonstrate that in situations where the Pan-Tompkins algorithm fails to
identify R-peaks, the proposed algorithm is found to be effective. The results
have also been contrasted with other well-known R-peak detection algorithms.

for mobile robots. To this end, inertial measurement units (IMUs) play an
important role because they can perceive the full motion state of the vehicle
independently. However, it suffers from accumulative error due to inherent
noise and bias instability, especially for low-cost sensors. In our previous
studies on Wheel-INS \cite{niu2021, wu2021}, we proposed to limit the error
drift of the pure inertial navigation system (INS) by mounting an IMU to the
wheel of the robot to take advantage of rotation modulation. However, Wheel-INS
still drifted over a long period of time due to the lack of external correction
signals. In this letter, we propose to exploit the environmental perception
ability of Wheel-INS to achieve simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
with only one IMU. To be specific, we use the road bank angles (mirrored by the
robot roll angles estimated by Wheel-INS) as terrain features to enable the
loop closure with a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. The road bank angle is
sampled and stored according to the robot position in the grid maps maintained
by the particles. The weights of the particles are updated according to the
difference between the currently estimated roll sequence and the terrain map.
Field experiments suggest the feasibility of the idea to perform SLAM in
Wheel-INS using the robot roll angle estimates. In addition, the positioning
accuracy is improved significantly (more than 30\%) over Wheel-INS. The source

drag reduction at friction Reynolds numbers $Re_\tau = 951$ and $4000$. The
actuation parameter space is restricted to the inner-scaled actuation (ISA)
pathway, where drag reduction is achieved through direct attenuation of the
near-wall scales. The level of turbulence attenuation, hence drag reduction, is
found to change with the near-wall Stokes layer protrusion height
$\ell_{0.01}$. A range of frequencies is identified where the Stokes layer
attenuates turbulence, lifting up the cycle of turbulence generation and
thickening the viscous sublayer; in this range, the drag reduction increases as
$\ell_{0.01}$ increases up to $30$ viscous units. Outside this range, the
strong Stokes shear strain enhances near-wall turbulence generation leading to
a drop in drag reduction with increasing $\ell_{0.01}$. We further find that,
within our parameter and Reynolds number space, the ISA pathway has a power
cost that always exceeds any drag reduction savings. This motivates the study
of the outer-scaled actuation (OSA) pathway in Part 2, where drag reduction is

and particularly at the many-body level of theory. For the many-body
computations, we employ the well-established many-body method known as the
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). We
present how various degrees of fragmentation can be generated following the
breakup of the ground state densities in anharmonic traps without ramping up a
potential barrier for strong rotations. The breakup of the densities is found
to be associated with the acquisition of angular momentum in the condensate due
to the rotation. In addition to fragmentation, the presence of many-body
correlations is examined by computing the variances of the many-particle
position and momentum operators. For strong rotations, the many-body variances
become smaller than their mean-field counterparts, and one even finds a
scenario with opposite anisotropies of the mean-field and many-body variances.
Further, it is observed that for higher discrete symmetric systems of order k,
namely three-fold and four-fold symmetry, breakup to k sub-clouds and emergence
of k-fold fragmentation take place. All in all, we provide a thorough many-body
investigation of how and which correlations build up when a trapped

a self-supervised learning technique referred to as contrastive learning. There
are two main variants of contrastive learning, namely instance and class
discrimination, targeting features that can discriminate between different
instances for the former, and different classes for the latter.
  In this paper, we aim to understand the effectiveness and limitation of
existing contrastive learning methods for OOD detection. We approach this in 3
ways. First, we systematically study the performance difference between the
instance discrimination and supervised contrastive learning variants in
different OOD detection settings. Second, we study which in-distribution (ID)
classes OOD data tend to be classified into. Finally, we study the spectral
decay property of the different contrastive learning approaches and examine how
it correlates with OOD detection performance. In scenarios where the ID and OOD
datasets are sufficiently different from one another, we see that instance
discrimination, in the absence of fine-tuning, is competitive with supervised
approaches in OOD detection. We see that OOD samples tend to be classified into
classes that have a distribution similar to the distribution of the entire
dataset. Furthermore, we show that contrastive learning learns a feature space
that contains singular vectors containing several directions with a high
variance which can be detrimental or beneficial to OOD detection depending on
the inference approach used.

associated with children (less than 15 years), senior pedestrians (greater than

failure to yield, inattentive/distracted, illness/fatigue/asleep. Additionally,
young drivers (15-24 years) are involved in severe pedestrian crashes in
daylight conditions. This study also found pedestrian alcohol/drug involvement
as the most frequent item in the dark-with-streetlight condition. This crash
type is particularly associated with pedestrian action (crossing
intersection/midblock), driver age (55-64 years), speed limit (30-35 mph), and
specific area type (business with mixed residential area). Fatal pedestrian
crashes are found to be associated with roadways with high-speed limits (>50

linked with high-speed limit related crashes are pedestrians walking
with/against the traffic, presence of pedestrian dark clothing, pedestrian
alcohol/drug involvement. The research findings are expected to provide an
improved understanding of the underlying relationships between pedestrian crash
risk factors and specific lighting conditions. Highway safety experts can

pulses of light drive matter to emit high harmonics of the driving frequency,
reaching the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray spectral ranges. So far, the
HHG process was always generated by intense laser pulses that are well
described as a classical electromagnetic field. Advances in the generation of
intense squeezed light motivate us to revisit the fundamentals of HHG and ask
how the photon statistics of light may alter this process, and more generally
alter the field of extreme nonlinear optics. The role of photon statistics in
non-perturbative interactions of intense light with matter has remained
unexplored in both experiments and theory. Here we show that the defining
spectral characteristics of HHG, such as the plateau and cutoff, are sensitive
to the photon statistics of the driving light. While coherent (classical) and
Fock light states induce the established HHG cutoff law, thermal and squeezed
states substantially surpass it, extending the cutoff compared to classical
light of the same intensity. Hence, shaping the photon statistics of light
enables producing far higher harmonics in HHG. We develop the theory of extreme
nonlinear optics driven by squeezed light, and more generally by arbitrary
quantum states of light. Our work introduces quantum optical concepts to
strong-field physics as new degrees of freedom in the creation and control of
HHG, and finally shows that experiments in this field are feasible. Looking
forward, HHG driven by quantum light creates quantum states of XUV and X-rays,
enabling applications of quantum optics in new spectral regimes.

computing separation/attraction structures within the flow field. Yet
bottlenecks in flow map computation, namely the numerical integration of vector
fields, can easily inhibit their use within interactive visualization settings.
In response, in our work we seek neural representations of flow maps that are
efficient to evaluate, while remaining scalable to optimize, both in

can frame the process of representation learning not in optimizing for samples
of the flow map, but rather, a self-consistency criterion on flow map
derivatives that eliminates the need for flow map samples, and thus numerical
integration, altogether. Central to realizing this is a novel neural network
design for flow maps, coupled with an optimization scheme, wherein our
representation only requires the time-varying vector field for learning,
encoded as instantaneous velocity. We show the benefits of our method over
prior works in terms of accuracy and efficiency across a range of 2D and 3D

will be essential for everyday needs. Hydrogen-based energy can play a vital
role in this aspect. This energy is green, clean, and renewable.
Elec-trochemical hydrogen devices have been used extensively in nuclear power
plants to manage hydrogen-based renewable fuel. Doped zirconate materials are
commonly used as an electrolyte in these electrochemical devices. These
materials have excellent physical stability and high proton transport numbers,
which make them suitable for multiple applications. Doping enhances the
physical and electronic properties of zirconate materials and makes them ideal
for practical applications. This review highlights the applications of
zirconate-based pro-ton-conducting materials in electrochemical cells,
particularly in tritium monitors, tritium recovery, hydrogen sensors, and
hydrogen pump systems. The central section of this review summarizes recent
investigations and provides a comprehensive insight into the various doping
schemes, experimental setup, instrumentation, op-timum operating conditions,
morphology, composition, and performance of zirconate electrolyte materials. In
addition, different challenges that are hindering zirconate materials from
achieving their full potential in elec-trochemical hydrogen devices are
discussed. Finally, this paper lays out a few pathways for aspirants who wish
to undertake research in this field.

computationally expensive complex analysis that involves source-specific noise
studies. As more pulsars are added to the arrays, this stage of PTA analysis
will become increasingly challenging. Therefore, optimizing the number of
included pulsars is crucial to reduce the computational burden of data
analysis. Here, we present a suite of methods to rank pulsars for use within
the scope of PTA analysis. First, we use the maximization of the
signal-to-noise ratio as a proxy to select pulsars. With this method, we target
the detection of stochastic and continuous gravitational wave signals. Next, we
present a ranking that minimizes the coupling between spatial correlation
signatures, namely monopolar, dipolar, and Hellings & Downs correlations.
Finally, we also explore how to combine these two methods. We test these
approaches against mock data using frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing.
For equal-noise pulsars, we find that an optimal selection leads to an increase
in the log-Bayes factor two times steeper than a random selection for the
hypothesis test of a gravitational wave background versus a common uncorrelated
red noise process. For the same test but for a realistic EPTA dataset, a subset
of 25 pulsars selected out of 40 can provide a log-likelihood ratio that is
$89\%$ of the total, implying that an optimally selected subset of pulsars can
yield results comparable to those obtained from the whole array. We expect
these selection methods to play a crucial role in future PTA data combinations.

as building block in high-frequency transistors. Here, we introduce a facile
route for the top-down fabrication of ordered arrays of GaN NWs with aspect
ratios exceeding $10$ and diameters below $20\,$nm. Highly uniform thin GaN NWs
are first obtained by using electron beam lithography to pattern a Ni/SiN$_x$
hard mask, followed by dry etching and wet etching in hot KOH. The SiN$_x$ is
found to work as an etch stop during wet etching in hot KOH. Arrays with NW
diameters down to $(33 \pm5)\,$nm can be achieved with a yield exceeding
$99.9\,\%$. Further reduction of the NW diameter down to $5\,$nm is obtained by
applying digital etching which consists in plasma oxidation followed by wet
etching in hot KOH. The NW radial etching depth is tuned by varying the RF
power during plasma oxidation. NW breaking or bundling is observed for
diameters below $\approx 20\,$nm, an effect that is associated to capillary
forces acting on the NWs during sample drying in air. This effect can be
principally mitigated using critical point dryers. Interestingly, this
mechanical instability of the NWs is found to occur at much smaller aspect
ratios than what is predicted for models dealing with macroscopic elastic rods.
Explicit calculations of buckling states show an improved agreement when
considering an inclined water surface, as can be expected if water assembles
into droplets. The proposed fabrication route can be principally applied to any
GaN/SiN$_{x}$ nanostructures and allows regrowth after removal of the SiN$_{x}$
mask.

purposes. Recent RGB-based methods opt to solve pose estimation problems using
small datasets, making them more attractive for the X-ray domain where medical

(SingleShotPose) to estimate the 6D pose of a marked cube from grayscale X-ray

adjusted for X-ray acquisition geometry. The model regresses 2D control points

Perspective-n-Point(PnP), allowing a single trained model to be used across all

process is time-homogeneous, a closed-form likelihood function can be derived
from the Kolmogorov forward equations -- a system of differential equations

find that under the stressed measure, the intensity and the severity
distribution of the process depend on time and state. We illustrate the dynamic
stress testing by considering stresses on VaR and both VaR and CVaR jointly and
provide illustrations of how the stochastic process is altered under these
stresses. We generalize the framework to multivariate compound Poisson
processes and stresses at times other than the terminal time. We illustrate the
applicability of our framework by considering ``what if'' scenarios, where we
answer the question: What is the severity of a stress on a portfolio component
at an earlier time such that the aggregate portfolio exceeds a risk threshold
at the terminal time? Furthermore, for general constraints, we propose an
algorithm to simulate sample paths under the stressed measure, thus allowing to
compare the effects of stresses on the dynamics of the process.

Traditionally, clinker phases are analyzed from optical images relying on a

the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We
study convergence problems for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), with
the depth parameter $\delta > 0$, in the deep-water limit ($\delta \to \infty$)
and the shallow-water limit ($\delta \to 0$) from a statistical point of view.
In particular, we establish convergence of invariant Gibbs dynamics for ILW in
both the deep-water and shallow-water limits. For this purpose, we first
construct the Gibbs measures for ILW, $0 < \delta < \infty$. As they are
supported on distributions, a renormalization is required. With the Wick
renormalization, we carry out the construction of the Gibbs measures for ILW.
We then prove that the Gibbs measures for ILW converge in total variation to
that for the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit. In the
shallow-water regime, after applying a scaling transformation, we prove that,
as $\delta \to 0$, the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW converge weakly to
that for the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). We point out that this second
result is of particular interest since the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW
and KdV are mutually singular (whereas the Gibbs measures for ILW and BO are
equivalent).
  We also discuss convergence of the associated dynamical problem.
  Lastly, we point out that our results also apply to the generalized ILW
equation in the defocusing case, converging to the generalized BO in the
deep-water limit and to the generalized KdV in the shallow-water limit. In the
non-defocusing case, however, our results can not be extended to a nonlinearity
with a higher power due to the non-normalizability of the corresponding Gibbs
measures.

conditions under which judging an arbitrage opportunity requires Bayesian
market participants to exercise their higher-order beliefs. As a Bayesian, an
agent must carry a complete recursion of priors over the uncertainty about
future asset payouts, the strategies employed by other market participants that
are aggregated in the price, other market participants' beliefs about the
agent's strategy, other market participants beliefs about what the agent
believes their strategies to be, and so on ad infinitum. Defining this infinite
recursion of priors -- the belief hierarchy so to speak -- along with how they
update gives the Bayesian decision problem equivalent to the standard asset
pricing formulation of the question. The main results of the paper show that an
arbitrage trade arises only when an agent updates his recursion of priors about
the strategies and beliefs employed by other market participants. The paper
thus connects the foundations of finance to the foundations of game theory by
identifying a bridge from market arbitrage to market participant belief
hierarchies.

usually originating from cosmological distances. The discovery of FRB 200428
and its X-ray counterpart from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 suggests
that at least some FRBs can be generated by magnetars. However, the majority of
X-ray bursts from magnetars are not associated with radio emission. The fact
that only in rare cases can an FRB be generated raises the question regarding
the special triggering mechanism of FRBs. Here we report a giant glitch from
SGR J1935+2154, which occurred approximately $3.1\pm2.5$\,day before FRB
200428, with $\Delta\nu=19.8\pm1.4$ {\rm $\mu$Hz} and
$\Delta\dot{\nu}=6.3\pm1.1$\,pHz s$^{-1}$. The corresponding spin-down power
change rate $\Delta\dot\nu/\dot\nu$ is among the largest in all the detected
pulsar glitches. The glitch contains a delayed spin-up process that is only
detected in the Crab pulsar and the magnetar 1E 2259+586, a large persistent
offset of the spin-down rate, and a recovery component which is about one order
of magnitude smaller than the persistent one. The temporal coincidence between
the glitch and FRB 200428 suggests a physical connection between the two. The
internally triggered giant glitch of the magnetar likely altered the
magnetosphere structure dramatically in favour of FRB generation, which
subsequently triggered many X-ray bursts and eventually FRB 200428 through
additional crustal cracking and Alfv\'en wave excitation and propagation.

communication signals for sensing the environment around a base station, faces
challenging issues of clock asynchronism and the requirement of a line-of-sight
(LOS) path between transmitters and receivers. The channel state information
(CSI) ratio has been applied to resolve these issues, however, current research
on the CSI ratio is limited to Doppler estimation in a single dynamic path.
This paper proposes an advanced parameter estimation scheme that can extract
multiple dynamic parameters, including Doppler frequency, angle-of-arrival
(AoA), and delay, in a communication uplink channel and completes the
localization of multiple moving targets. Our scheme is based on the
multi-element Taylor series of the CSI ratio that converts a nonlinear function
of sensing parameters to linear forms and enables the applications of
traditional sensing algorithms. Using the truncated Taylor series, we develop
novel multiple-signal-classification grid searching algorithms for estimating
Doppler frequencies and AoAs and use the least-square method to obtain delays.
Both experimental and simulation results are provided, demonstrating that our
proposed scheme can achieve good performances for sensing both single and

implicit features, CLORE parses explanations into logical structures and then
explicitly reasons along thess structures on the input to produce a

zero-shot classification on visual modality. Alongside classification

clear form of rationale. Through empirical analysis we demonstrate that CLORE
is also less affected by linguistic biases than baselines.

ProTac, that possesses multiple sensing modes: tactile and proximity sensing,
based on computer vision and a functional material. These modalities come from
a layered structure of a soft transparent silicon skin, a polymer dispersed
liquid crystal (PDLC) film, and reflective markers. Here, the PDLC film can
switch actively between the opaque and the transparent state, from which the
tactile sensing and proximity sensing can be obtained by using cameras solely
built inside the ProTac link. In this paper, inference algorithms for tactile
proximity perception are introduced. Evaluation results of two sensing
modalities demonstrated that, with a simple activation strategy, ProTac link
could effectively perceive useful information from both approaching and
in-contact obstacles. The proposed sensing device is expected to bring in
ultimate solutions for design of robots with softness, whole-body and

thrives interest. The logistic map $x_{t+1}=1-a x_t^2 \in [-1,1]\;(a\in [0,2])$
is neither large, since it has only one degree of freedom, nor closed, since it
is dissipative. It exhibits, nevertheless, a peculiar time evolution of its
natural entropy, which is the additive Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon one,
$S_{BG}=-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$, for all values of $a$ for which the
Lyapunov exponent is positive, and the nonadditive one $S_q=

the most chaotic case ($a=2$), whereas, in remarkable contrast, it appears to
monotonically diverge at the Feigenbaum point ($a=1.4011\dots$). Consequently,
the stationary-state entropy value is achieved from {\it above}, instead of
from {\it below}, as it could have been a priori expected. These results raise
the question whether the usual requirements -- large, closed, and for generic

controlled experiments (a.k.a. A/B testing) to guide product development and

increasing treatment allocation: the new treatment is gradually released to an
increasing number of units through a sequence of randomized experiments. In
scenarios such as experimenting in a social network setting or in a bipartite
online marketplace, interference among units may exist, which can harm the
validity of simple inference procedures. In this work, we introduce a widely
applicable procedure to test for interference in A/B testing with increasing
allocation. Our procedure can be implemented on top of an existing A/B testing
platform with a separate flow and does not require a priori a specific

we introduce a testing procedure that is valid under a time fixed effect

is powerful, and it formalizes a heuristic algorithm implemented already in
industry. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed testing procedure

language models requires a lot of training data, which is not available for
African Languages. Active learning is a semi-supervised learning algorithm, in
which a model consistently and dynamically learns to identify the most
beneficial samples to train itself on, in order to achieve better optimization
and performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, active learning effectively
and practically addresses real-world data scarcity. Despite all its benefits,
active learning, in the context of NLP and especially multilingual language
models pretraining, has received little consideration. In this paper, we
present AfroLM, a multilingual language model pretrained from scratch on 23
African languages (the largest effort to date) using our novel self-active
learning framework. Pretrained on a dataset significantly (14x) smaller than
existing baselines, AfroLM outperforms many multilingual pretrained language
models (AfriBERTa, XLMR-base, mBERT) on various NLP downstream tasks (NER, text
classification, and sentiment analysis). Additional out-of-domain sentiment
analysis experiments show that \textbf{AfroLM} is able to generalize well
across various domains. We release the code source, and our datasets used in

synthesizing high-quality images with remarkable diversity when trained on
large amounts of data. However, to our knowledge, few-shot image generation
tasks have yet to be studied with DDPM-based approaches. Modern approaches are
mainly built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and adapt models
pre-trained on large source domains to target domains using a few available
samples. In this paper, we make the first attempt to study when do DDPMs
overfit and suffer severe diversity degradation as training data become scarce.
Then we fine-tune DDPMs pre-trained on large source domains to solve the
overfitting problem when training data is limited. Although the directly
fine-tuned models accelerate convergence and improve generation quality and
diversity compared with training from scratch, they still fail to retain some
diverse features and can only produce coarse images. Therefore, we design a
DDPM pairwise adaptation (DDPM-PA) approach to optimize few-shot DDPM domain
adaptation. DDPM-PA efficiently preserves information learned from source
domains by keeping the relative pairwise distances between generated samples
during adaptation. Besides, DDPM-PA enhances the learning of high-frequency
details from source models and limited training data. DDPM-PA further improves
generation quality and diversity and achieves results better than current
state-of-the-art GAN-based approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a series of few-shot image generation tasks qualitatively and
quantitatively.

discoveries of hydride-based superconductors, mostly at high pressures, during

future discoveries if their reliability can be improved. The main challenge of
current ML approaches, typically aiming at predicting the critical temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ of a solid from its chemical composition and target pressure, is
that the correlations to be learned are deeply hidden, indirect, and uncertain.
In this work, we showed that predicting superconductivity at any pressure from
the atomic structure is sustainable and reliable. For a demonstration, we
curated a diverse dataset of 584 atomic structures for which $\lambda$ and
$\omega_{\log}$, two parameters of the electron-phonon interactions, were
computed. We then trained some ML models to predict $\lambda$ and
$\omega_{\log}$, from which $T_{\rm c}$ can be computed in a post-processing
manner. The models were validated and used to identify two possible
superconductors whose $T_{\rm c}\simeq 10-15$K at zero pressure. Interestingly,
these materials have been synthesized and studied in some other contexts. In
summary, the proposed ML approach enables a pathway to directly transfer what
can be learned from the high-pressure atomic-level details that correlate with
high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity to zero pressure. Going forward, this
strategy will be improved to better contribute to the discoveries of new
superconductors.

by showing that it not only cuts the feedback but also is the best

support system called sleep staging, an essential step in diagnosing sleep
disorders. Clinical sleep staging is an arduous process requiring manual
annotation for each 30s of sleep using physiological signals such as
electroencephalogram (EEG). Recent work has shown that sleep staging using
simple models and an exhaustive set of features can perform nearly as well as
deep learning approaches but only for some specific datasets. Moreover, the
utility of those features from a clinical standpoint is ambiguous. On the other
hand, the proposed framework, NormIntSleep demonstrates exceptional performance
across different datasets by representing deep learning embeddings using
normalized features. NormIntSleep performs 4.5% better than the exhaustive

approaches. An empirical comparison between the utility of the interpretations
of these models highlights the improved alignment with clinical expectations

each peak represents a non-blank token. The recognition latency of CTC models

methods to reduce latency require modifying the transition relationship between
tokens in the forward-backward algorithm, and the gradient calculation. Some of
these methods even depend on the forced alignment results provided by other

The advantage of SLOPT is that it can generally be incorporated into existing
fuzzers, such as AFL and Honggfuzz. As a proof of concept, we implemented
SLOPT-AFL++ by integrating SLOPT into AFL++ and showed that the
program-agnostic optimization delivered by SLOPT enabled SLOPT-AFL++ to achieve

We find that commonality in liquidity is higher for large stocks compared to

increased over the past two decades. We show that this divergence can be
explained by foreign institutional ownership. This finding suggests that
foreign institutional investment contributes to an increase in the exposure of
large stocks to unexpected liquidity events in the local market. We find a
positive association between foreign institutional ownership and commonality in

unknown source string $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ from independent ""traces"", i.e. copies
of $x$ that have been corrupted by a $\delta$-deletion channel which
independently deletes each bit of $x$ with probability $\delta$ and
concatenates the surviving bits. The current paper considers the extreme
data-limited regime in which only a single trace is provided to the
reconstruction algorithm. In this setting exact reconstruction is of course
impossible, and the question is to what accuracy the source string $x$ can be
approximately reconstructed.
  We give a detailed study of this question, providing algorithms and lower
bounds for the high, intermediate, and low deletion rate regimes in both the
worst-case ($x$ is arbitrary) and average-case ($x$ is drawn uniformly from
$\{0,1\}^n$) models. In several cases the lower bounds we establish are matched
by computationally efficient algorithms that we provide.
  We highlight our results for the high deletion rate regime: roughly speaking,
they show that
  - Having access to a single trace is already quite useful for worst-case
trace reconstruction: an efficient algorithm can perform much more accurate
reconstruction, given one trace that is even only a few bits long, than it
could given no traces at all. But in contrast,
  - in the average-case setting, having access to a single trace is provably
not very useful: no algorithm, computationally efficient or otherwise, can
achieve significantly higher accuracy given one trace that is $o(n)$ bits long
than it could with no traces.

the coupling of multiple processes with widely disparate time scales. The
advent of exascale computing systems exacerbates these challenges, since these

interest in developing multirate methods as a means to handle the large range
of time scales, as these methods may afford greater accuracy and efficiency
than more traditional approaches of using IMEX and low-order operator splitting
schemes. However, there have been few performance studies that compare
different classes of multirate integrators on complex application problems. We
study the performance of several newly developed multirate infinitesimal (MRI)
methods, implemented in the SUNDIALS solver package, on two reacting flow model
problems built on structured mesh frameworks. The first model revisits the work
of Emmet et al. (2014) on a compressible reacting flow problem with complex
chemistry that is implemented using BoxLib but where we now include comparisons
between a new explicit MRI scheme with the multirate spectral deferred
correction (SDC) methods in the original paper. The second problem uses the
same complex chemistry as the first problem, combined with a simplified flow
model, but run at a large spatial scale where explicit methods become
infeasible due to stability constraints. Two recently developed
implicit-explicit MRI multirate methods are tested. These methods rely on
advanced features of the AMReX framework on which the model is built, such as
multilevel grids and multilevel preconditioners. The results from these two
problems show that MRI multirate methods can offer significant performance
benefits on complex multiphysics application problems and that these methods
may be combined with advanced spatial discretization to compound the advantages
of both.

use cases have proved the feasibility of FL in theory, in the industrial
practice of Metaverse, the problems of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-i.i.d.) data, learning forgetting caused by streaming
industrial data, and scarce communication bandwidth remain key barriers to
realize practical FL. Facing the above three challenges simultaneously, this
paper presents a high-performance and efficient system named HFEDMS for
incorporating practical FL into Industrial Metaverse. HFEDMS reduces data
heterogeneity through dynamic grouping and training mode conversion (Dynamic
Sequential-to-Parallel Training, STP). Then, it compensates for the forgotten
knowledge by fusing compressed historical data semantics and calibrates
classifier parameters (Semantic Compression and Compensation, SCC). Finally,
the network parameters of the feature extractor and classifier are synchronized
in different frequencies (Layer-wiseAlternative Synchronization Protocol, LASP)
to reduce communication costs. These techniques make FL more adaptable to the
heterogeneous streaming data continuously generated by industrial equipment,
and are also more efficient in communication than traditional methods (e.g.,
Federated Averaging). Extensive experiments have been conducted on the streamed
non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset using 368 simulated devices. Numerical results show
that HFEDMS improves the classification accuracy by at least 6.4% compared with
8 benchmarks and saves both the overall runtime and transfer bytes by up to

traffic safety due to the rapid development of communication technology and
computing capabilities. This paper aims at the problems of difficult
calibration and inconsistent thresholds in the existing risk assessment
methods. It proposes a risk assessment model based on the potential field to
quantify the driving risk of vehicles. Firstly, virtual energy is proposed as
an attribute considering vehicle sizes and velocity. Secondly, the driving risk
surrogate(DRS) is proposed based on potential field theory to describe the risk
degree of vehicles. Risk factors are quantified by establishing submodels,
including an interactive vehicle risk surrogate, a restrictions risk surrogate,
and a speed risk surrogate. To unify the risk threshold, acceleration for
implementation guidance is derived from the risk field strength. Finally, a
naturalistic driving dataset in Nanjing, China, is selected, and 3063 pairs of
following naturalistic trajectories are screened out. Based on that, the
proposed model and other models use for comparisons are calibrated through the
improved particle optimization algorithm. Simulations prove that the proposed

two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) vortex-induced-vibrations (VIV) characteristics
of an elastically mounted circular cylinder. The cylinder is allowed to vibrate
in both streamwise and transverse directions. A low value of mass-ratio with
the zero damping coefficient is taken for the simulations. The primary aim is
to understand the vortex shedding behind the cylinder and the transition
characteristics of the wake-flow from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional
(3D). The Reynolds number (Re) is varied from 150 (fully 2D flow) to 1000
(fully 3D flow), which lies inside the laminar range. The reduced velocity is
varied which covers all three major VIV branches (Initial Branch (IB), Upper
Branch (UB), and the Lower Branch (LB)). The oscillating cylinder sweeps the
figure-eight trajectory. Two branches (IB, LB) and three branches (IB, UB, LB)
amplitude responses are obtained for the low and high Re values, respectively.
The wake behind the cylinder with 2-DOF VIV undergoes the mode-C transition of
2D to 3D flow as opposed to the direct mode-B transition observed for
transverse only VIV in the literature. The critical Re range of the 2D to 3D
transition for the 2-DOF VIV cylinder at a reduced velocity of 6 is around 250,
less than the 1-DOF VIV. Also, this range varies with the variation in and the
streamwise to transverse oscillation frequency ratio. A map is proposed for the
2-DOF VIV, highlighting the different modes of transition obtained for
combinations of reduced frequency and Re.

quantized phase values. The closed-form expressions for OP and ergodic rate are
derived for the considered system. Next, two optimization problems are
formulated to choose the phase shifts of IRS such that (i) OP is minimized and
(ii) the ergodic rate is maximized. We used the multi-valued particle swarm

study in condensed matter physics. A unique topological transition between

living at criticalities. In this work, we generalize this phenomenon by
investigating possible transitions between critical phases which are non-high
symmetry in nature. We find the triviality and non-triviality of these critical
phases in terms of the decay length of the edge modes and also characterize
them using the winding numbers. The distinct non-high symmetry critical phases
are separated by multicritical points with linear dispersion at which the
winding number exhibits the quantized jump, indicating a change in the topology
(number of edge modes) at the critical phases. Moreover, we reframe the scaling
theory based on the curvature function, i.e. curvature function renormalization
group method to efficiently address the non-high symmetry criticalities and
multicriticalities. Using this we identify the conventional topological
transition between gapped phases through non-high symmetry critical points, and
also the unique topological transition between critical phases through
multicritical points. The renormalization group flow, critical exponents and
correlation function of Wannier states enable the characterization of non-high
symmetry criticalities along with multicriticalities.

electron-hole pair correlations in the polariton condensate become universal

effect of different ranged interactions between charge carriers, we find that
the Rytova-Keldysh potential (relevant to transition metal dichalcogenides)
offers the best prospect of reaching the BCS regime, where pairs strongly
overlap and the minimum pairing gap occurs at finite momentum. Finally, going

detonation remains uncertain. In the present work, we conduct a self-consistent
hydrodynamic study on the spontaneous ignition of the helium envelope in the
context of the double-degenerate channel, by applying an idealized
one-dimensional model and a simplified 7 isotope reaction network. We explore a
wide range of the progenitor conditions, and demonstrate that the chance of
direct initiation of detonation is limited. Especially, the spontaneous
detonation requires the primary envelope mass of >~ 0.03 solar mass. Ignition
as deflagration is instead far more likely, which is feasible for the lower
envelope mass down to ~ 0.01 solar mass, which might lead to subsequent
detonation once the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) would be
realized. High-resolution multi-dimensional simulations are required to further
investigate the DDT possibility, as well as accurately derive the threshold
between the spontaneous detonation and deflagration ignition regimes. Another
interesting finding is the effect of the composition; while mixing with the
core material enhances detonation as previously suggested, it rather narrows
the chance for deflagration due to the slower rate of 12C(alpha,gamma)16O
reaction at the lower temperature ~108K, with the caveat that we presently
neglect the proton-catalyzed reaction sequence of 12C(p,gamma)13O(alpha,p)16O.

work in modeling and reconstructing graphons often approximates a target
graphon by a fixed resolution piece-wise constant representation. Our IGNR has
the benefit that it can represent graphons up to arbitrary resolutions, and
enables natural and efficient generation of arbitrary sized graphs with desired

to be unaligned and have different sizes by leveraging the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by showing its
superior performance on a graphon learning task. We then propose an extension
of IGNR that can be incorporated into an auto-encoder framework, and
demonstrate its good performance under a more general setting of graphon

Based on the obtained scattering properties, we study the thermal-magnon-driven
dynamics of a domain wall subjected to a thermal bias within the

developed for topological data analysis (TDA). Although it is conceptually
attractive, multi-parameter persistent homology still has challenges in theory

embedding. The proposed method is highly efficient even if the sliding window
embedding dimension and the length of time-series data are large because the
method precomputes the exact barcode and the computational complexity is as low

method provides a way of finding different topological inferences by trying
different rays in the filtration space in no time.

sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch, $r_d$ (which is a function of the

Virtual semantic Prototypes (ConPVP). Specifically, with the help of prompts,
we construct virtual semantic prototypes to each instance, and derive negative
prototypes by using the negative form of the prompts. Using a prototypical
contrastive loss, we enforce the anchor sentence embedding to be close to its
corresponding semantic prototypes, and far apart from the negative prototypes
as well as the prototypes of other sentences. Extensive experimental results on
semantic textual similarity, transfer, and clustering tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed model compared to strong baselines. Code is

In this work, we describe a state-of-the-art strategy to address these

in combination with a general algorithm for generating the neural-network

developed NNP faithfully reproduces the phase stabilities and structural
characteristics obtained from the ab initio calculations and experiments. In
the combined NNP-SHMC algorithm, the structure equilibration time in the deeply
supercooled temperatures is accelerated by at least five orders of magnitudes,
and the quenched glassy samples exhibit comparable stability to those prepared
in the laboratory. Our results pave the way for the next-generation studies of
the vitrification process and, thereby the composition-dependent glass-forming

alternating optimization and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The uncertainty-based
automatic adjustment of hyper-parameters is also applied to eliminate the need
of laborious hyper-parameter analysis during optimization. By optimizing the

enhancement in damping-like torque efficiency {\theta}_DL due to the modified

N-implanted Pt. We observe a crossover of intrinsic to extrinsic side-jump
mechanism as the implantation dose increases from 2*10^16 ions/cm2 to 1*10^17

counterbalanced by the increase in the side-jump induced SHE efficiency. These
results conclude that studying {\theta}_DL as a function of implantation dose,
and also as a function of temperature, is important to understand the physical
mechanism contributing to SHE, which has so far been unexplored in
incorporating non-metallic element in 5d transition metals.

comprised of three dissolution patterns (wormhole, compact, and uniform) - or

injection using numerical simulations on two porous media structures of
increasing complexity. We examine the boundaries between regimes and
characterise the existence of a fourth regime called channeling, where already
existing fast flow pathways are preferentially widened by dissolution.
Channeling occurs in cases where the distribution in pore throat size results
in orders of magnitude differences in flow rate for different flow pathways.
This focusing of dissolution along only dominant flow paths induces an
immediate, large change in permeability with a comparatively small change in
porosity, resulting in a porosity-permeability relationship unlike any that has
been previously seen. This work demonstrates that our current conceptual model
of dissolution regimes must be modified to include channeling for accurate
predictions of dissolution in applications such as geologic carbon storage and
geothermal energy production.

based on fairly simple mathematical and physical foundations. This theory has
been developed for any type of BS and is based on the constancy of the
reflection coefficients $R$ (or the transmission coefficient, where $R+T=1$)
and the phase shift $\phi$. It has recently been shown that the constancy of
these coefficients cannot always be satisfied for a waveguide BS, where $R$ and
$\phi$ depend in a special way on photon frequencies. Based on this, this
review systematizes the concept of BS in quantum optics into ``Conventional''
and frequency-dependent BS, and also presents the theory of such BS. It is
shown that the quantum entanglement, photon statistics at the output ports, and
the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect for such BS can be very different. Taking into
account the fact that the waveguide BS is currently acquiring an important role
in quantum technologies due to the possibility of its miniaturization, this
review will be useful not only for theoreticians, but also for experimenters.

morphology and origin of this arm-like structure, and to assess whether it
could trace a spiral density wave caused by the dynamical interaction between
the planet PDS 70c and the disk. We analyze polarized and angular differential
imaging (PDI and ADI) data taken with VLT/SPHERE, spanning six years of
observations. PDI data sets are reduced using the IRDAP polarimetric data
reduction pipeline, while ADI data sets are processed using MUSTARD, a novel
inverse problem algorithm to tackle the geometrical biases spoiling the images
previously used for the analysis of this disk. We confirm the presence of the
arm-like structure in all PDI and ADI datasets. We do not observe a south-east
symmetric arm with respect to the disk minor axis, which seems to disfavor the
previous hypothesis that the arm is the footprint of a double-ring structure.
If the structure traces a spiral density wave following the motion of PDS 70c,
we would expect
$11\overset{\circ}{.}28^{+2\overset{\circ}{.}20}_{-0\overset{\circ}{.}86}$
rotation for the spiral in six years. However, we do not measure any
significant movement of the structure. If the arm-like structure is a
planet-driven spiral arm, the observed lack of rotation would suggest that the
assumption of rigid-body rotation may be inappropriate for spirals induced by
planets. We suggest that the arm-like structure may rather trace a vortex
appearing as a one-armed spiral in scattered light due to projection effects.
The vortex hypothesis accounts for both the lack of observed rotation and the
presence of a nearby sub-mm continuum asymmetry detected with ALMA.

one is the current flowing through the grid facing the plasma, the Plasma Grid,

current flowing between the Plasma Grid and the source walls. Both the filter
field and the bias current influence the fraction of co-extracted electrons,

been measured by a Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic; the detailed
analysis of the raw spectra collected by BES led to describing the beam with
two components of different divergence. This concept has been supported by the
information given by thermal imaging of the diagnostic calorimeter. Further
support to the proposed beam model has been found in the behavior of the

  with high-fidelity van der Waals layer stacking",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nanobelts, nanoribbons and other quasi-one-dimensional nanostructures formed
from layered, so-called, van der Waals semiconductors have garnered much
attention due to their high-performance, tunable optoelectronic properties. For
layered alloys made from the gallium monochalcogenides GaS, GaSe, and GaTe,
near-continuous tuning of the energy bandgap across the full composition range
has been achieved in GaSe1-xSx and GaSe1-xTex alloys. Gold-catalyzed
vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth of these alloys yields predominantly nanobelts,
nanoribbons and other nanostructures for which the fast crystal growth front
consists of layer edges in contact with the catalyst. We demonstrate that in
the S-rich, GaS1-xTex system, unlike GaSe1-xSx and GaSe1-xTex, the Au-catalyzed
VLS process yields van der Waals nanowires for which the fast growth direction
is normal to the layers. The high mismatch between S and Te leads to
extraordinary bowing of the GaS1-xTex alloy's energy bandgap, decreasing by at
least 0.6 eV for x as small as 0.03. Calculations using density functional
theory confirm the significant decrease in bandgap in S-rich GaS1-xTex. The
nanowires can exceed fifty micrometers in length, consisting of tens of
thousands of van der Waals-bonded layers with triangular or hexagonal
cross-sections of uniform dimensions along the length of the nanowire. We
propose that the low solubility of Te in GaS results in an enhancement in Te
coverage around the Au catalyst-nanowire interface, confining the catalyst to
the chalcogen-terminated basal plane (rather than the edges) and thereby
enabling layer-by-layer, c-axis growth.

hypermagnetic fields which are randomly distributed and oriented during the
electroweak phase transition in the early universe. The theory setup of this
study is the standard model plus a real singlet scalar field, which can produce
the needed strongly first order electroweak phase transition. Then we
investigate how the hypermagnetic fields can convert to magnetic fields and we
compute the departure of energy difference between the symmetric phase and the
broken phase when the magnetic fields are turned on. It is found that the
presence of the hypermagnetic fields can increase the Euclidean action, thus
can decrease nucleation temperature, which can lead to a supercool plasma. We
point out that the hypermagnetic field can enhance the gravitational wave
production from a first order electroweak phase transition and the
inhomogeneity of primordial hypermagnetic field can lead to anisotropies of
gravitational waves. By examining three well-motivated distribution of
hypermagnetic fields, we calculate the corresponding angular power spectra of
stochastic gravitational wave background and find they can be significantly
larger than the contributions of the Sachs-Wolfe effects and integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effects. Our results show that the anisotropies of gravitational

the crystalline structure and elastic moduli. Thus, the coexistence of
adsorbed/desorbed sites makes the host matrices elastically heterogeneous.
However, the role of elastic heterogeneity in the adsorption--desorption

heterogeneity in the adsorption--desorption transition. We construct a minimal
model incorporating adsorption-induced lattice expansion/contraction and an
increase/decrease in the elastic moduli. We discover that the transition is
hindered by the entropic and energetic effects which become asymmetric in
adsorption process and desorption process, leading to the strong hysteretic
nature of the transition. Furthermore, the adsorbed/desorbed sites exhibit
spatially heterogeneous domain formation, implying that the domain morphology

elastic heterogeneity. Our results provide a theoretical guideline for
designing soft porous crystals with tunable adsorption hysteresis and the

module that performs both contour vertex deformation and reduction, which
removes the need for complex empirical post-processing used in existing
methods. In both components, we provide new ideas, including a learnable
contour initialization method to replace the empirical methods, dynamic
predicted and ground truth vertex pairing for the static vertex correspondence
problem, and a lightweight encoder for vertex information extraction and
aggregation, which benefit a general contour-based method; and a well-designed
vertex classification head for building corner vertices detection, which casts
light on direct structured building contour extraction. We also built a
suitable large-scale building dataset, the WHU-Mix (vector) building dataset,

extensive experiments conducted on the WHU-Mix (vector) dataset, the WHU

steeply approaching $B_{0}\approx 40$ mT in the central part of the coil. This

near (at a distance proportional to the radius of the bubble) to the bubble. We
show that, at that small distance, the dominating field is reminiscent to the
wave created by a point-like obstacle modeled formally by a Dirac-like
heterogeneity with support at the location of the bubble and the contrast
between the bubble and background material as the scattering coefficient. As a
conclusion, we can tune the bubbles material properties so that the pressure
near it reaches a desired amount. Such design might be useful in the purpose of
acoustic cavitation where one needs enough, but not too much, pressure to
eliminate unwanted anomalies. The mathematical analysis is done using
time-domain integral equations and asymptotic analysis techniques. A well known
feature here is that the contrasting scales between the bubble and the
background generate resonances (mainly the Minnaert one) in the time-harmonic
regime. Such critical scales, and the generated resonances, are also reflected
in the time-domain estimation of the acoustic wave. In particular, reaching the
desired amount of pressure near the location of the bubble is possible only
with such resonating bubbles.

large direct current modulation of resonance linewidth in SrTiO3/AlN samples,
confirming its high {\theta}_cs and attesting an oxygen-vacancy-enabled

root (located at 1 or $-1$), or even two unit roots located at 1 and $-1$.
Finally, a set of simulations illustrate the asymptotic behavior of the OLS.
The results are essentially proved by $L^2$ computations and the limit theory
of triangular arrays of martingales.

facilitate the communication between special people and normal people, which
requires a certain degree of real-time and deploy-ability of the model.
However, in the previous research on CSLR, little attention has been paid to
the real-time and deploy-ability. In order to improve the real-time and
deploy-ability of the model, this paper proposes a zero parameter, zero
computation temporal superposition crossover module(TSCM), and combines it with
2D convolution to form a ""TSCM+2D convolution"" hybrid convolution, which
enables 2D convolution to have strong spatial-temporal modelling capability
with zero parameter increase and lower deployment cost compared with other
spatial-temporal convolutions. The overall CSLR model based on TSCM is built on
the improved ResBlockT network in this paper. The hybrid convolution of
""TSCM+2D convolution"" is applied to the ResBlock of the ResNet network to form
the new ResBlockT, and random gradient stop and multi-level CTC loss are
introduced to train the model, which reduces the final recognition WER while
reducing the training memory usage, and extends the ResNet network from image
classification task to video recognition task. In addition, this study is the
first in CSLR to use only 2D convolution extraction of sign language video
temporal-spatial features for end-to-end learning for recognition. Experiments
on two large-scale continuous sign language datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method and achieve highly competitive results.

training interaction data. This over-fitting significantly degrades
recommendation performances. To address this data sparsity problem,
cross-domain recommender systems (CDRSs) exploit the data from an auxiliary
source domain to facilitate the recommendation on the sparse target domain.
Most existing CDRSs rely on overlapping users or items to connect domains and
transfer knowledge. However, matching users is an arduous task and may involve
privacy issues when data comes from different companies, resulting in a limited
application for the above CDRSs. Some studies develop CDRSs that require no
overlapping users and items by transferring learned user interaction patterns.
However, they ignore the bias in user interaction patterns between domains and
hence suffer from an inferior performance compared with single-domain
recommender systems. In this paper, based on the above findings, we propose a
novel CDRS, namely semantic clustering enhanced debiasing graph neural
recommender system (SCDGN), that requires no overlapping users and items and
can handle the domain bias. More precisely, SCDGN semantically clusters items
from both domains and constructs a cross-domain bipartite graph generated from
item clusters and users. Then, the knowledge is transferred via this
cross-domain user-cluster graph from the source to the target. Furthermore, we
design a debiasing graph convolutional layer for SCDGN to extract unbiased
structural knowledge from the cross-domain user-cluster graph. Our Experimental
results on three public datasets and a pair of proprietary datasets verify the
effectiveness of SCDGN over state-of-the-art models in terms of cross-domain
recommendations.

performing tasks, such as selecting between seemingly equivalent optimal
actions, performing recovery actions when deviating from the optimal
trajectory, or moderating actions in response to sensed risks. However,
imitation learning, which attempts to teach robots to perform these same tasks
from observations of human demonstrations, often fails to capture such
behavior. Specifically, commonly used learning algorithms embody inherent
contradictions between the learning assumptions (e.g., single optimal action)
and actual human behavior (e.g., multiple optimal actions), thereby limiting
robot generalizability, applicability, and demonstration feasibility. To
address this, this paper proposes designing imitation learning algorithms with
a focus on utilizing human behavioral characteristics, thereby embodying
principles for capturing and exploiting actual demonstrator behavioral
characteristics. This paper presents the first imitation learning framework,
Bayesian Disturbance Injection (BDI), that typifies human behavioral
characteristics by incorporating model flexibility, robustification, and risk
sensitivity. Bayesian inference is used to learn flexible non-parametric
multi-action policies, while simultaneously robustifying policies by injecting
risk-sensitive disturbances to induce human recovery action and ensuring
demonstration feasibility. Our method is evaluated through risk-sensitive
simulations and real-robot experiments (e.g., table-sweep task, shaft-reach
task and shaft-insertion task) using the UR5e 6-DOF robotic arm, to demonstrate
the improved characterisation of behavior. Results show significant improvement
in task performance, through improved flexibility, robustness as well as
demonstration feasibility.

  We give upper and lower bounds for private coin, public coin, shared

that complexity in the public coin model is upper bounded by Randomized query

fractional and randomized certificate complexity, making it a good candidate to
prove strong lower bounds on randomized query complexity. Complexity in the
private coin model is bounded from below by zero-error randomized query
complexity.
  The quantum measure highlights an interesting and surprising difference
between classical and quantum query models. Whereas the public coin certificate
game complexity is bounded from above by randomized query complexity, the
quantum certificate game complexity can be quadratically larger than quantum
query complexity. We use non-signaling, a notion from quantum information, to
give a lower bound of $n$ on the quantum certificate game complexity of the
$OR$ function, whose quantum query complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, then go on
to show that this ``non-signaling bottleneck'' applies to all functions with
high sensitivity, block sensitivity or fractional block sensitivity.
  We consider the single-bit version of certificate games (inputs of the two
players have Hamming distance $1$). We prove that the single-bit version of
certificate game complexity with shared randomness is equal to sensitivity up
to constant factors, giving a new characterization of sensitivity. The
single-bit version with private randomness is equal to $\lambda^2$, where

an effective asymptotic description of the dynamics, we aim at accounting for
such universality in terms of underlying (effective) integrable structures.
More specifically, under a ``wave-mean flow'' perspective, we propose that fast
degrees of freedom corresponding to the observed waveform would be subject to
effective linear dynamics, propagating on a slowly evolving background subject
to (effective) non-linear integrable dynamics. The Painlev\'e property of the
latter would be implemented in terms of the so-called Painlev\'e-II
transcendent, providing a structural link between i) orbital (in particular,
EMRI) dynamics in the inspiral phase, ii) self-similar solutions of non-linear
dispersive Korteweg-de Vries-like equations (namely, the `modified Korteweg-de
Vries' equation) through the merger and iii) the matching with the isospectral
features of black hole quasi-normal modes in late ringdown dynamics. Moreover,
the Painlev\'e-II equation provides also a `non-linear turning point' problem,
extending the linear discussion in the recently introduced Airy approach to
binary black hole merger waveforms. Under the proposed integrability
perspective, the simplicity and universality of the binary black hole merger
waveform would be accounted to by the `hidden symmetries' of the underlying
integrable (effective) dynamics. In the spirit of asymptotic reasoning, and
considering Ward's conjecture linking integrability and self-dual Yang-Mills
structures, it is tantalizing to question if such universal patterns would
reflect the actual full integrability of a (self-dual) sector of general
relativity, ultimately responsible for the binary black hole waveform patterns.

  Detection on Edge for V2X Orchestration","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Edge computing-based 3D perception has received attention in intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) because real-time monitoring of traffic candidates
potentially strengthens Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) orchestration. Thanks to
the capability of precisely measuring the depth information on surroundings
from LiDAR, the increasing studies focus on lidar-based 3D detection, which
significantly promotes the development of 3D perception. Few methods met the
real-time requirement of edge deployment because of high computation-intensive
operations. Moreover, an inconsistency problem of object detection remains
uncovered in the pointcloud domain due to large sparsity. This paper thoroughly
analyses this problem, comprehensively roused by recent works on determining
inconsistency problems in the image specialisation. Therefore, we proposed a 3D
harmonic loss function to relieve the pointcloud based inconsistent
predictions. Moreover, the feasibility of 3D harmonic loss is demonstrated from
a mathematical optimization perspective. The KITTI dataset and DAIR-V2X-I
dataset are used for simulations, and our proposed method considerably improves
the performance than benchmark models. Further, the simulative deployment on an
edge device (Jetson Xavier TX) validates our proposed model's efficiency.

Taking one step forward to addressing such a problem, we propose Realistic

optimization of the tested driving strategies. RITA is developed with
consideration of three key features, i.e., fidelity, diversity, and
controllability, and consists of two core modules called RITABackend and
RITAKit. RITABackend is built to support vehicle-wise control and provide
traffic generation models from real-world datasets, while RITAKit is developed
with easy-to-use interfaces for controllable traffic generation via
RITABackend. We demonstrate RITA's capacity to create diversified and
high-fidelity traffic simulations in several highly interactive highway

anticipate, which gives them an edge in avoiding collisions and navigating in
cluttered spaces. These capabilities are impaired by digital distraction
through smartphones, a growing safety concern. To capture these features, we
put forward a continuous agent-based model (dubbed ANDA) hinging on a
transparent delineation of a decision-making process and a mechanical layer
that handles contacts and collisions. In the decisional layer, each agent
autonomously selects their desired velocity as the optimum of a perceived cost,
notably balancing the will to move forward (described by a floor field) with
the bio-mechanical cost of walking and the risk of collision, assessed by an
anticipated time-to-collision. Altogether, the model includes less than a dozen
parameters, most of which are fit using independent experimental data.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the versatility of the approach, which
succeeds in reproducing empirical observations in extremely diverse scenarios,
often quantitatively, with a single set of parameters. These scenarios range
from collision avoidance involving one, two, or more agents to collective flow
properties in unidirectional and bidirectional settings and to the dynamics of
evacuation through a bottleneck, where contact forces are directly accessible.
Remarkably, a straightforward transcription of digital distraction into the
model, by reducing the frequency of decisional updates, suffices to replicate
the enhanced chaoticity of the flow, with more frequent sudden turns, observed
experimentally when 'smartphone-walking' pedestrians are brought in. Finally,
the conceptual transparency of the model makes it easy to pinpoint the origin
of some deficiencies, notably its shortsighted account of anticipation (when
agents have to cross a group of people) and the disk-like pedestrian shape
(when very dense crowds are considered). Our work thus clarifies the singular
position of pedestrian crowds in the midst of active-matter systems.

nanostructures and light with orbital angular momentum (OAM), has attracted
researchers in a wide range of fields from the viewpoint of fundamental physics
and applications. However, the relation between the HD and the excited plasmon
modes has been poorly understood in experiments. Because of the weak chiral
interaction between the chiral structures and OAM light, the structure size had
to be much larger than the incident light wavelength to obtain a sufficient HD
signal in an experiment, resulting in a complex superposition of higher-order
plasmon modes. Recently, we experimentally demonstrated that a twisted gold
nanorod dimer, one of the simplest 3D chiral plasmonic structures, exhibits
giant circular dichroism due to strong plasmon coupling between the nanorods,
followed by the hybridization of dipole mode. In this study, we reveal that the
HD of this nanorod dimer appears due to the hybridization of quadrupole plasmon
mode rather than dipole mode. Furthermore, the measurement of the HD signal can
be achieved by using the array of the twisted dimers. The dependence of the HD
on the incident light wavelength exhibits that the HD sign changes around the
quadrupole plasmon resonance, which is in good agreement with the simulation.
These results open new avenues for the profound understanding of the
light-matter interaction with respect to angular momentum.

generalise Bayesian networks and have been successfully applied to a wide range
of domains. Unlike Bayesian networks, these models can encode context-specific
conditional independencies as well as asymmetric developments within the
evolution of a process. More recently, new model classes belonging to the chain
event graph family have been developed for modelling time-to-event data to
study the temporal dynamics of a process. However, existing model selection
algorithms for chain event graphs and its variants rely on all parameters
having conjugate priors. This is unrealistic for many real-world applications.
In this paper, we propose a mixture modelling approach to model selection in
chain event graphs that does not rely on conjugacy. Moreover, we also show that
this methodology is more amenable to being robustly scaled than the existing
model selection algorithms used for this family. We demonstrate our techniques
on simulated datasets.

necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in
multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning

developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building
energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to
the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies
are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped
with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach
enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate
the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce

the aid of annotated labels. TNN-CCCA is the best audio-visual cross-modal

interference of hard negative samples in representation learning, we propose a
new AV-CMR model to optimize semantic features by directly predicting labels
and then measuring the intrinsic correlation between audio-visual data using
complete cross-triple loss. In particular, our model projects audio-visual
features into label space by minimizing the distance between predicted label
features after feature projection and ground label representations. Moreover,
we adopt complete cross-triplet loss to optimize the predicted label features
by leveraging the relationship between all possible similarity and
dissimilarity semantic information across modalities. The extensive
experimental results on two audio-visual double-checked datasets have shown an
improvement of approximately 2.1% in terms of average MAP over the current
state-of-the-art method TNN-CCCA for the AV-CMR task, which indicates the
effectiveness of our proposed model.

family of relations among references to offer various levels of precision based
on user preferences. This enables us to automatically infer polymorphic
information-flow guards for methods via a co-reachability analysis of a
symbolic finite-state system. We instantiate the heap abstraction with three
different families of relations. We prove the soundness of our approach and

observatory, in the course of its all-sky survey, is expected to detect about
three million active galactic nuclei (AGN) and hundred thousand clusters and
groups of galaxies. Such a sample complemented with redshift information, will
open a new window into the studies of the Large-Scale structure (LSS) of the
Universe and the determination of its cosmological parameters. The purpose of
this work is to assess the prospects of cosmological measurements with the
eROSITA sample of AGN and clusters of galaxies. We assume the availability of
photometric redshift measurements for eROSITA sources and explore the impact of
their quality on our forecasts. We use the redshift-resolved angular power
spectrum of objects. We use a Fisher-matrix formalism and assume flat LambdaCDM
cosmology to forecast the constraining power. We compute the LSS-relevant
characteristics of AGN and clusters in the framework of the halo model and
their X-ray luminosity functions. We find that the accuracy of photometric
redshift estimates has a more profound effect on cosmological measurements than
the fraction of catastrophic errors. Under realistic assumptions about the
photometric redshift quality, the marginalized errors on the cosmological
parameters achieve 1 - 10% accuracy depending on the cosmological priors used
from other experiments. The statistical significance of BAO detection in
angular power spectra of AGN and clusters of galaxies considered individually
achieves 5 - 6 sigma. Our results demonstrate that the eROSITA sample of AGN
and clusters of galaxies used in combination with currently available
photometric redshift estimates will provide cosmological constraints on a par
with dedicated optical LSS surveys.

an (r, z) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of a typical rf-driven axisymmetric

considered magnetic field topology the electron current flows through different
channels in the (r, z) plane: a ``transverse'' one, which involves current flow
through the electrons' magnetic confinement region (EMCR) above the racetrack,
and two ''longitudinal'' ones. Electrons gain energy from the electric field
along these channels following various mechanisms, which are rather distinct
from those sustaining dc-powered magnetrons. The longitudinal power absorption
involves mirror-effect heating (MEH), nonlinear electron resonance heating
(NERH), magnetized bounce heating (MBH), and the heating by the ambipolar field
at the sheath-presheath interface. The MEH and MBH represent two new mechanisms
missing from the previous literature. The MEH is caused by a reversed electric
field needed to overcome the mirror force generated in a nonuniform magnetic
field to ensure sufficient flux of electrons to the powered electrode, and the
MBH is related to a possibility for an electron to undergo multiple reflections
from the expanding sheath in the longitudinal channels connected by the
arc-like magnetic field. The electron heating in the transverse channel is
caused mostly by the essentially collisionless Hall heating in the EMCR above
the racetrack, generating a strong ExB azimuthal drift velocity. The latter
mechanism results in an efficient electron energization, i.e., energy transfer
from the electric field to electrons in the inelastic range. Since the main
electron population energized by this mechanism remains confined within the
discharge for a long time, its contribution to the ionization processes is
dominant.

be used as a safety specification for this domain, so that the system can avoid

inherit a recoil velocity or ``kick'' of crucial implications in, e.g,
black-hole formation scenarios. While the kick magnitude is determined by the
mass ratio and spins of the source, estimating its direction requires a
measurement of the two orientation angles of the source. While the orbital
inclination angle is commonly reported in GW observations, the azimuthal one
has been to date ignored. We show how the presence of more than one GW emission
mode allows constraining this angle and, consequently, determines the kick
direction in a real GW event. %We show that the higher-order mode content
GW190412 enables the determination of both these angles and, consequently, the
kick direction. We analyse the GW190412 signal, which contains higher-order
modes, with a numerical-relativity surrogate waveform model for black-hole
mergers. We find that while GW190412 is barely informative about the kick
magnitude, we can constrain its direction. This forms angles
$\theta_{KL}^{\text{-100M}}=28^{+23}_{-11}\,\deg$ with the orbital angular
momentum defined at a reference time $t_{\rm ref}=-100\,M$ before merger (being

line-of-sight and $\phi_{KN}^{\text{-100M}}=46^{+32}_{-41}\,\deg$ with the

Modern generative models in machine learning can handle learning and
representing probability distribution with high computational efficiency. In
this study, we propose a Fourier-flow generative model to simulate the Feynman
propagator and generate paths for quantum systems. As demonstration, we
validate the path generator on the harmonic and anharmonic oscillators. The
latter is a double-well system without analytic solutions. To preserve the
periodic condition for the system, the Fourier transformation is introduced
into the flow model to approach a Matsubara representation. With this novel
development, the ground-state wave function and low-lying energy levels are
estimated accurately. Our method offers a new avenue to investigate quantum
systems with machine learning assisted Feynman Path integral solving.

direct numerical simulations produce mean magnetic fields, whose saturation
energy density tends to decline with increasing magnetic Reynolds number. This
could imply that the observed large-scale galactic magnetic fields might not
entirely originate from a mean-field dynamo. Much of the current numerical
effort is focused on this unsolved problem. (ii) Small-scale dynamos are
important throughout a galaxy's life, and probably provide strong seed fields

strengths can probably only be explained if helical magnetic fields of small or
moderate length scales can rapidly be ejected or destroyed. (iv) The
circumgalactic medium (CGM) may play an important role in driving dynamo action
at small and large length scales. These interactions between the galactic disk

future research in galactic dynamos to focus on the cosmological history of

model is constructed using the dyadic Green's function, whose characteristics
are leveraged to design two precoding schemes for mitigating the
cross-polarization and inter-user interference contributions. Specifically, a
user-cluster-based precoding scheme assigns different users to one of three
polarizations at the expense of the system's diversity, and a two-layer
precoding scheme removes interference using the Gaussian elimination method at
a high computational cost. The theoretical correlation analysis for HMIMOS in
the NF region is also investigated, revealing that both the spacing of transmit
patch antennas and user distance impact transmit correlation factors. Our
numerical results show that the users far from transmitting HMIMOS experience
higher correlation than those closer within the NF regime, resulting in a lower
channel capacity. Meanwhile, in terms of channel capacity, TP HMIMOS can almost
achieve 1.25 times gain compared with dual-polarized HMIMOS, and 3 times
compared with conventional HMIMOS. In addition, the proposed two-layer
precoding scheme combined with two-layer power allocation realizes a higher
spectral efficiency than other schemes without sacrificing diversity.

quantum linear bosonic networks. We utilize positive-P phase-space simulations

Second, we test the reconstruction quality on variational autoencoders, where
our method reaches the same reconstruction quality as BP. Third, we show that

elevate them above the Galactic mean, or that CR-driven ionisation in the Milky

input-dependent attention matrices with constant ones -- the average attention
weights over multiple inputs. We use PAPA to analyze several established
pretrained Transformers on six downstream tasks. We find that without any

average relative drop of only 8% from the probing baseline. Further, little or
no performance drop is observed when replacing half of the input-dependent
attention matrices with constant (input-independent) ones. Interestingly, we
show that better-performing models lose more from applying our method than

In the absence of exact black hole solutions valid in the whole spacetime, most

of motion, which could provide insights on the full non-linear solutions.
Therefore, the largest part of this chapter is devoted to the linear
approximation. We present results on stationary metric solutions (including
both static and rotating cases) and dynamical spacetimes describing the
formation of non-rotating mini black holes by the collapse of null shells.
Non-local effects can regularize the curvature singularities in both scenarios
and, in the dynamical case, there exists a mass gap below which the formation
of an apparent horizon can be avoided. In the final part we discuss interesting
attempts towards finding non-linear black hole solutions in non-local gravity.
Throughout this chapter, instead of focusing on a particular non-local model,
we present results valid for large classes of theories (to a feasible extent).

experimental study is aimed to address the influence of Ta alloying on the
structure of undercooled (Fe0.75B0.15Si0.1)100-xTax (x=0-2) melts, their
undercoolability and the processes of structure formation during
solidification. Small concentration of Ta complicates standard ab initio and
machine learning investigations. We developed a technique for fast and stable
training of machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) in this case and
uncovered the structure of the undercooled melts. Molecular dynamic simulations
with MLIP showed that at Ta concentration of 1 at.% there is a sharp change in
the chemical short-range ordering in the melt associated with a change in the
interaction of Ta atoms. This effect leads to a restructuring of the cluster
formation in the system. At the same time, our experimental investigation shows
that melts with a Ta content of 1 at.% have the greatest tendency to
undercoolability. Alloying with Ta promotes the formation of primary crystals
of Fe2B, and at a concentration of more than 1.5 at.% Ta, also of FeTaB.
Herewith, near 1 at.% Ta, the crystallization of the melt proceeds
nontrivially: with the formation of two intermediate metastable phases Fe3B and
Fe2Ta Laves phase. Also, the highest tendency to amorphization under conditions
of quick quenching is exhibited by a melt with a Ta concentration of 1 at.%.
The results not only provide understanding of optimal alloying of Fe-B-Si
materials but also promote a machine learning method for numerical design of
metallic alloys with a small dopant concentration.

introduces the data consistency problem. Due to the fundamental tradeoffs among
consistency, availability, and latency in the presence of network partition, no
a one-size-fits-all consistency model exists. To meet the needs of different
applications, many popular data stores provide tunable consistency, allowing
clients to specify the consistency level per individual operation. In this
paper, we propose tunable causal consistency (TCC). It allows clients to choose
the desired session guarantee for each operation, from the well-known four
session guarantees, i.e., read your writes, monotonic reads, monotonic writes,
and writes follow reads. Specifically, we first propose a formal specification
of TCC in an extended (vis,ar) framework originally proposed by Burckhardt et

38ms for all workloads and the throughput is up to about 2800 operations per
second. We also show that TCC achieves better performance than causal
consistency and requires a negligible overhead when compared with eventual

Among the first amino acids absorbed after food intake, they play a major role
in the regulation of protein synthesis and insulin secretion. They are involved
in the modulation of brain uptake of monoamine precursors with which they may
compete for occupancy of a common transporter. In the brain, branched-chain
amino acids are involved not only in protein synthesis but also in the
metabolic cycles of GABA and Glutamate, and in energy metabolism. In
particular, they can affect GABAergic neurons and the excitation/inhibition
balance. Branched-chain amino acids are known for the 24-hour rhythmicity of
their plasma concentrations, which is remarkably conserved in rodent models.
This rhythmicity is partly circadian, independent of sleep and food. Moreover,
their concentration increases when sleep is disturbed and in obesity and
diabetes. The mechanisms regulating these rhythms and their physiological
impact remain poorly understood. In this context, the Drosophila model has not
yet been widely used, but it is highly relevant and the first results indicate

localization of fluorophores along the optical axis of a microscope. GIET is
based on the near-field energy transfer from an optically excited fluorescent
molecule to a single sheet of graphene. It has been successfully used for
estimating inter-leaflet distances of single lipid bilayers, and for
investigating the membrane organization of living mitochondria. In this study,
we use GIET to measure the cholesterol-induced subtle changes of membrane
thickness at the nanoscale. We quantify membrane thickness variations in
supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) as a function of lipid composition and
increasing cholesterol content. Our findings demonstrate that GIET is an
extremely sensitive tool for investigating nanometric structural changes in
bio-membranes.

How should one generate massive amounts of useful data given only an MDP with
no indication of downstream tasks? Are the quantity and quality of data truly
transformative to the performance of a general controller? We propose to answer
both of these questions. First, we introduce a principled unsupervised
exploration method, ChronoGEM, which aims to achieve uniform coverage over the
manifold of achievable states, which we believe is the most reasonable goal
given no prior task information. Secondly, we investigate the effects of both
data quantity and data quality on the training of a downstream goal-achievement

Firstly, two techniques to implement the TRNG in the RRAM crossbar are
presented based on write-back and 50% switching probability pulse. The
randomness of the proposed TRNGs is evaluated using the NIST test suite. Next,
an architecture to implement the PUF in the RRAM crossbar is presented. The
initial entropy source for the PUF is used from TRNGs, and challenge-response

sneak-path current to produce unique CRPs. We demonstrate, through extensive
experiments, reliability of 100%, uniqueness of 47.78%, uniformity of 49.79%,

the challenging low-space regime of the well-known Massive Parallel Computation

that, in this setting, it is possible to deterministically identify connected
components on graphs in $O(\log D + \log\log n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the
diameter of the graph and $n$ the number of nodes. The authors left open a
major question: is it possible to get rid of the additive $\log\log n$ factor
and deterministically identify connected components in a runtime that is
completely independent of $n$?
  We answer the above question in the affirmative in the case of forests. We
give an algorithm that identifies connected components in $O(\log D)$
deterministic rounds. The total memory required is $O(n+m)$ words, where $m$ is
the number of edges in the input graph, which is optimal as it is only enough
to store the input graph. We complement our upper bound results by showing that
$\Omega(\log D)$ time is necessary even for component-unstable algorithms,
conditioned on the widely believed 1 vs. 2 cycles conjecture. Our techniques
also yield a deterministic forest-rooting algorithm with the same runtime and
memory bounds.
  Furthermore, we consider Locally Checkable Labeling problems (LCLs), whose
solution can be verified by checking the $O(1)$-radius neighborhood of each
node. We show that any LCL problem on forests can be solved in $O(\log D)$
rounds with a canonical deterministic algorithm, improving over the $O(\log n)$
runtime of Brandt, Latypov and Uitto [DISC'21]. We also show that there is no

media platforms such as Twitter play an important role in raising public
awareness and spreading knowledge about the dangers of the current climate
crisis. With the increasing number of campaigns and communication about climate
change through social media, the information could create more awareness and
reach the general public and policy makers. However, these Twitter
communications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies,
and often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers.
In this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on
Twitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two
attitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of
Twitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes
toward climate change. Therefore, our work focuses on learning two closely
related tasks: Stance Detection and Sentiment Analysis of climate change
tweets. We propose a multi-task framework that performs stance detection
(primary task) and sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) simultaneously. The
proposed model incorporates the feature-specific and shared-specific attention
frameworks to fuse multiple features and learn the generalized features for
both tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework increases
the performance of the primary task, i.e., stance detection by benefiting from
the auxiliary task, i.e., sentiment analysis compared to its uni-modal and
single-task variants.

Universe. It postulates an early phase of fast, nearly exponential, and
accelerated expansion. Inflationary models are capable of explaining the
overall flatness and homogeneity of today's Universe at large scales. Despite
being widely accepted by the physics community, these models are not absent
from criticism. In scalar field inflation, a necessary condition to begin
inflation is the requirement of a Universe dominated by the field's potential,
which implies a subdominant contribution from the scalar field dynamics. This
has originated to large amounts of scientific debate and literature on the
naturalness, and possible fine-tuning of the initial conditions for inflation.
Another controversial issue concerns the end of inflation, and the fact that a
preheating mechanism is necessary to originate the hot big bang plasma after
inflation.
  In this thesis, we present full general relativistic simulations to study
these two problems, with a particular focus on the Starobinsky and Higgs models
of inflation. First, we consider the fine-tuning problem of beginning inflation
from a highly dynamical and inhomogeneous ""preinflation"" epoch in the
single-field case. In our second study, we approach the multifield paradigm of
preinflation, together and consistently, with the preheating phase. These
investigations confirm the robustness of these inflationary models to generic
initial conditions, while putting in evidence the non-negligible gravitational
effects during preheating. At the end of the manuscript, we discuss potential
applications of numerical simulations in cosmology, including our preliminary
investigations on primordial black hole formation.

$\gamma$ is tuned to its critical value $\gamma_c$. We further demonstrate the
transition through the analytical calculation of the operator size distribution
in a solvable Brownian SYK model. Our results show that: (i) For
$\gamma>\gamma_c$, the system is in a dissipative phase where the system
operator size decays with a rate $\sim (\gamma-\gamma_c)$, which indicates the
initial information of the system all dives into the bath eventually. (ii) For
$\gamma<\gamma_c$, the system sustains a scrambling phase, where the average
operator size grows exponentially up to the scrambling time $t_s\sim
(\gamma_c-\gamma)^{-1}\log N$ and saturates to a $O(N)$ value in the long-time

  Shift Modeling","Accepted at CLeaR (Causal Learning and Reasoning) 2023",,,,"q-bio.GN cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Latent variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) have become
a go-to tool for analyzing biological data, especially in the field of
single-cell genomics. One remaining challenge is the interpretability of latent
variables as biological processes that define a cell's identity. Outside of
biological applications, this problem is commonly referred to as learning
disentangled representations. Although several disentanglement-promoting
variants of the VAE were introduced, and applied to single-cell genomics data,
this task has been shown to be infeasible from independent and identically
distributed measurements, without additional structure. Instead, recent methods
propose to leverage non-stationary data, as well as the sparse mechanism shift
assumption in order to learn disentangled representations with a causal
semantic. Here, we extend the application of these methodological advances to
the analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical
perturbations. More precisely, we propose a deep generative model of
single-cell gene expression data for which each perturbation is treated as a
stochastic intervention targeting an unknown, but sparse, subset of latent
variables. We benchmark these methods on simulated single-cell data to evaluate
their performance at latent units recovery, causal target identification and
out-of-domain generalization. Finally, we apply those approaches to two
real-world large-scale gene perturbation data sets and find that models that
exploit the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis surpass contemporary methods on a
transfer learning task. We implement our new model and benchmarks using the
scvi-tools library, and release it as open-source software at

statistical analysis of the lopsided morphology of 1780 isolated satellite
galaxies generated by TNG50-1 simulation, incorporating the effect of tidal
fields from halo centres. We analyse the lopsided shapes of the satellites in
the hemispheres between backwards (far side) and facing (near side) the halo
centres in radial ranges of $0$-$2{\rm R_{\rm h}}$, $2$-$5{\rm R_{\rm h}}$ and
$5$-$10{\rm R_{\rm h}}$ with ${\rm R_{\rm h}}$ being the stellar half mass
radius. In all the radial bins of the satellites, the numbers of satellites
with longer semi-axes on the far side are found to be almost equal to those
with longer semi-axes on the near side. Therefore, the tidal fields from halo
centres play a minor role in the generation of lopsided satellites. Moreover,
we study the radial alignment (RA) between the major axes of satellites and the
radial direction of their halo centres in the above radial ranges. The
existence of RA is highly controversial in observations. Our results confirm
that RA is absent in the TNG50-1 satellite galaxies. An alignment between the
long semi-major-axes of satellite galaxies and the radial directions to their

further explored. No clear evidence of LRA is found in our sample of satellite

which search-based approaches have proven to be effective. At the core of the
search-based approaches lies the design of the cost model. Though deep
learning-based cost models perform significantly better than other methods,
they still fall short and suffer from the following problems. First, their
feature extraction heavily relies on expert-level domain knowledge in hardware
architectures. Even so, the extracted features are often unsatisfactory and
require separate considerations for CPUs and GPUs. Second, a cost model trained
on one hardware platform usually performs poorly on another, a problem we call
cross-hardware unavailability.
  In order to address these problems, we propose TLP and MTLTLP. TLP is a deep
learning-based cost model that facilitates tensor program tuning. Instead of
extracting features from the tensor program itself, TLP extracts features from
the schedule primitives. We treat schedule primitives as tensor languages. TLP
is thus a Tensor Language Processing task. In this way, the task of predicting
the tensor program latency through the cost model is transformed into a natural
language processing (NLP) regression task. MTL-TLP combines Multi-Task Learning
and TLP to cope with the cross-hardware unavailability problem.
  We incorporate these techniques into the Ansor framework and conduct detailed
experiments. Results show that TLP can speed up the average search time by 9.1X
and 3.0X on CPU and GPU workloads, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art implementation. MTL-TLP can achieve a speed-up of 4.7X and

leptonic and lepto-hadronic, which both succeed fairly well in describing the

intrinsic randomness of quantum theory. Operationally, this stochasticity is
modelled through classical or quantum correlations with an eavesdropper, Eve,
whose goal is to make the best guess about the outcomes produced in the
experiment. In this work, we study Eve's maximum guessing probability when she
is allowed to have correlations with, both, the state and the measurement. We
show that, unlike the case of projective measurements (as it was already known)
or pure states (as we prove), in the setting of generalized measurements and
mixed states, Eve's guessing probability differs depending on whether she can
prepare classically or quantumly correlated strategies.

structure consisting of several radio frequency (RF) chains and abundant
antenna elements in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Due to
conventional costly full connections, we design an enhanced partially-connected
beamformer employing low-density parity-check (LDPC) based structure. As a
benefit of LDPC-based structure, information can be exchanged among clustered
RF/antenna groups, which results in a low computational complexity order.
Advanced message passing (MP) capable of inferring and transferring information
among different paths is designed to support LDPC-based hybrid beamformer. We
propose a message passing enhanced antenna and RF chain selection (MARS) scheme
to minimize the operational power of antennas and RF chains of the receiver.
Furthermore, sequential and parallel MP for MARS are respectively designed as
MARS-S and MARS-P schemes to address convergence speed issue. Simulations have
validated the convergence of both the MARS-P and the MARS-S algorithms. Owing
to asynchronous information transfer of MARS-P, it reveals that higher power is
required than that of MARS-S, which strikes a compelling balance between power
consumption, convergence, and computational complexity. It is also demonstrated
that the proposed MARS scheme outperforms the existing benchmarks using
heuristic method of fully-/partially-connected architectures in open literature
in terms of the lowest power and highest energy efficiency.

vortex sheets, in incompressible fluid flows. We study the Birkhoff-Rott
equation, which describes the motion of vortex sheets according to the
incompressible Euler equations in two dimensions. The classical
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability demonstrates that an infinite, flat vortex sheet
has a strong linear instability. We show that this is not the case for circular
vortex sheets: such a configuration has a delicate linear stability, and is the
first example of a linearly stable solution to the Birkhoff-Rott equation. We
subsequently derive a sufficient condition for linear instability of a circular
vortex sheet for a family of generalized Birkhoff-Rott kernels, and prove that
a common regularized kernel used in numerical simulation and analysis
destabilizes the circular vortex sheet. Absent a destabilizing kernel
regularization, our work suggests that the nonlinear dynamics are critical for
understanding circular vortex sheet instability, and so the essential mechanism
of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is dependent on global vortex sheet
geometry. As expected, nonlinear numerical simulations utilizing the
regularized kernel exhibit unstable behavior. Finally, we show experimental
results which qualitatively match the types of instabilities that are observed
numerically, demonstrating the persistence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
in real circular shear flows.

Vilasini and R. Colbeck in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022) and PRL, 129, 110401 (2022)
for connecting these notions, where the possibility of operationally detectable
causal loops embedded in (1+1)-Minkowski spacetime without superluminal
signalling was demonstrated. In the first part, we take the
information-theoretic point of view, where the concept of higher-order (HO)
affects relations was proposed to generically model signalling in the presence
of cyclic, fine-tuned and non-classical causal influences. We establish new
properties of HO affects relations and apply them to infer causal structures.
We then demonstrate a complete and constructive way to detect causal loops from
a set of HO affects relations. In the second part, we study the embedding of
information-theoretic causal structures into partially ordered spacetimes. We
propose stability conditions on the spacetime embedding to rule out a class of
operationally detectable loops that cannot be ruled out by the principle of
no-signalling (outside the relativistic future) alone. We then propose novel
order-theoretic properties that we conjecture to hold in Minkowski spacetime
with $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. This would imply that in contrast to
(1+1)-Minkowski spacetime, in higher dimensions, the no-signalling principle is
indeed sufficient for ruling out this class of loops. Finally, we introduce a
relation which allows for causal inference through knowledge about the absence
of signalling relations and we relate it to novel order-theoretic features of

solution is directly connected to the quantum effective action for the metric

is invariant under general coordinate transformations. Solving the cosmological
field equations derived by variation of the quantum effective action provides
for a detailed quantitative description of the evolution of the universe. The
\qq{beginning state} of the universe is found close to an ultraviolet fixed
point of the flow equation. It can be described by an inflationary epoch, with
approximate scale invariance of the observed primordial fluctuation spectrum
explained by approximate quantum scale symmetry. Overall cosmology realizes a
dynamical crossover from the ultraviolet fixed point to an infrared fixed point
which is approached in the infinite future. Present cosmology is close to the
infrared fixed point. It features dynamical dark energy mediated by a light
scalar field. The tiny mass of this cosmon arises from its role as a pseudo
Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken quantum scale symmetry. The extremely
small value of the present dark energy density in Planck units results
dynamically as a consequence of the huge age of the universe. The cosmological

estimates yield no regularity loss and are uniform in Mach number. Also, they
are uniform in surface tension coefficient if the Rayleigh-Taylor sign
condition holds initially. We can thus simultaneously obtain incompressible and
vanishing-surface-tension limits. The method developed in this paper is a
unified and robust hyperbolic approach to free-boundary problems in
compressible Euler equations. It can be applied to some important complex fluid
models as it relies on neither parabolic regularization nor irrotational
assumption. This paper joined with our previous works [45,46] rigorously proves
the local well-posedness and the incompressible limit for a compressible
gravity water wave with or without surface tension.

introduce a new heavy-tailed frequency model -- the two-parameter ZY

and the heavy-tailed two-parameter Waring distribution. Finally, we pursue
natural extensions of both the ZY and Waring families to a unifying,
four-parameter heavy-tailed model, providing the foundation for a novel
loss-frequency modeling approach to complement conventional GLM analyses. This
approach is illustrated by application to a classic set of Swedish commercial

numbers between $180$ and $10^{10}$. The three models have ''seen'' flows at
only a few Reynolds numbers. We test if these ML wall models can extrapolate to
unseen Reynolds numbers. Among the three models, two are supervised ML models,
and one is a reinforcement learning ML model. The two supervised ML models are
trained against direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, whereas the
reinforcement learning ML model is trained in the context of a wall-modeled LES
with no access to high-fidelity data. The two supervised ML models capture the
law of the wall at both seen and unseen Reynolds numbers--although one model
requires re-training and predicts a smaller von K\'arm\'an constant. The

has errors at both low ($Re_\tau<10^3$) and high Reynolds numbers

''understand'' why the ML models behave the way they behave. Analysis shows
that the errors of the supervised ML model is a result of the network design

character endows the plasmons with extremely strong anisotropy. There exist
both intraband and interband plasmon branches. The intraband branch is gapless
and has a $q^{1/2}$ dispersion. It is most dispersive and is independent of
carrier density in direction normal to the nodal line, whereas along the nodal
line, its dispersion is largely suppressed and its frequency scales linearly
with carrier density. The interband branches are gapped and their long
wavelength limits are connected with van Hove singularities of the band
structure. We find that the single particle excitations are strongly suppressed
in such systems, which decreases the Landau damping of plasmons. These
characters are further verified by first-principles calculations on 2D

access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI's codex-davinci-002 model wrote
significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally,
participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they
wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore,
we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the
language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature)
provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better

which, however, are slow and inefficient in conventional digital computers,
thus requiring a radical paradigm shift to achieve fast, real-time solutions.
Here, for the first time, we apply the emerging analog matrix computing (AMC)
to the linear precoding of massive MIMO. The real-valued AMC concept is
extended to process complex-valued signals. In order to adapt the MIMO channel
models to RRAM conductance mapping, a new matrix inversion circuit is
developed. In addition, fully analog dataflow and optimized operational

results show that the zero-forcing precoding is solved within 20 ns for a
16x128 MIMO system, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the
conventional digital approach. Meanwhile, the energy efficiency is improved by
50x.

trained on large fully-labeled image datasets. However, the domain shift
typically associated with diverse operational capture conditions (e.g., camera
viewpoints and lighting) may translate to a significant decline in performance.
This paper focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for video-based ReID
- a relevant scenario that is less explored in the literature. In this
scenario, the ReID model must adapt to a complex target domain defined by a
network of diverse video cameras based on tracklet information. State-of-art
methods cluster unlabeled target data, yet domain shifts across target cameras
(sub-domains) can lead to poor initialization of clustering methods that
propagates noise across epochs, thus preventing the ReID model to accurately
associate samples of same identity. In this paper, an UDA method is introduced
for video person ReID that leverages knowledge on video tracklets, and on the
distribution of frames captured over target cameras to improve the performance
of CNN backbones trained using pseudo-labels. Our method relies on an
adversarial approach, where a camera-discriminator network is introduced to
extract discriminant camera-independent representations, facilitating the
subsequent clustering. In addition, a weighted contrastive loss is proposed to
leverage the confidence of clusters, and mitigate the risk of incorrect
identity associations. Experimental results obtained on three challenging
video-based person ReID datasets - PRID2011, iLIDS-VID, and MARS - indicate
that our proposed method can outperform related state-of-the-art methods. Our

address this min-max approach by employing one network to seek the trial

overcome this, we reformulate the residual minimization as an equivalent
minimization of a Ritz functional fed by optimal test functions computed from
another Ritz functional minimization. We call the resulting scheme the Deep
Double Ritz Method (D$^2$RM), which combines two neural networks for
approximating trial functions and optimal test functions along a nested double

when the evidence for a certain decision is dubious. The investigation of a
deep learning model output is pivotal for understanding its decision processes
and assessing its capabilities and limitations. By analyzing the distributions
of raw network output vectors, it can be observed that each class has its own
decision boundary and, thus, the same raw output value has different support
for different classes. Inspired by this fact, we have developed a new method
for out-of-distribution detection. The method offers an explanatory step beyond
simple thresholding of the softmax output towards understanding and
interpretation of the model learning process and its output. Instead of
assigning the class label of the highest logit to each new sample presented to
the network, it takes the distributions over all classes into consideration. A
probability score interpreter (PSI) is created based on the joint logit values
in relation to their respective correct vs wrong class distributions. The PSI
suggests whether the sample is likely to belong to a specific class, whether
the network is unsure, or whether the sample is likely an outlier or unknown
type for the network. The simple PSI has the benefit of being applicable on
already trained networks. The distributions for correct vs wrong class for each

complement the Gaia spectrophotometry with additional photometry in order to
characterise its global properties. This includes the inference of the
distances, their locus in the Gaia colour-absolute magnitude diagram and the
(biased through selection) luminosity function in the faint end of the Main
Sequence. We study the overall changes in the Gaia RP spectra as a function of
spectral type. We study the UCDs in binary systems, attempt to identify
low-mass members of nearby young associations, star forming regions and
clusters, and analyse their variability properties. Results. We detect 57
young, kinematically homogeneous groups some of which are identified as well
known star forming regions, associations and clusters of different ages. We
find that the primary members of 880 binary systems with a UCD belong mainly to
the thin and thick disk components of the Milky Way. We identify 1109 variable
UCDs using the variability tables in the Gaia archive, 728 of which belong to
the star forming regions defined by HMAC. We define two groups of variable UCDs
with extreme bright or faint outliers. Conclusions. The set of sources
identified as UCDs in the Gaia archive contains a wealth of information that
will require focused follow-up studies and observations. It will help to
advance our understanding of the nature of the faint end of the Main Sequence
and the stellar/substellar transition.

the $k$-color Ramsey number and list Ramsey number of $H$, respectively.
Motivated by the work of Alon, Buci\'c, Kalvari, Kuperwasser and Szab\'o, who
initiated the systematic study of list Ramsey numbers of graphs and
hypergraphs, and conjectured that $ r(K_{1,n};k)$ and $r_\ell(K_{1,n};k)$ are
always equal, we study the $k$-color Ramsey number for double stars $S(n,m)$,
where $n\ge m\ge1$. To the best of our knowledge, little is known on the exact
value of $r(S(n,m);k)$ when $k\ge3$. A classic result of Erd\H{o}s and Graham
from 1975 asserts that $r(T;k)>k(n-1)+1$ for every tree $T$ with $n\ge 1$ edges
and $k$ sufficiently large such that $n$ divides $k-1$. Using a folklore double
counting argument in set system and the edge chromatic number of complete
graphs, we prove that if $k$ is odd and $n$ is sufficiently large compared with
$m$ and $k$, then \[ r(S(n,m);k)=kn+m+2.\] This is a step in our effort to
determine whether $r(S(n,m);k)$ and $r_\ell(S(n,m);k)$ are always equal, which
remains wide open. We also prove that $ r(S^m_n;k)=k(n-1)+m+2$ if $k $ is odd
and $n$ is sufficiently large compared with $m$ and $k$, where $1\le m\le n$
and $S^m_n$ is obtained from $K_{1, n}$ by subdividing $m$ edges each exactly
once. We end the paper with some observations towards the list Ramsey number
for $S(n,m)$ and $S^m_n$.

conduct fully coupled 3D numerical simulations of wave propagation in the solid

Utilizing recent computational advances and the open-source software SeisSol,

the so-called ""likelihood trap"", resulting in generated responses which are
dull, repetitive, and often inconsistent with dialogue history. Comparing
ranked lists of multiple generated responses against the ""gold response"" (from
evaluation data) reveals a wide diversity in response quality, with many good
responses placed lower in the ranked list. The main challenge, addressed in
this work, is then how to reach beyond greedily generated system responses,
that is, how to obtain and select such high-quality responses from the list of
overgenerated responses at inference without availability of the gold response.
To this end, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method which aims to
select high-quality items from the lists of responses initially overgenerated
by the system. The idea is to use any sequence-level (similarity) scoring
function to divide the semantic space of responses into high-scoring versus
low-scoring partitions. At training, the high-scoring partition comprises all
generated responses whose similarity to the gold response is higher than the
similarity of the greedy response to the gold response. At inference, the aim
is to estimate the probability that each overgenerated response belongs to the
high-scoring partition, given only previous dialogue history. We validate the
robustness and versatility of our proposed method on the standard MultiWOZ

is subject to a set of illumination patterns and the total interaction of the
object, e.g., reflected or transmitted photons or particles, is measured for
each pattern with a single-pixel or bucket detector. An image of the object is
then computed through the correlation of each pattern and the corresponding
bucket value. Assuming no prior knowledge of the object, the set of patterns
used to compute the ghost image dictates the image quality. In the
visible-light regime, programmable spatial light modulators can generate the
illumination patterns. In many other regimes -- such as x rays, electrons, and
neutrons -- no such dynamically configurable modulators exist, and patterns are
commonly produced by employing a transversely-translated mask. In this paper we

seeks answers to the following question: how do we build successful learning
algorithms when the data available for training our model is qualitatively
different from the data we hope the model will perform well on? In this thesis,
we focus on a specific area of Transfer Learning called label shift, also known
as quantification. In quantification, the aforementioned discrepancy is
isolated to a shift in the distribution of the response variable. In such a
setting, accurately inferring the response variable's new distribution is both
an important estimation task in its own right and a crucial step for ensuring
that the learning algorithm can adapt to the new data. We make two
contributions to this field. First, we present a new procedure called SELSE
which estimates the shift in the response variable's distribution. Second, we
prove that SELSE is semiparametric efficient among a large family of
quantification algorithms, i.e., SELSE's normalized error has the smallest
possible asymptotic variance matrix compared to any other algorithm in that
family. This family includes nearly all existing algorithms, including ACC/PACC
quantifiers and maximum likelihood based quantifiers such as EMQ and MLLS.
Empirical experiments reveal that SELSE is competitive with, and in many cases
outperforms, existing state-of-the-art quantification methods, and that this
improvement is especially large when the number of test samples is far greater

Scratch projects, trained and evaluated on human expert creativity assessments
in an extensive user study. Our results show that opinions about creativity in
Scratch varied widely across experts. The automatic creativity assessment
aligned with the assessment of the human experts more than the experts agreed
with each other. This is a first step in providing computational models for
measuring creativity that can be applied to educational technologies, and to
scale up the benefit of creativity education in schools.

  https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/DeepDG",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple
training domains such that it can perform well on unseen target domains. A
popular strategy is to augment training data to benefit generalization through
methods such as Mixup~\cite{zhang2018mixup}. While the vanilla Mixup can be
directly applied, theoretical and empirical investigations uncover several
shortcomings that limit its performance. Firstly, Mixup cannot effectively
identify the domain and class information that can be used for learning
invariant representations. Secondly, Mixup may introduce synthetic noisy data
points via random interpolation, which lowers its discrimination capability.
Based on the analysis, we propose a simple yet effective enhancement for
Mixup-based DG, namely domain-invariant Feature mIXup (FIX). It learns
domain-invariant representations for Mixup. To further enhance discrimination,
we leverage existing techniques to enlarge margins among classes to further
propose the domain-invariant Feature MIXup with Enhanced Discrimination (FIXED)
approach. We present theoretical insights about guarantees on its
effectiveness. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets across two
modalities including image classification (Digits-DG, PACS, Office-Home) and
time series (DSADS, PAMAP2, UCI-HAR, and USC-HAD) demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art related methods, beating the
best performing baseline by 6.5\% on average in terms of test accuracy.

real-world unsupervised adaptation. Contrary to Sagawa et al., we show that it

the mechanism of brain function, many studies are being actively conducted on
the structure of functional neuronal ensemble and hub, including all areas of
neuroscience. In addition, recent study suggests that the existence of
functional neuronal ensembles and hubs contributes to the efficiency of
information processing. For these reasons, there is a demand for methods to
infer functional neuronal ensembles from neuronal activity data, and methods
based on Bayesian inference have been proposed. However, there is a problem in
modeling the activity in Bayesian inference. The features of each neuron's
activity have non-stationarity depending on physiological experimental
conditions. As a result, the assumption of stationarity in Bayesian inference
model impedes inference, which leads to destabilization of inference results
and degradation of inference accuracy. In this study, we extend the range of
the variable for expressing the neuronal state, and generalize the likelihood
of the model for extended variables. By comparing with the previous study, our
model can express the neuronal state in larger space. This generalization
without restriction of the binary input enables us to perform soft clustering
and apply the method to non-stationary neuroactivity data. In addition, for the
effectiveness of the method, we apply the developed method to multiple

manifold interpolation scheme, for use in an offline-online setting, where
offline excitation-response data, taken at specific model parameter instances,

FWI for high resolution seismic imaging, this technique is a nonlinear
optimization and may be trapped into local minima. Wavefield reconstruction
inversion (WRI) relaxes the condition that the wave equation associated with a
true physical source does need to be accurately satisfied during the iteration
process. Alternatively, extended source waveform inversion (ESI) introduces a
non-physical source deployed into the whole computing domain for matching the
observed data by synthetic data. The iterative process will move this extended
source to the physical source. WRI and ESI are formulated within the same
mathematical framework using Lagrangian-based adjoint-state method with a
special focus on time-domain formulation using extended sources, while putting
connections between classical FWI, WRI and ESI: both WRI and ESI can be viewed
as weighted versions of classic FWI. Due to symmetric positive definite
Hessian, the conjugate gradient is explored to efficiently solve the normal
equation in a matrix free manner, while both time and frequency domain wave
equation solvers are feasible. The most significant challenge comes from the
huge storage demand to store time-domain wavefields through iterations. We
describe two possible workaround strategies by extracting sparse frequencial
wavefields or by considering time-domain data instead of wavefields for
reducing such challenge. We suggest that these options should be explored more
intensively for tractable workflows.
