speech enhancement, causal PSE models may occasionally remove the target speech
by mistake. The PSE models also tend to leak interfering speech when the target
speaker is silent for an extended period. We show that existing PSE methods
suffer from a trade-off between speech over-suppression and interference
leakage by addressing one problem at the expense of the other. We propose a new
PSE model training framework using cross-task knowledge distillation to
mitigate this trade-off. Specifically, we utilize a personalized voice activity
detector (pVAD) during training to exclude the non-target speech frames that
are wrongly identified as containing the target speaker with hard or soft
classification. This prevents the PSE model from being too aggressive while
still allowing the model to learn to suppress the input speech when it is
likely to be spoken by interfering speakers. Comprehensive evaluation results
are presented, covering various PSE usage scenarios.

frequency drop in the grid by disconnecting part of the demand. The allocation
methods for selecting feeders that would contribute to the UFLS scheme have
traditionally relied on the fact that electric demand followed fairly regular
patterns, and could be forecast with high accuracy. However, recent integration
of Distributed Generation (DG) increases the uncertainty in net consumption of
feeders which, in turn, requires a reformulation of UFLS-allocation methods to
account for this uncertainty. In this paper, a chance-constrained methodology
for selecting feeders is proposed, with mathematical guarantees for the
disconnection of the required amount of load with a certain pre-defined
probability. The correlation in net-load forecasts among feeders is explicitly
considered, given that uncertainty in DG power output is driven by
meteorological conditions with high correlation across the network.
Furthermore, this method is applicable either to systems with conventional UFLS
schemes (where relays measure local frequency and trip if this magnitude falls
below a certain threshold), or adaptive UFLS schemes (where relays are
triggered by control signals sent in the few instants following a contingency).
Relevant case studies demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, and

large scale expensive human-annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL)
is a popular technique for reducing the reliance on human annotation by
leveraging unlabeled data for training. However, despite its substantial
success on single sentence classification tasks where the challenge in making
use of unlabeled data is to assign ""good enough"" pseudo-labels, for NLI tasks,
the nature of unlabeled data is more complex: one of the sentences in the pair

populations of dynamical systems, has demonstrated great potential in numerous
scientific and practical applications. Striking examples include pulse design
for exciting spin ensembles in quantum physics, neurostimulation for relieving
neurological disorder symptoms, and path planning for steering robot swarms.
However, the control targets in such applications are generally large-scale
complex and severely underactuated ensemble systems, research into which
stretches the capability of techniques in classical control and dynamical
systems theory to the very limit. This paper then devotes to advancing our
knowledge about controllability of linear ensemble systems by integrating tools
in modern algebra into the technique of separating points developed in our
recent work. In particular, we give an algebraic interpretation of the dynamics
of linear systems in terms of actions of polynomials on vector spaces, and this
leads to the development of the functional canonical form of matrix-valued
functions, which can also be viewed as the generalization of the rational
canonical form of matrices in linear algebra. Then, leveraging the technique of
separating points, we achieve a necessary and sufficient characterization of
uniform ensemble controllability for time-invariant linear ensemble systems as
the ensemble controllability canonical form, in which the system and control
matrices are in the functional canonical and block diagonal form, respectively.

finite-dimensional methods to tackle control problems involving
infinite-dimensional ensemble systems, and lays a solid foundation for a more
inclusive ensemble control theory targeting a much broader spectrum of control

On the other hand, the accuracy of supervised machine learning models is
strongly related to the quality of the labelled data on which they train, and
automatic sentiment labelling techniques could reduce the time and cost of
human labelling. We have compared three automatic sentiment labelling
techniques: TextBlob, Vader, and Afinn to assign sentiments to tweets without
any human assistance. We compare three scenarios: one uses training and testing
datasets with existing ground truth labels; the second experiment uses
automatic labels as training and testing datasets; and the third experiment
uses three automatic labelling techniques to label the training dataset and
uses the ground truth labels for testing. The experiments were evaluated on two
Twitter datasets: SemEval-2013 (DS-1) and SemEval-2016 (DS-2). Results show
that the Afinn labelling technique obtains the highest accuracy of 80.17%

imply that automatic text labelling could provide significant benefits, and
suggest a feasible alternative to the time and cost of human labelling efforts.

stability of Cu$_{3}$Au from -0.0343 eV-atom$^{-1}$ to -0.0682 eV-atom$^{-1}$.
We use DFT-based linear-response theory to predict SRO and its electronic

construct a correlation tensor. A double singular value decomposition of the
correlation tensors gives its singular values. The significance of the singular

singular values shows a distinctive behavior. The largest singular value shows
a significant negative correlation with XRP/USD price. We observe the minimum
of the largest singular values at the XRP/USD price peak during the first week

is explained by decomposing the correlation tensor in the signal and noise

presence of large-scale labelled datasets, which are extremely expensive and
time-consuming to annotate. This paper focuses on tackling semi-supervised part
segmentation tasks by generating high-quality images with a pre-trained GAN and
labelling the generated images with an automatic annotator. In particular, we
formulate the annotator learning as a learning-to-learn problem. Given a
pre-trained GAN, the annotator learns to label object parts in a set of
randomly generated images such that a part segmentation model trained on these
synthetic images with their predicted labels obtains low segmentation error on
a small validation set of manually labelled images. We further reduce this
nested-loop optimization problem to a simple gradient matching problem and
efficiently solve it with an iterative algorithm. We show that our method can
learn annotators from a broad range of labelled images including real images,
generated images, and even analytically rendered images. Our method is
evaluated with semi-supervised part segmentation tasks and significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised competitors when the amount of labelled

  Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems",,,,"cs.RO cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Proper functioning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for
the safety and efficiency of future intelligent transport systems. Meanwhile,
transitioning to fully autonomous driving requires a long period of mixed
autonomy traffic, including both CAVs and human-driven vehicles. Thus,
collaboration decision-making for CAVs is essential to generate appropriate
driving behaviors to enhance the safety and efficiency of mixed autonomy
traffic. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely
used in solving decision-making problems. However, the existing DRL-based
methods have been mainly focused on solving the decision-making of a single
CAV. Using the existing DRL-based methods in mixed autonomy traffic cannot
accurately represent the mutual effects of vehicles and model dynamic traffic
environments. To address these shortcomings, this article proposes a graph
reinforcement learning (GRL) approach for multi-agent decision-making of CAVs
in mixed autonomy traffic. First, a generic and modular GRL framework is
designed. Then, a systematic review of DRL and GRL methods is presented,
focusing on the problems addressed in recent research. Moreover, a comparative
study on different GRL methods is further proposed based on the designed
framework to verify the effectiveness of GRL methods. Results show that the GRL
methods can well optimize the performance of multi-agent decision-making for
CAVs in mixed autonomy traffic compared to the DRL methods. Finally, challenges
and future research directions are summarized. This study can provide a
valuable research reference for solving the multi-agent decision-making
problems of CAVs in mixed autonomy traffic and can promote the implementation

Depending on the coupling strength, there exist three phases: disordered
paramagnetic phase, ferromagnetic phase, and frustrated antiferromagnetic
phase, which can be distinguished by the mean-field approach. The
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition is accompanied by the breaking of
the global $Z_2$ symmetry, whereas the paramagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase
transition is accompanied by the breaking of both the global $Z_2$ symmetry and
the translational symmetry. Exact analytical results of higher-order quantum
effects beyond the mean-field contribution, such as the excitation energy,
quantum fluctuation, and von Neumann entropy, can be achieved by the
Holstein-Primakoff transformation and symplectic transformation in the
thermodynamic limit. Near the quantum critical point, the energy gap closes,
along with the divergence of the quantum fluctuation in certain quadrature and
von Neumann entropy. Particular attention should be paid to the
antiferromagnetic phase, where geometric frustration takes effect. The critical
behaviors in the antiferromagnetic phase are quite different from those in the
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, which highlight the importance of
geometric frustration. The triangular coupled-top model provides a simple and
feasible platform to study the quantum phase transition and the novel critical

to the blue to near-infrared spectral regions, even in developed commercial
sources. The output spectra of these sources are missing short wavelengths of
the full range. Many efforts have been spent to break the limitation. Among
them, dispersive-wave (DW) generation has been investigated for triggering new
frequencies in short wavelengths. With satisfied phase-matching conditions,
excessive energy can be directly transferred from solitons of the anomalous
dispersion region to DWs of the short wavelengths. However, a systematical
study of factors, including phase-matched DWs, strongly related to the
dispersion tailoring of higher-order modes (HOMs), has rarely been shown. This
study reports the experimental observations of HOM-enhanced phase-matchings for
the DW generation in the deep-blue and ultraviolet regions. A solid-core

sampling is first proposed to be based on the depth data which can identify and
eliminate a specific type of in-collision trajectories in the sampled motion
primitive library. More specifically, all the obscured primitives' endpoints
are found through querying the depth values and excluded from the sampled set,
which can significantly reduce the computational workload required in collision
checking. On the other hand, we furthermore propose a steering mechanism also
based on the depth information to effectively prevent an autonomous vehicle
from getting stuck when facing a large convex obstacle, providing a higher
level of autonomy for a planning system. Our steering technique is
theoretically proved to be complete in scenarios of convex obstacles. To
evaluate effectiveness of the proposed DEpth based both Sampling and Steering

difficult to estimate as the outcome survival function itself. Here, we employ
a decomposition of the conditional survival function in terms of observable

application of an array of flexible regression and classification methods
rather than only approaches that explicitly handle the complexities inherent to
survival data. We outline estimation procedures based on this decomposition,

better accurate confidence estimates on given examples. However, little is
known about if model explanations can help confidence calibration. Intuitively,
humans look at important features attributions and decide whether the model is
trustworthy. Similarly, the explanations can tell us when the model may or may
not know. Inspired by this, we propose a method named CME that leverages model
explanations to make the model less confident with non-inductive attributions.
The idea is that when the model is not highly confident, it is difficult to
identify strong indications of any class, and the tokens accordingly do not
have high attribution scores for any class and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on six datasets with two popular pre-trained language models in the
in-domain and out-of-domain settings. The results show that CME improves
calibration performance in all settings. The expected calibration errors are
further reduced when combined with temperature scaling. Our findings highlight
that model explanations can help calibrate posterior estimates.

confirmed and fits very well with theory and micromagnetic simulations, having
the form of a flapping mode at the extrema of the nanodot in one of the
in-plane directions. Its frequency is below the fundamental mode's frequency

localized SSW modes. Higher order SSW modes can be generated from the theory,

quantized ZBP in the nanowire, we propose a scheme wherein the length of the
topological region in the wire is altered. The tunneling conductance signatures
can then be utilized to gauge the impact on the energy of the low-energy

our protocol, in particular, the topological ZBP remains robust at zero bias

their separable nature, allowing us to distinguish between topological and

In regression analysis, outliers can usually be divided into high leverage

they have several drawbacks on modeling the realistic degradation: information
over-preservation, color bias and possible artifacts, making the trained
reconstruction networks hard to generalize well to real-world cases. To solve
this problem, we propose a learning-based data synthesis approach to learn the
properties of real-world SDRTVs by integrating several tone mapping priors into

discusses the method of modal logic based on ""possible worlds"" and discusses a

to probability. The relationship between possibility and probability is
explored for general probability spaces and for refinements of these spaces
conditional on other events, with particular focus on the properties of events

textual data instance such as a post or a comment into a stance class of a
target issue, has become an emerging opinion mining paradigm of importance. An
example application would be to overcome vaccine hesitancy in combating the
coronavirus pandemic. However, existing stance detection strategies rely merely
on the individual instances which cannot always capture the expressed stance of
a given target. In response, we address a new task called conversational stance
detection which is to infer the stance towards a given target (e.g., COVID-19
vaccination) when given a data instance and its corresponding conversation
thread. To tackle the task, we first propose a benchmarking conversational
stance detection (CSD) dataset with annotations of stances and the structures
of conversation threads among the instances based on six major social media
platforms in Hong Kong. To infer the desired stances from both data instances
and conversation threads, we propose a model called Branch-BERT that
incorporates contextual information in conversation threads. Extensive
experiments on our CSD dataset show that our proposed model outperforms all the
baseline models that do not make use of contextual information. Specifically,
it improves the F1 score by 10.3% compared with the state-of-the-art method in
the SemEval-2016 Task 6 competition. This shows the potential of incorporating
rich contextual information on detecting target-specific stances on social
media platforms and implies a more practical way to construct future stance
detection tasks.

accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of myocardial infarction. However,
achieving this segmentation is challenging, mainly due to the inadequate and
indistinct information from an image. In this work, we develop an end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as MyoPS-Net, to flexibly combine
five-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images for MyoPS. To extract
precise and adequate information, we design an effective yet flexible
architecture to extract and fuse cross-modal features. This architecture can
tackle different numbers of CMR images and complex combinations of modalities,
with output branches targeting specific pathologies. To impose anatomical
knowledge on the segmentation results, we first propose a module to regularize
myocardium consistency and localize the pathologies, and then introduce an
inclusiveness loss to utilize relations between myocardial scars and edema. We
evaluated the proposed MyoPS-Net on two datasets, i.e., a private one
consisting of 50 paired multi-sequence CMR images and a public one from
MICCAI2020 MyoPS Challenge. Experimental results showed that MyoPS-Net could
achieve state-of-the-art performance in various scenarios. Note that in
practical clinics, the subjects may not have full sequences, such as missing
LGE CMR or mapping CMR scans. We therefore conducted extensive experiments to
investigate the performance of the proposed method in dealing with such complex
combinations of different CMR sequences. Results proved the superiority and
generalizability of MyoPS-Net, and more importantly, indicated a practical
clinical application.

a specific environment where the training samples and test samples obey the

formulates the PKG problem in multiple environments as a learning-based problem
by learning the knowledge such as data and models from known environments to
generate keys quickly and efficiently in multiple new environments.
Specifically, we propose deep transfer learning (DTL) and meta-learning-based

different training methods to pre-train the model in the known environments,
and then quickly adapt and deploy the model to new environments. Simulation
results show that compared with the methods without adaptation, the DTL and
meta-learning algorithms both can improve the performance of generated keys. In
addition, the complexity analysis shows that the meta-learning algorithm can
achieve better performance than the DTL algorithm with less time, lower CPU and

recommendation systems. It aims at selecting a small number of users such that
maximizing the influence spread across the online social network. Because of
its potential commercial and academic value, there are a lot of researchers
focusing on studying the IM problem from different perspectives. The main
challenge comes from the NP-hardness of the IM problem and \#P-hardness of
estimating the influence spread, thus traditional algorithms for overcoming
them can be categorized into two classes: heuristic algorithms and
approximation algorithms. However, there is no theoretical guarantee for
heuristic algorithms, and the theoretical design is close to the limit.
Therefore, it is almost impossible to further optimize and improve their
performance. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the
technology based on Machine Learning (ML) has achieved remarkable achievements
in many fields. In view of this, in recent years, a number of new methods have
emerged to solve combinatorial optimization problems by using ML-based

complex deep learning-based models to perform basecalling without considering

develop a comprehensive framework for creating deep learning-based basecallers
that provide high efficiency and performance. We introduce RUBICON, a framework
to develop hardware-optimized basecallers. RUBICON consists of two novel
machine-learning techniques that are specifically designed for basecalling.
First, we introduce the first quantization-aware basecalling neural

exploring and finding the best bit-width precision for each neural network
layer. Second, we develop SkipClip, the first technique to remove the skip
connections present in modern basecallers to greatly reduce resource and
storage requirements without any loss in basecalling accuracy. We demonstrate
the benefits of RUBICON by developing RUBICALL, the first hardware-optimized
basecaller that performs fast and accurate basecalling. Compared to the fastest
state-of-the-art basecaller, RUBICALL provides a 3.96x speedup with 2.97%

thermodynamic properties of the X-ray emitting plasma can be predicted in their
dependencies on the halo mass and redshift only. However, several departures
from this simple self-similar scenario have been observed. We show how our
semi-analytic model $i(cm)z$, which modifies the self-similar predictions
through two temperature-dependent quantities, the gas mass fraction $f_g=f_0
T^{f_1} E_z^{f_z}$ and the temperature variation $f_T=t_0 T^{t_1} E_z^{t_z}$,
can be calibrated to incorporate the mass and redshift dependencies. We used a
published set of 17 scaling relations to constrain the parameters of the model.
We were subsequently able to make predictions as to the slope of any observed
scaling relation within a few percent of the central value and about one
$\sigma$ of the nominal error. Contextually, the evolution of these scaling
laws was also determined, with predictions within $1.5 \sigma$ and within 10
percent of the observational constraints. Relying on this calibration, we have
also evaluated the consistency of the predictions on the radial profiles with
some observational datasets. For a sample of high-quality data (X-COP), we were
able to constrain a further parameter of the model, the hydrostatic bias $b$.
By calibrating the model, we have determined that (i) the slopes of the
temperature dependence are $f_1=0.403 (\pm0.009)$ and $t_1=0.144 (\pm0.017)$;
and that (ii) the dependence upon $E_z$ are constrained to be $f_z=-0.004 (\pm
0.023)$ and $t_z=0.349 (\pm 0.059)$. These values permit one to estimate
directly how the normalizations of a given quantity $Q_{\Delta}$ changes as a
function of the mass (or temperature) and redshift halo in the form $Q_{\Delta}
\sim M^{a_M} E_z^{a_z} \sim T^{a_T} E_z^{a_{Tz}}$, in very good agreement with

the transport scattering rate arising from the umklapp scattering between
electrons by the exchange of the spin excitations is derived and employed to
calculate the resistivity by making use of the Boltzmann equation. It is shown
that the resistivity is mainly dominated by the antinodal and nodal umklapp
scattering. In particular, a very low temperature $T_{\rm scale}$ scales with
$\Delta^{2}_{p}$, where $\Delta_{p}$ is the minimum umklapp vector at the
antinode. In the low temperature above $T_{\rm scale}$, the resistivity is
linear in temperature with the temperature linear coefficient that decreases
with the increase of doping, however, in the far lower temperature below
$T_{\rm scale}$, the resistivity is instead quadratic in temperature. The
theory also shows that the same spin excitation that acts like a bosonic glue
to hold the electron pairs together also mediates scattering of electrons in
the strange-metal phase responsible for the linear in temperature resistivity
in the low temperature.

the specific cases of selected radio arrays. We further aim to quantify the
influence of the quiet Sun on the Galactic Calibration. Methods. We look at
four different sky models that predict the full-sky Galactic emission in the

the reference maps on which they rely and use the output of the models to
determine their global level of agreement. Next, we take the sky exposures and

for each of them. Finally, we study the relative influence of the Sun in its
quiet state by projecting it onto the sky with brightness data from recent

power from the Galactic emission, which scales to approximately half of that
value as the uncertainty on the determination of the energy of cosmic
particles. When looking at the selected radio arrays, the uncertainty on the
predicted power varies between 10% and 19%. The influence of the quiet Sun

of integrals on a differential manifold. The Lagrangian, electromagnetic
current, and energy-momentum current must all be represented as twisted
4-forms, 3-forms, and vector-valued 3-forms, respectively. For an arbitrary
linear map on forms, we derive a commutative variation identity that allows
direct variation procedures without having to deal with the individual
components. One can deal with Maxwell-type Lagrangians in any dimension by
restricting the linear map to the generalized Hodge dual map (constitutive

commonly thought to be feasible only when trajectories are in certain patterns
ensuring observability. For this reason, to pursue observable patterns, it is
required either exciting the trajectory or searching key nodes in a long
interval, which is commonly highly nonlinear and may also lack resilience.
Therefore, such a positioning approach is still not widely accepted in
real-world applications. To address this issue, this work first investigates
the dissipative nature of flying robots considering aerial drag effects and
re-formulates the corresponding positioning problem, which guarantees
observability almost surely. On this basis, a dimension-reduced wriggling
estimator is proposed accordingly. This estimator slides the estimation horizon
in a stepping manner, and output matrices can be approximately evaluated based
on the historical estimation sequence. The computational complexity is then
further reduced via a dimension-reduction approach using polynomial fittings.
In this way, the states of robots can be estimated via linear programming in a
sufficiently long interval, and the degree of observability is thereby further
enhanced because an adequate redundancy of measurements is available for each
estimation. Subsequently, the estimator's convergence and numerical stability
are proven theoretically. Finally, both indoor and outdoor experiments verify
that the proposed estimator can achieve decimeter-level precision at hundreds
of hertz per second, and it is resilient to sensors' failures. Hopefully, this
study can provide a new practical approach for self-localization as well as

slightly the intensity of the OH stretch band in the liquid, and to reduce
small errors noted previously in the QCMD radial distribution functions. We
also modify the mass-scaling used in the adiabatic QCMD algorithm, which allows
the molecular dynamics timestep to be quadrupled, thus reducing the expense of

they work and for which applications they could be useful. There have been many
different proposals on how classical data can be encoded and what circuit
ans\""atze and measurement operators should be used to process the encoded data
and measure the output state of an ansatz. The choice of the aforementioned
operators plays a determinant role in the expressive power of the QML model. In
this work we investigate how certain changes in the circuit structure change
this expressivity. We introduce both numerical and analytical tools to explore
the effect that these operators have in the overall performance of the QML
model. These tools are based on previous work on the teacher-student scheme,
the partial Fourier series and the averaged operator size. We focus our
analysis on simple QML models with two and three qubits and observe that
increasing the number of parameterized and entangling gates leads to a more
expressive model for certain circuit structures. Also, on which qubit the
measurement is performed affects the type of functions that QML models could
learn. This work sketches the determinant role that the processing and
measurement operators have on the expressive power of simple quantum circuits.

vision-based applications to achieve high recognition accuracy. To reduce
inference delay and bandwidth cost for video analytics, the DNN models can be
deployed on the edge nodes, which are proximal to end users. However, the
processing capacity of an edge node is limited, potentially incurring
substantial delay if the inference requests on an edge node is overloaded.
While efforts have been made to enhance video analytics by optimizing the
configurations on a single edge node, we observe that multiple edge nodes can
work collaboratively by utilizing the idle resources on each other to improve
the overall processing capacity and resource utilization. To this end, we
propose a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based approach, named as
EdgeVision, for collaborative video analytics on distributed edges. The edge
nodes can jointly learn the optimal policies for video preprocessing, model
selection, and request dispatching by collaborating with each other to minimize
the overall cost. We design an actor-critic-based MARL algorithm with an
attention mechanism to learn the optimal policies. We build a multi-edge-node
testbed and conduct experiments with real-world datasets to evaluate the
performance of our method. The experimental results show our method can improve
the overall rewards by 33.6%-86.4% compared with the most competitive baseline

due to the development of hypersonic vehicles. However, which substance has the
highest melting point keeps a secret, since precise measurements in extreme
condition are overwhelmingly difficult. In the present work, an accurate deep
potential model of Hf-Ta-C-N system was firstly trained, and then applied to
search for the highest melting point material by using molecular dynamics
simulation and Bayesian global optimization. The predicted melting points agree
well with experiments, and confirm that the carbon site vacancy can enhance
melting points of rock-salt structure carbides. Solid solution with N is
verified as another new and more effective melting point enhancing approach for
HfC, while the conventional routing of solid solution with Ta (e.g. HfTa4C5) is
not suggested to result in a maximum melting point. The highest melting point
(~ 4236 K) is achieved with composition of HfC0.638N0.271, which is ~ 80 K
higher than the highest value in Hf-C binary system. The dominating mechanism
of N addition is believed to be the instable C-N and N-N bonds in liquid phase,
which reduces the liquid phase entropy and renders the liquid phase less
stable. The improved melting point and fewer gas generation during oxidation by
addition of N provides new routing to modify the thermal protection materials
for hypersonic vehicles.

The main technical challenge is the complexity and the nonlinearity of

no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent and every vertex in $V(\Gamma)\setminus C$
is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. Let $G$ be a finite group and $C$ a
subset of $G$. Then $C$ is said to be a perfect code of $G$ if there exists a
Cayley graph of $G$ admiting $C$ as a perfect code. It is proved that a
subgroup $H$ of $G$ is a perfect code of $G$ if and only if a Sylow
$2$-subgroup of $H$ is a perfect code of $G$. This result provides a way to
simplify the study of subgroup perfect codes of general groups to the study of
subgroup perfect codes of $2$-groups. As an application, a criterion for
determining subgroup perfect codes of projective special linear groups

the normal rhombohedral (R3c) phase, BFO in the composites is crystallized in
the triclinic phase (P1). Interestingly, the composites demonstrate a
significant enhancement in the magnetization, magnetoelectric coupling and show
higher resistivity than that of the regular BFO (R3c). As LNMO has its Curie
temperature at 280 K, the room temperature and above room temperature magnetic
contribution in the composites is expected to be from the triclinic BFO phase.
Experimentally observed enhancement in magnetization is validated using
classical Monte Carlo simulation and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The calculated band structures show a more delocalized band edge
in triclinic BFO which suggests the higher carrier effective mass i.e.,
enhanced resistivity in triclinic BFO as compared to the rhombohedral BFO.
Overall, this study reveals triclinic BFO as the promising room temperature
multiferroic phase which is helpful to optimize the multiferroicity of BFO and

Analyzing complaints ensures citizen feedback is taken into account during both

in improving performance of municipal corporations, while adding transparency
between citizens and the city officials. In the paper, constituency rankings
across the city infrastructure indicated a low importance towards greenery in
terms of Parks, where each constituency has less than 2% of their area as a
park. As populations in these areas are already high and increasing, this is
likely to worsen in the coming years. Comparing the results with complaints,
surprisingly the rankings of footpaths in constituencies were contrary to the
number of complaints in these constituencies, with high ranking constituencies
receiving the highest number of complaints, which would require further

isotropic scattering environment and neglecting the existence of channel
spatial correlation would possibly degrade the PKG performance. In this paper,
we establish a general spatially correlated channel model and propose a new
channel probing framework based on the transmit and the reflective beamforming.
We derive a closed-form key generation rate (KGR) expression and formulate an
optimization problem, which is solved by using the low-complexity Block
Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) with Mirror-Prox method. Simulation
results show that compared to the existing methods based on the i.i.d. fading

spacing between two neighboring RIS elements is a quarter of the wavelength.
Also, the KGR increases significantly with the number of RIS elements while

challenging problem, especially when the given data are corrupted by noise.
When the governing differential equation is a linear combination of various
differential terms, the identification problem can be formulated as solving a
linear system, with the feature matrix consisting of linear and nonlinear terms
multiplied by a coefficient vector. This product is equal to the time
derivative term, and thus generates dynamical behaviors. The goal is to
identify the correct terms that form the equation to capture the dynamics of
the given data. We propose a general and robust framework to recover
differential equations using a weak formulation, for both ordinary and partial
differential equations (ODEs and PDEs). The weak formulation facilitates an
efficient and robust way to handle noise. For a robust recovery against noise
and the choice of hyper-parameters, we introduce two new mechanisms, narrow-fit
and trimming, for the coefficient support and value recovery, respectively. For
each sparsity level, Subspace Pursuit is utilized to find an initial set of
support from the large dictionary. Then, we focus on highly dynamic regions
(rows of the feature matrix), and error normalize the feature matrix in the
narrow-fit step. The support is further updated via trimming of the terms that
contribute the least. Finally, the support set of features with the smallest
Cross-Validation error is chosen as the result. A comprehensive set of
numerical experiments are presented for both systems of ODEs and PDEs with
various noise levels. The proposed method gives a robust recovery of the
coefficients, and a significant denoising effect which can handle up to $100\%$
noise-to-signal ratio for some equations. We compare the proposed method with
several state-of-the-art algorithms for the recovery of differential equations.

study the realization of the dynamical singularity of the rate function for
finite-size systems under the twist boundary condition, which can be introduced
by applying a magnetic flux. By tuning the magnetic flux, we illustrate that
exact zeros of the Loschmidt echo can be always achieved when the postquench
parameter is across the underlying equilibrium phase transition point, and thus
the rate function of a finite-size system is divergent at a series of critical
times. We demonstrate our theoretical scheme by calculating the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Creutz model in detail and exhibit its
applicability to more general cases. Our result unveils that the emergence of
dynamical singularity in the rate function can be viewed as a signature for
detecting dynamical quantum phase transition in finite-size systems. We also
unveil that the critical times in our theoretical scheme are independent on the

manipulation detection has attracted considerable attention since the
increasing security risks posed by tampered images. To address these
challenges, a novel multi-scale multi-grained deep network (MSMG-Net) is
proposed to automatically identify manipulated regions. In our MSMG-Net, a
parallel multi-scale feature extraction structure is used to extract
multi-scale features. Then the multi-grained feature learning is utilized to
perceive object-level semantics relation of multi-scale features by introducing
the shunted self-attention. To fuse multi-scale multi-grained features, global
and local feature fusion block are designed for manipulated region segmentation
by a bottom-up approach and multi-level feature aggregation block is designed
for edge artifacts detection by a top-down approach. Thus, MSMG-Net can
effectively perceive the object-level semantics and encode the edge artifact.
Experimental results on five benchmark datasets justify the superior
performance of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art manipulation
detection and localization methods. Extensive ablation experiments and feature
visualization demonstrate the multi-scale multi-grained learning can present
effective visual representations of manipulated regions. In addition, MSMG-Net
shows better robustness when various post-processing methods further manipulate
images.

different application areas. However, machine learning algorithms do not
necessarily perform well on a new domain with a different distribution than its

approach of existing DA algorithms is to find domain invariant features whose
distributions in the source domain are the same as their distribution in the
target domain. In this paper, we propose to let the classifier that performs
the final classification task on the target domain learn implicitly the
invariant features to perform classification. It is achieved via feeding the
classifier during training generated fake samples that are similar to samples
from both the source and target domains. We call these generated samples
domain-agnostic samples. To accomplish this we propose a novel variation of
generative adversarial networks (GAN), called the MiddleGAN, that generates
fake samples that are similar to samples from both the source and target
domains, using two discriminators and one generator. We extend the theory of
GAN to show that there exist optimal solutions for the parameters of the two
discriminators and one generator in MiddleGAN, and empirically show that the
samples generated by the MiddleGAN are similar to both samples from the source
domain and samples from the target domain. We conducted extensive evaluations
using 24 benchmarks; on the 24 benchmarks, we compare MiddleGAN against various

subject to serial dilution, the inheritance of compositional information only
occurs when the time interval between dilutions is below a critical threshold
that depends on the efficiency of the catalytic reactions. Further, we show
that these thresholds provide rigorous bounds on the properties required for

Science to tackle urgent problems, such as climate changes, environmental
hazards, sustainable energy systems, pandemics, among others. In certain
domains like chemistry, scientific discovery carries the extra burden of
assessing risks of the proposed novel solutions before moving to the
experimental stage. Despite several recent advances in Machine Learning and AI
to address some of these challenges, there is still a gap in technologies to
support end-to-end discovery applications, integrating the myriad of available
technologies into a coherent, orchestrated, yet flexible discovery process.
Such applications need to handle complex knowledge management at scale,
enabling knowledge consumption and production in a timely and efficient way for
subject matter experts (SMEs). Furthermore, the discovery of novel functional
materials strongly relies on the development of exploration strategies in the
chemical space. For instance, generative models have gained attention within
the scientific community due to their ability to generate enormous volumes of
novel molecules across material domains. These models exhibit extreme
creativity that often translates in low viability of the generated candidates.
In this work, we propose a workbench framework that aims at enabling the
human-AI co-creation to reduce the time until the first discovery and the
opportunity costs involved. This framework relies on a knowledge base with
domain and process knowledge, and user-interaction components to acquire
knowledge and advise the SMEs. Currently,the framework supports four main
activities: generative modeling, dataset triage, molecule adjudication, and
risk assessment.

We conjecture that the general structure for multifold complexity should hold

from realistic and uncropped gallery images. One major challenge of person
search comes from the contradictory goals of the two sub-tasks, i.e., person
detection focuses on finding the commonness of all persons so as to distinguish
persons from the background, while person re-identification (re-ID) focuses on
the differences among different persons. In this paper, we propose a novel
Sequential Transformer (SeqTR) for end-to-end person search to deal with this
challenge. Our SeqTR contains a detection transformer and a novel re-ID
transformer that sequentially addresses detection and re-ID tasks. The re-ID
transformer comprises the self-attention layer that utilizes contextual
information and the cross-attention layer that learns local fine-grained
discriminative features of the human body. Moreover, the re-ID transformer is
shared and supervised by multi-scale features to improve the robustness of
learned person representations. Extensive experiments on two widely-used person
search benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, show that our proposed SeqTR not only
outperforms all existing person search methods with a 59.3% mAP on PRW but also
achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results with an mAP of
94.8% on CUHK-SYSU.

  Supervised by Dr. Alan Aspuru-Guzik. 40 Pages, 9 Figures, 1 Appendix",,,,"quant-ph cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the challenges currently facing the quantum computing community is the
design of quantum circuits which can efficiently run on near-term quantum
computers, known as the quantum compiling problem. Algorithms such as the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) have been shown to
generate or find optimal near-term quantum circuits. However, these methods are
computationally expensive and yield little insight into the circuit design
process. In this paper, we propose Quantum Deep Dreaming (QDD), an algorithm
that generates optimal quantum circuit architectures for specified objectives,
such as ground state preparation, while providing insight into the circuit
design process. In QDD, we first train a neural network to predict some
property of a quantum circuit (such as VQE energy). Then, we employ the Deep
Dreaming technique on the trained network to iteratively update an initial
circuit to achieve a target property value (such as ground state VQE energy).
Importantly, this iterative updating allows us to analyze the intermediate
circuits of the dreaming process and gain insights into the circuit features
that the network is modifying during dreaming. We demonstrate that QDD
successfully generates, or 'dreams', circuits of six qubits close to ground
state energy (Transverse Field Ising Model VQE energy) and that dreaming
analysis yields circuit design insights. QDD is designed to optimize circuits
with any target property and can be applied to circuit design problems both
within and outside of quantum chemistry. Hence, QDD lays the foundation for the
future discovery of optimized quantum circuits and for increased
interpretability of automated quantum algorithm design.

  36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Offline reinforcement-learning (RL) algorithms learn to make decisions using
a given, fixed training dataset without online data collection. This problem
setting is captivating because it holds the promise of utilizing previously
collected datasets without any costly or risky interaction with the
environment. However, this promise also bears the drawback of this setting as
the restricted dataset induces uncertainty because the agent can encounter
unfamiliar sequences of states and actions that the training data did not
cover. To mitigate the destructive uncertainty effects, we need to balance the
aspiration to take reward-maximizing actions with the incurred risk due to
incorrect ones. In financial economics, modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a
method that risk-averse investors can use to construct diversified portfolios
that maximize their returns without unacceptable levels of risk. We propose
integrating MPT into the agent's decision-making process, presenting a new
simple-yet-highly-effective risk-aware planning algorithm for offline RL. Our
algorithm allows us to systematically account for the \emph{estimated quality}
of specific actions and their \emph{estimated risk} due to the uncertainty. We
show that our approach can be coupled with the Transformer architecture to
yield a state-of-the-art planner, which maximizes the return for offline RL
tasks. Moreover, our algorithm reduces the variance of the results
significantly compared to conventional Transformer decoding, which results in a
much more stable algorithm -- a property that is essential for the offline RL
setting, where real-world exploration and failures can be costly or dangerous.

advertising has very recently replaced traditional advertising as the main
marketing force in the economy. In the past four years, a particularly
important development in the digital advertising industry is the shift from
second-price auctions to first-price auctions for online display ads. This
shift immediately motivated the intellectually challenging question of how to
bid in first-price auctions, because unlike in second-price auctions, bidding
one's private value truthfully is no longer optimal. Following a series of
recent works in this area, we consider a differentiated setup: we do not make
any assumption about other bidders' maximum bid (i.e. it can be adversarial
over time), and instead assume that we have access to a hint that serves as a
prediction of other bidders' maximum bid, where the prediction is learned
through some blackbox machine learning model. We consider two types of hints:
one where a single point-prediction is available, and the other where a hint
interval (representing a type of confidence region into which others' maximum
bid falls) is available. We establish minimax optimal regret bounds for both
cases and highlight the quantitatively different behavior between the two
settings. We also provide improved regret bounds when the others' maximum bid
exhibits the further structure of sparsity. Finally, we complement the
theoretical results with demonstrations using real bidding data.

topology-aware information aggregation is performed on EEG signals, and complex
relationships between channels are dynamically learned. Then, the
transferability of each channel is quantified based on the results of the
node-wise domain classifier, which is used as attention score. We recruited 10
subjects and collected their EEG signals in pleasure and rage state in
simulated driving conditions. We verify the effectiveness of our method on this
dataset and compare it with other methods. The results indicate that our method
is simple and efficient, with 85.63% accuracy in cross-subject experiments. It
can be used to identify road rage. Our data and code are available.
