non-Hermitian systems. Here, we report the experimental observation of NHSE.
Different from the previous non-reciprocal circuit implementation scheme using
logic components, we construct our one-dimensional (1D) circuits using linear
components only. Besides, we achieve the non-reciprocity by proportionally
varying the parameter value of the components. By measuring the voltage
response of each site, the information of eigenstates can be mapped out. The
results show that the voltage response is always larger on one end of the
circuit no matter on which end voltage driving is applied, indicating clearly
the presence of the NHSE. Furthermore, we also simulate the interplay of NHSE
and Anderson localization (AL) when additional disorder is introduced. Upon
increasing the disorder strength, we observe the transformation from the skin
effect phase to the localized phase. In the regime of skin effect phase, the
eigenstates are all localized at one edge while eigenstates are affected by the
voltage supply input in localized phase. Our findings unveil a possible new
route for simulation of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems.

spread among household communities with mitigation strategies such as
mask-wearing in place. In this work, we propose an epidemiological model that
explores the viral transmission over the multi-layer contact network composed
of the school layer and community layer with population heterogeneity on
mask-wearing behavior. We derive analytical expressions for three key
epidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic
threshold, and the expected epidemic size. In particular, we show how the
aforementioned quantities depend on the structure of the multi-layer contact
network, viral transmission dynamics, and the distribution of the different
types of masks within the population. Through extensive simulations, our
analytical results show near-perfect agreement with the simulation results with
a limited number of nodes. Utilizing the model, we study the impact of the
opening/closure of the school layer on the viral transmission dynamics with
various mask-wearing scenarios. Interestingly, we found that it's safe to open
the school layer with the proper proportion of good-quality masks in the
population. Moreover, we validate the theory of the trade-off between
source-control and self-protection over a single layer by Tian et al on our
multi-layer setting. We conclude that even on a multi-layer network, it's of
great significance to treat the spreading process as two distinct phases in
mind when considering mitigation strategies. Besides, we would like to remark
that our model of spreading process over multi-layer networks with population
heterogeneity can also be applied to various other domains, such as
misinformation control.

  Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Soft robotic actuators are safe and adaptable devices with inherent
compliance, which makes them attractive for manipulating delicate and complex
objects. Researchers have integrated stiff materials into soft actuators to
increase their force capacity and direct their deformation. However, these
embedded materials have largely been pre-prescribed and static, which
constrains the actuators to a predetermined range of motion. In this work,
electroadhesive (EA) clutches integrated on a single-chamber soft pneumatic
actuator (SPA) provide local programmable stiffness modulation to control the
actuator deformation. We show that activating different clutch patterns
inflates a silicone membrane into pyramidal, round, and plateau shapes.
Curvatures from these shapes are combined during actuation to apply forces on
both a 3.7 g and 820 g object along five different degrees of freedom (DoF).
The actuator workspace is up to 12 mm for light objects. Clutch deactivation,
which results in local elastomeric expansion, rapidly applies forces up to 3.2
N to an object resting on the surface and launches a 3.7 g object in controlled
directions. The actuator also rotates a heavier, 820 g, object by 5 degrees and
rapidly restores it to horizontal alignment after clutch deactivation. This
actuator is fully powered by a 5 V battery, AA battery, DC-DC transformer, and
4.5 V (63 g) DC air pump. These results demonstrate a first step towards
realizing a soft actuator with high DoF shape change that preserves the
inherent benefits of pneumatic actuation while gaining the electrical
controllability and strength of EA clutches. We envision such a system
supplying human contact forces in the form of a low-profile sit-to-stand
assistance device, bed-ridden patient manipulator, or other ergonomic
mechanism.

investigate the conformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the
presence of attractive crowders. We show that, for low crowded densities, the
polymer predominantly shows three phases as a function of both intra polymer
and polymer-crowder interactions: (1) weak intra polymer and weak
polymer-crowder attractive interactions induce extended or coil polymer
conformations (phase E) (2) strong intra polymer and relatively weak
polymer-crowder attractive interactions induce collapsed or globular
conformations (phase CI) and (3) strong polymer-crowder attractive
interactions, regardless of intra polymer interactions, induce a second
collapsed or globular conformation that encloses bridging crowders (phase CB).
The detailed phase diagram is obtained by determining the phase boundaries
delineating the different phases based on an analysis of the radius of gyration
as well as bridging crowders. The dependence of the phase diagram on strength
of crowder-crowder attractive interactions and crowder density is clarified. We
also show that when the crowder density is increased, a third collapsed phase
of the polymer emerges for weak intra polymer attractive interactions. This
crowder density induced compaction is shown to be enhanced by stronger
crowder-crowder attraction and is different from the depletion induced collapse
mechanism which is primarily driven by repulsive interactions. We also provide
a unified explanation of the observed reentrant swollen/extended conformations
of earlier simulations of weak and strongly self interacting polymers in terms
of crowder-crowder attractive interactions.

Saturn is used to explore seasonal and non-seasonal variability in thermal
emission over more than a Saturnian year (1984-2022). Thermal emission measured
by 3-m and 8-m-class observatories compares favourably with synthetic images
based on both Cassini-derived temperature records and the predictions of
radiative climate models. 8-m class facilities are capable of resolving thermal
contrasts on the scale of Saturn's belts, zones, polar hexagon, and polar
cyclones, superimposed onto large-scale seasonal asymmetries. Seasonal changes
in brightness temperatures of $\sim30$ K in the stratosphere and $\sim10$ K in
the upper troposphere are observed, as the northern and southern polar
stratospheric vortices (NPSV and SPSV) form in spring and dissipate in autumn.
The timings of the first appearance of the warm polar vortices is successfully
reproduced by radiative climate models, confirming them to be radiative
phenomena, albeit entrained within sharp boundaries influenced by dynamics.
Axisymmetric thermal bands (4-5 per hemisphere) display temperature gradients
that are strongly correlated with Saturn's zonal winds, indicating winds that
decay in strength with altitude, and implying meridional circulation cells
forming the system of cool zones and warm belts. Saturn's thermal structure is
largely repeatable from year to year (via comparison of infrared images in 1989
and 2018), with the exception of low-latitudes. Here we find evidence of
inter-annual variations because the equatorial banding at 7.9 $\mu$m is
inconsistent with a $\sim15$-year period for Saturn's equatorial stratospheric
oscillation, i.e., it is not strictly semi-annual. Finally, observations
between 2017-2022 extend the legacy of the Cassini mission, revealing the
continued warming of the NPSV during northern summer. [Abr.]

equivalence principle; the idea that equivalent mathematical structures satisfy
the same properties. Indeed, in Homotopy Type Theory, properties and structures
can be transported over type equivalences. However, we may wish to explain the
equivalence principle without relying on the univalence axiom. For example, all
type formers preserve equivalences in most type theories; thus it should be
possible to transport structures over type equivalences even in non-univalent
type theories.
  We define external univalence, a property of type theories (and more general
second-order generalized algebraic theories) that captures the preservation of
equivalences (or other homotopy relations). This property is defined
syntactically, as the existence of identity types on the (syntactically
defined) coclassifying (Sigma,Pi_rep)-CwF (also called generic model or walking
model) of the theory. Semantically, it corresponds to the existence of some
left semi-model structure on the category of models of the theory. We give
syntactic conditions that can be used to check that a theory satisfies external
univalence. We prove external univalence for some theories, such as the
first-order generalized algebraic theory of categories, and dependent type
theory with any standard choice of type formers and axioms, including identity
types, Sigma-types, Pi-types, universes \`a la Tarski, the univalence axiom,

robust model, we focus on developing algorithms for carrying out the robust
Bellman updates required to complete robust value iteration. We first formulate
the update as a linear program by discretising the ambiguity set. Since this
model scales poorly with problem size and requires large amounts of
pre-computation, we develop two additional algorithms for solving the robust
Bellman update. Firstly, we present a cutting surface algorithm for solving

galaxy merger identification using exclusively photometric information. Our
purpose is not only to test the method's efficiency, but also to understand
what merger properties the NN can learn and what their physical interpretation
is. Methods. We created a class-balanced training dataset of 5\,860 galaxies
split into mergers and non-mergers. The galaxy observations came from SDSS DR6
and were visually identified in Galaxy Zoo. The 2$\,$930 mergers were selected
from known SDSS mergers and the respective non-mergers were the closest match
in both redshift and $r$ magnitude. The NN architecture was built by testing a
different number of layers with different sizes and variations of the dropout
rate. We compared input spaces constructed using: the five SDSS filters: $u$,
$g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$; combinations of bands, colours, and their errors; six
magnitude types; and variations of input normalization. Results. We find that
the fibre magnitude errors contribute the most to the training accuracy.
Studying the parameters from which they are calculated, we show that the input
space built from the sky error background in the five SDSS bands alone leads to
92.64 $\pm$ 0.15 \% training accuracy. We also find that the input
normalization, that is to say, how the data are presented to the NN, has a
significant effect on the training performance. Conclusions. We conclude that,
from all the SDSS photometric information, the sky error background is the most
sensitive to merging processes. This finding is supported by an analysis of its
five-band feature space by means of data visualization. Moreover, studying the
plane of the $g$ and $r$ sky error bands shows that a decision boundary line is
enough to achieve an accuracy of 91.59\%.

keypoints, from a single 2D image.
  The shape and pose are learned directly from images collected by categories
and their partial 2D keypoint annotations.. In this work, we first propose an
end-to-end training framework for intermediate 2D keypoints extraction and
final 3D shape and pose estimation. The proposed framework is then trained
using only the weak supervision of the intermediate 2D keypoints. Additionally,
we devise a semi-supervised training framework that benefits from both labeled
and unlabeled data. To leverage the unlabeled data, we introduce and exploit
the \emph{piece-wise planar hull} prior of the canonical object shape. These
planar hulls are defined manually once per object category, with the help of
the keypoints. On the one hand, the proposed method learns to segment these
planar hulls from the labeled data. On the other hand, it simultaneously
enforces the consistency between predicted keypoints and the segmented hulls on
the unlabeled data. The enforced consistency allows us to efficiently use the
unlabeled data for the task at hand. The proposed method achieves comparable
results with fully supervised state-of-the-art methods by using only half of
the annotations. Our source code will be made publicly available.

this wave-powered mechanism of propulsion, we here demonstrate that chiral

Scaling laws and a simplified model of the wavefield reveal the underlying

the angular velocity across parameters. Leveraging the control over the chiral
object's direction of rotation, we then demonstrate that a floating body with
an asymmetric mass distribution and chirality can be remotely steered along
two-dimensional trajectories via modulation of the driving frequency alone.
This accessible and tunable macroscopic system serves as a potential platform
for future explorations of chiral active and driven matter, and demonstrates a
mechanism by which wave-mediated fluid forces can be manipulated for directed

novel gradient-free optimization-based formulation for the pre- and
post-buckling analyses of space truss structures. Space trusses are often
employed in structural engineering to build large steel constructions, such as
bridges and domes, whose structural response is characterized by large
displacements. Therefore, these structures are vulnerable to progressive
collapses due to local or global buckling effects, leading to sudden failures.
The method proposed in this paper allows the analysis of the load-equilibrium
path of truss structures to permanent and variable loading, including stable
and unstable equilibrium stages and explicitly considering geometric
nonlinearities. The goal of this work is to determine these equilibrium stages
via optimization of the Lagrangian kinematic parameters of the system,
determining the global equilibrium. However, this optimization problem is
non-trivial due to the undefined parameter domain and the sensitivity and
interaction among the Lagrangian parameters. Therefore, we propose formulating
this problem as a nonlinear, multimodal, unconstrained, continuous optimization
problem and develop a novel adaptive search space decomposition method, which
progressively and adaptively re-defines the search domain (hypersphere) to
evaluate the equilibrium of the system using a gradient-free optimization
algorithm. We tackle three benchmark problems and evaluate a medium-sized test
representing a real structural problem in this paper. The results are compared
to those available in the literature regarding displacement-load curves and
deformed configurations. The accuracy and robustness of the adopted methodology
show a high potential of gradient-free algorithms in analyzing space truss

component in seamless human-computer interaction. It has emerged as one of the
most convenient and natural methods to interact with the web and is especially
desirable in voice-controlled environments. Despite being one of the oldest
research areas, the current QA system faces the critical challenge of handling
multilingual queries. To build an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent that can
serve multilingual end users, a QA system is required to be language versatile
and tailored to suit the multilingual environment. Recent advances in QA models
have enabled surpassing human performance primarily due to the availability of
a sizable amount of high-quality datasets. However, the majority of such
annotated datasets are expensive to create and are only confined to the English
language, making it challenging to acknowledge progress in foreign languages.
Therefore, to measure a similar improvement in the multilingual QA system, it
is necessary to invest in high-quality multilingual evaluation benchmarks. In
this dissertation, we focus on advancing QA techniques for handling end-user
queries in multilingual environments. This dissertation consists of two parts.
In the first part, we explore multilingualism and a new dimension of
multilingualism referred to as code-mixing. Second, we propose a technique to
solve the task of multi-hop question generation by exploiting multiple
documents. Experiments show our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on
answer extraction, ranking, and generation tasks on multiple domains of MQA,
VQA, and language generation. The proposed techniques are generic and can be
widely used in various domains and languages to advance QA systems.

cumbersome. In this paper, we explore the abilities of a large language model
(Codex) to help with formalisation in the Lean theorem prover. We find that
with careful input-dependent prompt selection and postprocessing, Codex is able
to formalise short mathematical statements at undergrad level with nearly 75\%

infeasible and we undertake a detailed case study. We choose a diverse set of
$13$ theorems at undergrad level with proofs that fit in two-three paragraphs.
We show that with a new prompting strategy Codex can formalise these proofs in
natural language with at least one out of twelve Codex completion being easy to
repair into a complete proof. This is surprising as essentially no aligned data
exists for formalised mathematics, particularly for proofs. These results
suggest that large language models are a promising avenue towards fully or

be a noncollinear antiferromagnet where the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering
is concomitant with a transition to an insulating state. Here, we find that for
low electron doping, the magnetic order on the nickel site is preserved while
electronically a new metallic phase is induced. We show that this metallic
phase has a Fermi surface that is mostly gapped by an electronic reconstruction
driven by the bond disproportionation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability

field perturbations for correction during reconstruction. So far, these
reconstructions have used the conjugate gradient method with early stopping
used as implicit regularization. However, this approach is likely suboptimal
for low-SNR cases like diffusion or high-resolution MRI. Here, we investigate
the extent that l1-wavelet regularization, or equivalently compressed sensing
(CS), combined with expanded encoding improves trade-offs between spatial
resolution, readout time and SNR for single-shot spiral diffusion-weighted
imaging at 7T. The reconstructions were performed using our open-source
GPU-enabled reconstruction toolbox, MatMRI, that allows inclusion of the
different components of the expanded encoding model, with or without CS.
Methods: In vivo accelerated single-shot spirals were acquired with five
acceleration factors (2-6) and three in-plane spatial resolutions (1.5, 1.3,
and 1.1 mm). From the in vivo reconstructions, we estimated diffusion tensors
and computed fractional anisotropy maps. Then, simulations were used to
quantitatively investigate and validate the impact of CS-based regularization
on image quality when compared to a known ground truth. Results: In vivo
reconstructions revealed improved image quality with retainment of small
features when CS was used. Simulations showed that the joint use of the
expanded encoding model and CS improves accuracy of image reconstructions
(reduced mean-squared error) over the range of acceleration factors
investigated. Conclusion: The expanded encoding model and CS regularization are
complementary tools for single-shot spiral diffusion MRI, which enables both
higher spatial resolutions and higher acceleration factors.

weights were obtained through direct estimation of the density ratio between
the source and balanced distributions by optimizing the variational
representation of $f$-divergence. For this, we selected $\alpha$-divergence as
it presents efficient optimization because it has an estimator whose sample
complexity is independent of its ground truth value and unbiased mini-batch
gradients; moreover, it is advantageous for the vanishing-gradient problem. In
addition, we provide the following two methods for estimating the balancing
weights: improving the generalization performance of the balancing weights and
checking the balance of the distribution changed by the weights. Finally, we
discuss the sample size requirements for the weights as a general problem of a
curse of dimensionality when balancing multidimensional data. Our study
provides a basic approach for estimating the balancing weights of
multidimensional data using variational $f$-divergences.

channels have been proposed that lead to this passivity. To date, robust
passive galaxy candidates have been detected up to $z \leqslant 5$, but it is
still unknown if they exist at higher redshifts, what their relative abundances
are, and what causes them to stop forming stars. We present predictions from
the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a series of zoom
simulations of a range of overdensities using the EAGLE code. Passive galaxies
occur naturally in the EAGLE model at high redshift, and are in good agreement
with number density estimates from HST and early JWST results at $3 \leqslant z
\leqslant 5$. Due to the unique FLARES approach, we extend these predictions to
higher redshifts, finding passive galaxy populations up to $z \sim 8$. Feedback
from supermassive black holes is the main driver of passivity, leading to
reduced gas fractions and star forming gas reservoirs. We find that passive
galaxies at $z \geqslant 5$ are not identified in the typical UVJ selection
space due to their still relatively young stellar populations, and present new
rest--frame selection regions. We also present NIRCam and MIRI fluxes, and find
that significant numbers of passive galaxies at $z \geqslant 5$ should be
detectable in upcoming wide surveys with JWST. Finally, we present JWST colour
distributions, with new selection regions in the observer--frame for
identifying these early passive populations.

PIM operation with other PIM operations and other memory operations, i.e., a
consistency model that takes into account PIM operations is vital. To the best
of our knowledge, little attention to PIM operation consistency has been given
in existing works. In this paper, we focus on a specific PIM approach, named
bulk-bitwise PIM. In bulk-bitwise PIM, large bitwise operations are performed
directly and stored in the memory array. We show that previous solutions for
the related topic of maintaining coherency of bulk-bitwise PIM have broken the
host native consistency model and prevent any guaranteed correctness. As a
solution, we propose and evaluate four consistency models for bulk-bitwise PIM,
from strict to relaxed. Our designs also preserve coherency between PIM and the
host processor. Evaluating the proposed designs' performance with a gem5

that the run time overhead of guaranteeing correctness is at most $6\%$, and in
many cases the run time is even improved. The hardware overhead of our design

optimization problems and show how a diverse selection of problems within the
complexity class PLS can be cast within this model. This abstraction allows us
to identify key structural properties, and corresponding parameters, that
determine the smoothed running time of local search dynamics. We formalize this
via a black-box tool that provides concrete bounds on the expected maximum
number of steps needed until local search reaches an exact local optimum. This
bound is particularly strong, in the sense that it holds for any starting
feasible solution, any choice of pivoting rule, and does not rely on the choice
of specific noise distributions that are applied on the input, but it is
parameterized by just a global upper bound $\phi$ on the probability density.
  We then demonstrate the power of this tool by instantiating it for various
PLS-hard problems to derive efficient smoothed running times. This not only
unifies, and greatly simplifies, prior existing positive results, but also
allows us to extend or improve them. Notable problems on which we provide such
a contribution are Max-Cut, the Travelling Salesman problem, and Network
Coordination Games. Additionally, in this paper we propose novel smoothed
analysis formulations, and prove polynomial smoothed running times, for
important local optimization problems that have not been studied before from
this perspective. Importantly, we provide an extensive study of the problem of
finding pure Nash equilibria in general and Network Congestion Games under
various representation models, including explicit, step-function, and
polynomial latencies.
  We show that all the problems we study can be solved by their standard local
search algorithms in polynomial smoothed time on PLS-hard instances in which
these algorithms have exponential worst-case running time.

(a permutation of its vertices) excluding some patterns. Important such graph
classes are among others: proper interval graphs, interval graphs, chordal
graphs, permutation graphs, (co-)comparability graphs. For example, a graph
$G=(V,E)$ is a proper interval graph if and only if $G$ has a layout $L$ such
that for every triple of vertices such that $x\prec_L y\prec_L z$, if $xz\in
E$, then $xy\in E$ and $yz\in E$. Such a triple $x$, $y$, $z$ is called an
indifference triple and layouts excluding indifference triples are known as
indifference layouts.
  In this paper, we investigate the concept of tree-layouts. A tree-layout
$T_G=(T,r,\rho_G)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a tree $T$ rooted at some node $r$
and equipped with a one-to-one mapping $\rho_G$ between $V$ and the nodes of
$T$ such that for every edge $xy\in E$, either $x$ is an ancestor of $y$ or $y$
is an ancestor of $x$. Clearly, layouts are tree-layouts.
  Excluding a pattern in a tree-layout is defined similarly as excluding a
pattern in a layout, but now using the ancestor relation. Unexplored graph
classes can be defined by means of tree-layouts excluding some patterns. As a
proof of concept, we show that excluding non-indifference triples in
tree-layouts yields a natural notion of proper chordal graphs. We characterize
proper chordal graphs and position them in the hierarchy of known subclasses of
chordal graphs. We also provide a canonical representation of proper chordal
graphs that encodes all the indifference tree-layouts rooted at some vertex.
Based on this result, we first design a polynomial time recognition algorithm
for proper chordal graphs. We then show that the problem of testing isomorphism
between two proper chordal graphs is in P, whereas this problem is known to be
GI-complete on chordal graphs.

the RIS. However, for a given base station (BS) cell, there exist immanent
structural characteristics of the environment which can be leveraged to reduce
the necessary number of phase allocations. We verify this observation by a
study on discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based phase allocations where we
exhaustively search for the best combination of DFT columns. Since this
brute-force search is unaffordable in practice, we propose to learn a neural
network (NN) for joint phase optimization and channel estimation because of the
dependency of the optimal phase allocations on the channel estimator, and vice
versa. We verify the effectiveness of the approach by numerical simulations
where common choices for the phase allocations and the channel estimator are
outperformed. By an ablation study, the learned phase allocations are shown to
be beneficial in combination with a different state-of-the-art channel

approximately 0.58eV, 1.57eV, 1.12eV, 1.28eV, for ErVO3, HoVO3, YVO3, LuVO3,
respectively. The magnetic contribution of Ho, Er, and V atoms in HoVO3, and
ErVO3 compounds was disentangled using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD). The magnetic anisotropies of RVO3 with (R = Er, Ho, Y, Lu) are studied
and analyzed using spin orbit coupling. We noticed an easy axis of
magnetization along the c-direction with strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy
energies for the non-magnetic rare earth elements (R = Lu, Y)VO3. For the
magnetic rare earth elements, the easy and hard magnetization direction were
found to be along b-axis and c-axis, and a- axis and c-axis for HoVO3, and
ErVO3, respectively. This means that instead of the standard magnetization
demagnetization process, large thermal effects can be obtained by spinning
their single crystals in constant magnetic fields. The exchange coupling
between (Ho-V) is also found to be greater than the other exchange interactions
in HoVO3. Accordingly, a large conventional magnetocaloric effect could be
created in HoVO3, since the Ho Ising moments experience a metamagnetic
transition. However, the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is expected to be lower in
ErVO3 due to the weak (Er-V) exchange coupling.

the magnet's five degrees of freedom (5 DoF) in a single inference step without

recently due to novel applications in health, engineering, finance and the
social sciences. Three issues arise when analyzing VAR's: (a) The high
dimensional nature of the model in the presence of many time series that poses
challenges for consistent estimation of its parameters; (b) the presence of
temporal dependence introduces additional challenges for theoretical analysis
of various estimation procedures; (b) the presence of heavy tails in a number
of applications. Recent work, e.g. [Basu and Michailidis, 2015],[Kock and
Callot,2015], has addressed consistent estimation of sparse high dimensional,
stable Gaussian VAR models based on an $\ell_1$ LASSO procedure. Further, the
rates obtained are optimal, in the sense that they match those for iid data,
plus a multiplicative factor (which is the ""price"" paid) for temporal
dependence.
  However, the third issue remains unaddressed in extant literature. This paper
extends existing results in the following important direction: it considers
consistent estimation of the parameters of sparse high dimensional VAR models
driven by heavy tailed homoscedastic or heteroskedastic noise processes (that
do not possess all moments). A robust penalized approach (e.g., LASSO) is
adopted for which optimal consistency rates and corresponding finite sample
bounds for the underlying model parameters are obtain that match those for iid
data, albeit paying a price for temporal dependence. The theoretical results
are illustrated on VAR models and also on other popular time series models.
Notably, the key technical tool used, is a single concentration bound for heavy
tailed dependent processes.

simple tools to demonstrate how thermal gradients arise in systems with thin
conducting films on bulk substrates. The main results are that a thermal
gradient pointing perpendicular to the plane of a thin film supported on a
macroscopic substrate is very common, even while the largest temperature drop
in the system will exist across the bulk substrate itself. These results point
to the need to understand the range of thermoelectric and magnetothermoelectric

bispectrum is the main source of information for equilateral and orthogonal

labels to keep positive samples far away from negative ones. However, this type
of method normally ignores the crucial knowledge hidden in the data (e.g.,
intra-class information variation), which is harmful to the generalization of
the trained model. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose Online
Batch Diffusion-based Self-Distillation (OBD-SD) for DML. Specifically, we
first propose a simple but effective Progressive Self-Distillation (PSD), which
distills the knowledge progressively from the model itself during training. The
soft distance targets achieved by PSD can present richer relational information
among samples, which is beneficial for the diversity of embedding
representations. Then, we extend PSD with an Online Batch Diffusion Process
(OBDP), which is to capture the local geometric structure of manifolds in each
batch, so that it can reveal the intrinsic relationships among samples in the
batch and produce better soft distance targets. Note that our OBDP is able to
restore the insufficient manifold relationships obtained by the original PSD
and achieve significant performance improvement. Our OBD-SD is a flexible
framework that can be integrated into state-of-the-art (SOTA) DML methods.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, namely CUB200, CARS196, and
Stanford Online Products, demonstrate that our OBD-SD consistently improves the

$N=O\big(\operatorname{poly}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon},\log\big(\frac{1}{\delta}\big),M_n^{r+\alpha},\log(m)\big)\big)$
samples of an unknown $m$-mode state $\rho$ suffice to learn the expected value
of any $r$-local polynomial in the canonical observables of degree $\alpha$,
both with high probability $1-\delta$ and accuracy $\epsilon$, as long as the
state $\rho$ has moments of order $n>\alpha$ bounded by $M_n$. By
simultaneously truncating states and operators in energy and phase space, we
are able to overcome new mathematical challenges that arise due to the
infinite-dimensionality of CV systems. We also provide a scheme to learn
nonlinear functionals of the state, such as entropies over any small number of
modes, by leveraging recent energy-constrained entropic continuity bounds.
Finally, we provide numerical evidence of the efficiency of our protocols in
the case of CV states of relevance in quantum information theory, including
ground states of quadratic Hamiltonians of many-body systems and cat qubit
states. We expect our scheme to provide good recovery in learning relevant
states of 2D materials and photonic crystals.

recently introduced structured state space models (SSMs) as a particularly
promising approach due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in time
series. We demonstrate that this approach leads to significant improvements
over the current state-of-the-art for ECG classification, which we trace back
to individual pathologies. Furthermore, the model's ability to capture
long-term dependencies allows to shed light on long-standing questions in the
literature such as the optimal sampling rate or window size to train
classification models. Interestingly, we find no evidence for using data
sampled at 500Hz as opposed to 100Hz and no advantages from extending the
model's input size beyond 3s. Based on this very promising first assessment,
SSMs could develop into a new modeling paradigm for ECG analysis.

consuming. I propose AttenFace, a standalone system to analyze, track and grant
attendance in real time using face recognition. Using snapshots of class from
live camera feed, the system identifies students and marks them as present in a
class based on their presence in multiple snapshots taken throughout the class
duration. Face recognition for each class is performed independently and in
parallel, ensuring that the system scales with number of concurrent classes.
Further, the separation of the face recognition server from the back-end server
for attendance calculation allows the face recognition module to be integrated
with existing attendance tracking software like Moodle. The face recognition
algorithm runs at 10 minute intervals on classroom snapshots, significantly
reducing computation compared to direct processing of live camera feed. This
method also provides students the flexibility to leave class for a short
duration (such as for a phone call) without losing attendance for that class.
Attendance is granted to a student if he remains in class for a number of
snapshots above a certain threshold. The system is fully automatic and requires
no professor intervention or any form of manual attendance or even camera
set-up, since the back-end directly interfaces with in-class cameras. AttenFace
is a first-of-its-kind one-stop solution for face-recognition-enabled
attendance in educational institutions that prevents proxy, handling all
aspects from students checking attendance to professors deciding their own
attendance policy, to college administration enforcing default attendance
rules.

common security attack scenarios in mHealth context and engaged a total of 105
app users to monitor their actions and analyse their behavior. We analysed
users data with statistical analysis including reliability and correlations

indicate that whilst the minority of our participants perceived access
permissions positively, the majority had negative views by indicating that such
an app could violate or cost them to lose privacy. Users provide their consent,
granting permissions, without a careful review of privacy policies that leads
to undesired or malicious access to health critical data. The results also
indicated that 73.3% of our participants had denied at least one access

cosine similarity. The resulting bi-encoder models can guide transformers as a
response ranking model towards a goal in a zero-shot fashion by projecting the
goal utterance and the corresponding reply candidates into a latent space. Here
the cosine similarity indicates the distance/reachability of a candidate
utterance towards the corresponding goal which we define as curved space.
Furthermore, we explore how these forward-entailing language representations
can be utilized for assessing the likelihood of sequences by the entailment
strength i.e. through the cosine similarity of its individual members (encoded
separately) as an emergent property in the curved space. This allows us to
imagine the likelihood of future patterns in dialogues, specifically by
ordering/identifying future goal utterances that are multiple turns away, given
a dialogue context. As part of our analysis, we investigate characteristics
that make conversations (un)plannable and find strong evidence of planning
capability over multiple turns (in 61.56\% over 3 turns) in conversations from

in the solar atmosphere. They are also indicative of non-potential magnetic
fields and magnetic reconnection. Unfortunately, the direct measuring of
electric currents has traditionally been riddled with inaccuracies. We study
how accurately we can infer electric currents under different scenarios. We
carry out increasingly complex inversions of the radiative transfer equation
for polarized light applied to Stokes profiles synthesized from radiative
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The inversion yields
the magnetic field vector, ${\bf B}$, from which the electric current density,
${\bf j}$, is derived by applying Ampere's law. We find that the retrieval of
the electric current density is only slightly affected by photon noise or
spectral resolution. However, the retrieval steadily improves as the Stokes
inversion becomes increasingly elaborated. In the least complex case (a
Milne-Eddington-like inversion applied to a single spectral region), it is
possible to determine the individual components of the electric current density
($j_{\rm x}$, $j_{\rm y}$, $j_{\rm z}$) with an accuracy of $\sigma=0.90-1.00$
dex, whereas the modulus ($\|{\bf j}\|$) can only be determined with
$\sigma=0.75$ dex. In the most complicated case (with multiple spectral
regions, a large number of nodes, Tikhonov vertical regularization, and
magnetohydrostatic equilibrium), these numbers improve to $\sigma=0.70-0.75$
dex for the individual components and $\sigma=0.5$ dex for the modulus.
Moreover, in regions where the magnetic field is above 300 gauss, $\|{\bf j}\|$
can be inferred with an accuracy of $\sigma=0.3$ dex. In general, the $x$ and
$y$ components of the electric current density are retrieved slightly better

revealing the quantum nature of the inflationary mechanism being related to the
longstanding issue of the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary
fluctuations. Several works have investigated the effect of quantum decoherence
on the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations. In particular, it has
been shown that cosmic decoherence leads to corrections to the curvature power
spectrum predicted by standard slow-roll inflation. Equally interesting, a non
zero curvature trispectrum has been shown to be purely induced by cosmic
decoherence, but surprisingly, decoherence seems not to generate any
bispectrum. We further develop such an analysis by adopting a generalized form
of the pointer observable, showing that decoherence does induce a non vanishing
curvature bispectrum and providing a specific underlying concrete physical
process. Present constraints on primordial bispectra allow to put an upper
bound on the strength of the environment-system interaction. In full
generality, the decoherence-induced bispectrum can be scale dependent provided
one imposes the corresponding correction to the power spectrum to be scale
independent. Such scale dependence on the largest cosmological scales might
represent a distinctive imprint of the quantum decoherence process taking place
during inflation. We also provide a criterion that allows to understand when
cosmic decoherence induces scale independent corrections, independently of the
type of environment considered. As a final result, we study the effect of
cosmic decoherence on tensor perturbations and we derive the decoherence
corrected tensor-to-scalar perturbation ratio. In specific cases, decoherence
induces a blue tilted correction to the standard tensor power spectrum.

centralized view of individual objects from the Zwicky Transient Facility's

astronomical archives and data sources. Initially built to enable efficient
expert feedback in the context of adaptive machine learning applications, it
has evolved into a full-fledged community asset that centralizes public
information and provides a multi-dimensional view of ZTF sources. For users, we
provide detailed descriptions of the data sources and choices underlying the
information displayed in the portal. For developers, we describe our
architectural choices and their consequences such that our experience can help
others engaged in similar endeavors or in adapting our publicly released code
to their requirements. The infrastructure we describe here is scalable and
flexible and can be personalized and used by other surveys and for other
science goals. The Viewer has been instrumental in highlighting the crucial
roles domain experts retain in the era of big data in astronomy. Given the
arrival of the upcoming generation of large-scale surveys, we believe similar
systems will be paramount in enabling an optimal exploitation of the scientific
potential enclosed in current terabyte and future petabyte-scale data sets. The

$\Omega(\log_\Delta\log n)$ lower bound [Brandt et al., STOC '16].
  Our main technical contribution is a constant time reduction to a constant
number of $(\text{deg}+1)$-list coloring instances, for $\Delta = \omega(\log^4
n)$, resulting in a $\text{poly} \log\log n$-round CONGEST algorithm for such

providing a new proof of Brooks' theorem for high degree graphs, and leading to
a constant-round Congested Clique algorithm in such graphs.
  When $\Delta=\omega(\log^{21} n)$, our algorithm even runs in $O(\log^* n)$
rounds, showing that the base in the $\Omega(\log_\Delta\log n)$ lower bound is
unavoidable.
  Previously, the best LOCAL algorithm for all considered settings used a
logarithmic number of rounds. Our result is the first CONGEST algorithm for

of the matter field and of halo centres selected with both the Rockstar and

level of the mean relative pairwise velocity can be demonstrated over a range
of scales, evolving from a few times the grid spacing at early times to
slightly below this scale at late times. Down to scales of order the force
smoothing, convergence is obtained at $\sim5\%$ precision, and shows a
behaviour indicating asymptotic stable clustering. We also infer for LCDM
simulations conservative estimates on the evolution of the lower cut-off to
resolution (at $1\%$ and $5\%$ precision) as a function of redshift. For the
halos, we establish convergence, for both Rockstar and CompaSO, of mass
functions at the $1\%$ precision level and of the mean pair-wise velocities
(and also 2PCF) at the $2\%$ level. We find that of the two halo finders,
Rockstar exhibits greater self-similarity, specially on small scales and small
masses. We also give resolution limits expressed as a minimum particle number

the learned model to other domains. The domain-invariant knowledge is
transferred from the model trained on labeled source domain, e.g., video game,
to unlabeled target domains, e.g., real-world scenarios, saving annotation
expenses. Existing UDA methods for semantic segmentation usually focus on
minimizing the inter-domain discrepancy of various levels, e.g., pixels,
features, and predictions, for extracting domain-invariant knowledge. However,
the primary intra-domain knowledge, such as context correlation inside an
image, remains underexplored. In an attempt to fill this gap, we propose a
unified pixel- and patch-wise self-supervised learning framework, called PiPa,
for domain adaptive semantic segmentation that facilitates intra-image
pixel-wise correlations and patch-wise semantic consistency against different
contexts. The proposed framework exploits the inherent structures of
intra-domain images, which: (1) explicitly encourages learning the
discriminative pixel-wise features with intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, and (2) motivates the robust feature learning of the identical
patch against different contexts or fluctuations. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of the proposed method, which obtains competitive accuracy on
the two widely-used UDA benchmarks, i.e., 75.6 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes and
68.2 mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes. Moreover, our method is compatible with
other UDA approaches to further improve the performance without introducing

RowHammer vulnerability that plagues modern DRAM (Dynamic Random Memory Access)
chips, which are used in almost all computing systems as main memory.
  RowHammer is the phenomenon in which repeatedly accessing a row in a real
DRAM chip causes bitflips (i.e., data corruption) in physically nearby rows.
This phenomenon leads to a serious and widespread system security
vulnerability, as many works since the original RowHammer paper in 2014 have
shown. Recent analysis of the RowHammer phenomenon reveals that the problem is
getting much worse as DRAM technology scaling continues: newer DRAM chips are
fundamentally more vulnerable to RowHammer at the device and circuit levels.
Deeper analysis of RowHammer shows that there are many dimensions to the
problem as the vulnerability is sensitive to many variables, including
environmental conditions (temperature \& voltage), process variation, stored
data patterns, as well as memory access patterns and memory control policies.
As such, it has proven difficult to devise fully-secure and very efficient
(i.e., low-overhead in performance, energy, area) protection mechanisms against
RowHammer and attempts made by DRAM manufacturers have been shown to lack
security guarantees.
  After reviewing various recent developments in exploiting, understanding, and
mitigating RowHammer, we discuss future directions that we believe are critical
for solving the RowHammer problem. We argue for two major directions to amplify
research and development efforts in: 1) building a much deeper understanding of
the problem and its many dimensions, in both cutting-edge DRAM chips and
computing systems deployed in the field, and 2) the design and development of
extremely efficient and fully-secure solutions via system-memory cooperation.

we propose a semi-parametric approach that leverages recent advances in latent

work thus poses the question of how it represents both traditional
encyclopaedic knowledge and evolving important news stories. In other words,
how is information on and attention towards current events integrated into the
existing topical structures of Wikipedia? To address this we develop a temporal
community detection approach towards topic detection that takes into account
both short term dynamics of attention as well as long term article network
structures. We apply this method to a dataset of one year of current events on
Wikipedia to identify clusters distinct from those that would be found solely
from page view time series correlations or static network structure. We are
able to resolve the topics that more strongly reflect unfolding current events
vs more established knowledge by the relative importance of collective
attention dynamics vs link structures. We also offer important developments by
identifying and describing the emergent topics on Wikipedia. This work provides

surrounding the Cygnus X star-forming region, suggest the presence of a cosmic
ray accelerator reaching energies up to a few PeV. The very-high-energy (VHE;
0.1-100~TeV) $\gamma$-ray emission may be explained by the interaction of
cosmic-ray hadrons with matter inside the Cocoon, but an origin of inverse
Compton radiation by relativistic electrons cannot be ruled out. Inverse
Compton $\gamma$-rays at VHE are accompanied by synchrotron radiation peaked in
X-rays. Hence, X-ray observations may probe the electron population and
magnetic field of the source. We observed eleven fields in or near the Cygnus
Cocoon with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory's X-Ray Telescope (Swift-XRT)
totaling 110 ksec. We fit the fields to a Galactic and extra-galactic
background model and performed a log-likelihood ratio test for an additional
diffuse component. We found no significant additional emission and established
upper limits in each field. By assuming that the X-ray intensity traces the TeV
intensity and follows an $dN/dE\propto E^{-2.5}$ spectrum, we obtained a 90\%
upper limit of $F_X < 8.7\times 10^{-11}\rm~erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ or $<
5.2\times 10^{-11}\rm~erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ on the X-ray flux of the entire
Cygnus Cocoon between 2 and 10 keV depending on the choice of hydrogen column

quantification pipeline, dubbed ``MachineMem measurer'', to collect machine
memorability scores of images. Similar to humans, machines also tend to
memorize certain kinds of images, whereas the types of images that machines and
humans memorialize are different. Through in-depth analysis and comprehensive
visualizations, we gradually unveil that ""complex"" images are usually more
memorable to machines. We further conduct extensive experiments across 11
different machines (from linear classifiers to modern ViTs) and 9 pre-training
methods to analyze and understand machine memory. This work proposes the
concept of machine memorability and opens a new research direction at the
interface between machine memory and visual data.

sampling (e.g., $\epsilon$-greedy) for exploration, but this method fails on
hard exploration tasks like Montezuma's Revenge. To address the challenge of
exploration, prior works incentivize exploration by rewarding the agent when it
visits novel states. Such intrinsic rewards (also called exploration bonus or
curiosity) often lead to excellent performance on hard exploration tasks.
However, on easy exploration tasks, the agent gets distracted by intrinsic
rewards and performs unnecessary exploration even when sufficient task (also
called extrinsic) reward is available. Consequently, such an overly curious
agent performs worse than an agent trained with only task reward. Such
inconsistency in performance across tasks prevents the widespread use of
intrinsic rewards with RL algorithms. We propose a principled constrained
optimization procedure called Extrinsic-Intrinsic Policy Optimization (EIPO)
that automatically tunes the importance of the intrinsic reward: it suppresses
the intrinsic reward when exploration is unnecessary and increases it when
exploration is required. The results is superior exploration that does not
require manual tuning in balancing the intrinsic reward against the task
reward. Consistent performance gains across sixty-one ATARI games validate our
claim. The code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/eipo.

self-consistent method to provide accretion and stellar parameters using SED
modeling and veiling information from near-IR observations, when possible. We

of $t_{\rm Q}\sim 10^{5}-10^{7}\rm\,yr$. However, lifetimes as short as $t_{\rm
Q}\lesssim 10^{4}\rm\,yr$ appear to be required by the smallest Ly$\alpha$
near-zones. These short lifetimes present an apparent challenge for the growth
of $\sim 10^{9}\rm\,M_{\odot}$ black holes at $z\gtrsim 6$. Accretion over
longer timescales is only possible if black holes grow primarily in an obscured
phase, or if the quasars are variable on timescales comparable to the
equilibriation time for ionized hydrogen. Distinguishing between very young
quasars and older quasars that have experienced episodic accretion with
Ly$\alpha$ absorption alone is challenging, however. We therefore predict the
signature of proximate 21-cm absorption around $z\gtrsim 6$ radio-loud quasars.
For modest pre-heating of intergalactic hydrogen by the X-ray background, where
the spin temperature $T_{\rm S} \lesssim 10^{2}\rm\,K$ prior to any quasar
heating, we find proximate 21-cm absorption should be observable in the spectra
of radio-loud quasars. The extent of the proximate 21-cm absorption is
sensitive to the integrated lifetime of the quasar. Evidence for proximate
21-cm absorption from the diffuse intergalactic medium within $2-3\rm\,pMpc$ of
a (radio-loud) quasar would be consistent with a short quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm
Q}\lesssim 10^{5}\rm\,yr$, and would provide a complementary constraint on
models for high redshift black hole growth.

kinetic instabilities by inducing velocity spreads between relativistically
streaming plasma components. Such microturbulence is likely imprinted on the
breakout signals of radiation-mediated shocks. However, large-scale, transverse
magnetic fields in the deceleration region of the shock transition can suppress
the dominant kinetic instabilities by preventing the development of velocity
separations between electron-positron pairs and a heavy ion species. We use a
one-dimensional (1D) five-fluid radiative transfer code to generate
self-consistent profiles of the radiation drag force and plasma composition in
the deceleration region. For increasing magnetization, our models predict
rapidly growing pair multiplicities and a substantial radiative drag developing
self-similarly throughout the deceleration region. We extract the critical
magnetization parameter $\sigma_{c}$, determining the limiting magnetic field
strength at which a three-species plasma can develop kinetic instabilities
before reaching the isotropized downstream. For a relativistic, single ion
plasma drifting with $\gamma_{u} = 10$ in the upstream of a relativistic
radiation-mediated shock, we find the threshold $\sigma_{c}\approx 10^{-7}$ for
the onset of microturbulence. Suppression of plasma instabilities in the case
of multi-ion composition would likely require much higher values of
$\sigma_{c}$. Identifying high-energy signatures of microturbulence in
shock-breakout signals and combining them with the magnetization limits
provided in this work will allow a deeper understanding of the magnetic
environment of cosmic explosions like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and neutron

BayeSN. This method has a notable advantage of being able to continuously model
the optical and near-infrared (NIR) SN Ia light curves simultaneously. We use
two independent distance indicators, Cepheids or the tip of the red giant

not find significant shifts in the estimate of $H_0$. Simultaneous modelling of
the optical and NIR yields up to $\sim$15% reduction in $H_0$ uncertainty

other rungs of the distance ladder, leveraging joint optical-NIR SN Ia data can
be critical to reducing the $H_0$ error budget.

the (Renyi-2) mutual information between the two copies of the SYK model upon
projective measurement of a subset of fermions in one copy. We propose a dual
JT gravity model that can account for the change of entanglement due to
measurement, and observe an entanglement wedge phase transition in the von
Neumann entropy. The entanglement wedge for the unmeasured side changes from
the region outside the horizon to include the entire time reversal invariant
slice of the two-sided geometry as the number of measured Majorana fermions
increases. Therefore, after the transition, the bulk information stored in the
measured subsystem is not entirely lost upon projection in one copy of the SYK

IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA, to investigate the physical processes impacting
the distribution of baryons in and around haloes across an unprecedented mass
range of $10^8<M_{\rm 200c}/{\rm M_{\odot}}<10^{15}$, from the halo centre out
to scales as large as $30\,R_{\rm 200c}$. We demonstrate that baryonic feedback
mechanisms significantly redistribute gas, lowering the baryon fractions inside
haloes while simultaneously accumulating this material outside the virial
radius. To understand this large-scale baryonic redistribution and identify the
dominant physical processes responsible, we examine several variants of TNG
that selectively exclude stellar and AGN feedback, cooling, and radiation. We
find that heating from the UV background in low-mass haloes, stellar feedback
in intermediate-mass haloes, and AGN feedback in groups ($10^{12} \leq M_{\rm

the least influenced by these processes on large scales. We introduce a new
halo mass-dependent characteristic scale, the closure radius $R_{\rm c}$,
within which all baryons associated with haloes are found. For groups and
clusters, we introduce a universal relation between this scale and the halo
baryon fraction: $R_{\rm c}/R_{\rm 200c,500c}-1=\beta(z)(1-f_{\rm b}(<R_{\rm

used to constrain theoretical models, particularly the physics of supernova and

global $SO(N)$ symmetry, with large $N$, we can not only account for the
lightness of the new scalars, but we can reduce the axion relic abundance in a
technically natural way. This opens up the possibility of large PQ scales,
including approaching the GUT scale, and still naturally producing the correct
relic abundance of axions. Also, in these models the effective PQ scale is
relatively small in the very early universe, and so this can help towards
alleviating the isocurvature problem from inflation. Furthermore, instead of
possible over-closure from cosmic strings, the extended symmetry implies the
formation of non-topological textures which provide a relatively small

indicating we live in a world with some degree of fine-tuning, this scale is a

the dark matter mass and the reheat temperature. It is shown that the avoided

of galaxy formation and evolution but is as yet largely unknown. Once discs
settle and become self-gravitating enough, stellar bars are able to form;
therefore, determining the ages of bars can shed light on the epoch of disc
settling, and on the onset of secular evolution. Nevertheless, until now,
timing when the bar formed has proven challenging. In this work, we present a
new methodology for obtaining the bar age, using the star formation history of
nuclear discs. Nuclear discs are rotation-supported structures, built by gas
pushed to the centre via bar-induced torques, and their formation is thus
coincident with bar formation. In particular, we use integral field
spectroscopic (IFS) data from the TIMER survey to disentangle the star
formation history of the nuclear disc from that of the underlying main disc,
which enables us to more accurately determine when the nuclear disc forms. We
demonstrate the methodology on the galaxy NGC 1433 -- which we find to host an
old bar that is $8.0^{+1.6}_{-1.1}\rm{(sys)}^{+0.2}_{-0.5}\rm{(stat)}$ Gyr old
-- and describe a number of tests carried out on both the observational data

investigate Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback mechanism since their
formidable energy release causes powerful winds at all scales and thus the
maximum feedback is expected.
  We aim at deriving the mean Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of a sample of
85 WISE-SDSS Selected Hyper-luminous (WISSH) quasars. Since the SED provides a
direct way to investigate the AGN structure, our goal is to understand if
quasars at the bright end of the luminosity function have peculiar properties
compared to the bulk of the population. We built a mean intrinsic SED after
correcting for the dust extinction, absorption and emission lines and
intergalactic medium absorption. We also derived bolometric, IR band and
monochromatic luminosities together with bolometric corrections at lambda =
5100 A and 3 micron. We define a new relation for the 3 micron bolometric
correction. We find that the mean SED of hyper-luminous WISSH QSOs is different
from that of less luminous sources, i.e. a relatively lower X-ray emission and
a near and mid IR excess which can be explained assuming a larger dust
contribution. WISSH QSOs have stronger emission from both warm and very hot
dust, the latter being responsible for shifting the typical dip of the AGN SED
from 1.3 to 1.1 micron. We also derived the mean SEDs of two sub-samples
created according to the presence of Broad Absorption Lines and equivalent
width of CIV line. We confirm that BALs are X-ray weak and that they have a
reddened UV-optical continuum. We also find that BALs tend to have stronger
emission from the hot dust component. This analysis suggests that
hyper-luminous QSOs have a peculiar SED compared to less luminous objects. It
is therefore critical to use SED templates constructed exclusively from very
bright quasars samples when dealing with particularly luminous sources.

apparently lack optical emission lines (``optically dull AGNs''). Although 1/4
of spectra appear absorption-line dominated in visual assessment, line
extraction with robust continuum subtraction from the MPA/JHU catalog reveals
usable [OIII] measurements in 98% of the sample, allowing us to study
[OIII]-underluminous AGNs together with more typical AGNs in the context of the
L$_{\mathrm{[OIII]}}$--L$_{X}$ relation. We find that ``optically dull AGNs''
do not constitute a distinct population of AGNs. Instead, they are the
[OIII]-underluminous tail of a single, unimodal L$_{\mathrm{[OIII]}}$--L$_{X}$
relation that has substantial scatter (0.6 dex). We find the degree to which an
AGN is underluminous in [OIII] correlates with the specific SFR or D$_{4000}$
index of the host, which are both linked to the molecular gas fraction. Thus
the emerging physical picture for the large scatter seems to involve the gas
content of the narrow-line region. We find no significant role for previously
proposed scenarios for the presence of optically dull AGNs, such as host
dilution or dust obscuration. Despite occasionally weak lines in SDSS spectra,
>80% of X-ray AGNs are identified as such with the BPT diagram. >90% are
classified as AGNs based only on [NII]/H$\alpha$, providing more complete AGN
samples when [OIII] or H$\beta$ are weak. X-ray AGNs with LINER spectra obey
essentially the same \lxo\ relation as Seyfert 2s, suggesting their line
emission is produced by AGN activity.

interplay between convection and pulsations. We treat 3D dynamical models of
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants similar to

and the properties of the self-excited pulsations. Output from global
'star-in-a-box' models computed with the CO5BOLD radiation-hydrodynamics code
were analysed, particularly in regards to the pulsation properties, to find
possible correlations with input and emergent stellar parameters. The fast
Fourier transform was applied to spherically averaged mass flows to identify
possible radial pulsation periods beneath the photosphere of the modelled
stars. Stellar parameters were investigated for correlations with the extracted
pulsation periods. We find that the pulsation periods varied with the stellar
parameters in good agreement with the current expectations. The pulsation
periods follow Ritter's period-mean density relation well and our AGB models
agree with period-luminosity relations derived from observations. A mass
estimate formula was derived from the 3D models, relating the stellar mass to
the fundamental mode pulsation period and the stellar radius. While the
non-linearity of the interplay between the self-excited pulsations and the

real-time thermal correlators, which we compute using the gravitational
Schwinger-Keldysh (grSK) geometry. We describe the structure of arbitrary

particular, we argue, that all such diagrams reduce to integrals supported on a
single copy of the exterior of the black hole. The integrand is obtained as a
multiple discontinuity of a function comprising ingoing boundary-bulk
propagators, monodromy functions which appear as radial Boltzmann weights, and
vertex factors. These results allow us to deduce the analytic structure of

device-specific features solely from raw RF signals to identify, classify and
authenticate wireless devices. One widely known issue lies in the inability of
these approaches to maintain good performances when the training data and
testing data are collected under varying deployment domains. For example, when
the learning model is trained on data collected from one receiver but tested on
data collected from a different receiver, the performance degrades
substantially compared to when both training and testing data are collected
using the same receiver. The same also happens when considering other varying
domains, like channel condition and protocol configuration. In this paper, we
begin by explaining, through testbed experiments, the challenges these
fingerprinting techniques face when it comes to domain portability. We will
then present some ideas on how to go about addressing these challenges so as to
make deep learning-based device fingerprinting more resilient to domain
variability.

topological data analysis to train machine learning models. While this field,
sometimes known as topological machine learning (TML), has seen some notable
successes, an understanding of how the process of learning from topological
features differs from the process of learning from raw data is still limited.
In this work, we begin to address one component of this larger issue by asking
whether a model trained with topological features learns internal
representations of data that are fundamentally different than those learned by
a model trained with the original raw data. To quantify ``different'', we
exploit two popular metrics that can be used to measure the similarity of the
hidden representations of data within neural networks, neural stitching and
centered kernel alignment. From these we draw a range of conclusions about how
training with topological features does and does not change the representations
that a model learns. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that structurally, the
hidden representations of models trained and evaluated on topological features
differ substantially compared to those trained and evaluated on the
corresponding raw data. On the other hand, our experiments show that in some
cases, these representations can be reconciled (at least to the degree required
to solve the corresponding task) using a simple affine transformation. We
conjecture that this means that neural networks trained on raw data may extract
some limited topological features in the process of making predictions.

for posterior inference that projects an input set of high-dimensional data to
a lower-dimensional, latent space. The latent space learned with a VAE offers
exciting opportunities to develop new data-driven design processes in creative
disciplines, in particular, to automate the generation of multiple novel
designs that are aesthetically reminiscent of the input data but that were
unseen during training. However, the learned latent space is typically
disorganized and entangled: traversing the latent space along a single
dimension does not result in changes to single visual attributes of the data.
The lack of latent structure impedes designers from deliberately controlling
the visual attributes of new designs generated from the latent space. This
paper presents an experimental study that investigates latent space
disentanglement. We implement three different VAE models from the literature
and train them on a publicly available dataset of 60,000 images of hand-written
digits. We perform a sensitivity analysis to find a small number of latent
dimensions necessary to maximize a lower bound to the log marginal likelihood
of the data. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-offs between the quality of
the reconstruction of the decoded images and the level of disentanglement of
the latent space. We are able to automatically align three latent dimensions
with three interpretable visual properties of the digits: line weight, tilt and
width. Our experiments suggest that i) increasing the contribution of the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prior over the latents and the
variational distribution to the evidence lower bound, and ii) conditioning
input image class enhances the learning of a disentangled latent space with a
VAE.

that the planet's transit depth drastically decreases from the optical to
near-infrared wavelengths. Thao et al. (2022) suggested that a thick planetary
haze and/or stellar spots may be the cause; however, even the best-fit model
only barely explains the data. Here, we propose that the peculiar transmission
spectrum may indicate that K2-33b possess a circumplanetary dust ring, an
analog of Jupiter's dust ring. We demonstrate that the ring could produce a
steep slope in the transmission spectrum even if its optical depth is as low as
$\sim {10}^{-2}$. We then apply a novel joint atmosphere-ring retrieval to
K2-33b and find that the ring scenario could well explain the observed spectrum
for various possible ring compositions. Importantly, the dust ring also
exhibits prominent absorption features of ring particles around $\sim$10
$\rm{\mu}m$, whose shape and strength depend on the composition of the ring.
Thus, future observations by JWST-MIRI would be able to test not only the ring
hypothesis but also, if it indeed exists, to constrain the composition of the
ring -- providing a unique opportunity to explore the origins of the dust ring
around its parent planet, soon after the planetary system's formation.

can be reconstructed from continuous weak measurements concurrent with coherent
time evolution in a system of two superconducting transmons coupled by a
flux-tunable coupler. In contrast to previous work, our technique does not
require interruptions, which would distort the recovered Hamiltonian. We
introduce an algorithm which recovers the Hamiltonian and density matrix from
an incomplete set of continuous measurements and demonstrate that it reliably
extracts amplitudes of a variety of single qubit and entangling two qubit
Hamiltonians. We further demonstrate how this technique reveals deviations from
a theoretical control Hamiltonian which would otherwise be missed by
conventional techniques. Our work opens up novel applications for continuous
weak measurements, such as studying non-idealities in gates, certifying analog
quantum simulators, and performing quantum metrology.

behavior can make it safer to deploy. However, such explanations are often
difficult to understand because of the complicated nature of many RL policies.
Effective human explanations are often contrastive, referencing a known
contrast (policy) to reduce redundancy. At the same time, these explanations
also require the additional effort of referencing that contrast when evaluating
an explanation. We conduct a user study to understand whether and when
contrastive explanations might be preferable to complete explanations that do
not require referencing a contrast. We find that complete explanations are
generally more effective when they are the same size or smaller than a
contrastive explanation of the same policy, and no worse when they are larger.
This suggests that contrastive explanations are not sufficient to solve the
problem of effectively explaining reinforcement learning policies, and require
additional careful study for use in this context.

these two modulation schemes, the spectral efficiency increases considerably

substantially increased. The optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector and the
enhanced low-complexity (ELC) detector for the RIS-SMBM system are proposed.
The ELC detector achieves near ML performance while reducing the complexity of
the optimal ML detector for the proposed RIS-SMBM system. We analyze the

ability of models to solve new problems without forgetting previously acquired

view of continual learning and develop a hierarchical information-theoretic
optimality principle that facilitates a trade-off between learning and
forgetting. We derive this principle from a Bayesian perspective and show its
connections to previous approaches to continual learning. Based on this
principle, we propose a neural network layer, called the
Mixture-of-Variational-Experts layer, that alleviates forgetting by creating a
set of information processing paths through the network which is governed by a
gating policy. Equipped with a diverse and specialized set of parameters, each
path can be regarded as a distinct sub-network that learns to solve tasks. To
improve expert allocation, we introduce diversity objectives, which we evaluate
in additional ablation studies. Importantly, our approach can operate in a
task-agnostic way, i.e., it does not require task-specific knowledge, as is the
case with many existing continual learning algorithms. Due to the general
formulation based on generic utility functions, we can apply this optimality

Furthermore, LA opens the door to opportunities for self-regulated learning in
higher education, a circular process in which learners activate and sustain
behaviours that are oriented toward their personal learning goals. The
potentials of LA and self-regulated learning are huge; however, they are not
yet widely applied in higher education institutions. Slovenian higher education
institutions have lagged behind other European countries in LA adoption. Our
research aims to fill this gap by using a qualitatively and quantitatively led
workflow for building a requirement-oriented LA solution, consisting of
empirically gathering the students' expectations of LA and presenting a
dashboard solution. Translated Student Expectations of Learning Analytics
Questionnaire and focus groups were used to gather expectations from learners.
Based on them, a user interface utilizing LA and grade prediction with an AI
model was implemented for a selected course. The interface includes early grade
prediction, peer comparison, and historical data overview. Grade prediction is
based on a machine learning model built on users' interaction in the virtual
learning environment, demographic data and lab grades. First, classification is
used to determine students at risk of failing - its precision reaches 98% after
the first month of the course. Second, the exact grade is predicted with the
Decision Tree Regressor, reaching a mean absolute error of 11.2grade points (on
a 100 points scale) after the first month. The proposed system's main benefit
is the support for self-regulation of the learning process during the semester,

EOSC-SYNERGY, a collaborative project involving more than 20 institutions from
eight European countries pooling their knowledge and experience to enhance
EOSC's capabilities and capacities, aims to bring EOSC closer to the scientific
communities. This article provides a summary analysis of the adaptations made
in the ten thematic services of EOSC-SYNERGY to embrace this paradigm. These
services are grouped into four categories: Earth Observation, Environment,
Biomedicine, and Astrophysics. The analysis will lead to the identification of
commonalities, best practices and common requirements, regardless of the
thematic area of the service. Experience gained from the thematic services
could be transferred to new services for the adoption of the EOSC ecosystem
framework.

learning systems. Currently, unsupervised out-of-distribution detection is
dominated by generative-based approaches that make use of estimates of the
likelihood or other measurements from a generative model. Reconstruction-based
methods offer an alternative approach, in which a measure of reconstruction
error is used to determine if a sample is out-of-distribution. However,
reconstruction-based approaches are less favoured, as they require careful
tuning of the model's information bottleneck - such as the size of the latent
dimension - to produce good results. In this work, we exploit the view of
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) as denoising autoencoders where
the bottleneck is controlled externally, by means of the amount of noise
applied. We propose to use DDPMs to reconstruct an input that has been noised
to a range of noise levels, and use the resulting multi-dimensional
reconstruction error to classify out-of-distribution inputs. We validate our
approach both on standard computer-vision datasets and on higher dimension
medical datasets. Our approach outperforms not only reconstruction-based
methods, but also state-of-the-art generative-based approaches. Code is

unclear. Here we assign well-calibrated uncertainties for two representative

these OMPs against the experimental data originally used to constrain them, we
show how a lack of outlier rejection and a systematic underestimation of

improved performance both against the original training corpora of experimental

we apply our uncertainty-quantified OMPs to two case studies of

fermion is its anapole moment. Though they cannot couple to single real
photons, these particles can interact with electric currents through virtual
photons. If a Majorana fermion is immersed in a background current, there is an
energy difference between the spin states of the fermion; the higher energy
state has its anapole moment antialigned with the current. In this paper, we
address the ability of a system of initially unpolarized Majorana fermions to
achieve some degree of polarization relative to a static background current. In
considering processes that allow the Majorana fermion's spin to flip to the
lower-energy state, we focus upon two irreversible processes: the spontaneous
emission of two real photons and the emission of a single real photon emitted
in virtual Compton scattering. Both of these processes involve coupling to
photons via the fermion's polarizaibilities. We compute the spin-flip
transition rates for these processes using a low-energy expansion of the
Hamiltonian and construct a toy model to showcase how these rates depend upon
the underlying parameters within a model. Applying these ideas to a thermal
dark matter (DM) model, we find that when the DM thermally decouples from the
Standard Model plasma in the early universe, two-photon emission is negligible
but partial polarization for the DM medium can proceed via virtual Compton
scattering if sufficient currents exist.

separate style transfer model to generate desired styles while maintaining
image quality in generated content as controlled by the text input.
Additionally, the guidance method can be applied without a style reference,
denoted as self style guidance, to generate images of more diverse styles.
Comprehensive experiments prove that the proposed method remains robust and

employing the Kernel Principal Component Analysis method. The novelty of this
map lies in the fact that it distributes the galaxies under study on the
surface of a well-defined ellipsoid, which, in turn, links basic concepts from
geometry to physical properties of the galaxies. Particularly, we have found
that the equatorial direction of the ellipsoid corresponds to the evolution of
the power source of ULIRGs, starting from the pre-merger phase, moving through
the starburst-dominated coalescing stage towards the active galactic nucleus
(AGN)-dominated phase, and finally terminating with the post-merger quasar
phase. On the other hand, the meridian directions distinguish deeply obscured
power sources of the galaxies from unobscured ones. These observations have
also been verified by comparison with simulated ULIRGs and quasars using
radiative transfer models. The diagram correctly identifies unique galaxies
with extreme features that lie distinctly away from the main distribution of
the galaxies. Furthermore, special two-dimensional projections of the ellipsoid
recover almost monotonic variations of the two main physical properties of the

naturally extends the well-known Spoon diagram and it can serve as a diagnostic
tool for existing and future infrared spectroscopic data, such as those

rates of close-in super-Earths decrease. This is in contradiction to the
expectation that the total mass of the planets in a system scale with the
protoplanetary disc mass and hence the stellar mass. Since the snow line plays
an important role in the planet formation process we examine differences in the
temperature structure of protoplanetary gas discs around stars of different
mass. Protoplanetary discs likely contain a dead zone at the midplane that is
sufficiently cold and dense for the magneto-rotational instability to be
suppressed. As material builds up, the outer parts of the dead zone may be
heated by self-gravity. The temperature in the disc can be below the snow line
temperature far from the star and in the inner parts of a dead zone. The inner
icy region has a larger radial extent around smaller mass stars. The increased
mass of solid icy material may allow for the in situ formation of larger and
more numerous planets close to a low-mass star. Super-Earths that form in the
inner icy region may have a composition that includes a significant fraction of
volatiles.

sensors are getting increased interest for low-latency and low-power inference
at the edge. However, multiple spiking neuron models have been proposed in the
literature with different levels of biological plausibility and different
computational features and complexities. Consequently, there is a need to
define the right level of abstraction from biology in order to get the best
performance in accurate, efficient and fast inference in neuromorphic hardware.
In this context, we explore the impact of synaptic and membrane leakages in
spiking neurons. We confront three neural models with different computational
complexities using feedforward and recurrent topologies for event-based visual
and auditory pattern recognition. Our results show that, in terms of accuracy,
leakages are important when there are both temporal information in the data and
explicit recurrence in the network. In addition, leakages do not necessarily
increase the sparsity of spikes flowing in the network. We also investigate the
impact of heterogeneity in the time constant of leakages, and the results show
a slight improvement in accuracy when using data with a rich temporal
structure. These results advance our understanding of the computational role of
the neural leakages and network recurrences, and provide valuable insights for
the design of compact and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware for embedded
systems.

but where the discreteness of the carriers of plastic deformation plays a
significant role. The formulations are restricted to small deformation
kinematics and the defects considered, dislocations and discrete shear
transformation zones (STZs), are described by their linear elastic fields. In
discrete defect plasticity both the stress-strain response and the partitioning
between defect energy storage and defect dissipation are outcomes of an
initial/boundary value problem solution. Discrete dislocation plasticity
modeling results are reviewed that illustrate the implications of defect
dissipation evolution for friction, fatigue crack growth and thermal softening.
Examples are also given of consequences of three modes of the evolution of
discrete defects for size dependence and dissipation in constrained shear. The
requirement that the dissipation rate is non-negative, which is a
specialization of the Clausius-Duhem inequality for a purely mechanical
formulation, imposes restrictions on kinetic relations for the evolution of
discrete defects. Explicit kinetic relations for discrete dislocation
plasticity dissipation and for discrete STZ plasticity dissipation identify
conditions that can lead to a negative dissipation rate. The statistical
mechanics form of the second law allows the Clausius-Duhem inequality to be
violated for a sufficiently small number of discrete events for a short time
period. In continuum mechanics, at least in some circumstances, satisfaction of
the Clausius-Duhem inequality can be regarded as a requirement for stability.
One dimensional continuum calculations illustrate that there can be a negative
dissipation rate over a short distance and for a short time period with overall
stability maintained. Implications for discrete defect plasticity modeling are
briefly discussed.

(TCP). We show that TCP offers better properties for failure prediction than
current uncertainty measures. Since the true class is by essence unknown at
test time, we propose to learn TCP criterion from data with an auxiliary model,
introducing a specific learning scheme adapted to this context. The relevance
of the proposed approach is validated on image classification and semantic

task of domain adaptation where it improves the selection of pseudo-labels in

conductivity (ANC) in most known materials is too small to be of practical use,
and there exist few guiding principles for finding materials with optimal
thermoelectric properties. This work shows that the ANC is maximal when there
is a ``coactive-staggered"" feature in the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). It
is shown that a minimal arrangement of two Weyl pairs leads to such a feature,
and tuning the separations between the pairs controls the temperature at which
the ANC is maximal. Several methods are proposed for creating such arrangements
of Weyl points starting from Dirac semimetal materials. It is also demonstrated
how an existing coactive-staggered AHC in a Heusler material can be exploited,
by collectively tuning the positions of the Weyl points through strain to
further enhance the ANC. A modest 20% amplification of the ANC is achieved,
even with relatively minor changes in Weyl point positions.

We identify 177 molecular clouds within the SMC by using CPROPS, of which 124
clouds are fully resolved with signal-to-noise ratio $>$ 5. The scaling
relationships show that the SMC clouds are (on average) less turbulent and less
luminous than their inner Milky Way counterparts of similar size by a factor of

an important but very challenging task. Compressing images using extremely low

of heavy artifacts due to the strong constraint in the number of bits available
for the compressed data. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand
words but on the other hand, language is very powerful in capturing the essence
of an image using short descriptions. With the recent success of diffusion
models for text-to-image generation, we propose a generative image compression
method that demonstrates the potential of saving an image as a short text
embedding which in turn can be used to generate high-fidelity images which is
equivalent to the original one perceptually. For a given image, its
corresponding text embedding is learned using the same optimization process as
the text-to-image diffusion model itself, using a learnable text embedding as

methods for unsupervised domain adaptation. Dropout-based Uncertainty-driven
Self-Training (DUST) proceeds by first training a teacher model on source
domain labeled data. Then, the teacher model is used to provide PLs for the
unlabeled target domain data. Finally, we train a student on augmented labeled
and pseudo-labeled data. The process is iterative, where the student becomes
the teacher for the next DUST iteration. A crucial step that precedes the
student model training in each DUST iteration is filtering out noisy PLs that
could lead the student model astray. In DUST, we proposed a simple, effective,
and theoretically sound PL filtering strategy based on the teacher model's
uncertainty about its predictions on unlabeled speech utterances. We estimate
the model's uncertainty by computing disagreement amongst multiple samples
drawn from the teacher model during inference by injecting noise via dropout.
In this work, we show that DUST's PL filtering, as initially used, may fail
under severe source and target domain mismatch. We suggest several approaches
to eliminate or alleviate this issue. Further, we bring insights from the
research in neural network model calibration to DUST and show that a
well-calibrated model correlates strongly with a positive outcome of the DUST
PL filtering step.

immense interest lately in various deep-learning problems. A diffusion
probabilistic model defines a forward diffusion stage where the input data is
gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise and then learns
to reverse the diffusion process to retrieve the desired noise-free data from
noisy data samples. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for their strong
mode coverage and quality of the generated samples despite their known
computational burdens. Capitalizing on the advances in computer vision, the
field of medical imaging has also observed a growing interest in diffusion
models. To help the researcher navigate this profusion, this survey intends to
provide a comprehensive overview of diffusion models in the discipline of
medical image analysis. Specifically, we introduce the solid theoretical
foundation and fundamental concepts behind diffusion models and the three
generic diffusion modelling frameworks: diffusion probabilistic models,
noise-conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. Then,
we provide a systematic taxonomy of diffusion models in the medical domain and
propose a multi-perspective categorization based on their application, imaging
modality, organ of interest, and algorithms. To this end, we cover extensive
applications of diffusion models in the medical domain. Furthermore, we
emphasize the practical use case of some selected approaches, and then we
discuss the limitations of the diffusion models in the medical domain and
propose several directions to fulfill the demands of this field. Finally, we

decision-making agent is not able to model the full complexity of the world.
The environment is often much larger and more complex than the agent, a setting
also known as partial observability. In such settings, the agent must leverage
more than just the current sensory inputs; it must construct an agent state
that summarizes previous interactions with the world. Currently, a popular
approach for tackling this problem is to learn the agent-state function via a
recurrent network from the agent's sensory stream as input. Many impressive
reinforcement learning applications have instead relied on environment-specific
functions to aid the agent's inputs for history summarization. These
augmentations are done in multiple ways, from simple approaches like
concatenating observations to more complex ones such as uncertainty estimates.
Although ubiquitous in the field, these additional inputs, which we term
auxiliary inputs, are rarely emphasized, and it is not clear what their role or
impact is. In this work we explore this idea further, and relate these
auxiliary inputs to prior classic approaches to state construction. We present
a series of examples illustrating the different ways of using auxiliary inputs
for reinforcement learning. We show that these auxiliary inputs can be used to
discriminate between observations that would otherwise be aliased, leading to
more expressive features that smoothly interpolate between different states.
Finally, we show that this approach is complementary to state-of-the-art
methods such as recurrent neural networks and truncated back-propagation
through time, and acts as a heuristic that facilitates longer temporal credit
assignment, leading to better performance.

extract random sightlines to train our BGNN. We then evaluate the model on test

test set of 1,000 sightlines, the BGNN infers the individual $\kappa$
posteriors, which we combine in a hierarchical Bayesian model to yield

well sampled by the training set, the BGNN recovers the population mean of
$\kappa$ precisely and without bias, resulting in a contribution to the $H_0$

technology for space missions in low Earth orbits, which is difficult to solve
due to its initial value sensitivity, especially when the transfer trajectory
has many revolutions. This paper investigated the time-fixed perturbed orbit
rendezvous between low-eccentricity orbits and proposed a priori quasi-optimal
thrust strategy to simplify the problem into a parametric optimization problem,
which significantly reduces the complexity. The optimal trajectory is divided
into three stages including transfer to a certain intermediate orbit,
thrust-off drifting and transfer from intermediate orbit to the target orbit.
In the two transfer stages, the spacecraft is assumed to use a parametric law
of thrust. Then, the optimization model can be then obtained using very few
unknowns. Finally, a differential evolution algorithm is adopted to solve the
simplified optimization model and an analytical correction process is proposed
to eliminate the numerical errors. Simulation results and comparisons with
previous methods proved this new method's efficiency and high precision for
low-eccentricity orbits. The method can be well applied to premilitary analysis
and high-precision trajectory optimization of missions such as in-orbit service
and active debris removal in low Earth orbits.

in the crystallization of polymers. In the melt, polybutene-1 (PB-1) has the
lowest critical cooling rate in polyolefins and tends to maintain its original

It is proposed that this is due to the differences in the chain conformational

embark on a systematic study of the sparsification of stochastic packing
problems (SPP) more generally. Specifically, we consider SPPs where elements
are independently active with a probability p, and ask whether one can
(non-adaptively) compute a sparse set of elements guaranteed to contain an
approximately optimal solution to the realized (active) subproblem. We seek
structural and algorithmic results of broad applicability to such problems. Our
focus is on computing sparse sets containing on the order of d feasible
solutions to the packing problem, where d is linear or at most poly. in 1/p.
Crucially, we require d to be independent of the any parameter related to the
``size'' of the packing problem. We refer to d as the degree of the sparsifier,
as is consistent with graph theoretic degree in the special case of matching.
First, we exhibit a generic sparsifier of degree 1/p based on contention
resolution. This sparsifier's approximation ratio matches the best contention
resolution scheme (CRS) for any packing problem for additive objectives, and
approximately matches the best monotone CRS for submodular objectives. Second,
we embark on outperforming this generic sparsifier for matroids, their
intersections and weighted matching. These improved sparsifiers feature
different algorithmic and analytic approaches, and have degree linear in 1/p.
In the case of a single matroid, our sparsifier tends to the optimal solution.
For weighted matching, we combine our contention-resolution-based sparsifier
with technical approaches of prior work to improve the state of the art ratio
from 0.501 to 0.536. Third, we examine packing problems with submodular
objectives. We show that even the simplest such problems do not admit

operational strategy parameters of a grid-connected photovoltaic

hydrogen to store energy over a long time was also investigated. The proposed
method was applied to a real-world distributed energy project located in the
tropical climate zone. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of
the method, another synthetic test case was examined for a location in the
subtropical weather zone, which has a high seasonal mismatch. The performance
of the proposed MOMFA method is compared with the NSGA-II method, which has
been widely used to design renewable energy storage systems in the literature.
The result shows that MOMFA is more accurate and robust than NSGA-II owing to
the complex and dynamic nature of energy storage system. The optimisation
results show that battery storage systems, as a mature technology, yield better
economic performance than current hydrogen storage systems. However, it is
proven that hydrogen storage systems provide better techno-economic performance
and can be a viable long-term storage solution when high penetration of

increase the total economic performance of hydrogen storage systems. The
findings of this study can support the implementation of energy storage systems

Triphasic rhythms, in which each phase consists of a prolonged activation of a
corresponding subgroup of neurons followed by a fast transition to another
phase, represent a fundamental activity pattern observed across a range of
central pattern generators underlying behaviors critical to survival, including
respiration, locomotion, and feeding. To perform our analysis, we extend the
recently developed local timing response curve (lTRC), which allows us to
characterize the timing effects due to perturbations, and we complement our
lTRC approach with model-specific dynamical systems analysis. Interestingly, we
observe disparate effects of similar perturbations across distinct model

of the MS is due to the increased gas masses at earlier epochs while 30 percent
is due to increased efficiency of SF. For galaxies above the MS this is
reversed with 70 percent of the increased SFR relative to the MS being due to
elevated SFEs. Thus, the major evolution of star formation activity at early
epochs is driven by increased gas masses, while the starburst activity taking
galaxies above the MS is due to enhanced triggering of star formation (likely
due to galactic merging). The interstellar gas peaks at z = 2 and dominates the
stellar mass down to z = 1.2. Accretion rates needed to maintain continuity of
the MS evolution exceed 100 Msun per yr at z > 2. The galactic gas contents are
likely the driving determinant for both the rise in SF and AGN activity from z

that decouples the neighborhood aggregation and feature transformation in each
convolutional layer, has shown promising performance for graph representation
learning. Existing decoupled GCNs first utilize a simple neural network (e.g.,
MLP) to learn the hidden features of the nodes, then propagate the learned
features on the graph with fixed steps to aggregate the information of
multi-hop neighborhoods. Despite effectiveness, the aggregation operation,
which requires the whole adjacency matrix as the input, is involved in the
model training, causing high training cost that hinders its potential on larger
graphs. On the other hand, due to the independence of node attributes as the
input, the neural networks used in decoupled GCNs are very simple, and advanced
techniques cannot be applied to the modeling. To this end, we further liberate
the aggregation operation from the decoupled GCN and propose a new paradigm of
GCN, termed Neighborhood Convolutional Network (NCN), that utilizes the
neighborhood aggregation result as the input, followed by a special
convolutional neural network tailored for extracting expressive node
representations from the aggregation input. In this way, the model could
inherit the merit of decoupled GCN for aggregating neighborhood information, at
the same time, develop much more powerful feature learning modules. A training
strategy called mask training is incorporated to further boost the model
performance. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for
the node classification task on diverse homophilic graphs and heterophilic
graphs.

models with partial positive labels (MLR-PPL), in which merely few positive
labels are known while other are missing, attracts increasing attention. Due to
the absence of any negative labels, previous works regard unknown labels as
negative and adopt traditional MLR algorithms. To reject noisy labels, recent
works regard large loss samples as noise but ignore the semantic correlation
different multi-label images. In this work, we propose to explore semantic
correlation among different images to facilitate the MLR-PPL task.
Specifically, we design a unified framework, Category-Adaptive Label Discovery
and Noise Rejection, that discovers unknown labels and rejects noisy labels for
each category in an adaptive manner. The framework consists of two
complementary modules: (1) Category-Adaptive Label Discovery module first
measures the semantic similarity between positive samples and then complement
unknown labels with high similarities; (2) Category-Adaptive Noise Rejection
module first computes the sample weights based on semantic similarities from
different samples and then discards noisy labels with low weights. Besides, we
propose a novel category-adaptive threshold updating that adaptively adjusts
the threshold, to avoid the time-consuming manual tuning process. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms

see down to Venus' surface on the night side of the planet. The surface of our
sister planet has thus been imaged by sensors on Venus-orbiting platforms
(Venus Express, Akatsuki) and during fly-by with missions to other planets
(Galileo, Cassini). The most tantalizing finding, so far, is the hint of
possible active volcanism. However, the thermal radiation emitted by the
searing (c. 475 degrees C) surface of Venus has to get through the opaque
clouds between 50 and 70 km altitude, as well as the sub-cloud atmosphere. In
the clouds, the light is not absorbed but scattered, many times. This results
in blurring the surface imagery to the point where the smallest discernible
feature is roughly 100 km in size, full-width half-max (FWHM), and this has
been explained using numerical models. We describe a new analytical modeling
framework for predicting the width of the atmospheric point-spread function
(APSF), which is what determines the effective resolution of surface imaging
from space. Our best estimates of the APSF width for the 1-to-1.2 micron
spectral range are clustered around 130 km FWHM. Interestingly, this is
somewhat larger than the accepted value of about 100 km, which is based on

However, the resulting music similarity metric usually captures the entire

limiting the capability of the music recommendation system, e.g., it is
difficult to search for a musical piece containing similar drum sounds. Towards
the development of a more flexible music recommendation system, we propose a
music similarity calculation method that focuses on individual instrumental
sound sources in a musical piece. By fully exploiting the potential of
data-driven methods for our proposed method, we employ weakly supervised metric
learning to individual instrumental sound source signals without using any tag

by whether or not they are from the same musical piece. Furthermore, assuming
that each instrumental sound source is not always available in practice, we
also investigate the effects of using instrumental sound source separation to
obtain each source in the proposed method. Experimental results have shown that
(1) unique similarity metrics can be learned for individual instrumental sound
sources, (2) similarity metrics learned using some instrumental sound sources
are possible to lead to more accurate results than that learned using the

global model without disclosing their data. Existing research often requires
all model parameters to participate in the training procedure. However, with
the advent of powerful pre-trained models, it becomes possible to achieve
higher performance with fewer learnable parameters in FL. In this paper, we
propose a federated adaptive prompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for cross-domain
federated image classification scenarios with the vision-language pre-trained
model, CLIP, which gives play to the strong representation ability in FL.
Compared with direct federated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively
unlock specific domain knowledge for each test sample in order to provide them
with personalized prompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt
tuning module, which consists of a global prompt, an adaptive network, and some
keys. The server randomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to
each client. Then all clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network
and global prompt with the local datasets and the frozen keys. Ultimately, the
global aggregation model can assign a personalized prompt to CLIP based on the
domain features of each test sample. We perform extensive experiments on two
multi-domain image classification datasets. The results show that FedAPT can
achieve better performance with less than 10\% of the number of parameters of
the fully trained model, and the global model can perform well in different
client domains simultaneously.

255 hour treasury program conducted by the James Webb Space Telescope in its
first cycle of observations. COSMOS-Web is a contiguous 0.54 deg$^2$ NIRCam
imaging survey in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W) that will reach
5$\sigma$ point source depths ranging $\sim$27.5-28.2 magnitudes. In parallel,
we will obtain 0.19 deg$^2$ of MIRI imaging in one filter (F770W) reaching
5$\sigma$ point source depths of $\sim$25.3-26.0 magnitudes. COSMOS-Web will
build on the rich heritage of multiwavelength observations and data products
available in the COSMOS field. The design of COSMOS-Web is motivated by three
primary science goals: (1) to discover thousands of galaxies in the Epoch of
Reionization ($6<z<11$) and map reionization's spatial distribution,
environments, and drivers on scales sufficiently large to mitigate cosmic
variance, (2) to identify hundreds of rare quiescent galaxies at $z>4$ and
place constraints on the formation of the Universe's most massive galaxies
($M_\star>10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$), and (3) directly measure the evolution of the
stellar mass to halo mass relation using weak gravitational lensing out to
$z\sim2.5$ and measure its variance with galaxies' star formation histories and
morphologies. In addition, we anticipate COSMOS-Web's legacy value to reach far
beyond these scientific goals, touching many other areas of astrophysics, such
as the identification of the first direct collapse black hole candidates,
ultracool sub-dwarf stars in the Galactic halo, and possibly the identification
of $z>10$ pair-instability supernovae. In this paper we provide an overview of
the survey's key measurements, specifications, goals, and prospects for new
discovery.

is controlled by exploiting local temporal structures for adaptive network

estimation, where the upper bound of the estimation error in each iteration is
established. A thorough analysis is conducted to quantify the asymptotic
behavior of the proposed method, which shows that it can significantly reduce
the estimation error and also provides guideline for network merging under
various scenarios. We further demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method

of the type and distribution of TM on the piezoelectric response is discussed
for the first time. TM0.0625Al0.9375N with twenty-eight different TMs are
investigated, and most show higher values of piezoelectric strain modulus d33
than that of AlN. This is because the TM introduces weaker TM-N bonds and
locates closer to the centre of three neighbouring N atoms. The location of TM
is determined to be significantly correlated with its group number. Alloys of
TMxAl1-xN (TM=Sc, Cr, Sr, Mo, Ru and Rh) with varying x are further studied. On
basis of the cost of the TMs and piezoelectric performances, the alloy with Mo
is more effective in enhancing d33. A high d33 of 12.3 times that of pure AlN
is realized in a metastable configuration of Mo0.167Al0.833N. The distribution
of Mo plays a key role in the piezoelectric performance. A higher d33 is more
likely to appear in MoxAl1-xN with more Al sublayers containing Mo atoms and

  Satellite Communications",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Future satellite networks are expected to have thousands of low Earth orbit
(LEO) satellites orbiting Earth at very high speeds. User equipment (UE)
communicating directly with LEO satellites will experience frequent handovers.
Managing the handover process is complicated due to the high frequency of
handovers and the availability of multiple LEO satellites as handover targets.
In addition, as the status of the communication link between a UE and an LEO
satellite varies in accordance with the visibility period of the satellite,
initiating handovers at the right time will significantly affect the quality of
service (QoS) of the communication provided. To address this problem, this work
proposes a graph-based customizable handover framework that considers both the
handover timing and target while selecting a handover sequence that maintains
QoS. A time-based graph is designed where the vertices represent the
satellites' instances over a certain period of time and the edges' weights are
the customizable handover criteria (i.e., data rate and delay in this work).
The appropriate sequence and timing of handovers that fulfill the required QoS
are obtained by finding the shortest path in the graph. Discussion and
simulations, which were conducted on the Starlink Phase I constellation, show
the low complexity and performance advantages of the proposed handover
framework.

as a combination of building blocks. The core assumption of the model is that a
finite set of simple canonical flows contains the essential physics to predict
the wall-shear stress in more complex scenarios. The model is constructed to
predict zero/favourable/adverse mean pressure gradient wall turbulence,
separation, statistically unsteady turbulence with mean flow
three-dimensionality, and laminar flow. The approach is implemented using two
types of artificial neural networks: a classifier, which identifies the
contribution of each building block in the flow, and a predictor, which
estimates the wall-shear stress via combination of the building-block flows.
The training data are directly obtained from wall-modelled LES (WMLES)
optimised to reproduce the correct mean quantities. This approach guarantees
the consistency of the training data with the numerical discretisation and the
gridding strategy of the flow solver. The output of the model is accompanied by
a confidence score in the prediction that aids the detection of regions where
the model underperforms. The model is validated in canonical flows (e.g.
laminar/turbulent boundary layers, turbulent channels, turbulent
Poiseuille-Couette flow, turbulent pipe) and two realistic aircraft
configurations: the NASA Common Research Model High-lift and NASA Juncture Flow
experiment. It is shown that the building-block-flow wall model outperforms (or
matches) the predictions by an equilibrium wall model. It is also concluded
that further improvements in WMLES should incorporate advances in subgrid-scale
modelling to minimise error propagation to the wall model.

variations in the stellar flux. There are two limits for the dependence of the
inner habitable zone boundary (IHZ) on eccentricity: (1) the mean-stellar flux
approximation ($S_{\mbox{IHZ}} \propto \sqrt{1-e^2}$), in which the temperature
is approximately constant throughout the orbit, and (2) the maximum-stellar
flux approximation ($S_{\mbox{IHZ}} \propto (1-e)^2$), in which the temperature
adjusts instantaneously to the stellar flux. Which limit is appropriate is
determined by the dimensionless parameter $\Pi = \frac{C}{BP}$, where $C$ is
the heat capacity of the planet, $P$ is the orbital period, and
$B=\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial T_s}$, where $\Omega$ is the outgoing
longwave radiation and $T_s$ is the surface temperature. We use the Buckingham
$\Pi$ theorem to derive an analytical function for the IHZ in terms of
eccentricity and $\Pi$. We then build a time-dependent energy balance model to
resolve the surface temperature evolution and constrain our analytical result.
We find that $\Pi$ must be greater than about $\sim 1$ for the mean-stellar
flux approximation to be nearly exact and less than about $\sim 0.01$ for the
maximum-stellar flux approximation to be nearly exact. In addition to assuming
a constant heat capacity, we also consider the effective heat capacity
including latent heat (evaporation and precipitation). We find that for planets
with an Earth-like ocean, the IHZ should follow the mean-stellar flux limit for
all eccentricities. This work will aid in the prioritization of potentially
habitable exoplanets with non-zero eccentricity for follow-up characterization.

the mutual information between the target response matrix of a point radar
target and the echo signals, while ensuring the data rate requirements of the

caused by communication users on sensing performance, we study two scenarios: a
single communication user and multiple communication users. For the case of a
single communication user, we consider three types of echo interference, no
interference, a point interference, and an extended interference. For the case
of multiple communication users, the interference is also an extended one, and
furthermore, each user's communication rate requirement needs to be satisfied.
To find the optimal beamforming design in these problems, we provide a
closed-form solution with low complexiy, a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
method, a low-complexity algorithm based on the Majorization-Minimization (MM)
method and the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, and an algorithm
based on MM method and SCA method, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate

fixed point iteration along appropriately chosen direction functions. We
develop a computationally efficient method to evaluate these G\^ateaux
derivatives in conjunction with the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration
procedure, an approach widely used in large-scale Kohn-Sham DFT calculations.
Further, we propose a variant of LRDM preconditioner based on adaptive

extend the LRDM preconditioner to spin-polarized Kohn-Sham DFT calculations. We
demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the LRDM preconditioner against

with localized $d$ orbitals near the Fermi energy, nanofilm with metal dopants,
and magnetic systems. In all benchmark systems, the LRDM preconditioner
converges robustly within 20--30 iterations. In contrast, other widely used
preconditioners show slow convergence in many cases, as well as divergence of
the fixed point iteration in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate the
computational efficiency afforded by the LRDM method, with up to 3.4$\times$

thermometry techniques that work for wide range of materials and offer good
resolution in time, space and temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging can provide 3D temperature information.
However, XRD is typically limited to crystalline materials while NMR is largely
limited to liquids where the resonance lines are narrow. We investigate
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of n-type silicon and germanium for 3D
thermometry. While in germanium the EPR linewidths are too broad, EPR
linewidths in silicon are reasonably narrow and exhibit a strong temperature
dependence. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate
(1/T1) of conduction electrons in n-type Si for low dopant concentrations
follows a T^3 law due to phonon broadening. For heavily doped Si, which is
desirable for good signal to noise ratio (SNR) for application in thermometry,
impurity scattering is expected to decrease the temperature dependence of 1/T1.
Our results show, in heavily doped n-type Si, spin-lattice relaxation induced
by impurity scattering does not drastically decrease the temperature dependence
of EPR linewidths. In P-doped Si with donor concentration of 7 x 10^18 /cm^3,
the EPR linewidth has a T^(5/2) temperature dependence; the temperature
dependence decreases to T^(3/2) when the donor concentration is 7 x 10^19
/cm^3. While the temperature dependence of linewidth decreases for heavier
doping, EPR linewidth is still a sensitive thermometer. We define a figure of
merit for SNR for thermometry from EPR linewidths of n-type Si and observe that
increasing the doping results in a better SNR. Using effective medium theory,
we show that EPR linewidth can be a sensitive thermometer for application in 3D
thermometry with systems embedding microparticles of heavily doped n-type Si.

consistent with theoretical models of orbitally pulsed accretion streams
reaching from the inner disk edge to the central stars. From a joint analysis
of spectroscopically determined radial velocities and TESS light curves,
together with additional tight constraints provided by the SED and the Gaia

radii of 0.98 Rsun and 0.94 Rsun; and effective temperatures of 3750 K and 3645

measured radii are inflated, and the temperatures suppressed, relative to

been attracting numerous researchers to study the collective excitation and
propagation dynamics of different eigen-mode structures in diversifed
astrocosmic circumstances for years. It includes planetary rings,
interplanetary space, cometary tails, asteroid zones, planetary atmospheres,

dynamic freedom resulting in the excitation of relatively low-frequency modes,
such as dust-ion-acoustic waves (DIAWs), dust-acoustic waves (DAWs),
dust-Coulomb waves (DCWs), and so forth. An interesting prevalency of dusty
plasma stability research lies in the Jovian magnetosphere (i.e., Jovian
plasmas), embedded inside the supersonic solar wind. A brief review of the
updated research works on dust-acoustic waves and related collective
instability dynamics in the presence of trapped plasma particles is presented
herein. The key aim of the proposed explorative meta-analysis is rooted in
outlining concisely the main up-to-date investigations on such collective
instability processes chronologically. An especial attention is given primarily
to the thermostatistical distribution laws of the constitutive lighter
electrons and ions against the heavier positively charged dust grains
(microspheres). The trapping mechanism of both the lighter species

  Conditioned Average Structural Derivatives","75 pages",,,,"econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new class of heterogeneous causal quantities, named
\textit{outcome conditioned} average structural derivatives (OASD) in a general
nonseparable model. OASD is the average partial effect of a marginal change in
a continuous treatment on the individuals located at different parts of the
outcome distribution, irrespective of individuals' characteristics. OASD
combines both features of ATE and QTE: it is interpreted as straightforwardly
as ATE while at the same time more granular than ATE by breaking the entire
population up according to the rank of the outcome distribution.
  One contribution of this paper is that we establish some close relationships
between the \textit{outcome conditioned average partial effects} and a class of
parameters measuring the effect of counterfactually changing the distribution
of a single covariate on the unconditional outcome quantiles. By exploiting
such relationship, we can obtain root-$n$ consistent estimator and calculate
the semi-parametric efficiency bound for these counterfactual effect
parameters. We illustrate this point by two examples: equivalence between OASD
and the unconditional partial quantile effect (Firpo et al. (2009)), and
equivalence between the marginal partial distribution policy effect (Rothe
(2012)) and a corresponding outcome conditioned parameter.
  Because identification of OASD is attained under a conditional exogeneity
assumption, by controlling for a rich information about covariates, a
researcher may ideally use high-dimensional controls in data. We propose for
OASD a novel automatic debiased machine learning estimator, and present
asymptotic statistical guarantees for it. We prove our estimator is root-$n$
consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. We also
prove the validity of the bootstrap procedure for uniform inference on the OASD
process.

physics, chemistry and surface science due to its broad real world
applications. Much insights can be gained by observing the transition paths of
a particle through a channel and collecting statistics on the lifetimes in the
channel or the escape probabilities from the channel. In this paper, we
consider the diffusive transport through a narrow conical channel of a Brownian
particle subject to intermittent dynamics, namely, stochastic resetting. As
such, resetting brings the particle back to a desired location from where it
resumes its diffusive phase. To this end, we extend the Fick-Jacobs theory of
channel-facilitated diffusive transport to resetting-induced transport. Exact
expressions for the conditional mean first passage times, escape probabilities
and the total average lifetime in the channel are obtained, and their behaviour
as a function of the resetting rate are highlighted. It is shown that resetting
can expedite the transport through the channel -- rigorous constraints for such
conditions are then illustrated. Furthermore, we observe that a carefully
chosen resetting rate can render the average lifetime of the particle inside
the channel minimal. Interestingly, the optimal rate undergoes continuous and
discontinuous transitions as some relevant system parameters are varied. The
validity of our one-dimensional analysis and the corresponding theoretical
predictions are supported by three-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations.
We thus believe that resetting can be useful to facilitate particle transport
across biological membranes -- a phenomena that can spearhead further
theoretical and experimental studies.

network (RBFNN) is expected to make full use of the training samples such that
its learning accuracy and generalization capability are guaranteed. Since the
approximation capability of the RBFNN is finite, training methods with
forgetting mechanisms such as the forgetting factor recursive least squares
(FFRLS) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods are widely used to
maintain the learning ability of the RBFNN to new knowledge. However, with the
forgetting mechanisms, some useful knowledge will get lost simply because they
are learned a long time ago, which we refer to as the passive knowledge
forgetting phenomenon. To address this problem, this paper proposes a real-time
training method named selective memory recursive least squares (SMRLS) in which
the feature space of the RBFNN is evenly discretized into a finite number of
partitions and a synthesized objective function is developed to replace the
original objective function of the ordinary recursive least squares (RLS)
method. SMRLS is featured with a memorization mechanism that synthesizes the
samples within each partition in real-time into representative samples
uniformly distributed over the feature space, and thus overcomes the passive
knowledge forgetting phenomenon and improves the generalization capability of
the learned knowledge. Compared with the SGD or FFRLS methods, SMRLS achieves
improved learning performance (learning speed, accuracy and generalization
capability), which is demonstrated by corresponding simulation results.

EVM-compatible ones that serially execute transactions, still face the
significant challenge of limited throughput. Concurrent transaction execution
is a promising technique to accelerate transaction processing and increase the
overall throughput. Existing concurrency control algorithms, however, fail to
obtain enough speedups in real-world blockchains due to the high-contention
workloads.
  In this paper, we propose a novel operation-level concurrency control
algorithm designed for blockchains. The core idea behind our algorithm is that
only operations depending on conflicts should be executed serially, while all
other conflict-free operations can be executed concurrently. Therefore, in
contrast to the traditional approaches, which block or abort the entire
transaction when encountering conflicts, our algorithm introduces a redo phase
to resolve conflicts at the operation level by re-executing conflicting
operations only. We also develop a set of data dependency tracking mechanisms
to achieve precise identification and speedy re-execution for conflicting
operations. We implement an open-source prototype based on Go Ethereum and
evaluate it using real-world Ethereum blocks. The evaluation results show that
our algorithm achieves an average speedup of 4.28$\times$. If combined with
state prefetching techniques, our approach can further accelerate the

learning models as they can easily control the model's test-time predictions by
pre-injecting a backdoor trigger into the model at training time. While
backdoor attacks have been extensively studied on images, few works have
investigated the threat of backdoor attacks on time series data. To fill this
gap, in this paper we present a novel generative approach for time series
backdoor attacks against deep learning based time series classifiers. Backdoor
attacks have two main goals: high stealthiness and high attack success rate. We
find that, compared to images, it can be more challenging to achieve the two
goals on time series. This is because time series have fewer input dimensions
and lower degrees of freedom, making it hard to achieve a high attack success
rate without compromising stealthiness. Our generative approach addresses this
challenge by generating trigger patterns that are as realistic as real-time
series patterns while achieving a high attack success rate without causing a
significant drop in clean accuracy. We also show that our proposed attack is
resistant to potential backdoor defenses. Furthermore, we propose a novel
universal generator that can poison any type of time series with a single
generator that allows universal attacks without the need to fine-tune the

that update their states according to some rules. Discrete-time Boolean Finite
Dynamical System (DT-BFDS) is a subfield where the systems have some finite
number of objects whose states are Boolean values, and the state updates occur
in discrete time. In the subfield of DT-BFDS, researchers aim to (i) design
models for capturing real-world phenomena and using the models to make
predictions and (ii) develop simulation techniques for acquiring insights about
the systems' behavior. Useful for both aims is understanding the system
dynamics mathematically before executing the systems. Obtaining a mathematical
understanding of BFDS is quite challenging, even for simple systems, because
the state space of a system grows exponentially in the number of objects.
Researchers have used computational complexity to circumvent the challenge. The
complexity theoretic research in DT-BFDS has successfully produced complete
characterizations for many dynamical problems.
  The DT-BFDS studies have mainly dealt with deterministic models, where the
update at each time step is deterministic, so the system dynamics are
completely determinable from the initial setting. However, natural systems have
uncertainty. Models having uncertainty may lead to far-better understandings of
nature. Although a few attempts have explored DT-BFDS with uncertainty,
including stochastic initialization and tie-breaking, they have scratched only
a tiny surface of models with uncertainty. The introduction of uncertainty can
be through two schemes. One is the introduction of alternate update functions.
The other is the introduction of alternate update schedules. 37This paper
establishes a theory of models with uncertainty and proves some fundamental
results.

this paper, we introduce a generalized quantum metric(GQM) on the Brillouin

optical conductivity that is written by single-particle Green's functions. We
analytically prove that this definition is equivalent to the existing
definition of the quantum metric in noninteracting systems and that it is
positive semi-definite as necessary for a metric. Furthermore, we point out the
relationship between the GQM and the Chern number in interacting systems. We
then numerically confirm these properties of the GQM in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model
with and without interaction. We believe that the GQM will be a step toward
generalizing the quantum metric to the interacting regime.

pretraining is unsupervised, the lack of definable criteria for false negative

precise calibration of FNS. We achieve coarse determination of FNS by the FNS
self-determination (FNSD) strategy and achieve calibration of FNS by the FNS
confidence calibration (FNCC) loss function. Experimental results on three RSI
semantic segmentation datasets demonstrated that the FALSE effectively improves
the accuracy of the downstream RSI semantic segmentation task compared with the
current three models, which represent three different types of SSCL models. The
mean Intersection-over-Union on ISPRS Potsdam dataset is improved by 0.7\% on

requires the presence of expert teachers. Considering the complexity of the
problem, it is comparatively expensive to find skilled experts as the process

biased, the evaluation process is noisy and will lead to high variance in the
final score of different operators with similar skills. In this work, we
address these issues and propose a novel strategy for the automatic evaluation
of excavator operators. We take into account the internal dynamics of the
excavator and the safety criterion at every time step to evaluate the
performance. To further validate our approach, we use this score prediction
model as a source of reward for a reinforcement learning agent to learn the
task of maneuvering an excavator in a simulated environment that closely
replicates the real-world dynamics. For a policy learned using these external

required dynamic constraints when compared to policy trained with task-based

that if this program is true the brane-world scenario with the branon dark

In other words, the constraints of quantum gravity imply that the branons must
be absorbed by the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gauge bosons which are the off-diagonal
components of the bulk metric to become their longitudinal modes.
Interestingly, the KK gauge bosons behave as the DM and hence it leads to a
geometric unification of gravity and the DM, as a natural feature of the
brane-world scenario completed into quantum gravity in the ultraviolet. In

through them. Such non-stationary black hole horizons can be described using
viscous fluid equations. This work attempts to describe this process using
effective field theory methods. Such a description can provide important
insights beyond classical black hole physics. In this work, we construct a
low-energy effective field theory description for the horizon fluid of a
4-dimensional, asymptotically flat, Einstein black hole. The effective field
theory of the dynamical horizon has two ingredients: degrees of freedom
involved in the interaction with external fields and symmetry. The dual
requirements of incorporating near-horizon symmetries (${\cal S}1$
diffeomorphism) and possessing length scales due to external perturbations is
naturally satisfied if the theory on the non-stationary black hole horizon is a
deformed Conformal Field Theory (CFT). For the homogeneous external
perturbations, at the lowest order, this leads to $(2 + 1)-$dimensional massive
scalar field where the mass is related to the extent of the deformation of the
CFT. We determine the mass by obtaining the correlation function corresponding
to the effective field and relating it to the bulk viscosity of the horizon
fluid. Additionally, we show that the coefficient of bulk viscosity of the
horizon fluid determines the time required for black holes to scramble.
Furthermore, we argue that matter-field modes with energy less than $m_{\rm
eff}$ falling into the horizon thermalize more slowly. Finally, we construct a
microscopic toy model for the horizon fluid that reduces to the effective field
theory with a single scalar degree of freedom. We then discuss the usefulness
of the effective field model in understanding how information escapes from a

displays some degree of ``completeness'' as a measure of multi-particle quantum

mixed-autonomy traffic of different densities to efficiently and safely pass
the non-signalized intersection with fairish fuel consumption. Implementation
tricks including network-level improvements, Q value update by TD ($\lambda$),
and reward clipping operation are added to the pure QMIX framework, which is
expected to improve the convergence speed and the asymptotic performance of the

convergence speed and asymptotic performance can exceed that of the original
QMIX and the proximal policy optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art

Moreover, CAVs under the lower traffic flow controlled by our method can
improve their average speed without collisions and consume the least fuel. The
training is additionally conducted under the doubled traffic density, where the
learning reward converges. Consequently, the model with maximal reward and
minimum crashes can still guarantee low fuel consumption, but slightly reduce
the efficiency of vehicles and induce more collisions than the lower-traffic

the tri-plane to represent the high-level appearance of its corresponding
facial volume. Moreover, we leverage a generated 3D-continuous semantic mask as
an intermediary for geometry editing. We devise a geometry decoder (whose
output is unchanged when the appearance changes) and an appearance decoder. The
geometry decoder aligns the original facial volume with the semantic mask
volume. We also enhance the disentanglement by explicitly regularizing rendered
images with the same appearance but different geometry to be similar in terms
of color distribution for each facial component separately. Our method allows
users to edit via semantic masks with decoupled control of geometry and

Multi-Neighborhood Attention based Graph Transformer (MNA-GT), which captures
the graph structural information for each node from the multi-neighborhood
attention mechanism adaptively. By defining the input to perform scaled-dot

based on different hops of neighborhoods such that each attention kernel can
capture specific graph structural information of the corresponding neighborhood
for each node pair. In this way, MNA-GT can preserve the graph structural

claimed highly diverse values for the rotation period for the dwarf planet
Eris, ranging from a few hours to a rotation (nearly) synchronous with the
orbital period (15.8 d) of its satellite, Dysnomia. In this letter we present
new light curve data of Eris, taken with $\sim$1-2m-class ground based
telescopes, and with the TESS and Gaia space telescopes. TESS data could not
provide a well-defined light curve period, but could constrain light curve
variations to a maximum possible light curve amplitude of $\Delta m$ $\leq$
0.03 mag (1-$\sigma$) for P $\leq$ 24 h periods. Both the combined ground-based
data and the Gaia measurements unambiguously point to a light curve period
equal to the orbital period of Dysnomia, P = 15.8 d, with a light curve
amplitude of $\Delta m$ $\approx$ 0.03 mag, i.e. the rotation of Eris is
tidally locked. Assuming that Dysnomia has a collisional origin, calculations
with a simple tidal evolution model show that Dysnomia has to be relatively
massive (mass ratio of q = 0.01--0.03) and large (radius of $R_s$ $\geq$ 300
km) to slow down Eris to synchronized rotation. These simulations also indicate
that -- assuming tidal parameters usually considered for transneptunian objects

and Zener tunneling in two-band lattices under an external dc force, are
ubiquitous in different areas of wave physics, including photonics. While in
Hermitian systems such oscillations are rather generally aperiodic and only
accidentally periodic, in non-Hermitian (NH) lattices BZO can show a transition
from aperiodic to periodic as a NH parameter in the system is varied.
Remarkably, the phase transition can be either smooth or sharp, contrary to
other types of NH phase transitions which are universally sharp. A
discrete-time photonic quantum walk on a synthetic lattice is suggested for an
experimental observation of smooth BZO phase transitions.

In the first part we consider
McKean-Vlasov Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), obtained as thermodynamic
limits of interacting particle systems (i.e. in the limit $N\to\infty$, where N
is the number of particles). It is well-known that, even when the particle
system has a unique invariant measure (stationary solution), the limiting PDE
very often displays a phase transition: for certain choices of (coefficients
and) parameter values, the PDE has a unique stationary solution, but as the
value of the parameter varies multiple stationary states appear. In the first
part of this paper, we add to this stream of literature and consider a specific
instance of a McKean-Vlasov type equation, namely the Kuramoto model on the
torus perturbed by a symmetric double-well potential, and show that this PDE
undergoes the type of phase transition just described, as the diffusion
coefficient is varied. In the second part of the paper, we consider a rather
general class of McKean-Vlasov PDEs on the torus (which includes both the
original Kuramoto model and the Kuramoto model in double well potential of part
one) perturbed by (strong enough) infinite-dimensional additive noise. To the
best of our knowledge, the resulting Stochastic PDE, which we refer to as the
Stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation, has not been studied before, so we first
study its well-posedness. We then show that the addition of noise to the PDE
has the effect of restoring uniqueness of the stationary state in the sense
that, irrespective of the choice of coefficients and parameter values in the
McKean-Vlasov PDE, the Stochastic McKean-Vlasov PDE always admits at most one
invariant measure.

based on the distance between a probe sample and the identities in the gallery.
However, existing methods often neglect that the gallery may not contain
identities corresponding to the probes, leading to recognition errors rather
than raising an alarm. In this paper, we introduce a novel uncertainty-aware
gait recognition method that models the uncertainty of identification based on
learned evidence. Specifically, we treat our recognition model as an evidence
collector to gather evidence from input samples and parameterize a Dirichlet
distribution over the evidence. The Dirichlet distribution essentially
represents the density of the probability assigned to the input samples. We
utilize the distribution to evaluate the resultant uncertainty of each probe
sample and then determine whether a probe has a counterpart in the gallery or
not. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first attempt to tackle
gait recognition with uncertainty modelling. Moreover, our uncertain modeling
significantly improves the robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD)
queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on datasets with OOD queries, and can also
generalize well to other identity-retrieval tasks. Importantly, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of 44.19% when the OOD query

to their input data. Ensemble defenses, which are trained to minimize attack
transferability among sub-models, offer a promising research direction to
improve robustness against such attacks while maintaining a high accuracy on
natural inputs. We discover, however, that recent state-of-the-art (SOTA)
adversarial attack strategies cannot reliably evaluate ensemble defenses,
sizeably overestimating their robustness. This paper identifies the two factors
that contribute to this behavior. First, these defenses form ensembles that are
notably difficult for existing gradient-based method to attack, due to gradient
obfuscation. Second, ensemble defenses diversify sub-model gradients,
presenting a challenge to defeat all sub-models simultaneously, simply summing
their contributions may counteract the overall attack objective; yet, we
observe that ensemble may still be fooled despite most sub-models being
correct. We therefore introduce MORA, a model-reweighing attack to steer
adversarial example synthesis by reweighing the importance of sub-model
gradients. MORA finds that recent ensemble defenses all exhibit varying degrees
of overestimated robustness. Comparing it against recent SOTA white-box
attacks, it can converge orders of magnitude faster while achieving higher
attack success rates across all ensemble models examined with three different
ensemble modes (i.e., ensembling by either softmax, voting or logits). In
particular, most ensemble defenses exhibit near or exactly 0% robustness
against MORA with $\ell^\infty$ perturbation within 0.02 on CIFAR-10, and 0.01

there is an increasing need to model and learn the representations of the
neural networks themselves. These models can be used to estimate attributes of
different neural network architectures such as the accuracy and latency,
without running the actual training or inference tasks. In this paper, we
propose a neural architecture representation model that can be used to estimate
these attributes holistically. Specifically, we first propose a simple and
effective tokenizer to encode both the operation and topology information of a
neural network into a single sequence. Then, we design a multi-stage fusion
transformer to build a compact vector representation from the converted
sequence. For efficient model training, we further propose an information flow
consistency augmentation and correspondingly design an architecture consistency
loss, which brings more benefits with less augmentation samples compared with
previous random augmentation strategies. Experiment results on NAS-Bench-101,
NAS-Bench-201, DARTS search space and NNLQP show that our proposed framework
can be used to predict the aforementioned latency and accuracy attributes of
both cell architectures and whole deep neural networks, and achieves promising
performance. Code is available at https://github.com/yuny220/NAR-Former.

  Pre-trained Transformers",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CL cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables distributed
users to collaboratively and iteratively train machine learning models without
sharing their private data. Motivated by the effectiveness and robustness of
self-attention-based architectures, researchers are turning to using
pre-trained Transformers (i.e., foundation models) instead of traditional
convolutional neural networks in FL to leverage their excellent transfer
learning capabilities. Despite recent progress, how pre-trained Transformer
models play a role in FL remains obscure, that is, how to efficiently fine-tune
these pre-trained models in FL and how FL users could benefit from this new
paradigm. In this paper, we explore this issue and demonstrate that the
fine-tuned Transformers achieve extraordinary performance on FL, and that the
lightweight fine-tuning method facilitates a fast convergence rate and low
communication costs. Concretely, we conduct a rigorous empirical study of three
tuning methods (i.e., modifying the input, adding extra modules, and adjusting
the backbone) using two types of pre-trained models (i.e., vision-language
models and vision models) for FL. Our experiments show that 1) Fine-tuning the
bias term of the backbone performs best when relying on a strong pre-trained
model; 2) The vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) outperforms the pure vision
model (e.g., ViT) and is more robust to the few-shot settings; 3) Compared to
pure local training, FL with pre-trained models has a higher accuracy because
it alleviates the problem of over-fitting. We will release our code and
encourage further exploration of pre-trained Transformers and FL.

handling logical tasks in reactive environments. However, existing approaches
suffer from the heavy computational burden, especially for tasks with large

still use the standard shrink horizon MPC framework with Mixed Integer Linear

instead of applying MPC directly for the entire task horizon, we decompose the
STL formula into several sub-formulae with disjoint time horizons, and
shrinking horizon MPC is applied for each short-horizon sub-formula
iteratively. To guarantee the satisfaction of the entire STL formula and to
ensure the recursive feasibility of the iterative process, we introduce new
terminal constraints to connect each sub-formula. We show how these terminal
constraints can be computed by an effective inner-approximation approach. The
computational efficiency of our approach is illustrated by a case study.

chirality via strong coupling of the optical modes of chiral nanostructures
with excitonic transitions in molecular layers or semiconductors. With
chirality being omnipresent in chemistry and biomedicine, and highly desirable
for technological applications related to efficient light manipulation, the
design of nanophotonic architectures that sense the handedness of molecules or
generate the desired light polarization in an externally controllable manner is
of major interdisciplinary importance. Here we propose that such capabilities
can be provided by the mode splitting resulting from polaritonic hybridization.
Starting with an object with well-known chiroptical response -- here, for a
proof of concept, a chiral sphere -- we show that strong coupling with a nearby
excitonic material generates two distinct frequency regions that retain the
object's chirality density and handedness, which manifest most clearly through
anticrossings in circular-dichroism or differential-scattering dispersion
diagrams. These windows can be controlled by the intrinsic properties of the
excitonic layer and the strength of the interaction, enabling thus the
post-fabrication manipulation of optical chirality. Our findings are further
verified via simulations of the circular dichroism of a realistic chiral
architecture, namely a helical assembly of plasmonic nanospheres embedded in a
resonant matrix.

in the $b$-quark sector, can be overcome if multiquark intermediate states are
involved in the decay chain, allowing for transitions to the final-state heavy
quarkonia with a different spin $S^{\prime}$. In particular, the measured
decays $\Upsilon(10860)\to \pi Z_b^{(\prime)} \to \pi\pi\Upsilon(nS)$
$(n=1,2,3)$ and $\Upsilon(10860)\to \pi Z_b^{(\prime)} \to \pi\pi h_b(mP)$

explained by a simultaneous presence of both $S_{b\bar{b}}=0$ and

shares. Meanwhile, the destructive interference between the contributions of
the $Z_b$ and $Z_b'$ to the decay amplitude for a $\pi\pi h_b$ final state
kills the signal to zero in the strict HQSS limit. In this paper, we discuss
how the HQSS violation needs to be balanced by the narrowness of the
$Z_b^{(\prime)}$ states in the physical case, to allow for equal transition
strengths into final states with different total heavy quark spins, and how
spin symmetry is restored as a result of a subtle interplay of the scales
involved, when the mass of a heavy quark becomes infinite. Moreover, we
demonstrate how similar branching fractions of the decays into $\pi\pi h_b$ and
$\pi\pi\Upsilon$ can be obtained and how the mentioned HQSS breaking can be
reconciled with the dispersive approach to the $\pi\pi/ K\bar K$ interaction in

density than the recent experiment by Astrath et al. [Light Sci. Appl. 11, 103

difference by developing a time-dependent covariant theory of optical force
densities in photonic materials. When a light pulse propagates in a bulk
dielectric, the field-induced force density consists of two parts: (i) The
optical wave momentum force density carries the wave momentum of light and
drives forward a mass density wave of the covariant coupled field-material
state of light. (ii) The optostrictive force density arises from the atomic
density dependence of the electric and magnetic field energy densities. It
represents an optical Lorentz-force-law-based generalization of the electro-
and magnetostrictive force densities well known for static electromagnetic
fields and derived from the principle of virtual work. Since the work done by
the optostrictive force density is not equal to the change of the field energy
density during the contraction of the material, we have to describe this
difference by optostriction-related dissipation terms to fulfill the energy
conservation. The detailed physical model of the dissipation is left for
further works. The optostrictive force density can be understood in terms of
field-induced pair interactions inside the material. Because of the related
action and reaction effects, this force density cannot contribute to the net
momentum transfer of the optical field. We also use the theory to simulate the
propagation of a Gaussian light pulse through a dielectric material.

the geoscience and remote sensing realm. Nevertheless, the security and
robustness of deep learning models deserve special attention when addressing
safety-critical remote sensing tasks. In this paper, we provide a systematic
analysis of backdoor attacks for remote sensing data, where both scene
classification and semantic segmentation tasks are considered. While most of
the existing backdoor attack algorithms rely on visible triggers like squared
patches with well-designed patterns, we propose a novel wavelet transform-based
attack (WABA) method, which can achieve invisible attacks by injecting the
trigger image into the poisoned image in the low-frequency domain. In this way,
the high-frequency information in the trigger image can be filtered out in the
attack, resulting in stealthy data poisoning. Despite its simplicity, the
proposed method can significantly cheat the current state-of-the-art deep
learning models with a high attack success rate. We further analyze how
different trigger images and the hyper-parameters in the wavelet transform
would influence the performance of the proposed method. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks
and thus highlight the importance of designing advanced backdoor defense
algorithms to address this threat in remote sensing scenarios. The code will be
available online at \url{https://github.com/ndraeger/waba}.

like advanced encryption standard (AES) crypto cores. Given the significant
impact of supply voltages (VCCs) on power profiles, various countermeasures
based on VCC tuning have been proposed, among other defense strategies. Driver
strengths of cells, however, have been largely overlooked, despite having
direct and significant impact on power profiles as well.
  For the first time, we thoroughly explore the prospects of jointly tuning
driver strengths and VCCs as novel working principle for PSC-attack
countermeasures. Toward this end, we take the following steps: 1) we develop a
simple circuit-level scheme for tuning; 2) we implement a CAD flow for
design-time evaluation of ASICs, enabling security assessment of ICs before
tape-out; 3) we implement a correlation power analysis (CPA) framework for
thorough and comparative security analysis; 4) we conduct an extensive
experimental study of a regular AES design, implemented in ASIC as well as FPGA
fabrics, under various tuning scenarios; 5) we summarize design guidelines for
secure and efficient joint tuning.
  In our experiments, we observe that runtime tuning is more effective than
static tuning, for both ASIC and FPGA implementations. For the latter, the AES
core is rendered >11.8x (i.e., at least 11.8 times) as resilient as the untuned
baseline design. Layout overheads can be considered acceptable, with, e.g.,
around +10% critical-path delay for the most resilient tuning scenario in FPGA.
  We will release source codes for our methodology, as well as artifacts from
the experimental study, post peer-review.

used to augment each LiDAR point in the subsequent 3D detection network to
guide and improve detection performance. PAI3D outperforms the state-of-the-art

risk measures may change when, to reflect the earth's changing climate, models
are made time dependent. Historical random sum equations by Wald (1945) and
Blackwell and Girshick (1947) are used to develop a relationship between the
frequency of events and the aggregate risk.
  The covariance between the occurrence of events and aggregate risk is found
to be the product of the expected value of the aggregate risk and the
dispersion statistic. Furthermore, a new equation (the ""J-equation"") relates
the correlation between the frequency of events and aggregate risk to the shape
of the distribution of storm intensities and the dispersion statistic. This
equation highlights that the correlation between the two variables is invariant
to a change in the scale of the severity distribution. The theory is applied to
a simulated future dataset from the 2020 Norwegian climate model NorESM2-LM. As
the data observes the theory presented, this opens the door for these results
to be applied to wider geographical regions in future studies.

knowledge to improve performance on a set of tasks that involve a physical
mechanism. We systematically review the recent development of physics-informed
machine learning from three perspectives of machine learning tasks,
representation of physical prior, and methods for incorporating physical prior.
We also propose several important open research problems based on the current
trends in the field. We argue that encoding different forms of physical prior
into model architectures, optimizers, inference algorithms, and significant
domain-specific applications like inverse engineering design and robotic
control is far from being fully explored in the field of physics-informed
machine learning. We believe that the interdisciplinary research of
physics-informed machine learning will significantly propel research progress,
foster the creation of more effective machine learning models, and also offer
invaluable assistance in addressing long-standing problems in related
disciplines.

investigated by choosing some reference theories for a given target theory

constraints on EFTs, e.g., the single massless scalar field with the
dimension-eight operator, and SMEFT dimension-eight $SU(N)$ gauge bosonic
operators, are consistent with the positivity bounds from the unitarity and
causality when the higher-derivative operators are generated by the interaction
between heavy and light fields. The constraints on Einstein-Maxwell theory with
higher-derivative operators from the non-negativity of relative entropy are
also investigated. The constraints on such EFTs from the relative entropy hold
under an assumption that perturbative corrections from the interaction
involving higher-derivative operators of light fields are not dominant in the
EFTs. The consequence of this study on the weak gravity conjecture and the
second law of thermodynamics is also discussed.

this article, we perform a model-independent search of a gamma-ray signal from
the direction of nine nearby BDs in 13 years of \Fermi-LAT data. We find no
significant excess of gamma rays, and we, therefore, set 95\% confidence level
upper limits on the gamma-ray flux with a binned-likelihood approach. In the
second part of the paper, we interpret these bounds within an exotic mechanism
proposed for gamma-ray production in BDs: If the dark matter (DM) of the
universe is constituted of particles with non-negligible couplings to the
standard model, BDs may efficiently accumulate them through scatterings. DM
particles eventually thermalize, and can annihilate into light, long-lived,
mediators which later decay into photons outside the BD. Within this framework,
we set a stacked upper limit on the DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross section
at the level $\sim 10^{-38}$ cm$^{2}$ for DM masses below 10 GeV. Our limits
are comparable to similar bounds from the capture of DM particles in celestial
objects, but have the advantage of covering a larger portion of the parameter
space in mediator decay length and DM mass. They also depend only on the local
DM abundance, as opposed to the inner Galaxy profile, and are thus more robust.

for adapting GNNs in various safety-critical applications. In this work, we
focus on the emerging but critical attack, namely, Graph Injection Attack(GIA),
in which the adversary poisons the graph by injecting fake nodes instead of
modifying existing structures or node attributes. Inspired by findings that the
adversarial attacks are related to the increased heterophily on perturbed
graphs (the adversary tends to connect dissimilar nodes), we propose a general
defense framework CHAGNN against GIA through cooperative homophilous
augmentation of graph data and model. Specifically, the model generates
pseudo-labels for unlabeled nodes in each round of training to reduce
heterophilous edges of nodes with distinct labels. The cleaner graph is fed
back to the model, producing more informative pseudo-labels. In such an
iterative manner, model robustness is then promisingly enhanced. We present the
theoretical analysis of the effect of homophilous augmentation and provide the
guarantee of the proposal's validity. Experimental results empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of CHAGNN in comparison with recent
state-of-the-art defense methods on diverse real-world datasets.

demonstrate that the physical properties of ErCo$_{2}$ are significantly

the phase transition changes from first order to second order. The thermal
annealing shifts the transition temperature back to the original one and

While knowledge distillation has been well-studied in classic detectors, there
is a lack of researches on how to make it work effectively on DETR. We first
provide experimental and theoretical analysis to point out that the main
challenge in DETR distillation is the lack of consistent distillation points.
Distillation points refer to the corresponding inputs of the predictions for
student to mimic, and reliable distillation requires sufficient distillation
points which are consistent between teacher and student. Based on this
observation, we propose a general knowledge distillation paradigm for
DETR(KD-DETR) with consistent distillation points sampling. Specifically, we
decouple detection and distillation tasks by introducing a set of specialized
object queries to construct distillation points. In this paradigm, we further
propose a general-to-specific distillation points sampling strategy to explore
the extensibility of KD-DETR. Extensive experiments on different DETR
architectures with various scales of backbones and transformer layers validate
the effectiveness and generalization of KD-DETR. KD-DETR boosts the performance
of DAB-DETR with ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 backbone to 41.4$\%$, 45.7$\%$ mAP,

Practitioners often face an important issue known as vendor lock-in caused by

involve these tools also requires investment. These issues could be addressed
by standardizing service interfaces to facilitate their integration. Linked
Data is an attractive choice for implementing such a standard without
sacrificing versatility. An exciting and promising proposal in this direction
is the OSLC standard specification. Its purpose is to build an environment

we focus on single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data instead of bulk data.
Recent advance in scRNA-seq has provided a way to investigate lncRNA regulation
at single-cell level. We will propose a novel computational method, CSlncR
(cell-specific lncRNA regulation), which combines putative lncRNA-mRNA binding
information with scRNA-seq data including lncRNAs and mRNAs to identify
cell-specific lncRNA-mRNA regulation networks at individual cells. To
understand lncRNA regulation at different development stages, we apply CSlncR
to the scRNA-seq data of human neocortex. Network analysis shows that the
lncRNA regulation is unique in each cell from the different human neocortex
development stages. The comparison results indicate that CSlncR is also an
effective tool for predicting cell-specific lncRNA targets and clustering
single cells, which helps understand cell-cell communication.

how well a system manages to tie a question and its answer to relevant image
regions. Systems with strong VG are considered intuitively interpretable and
suggest an improved scene understanding. While VQA accuracy performances have
seen impressive gains over the past few years, explicit improvements to VG
performance and evaluation thereof have often taken a back seat on the road to
overall accuracy improvements. A cause of this originates in the predominant
choice of learning paradigm for VQA systems, which consists of training a
discriminative classifier over a predetermined set of answer options.
  In this work, we break with the dominant VQA modeling paradigm of
classification and investigate VQA from the standpoint of an information
retrieval task. As such, the developed system directly ties VG into its core
search procedure. Our system operates over a weighted, directed, acyclic graph,
a.k.a. ""lattice"", which is derived from the scene graph of a given image in
conjunction with region-referring expressions extracted from the question.
  We give a detailed analysis of our approach and discuss its distinctive
properties and limitations. Our approach achieves the strongest VG performance
among examined systems and exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities in

is still challenging. Self shadows are shadows that are cast on the object
itself. Most existing methods rely on binary shadow masks, without considering
the ambiguous boundaries of soft and self shadows. In this paper, we present
DeS3, a method that removes hard, soft and self shadows based on the self-tuned
ViT feature similarity and color convergence. Our novel ViT similarity loss
utilizes features extracted from a pre-trained Vision Transformer. This loss
helps guide the reverse diffusion process towards recovering scene structures.
We also introduce a color convergence loss to constrain the surface colors in
the reverse inference process to avoid any color shifts. Our DeS3 is able to
differentiate shadow regions from the underlying objects, as well as shadow
regions from the object casting the shadow. This capability enables DeS3 to
better recover the structures of objects even when they are partially occluded
by shadows. Different from existing methods that rely on constraints during the
training phase, we incorporate the ViT similarity and color convergence loss
during the sampling stage. This enables our DeS3 model to effectively integrate
its strong modeling capabilities with input-specific knowledge in a self-tuned
manner. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the SRD, AISTD,
LRSS, USR and UIUC datasets, removing hard, soft, and self shadows robustly.
Specifically, our method outperforms the SOTA method by 20% of the RMSE of the

HV-convex polyominoes works usually in two steps, first the filling step

switching components. We prove three results about the convex aggregation step:
(1) The convex aggregation step used for the reconstruction of HV-convex
polyominoes does not always provide a solution. The example yielding to this

(2) The reconstruction of a digital convex lattice set from only one X-ray can
be performed in polynomial time. We prove it by encoding the convex aggregation
problem in a Directed Acyclic Graph. (3) With the same strategy, we prove that
the reconstruction of fat digital convex sets from their horizontal and
vertical X-rays can be solved in polynomial time. Fatness is a property of the
digital convex sets regarding the relative position of the left, right, top and
bottom points of the set. The complexity of the reconstruction of the lattice

tracer of the dark matter halo mass function (HMF). The $\Lambda$ cold dark
matter model predicts that the HMF should be identical everywhere provided it
is sampled in sufficiently large volumes, implying that the same should be true
of the HIWF. The ALFALFA 21-cm survey measured the HIWF in northern and
southern Galactic fields and found a systematically higher number density in
the north. At face value, this is in tension with theoretical predictions. We
use the Sibelius-DARK N-body simulation and the semi-analytical galaxy
formation model GALFORM to create a mock ALFALFA survey. We find that the
offset in number density has two origins: the sensitivity of the survey is
different in the two fields, which has not been correctly accounted for in
previous measurements; and the $1/V_{\mathrm{eff}}$ algorithm used for
completeness corrections does not fully account for biases arising from spatial
clustering in the galaxy distribution. The latter is primarily driven by a
foreground overdensity in the northern field within $30\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, but
more distant structure also plays a role. We provide updated measurements of
the ALFALFA HIWF (and HIMF) correcting for the variations in survey
sensitivity. Only when systematic effects such as these are understood and

proposed to improve the performance in unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.
However, a typical UDA task is usually challenged by dynamically changing
factors, such as variable weather, views, and background in the unlabeled
target domain. Most previous ensemble strategies ignore UDA's dynamic and
uncontrollable challenge, facing limited feature representations and
performance bottlenecks. To enhance the model, adaptability between domains and
reduce the computational cost when deploying the ensemble model, we propose a
novel framework, namely Instance aware Model Ensemble With Distillation, IMED,
which fuses multiple UDA component models adaptively according to different
instances and distills these components into a small model. The core idea of
IMED is a dynamic instance aware ensemble strategy, where for each instance, a
nonlinear fusion subnetwork is learned that fuses the extracted features and
predicted labels of multiple component models. The nonlinear fusion method can
help the ensemble model handle dynamically changing factors. After learning a
large capacity ensemble model with good adaptability to different changing
factors, we leverage the ensemble teacher model to guide the learning of a
compact student model by knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we provide the
theoretical analysis of the validity of IMED for UDA. Extensive experiments
conducted on various UDA benchmark datasets, e.g., Office 31, Office Home, and
VisDA 2017, show the superiority of the model based on IMED to the state of the
art methods under the comparable computation cost.

such a set. However, if we ask the set to be equal to the closure of its

absolutely continuous distributions includes strictly the class of $r$-convex

structureless surface. The molecules are made up of two mesogenic units linked
by a spacer, all of which are modeled as hard needles of the same length. Each
molecule can dynamically adopt two conformational states: an achiral
bent-shaped (cis-) and a chiral zigzag (trans-) one.
  Using constant pressure Monte Carlo simulations and Onsager-type density
functional theory (DFT), we show that the system consisting of these molecules
exhibits a rich spectrum of (quasi-)liquid crystalline phases. The most
interesting observation is the identification of stable smectic splay-bend
($S_{SB}$) and chiral smectic A ($S_A^*$) phases. The $S_{SB}$ phase is also
stable in the limit, where only cis-conformers are allowed. The second phase
occupying a considerable portion of the phase diagram is $S_A^*$ with chiral
layers, where the chirality of the neighboring layers is of opposite sign. The
study of the average fractions of the trans- and cis-conformers in various
phases shows that while in the isotropic phase all fractions are equally
populated, the $S_A^*$ phase is dominated by chiral conformers (zigzag), but
the achiral conformers win in the smectic splay-bend phase. To clarify the
possibility of stabilization of the nematic splay bend ($N_{SB}$) phase for
trimers, the free energy of the $N_{SB}$ and $S_{SB}$ phases is calculated
within DFT for the cis-conformers, for densities where simulations show stable
$S_{SB}$. It turns out that the $N_{SB}$ phase is unstable away from the phase
transition to the nematic phase, and its free energy is always higher than that
of $S_{SB}$, down to the transition to the nematic phase, although the
difference in free energies becomes extremely small when approaching the

pre-trained language models have been shown unstable during fine-tuning with
small datasets, and their embeddings are not semantically meaningful. In this

concept of Mott insulator, from which various other correlated phases derive.
The advent of two-dimensional (2D) materials brings unprecedented opportunities
to the study of strongly correlated physics in the 2D limit. In particular, the
enhanced correlation and extreme tunability of 2D materials enables exploring
strongly correlated systems across uncharted parameter space. Here, we discover
an intriguing metal to Mott insulator transition in 1T-TaSe$_2$ as the material
is thinned down to atomic thicknesses. Specifically, we discover, for the first

energy of the initially itinerant electrons and drives the material into a Mott
insulating state. The dimensionality-driven Metal to Mott insulator transition
resolves the long-standing dichotomy between metallic bulk and insulating

parameters: the strength $\epsilon_{LS}$ of the solid-liquid interaction energy
and the strength $\epsilon_{LL}$ of the liquid-liquid interaction energy. The
contact with the solid surface modifies the structure of the adjacent liquid.
Depending on the magnitude of the parameters $\epsilon_{LS}$ and
$\epsilon_{LL}$ the density of the liquid oscillates with the distance from the
surface for as far as five atomic layers. For other values of the parameters
the density of the liquid near the surface is much lower than that of the bulk
liquid, a process sometimes called dewetting. To describe the desorption rate
we have determined the number $N(t)$ of atoms that were adsorbed initially and
are still adsorbed at time $t$. The average of this quantity decays
exponentially and this allows us to define a desorption rate coefficient
$k_{d}$. We found that $k_{d}$ satisfies the Arrhenius relation. The logarithm
of the pre-exponential is a linear function of the activation energy (the
so-called compensation effect). We have also examined two approximate
mean-field like theories of the rate constant: one calculates the activation
free energy for desorption; the other uses transition state theory applied to
the potential of mean force. Both methods fail to reproduce the exact
desorption rate constant $k_{d}$. We show that this failure is due to the
presence of substantial recrossing of the barrier (which introduces errors in

including correlation-based methods (CMs) and minimum-mean-square-error-based

spatial resolution are provided, and thus the theoretical performance limits of
the two PPE methods and their differences are clarified. The derived equations
indicate that the estimated power profiles of CMs can be understood as the
convolution of a true power profile and a smoothing function. Consequently, the
spatial resolution and measurement accuracy of CMs are limited, even under
noiseless and distortionless conditions. Closed-form formulas for the spatial
resolution of CMs are shown to be inversely proportional to the product of a
chromatic dispersion coefficient and the square of signal bandwidth. With
MMSEs, such a convolution effect is canceled out and the estimated power
profiles approach a true power profile under a fine spatial step size.

In the last few decades, many modifications based on U-Net model have been
proposed in the literature. However, there are relatively few improvements for
the advanced UNet++ model. In our paper, we propose an encoding feature
supervised UNet++(ES-UNet++) and apply it to the liver and tumor segmentation.
ES-UNet++ consists of an encoding UNet++ and a segmentation UNet++. The
well-trained encoding UNet++ can extract the encoding features of label map
which are used to additionally supervise the segmentation UNet++. By adding
supervision to the each encoder of segmentation UNet++, U-Nets of different
depths that constitute UNet++ outperform the original version by average 5.7%
in dice score and the overall dice score is thus improved by 2.1%. ES-UNet++ is
evaluated with dataset LiTS, achieving 95.6% for liver segmentation and 67.4%

valuable properties of ES-UNet++ by conducting comparative anaylsis between
ES-UNet++ and UNet++:(1) encoding feature supervision can accelerate the
convergence of the model.(2) encoding feature supervision enhances the effect
of model pruning by achieving huge speedup while providing pruned models with

  Boltzmann collision operator","44 pages, 27 figures, 11 tables",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper addresses a neural network-based surrogate model that provides a
structure-preserving approximation for the fivefold collision integral. The
notion originates from the similarity in structure between the BGK-type
relaxation model and residual neural network (ResNet) when a particle
distribution function is treated as the input to the neural network function.
We extend the ResNet architecture and construct what we call the relaxation
neural network (RelaxNet). Specifically, two feed-forward neural networks with
physics-informed connections and activations are introduced as building blocks
in RelaxNet, which provide bounded and physically realizable approximations of
the equilibrium distribution and velocity-dependent relaxation time
respectively. The evaluation of the collision term is significantly accelerated
since the convolution in the fivefold integral is replaced by tensor
multiplication in the neural network. We fuse the mechanical advection operator
and the RelaxNet-based collision operator into a unified model named the
universal Boltzmann equation (UBE). We prove that UBE preserves the key
structural properties in a many-particle system, i.e., positivity,
conservation, invariance, and H-theorem. These properties promise that RelaxNet
is superior to strategies that naively approximate the right-hand side of the
Boltzmann equation using a machine learning model. The construction of the
RelaxNet-based UBE and its solution algorithm are presented in detail. Several
numerical experiments are investigated. The capability of the current approach
for simulating non-equilibrium flow physics is validated through excellent in-
and out-of-distribution performance.

the leading platforms for quantum computing. To construct two-qubit gates in
trapped ions, experimental manipulation approaches for ion chains are becoming
increasingly prevalent. Given the restricted control technology, how
implementing high-fidelity quantum gate operations is crucial. Many works in
current pulse design optimization focus on ion-phonon and effective ion-ion
coupling while ignoring the higher-order expansion impacts of these two terms
brought on by experiment defects. This paper proposed a novel robust quantum
control optimization method in trapped ions. By introducing the higher-order
terms caused by the error into the optimization cost function, we generated an
extremely robust Molmer-Sorensen gate with infidelity below $10^{-3}$ under
drift noise range $\pm 10$ kHz and time noise range $\pm 0.02$. Our work
reveals the vital role of higher-order coupling terms in trapped ion pulse
control optimization, especially the higher ion-ion coupling order, and
provides a robust optimization scheme for realizing more efficient entangled

of bases from genomic sequences and enable much faster and more
memory-efficient processing of the sparsified, shorter genomic sequences, while
providing similar or even higher accuracy compared to processing non-sparsified

2.57-5.38x, 1.13-2.78x, and 3.52-6.28x using real Illumina, HiFi, and ONT

work considers another mainstream syntax formalism, i.e., constituent-based
syntax. By drawing on the successful experience of SynGEC, we first propose an
extended constituent-based syntax scheme to accommodate errors in ungrammatical
sentences. Then, we automatically obtain constituency trees of ungrammatical
sentences to train a GEC-oriented constituency parser by using parallel GEC
data as a pivot. For syntax encoding, we employ the graph convolutional network
(GCN). Experimental results show that our method, named CSynGEC, yields
substantial improvements over strong baselines. Moreover, we investigate the
integration of constituent-based and dependency-based syntax for GEC in two
ways: 1) intra-model combination, which means using separate GCNs to encode
both kinds of syntax for decoding in a single model; 2)inter-model combination,
which means gathering and selecting edits predicted by different models to
achieve final corrections. We find that the former method improves recall over
using one standalone syntax formalism while the latter improves precision, and
both lead to better F0.5 values.

which helps relevant personnel respond to emergencies promptly and facilitates
the optimization of power supply strategies. However, the limited length of
short electrical record texts causes severe information sparsity, and numerous
domain-specific terminologies of power systems makes it difficult to transfer
knowledge from language models pre-trained on general-domain texts. Traditional
event detection approaches primarily focus on the general domain and ignore
these two problems in the power system domain. To address the above issues, we
propose a Multi-Channel graph neural network utilizing Type information for
Event Detection in power systems, named MC-TED, leveraging a semantic channel
and a topological channel to enrich information interaction from short texts.
Concretely, the semantic channel refines textual representations with semantic
similarity, building the semantic information interaction among potential
event-related words. The topological channel generates a relation-type-aware
graph modeling word dependencies, and a word-type-aware graph integrating
part-of-speech tags. To further reduce errors worsened by professional
terminologies in type analysis, a type learning mechanism is designed for
updating the representations of both the word type and relation type in the
topological channel. In this way, the information sparsity and professional
term occurrence problems can be alleviated by enabling interaction between
topological and semantic information. Furthermore, to address the lack of
labeled data in power systems, we built a Chinese event detection dataset based
on electrical Power Event texts, named PoE. In experiments, our model achieves
compelling results not only on the PoE dataset, but on general-domain event

knowledge graph (KG) entities. Though various methods have been developed for
KGC, most of them can only deal with the KG entities seen in the training set
and cannot perform well in predicting links concerning novel entities in the
test set. Similar problem exists in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), and no
previous temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) method is developed for
modeling newly-emerged entities. Compared to KGs, TKGs require temporal
reasoning techniques for modeling, which naturally increases the difficulty in
dealing with novel, yet unseen entities. In this work, we focus on the
inductive learning of unseen entities' representations on TKGs. We propose a
few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction task for TKGs, where we predict the
missing entities from the links concerning unseen entities by employing a
meta-learning framework and utilizing the meta-information provided by only few
edges associated with each unseen entity. We construct three new datasets for
TKG few-shot OOG link prediction, and we propose a model that mines the
concept-aware information among entities. Experimental results show that our
model achieves superior performance on all three datasets and our concept-aware
modeling component demonstrates a strong effect.

The gamma-ray emitting source WISE J141046.00+740511.2 has been
associated with a Fermi-LAT detection by crossmatching with Swift/XRT data. It
has shown all the canonical observational characteristics of a BL Lac source,
including a power-law, featureless optical spectrum. However, it was only
recently detected at radio frequencies and its radio flux is significantly low.
Aims. Given that a radio detection is fundamental to associate lower-energy
counterparts to Fermi-LAT sources, we aim to unambiguously classify this source
by performing a multiwavelength analysis based on contemporaneous data.
Methods. By using multifrequency observations at the Jansky Very Large Array,
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, Gran Telescopio Canarias, Gemini, William
Herschel Telescope and Liverpool observatories, together with Fermi-LAT and
Swift data, we carried out two kinds of analyses. On one hand, we studied
several known parameters that account for the radio loudness or weakness
characterization and their application to blazars (in general) and to our
source (in particular). And, on the other hand, we built and analyzed the
observed spectral energy distribution (SED) of this source to try to explain
its peculiar characteristics. Results. The multiwavelength analysis indicates
that WISE J141046.00+740511.2 is a blazar of the high-frequency peaked (HBL)
type that emits highly polarized light and that is likely located at a low
redshift. In addition, the one-zone model parameters that best fit its SED are
those of an extreme HBL (EHBL); this blazar type has been extensively predicted
in theory to be lacking in the radio emission that is otherwise typical of
canonical gamma-ray blazars. Conclusions. We confirm that WISE
J141046.00+740511.2 is indeed a highly polarized BL Lac of the HBL type.
Further studies will be conducted to explain the atypical low radio flux
detected for this source.

uncertainty cannot be tolerated under sampling, not even if sampling could
become infinitely frequent as the deadline is approached, unless the sampling
strategy were designed according to the growth of the control action.
Robustness under model uncertainty is analyzed and the amount of uncertainty
that can be tolerated under sampling is quantified in order to formulate the
least restrictive prescribed-time control problem that is practically
implementable. Some solutions to this problem are given for a scalar system.
Moreover, either under a-priori knowledge of bounds for initial conditions, or
if the strategy can be selected after the first measurement becomes available,
it is shown that the real, practically achievable objectives can also be

interlayer magnetism, we discover a spin-shear coupling mechanism in which a
subtle shear of the atomic layers can have a profound effect on the intralayer

diffraction and optical linear dichroism measurements, interlayer shear is
identified as the primary structural degree of freedom that couples with
magnetic order. The recovery times of both shear and magnetic order upon
optical excitation diverge at the magnetic ordering temperature with the same
critical exponent. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory shows that this
concurrent critical slowing down arises from a linear coupling of the
interlayer shear to the magnetic order, which is dictated by the broken mirror
symmetry intrinsic to the monoclinic stacking. Our results highlight the
importance of interlayer shear in ultrafast control of magnetic order via

from those of other speakers. The structure of the framework has not been
changed in the proposed method but only the training process, thus no more cost
is needed during test. Voice conversion has been chosen as the application in
this paper. Latent variable evaluations include speakerincrease verification
and identification for the sequential latent variable, and speech recognition
for the segmental latent variable. Furthermore, assessments of voice conversion
performance are on the grounds of speaker verification and speech recognition
experiments. Experiment results show that the proposed method improves both
sequential and segmental feature extraction compared with \acrshort{fhvae}, and
moderately improved voice conversion performance.

Given a
dataset with $n$ independent observations from an unknown distribution $P$, a

Sampling abstracts the goal of generating small amounts of realistic-looking
data. We provide tight upper and lower bounds for the dataset size needed for
this task for three natural families of distributions: arbitrary distributions
on $\{1,\ldots ,k\}$, arbitrary product distributions on $\{0,1\}^d$, and
product distributions on $\{0,1\}^d$ with bias in each coordinate bounded away
from 0 and 1. We demonstrate that, in some parameter regimes, private sampling
requires asymptotically fewer observations than learning a description of $P$
nonprivately; in other regimes, however, private sampling proves to be as
difficult as private learning. Notably, for some classes of distributions, the
overhead in the number of observations needed for private learning compared to
non-private learning is completely captured by the number of observations

field F: symplectic, (special) orthogonal, general (s)pin and unitary. These
groups need not be quasi-split over F. The main goal of the paper is to obtain
a local Langlands correspondence for any group G of this kind, via Hecke
algebras.
  To each Bernstein block Rep(G)^s in the category of smooth complex
G-representations, an (extended) affine Hecke algebra H(s) can be associated
with the method of Heiermann. On the other hand, to each Bernstein component
$\Phi_e (G)^{s^\vee}$ of the space \Phi_e (G) of enhanced L-parameters for G,
one can also associate an (extended) affine Hecke algebra, say $H (s^\vee)$.
For the supercuspidal representations underlying Rep(G)^s, a local Langlands
correspondence is available via endoscopy, due to Moeglin and Arthur. Using
that we assign to each Rep(G)^s a unique $\Phi_e (G)^{s^\vee}$.
  Our main new result is an algebra isomorphism $H(s)^{op} \to H (s^\vee)$,
canonical up to inner automorphisms. In combination with earlier work, that
provides an injective local Langlands correspondence Irr(G) -> \Phi_e (G) which
satisfies Borel's desiderata. This parametrization map is probably surjective
as well, but we could not show that in all cases.
  Our framework is suitable to (re)prove many results about smooth
G-representations (not necessarily reducible), and to relate them to the
geometry of a space of L-parameters. In particular our Langlands
parametrization yields an independent way to classify discrete series
G-representations in terms of Jordan blocks and supercuspidal representations
of Levi subgroups. We show that it coincides with the classification of the
discrete series obtained twenty years ago by Moeglin and Tadi\'c.

provide the first theoretical framework for robust M-estimation for TARMA

that the robust estimator for the threshold parameter is super-consistent,

strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. The Monte Carlo study shows that
the M-estimator is superior, in terms of both bias and variance, to the least

suggest that robust M-estimation should be generally preferred to the least

superior forecasting accuracy compared to the least squares fit. The results
support the hypothesis of a two-regime, asymmetric nonlinearity around zero,

little is known about how to integrate feedback from humans and analytics to

solution to overcome the blockage issue in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.
Energy efficiency is an important performance metric in mmWave systems with a
large number of antennas. However, due to the severe path loss in mmWave
systems, resource allocation algorithms tend to allocate most of the resources
for the benefit of the users with higher channel gains. In this paper, we
propose a lexicographic-based approach to find the optimal power allocation,
RIS phase shift matrix, and analog precoders that maximize both energy
efficiency and user fairness. We solve the corresponding multi-objective
optimization problem in two stages. In the first stage, we maximize the energy
efficiency, and in the second stage we maximize the fairness subject to a
minimum energy efficiency constraint. We propose an alternating optimization
procedure to solve the optimization problem in each stage. The optimal power
allocation is found using Dinkelbach's method in the first stage and using
convex optimization techniques in the second stage, the RIS phase shift matrix
is found using a gradient ascent algorithm, and the analog precoder is
determined using beam alignment. Numerical results show that the proposed
algorithm can achieve an excellent trade-off between the energy efficiency and
fairness by boosting the minimum weighted rate with a minor and controllable
reduction in the energy efficiency.

$f_\mathrm{RF}$, the primary radial magnon modes of a cylindrical magnetic
vortex can decay into secondary azimuthal modes via spontaneous three-magnon
splitting. This nonlinear process exhibits selection rules leading to
well-defined and distinct frequencies $f_\mathrm{RF}/2\pm \Delta f$ of the
secondary modes. Here, we demonstrate that three-magnon splitting in vortices
can be significantly modified by deforming the magnetic vortex with in-plane
magnetic fields, leading to a much richer three-magnon response. We find that,
with increasing field, an additional class of secondary modes is excited which
are localized to the highly-flexed regions adjacent to the displaced vortex
core. While these modes satisfy the same selection rules of three-magnon
splitting, they exhibit a much lower three-magnon threshold power compared to
regular secondary modes of a centered vortex. The applied static magnetic
fields are small ($\simeq$ 10 mT), providing an effective parameter to control
the nonlinear spectral response of confined vortices. Our work expands the
understanding of nonlinear magnon dynamics in vortices and advertises these for

  We present Perona, a novel approach to robust infrastructure fingerprinting

configurations of benchmarking tools for target resources, so that resulting
benchmark metrics are directly comparable and ranking is enabled. Insignificant
benchmark metrics are discarded by learning a low-dimensional representation of
the input metric vector, and previous benchmark executions are taken into
consideration for context-awareness as well, allowing to detect resource
degradation. We evaluate our approach both on data gathered from our own

CL is vulnerable to data poisoning based backdoor attacks (DPBAs), in which an

is backdoored. However, existing DPBAs achieve limited effectiveness. In this
work, we propose new DPBAs called CorruptEncoder to CL. CorruptEncoder uses a
theory-guided method to create optimal poisoned inputs to maximize attack
effectiveness. Our experiments show that CorruptEncoder substantially
outperforms existing DPBAs. In particular, CorruptEncoder is the first DPBA
that achieves more than 90% attack success rates with only a few (3) reference
images and a small poisoning ratio (0.5%). Moreover, we also propose a defense,
called localized cropping, to defend against DPBAs. Our results show that our
defense can reduce the effectiveness of DPBAs, though it slightly sacrifices

ignore the numbers in the fact description for predicting the term of penalty.
To tackle these issues, in this work, first, we propose a moco-based supervised
contrastive learning to learn distinguishable representations, and explore the
best strategy to construct positive example pairs to benefit all three subtasks
of LJP simultaneously. Second, in order to exploit the numbers in legal cases

Instead, we construct a distance function $d$ which is locally contracting and

which is exploited as the task weight for each proposal to guide the learning
of each stage detector. The spirit behind is to assign higher weights for
high-quality proposals with relatively complete point distribution, while
down-weight the proposals with extremely sparse points that often incur noise
during training. This design of completeness-aware re-weighting elegantly
upgrades the cascade paradigm to be better applicable for the sparse input

sample in source domain contributes to the network's prediction on the samples
from target domain. To address this, we devise a novel Interpretable Deep
Classifier (IDC) that learns the nearest source samples of a target sample as
evidence upon which the classifier makes the decision. Technically, IDC
maintains a differentiable memory bank for each category and the memory slot
derives a form of key-value pair. The key records the features of
discriminative source samples and the value stores the corresponding
properties, e.g., representative scores of the features for describing the
category. IDC computes the loss between the output of IDC and the labels of
source samples to back-propagate to adjust the representative scores and update
the memory banks. Extensive experiments on Office-Home and VisDA-2017 datasets
demonstrate that our IDC leads to a more explainable model with almost no
accuracy degradation and effectively calibrates classification for optimum
reject options. More remarkably, when taking IDC as a prior interpreter,
capitalizing on 0.1% source training data selected by IDC still yields superior
results than that uses full training set on VisDA-2017 for unsupervised domain

kernel or its factorized version comprised of 2D spatial kernel and 1D temporal

and static weights of a kernel along the temporal dimension. The pre-determined
kernel size severely limits the temporal receptive fields and the fixed weights
treat each spatial location across frames equally, resulting in sub-optimal
solution for long-range temporal modeling in natural scenes. In this paper, we
present a new recipe of temporal feature learning, namely Dynamic Temporal
Filter (DTF), that novelly performs spatial-aware temporal modeling in
frequency domain with large temporal receptive field. Specifically, DTF
dynamically learns a specialized frequency filter for every spatial location to
model its long-range temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, the temporal feature of each
spatial location is also transformed into frequency feature spectrum via 1D
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The spectrum is modulated by the learnt frequency
filter, and then transformed back to temporal domain with inverse FFT. In
addition, to facilitate the learning of frequency filter in DTF, we perform
frame-wise aggregation to enhance the primary temporal feature with its
temporal neighbors by inter-frame correlation. It is feasible to plug DTF block
into ConvNets and Transformer, yielding DTF-Net and DTF-Transformer. Extensive

comes the rise of Neural-enhanced Video Streaming (NVS), which shows great
prospects for recovering low-quality videos by mostly deploying neural
super-resolution (SR) on the media server. Despite its benefit, we reveal that
current mainstream works with SR enhancement have not achieved the desired
rate-distortion trade-off between bitrate saving and quality restoration, due
to: (1) overemphasizing the enhancement on the decoder side while omitting the
co-design of encoder, (2) limited generative capacity to recover high-fidelity
perceptual details, and (3) optimizing the compression-and-restoration pipeline
from the resolution perspective solely, without considering color bit-depth.
Aiming at overcoming these limitations, we are the first to conduct an

visual-generative property of diffusion models. Specifically, we present the
Codec-aware Diffusion Modeling (CaDM), a novel NVS paradigm to significantly
reduce streaming delivery bitrates while holding pretty higher restoration
capacity over existing methods. First, CaDM improves the encoder's compression
efficiency by simultaneously reducing resolution and color bit-depth of video
frames. Second, CaDM empowers the decoder with high-quality enhancement by
making the denoising diffusion restoration aware of encoder's resolution-color
conditions. Evaluation on public cloud services with OpenMMLab benchmarks shows
that CaDM effectively saves up to 5.12 - 21.44 times bitrates based on common

particular, a label attention mechanism is effective for multi-label

extract important global and local feature representations. Our classifier

not trivial, since there are many ways to express the same idea. For this
reason, several complementary metrics, such as BLEU, CIDEr, SPICE and SPIDEr,
are used to compare a single automatic caption to one or several captions of
reference, produced by a human annotator. Nevertheless, an automatic system can
produce several caption candidates, either using some randomness in the
sentence generation process, or by considering the various competing
hypothesized captions during decoding with beam-search, for instance. If we
consider an end-user of an AAC system, presenting several captions instead of a
single one seems relevant to provide some diversity, similarly to information
retrieval systems. In this work, we explore the possibility to consider several
predicted captions in the evaluation process instead of one. For this purpose,
we propose SPIDEr-max, a metric that takes the maximum SPIDEr value among the
scores of several caption candidates. To advocate for our metric, we report
experiments on Clotho v2.1 and AudioCaps, with a transformed-based system. On

part of ongoing investigations into how public policy and social inequalities
influence the number of and severity of COVID-19 cases. But COVID-19 incidence
can vary multifold from one subpopulation to another, including between
neighborhoods of the same city, making comparisons of case rates deceptive. At
the same time, although epidemiological heterogeneities are increasingly
well-represented in mathematical models of disease spread, fitting these models
to real data on case numbers presents a tremendous challenge, as does
interpreting the models to answer questions such as: Which public health
policies achieve the best outcomes? Which social sacrifices are most worth
making? Here we compare COVID-19 case-curves between different US states, by
clustering case surges between March 2020 and March 2021 into groups with
similar dynamics. We advance the hypothesis that each surge is driven by a
subpopulation of COVID-19 contacting individuals, and make detecting the size
of that population a step within our clustering algorithm. Clustering reveals
that case trajectories in each state conform to one of a small number (4-6) of
archetypal dynamics. Our results suggest that while the spread of COVID-19 in
different states is heterogeneous, there are underlying universalities in the
spread of the disease that may yet be predictable by models with reduced
mathematical complexity. These universalities also prove to be surprisingly
robust to school closures, which we choose as a common, but high social cost,
public health measure.

due to its ability to capture insight correlations among large-scale data.
Current CL models are biased to learn only the ability to discriminate positive
and negative pairs due to the discriminative task setting. However, this bias
would lead to ignoring its sufficiency for other downstream tasks, which we
call the discriminative information overfitting problem. In this paper, we
propose to tackle the above problems from the aspect of the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, further pushing forward the frontier of CL.
Specifically, we present a new perspective that CL is an instantiation of the
IB principle, including information compression and expression. We
theoretically analyze the optimal information situation and demonstrate that
minimum sufficient augmentation and information-generalized representation are
the optimal requirements for achieving maximum compression and generalizability
to downstream tasks. Therefore, we propose the Masked Reconstruction
Contrastive Learning~(MRCL) model to improve CL models. For implementation in
practice, MRCL utilizes the masking operation for stronger augmentation,
further eliminating redundant and noisy information. In order to alleviate the
discriminative information overfitting problem effectively, we employ the
reconstruction task to regularize the discriminative task. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and show the superiority of the proposed model on
multiple tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation and
objective detection.

which the definition of causality is unclear since the notion of interventions
on the respective variables is obscure. Asking 'what qualifies an action for
being an intervention on the variable X' raises the question whether the action
impacted all other variables only through X or directly, which implicitly
refers to a causal model.
  To avoid this known circularity, we instead suggest a notion of
'phenomenological causality' whose basic concept is a set of elementary
actions. Then the causal structure is defined such that elementary actions
change only the causal mechanism at one node (e.g. one of the causal
conditionals in the Markov factorization). This way, the Principle of
Independent Mechanisms becomes the defining property of causal structure in
domains where causality is a more abstract phenomenon rather than being an
objective fact relying on hard-wired causal links between tangible objects. We
describe this phenomenological approach to causality for toy and hypothetical
real-world examples and argue that it is consistent with the causal Markov
condition when the system under consideration interacts with other variables
that control the elementary actions.

cycles are stable over a wide interval of the coupling strengths where they
expel the dominant hyperchaotic regime existing in three Repressilators in very
large areas of parameters. The bifurcations of the inhomogeneous limit cycle,

Hyperchaos dominates in the parameter plane around the ""island"" with

learning (DL) architectures consisting of tens or even hundreds of
convolutional and fully connected hidden layers, which is far from the reality
of the human brain. According to the DL rationale, the first convolutional
layer reveals localized patterns in the input and large-scale patterns in the
following layers, until it reliably characterizes a class of inputs. Here, we
demonstrate that with a fixed ratio between the depths of the first and second
convolutional layers, the error rates of the generalized shallow LeNet
architecture, consisting of only five layers, decay as a power law with the
number of filters in the first convolutional layer. The extrapolation of this
power law indicates that the generalized LeNet can achieve small error rates
that were previously obtained for the CIFAR-10 database using DL architectures.
A power law with a similar exponent also characterizes the generalized VGG-16
architecture. However, this results in a significantly increased number of
operations required to achieve a given error rate with respect to LeNet. This
power law phenomenon governs various generalized LeNet and VGG-16
architectures, hinting at its universal behavior and suggesting a quantitative
hierarchical time-space complexity among machine learning architectures.
Additionally, the conservation law along the convolutional layers, which is the
square-root of their size times their depth, is found to asymptotically
minimize error rates. The efficient shallow learning that is demonstrated in
this study calls for further quantitative examination using various databases
and architectures and its accelerated implementation using future dedicated
hardware developments.

determine the time evolution of the scale-factor $a(t)$. It is shown that such
a universe repeatedly goes through alternate periods of matter and dark energy
domination. The resulting dynamics oscillates about the would-be ideal
time-linear or coasting path, with monotonic expansion. When compared to
dynamics of the observed physical Universe, the model recovers the
observationally-established evolutionary features of the latter, from the big
bang to the current acceleration, and farther. It suggests a universe that
initially emerges from a non-singular state, associated with a non-inflationary
acceleration, and which acceleration it exits naturally with matter-energy
generation. The model does not have a horizon problem or a flatness problem. It
reproduces the observed current values of standard cosmic parameters, including
the age $t_{0}$, the current Hubble parameter $H_{0}$ and dark energy
$\Omega_{de}\ $and matter $\Omega_{m}$ density parameters. We find the dark
matter density-profile generated by the model naturally leads to flat rotation
curves in galaxy halos. The model is falsifiable. It makes predictions that can
be tested, as suggested. Finally, we discuss the dimensionless age

health and economy, making it crucial to build accurate and interpretable
data-driven predictive models for COVID-19 cases to improve policy making. The
extremely large scale of the pandemic and the intrinsically changing
transmission characteristics pose great challenges for effective COVID-19 case
prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid model in which
the interpretability of the Autoregressive model (AR) and the predictive power
of the long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) join forces. The proposed
hybrid model is formalized as a neural network with an architecture that
connects two composing model blocks, of which the relative contribution is
decided data-adaptively in the training procedure. We demonstrate the favorable
performance of the hybrid model over its two component models as well as other
popular predictive models through comprehensive numerical studies on two data

of 8 California counties, our hybrid model achieves 4.173% MAPE on average,
outperforming the composing AR (5.629%) and LSTM (4.934%). In country-level

to overcome the challenges regarding university course allocation problem. A
hybrid evolutionary algorithm has been defined combining Local Repair Algorithm
and Modified Genetic Algorithm to generate the best course assignment. After
analyzing the collected dataset, all the necessary constraints were formulated.
These constraints manage to cover the aspects needed to be kept in mind while
preparing clash free and efficient class schedules for every faculty member.
The goal is to generate an optimized solution which will fulfill those
constraints while maintaining time efficiency and also reduce the workload of
handling this task manually. The proposed algorithm was compared with some base
level optimization algorithms to show the better efficiency in terms of
accuracy and time.

outer layer. We propose here a simple one-dimensional model to predict such
phenomenon. We idealize the problem as two axially loaded rods coupled by a
linear interfacial condition. The latter can be regarded as an adhesive that
resists slip between the two materials. One rod is modeled as a brittle
material, and the other a linearly elastic material, both undergoing finite

leverage Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)--an architecture inspired by biological

enjoy low-power computation with binary spikes. We conduct extensive
experiments on three HAR datasets with SNNs, demonstrating that SNNs are on par
with ANNs in terms of accuracy while reducing up to 94% energy consumption. The

has been a long-standing dream of researchers since the early days of
artificial intelligence. The well-known Turing Test proposed to judge the
ultimate validity of an artificial intelligence agent on the
indistinguishability of its dialogues from humans'. It should come as no
surprise that human-level dialogue systems are very challenging to build. But,
while early effort on rule-based systems found limited success, the emergence
of deep learning enabled great advance on this topic.
  In this thesis, we focus on methods that address the numerous issues that
have been imposing the gap between artificial conversational agents and
human-level interlocutors. These methods were proposed and experimented with in
ways that were inspired by general state-of-the-art AI methodologies. But they
also targeted the characteristics that dialogue systems possess.

human queries can improve the accuracy of existing systems and propose
improving the future design of QA models.

  fracture in composite structure with randomly distributed particles",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The fracture simulation of random particle reinforced composite structures
remains a challenge. Current techniques either assumed a homogeneous model,
ignoring the microstructure characteristics of composite structures, or
considered a micro-mechanical model, involving intractable computational costs.
This paper proposes a peridynamics-based statistical multiscale (PSM) framework
to simulate the macroscopic structure fracture with high efficiency. The
heterogeneities of composites, including the shape, spatial distribution and
volume fraction of particles, are characterized within the representative
volume elements (RVEs), and their impact on structure failure are extracted as
two types of peridynamic parameters, namely, statistical critical stretch and
equivalent micromodulus. At the microscale level, a bond-based peridynamic
(BPD) model with energy-based micromodulus correction technique is introduced
to simulate the fracture in RVEs, and then the computational model of
statistical critical stretch is established through micromechanical analysis.
Moreover, based on the statistical homogenization approach, the computational
model of effective elastic tensor is also established. Then, the equivalent
micromodulus can be derived from the effective elastic tensor, according to the
energy density equivalence between classical continuum mechanics (CCM) and BPD
models. At the macroscale level, a macroscale BPD model with the statistical
critical stretch and the equivalent micromodulus is constructed to simulate the
fracture in the macroscopic homogenized structures. The algorithm framework of
the PSM method is also described. Two- and three-dimensional numerical examples
illustrate the validity, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.
