cavitating flows in large-scale computational fluid dynamics systems. These
models use the computationally efficient volume-of-fluids method for multiphase
problems. Cavitation phenomena act on magnitudes smaller spacial and temporal
scales than the macroscopic bulk flow. The central challenge for homogeneous
cavitation models lies therefore in modelling cavitation phenomena on a
sub-scale. This review article analyses how the sub-scale modelling of phase
transitions and bubble dynamics is realized. In particular, it is emphasized
how the underlying model assumptions define the respective cavitation models.
Twelve particular approaches to homogeneous cavitating flow modelling have been
identified. Their methodology is presented in detail and derived models are
highlighted. This article promotes understanding of these models and, in
particular, it gives rise to limits of the homogeneous cavitation approach on
the basis of the fundamental assumptions. Therewith, this review poses a
unified theoretical basis for these models, and leads up to a subsequent study
on accuracy and performances of these.

environmental disorder by randomly modulating the molecular transition
frequencies and the coupling between the emitters and the electromagnetic

orientational disorder. We investigate how these effects lead to new features
in the steady state absorption (outside the cavity), transmission spectra
(inside the cavity) and the yield of local molecular processes such as a
unimolecular reaction. Outside the cavity, the collective behavior is
manifested in the linewidth of the steady state absorption, the emission
spectrum, and the local chemical yield. Inside the cavity, however, the
collective behavior primarily determines the Rabi splitting. Effects of
intermolecular interactions under orientational disorder are also studied. For
the most part, for all types of disorder, if we increase disorder, we find a
reduction in the collective nature of the molecular response (smaller effective
N), and therefore, the Rabi splitting contraction occurs with orientational
disorder. Moreover, we find that static disorder is more destructive to
collective behavior than dynamic disorder.

an infinitely large foundation model with a perfect training algorithm and
guaranteed zero generalization error on the pretext task, can the model be used
for everything? This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of
representation, optimization or generalization, because the issues they mainly
investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that
category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have
proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning,
saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if
the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this
limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry)
can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext
task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a
new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can
generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the
structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way,
we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning,
which might be of independent interest.

assertions are underapproximating, since the set of all valid promises are not

i) a robust multi-category (non-)localizability detection module, and ii) a
localizability-aware constrained ICP optimization module and couples both in a
unified manner. The proposed localizability detection is achieved by utilizing
the correspondences between the scan and the map to analyze the alignment
strength against the principal directions of the optimization as part of its
multi-category LiDAR localizability analysis. In the second part, this
localizability analysis is then tightly integrated into the scan-to-map point
cloud registration to generate drift-free pose updates along well-constrained
directions. The proposed method is thoroughly evaluated and compared to
state-of-the-art methods in simulation and during real-world experiments,
underlying the gain in performance and reliability in LiDAR-challenging

(three Boson-Fermion states, three Fermion-Boson states). More interestingly,
expanding the Hilbert space by introducing an extra DoF for two photons enables
to transfer the unmeasurable external phase in the initial DoF to a measurable
internal phase in the expanded two DoFs. We directly measured the symmetric
exchange phases being $0.012 \pm 0.002$, $0.025 \pm 0.002$ and $0.027 \pm

predict dense displacement fields in the full-resolution spatial domain. For
high-resolution volumetric image data, this process is however resource
intensive and time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose the
Fourier-Net, replacing the expansive path in a U-Net style network with a
parameter-free model-driven decoder. Specifically, instead of our Fourier-Net
learning to output a full-resolution displacement field in the spatial domain,
we learn its low-dimensional representation in a band-limited Fourier domain.
This representation is then decoded by our devised model-driven decoder
(consisting of a zero padding layer and an inverse discrete Fourier transform
layer) to the dense, full-resolution displacement field in the spatial domain.
These changes allow our unsupervised Fourier-Net to contain fewer parameters
and computational operations, resulting in faster inference speeds. Fourier-Net
is then evaluated on two public 3D brain datasets against various
state-of-the-art approaches. For example, when compared to a recent
transformer-based method, i.e., TransMorph, our Fourier-Net, only using
0.22$\%$ of its parameters and 6.66$\%$ of the mult-adds, achieves a 0.6\%
higher Dice score and an 11.48$\times$ faster inference speed. Code is

physics at exaggerated scales. In the so-called trilobite and butterfly Rydberg
molecules, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation can fail due to strong
non-adiabatic couplings arising from the combination of radial oscillations and
rapid energy variations in the adiabatic potential energy curves. We utilize an
accurate coupled-channel treatment of the vibronic system to observe the
breakdown of Born-Oppenheimer physics, such as non-adiabatic trapping and decay
of molecular states found near pronounced avoided crossings in the adiabatic
potential curves. Even for vibrational states localized far away from avoided
crossings, a single channel model is quantitatively sufficient only after
including the diagonal non-adiabatic corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer
potentials. Our results indicate the importance of including non-adiabatic
physics in the description of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules and in the
interpretation of measured vibronic spectra.

states, due to simplicity of their bulk Hamiltonians. The main challenge on
this path is a systematic description of the boundary, which comes down to
determining proper boundary conditions (BCs). BCs are a consequence of the
fundamental principle of quantum mechanics: norm conservation of the wave
function, which leads to the conservation of the probability current at the
boundary. The notion of {\em general BCs} arises, as a family of all possible
BCs that satisfy the current-conservation principle. Ahari, Ortiz, and Seradjeh
formulated a systematic derivation procedure of the general BCs from the
current-conservation principle for the 1D Hamiltonian of the most general form.
The procedure is based on the diagonalization of the current and leads to the
universal ``standardized'' form of the general BCs, parameterized in a
nonredundant one-to-one way by unitary matrices. In this work, we substantiate,
elucidate, and expand this {\em formalism of general boundary conditions for
continuum models}, addressing in detail a number of important physical and
mathematical points. We provide a detailed derivation of the general BCs from
the current-conservation principle and establish the conditions for when they
are admissible in the sense that they describe a well-defined boundary, which
is directly related to a subtle but crucial distinction between self-adjoint
(hermitian) and only symmetric operators. We provide a natural physical
interpretation of the structure of the general BCs as a scattering process and
an essential mathematical justification that the formalism is well-defined for
Hamiltonians of momentum order higher than linear. We discuss the physical
meaning of the general BCs and outline the application schemes of the
formalism, in particular, for the study of bound states in topological systems.

track the three-dimensional (3D) morphodynamics and cell orientational order of
growing bacterial biofilms encased by agarose gels. Confined growth causes
spatiotemporally heterogeneous stress buildup in the biofilm. High hydrostatic

largely on its distribution. In contrast, wetting has a very small impact on
the charge-enthalpy coupling. We rationalize the results with simple analytical

awareness. Gathering situational awareness using social media has been
functional to manage epidemics. Previous research focused on using discussions
during periods of epidemic crises on social media platforms like Twitter,
Reddit, or Facebook and developing NLP techniques to filter out relevant
discussions from a huge corpus of messages and posts. Social media usage varies
with internet penetration and other socioeconomic factors, which might induce
disparity in analyzing discussions across different geographies. However, print
media is a ubiquitous information source, irrespective of geography. Further,
topics discussed in news articles are already newsworthy, while on social media
newsworthiness is a product of techno-social processes. Developing this
fundamental difference, we study Twitter data during the second wave in India
focused on six high-population cities with varied macroeconomic factors.
Through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, we further analyze
two Indian newspapers during the same period and compare topics from both
Twitter and the newspapers to evaluate situational awareness around the second
phase of COVID on each of these platforms. We conclude that factors like
internet penetration and GDP in a specific city influence the discourse
surrounding situational updates on social media. Thus, augmenting information
from newspapers with information extracted from social media would provide a
more comprehensive perspective in resource deficit cities.

on connecting many more new users and devices, at the same time being energy
efficient and minimizing its carbon footprint. However, the current approaches
to address the growing number of users and spectrum demands, like traditional
fully digital architectures for Massive MIMO, demand exorbitant energy
consumption. The reason is that traditionally MIMO requires a separate RF chain
per antenna, so the power consumption scales with number of antennas, instead
of number of users, hence becomes energy inefficient. Instead, GreenMO creates
a new massive MIMO architecture which is able to use many more antennas while
keeping power consumption to user-proportionate numbers. To achieve this
GreenMO introduces for the first time, the concept of virtualization of the RF
chain hardware. Instead of laying the RF chains physically to each antenna,
GreenMO creates these RF chains virtually in digital domain. This also enables
GreenMO to be the first flexible massive MIMO architecture. Since GreenMO's
virtual RF chains are created on the fly digitally, it can tune the number of
these virtual chains according to the user load, hence always flexibly consume
user-proportionate power. Thus, GreenMO paves the way for green and flexible
massive MIMO. We prototype GreenMO on a PCB with eight antennas and evaluate it
with a WARPv3 SDR platform in an office environment. The results demonstrate
that GreenMO is 3x more power-efficient than traditional Massive MIMO and 4x
more spectrum-efficient than traditional OFDMA systems, while multiplexing 4
users, and can save upto 40% power in modern 5G NR base stations.

synthesizing high resolution photorealistic images with view consistency and
detailed 3D shapes, but training them for diverse domains is challenging since
it requires massive training images and their camera distribution information.
Text-guided domain adaptation methods have shown impressive performance on
converting the 2D generative model on one domain into the models on other
domains with different styles by leveraging the CLIP (Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training), rather than collecting massive datasets for those
domains. However, one drawback of them is that the sample diversity in the
original generative model is not well-preserved in the domain-adapted
generative models due to the deterministic nature of the CLIP text encoder.
Text-guided domain adaptation will be even more challenging for 3D generative
models not only because of catastrophic diversity loss, but also because of
inferior text-image correspondence and poor image quality. Here we propose
DATID-3D, a domain adaptation method tailored for 3D generative models using
text-to-image diffusion models that can synthesize diverse images per text
prompt without collecting additional images and camera information for the
target domain. Unlike 3D extensions of prior text-guided domain adaptation
methods, our novel pipeline was able to fine-tune the state-of-the-art 3D
generator of the source domain to synthesize high resolution, multi-view
consistent images in text-guided targeted domains without additional data,
outperforming the existing text-guided domain adaptation methods in diversity

3D image manipulations such as one-shot instance-selected adaptation and
single-view manipulated 3D reconstruction to fully enjoy diversity in text.

it probes matter with high spatial and elemental sensitivity. However, the
theoretical modelling of XAS is a challenging task since XAS spectra feature a
fine structure due to scalar (SC) and spin-orbit (SO) relativistic effects, in
particular near L and M absorption edges. While full four-component (4c)
calculations of XAS are nowadays feasible, there is still interest in
developing approximate relativistic methods that enable XAS calculations at the
two-component (2c) level while maintaining the accuracy of the parent 4c
approach. In this article we present theoretical and numerical insights into
two simple yet accurate 2c approaches based on an (extended) atomic mean-field
exact two-component Hamiltonian framework, (e)amfX2C, for the calculation of
XAS using linear eigenvalue and damped-response time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT). In contrast to the commonly used one-electron X2C
(1eX2C) Hamiltonian, both amfX2C and eamfX2C account for the SC and SO
two-electron and exchange-correlation picture-change (PC) effects that arise
from the X2C transformation. As we demonstrate on L- and M-edge XAS spectra of
transition metal and actinide compounds, the absence of PC corrections in the
1eX2C approximation results in a substantial overestimatation of SO splittings,
whereas (e)amfX2C Hamiltonians reproduce all essential spectral features such
as shape, position, and SO splitting of the 4c references in excellent
agreement, while offering significant computational savings. Therefore, the
(e)amfX2C PC correction models presented here constitute reliable relativistic
2c quantum-chemical approaches for modelling XAS.

sampling (elfs). The elfs process repeatedly samples from an electric flow on a
graph. While the sinks of the flow are fixed, the source is updated using the
electric flow sample, and the process ends when it hits a sink vertex.
  We argue that this process naturally connects to many key quantities of
interest. E.g., we describe a random walk coupling which implies that the elfs
process has the same arrival distribution as a random walk. We also analyze the
electric hitting time, which is the expected time before the process hits a
sink vertex. As our main technical contribution, we show that the electric
hitting time on trees is logarithmic in the graph size and weights.
  The initial motivation behind the elfs process is that quantum walks can
sample from electric flows, and they can hence implement this process very
naturally. This yields a quantum walk algorithm for sampling from the random
walk arrival distribution, which has widespread applications. It complements
the existing line of quantum walk search algorithms which only return an
element from the sink, but yield no insight in the distribution of the returned
element. By our bound on the electric hitting time on trees, the quantum walk
algorithm on trees requires quadratically fewer steps than the random walk
hitting time, up to polylog factors.

from the stellar disk vector by more than 20 degrees beyond about 30
galactocentric kpc, reaching a maximum of 30--90 degrees depending on the
individual halo's formation history. In identical simulations using a model of

extremely challenging task. Prior work explores using reinforcement learning

increase the complexity of the design space (e.g., full stack System-on-Chip

Multi-Agent RL (MARL) to tackle this problem. The key idea behind using MARL is
an observation that parameters across different sub-systems are more or less

this hypothesis by designing domain-specific DRAM memory controller for several

models. In combination with an efficient joint tuning strategy and
post-processing, our method can achieve a compression ratio of 100$\times$ by
reducing the overall model size to 1 MB with negligible loss on visual quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of
achieving unrivaled performance and well generalization across multiple methods

attention due to their potential to broaden application areas of halide double
perovskites into e.g. spintronics. Up to date the theoretical modelling of
these systems have relied on primitive approximations to the density functional
theory (DFT). In this paper, we study structural, electronic and magnetic
properties of the Fe$^{3+}$-containing HDPs Cs$_2$AgFeCl$_6$ and
Cs$_2$NaFeCl$_6$ using a combination of more advanced DFT-based methods,
including DFT+U, hybrid-DFT and treatments of various magnetic states. We
examine the effect of varying the effective Hubbard parameter, U$_{eff}$, in
DFT+U and the mixing-parameter, $\alpha$, in hybrid DFT on the electronic
structure and structural properties. Our results reveal a set of localized
Fe(d) states that are highly sensitive to these parameters. Cs$_2$AgFeCl$_6$
and Cs$_2$NaFeCl$_6$ are both antiferromagnets with Ne\'el temperatures well
below room temperature and are thus in their paramagnetic (PM) state at the
external conditions relevant to most applications. Therefore, we have examined
the effect of disordered magnetism on the electronic structure of these systems
and find that while Cs$_2$NaFeCl$_6$ is largely unaffected, Cs$_2$AgFeCl$_6$
shows significant renormalization of its electronic band structure.

understanding of the relation between void galaxies and their environment: the
relationship between luminous and dark matter in and around voids. Aims. To
explore the extent to which local Universe voids are empty of matter, we study
the full (dark+luminous) matter content of seven nearby cosmic voids that are
fully contained within the CosmicFlows-3 volume. Methods. We obtained the
matter-density profiles of seven cosmic voids using two independent methods.
These were built from the galaxy redshift space two-point correlation function
in conjunction with peculiar velocity gradients from the CosmicFlows-3 dataset.
Results. The results are striking, because when the redshift survey is used,
all voids show a radial positive gradient of galaxies, while based on the
dynamical analysis, only three of these voids display a clear underdensity of
matter in their center. Conclusions. This work constitutes the most detailed
observational analysis of voids conducted so far, and shows that void emptiness
should be derived from dynamical information. From this limited study, the
Hercules void appears to be the best candidate for a local Universe pure
""pristine volume"", expanding in three directions with no dark matter located in
that void.

in the phase III AAML1031 clinical trial in which patients move through a
sequence of four treatment courses. At each course, they undergo treatment that
may or may not include anthracyclines (ACT). While ACT is known to be effective
at treating AML, it is also cardiotoxic and can lead to early death for some
patients. Our task is to estimate the potential survival probability under
hypothetical dynamic ACT treatment strategies, but there are several
impediments. First, since ACT was not randomized in the trial, its effect on
survival is confounded over time. Second, subjects initiate the next course
depending on when they recover from the previous course, making timing
potentially informative of subsequent treatment and survival. Third, patients
may die or drop out before ever completing the full treatment sequence. We
develop a generative Bayesian semi-parametric model based on Gamma Process
priors to address these complexities. At each treatment course, the model
captures subjects' transition to subsequent treatment or death in continuous
time under a given rule. A g-computation procedure is used to compute a
posterior over potential survival probability that is adjusted for time-varying
confounding. Using this approach, we conduct posterior inference for the
efficacy of hypothetical treatment rules that dynamically modify ACT based on
evolving cardiac function.

We restrict the analysis to the case $\gamma + 2 \lambda \geq 1 $. In this

limited by available methods to examine the relationship between multi-omic
molecular phenomena and clinical outcomes. Integrative factorization methods
for multi-omic data can reveal latent patterns of variation describing
important biological signal. However, most methods do not provide a framework
for inference on the estimated factorization, simultaneously predict important
disease phenotypes or clinical outcomes, nor accommodate multiple imputation.
To address these gaps, we propose Bayesian Simultaneous Factorization (BSF). We
use conjugate normal priors and show that the posterior mode of this model can
be estimated by solving a structured nuclear norm-penalized objective that also
achieves rank selection and motivates the choice of hyperparameters. We then
extend BSF to simultaneously predict a continuous or binary response, termed
Bayesian Simultaneous Factorization and Prediction (BSFP). BSF and BSFP
accommodate concurrent imputation and full posterior inference for missing
data, including ""blockwise"" missingness, and BSFP offers prediction of
unobserved outcomes. We show via simulation that BSFP is competitive in
recovering latent variation structure, as well as the importance of propagating
uncertainty from the estimated factorization to prediction. We also study the
imputation performance of BSF via simulation under missing-at-random and
missing-not-at-random assumptions. Lastly, we use BSFP to predict lung function
based on the bronchoalveolar lavage metabolome and proteome from a study of
HIV-associated OLD. Our analysis reveals a distinct cluster of patients with
OLD driven by shared metabolomic and proteomic expression patterns, as well as
multi-omic patterns related to lung function decline. Software is freely

interpolate between Born-Infeld at small distances and ModMax at large
distances. These models are duality invariant and feature a $K-$mouflage
screening in the Born-Infeld regime. We focus on computing the static
perturbations around a point-like screened charge in terms of two decoupled
scalar potentials describing the polar and the axial sectors respectively.
Duality invariance imposes that the propagation speed of the odd perturbations
goes to zero as fast as the effective screened charge of the object,
potentially leading to strong coupling and an obstruction to the viability of
the EFT below the screened radius. We then consider the linear response to
external fields and compute the electric polarisability and the magnetic
susceptibility. Imposing regularity of the perturbations at the position of the
particle, we find that the polarisability for the odd multipoles vanishes
whilst for the magnetisation Born-Infeld emerges as the only theory with
vanishing susceptibility for even multipoles. The perturbation equations
factorise in terms of ladder operators connecting different multipoles. There
are two such ladder structures for the even sector: one that acts as an
automorphism between the first four multipoles and another one that connects
multipoles separated by four units. When requiring a similar ladder structure
for the odd sector, Born-Infeld arises again as the unique theory. We use this
ladder structure to relate the vanishing of the polarisability and the
susceptibility to the values of conserved charges. Finally the perturbation
equations correspond to a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system such that
the polar sector can be described in terms of Schr\""odinger's equations with
four generalised hyperbolic P\""osch-Teller potentials whose eigenfunctions are
in correspondence with the multipoles.

its extension to the loop level is conjectural. Lifting the on-shell,
scattering amplitudes-based description to the level of action functionals, we
argue that a theory that exhibits tree-level colour-kinematics duality can be
reformulated in a way such that its loop integrands manifest a generalised form
of colour-kinematics duality. Moreover, we show how the structures of higher
homotopy theory naturally describe this off-shell reformulation of

This paper provides a performance-driven design exploration framework to
augment the human designer through a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
(CVAE), which serves as forward performance predictor for given design features
as well as an inverse design feature predictor conditioned on a set of
performance requests. The CVAE is trained on 18'000 synthetically generated
instances of a pedestrian bridge in Switzerland. Sensitivity analysis is
employed for explainability and informing designers about (i) relations of the

serve as a future co-pilot for conceptual design studies of pedestrian bridges

$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV. The dynamics in the beam
direction is constrained using the measured pseudo-rapidity distribution of
charged particles and the net proton rapidity distribution. Within this
framework, the directed flow of mesons is driven by the sideward pressure
gradient from the tilted source, and that of baryons mainly due to the initial
asymmetric baryon distribution with respect to the beam axis driven by the
transverse expansion. Our approach successfully reproduces the rapidity- and
beam energy-dependence of $v_1$ for both mesons and baryons. We find that the
$v_1(y)$ of baryons has strong constraining power on the initial baryon
stopping, and together with that of mesons, the directed flow probes the
equation of state of the dense nuclear matter at finite chemical potentials.

assigns it to a server with the shortest queue among $d\geq 2$ randomly

interconnection on optimal storage through distinct channels: differences in
(i) countries' solar PV and wind power capacity factors, (ii) load profiles, as

effects into the semiclassical analysis is to adopt a dressed metric from the
QG model. This procedure assumes that the expectation value of the metric
effectively captures all the QG subtleties in the semiclassical regime.
However, the geometrical factors that typically appear in the semiclassical
equations of motion are usually made out of conjugate variables of the
gravitational degrees of freedom, that do not commute in QG and therefore will
not be known entirely from the expectation value of only one variable in the
phase space. These operators suffer from the operator ordering ambiguity, and
different ordering schemes might leave their imprints in the semiclassical
analysis. We investigate the viability of the dressed metric approach in the
context of flat-FLRW model with perfect fluid. We write the Hermitian operators
corresponding to these observables with the fluid degree of freedom as the
clock. A general class of operator ordering of these observables is considered,
and their expectation values are calculated for a unitarily evolving wave
packet. In the case of dust dominated universe, the expectation value of the
Hubble parameter matches the dressed expression, i.e., the expression computed
from the scale factor expectation value. In the case of curvature invariants,
the relative difference between the dressed expression and quantum expectation
is maximum at the location of singularity and decays for late time. The case of
cosmological constant driven universe is at contrast: there is a disagreement
between the dressed expressions and quantum expectations, even at the late
time. Thus, the dressed metric approach captures the essence of the full
quantum treatment for the dust dominated case, whereas it is bound to receive
significant correction for the dark energy dominated universe.

  Learning Through Empirical Falsification Workshop at NeurIPS 2022",,,,"cs.NE cs.FL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this study, we investigate the generalization of LSTM, ReLU and GRU models
on counting tasks over long sequences. Previous theoretical work has
established that RNNs with ReLU activation and LSTMs have the capacity for
counting with suitable configuration, while GRUs have limitations that prevent
correct counting over longer sequences. Despite this and some positive
empirical results for LSTMs on Dyck-1 languages, our experimental results show
that LSTMs fail to learn correct counting behavior for sequences that are
significantly longer than in the training data. ReLUs show much larger variance
in behavior and in most cases worse generalization. The long sequence
generalization is empirically related to validation loss, but reliable long
sequence generalization seems not practically achievable through
backpropagation with current techniques. We demonstrate different failure modes
for LSTMs, GRUs and ReLUs. In particular, we observe that the saturation of
activation functions in LSTMs and the correct weight setting for ReLUs to
generalize counting behavior are not achieved in standard training regimens. In
summary, learning generalizable counting behavior is still an open problem and
we discuss potential approaches for further research.

(UGV) and/or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which can be modeled as dynamic
systems on SE(3). The onboard sensing outputs of the dynamic system can usually
be applied to derive the relative position between the feature marks and the
system, but bearing with explicit geometrical constraint. Such a visual
geometrical constraint makes the design of the visual observer on SE(3) very
challenging, as it will cause a time-varying or switching visible set due to
the varying number of feature marks in this set along different trajectories.
Moreover, the possibility of having mis-identified feature marks and modeling
uncertainties might result in a divergent estimation error. This paper proposes
a new robust observer design method that can accommodate these uncertainties
from onboard visual sensing. The key design idea for this observer is to
estimate the visible set and identify the mis-identified features from the
measurements. Based on the identified uncertainties, a switching strategy is
proposed to ensure bounded estimation error for any given trajectory over a
fixed time interval. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed robust observer.

Some AO systems are not fast enough to correct for strong, fast, high
turbulence wind layers leading to the wind butterfly effect, or wind-driven
halo, reducing contrast capabilities in coronagraphic images. Estimating the
effective wind speed of the atmosphere allows us to calculate the atmospheric
coherence time. This is not only an important parameter to understand for site
characterization but could be used to help remove the wind butterfly in post
processing. Here we present a method for estimating the atmospheric effective
wind speed from spatio-temporal covariance maps generated from pseudo open-loop
(POL) WFS data. POL WFS data is used as it aims to reconstruct the full
wavefront information when operating in closed-loop. The covariance maps show
how different atmospheric turbulent layers traverse the telescope. Our method
successfully recovered the effective wind speed from simulated WFS data
generated with the soapy python library. The simulated atmospheric turbulence
profiles consist of two turbulent layers of ranging strengths and velocities.
The method has also been applied to Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) AO WFS data.
This gives insight into how the effective wind speed can affect the wind-driven

involving difficult-to-reach regions in the human body. Planning motions safely
within constrained anatomical environments requires accuracy and efficiency in
shape estimation and collision checking. Tendon robots that employ
arbitrarily-routed tendons can achieve complex and interesting shapes, enabling
them to travel to difficult-to-reach anatomical regions. Arbitrarily-routed
tendon-driven robots have unintuitive nonlinear kinematics. Therefore, we
envision clinicians leveraging an assistive interactive-rate motion planner to
automatically generate collision-free trajectories to clinician-specified
destinations during minimally-invasive surgical procedures. Standard
motion-planning techniques cannot achieve interactive-rate motion planning with
the current expensive tendon robot kinematic models. In this work, we present a
3-phase motion-planning system for arbitrarily-routed tendon-driven robots with
a Precompute phase, a Load phase, and a Supervisory Control phase. Our system
achieves an interactive rate by developing a fast kinematic model (over 1,000
times faster than current models), a fast voxel collision method (27.6 times
faster than standard methods), and leveraging a precomputed roadmap of the
entire robot workspace with pre-voxelized vertices and edges. In simulated
experiments, we show that our motion-planning method achieves high tip-position
accuracy and generates plans at 14.8 Hz on average in a segmented collapsed
lung pleural space anatomical environment. Our results show that our method is
17,700 times faster than popular off-the-shelf motion planning algorithms with
standard FK and collision detection approaches. Our open-source code is

Asymmetric Neutral hydrogen Disk Integrated Spectrum Characterization
(PANDISC). The model shows great flexibility in reproducing the diverse Hi
profiles. We use Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) for fitting the model to
global H I profiles, producing statistically robust quantitative results.
Comparing with several samples of H I data available in the literature , we
find the model-fitted results agree with catalogued velocity widths (e.g., W50)
down to the lowest S/N. The model is also shown to be useful for applications
like the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) and profile-based sample
control. By comparing v_r to v_flat , we uncover how the H I width is affected
by the structure of the rotation curve, following a trend consistent with the
difference in the BTFR slope. We also select a sample of spectra with broad
wing-like features suggestive of a population of galaxies with unusual gas
dynamics. The PANDISC model bears both promise and limitations for potential
use beyond H I lines. Further application on the whole ALFALFA sample will
enable us to perform large scale ensemble studies of the H I properties and

of the form: \emph{Object $A$ is more similar to $B$ than to $C$.} Recently, it
has been shown that, in Hierarchical Clustering, single and complete linkage
can be directly implemented using only such comparisons while several
algorithms have been proposed to emulate the behaviour of average linkage.
Hence, finding hierarchies (or dendrograms) using only comparisons is a well
understood problem. However, evaluating their meaningfulness when no
ground-truth nor explicit similarities are available remains an open question.
  In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing a new revenue function that
allows one to measure the goodness of dendrograms using only comparisons. We
show that this function is closely related to Dasgupta's cost for hierarchical
clustering that uses pairwise similarities. On the theoretical side, we use the
proposed revenue function to resolve the open problem of whether one can
approximately recover a latent hierarchy using few triplet comparisons. On the
practical side, we present principled algorithms for comparison-based
hierarchical clustering based on the maximisation of the revenue and we
empirically compare them with existing methods.

of people globally living in coastal zones. Models representing coastal
adaptation and impacts are important tools to inform the design of strategies
to manage these risks. Representing the often deep uncertainties influencing
these risks poses nontrivial challenges. A common uncertainty characterization
approach is to use a few benchmark cases to represent the range and relative
probabilities of the set of possible outcomes. This has been done in coastal
adaptation studies, for example, by using low, moderate, and high percentiles
of an input of interest, like sea-level changes. A key consideration is how
this simplified characterization of uncertainty influences the distributions of
estimated coastal impacts. Here, we show that using only a few benchmark
percentiles to represent uncertainty in future sea-level change can lead to
overconfident projections and underestimate high-end risks as compared to using
full ensembles for sea-level change and socioeconomic parametric uncertainties.
When uncertainty in future sea level is characterized by low, moderate, and
high percentiles of global mean sea-level rise, estimates of high-end (95th
percentile) damages are underestimated by between 18% (SSP1-2.6) and 46%
(SSP5-8.5). Additionally, using the 5th and 95th percentiles of sea-level
scenarios underestimates the 5-95% width of the distribution of adaptation
costs by a factor ranging from about two to four, depending on SSP-RCP pathway.
The resulting underestimation of the uncertainty range in adaptation costs can
bias adaptation and mitigation decision-making.

cosmological simulations from the CAMELS project to estimate simulated
observables, taking as input the cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and
use these emulators as surrogates to the cosmological simulations. Using the
cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and, separately, stellar mass
functions (SMFs) at different redshifts, we perform ILI on selected
cosmological and astrophysical parameters (Omega_m, sigma_8, stellar wind
feedback, and kinetic black hole feedback) and obtain full 6-dimensional

SFRD (SMFs) can recover the target observables with a relative error of 0.17%
(0.4%). We find that degeneracies exist between the parameters inferred from
the emulated SFRD, confirmed with new full cosmological simulations. We also
find that the SMFs can break the degeneracy in the SFRD, which indicates that
the SMFs provide complementary constraints for the parameters. Further, we find
that the parameter combination inferred from an observationally-inferred SFRD
reproduces the target observed SFRD very well, whereas, in the case of the
SMFs, the inferred and observed SMFs show significant discrepancies that
indicate potential limitations of the current galaxy formation modeling and
calibration framework, and/or systematic differences and inconsistencies

appropriate interventions can be made. This paper considers settings where the
user's goal is specified as a target interval for a real-valued performance
summary, such as the cumulative reward, measured at a fixed horizon $H$. At
each time $t \in \{0, \ldots, H-1\}$, our method produces a calibrated estimate
of the probability that the final cumulative reward will fall within a
user-specified target interval $[y^-,y^+].$ Using this estimate, the autonomous
system can raise an alarm if the probability drops below a specified threshold.
We compute the probability estimates by inverting conformal prediction. Our
starting point is the Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) method of Romano
et al., which applies split-conformal prediction to the results of quantile
regression. CQR is not invertible, but by using the conditional cumulative
distribution function (CDF) as the non-conformity measure, we show how to
obtain an invertible modification that we call \textbf{P}robability-space
\textbf{C}onformalized \textbf{Q}uantile \textbf{R}egression (PCQR). Like CQR,
PCQR produces well-calibrated conditional prediction intervals with
finite-sample marginal guarantees. By inverting PCQR, we obtain marginal
guarantees for the probability that the cumulative reward of an autonomous
system will fall within an arbitrary user-specified target intervals.
Experiments on two domains confirm that these probabilities are

trustworthiness trade-off. In this work, we argue that the trustworthiness of a
classifier's prediction for a sample is highly associated with two factors: the

best of both worlds, we design a model-agnostic post-hoc approach NeighborAgg

aggregation. Theoretically, we show that NeighborAgg is a generalized version
of a one-hop graph convolutional network, inheriting the powerful modeling
ability to capture the varying similarity between samples within each class. We
also extend our approach to the closely related task of mislabel detection and
provide a theoretical coverage guarantee to bound the false negative.
Empirically, extensive experiments on image and tabular benchmarks verify our
theory and suggest that NeighborAgg outperforms other methods, achieving

identify causal effects even in the presence of unobserved confounding. While
the statistical properties of the front-door estimation are quite well
understood, its algorithmic aspects remained unexplored for a long time.
Recently, Jeong, Tian, and Barenboim [NeurIPS 2022] have presented the first
polynomial-time algorithm for finding sets satisfying the front-door criterion
in a given directed acyclic graph (DAG), with an $O(n^3(n+m))$ run time, where

for this task, which thus reaches the asymptotically optimal time complexity.
This result implies an $O(n(n+m))$ delay enumeration algorithm of all
front-door adjustment sets, again improving previous work by Jeong et al.\ by a
factor of $n^3$. Moreover, we provide the first linear-time algorithm for

(A=K, Cs, Rb) recently attracted a large interest for various exotic electronic
states. These states arise within a parent charge density wave (CDW) phase that
appears to simultaneously break both the translational and the rotational
symmetry of the lattice. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling
microscopy to study a newly synthesized kagome metal CsTi3Bi5, which is
isostructural to AV3Sb5 but with a titanium atom kagome network. In sharp
contrast to its vanadium-based counterpart, CsTi3Bi5 does not exhibit
detectable CDW states. By imaging the scattering and interference of electrons,
we obtain momentum-space information about the low-energy electronic structure
of CsTi3Bi5. A comparison to our density functional theory calculations reveals
substantial electronic correlation effects at low-energies in this material.
Remarkably, by comparing the amplitudes of scattering wave vectors along
different directions, we discover a pronounced electronic anisotropy that
breaks the six-fold symmetry of the lattice, arising from both in-plane and
out-of-plane titanium-derived d orbitals. Our experiments reveal the emergence
of a genuine electronic nematic order in CsTi3Bi5, the first among the ""135""

the polarization of information users see via their follower and retweet graphs

$\gamma=4.0^{+1.7}_{-1.5}-11^{+4}_{-3}$ depending on the assumed age of the

model to predict the most likely 3D pose for a given input image. However, a
single image can be highly ambiguous and induces multiple plausible solutions
for the 2D-3D lifting step which results in overly confident 3D pose
predictors. To this end, we propose \emph{DiffPose}, a conditional diffusion
model, that predicts multiple hypotheses for a given input image. In comparison
to similar approaches, our diffusion model is straightforward and avoids
intensive hyperparameter tuning, complex network structures, mode collapse, and
unstable training. Moreover, we tackle a problem of the common two-step
approach that first estimates a distribution of 2D joint locations via
joint-wise heatmaps and consecutively approximates them based on first- or
second-moment statistics. Since such a simplification of the heatmaps removes
valid information about possibly correct, though labeled unlikely, joint
locations, we propose to represent the heatmaps as a set of 2D joint candidate
samples. To extract information about the original distribution from these
samples we introduce our \emph{embedding transformer} that conditions the
diffusion model. Experimentally, we show that DiffPose slightly improves upon
the state of the art for multi-hypothesis pose estimation for simple poses and
outperforms it by a large margin for highly ambiguous poses.

interactions between entities represented as vertices of a graph. Despite
recent efforts to theoretically analyze the expressive power of GNNs, a formal
characterization of their ability to model interactions is lacking. The current
paper aims to address this gap. Formalizing strength of interactions through an
established measure known as separation rank, we quantify the ability of
certain GNNs to model interaction between a given subset of vertices and its
complement, i.e. between the sides of a given partition of input vertices. Our
results reveal that the ability to model interaction is primarily determined by
the partition's walk index -- a graph-theoretical characteristic defined by the
number of walks originating from the boundary of the partition. Experiments
with common GNN architectures corroborate this finding. As a practical
application of our theory, we design an edge sparsification algorithm named
Walk Index Sparsification (WIS), which preserves the ability of a GNN to model
interactions when input edges are removed. WIS is simple, computationally
efficient, and in our experiments has markedly outperformed alternative methods
in terms of induced prediction accuracy. More broadly, it showcases the
potential of improving GNNs by theoretically analyzing the interactions they
can model.

performance in learning and predicting on large-scale data present in social

represented as graphs, there has been a tremendous surge in employing GNNs for
machine learning (ML)-based methods for various aspects of IC design. Given
this trajectory, there is a timely need to review and discuss some powerful and
versatile GNN approaches for advancing IC design.
  In this paper, we propose a generic pipeline for tailoring GNN models toward
solving challenging problems for IC design. We outline promising options for
each pipeline element, and we discuss selected and promising works, like
leveraging GNNs to break SOTA logic obfuscation. Our comprehensive overview of
GNNs frameworks covers (i) electronic design automation (EDA) and IC design in
general, (ii) design of reliable ICs, and (iii) design as well as analysis of
secure ICs. We provide our overview and related resources also in the GNN4IC

43 devices were developed as part of this work and 6 devices were taken off the

precise reference sensor. A thorough analysis of data collected for seven
months has been presented to establish the need for dense deployment of PM
monitoring devices. Different analyses such as mean, variance, spatial
interpolation and correlation have been employed to generate interesting
insights about temporal and seasonal variations of PM. In addition,
event-driven spatio-temporal analysis is done for PM values to understand the
impact of the bursting of firecrackers on the evening of the Diwali festival. A
web-based dashboard is designed for real-time data visualization.

shortcoming of this is the fact that these deep neural networks cannot be
easily evaluated for robustness issues with respect to specific scene
variations. For example, it is hard to study the robustness of these networks
to variations of object scale, object pose, scene lighting and 3D occlusions.
The main reason is that collecting real datasets with fine-grained naturalistic
variations of sufficient scale can be extremely time-consuming and expensive.
In this work, we present Counterfactual Simulation Testing, a counterfactual
framework that allows us to study the robustness of neural networks with
respect to some of these naturalistic variations by building realistic
synthetic scenes that allow us to ask counterfactual questions to the models,
ultimately providing answers to questions such as ""Would your classification
still be correct if the object were viewed from the top?"" or ""Would your
classification still be correct if the object were partially occluded by
another object?"". Our method allows for a fair comparison of the robustness of
recently released, state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision
Transformers, with respect to these naturalistic variations. We find evidence
that ConvNext is more robust to pose and scale variations than Swin, that
ConvNext generalizes better to our simulated domain and that Swin handles
partial occlusion better than ConvNext. We also find that robustness for all
networks improves with network scale and with data scale and variety. We
release the Naturalistic Variation Object Dataset (NVD), a large simulated
dataset of 272k images of everyday objects with naturalistic variations such as
object pose, scale, viewpoint, lighting and occlusions. Project page:

$\{0, 1, \cdots, N\}^d$, in which edges are independently added between
far-away sites with probability falling off as a power of the Euclidean
distance. A natural question is how the resulting diameter of the box of size
$N$, measured in graph-theoretical distance, scales with $N$. This question has
been intensely studied in the past and the answer depends on the exponent $s$
in the connection probabilities. In this work we focus on the critical regime
$s = d$ studied earlier in a work by Coppersmith, Gamarnik, and Sviridenko and
improve the bounds obtained there to a sharp leading-order asymptotic, by
exploiting the high degree of concentration due to the large amount of

demonstrate that new vaccines reduce the total risk of a post-infection outcome
like transmission, symptomatic disease, severe illness, or death in randomized,
placebo-controlled trials. Given that infection is a necessary precondition for
a post-infection outcome, one can use principal stratification to partition the
total causal effect of vaccination into two causal effects: vaccine efficacy
against infection, and the principal effect of vaccine efficacy against a
post-infection outcome in the patients that would be infected under both
placebo and vaccination. Despite the importance of such principal effects to
policymakers, these estimands are generally unidentifiable, even under strong
assumptions that are rarely satisfied in real-world trials. We develop a novel
method to nonparametrically point identify these principal effects while
eliminating the monotonicity assumption and allowing for measurement error.
Furthermore, our results allow for multiple treatments, and are general enough
to be applicable outside of vaccine efficacy. Our method relies on the fact
that many vaccine trials are run at geographically disparate health centers,
and measure biologically-relevant categorical pretreatment covariates. We show
that our method can be applied to a variety of clinical trial settings where
vaccine efficacy against infection and a post-infection outcome can be jointly
inferred. This can yield new insights from existing vaccine efficacy trial data
and will aid researchers in designing new multi-arm clinical trials.

data perspective. Rather than collecting a new VL training dataset, we propose
a more scalable strategy, i.e., ""Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph
linearization for CommonsensE capability"" (DANCE). It can be viewed as one type
of data augmentation technique, which can inject commonsense knowledge into
existing VL datasets on the fly during training. More specifically, we leverage
the commonsense knowledge graph (e.g., ConceptNet) and create variants of text

better commonsense evaluation, we further propose the first retrieval-based

interior of other black holes along its worldline, elaborating on the ideas of
[2009.04476]. The key conceptual advance is a CFT criterion for selecting

depends on the choice of code subspace but not on the specific black hole
microstate and does not suffer from the ""frozen vacuum"" problem of other
approaches. By virtue of our construction, the question of firewall typicality
reduces to a technical problem we articulate and we identify a CFT correlator

organizing the sum over Feynman diagrams by the number of loops $\ell$, we show
that the two-point function in the massless case can be expressed as a sum over

masses determined by $\ell$. The two-point function of the massive theory has
the same structure given by a sum over boundary-to-boundary propagators but on
a geometry different than AdS. The coefficients in the sum contain information
on the putative string geometry dual to the interacting QFT. We also consider
the three-point function in the field theory and show that it can again be

depends on galactic environment and gravitational interactions in the context
of galaxy evolution. We explore the scaling relation between the star formation
rate (SFR) surface density and the molecular gas surface density, also known as
the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, in a subsample of Virgo cluster spiral
galaxies. We use new ACA and TP observations from the VERTICO-ALMA Large
Program at 720pc resolution to resolve the molecular gas content, as traced by
the 12CO(2-1) transition, across the disks of 37 spiral galaxies in the Virgo
cluster. In combination with archival observations, we estimate the parameters
of the KS relation for the entire ensemble of galaxies, and within individual
galaxies. We find the KS slope for the entire population to be N=0.97+/-0.07,
with a characteristic molecular gas depletion time of 1.86Gyr for our full
sample, in agreement with previous work in isolated star-forming galaxies. In
individual galaxies, we find KS slopes ranging between 0.69 and 1.40, and
typical star formation efficiencies (SFE) that can vary from galaxy to galaxy
by a factor of ~4. These galaxy-to-galaxy variations account for ~0.20dex in
scatter in the ensemble KS relation, which is characterized by a 0.42dex
scatter. We find that the HI-deficient galaxies in the Virgo cluster show a
steeper resolved KS relation and lower molecular gas efficiencies than
HI-normal cluster galaxies. While the molecular gas content in Virgo cluster
galaxies appears to behave similarly to that in isolated galaxies, our VERTICO
sample shows that cluster environments play a key role in regulating star
formation. The environmental mechanisms affecting the HI galaxy content also
have a direct impact in the SFE of molecular gas in cluster galaxies, leading
to longer depletion times in HI-deficient members.

simulate physical systems on quantum computers due to coherence time
limitations. With regards to Hamiltonian simulation, a significant effort has
focused on building efficient algorithms using various factorizations and
truncations, typically derived from the Hamiltonian alone. We introduce a new
paradigm for improving Hamiltonian simulation and reducing the cost of ground
state problems based on ideas recently developed for classical chemistry
simulations. The key idea is that one can find efficient ways to reduce
resources needed by quantum algorithms by making use of two key pieces of
information: the Hamiltonian operator and an approximate ground state
wavefunction. We refer to our algorithm as the $\textit{Self-consistent Quantum
Iteratively Sparsified Hamiltonian}$ (SQuISH). By performing our scheme
iteratively, one can drive SQuISH to create an accurate wavefunction using a
truncated, resource-efficient Hamiltonian. Utilizing this truncated Hamiltonian
provides an approach to reduce the gate complexity of ground state calculations
on quantum hardware. As proof of principle, we implement SQuISH using
configuration interaction for small molecules and coupled cluster for larger
systems. Through our combination of approaches, we demonstrate how SQuISH
performs on a range of systems, the largest of which would require more than
200 qubits to run on quantum hardware. Though our demonstrations are on a
series of electronic structure problems, our approach is relatively generic and
hence likely to benefit additional applications where the size of the problem
Hamiltonian creates a computational bottleneck.

century, especially the gradual evaporation of GCs via two-body relaxation
coupled with external tides. More violent ejection can also occur via strong
gravitational scattering, supernovae, gravitational wave-driven mergers, tidal
disruption events, and physical collisions, but comprehensive study of the many
escape mechanisms has been limited. Recent exquisite kinematic data from the
Gaia space telescope has revealed numerous stellar streams in the Milky Way
(MW) and traced the origin of many to specific MWGCs, highlighting the need for
further examination of stellar escape from these clusters. In this study, the
first of a series, we lay the groundwork for detailed follow-up comparisons
between Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) GC models and the latest Gaia data on the
outskirts of MWGCs, their tidal tails, and associated streams. We thoroughly
review escape mechanisms from GCs and examine their relative contributions to
the escape rate, ejection velocities, and escaper demographics. We show for the
first time that three-body binary formation may dominate high-speed ejection
from typical MWGCs, potentially explaining some of the hypervelocity stars in
the MW. Due to their mass, black holes strongly catalyze this process, and
their loss at the onset of observable core collapse, characterized by a steep
central brightness profile, dramatically curtails three-body binary formation,
despite the increased post-collapse density. We also demonstrate that even when
born from a thermal eccentricity distribution, escaping binaries have
significantly nonthermal eccentricities consistent with the roughly uniform
distribution observed in the Galactic field.

Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of the afterglows of long Gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) provide a powerful diagnostic tool to probe the interstellar medium
(ISM) of their host galaxies and foreground absorbers, even up to the highest
redshifts. We analyze the VLT/X-shooter afterglow spectrum of GRB 210905A,
triggered by the Swift Neil Gehrels Observatory, and detect neutral-hydrogen,
low-ionization, high-ionization, and fine-structure absorption lines from a
complex system at z=6.3118, that we associate with the GRB host galaxy. We
study the ISM properties of the host system, revealing the metallicity,
kinematics and chemical abundance pattern. The total metallicity of the z~6.3
system is [M/H]=-1.72+/-0.13, after correcting for dust-depletion and taking
into account alpha-element enhancement. In addition, we determine the overall
amount of dust and dust-to-metal mass ratio (DTM) ([Zn/Fe]_fit=0.33+/-0.09,
DTM=0.18+/-0.03). We find indications of nucleosynthesis due to massive stars
and evidence of peculiar over-abundance of aluminium. From the analysis of
fine-structure lines, we determine distances of several kpc for the
low-ionization gas clouds closest to the GRB. Those farther distances are
possibly due to the high number of ionizing photons. Using the HST/F140W image
of the GRB field, we show the GRB host galaxy as well as multiple objects
within 2"" from the GRB. We discuss the galaxy structure and kinematics that
could explain our observations, also taking into account a tentative detection
of Lyman-alpha emission. Deep spectroscopic observations with VLT/MUSE and JWST
will offer the unique possibility of combining our results with the ionized-gas
properties, with the goal of better understanding how galaxies in the

most common form of moderation, and has accordingly underpinned many recent
efforts at introducing automation into the moderation process. Comparatively
less work has been done to understand other moderation paradigms -- such as
proactively discouraging the emergence of antisocial behavior rather than
reacting to it -- and the role algorithmic support can play in these paradigms.

case study of a collaborative setting: Wikipedia Talk Pages. We employ a mixed
methods approach, combining qualitative and design components for a holistic
analysis. Through interviews with moderators, we find that despite a lack of
technical and social support, moderators already engage in a number of
proactive moderation behaviors, such as preemptively intervening in
conversations to keep them on track. Further, we explore how automation could
assist with this existing proactive moderation workflow by building a prototype
tool, presenting it to moderators, and examining how the assistance it provides
might fit into their workflow. The resulting feedback uncovers both strengths

developing such assisting technology so it can most effectively support

within the Einstein radius of approximately 42 kpc, and stellar-over-total mass
fractions ranging from ($49 \pm 12$)%, at the half-light radius ($R_e = 9.3$

These results suggest that the baryonic mass component of SDSS J0100+1818 is
very concentrated in its core and that the lens early-type galaxy/group is
immersed in a massive dark matter halo. This is consistent with what found in
other ultra-high mass candidates at intermediate redshift. We measure also the
physical sizes of the distant sources, resolving them down to a few hundreds of
parsec. Finally, we quantify and discuss a relevant source of systematic
uncertainties on the reconstructed sizes of background galaxies, associated to

when supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies violently
disrupt a star that passes too close. TDEs provide a new window to study
accretion onto SMBHs; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of
a relativistic jet, but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The
best studied jetted TDE to date is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in
gamma-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths.
Here we report the optical discovery of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at
cosmological distance (redshift z=1.19325) whose unique lightcurve transitioned
into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at
other wavelengths, including X-rays, sub-millimeter, and radio, supports the
interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron
""afterglow"", likely launched by a SMBH with spin $a \gtrsim 0.3$. Using 4 years
of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey data, we calculate a rate of $0.02

luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary
to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations. Correcting for the
beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that about 1% of TDEs have
relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a

differentiate it from the Keplerian profile of the disk; and its atomic nature
hints at a localized UV source strong enough to dissociate CO and launch a C I
outflow, or a strong polar flow from the upper layers of the disk. By
discarding the stellar jet and previously observed molecular winds, we explore
different sources for this kinematic feature in C I emission that could be
associated with a protoplanet inflow/outflow, or disk winds.

compare to a control sample of mass- and redshift-matched star-forming and
quiescent galaxies from the Large Early Galaxy Census and find that
post-starburst galaxies are more likely to be classified as disturbed than
either category. This corresponds to a factor of $3.6^{+2.9}_{-1.3}$ times the
disturbance rate of older quiescent galaxies and $2.1^{+1.9}_{-.73}$ times the
disturbance rate of star-forming galaxies. Assuming tidal features persist for
$\lesssim500$ Myr, this suggests merging is coincident with quenching in a
significant fraction of these post-starbursts. Galaxies with tidal disturbances
are younger on average than undisturbed post-starburst galaxies in our sample,
suggesting tidal features from a major merger may have faded over time. This
may be exacerbated by the fact that, on average, the undisturbed subset is
fainter, rendering low surface brightness tidal features harder to identify.
However, the presence of ten young ($\lesssim150$ Myr since quenching)
undisturbed galaxies suggests that major mergers are not the only fast physical
mechanism that shut down the primary epoch of star formation in massive
galaxies at intermediate redshift.

Thus, our construction assumes the existence of a family of solutions to the

a star. If this jet fortuitously aligns with our line of sight, the overall
brightness is Doppler boosted by several orders of magnitude. Consequently,
such on-axis relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs) have the potential to
unveil cosmological (redshift $z>$1) quiescent black holes and are ideal test
beds to understand the radiative mechanisms operating in super-Eddington jets.
Here, we present multi-wavelength (X-ray, UV, optical, and radio) observations
of the optically discovered transient \target at $z=1.193$. Its unusual X-ray
properties, including a peak observed luminosity of $\gtrsim$10$^{48}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, systematic variability on timescales as short as 1000 seconds, and
overall duration lasting more than 30 days in the rest-frame are traits
associated with relativistic TDEs. The X-ray to radio spectral energy
distributions spanning 5-50 days after discovery can be explained as
synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet (radio), synchrotron self-Compton
(X-rays), and thermal emission similar to that seen in low-redshift TDEs
(UV/optical). Our modeling implies a beamed, highly relativistic jet akin to
blazars but requires extreme matter-domination, i.e, high ratio of
electron-to-magnetic field energy densities in the jet, and challenges our
theoretical understanding of jets.

content of a galaxy and its star formation rate (SFR), being crucial for any
model of galaxy formation and evolution. A well known example of such laws is
the Schmidt-Kennicutt law, which is based on the projected surface densities.
However, it has been long unclear whether a more fundamental relation exists
between the intrinsic volume densities. By assuming the vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium, we infer radial profiles for the thickness of gaseous discs in a
sample of 23 local galaxies, and use these measurements to convert the observed
surface densities of the gas and the SFR into the de-projected volume
densities. We find a tight correlation linking these quantities, that we call
the volumetric star formation law. This relation and its properties have
crucial implications for our understanding of the physics of star formation.

nature of such turbulence was long unclear, as even the main candidate,
supernova (SN) feedback, seemed insufficient. Other mechanisms have been
proposed, but without reaching a general consensus. The key novelty of our work
is considering that the gas disc thickness and flaring increase the dissipation
timescale of turbulence, thus reducing the energy injection rate required to
sustain it. In excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations, we found
that the fraction of the SN energy (a.k.a. SN coupling efficiency) needed to
maintain the cold gas turbulence is $\sim 1$%, solving a long-standing

transcervical view. Firstly, we perform a novel MRI-transcervical 3D US
registration study. Secondly, we develop a US-robot calibration method with an

real-time endoscope images inside the surgeon console. Results: Our AR system
reaches a mean projection error of 26.81 and 27.85 pixels for the projection
from the US to stereo cameras in a water bath experiment. The average target
registration error for MRI to 3D US is 8.90 mm for the 3D US transducer and
5.85 mm for freehand 3D US, and the average distance between the vessel
centerlines is 2.32 mm. Conclusion: We demonstrate the first proof-of-concept

significant shortcoming: its variance does not decrease as more data are
acquired. Statisticians have a 60-year history of developing
variance-suppressing power spectrum estimators, but most are not used in
astronomy because they are formulated for time series with uniform observing
cadence and without seasonal or daily gaps. Here we demonstrate how to apply
the missing-data multitaper power spectrum estimator to spacecraft data with
uniform time intervals between observations but missing data during thruster
fires or momentum dumps. The F-test for harmonic components may be applied to
multitaper power spectrum estimates to identify statistically significant
oscillations that would not rise above a white noise-based false alarm level.
Multitapering improves the dynamic range of the power spectrum estimate and
suppresses spectral window artifacts. We demonstrate multitapering on
simultaneous measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field and the solar
10.7-cm radio flux, finding high coherence at frequencies associated with the
sun's activity cycle and quasibiennial oscillations. Next we show that the
multitaper--F-test combination applied to Kepler observations of KIC 6102338
detects differential rotation without requiring iterative sinusoid fitting and
subtraction. Significant signals reside at harmonics of both rotation
frequencies and suggest an antisolar rotation profile. Finally, we demonstrate
the missing-data multitaper version of complex demodulation, which extracts the
low-frequency envelope from a modulated signal. We argue that multitaper power
spectrum estimators should be used for all time series with regular observing

promising candidates for demonstrating practical quantum advantage. In
particular, quantum kernel methods have been demonstrated to be able to learn
certain classically intractable functions efficiently if the kernel is
well-aligned with the target function. In the more general case, quantum
kernels are known to suffer from exponential ""flattening"" of the spectrum as
the number of qubits grows, preventing generalization and necessitating the
control of the inductive bias by hyperparameters. We show that the
general-purpose hyperparameter tuning techniques proposed to improve the
generalization of quantum kernels lead to the kernel becoming well-approximated
by a classical kernel, removing the possibility of quantum advantage. We
provide extensive numerical evidence for this phenomenon utilizing multiple
previously studied quantum feature maps and both synthetic and real data. Our
results show that unless novel techniques are developed to control the
inductive bias of quantum kernels, they are unlikely to provide a quantum
advantage on classical data.

yields interpretable dendrograms of hierarchically clustered embeddings. Thus
our approach improves significantly on existing methods for identifying patient

our RECaST transfer learning approach can be applied to a continuous or

wind, whose interaction with the slow solar wind creates corotating interaction
regions (CIRs) in the heliosphere. Whenever the CIRs hit the Earth, they can
cause geomagnetic storms. We develop a method to predict the strength of
CIR/HSS-driven geomagnetic storms directly from solar observations using the CH
areas and associated magnetic field polarity. First, we build a dataset
comprising the properties of CHs on the Sun, the associated HSSs, CIRs, and
orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at L1, and the strength
of the associated geomagnetic storms by the geomagnetic indices Dst and Kp.
Then, we predict the Dst and Kp indices using a Gaussian Process model, which
accounts for the annual variation of the orientation of Earth's magnetic field
axis. We demonstrate that the polarity of the IMF at L1 associated with CIRs is
preserved in around 83% of cases when compared to the polarity of their CH
sources. Testing our model over the period 2010-2020, we obtained a correlation
coefficient between the predicted and observed Dst index of R = 0.63/0.73, and
Kp index of R = 0.65/0.67, for HSSs having a polarity towards/away from the
Sun. These findings demonstrate the possibility of predicting CIR/HSS-driven
geomagnetic storms directly from solar observations and extending the
forecasting lead time up to several days, which is relevant for enhancing space

with continuous design variables and a finite scenario set. To reduce the
number of simulations required and increase the number of restarts for better
local optimum solutions, we propose a new approach referred to as adaptive
scenario subset selection (AS3). The proposed approach subsamples a scenario
subset as a support to construct the worst-case function in a given
neighborhood, and we introduce such a scenario subset. Moreover, we develop a
new optimization algorithm by combining AS3 and the covariance matrix
adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), denoted AS3-CMA-ES. At each algorithmic
iteration, a subset of support scenarios is selected, and CMA-ES attempts to
optimize the worst-case objective computed only through a subset of the
scenarios. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of simulations required by
executing simulations on only a scenario subset, rather than on all scenarios.
In numerical experiments, we verified that AS3-CMA-ES is more efficient in
terms of the number of simulations than the brute-force approach and a
surrogate-assisted approach lq-CMA-ES when the ratio of the number of support
scenarios to the total number of scenarios is relatively small. In addition,
the usefulness of AS3-CMA-ES was evaluated for well placement optimization for
carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). In comparison with the brute-force
approach and lq-CMA-ES, AS3-CMA-ES was able to find better solutions because of
more frequent restarts.

percent of late-type galaxies display a global non-axisymmetric lopsided mass
distribution, but little attention has been paid to the origin of this
perturbation. In this work, we study the origin of lopsided perturbations in
simulated disc galaxies extracted from the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG
project. We statistically explore different excitation mechanisms for this
perturbation, such as direct satellite tidal interactions and distortions of
the underlying dark matter distributions. We also characterize the main
physical conditions that lead to lopsided perturbations. 50 percent of our
sample galaxy have lopsided modes $m=1$ greater than ~0.12. We find a strong
correlation between internal galaxy properties, such as central stellar surface
density and disc radial extension with the strength of lopsided modes. The
majority of lopsided galaxies have lower central surface densities and more
extended discs than symmetric galaxies. As a result, such lopsided galaxies are
less self-gravitationally cohesive, and their outer disc region is more
susceptible to different types of external perturbations. However, we do not
find strong evidence that tidal interactions with satellite galaxies are the
main driving agent of lopsided modes. Lopsided galaxies tend to live in
asymmetric dark matter halos with high spin, indicating strong galaxy-halo
connections in late-type lopsided galaxies.

seen at the smallest inter-satellite separations are likely associated with
whistler-mode chorus elements or with the scale of chorus wave packets (0.1 - 1

L-shell profiles at intermediate inter-satellite separations are likely
associated with whistler-mode wave power modulations by ultra-low frequency
(ULF) waves, i.e., with the wave source region (from a few to tens of seconds
to a few minutes in time and 1000km in space at the equator). During these two
types of variations, consecutive crossings are associated with precipitation
L-shell profiles very similar to each other. Therefore the spatial and temporal
variations at those scales do not change the net electron loss from the outer
radiation belt. Variations at the largest range of inter-satellite separations,
several minutes to more than 10 min, are likely associated with mesoscale
equatorial plasma structures that are affected by convection (at minutes to
tens of minutes temporal variations and [1000,10000]km spatial scales). The

  Our main technique is developing tools to vary the trade-off between

particular family of convex-programming based matchings that distribute the
demand in a specifically balanced way among supply in different stages, while
carefully modifying the balancedness of the resulting matching across stages.
More precisely, we identify a sequence of polynomials with decreasing degrees
to be used as strictly concave regularizers of the maximum weight matching
linear program to form these convex programs. At each stage, our algorithm
returns the corresponding regularized optimal solution as the matching of this
stage (by solving the convex program). Using structural properties of these

develop a new multi-stage primal-dual framework to analyze the competitive

costly and error-prone. As a result, a variety of model inference methods that
automatically construct models from execution traces have been proposed to
address these issues.
  However, performing a systematic and reliable accuracy assessment of inferred
models remains an open problem. Even when a reference model is given, most
existing model accuracy assessment methods may return misleading and biased
results. This is mainly due to their reliance on statistical estimators over a
finite number of randomly generated traces, introducing avoidable uncertainty
about the estimation and being sensitive to the parameters of the random trace
generative process.
  This paper addresses this problem by developing a systematic approach based
on analytic combinatorics that minimizes bias and uncertainty in model accuracy
assessment by replacing statistical estimation with deterministic accuracy
measures. We experimentally demonstrate the consistency and applicability of

characterize using VCMA and SOT to generate random bit streams. The results
show that both methods produce high quality, uniformly distributed bitstreams.
Biasing the bitstreams using either STT current or an applied magnetic field
shows an approximately sigmoidal distribution vs. bias amplitude for both VCMA

promise for advancing artificial intelligence. They endow systems with self
learning capabilities, efficient energy usage, and high storage capacity. A
core concept that lies at the heart of brain computation is sequence learning
and prediction. This form of computation is essential for almost all our daily
tasks such as movement generation, perception, and language. Understanding how
the brain performs such a computation is not only important to advance
neuroscience but also to pave the way to new technological brain-inspired
applications. A previously developed spiking neural network implementation of
sequence prediction and recall learns complex, high-order sequences in an
unsupervised manner by local, biologically inspired plasticity rules. An
emerging type of hardware that holds promise for efficiently running this type
of algorithm is neuromorphic hardware. It emulates the way the brain processes
information and maps neurons and synapses directly into a physical substrate.
Memristive devices have been identified as potential synaptic elements in
neuromorphic hardware. In particular, redox-induced resistive random access
memories (ReRAM) devices stand out at many aspects. They permit scalability,
are energy efficient and fast, and can implement biological plasticity rules.
In this work, we study the feasibility of using ReRAM devices as a replacement
of the biological synapses in the sequence learning model. We implement and
simulate the model including the ReRAM plasticity using the neural simulator
NEST. We investigate the effect of different device properties on the
performance characteristics of the sequence learning model, and demonstrate
resilience with respect to different on-off ratios, conductance resolutions,
device variability, and synaptic failure.

Comments welcome",,,"FERMILAB-PUB-22-877-PPD","astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fiducial cosmological analyses of imaging galaxy surveys like the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) typically probe the Universe at redshifts $z < 1$. This is
mainly because of the limited depth of these surveys, and also because such
analyses rely heavily on galaxy lensing, which is more efficient at low
redshifts. In this work we present the selection and characterization of
high-redshift galaxy samples using DES Year 3 data, and the analysis of their
galaxy clustering measurements. In particular, we use galaxies that are fainter
than those used in the previous DES Year 3 analyses and a Bayesian redshift
scheme to define three tomographic bins with mean redshifts around $z \sim
0.9$, $1.2$ and $1.5$, which significantly extend the redshift coverage of the
fiducial DES Year 3 analysis. These samples contain a total of about 9 million
galaxies, and their galaxy density is more than 2 times higher than those in
the DES Year 3 fiducial case. We characterize the redshift uncertainties of the
samples, including the usage of various spectroscopic and high-quality redshift
samples, and we develop a machine-learning method to correct for correlations
between galaxy density and survey observing conditions. The analysis of galaxy
clustering measurements, with a total signal-to-noise $S/N \sim 70$ after scale
cuts, yields robust cosmological constraints on a combination of the fraction
of matter in the Universe $\Omega_m$ and the Hubble parameter $h$, $\Omega_m h
= 0.195^{+0.023}_{-0.018}$, and 2-3% measurements of the amplitude of the
galaxy clustering signals, probing galaxy bias and the amplitude of matter
fluctuations, $b \sigma_8$. A companion paper $\textit{(in preparation)}$ will
present the cross-correlations of these high-$z$ samples with CMB lensing from
Planck and SPT, and the cosmological analysis of those measurements in
combination with the galaxy clustering presented in this work.

powerful tool for many visual understanding tasks. Notably, many
vision-language models build two encoders (visual and textual) that can map two
modalities into the same embedding space. As a result, the learned
representations achieve good zero-shot performance on tasks like image
classification. However, when there are only a few examples per category, the
potential of large vision-language models is often underperformed, mainly due
to the gap between a large number of parameters and a relatively small amount
of training data. This paper shows that we can significantly improve the
performance of few-shot classification by using the category names to
initialize the classification head. With the proposed category name
initialization method, our model obtains the state-of-the-art performance on a
number of few-shot image classification benchmarks (e.g., 87.37% on ImageNet
and 96.08% on Stanford Cars, both using five-shot learning).

number of unital subrings (resp. unital irreducible subrings) of $\mathbb{Z}^n$
of index $k$. The numbers $f_n(k)$ are coefficients of certain zeta functions
of natural interest. The function $k\mapsto f_n(k)$ is multiplicative, and the
study of the numbers $f_n(k)$ reduces to computing the values at prime powers
$k=p^e$. Given a composition $\alpha=(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{n-1})$ of $e$
into $n-1$ positive integers, let $g_\alpha(p)$ denote the number of
irreducible subrings of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for which the associated upper
triangular matrix in Hermite normal form has diagonal $(p^{\alpha_1}, \dots,
p^{\alpha_{n-1}},1)$. Via combinatorial analysis, the computation of $f_n(p^e)$
reduces to the computation of $g_\alpha(p)$ for all compositions of $i$ into
$j$ parts, where $i\leq e$ and $j\leq n-1$. We extend results of Liu and
Atanasov-Kaplan-Krakoff-Menzel, who explicitly compute $f_n(p^e)$ for $e\leq
8$. The case $e=9$ proves to be significantly more involved. We evaluate
$f_n(e^9)$ explicitly in terms of a polynomial in n and p up to a single term
which is conjecturally a polynomial. Our results provide further evidence for a
conjecture, which states that for any fixed pair $(n,e)$, the function
$p\mapsto f_n(p^e)$ is a polynomial in $p$. A conjecture of Bhargava on the
asymptotics for $f_n(k)$ as a function of $k$ motivates the study of the
asymptotics for $g_\alpha(p)$ for certain infinite families of compositions
$\alpha$, for which we are able to obtain general estimates using techniques
from the geometry of numbers.

the time-invariance of the underlying data to construct a superimposed dataset
of the system state before rare events happen at different timesteps. We then
design a conditional independence test on the reorganized data. We provide
non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds for the consistency of our method, and
validate its performance across various simulated and real-world datasets,
including incident data collected from the Caltrans Performance Measurement

VLSR exceeding that permitted by circular rotation in their direction. Most of
the clouds in the Leading Component show evidence that they are interacting

Leading Component crosses the Galactic plane at a distance from the Sun of 9.5
kpc, about 4.5 kpc from the Galactic Center. Its HI mass may be as high as 10^6
Solar masses, comparable to the mass of the neutral component of the Smith
Cloud, but only a fraction of this is contained in clouds that are resolved in
the GBT data. Like the Smith Cloud, the Leading Component appears to be adding
mass and angular momentum to the ISM in the inner Galaxy. We suggest that the

of information to increase efficiency and reveal general patterns. Yet, this
simplification also forfeits information, thereby reducing representational
capacity. Hence, the brain may benefit from generating both compressed and
uncompressed activity, and may do so in a heterogeneous manner across diverse
neural circuits that represent low-level (sensory) or high-level (cognitive)
stimuli. However, precisely how compression and representational capacity
differ across the cortex remains unknown. Here we predict different levels of
compression across regional circuits by using random walks on networks to model
activity flow and to formulate rate-distortion functions, which are the basis
of lossy compression. Using a large sample of youth ($n=1,040$), we test
predictions in two ways: by measuring the dimensionality of spontaneous
activity from sensorimotor to association cortex, and by assessing the
representational capacity for 24 behaviors in neural circuits and 20 cognitive
variables in recurrent neural networks. Our network theory of compression
predicts the dimensionality of activity ($t=12.13, p<0.001$) and the
representational capacity of biological ($r=0.53, p=0.016$) and artificial
($r=0.61, p<0.001$) networks. The model suggests how a basic form of
compression is an emergent property of activity flow between distributed
circuits that communicate with the rest of the network.

codes. To this end, we first present the benchmarking of our newly developed
full-2D PIC code. Next, we provide an overview of the reduced-order PIC scheme
and the resulting ""quasi-2D"" code, specifying that the degree of order
reduction in the quasi-2D PIC is defined in terms of the number of ""regions""
along the simulation's directions used to divide the computational domain. We
compare the predictions of the quasi-2D simulation in various approximation
degrees of the 2D problem against our full-2D simulation results. We show that,
by increasing the number of regions in the Q2D simulations, the quasi-2D
results converge to the 2D ones. Nonetheless, we also highlight that a quasi-2D
simulation that provides a factor of 5 reduction in the computational cost
resolves the underlying physical processes in an almost indistinguishable
manner with respect to the full-2D simulation and incurs a maximum error of
only about 10 % in the ion number density and about 5 % in the electron
temperature.

that involves the creation of Dirac particles at a point source in 3d space.
Its definition makes use of an interior-boundary condition. Here, we develop
for this Hamiltonian a corresponding theory of the Bohmian configuration. That
is, we construct a Markov jump process $(Q_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ in the
configuration space of a variable number of particles that is
$|\psi_t|^2$-distributed at every time $t$ and follows Bohmian trajectories
between the jumps. The jumps correspond to particle creation or annihilation
events and occur either to or from a configuration with a particle located at
the source. The process is the natural analog of Bell's jump process, and a
central piece in its construction is the determination of the rate of particle
creation. The construction requires an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of
the Bohmian trajectories near the source. We find that the particle reaches the
source with radial speed 0, but orbits around the source infinitely many times
in finite time before absorption (or after emission).

predicting the future of one of the variables (the target stream) can benefit
from information about both its history and the history of the other variable
(the source stream). For example, fluctuations in temperature at a weather
station can be predicted using both temperatures and barometric readings.
However, a challenge when modelling such data is that it is easy for a neural
network to rely on the greatest joint correlations within the target stream,
which may ignore a crucial but small information transfer from the source to
the target stream. As well, there are often situations where the target stream
may have previously been modelled independently and it would be useful to use
that model to inform a new joint model. Here, we develop an information
bottleneck approach for conditional learning on two dependent streams of data.
Our method, which we call Transfer Entropy Bottleneck (TEB), allows one to
learn a model that bottlenecks the directed information transferred from the
source variable to the target variable, while quantifying this information
transfer within the model. As such, TEB provides a useful new information
bottleneck approach for modelling two statistically dependent streams of data
in order to make predictions about one of them.

new avenue of polariton chemistry where excited state dynamics, driven by

Along with this, the photonic down conversion is potentially useful in both the

more significant profit, many landlords are no longer renting out their houses
under long-term tenancies but under short-term tenancies. The shift from
long-term to short-term rentals has harmed the supply of private housing
rentals. Regulating rentals in Rent Pressure Zones with the highest and rising
rents is becoming a tricky issue.
  In this paper, we develop a breach identifier to check short-term rentals
located in Rent Pressure Zones with potential breaches only using publicly
available data from Airbnb (an online marketplace focused on short-term
home-stays). First, we use a Residual Neural Network to filter out outdoor
landscape photos that negatively impact identifying whether an owner has
multiple rentals in a Rent Pressure Zone. Second, a Siamese Neural Network is
used to compare the similarity of indoor photos to determine if multiple rental
posts correspond to the same residence. Next, we use the Haversine algorithm to
locate short-term rentals within a circle centered on the coordinate of a
permit. Short-term rentals with a permit will not be restricted. Finally, we
improve the occupancy estimation model combined with sentiment analysis, which
may provide higher accuracy.
  Because Airbnb does not disclose accurate house coordinates and occupancy
data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of our breach identifier. The
accuracy of the occupancy estimator cannot be verified either. It only provides
an estimate within a reasonable range. Users should be skeptical of short-term
rentals that are flagged as possible breaches.

cybersecurity outcomes by using it offensively to consume attackers' time and
other resources.
  To date, most cyber defenses have been designed to be optimally strong and
effective and prohibit or eliminate attackers as quickly as possible. Our
complimentary approach is to also deploy defenses that seek to maximize the
consumption of the attackers' time and other resources while causing as little
damage as possible to the victim. This is consistent with zero trust and
similar mindsets which assume breach. The Sludge Strategy introduces
cost-imposing cyber defense by strategically deploying friction for attackers
before, during, and after an attack using deception and authentic design

continuum from light to heavy sludge. We describe the quantitative and
qualitative costs to attackers and offer practical considerations for deploying
sludge in practice. Finally, we examine real-world examples of U.S. government

numerical simulation of the aerodynamic breakup of a vaporizing drop. The
interfacial multiphase flow with phase change is resolved using a consistent
geometric volume-of-fluid method. The bulk fluids are viscous and
incompressible with surface tension at the interface. The newly-developed
numerical methods have been implemented in the Basilisk solver, in which the
adaptive octree/quadtree mesh is used for spatial discretization, allowing
flexibility in dynamically refining the mesh in a user-defined region. The
simulation framework is extensively validated by a series of benchmark cases,
including the 1D Stefan and sucking problems, the growth of a 3D spherical
bubble in a superheated liquid, and a 2D film boiling problem. The simulation
results agree very well with the exact solution and previous numerical studies.
2D axisymmetric simulations were performed to resolve the vaporization of a
moving drop with a low Weber number in a high-temperature free stream. The
computed rate of volume loss agrees well with the empirical model of drop
evaporation. Finally, the validated solver is used to simulate the aerodynamic
breakup of an acetone drop at a high Weber number. A fully 3D simulation is
performed and the morphological evolution of the drop is accurately resolved.
The rate of vaporization is found to be significantly enhanced due to the drop
deformation and breakup. The drop volume decreases nonlinearly in time and at a
much higher rate than the empirical correlation for a spherical drop.

spatiotemporal smoothing that pools information over time and space to address
statistical instability due to small population counts or stochasticity

risk associated with geographic locations over time. Third, estimation of
COVID-19 mortality associations with county-level covariates conditional on a

(WSI) for downstream tasks is critical. Previous studies employ multiple
instance learning (MIL) to represent WSIs as bags of sampled patches because,
for most occasions, only slide-level labels are available, and only a tiny
region of the WSI is disease-positive area. However, WSI representation
learning still remains an open problem due to: (1) patch sampling on a higher
resolution may be incapable of depicting microenvironment information such as
the relative position between the tumor cells and surrounding tissues, while
patches at lower resolution lose the fine-grained detail; (2) extracting
patches from giant WSI results in large bag size, which tremendously increases
the computational cost. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a
hierarchical-based multimodal transformer framework that learns a hierarchical
mapping between pathology images and corresponding genes. Precisely, we
randomly extract instant-level patch features from WSIs with different
magnification. Then a co-attention mapping between imaging and genomics is
learned to uncover the pairwise interaction and reduce the space complexity of
imaging features. Such early fusion makes it computationally feasible to use
MIL Transformer for the survival prediction task. Our architecture requires
fewer GPU resources compared with benchmark methods while maintaining better
WSI representation ability. We evaluate our approach on five cancer types from
the Cancer Genome Atlas database and achieved an average c-index of $0.673$,
outperforming the state-of-the-art multimodality methods.

organized sparse memory after each Transformer layer. SPARTAN freezes the PLM
parameters and fine-tunes only its memory, thus significantly reducing storage
costs by re-using the PLM backbone for different tasks. SPARTAN contains two
levels of memory, with only a sparse subset of parents being chosen in the
first level for each input, and children cells corresponding to those parents
being used to compute an output representation. This sparsity combined with
other architecture optimizations improves SPARTAN's throughput by over 90%
during inference on a Raspberry Pi 4 when compared to PE baselines (adapters)
while also outperforming the latter by 0.1 points on the GLUE benchmark.
Further, it can be trained 34% faster in a few-shot setting, while performing
within 0.9 points of adapters. Qualitative analysis shows that different parent

generative transformer-based approach to generating scene graphs beyond link
prediction. Using two transformer-based components, we first sample a possible
scene graph structure from detected objects and their visual features. We then
perform predicate classification on the sampled edges to generate the final
scene graph. This approach allows us to efficiently generate scene graphs from
images with minimal inference overhead. Extensive experiments on the Visual

impacting rates of reproduction, as well as alternative sources of mortality,
which have differential impacts on smaller to larger organisms. Here we derive
the timescales associated with four alternative sources of mortality for
terrestrial mammals: mortality from starvation, mortality associated with
aging, mortality from consumption by predators, and mortality introduced by
subsidized harvest. The incorporation of these allometric relationships into a
minimal consumer-resource model illuminates central constraints that may
contribute to the structure of mammalian communities. Our framework reveals
that while starvation largely impacts smaller-bodied species, the allometry of
senescence is expected to be more difficult to observe. In contrast, external
predation and subsidized harvest primarily influence larger-bodied species. The
inclusion of predation mortality reveals mass thresholds for mammalian
herbivores, where dynamic instabilities may limit the feasibility of megafaunal
populations. Moreover, we show how these thresholds vary with alternative
predator-prey mass ratios, a relationship that is little understood within
terrestrial systems. Finally, we use our framework to predict the harvest
pressure required to induce mass-specific extinctions, which closely align with
previous estimates of megafaunal exploitation in both paleontological and

  networks using algebraic invariants",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.AG stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivation: The abundance of gene flow in the Tree of Life challenges the
notion that evolution can be represented with a fully bifurcating process, as
this process cannot capture important biological realities like hybridization,
introgression, or horizontal gene transfer. Coalescent-based network methods
are increasingly popular, yet not scalable for big data, because they need to
perform a heuristic search in the space of networks as well as numerical
optimization that can be NP-hard.
  Results: Here, we introduce a novel method to reconstruct phylogenetic
networks based on algebraic invariants. While there is a long tradition of
using algebraic invariants in phylogenetics, our work is the first to define
phylogenetic invariants on concordance factors (frequencies of 4-taxon splits
in the input gene trees) to identify level-1 phylogenetic networks under the
multispecies coalescent model. Our novel inference methodology is
optimization-free as it only requires the evaluation of polynomial equations,
and as such, it bypasses the traversal of network space, yielding a
computational speed at least 10 times faster than the fastest-to-date network
methods. We illustrate the accuracy and speed of our new method on a variety of
simulated scenarios as well as in the estimation of a phylogenetic network for
the genus Canis.
  Availability and Implementation: We implement our novel theory on an
open-source publicly available Julia package PhyloDiamond.jl available at

decrease as the {\sc limepy}/{\sc spes} models predict beyond the truncation

A textbook dynamic programming algorithm gives an exact algorithm in quadratic

algorithms. When the inputs are two binary strings, there is a simple
$\frac{1}{2}$-approximation in linear time: compute the longest common all-0s

possible even in truly subquadratic time. Rubinstein and Song showed that the
answer is yes under the assumption that the two input strings have equal
lengths. We settle the question, generalizing their result to unequal length
strings, proving that, for any $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ and a
$(\frac{1}{2}+\delta)$-approximation algorithm for binary LCS that runs in

  Beamforming Design Approach","16 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions
  on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) achieve high passive beamforming
gains for signal enhancement or interference nulling by dynamically adjusting
their reflection coefficients. Their employment is particularly appealing for
improving both the wireless security and the efficiency of radio frequency
(RF)-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by this, we conceive and
investigate a RIS-assisted secure simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) system designed for information and power transfer from a base
station (BS) to an information user (IU) and to multiple energy users (EUs),
respectively. Moreover, the EUs are also potential eavesdroppers that may
overhear the communication between the BS and IU. We adopt two-timescale
transmission for reducing the signal processing complexity as well as channel
training overhead, and aim for maximizing the average worst-case secrecy rate
achieved by the IU. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the short-term
transmit beamforming vectors at the BS as well as the long-term phase shifts at
the RIS, under the energy harvesting constraints considered at the EUs and the
power constraint at the BS. The stochastic optimization problem formulated is
non-convex with intricately coupled variables, and is non-smooth due to the
existence of multiple EUs/eavesdroppers. No standard optimization approach is
available for this challenging scenario. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
smooth approximation aided stochastic successive convex approximation (SA-SSCA)
algorithm. Furthermore, a low-complexity heuristic algorithm is proposed for
reducing the computational complexity without unduly eroding the performance.
Simulation results show the efficiency of the RIS in securing SWIPT systems.
The significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over the
relevant benchmark schemes are also demonstrated.

outsize environmental impact. Sparse training (using a fixed number of nonzero
weights in each iteration) could significantly mitigate the training costs by
reducing the model size. However, existing sparse training methods mainly use
either random-based or greedy-based drop-and-grow strategies, resulting in
local minimal and low accuracy. In this work, we consider the dynamic sparse
training as a sparse connectivity search problem and design an exploitation and
exploration acquisition function to escape from local optima and saddle points.
We further design an acquisition function and provide the theoretical
guarantees for the proposed method and clarify its convergence property.
Experimental results show that sparse models (up to 98\% sparsity) obtained by
our proposed method outperform the SOTA sparse training methods on a wide
variety of deep learning tasks. On VGG-19 / CIFAR-100, ResNet-50 / CIFAR-10,

powerful tool for analyzing games in which an exact specification of the
utilities is unavailable. Instead, EGTA assumes access to an oracle, i.e., a
simulator, which can generate unbiased noisy samples of players' unknown
utilities, given a strategy profile. Utilities can thus be empirically
estimated by repeatedly querying the simulator. Recently, various progressive
sampling (PS) algorithms have been proposed, which aim to produce PAC-style
learning guarantees (e.g., approximate Nash equilibria with high probability)
using as few simulator queries as possible. One recent work introduces a
pruning technique called regret-pruning which further minimizes the number of
simulator queries placed in PS algorithms which aim to learn pure Nash
equilibria. In this paper, we address a serious limitation of this original
regret pruning approach -- it is only able to guarantee that true pure Nash
equilibria of the empirical game are approximate equilibria of the true game,
and is unable to provide any strong guarantees regarding the efficacy of
approximate pure Nash equilibria. This is a significant limitation since in
many games, pure Nash equilibria are computationally intractable to find, or
even non-existent. We introduce three novel regret pruning variations. The
first two variations generalize the original regret pruning approach to yield
guarantees for approximate pure Nash equilibria of the empirical game. The
third variation goes further to even yield strong guarantees for all
approximate mixed Nash equilibria of the empirical game. We use these regret
pruning variations to design two novel progressive sampling algorithms, PS-REG+
and PS-REG-M, which experimentally outperform the previous state-of-the-art
algorithms for learning pure and mixed equilibria, respectively, of
simulation-based games.

$M_\odot$ have dimensionless spins ranging between $\pm 0.05$, while component
masses between $3$ to $200$ $M_\odot$ have dimensionless spins ranging between
$\pm 0.99$, where we assume spin-aligned systems. The low-frequency cutoff is
$15$ Hz. The templates are placed in the parameter space according to the
metric via a binary tree approach which took $\mathcal{O}\left(10\right)$
minutes when jobs were parallelized. The template bank generated with this
method has a $98\%$ match or higher for $90\%$ of the injections, thus being as

the nearby templates have similar volumes in the coordinate space, henceforth,
enabling a more efficient and less biased implementation of population models.

they show consistent positive correlations between the QPO fractional
root-mean-square (rms) amplitude and non-thermal fraction of the emission,
which indicate an independence of the intrinsic QPO rms on individual outburst
brightness in H 1743--322. However, the dependence of the QPO rms on frequency
is different between the outburst rise and decay phases, where QPO fractional
rms of the decay phase is significantly lower than that of the rise phase at
low frequencies. The spectral analysis also reveals different ranges of coronal
temperature between the two outburst stages. A semi-quantitative analysis shows
that the Lense-Thirring precession model could be responsible for the QPO rms
differences, requiring a variable coronal geometric shape. However, the
variable-Comptonization model could also account for the findings. The fact
that the rms differences and the hysteresis traces in the hardness-intensity
diagram (HID) accompany each other indicates a connection between the two
phenomena. By correlating the findings with QPO phase lags and the
quasi-simultaneous radio flux previously published, we propose there could be
corona-jet transitions in H 1743--322 similar to those that have been recently

However, the long-range effect such as Coulomb and Van der Wales potential is

forward a method that can take long-range effects into account for most ML
local interatomic models with the reciprocal space neural network. The
structure information in real space is firstly transformed into reciprocal

with full atomic interactions. The reciprocal space potential and descriptor
keep full invariance of Euclidean symmetry and choice of the cell. Benefiting
from the reciprocal-space information, ML interatomic models can be extended to
describe the long-range potential including not only Coulomb but any other

charge transfer, strain, and superlattice structure of an interface by
leveraging the databases of individual bulk materials. Specifically, the
algorithm reads in the lattice vectors, density of states, and the stiffness
tensors for each material in their isolated form from the Materials Project.
From these bulk properties, InterMatch estimates the interfacial properties. We
benchmark InterMatch predictions for the charge transfer against experimental
measurements and supercell density-functional theory calculations. We then use
InterMatch to predict promising interface candidates for doping transition
metal dichalcogenide MoSe$_2$. Finally, we explain experimental observation of
factor of 10 variation in the supercell periodicity within a few microns in
graphene/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ by exploring low energy superlattice structures as a
function of twist angle using InterMatch. We anticipate our open-source
InterMatch algorithm accelerating and guiding ever-growing interfacial design

interactions among a solo set of nodes from real applications, such as the user
contact frequency from a social network services system. A graph convolutional
network (GCN) is widely adopted to perform representation learning to a UWG for
subsequent pattern analysis tasks such as clustering or missing data
estimation. However, existing GCNs mostly neglects the latent collaborative
information hidden in its connected node pairs. To address this issue, this
study proposes to model the node collaborations via a symmetric latent factor
analysis model, and then regards it as a node-collaboration module for
supplementing the collaboration loss in a GCN. Based on this idea, a
Node-collaboration-informed Graph Convolutional Network (NGCN) is proposed with
three-fold ideas: a) Learning latent collaborative information from the
interaction of node pairs via a node-collaboration module; b) Building the
residual connection and weighted representation propagation to obtain high
representation capacity; and c) Implementing the model optimization in an
end-to-end fashion to achieve precise representation to the target UWG.
Empirical studies on UWGs emerging from real applications demonstrate that
owing to its efficient incorporation of node-collaborations, the proposed NGCN
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCNs in addressing the task of
missing weight estimation. Meanwhile, its good scalability ensures its
compatibility with more advanced GCN extensions, which will be further

conformance checking. The algorithm is shown to be fast, memory-efficient, and
able to output both a prefix and a complete alignment event-by-event while
keeping track of previously seen cases and their state. Comparative analysis
against the current state-of-the-art algorithm for finding prefix-alignments
shows that the IWS algorithm achieves, in some cases, an order of magnitude
faster execution time while having a smaller error cost. In extreme cases, the
IWS finds prefix-alignments roughly three orders of magnitude faster than the
current state of the art. The IWS algorithm includes a discounted decay time
setting for efficient memory usage and a look-ahead limit for improving
computation time. Finally, the algorithm is stress tested for performance using
a simulation of high-traffic event streams.

sensors based on exceptional points, Parity-Time symmetric structures or
non-reciprocal systems. It is crucial to evaluate the fundamental limit of
these sensing schemes and to judge whether there is an enhanced performance.
Several papers have already investigated the fundamental limits based on
different aspects and criteria, some led to different conclusions. In this
paper, we suggest that for linear bosonic sensors that can be modeled as
coupled oscillators below threshold, a measurement of the mode frequency $w_0$
can not has a precision beyond $\frac{\sqrt{\kappa_0}}{2\sqrt{n\tau}}$, in
which $\kappa_{0}$ is the intrinsic loss, $n$ is the average particle number at
that mode and $\tau$ is the measurement time. Such a precision limit can
already be achieved for a single mode passive sensor, and we have proved that
it can not be exceeded by adding gain components, or by coupling it to other
modes to form a n-mode linear sensor. Further more, we recognize that the above
limit is comparative to the frequency uncertainty
($\frac{\sqrt{\kappa_0}}{\sqrt{2 n\tau}}$) for an above-threshold oscillation
mode (e.g. a laser cavity above threshold), which is related to the
Schawlow-Townes laser linewidth limit. This observation makes us conjecture
that the limit we proposed for linear sensors may be a basic general limit
which restricts most, if not all, sensors.

limits their compatibility with many global climate model outputs, often

capability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to downscale surface wind
speed data over land surface from different coarse resolutions (25 km, 48 km,

CNN configurations that generate super-resolved predictions of fine-scale wind

probability density function parameters are generated, through which sample
wind speeds can be generated accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of wind

different topography and climate that are unseen during training. The
evaluation of super-resolved predictions focuses on subgrid-scale variability

more attention in molecular property prediction (MPP) problems. The existing
graph methods have demonstrated that 3D geometric information is significant
for better performance in MPP. However, accurate 3D structures are often costly
and time-consuming to obtain, limiting the large-scale application of GRL. It
is an intuitive solution to train with 3D to 2D knowledge distillation and
predict with only 2D inputs. But some challenging problems remain open for 3D
to 2D distillation. One is that the 3D view is quite distinct from the 2D view,
and the other is that the gradient magnitudes of atoms in distillation are
discrepant and unstable due to the variable molecular size. To address these
challenging problems, we exclusively propose a distillation framework that
contains global molecular distillation and local atom distillation. We also
provide a theoretical insight to justify how to coordinate atom and molecular

information distillation. Experimental results on two popular molecular

We consider the scenario where a ground target without any exteroceptive
sensors must rely on an aerial observer for pose and uncertainty estimates to
localize itself along an obstacle-filled path. The observer uses a
downward-facing camera to estimate the target's pose and uncertainty. However,
the pose uncertainty is a function of the states of the observer, target, and
surrounding environment. To find an optimal state that minimizes the target's
localization uncertainty, DyFOS uses a localization error prediction pipeline
in an optimization search. Given the states mentioned above, the pipeline
predicts the target's localization uncertainty with the help of a trained,
complex state-dependent sensor measurement model (which is a probabilistic
neural network in our case). Our pipeline also predicts target occlusion and
obstacle collision to remove undesirable observer states. The output of the
optimization search is an optimal observer state that minimizes target
localization uncertainty while avoiding occlusion and collision. We evaluate
the proposed method using numerical and simulated (Gazebo) experiments. Our
results show that DyFOS is almost 100x faster than yet as good as brute force.
Furthermore, DyFOS yielded lower localization errors than random and heuristic
searches.

noise. Persistence effects from charge trapping are well fit by an exponential
function with short characteristic timescales, settling on the order of 5-15
minutes. The short wavelength defocused photometry is also uniquely well suited
to measure the realtime wavefront error of JWST. Analysis of the images and
reconstructed wavefront maps indicate that two different hexagonal primary
mirror segments exhibited ""tilt events"" where they changed orientation rapidly
in less than ~1.4 seconds. In some cases, the magnitude and timing of the flux
jumps caused by tilt events can be accurately predicted with a telescope model.
These tilt events can be sensed by simultaneous longer-wavelength NIRCam grism
spectral images alone in the form of changes to the point spread function,
diagnosed from the FWHM. They can also be sensed with the FGS instrument from
difference images. Tilt events possibly from sudden releases of stress in the
backplane structure behind the mirrors were expected during the commissioning

signs of decreasing in frequency but have not disappeared completely. The
detectors exhibit some minor (less than 1%) deviations from linear behavior in
the first few groups of each integration, potentially impacting absolute fluxes
and transit depths on bright targets where only a handful of groups are

EXPASS can be used with any existing GNN architecture and subgraph-optimizing

alleviates the oversmoothing problem in GNNs by slowing the layer wise loss of

Tauri stars from eleven star-forming regions, ranging from $\sim$0.5 to 10 Myr
old. The disk masses we infer from our SED models are typically greater than
those reported from (sub)mm surveys by a factor of 1.5-5, with the discrepancy
being generally higher for the more massive disks. Masses derived from (sub)mm
fluxes rely on the assumption that the disks are optically thin at all
millimeter wavelengths, which may cause the disk masses to be underestimated
since the observed flux is not sensitive to the whole mass in the disk; SED
models do not make this assumption and thus yield higher masses. Disks with
more absorbing material should be optically thicker at a given wavelength;
which could lead to a larger discrepancy for disks around massive stars when
the disk temperature is scaled by the stellar luminosity. We also compare the
disk masses and degree of dust settling across the different star-forming
regions and find that disks in younger regions have more massive disks than
disks in older regions, but a similar degree of dust settling. Together, these
results offer potential partial solutions to the ""missing"" mass problem: disks
around T Tauri stars may indeed have enough material to form planetary systems,
though previous studies have underestimated the mass by assuming the disks to
be optically thin; these planetary systems may also form earlier than
previously theorized since significant dust evolution (i.e., settling) is
already apparent in young disks.

pressure anisotropy ($p_{e\parallel}\gg p_{e\perp})$ develops upstream of the
EDR. Compared to previous investigations, the use of modern computer facilities
allows for simulations at the natural proton to electron mass ratio
$m_i/m_e=1836$. In this high-$m_i/m_e$-limit the electron dynamics changes
qualitatively, as the electron inflow to the EDR is enhanced and mainly driven
by the anisotropic pressure. Using a coordinate system with the $x$-direction
aligned with the reconnecting magnetic field and the $y$-direction aligned with
the central current layer, it is well-known that for the much studied 2D
laminar anti-parallel and symmetric scenario the reconnection electric field at
the $X$-line must be balanced by the $\partial p_{exy}/ \partial x$ and
$\partial p_{eyz}/ \partial z$ off-diagonal electron pressure stress
components. We find that the electron anisotropy upstream of the EDR imposes
large values of $\partial p_{exy}/ \partial x$ within the EDR, and along the
direction of the reconnection $X$-line this stress cancels with the stress of a
previously determined theoretical form for $\partial p_{eyz}/ \partial z$. The
electron frozen-in law is instead broken by pressure tensor gradients related
to the direct heating of the electrons by the reconnection electric field. The
reconnection rate is free to adjust to the value imposed externally by the
plasma dynamics at larger scales.

major veins and grows minor veins to refine twisty parts, which makes it

share the same growth mode, which avoids modeling them separately and ensures
model simplicity. Considering the superiorities above, we propose VeinMask to

utilizing the surroundings of each pixel. Additionally, a Residual IoU (R-IoU)

poorly understood, mass-loss phenomena that (1-8) Msun stars undergo during
their death throes as they evolve into white dwarfs (WDs). From an analysis of
JWST multiwavelength (0.9-18 micron) imaging of NGC3132, we report the
discovery of an asymmetrical dust cloud around the WD central star (CS) of
NGC3132, seen most prominently in the 18 micron~image, with a
surface-brightness limited radial extent of >~2 arcsec. We show that the A2V
star located 1.7 arcsec to CS's North-East (and 0.75 kpc from Earth) is
gravitationally-bound to the latter, by the detection of relative orbital
angular motion of (0.24+/-0.045) deg between these stars over ~20 yr. Using
aperture photometry of the CS extracted from the JWST images, together with
published optical photometry and an archival UV spectrum, we have constructed
the spectral-energy distribution (SED) of the CS and its extended emission over
the UV to mid-IR (0.091-18 micron) range. We find that fitting the SED of the
CS and the radial intensity distributions at 7.7, 12.8 and 18 micron with
thermal emission from dust requires a cloud that extends to a radius of >~1785
au, with a dust mass of ~1.3 x 10^(-2) M(Earth) and grains that are 70%
silicate and 30% amorphous carbon. We propose plausible origins of the dust
cloud and an evolutionary scenario in which a system of three stars -- the CS,
a close low-mass companion, and a more distant A2V star -- forms a stable
hierarchical triple system on the main-sequence but becomes dynamically
unstable later, resulting in the spectacular mass-ejections that form the
current, multipolar PN.

emerged as mainstream paradigms in PSP. Despite the fruitful progress, the PSP
community needs a systematic and up-to-date survey to help bridge the gap
between LMs in the natural language processing (NLP) and PSP domains and
introduce their methodologies, advancements and practical applications. To this
end, in this paper, we first introduce the similarities between protein and
human languages that allow LMs extended to pLMs, and applied to protein
databases. Then, we systematically review recent advances in LMs and pLMs from
the perspectives of network architectures, pre-training strategies,
applications, and commonly-used protein databases. Next, different types of
methods for PSP are discussed, particularly how the pLM-based architectures
function in the process of protein folding. Finally, we identify challenges
faced by the PSP community and foresee promising research directions along with
the advances of pLMs. This survey aims to be a hands-on guide for researchers
to understand PSP methods, develop pLMs and tackle challenging problems in this

the promising directions for resolving many puzzles beyond the Standard Model

the two-Higgs-doublet model with an additional real or complex Higgs triplet
scalar. By noting that the SM gauge symmetries $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ are
recovered at high energies, we can classify the two-body scattering states by
decomposing the direct product of two scalar multiplets into their direct sum
of irreducible representations of electroweak gauge groups. In such state
bases, the s-wave amplitudes of two-body scalar scatterings can be written in
the form of block-diagonalized scattering matrices. Then the application of the
perturbative unitarity conditions on the eigenvalues of scattering matrices
leads to the analytic constraints on the model parameters. Finally, we
numerically investigated several specific models, finding that the perturbative
unitarity places stringent bounds on the extra scalar mass spectrum, especially
when there exist significant mixings among scalars in the extended Higgs

dust-obscured galaxies (BluDOGs) identified by Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam.
BluDOGs are a sub-class of dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs, defined with the
extremely red color $(i-[22])_{\rm AB} \geq 7.0$; Toba et al. 2015), showing a
significant flux excess in the optical $g$- and $r$-bands over the power-law
fits to the fluxes at the longer wavelengths. Noboriguchi et al. (2019) has
suggested that BluDOGs may correspond to the blowing-out phase involved in a
gas-rich major merger scenario. However the detailed properties of BluDOGs are
not understood because of the lack of spectroscopic information. In this work,
we carry out deep optical spectroscopic observations of four BluDOGs using
Subaru/FOCAS and VLT/FORS2. The obtained spectra show broad emission lines with
extremely large equivalent widths, and a blue wing in the CIV line profile. The
redshifts are between 2.2 and 3.3. The averaged rest-frame equivalent widths of
the CIV lines are $160\pm33$ $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$, $\sim$7 times higher than
the average of a typical type-1 quasar. The FWHMs of their velocity profiles
are between 1990 and 4470 ${\rm km\ s^{-1}}$, and their asymmetric parameters
are 0.05 and 0.25. Such strong CIV lines significantly affect the broad-band
magnitudes, which is partly the origin of the blue excess seen in the spectral
energy distribution of BluDOGs. Their estimated supermassive black hole masses
are $1.1\times10^8 < M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot < 5.5 \times 10^8$. The inferred
Eddington ratios of the BluDOGs are higher than 1 ($1.1< \lambda_{\rm Edd} <
3.8$), suggesting that the BluDOGs are in a rapidly evolving phase of
supermassive black holes.

tensor contraction path optimizations and a fused Einsum mapping strategy to

To create a path, Tor authorities generate a probability distribution over
relays based on the estimates of the capacities of the relays. An incoming user
will then sample this probability distribution and choose three relays for
their paths. The estimates are based on the bandwidths of observation probes
the authority assigns to each relay in the network. Thus, in order to achieve
better load balancing between users, accurate estimates are necessary.
Unfortunately, the currently implemented estimation algorithm generate
inaccurate estimates causing the network to be under utilized and its
capacities unfairly distributed between the users paths. We propose DiProber, a
new relay capacity estimation algorithm. The algorithm proposes a new

categorize the rest samples, many of these unlabeled data may also be the
positive samples. Research on this topic is particularly useful and essential
to many real-world tasks which demand very expensive labelling cost. For
example, the recognition tasks in disease diagnosis, recommendation system and
satellite image recognition may only have few positive samples that can be
annotated by the experts. These methods mainly omit the intrinsic hardness of
some unlabeled data, which can result in sub-optimal performance as a

distribution to a normal distribution. Such flows are a common technique used
for data generation and density estimation in machine learning and data
science. The density estimate obtained with a NF requires a change of variables
formula that involves the computation of the Jacobian determinant of the NF
transformation. In order to tractably compute this determinant, continuous
normalizing flows (CNF) estimate the mapping and its Jacobian determinant using
a neural ODE. Optimal transport (OT) theory has been successfully used to
assist in finding CNFs by formulating them as OT problems with a soft penalty
for enforcing the standard normal distribution as a target measure. A drawback
of OT-based CNFs is the addition of a hyperparameter, $\alpha$, that controls
the strength of the soft penalty and requires significant tuning. We present
JKO-Flow, an algorithm to solve OT-based CNF without the need of tuning
$\alpha$. This is achieved by integrating the OT CNF framework into a
Wasserstein gradient flow framework, also known as the JKO scheme. Instead of
tuning $\alpha$, we repeatedly solve the optimization problem for a fixed
$\alpha$ effectively performing a JKO update with a time-step $\alpha$. Hence
we obtain a ""divide and conquer"" algorithm by repeatedly solving simpler

approximately 1 $\mu_{\rm B}$ per the uranium site, assuming a uniform moment
on all the sites. A ferromagnetic phase transition occurs at $T_{\rm C}=48$ K,
where the in-plane magnetization increases sharply, whereas the out-of-plane
component does not increase significantly. With decreasing temperature further
below $T_{\rm C}$ under field-cooling conditions, the out-of-plane component
increases rapidly around $T^{\star}=26$ K. In contrast, the in-plane component
hardly changes at $T^{\star}$. Specific heat measurement indicates no
$\lambda$-type anomaly around $T^{\star}$, so this is a cross-over suggesting a
reorientation of the ordering moments or successive magnetic ordering on the
part of the multiple uranium sites.

due to its inherent ambiguity: An image often exhibits various situations, and
a caption can be coupled with diverse images. Set-based embedding has been
studied as a solution to this problem. It seeks to encode a sample into a set
of different embedding vectors that capture different semantics of the sample.
In this paper, we present a novel set-based embedding method, which is distinct
from previous work in two aspects. First, we present a new similarity function
called smooth-Chamfer similarity, which is designed to alleviate the side
effects of existing similarity functions for set-based embedding. Second, we
propose a novel set prediction module to produce a set of embedding vectors
that effectively captures diverse semantics of input by the slot attention

different visual backbones, where it outperforms existing methods including

of model parameters tuned for excitation energies and molecular

functional theory simulations. In particular, the facile computation of the
polarizability, a second-order derivative, via auto-differentiation shows the
potential of differentiable programming to bypass the need for numeric
differentiation or derivation of analytical expressions. Finally, we employ
gradient-based optimization of atom identity for inverse design of organic
electronic materials with targeted orbital energy gaps and polarizabilities.
Optimized structures are obtained after as little as 15 iterations, using

field of speech enhancement, most existing methods are developed following
either empirical or relatively blind criteria, lacking adequate guidelines in

framework for both single- and multi-channel speech enhancement tasks.
Concretely, we formulate the complex spectrum recovery into the spectral
magnitude mapping in the neighborhood space of the noisy mixture, in which an
unknown sparse term is introduced and applied for phase modification in
advance. Based on that, the mapping function is decomposed into the
superimposition of the 0th-order and high-order polynomials in Taylor's series,
where the former coarsely removes the interference in the magnitude domain and
the latter progressively complements the remaining spectral detail in the
complex spectrum domain. In addition, we study the relation between adjacent
order terms and reveal that each high-order term can be recursively estimated
with its lower-order term, and each high-order term is then proposed to
evaluate using a surrogate function with trainable weights so that the whole
system can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Given that the proposed
framework is devised based on Taylor's theorem, it possesses improved internal
flexibility. Extensive experiments are conducted on WSJ0-SI84, DNS-Challenge,
Voicebank+Demand, spatialized Librispeech, and L3DAS22 multi-channel speech

linear relationship with decreasing temperature, which is ascribed to a
pseudogap in the spin excitation spectrum, pointing towards the material being
an unconventional metal. Upon further cooling, K decreases more steeply below
$T_\text{CDW1}$, indicative of the partial Fermi surface gap opening on top of

the satellite lines at $T_\text{CDW1}$ observed for $H\parallel c$, whose
temperature dependence behaves as the BCS order parameter in the weak-coupling

most of its results from the mathematical properties of the solution of a
certain partial differential equation derived from assumptions that apparently
represent conservation of momentum but are not a rigorous application of the
relevant physics. The present model is based on the scaling properties of the
standard equations of motion, which lead to mathematical results identical with

model is also kinematic like the GV model but it incorporates additional
insights borrowed from other physical theories, models and experiments. Third,

of a nonzero thickness of the dense plasma sheath. The present model
incorporates both these features in its kinematic structure. Fourth, the unlike

of pinch density to fill density, the general appearance of the umbrella like

Specifically, LAM presents a hierarchical importance map where the most

years, aiming to ensure the reliability and safety of deep neural networks

notice a discrepancy between the conventional evaluation vs. the essential
purpose of OOD detection. On the one hand, the conventional evaluation
exclusively considers risks caused by label-space distribution shifts while
ignoring the risks from input-space distribution shifts. On the other hand, the
conventional evaluation reward detection methods for not rejecting the
misclassified image in the validation dataset. However, the misclassified image
can also cause risks and should be rejected. We appeal to rethink OOD detection
from a human-centric perspective, that a proper detection method should reject
the case that the deep model's prediction mismatches the human expectations and
adopt the case that the deep model's prediction meets the human expectations.
We propose a human-centric evaluation and conduct extensive experiments on 45

method can achieve comparable and even better performance than the recently
proposed methods, which means that the development in OOD detection in the past
years may be overestimated. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that
model selection is non-trivial for OOD detection and should be considered as an

misaligned semantic information and 3D localization, hence resulting in feature
smearing and suboptimal predictions. To mitigate this issue, we propose ADD, an
Attention-based Depth knowledge Distillation framework with 3D-aware positional
encoding. Unlike previous knowledge distillation frameworks that adopt stereo-

the student but with extra ground-truth depth as input. Credit to our teacher
design, our framework is seamless, domain-gap free, easily implementable, and

Learning (CL), wherein data of new tasks arrive in incoming streams and online
learning models need to handle incoming data streams without revisiting
previous ones. Existing works used a single centroid adapted with incoming data
streams to characterize a class. This approach possibly exposes limitations
when the incoming data stream of a class is naturally multimodal. To address
this issue, in this work, we first propose an online mixture model learning
approach based on nice properties of the mature optimal transport theory
(OT-MM). Specifically, the centroids and covariance matrices of the mixture
model are adapted incrementally according to incoming data streams. The
advantages are two-fold: (i) we can characterize more accurately complex data
streams and (ii) by using centroids for each class produced by OT-MM, we can
estimate the similarity of an unseen example to each class more reasonably when
doing inference. Moreover, to combat the catastrophic forgetting in the CIL
scenario, we further propose Dynamic Preservation. Particularly, after
performing the dynamic preservation technique across data streams, the latent
representations of the classes in the old and new tasks become more condensed
themselves and more separate from each other. Together with a contraction
feature extractor, this technique facilitates the model in mitigating the
catastrophic forgetting. The experimental results on real-world datasets show
that our proposed method can significantly outperform the current
state-of-the-art baselines.

galaxy at a $z=0.214(1)$. This redshift is much lower than what would be
expected for a source dispersion measure (DM) of 729 pc cm$^{-3}$, given

Optical observations reveal the host to be a dwarf galaxy with little on-going

proposed to build generalized image processing models based on single sample.
Constraining on the sample size, multi-scale GANs have much difficulty
converging to the global optimum, which ultimately leads to limitations in
their capabilities. In this paper, we pioneered the introduction of PAC-Bayes
generalized bound theory into the training analysis of specific models under
different adversarial training methods, which can obtain a non-vacuous upper
bound on the generalization error for the specified multi-scale GAN structure.
Based on the drastic changes we found of the generalization error bound under
different adversarial attacks and different training states, we proposed an
adaptive training method which can greatly improve the image manipulation
ability of multi-scale GANs. The final experimental results show that our
adaptive training method in this paper has greatly contributed to the
improvement of the quality of the images generated by multi-scale GANs on
several image manipulation tasks. In particular, for the image super-resolution
restoration task, the multi-scale GAN model trained by the proposed method
achieves a 100% reduction in natural image quality evaluator (NIQE) and a 60%
reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE), which is better than many models

white dwarfs. They are thought to be originated from tidally disrupted
exoplanetary bodies and responsible for metal accretion onto host WDs. To
explain (1) the observationally inferred accretion rate higher than that
induced by Poynting-Robertson drag, $\dot{M}_{\rm PR}$, and (2) refractory-rich
photosphere composition indicating the accretion of terrestrial rocky
materials, previous studies proposed runaway accretion of silicate particles
due to gas drag by the increasing silicate vapor produced by the sublimation of
the particles. Because re-condensation of the vapor diffused beyond the
sublimation line was neglected, we revisit this problem by one-dimensional
advection/diffusion simulation that consistently incorporates silicate
sublimation/condensation and back-reaction to particle drift due to gas drag in
the solid-rich disc. We find that the silicate vapor density in the region
overlapping the solid particles follows the saturating vapor pressure and that
no runaway accretion occurs if the re-condensation is included. This always
limits the accretion rate from mono-compositional silicate discs to
$\dot{M}_{\rm PR}$ in the equilibrium state. Alternatively, by performing
additional simulations that couple the volatile gas (e.g., water vapor), we
demonstrate that the volatile gas enhances the silicate accretion to
$>\dot{M}_{\rm PR}$ through gas drag. The refractory-rich accretion is
simultaneously reproduced when the initial volatile fraction of disc is
$\lesssim 10$ wt\% because of the suppression of volatile accretion due to the
efficient back-reaction of solid to gas. The discs originating from C-type
asteroid analogs might be a possible clue to the high-$\dot{M}$ puzzle.

geometric ambiguity present in drawings. To tackle this, we present Dr.3D, a
novel adaptation approach that adapts an existing 3D GAN to artistic drawings.
Dr.3D is equipped with three novel components to handle the geometric
ambiguity: a deformation-aware 3D synthesis network, an alternating adaptation
of pose estimation and image synthesis, and geometric priors. Experiments show
that our approach can successfully adapt 3D GANs to drawings and enable

  Reconstruction","Code: see https://github.com/IceTTTb/NopeSAC",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper studies the challenging two-view 3D reconstruction in a rigorous
sparse-view configuration, which is suffering from insufficient correspondences
in the input image pairs for camera pose estimation. We present a novel Neural
One-PlanE RANSAC framework (termed NOPE-SAC in short) that exerts excellent
capability to learn one-plane pose hypotheses from 3D plane correspondences.
Building on the top of a siamese plane detection network, our NOPE-SAC first
generates putative plane correspondences with a coarse initial pose. It then
feeds the learned 3D plane parameters of correspondences into shared MLPs to
estimate the one-plane camera pose hypotheses, which are subsequently reweighed
in a RANSAC manner to obtain the final camera pose. Because the neural
one-plane pose minimizes the number of plane correspondences for adaptive pose
hypotheses generation, it enables stable pose voting and reliable pose
refinement in a few plane correspondences for the sparse-view inputs. In the
experiments, we demonstrate that our NOPE-SAC significantly improves the camera
pose estimation for the two-view inputs with severe viewpoint changes, setting
several new state-of-the-art performances on two challenging benchmarks, i.e.,
MatterPort3D and ScanNet, for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. The source code is

higher-order weak couplings with respect to the two-body decay. We show that
this does not always hold when a heavy particle is produced by forbidden decay
in a thermal plasma, where the scattering shares the same order of couplings
with the decay. We find that there is a simple and close relation between the
forbidden decay and the same-order scattering. To illustrate this point, we
consider freeze-in production of heavy dark matter via a light scalar mediator.
We point out that, when the Boltzmann (quantum) statistics is used, the
forbidden decay can contribute to the dark matter relic density at 5$\%$-24$\%$
(11$\%$-42$\%$) with a weak thermal coupling, while the contribution from the
scattering channel can be several orders of magnitude larger than from the
forbidden decay if the thermal coupling is much smaller. Such a relative effect
between the scattering and the forbidden decay could also exist in other
plasma-induced processes, such as the purely thermal generation of the
right-handed neutrino dark matter, or of the lepton asymmetry in leptogenesis.

human-made and natural systems, from the exploitation of geo-resources to the
understanding of earthquakes. Recent studies have shed light on how aseismic
slip propagates in response to continuous fluid injections. Yet much less is
known about the response of faults after the injection of fluids has stopped.
In this work, we investigate via an hydro-mechanical model the propagation and
ultimate arrest of aseismic slip during the so-called post-injection stage. We
show that after shut-in, fault slip propagates in pulse-like mode. The
conditions that control the propagation as a pulse and notably when and where
the ruptures arrest are fully established. In particular, critically-stressed
faults can host rupture pulses that propagate for several orders of magnitude
the injection duration and reach up to nearly double the size of the ruptures
at the moment of shut-in. We consequently argue that the persistent stressing
of increasingly larger rock volumes caused by post-injection aseismic slip is a
plausible mechanism for the triggering of post-injection seismicity -- a
critical issue in the geo-energy industry. We discuss evidence that supports
this mechanism based on documented cases of post-injection-induced seismicity.

reasons-scalability is a common issue owing to large-sized networks, and the
generated adversarial inputs often lack important qualities such as naturalness
and output-impartiality. We relate this problem to the task of patching neural

to produce an adversarial input because the effect of changing the weights can
also be brought about by changing the inputs instead. This work presents a
novel technique to patch neural networks and an innovative approach of using it

  Modelling Inferences with Multiple Antecedents and Varying Likelihoods",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Commonsense knowledge-graphs (CKGs) are important resources towards building
machines that can 'reason' on text or environmental inputs and make inferences
beyond perception. While current CKGs encode world knowledge for a large number
of concepts and have been effectively utilized for incorporating commonsense in
neural models, they primarily encode declarative or single-condition
inferential knowledge and assume all conceptual beliefs to have the same
likelihood. Further, these CKGs utilize a limited set of relations shared
across concepts and lack a coherent knowledge organization structure resulting
in redundancies as well as sparsity across the larger knowledge graph.
Consequently, today's CKGs, while useful for a first level of reasoning, do not
adequately capture deeper human-level commonsense inferences which can be more
nuanced and influenced by multiple contextual or situational factors.
  Accordingly, in this work, we study how commonsense knowledge can be better
represented by -- (i) utilizing a probabilistic logic representation scheme to
model composite inferential knowledge and represent conceptual beliefs with
varying likelihoods and (ii) incorporating a hierarchical conceptual ontology
to identify salient concept-relevant relations and organize beliefs at
different conceptual levels. Our resulting knowledge representation framework
can encode a wider variety of world knowledge and represent beliefs flexibly
using grounded concepts as well as free-text phrases. As a result, the
framework can be utilized as both a traditional free-text knowledge graph and a
grounded logic-based inference system more suitable for neuro-symbolic
applications. We describe how we extend the PrimeNet knowledge base with our
framework through crowd-sourcing and expert-annotation, and demonstrate its
application for more interpretable passage-based semantic parsing and question

grow from micron size particles to planets is not well understood. The key is
to search for evidence of dust accumulation and growth as a function of radius
in the disk. We investigate the radial profile of grain size in the DS Tau disk
by fitting multi-band ALMA observations with self-consistent radiative transfer
models. The best-fit grain sizes range from centimeters in the inner disk down
to 30 micron in the outer regions. Such an inside-out decreasing tendency is
consistent with theories of dust evolution. Based on the best-fit model, we
find that dust of 2 Jupiter masses has been depleted within the gap. By taking
the gas-to-dust mass ratio into account, the lost mass is enough to form the
3.5 Jupiter mass planet inferred by literature hydrodynamic simulations.
Moreover, our modeling also indicates that at the interface region between the
gap and the ring, the grain size profile shows a discontinuity, with its
amplitude dependent on the dust model adopted in the radiative transfer
analysis. Future multi-wavelength observations at higher angular resolutions
are required to better constrain the grain size and its variation in the
vicinity of disk substructures.

Task 1, the automatic segmentation task, our approach was, in contrast to
earlier solutions using 3D segmentation, to keep it as simple as possible using
a 2D model, analyzing every slice as a standalone image. In addition, we were
interested in understanding how different modalities influence the results. We
proposed two approaches; one using only the CT scans to make predictions and
another using a combination of the CT and PET scans. For Task 2, the prediction
of recurrence-free survival, we first proposed two approaches, one where we
only use patient data and one where we combined the patient data with
segmentations from the image model. For the prediction of the first two
approaches, we used Random Forest. In our third approach, we combined patient
data and image data using XGBoost. Low kidney function might worsen cancer
prognosis. In this approach, we therefore estimated the kidney function of the
patients and included it as a feature. Overall, we conclude that our simple
methods were not able to compete with the highest-ranking submissions, but we
still obtained reasonably good scores. We also got interesting insights into
how the combination of different modalities can influence the segmentation and
predictions.

optimization tasks efficiently. The use of these algorithms highly depends on
the feedback signals provided by the environment in charge of informing about
how good (or bad) the decisions made by the learned agent are. Unfortunately,
in a broad range of problems the design of a good reward function is not
trivial, so in such cases sparse reward signals are instead adopted. The lack
of a dense reward function poses new challenges, mostly related to exploration.
Imitation Learning has addressed those problems by leveraging demonstrations
from experts. In the absence of an expert (and its subsequent demonstrations),
an option is to prioritize well-suited exploration experiences collected by the
agent in order to bootstrap its learning process with good exploration
behaviors. However, this solution highly depends on the ability of the agent to
discover such trajectories in the early stages of its learning process. To
tackle this issue, we propose to combine imitation learning with intrinsic
motivation, two of the most widely adopted techniques to address problems with
sparse reward. In this work intrinsic motivation is used to encourage the agent
to explore the environment based on its curiosity, whereas imitation learning
allows repeating the most promising experiences to accelerate the learning
process. This combination is shown to yield an improved performance and better
generalization in procedurally-generated environments, outperforming previously
reported self-imitation learning methods and achieving equal or better sample
efficiency with respect to intrinsic motivation in isolation.

Existing methods take the patches cropped from sketches as the graph nodes, and
construct the edges based on sketch's drawing order or Euclidean distances on
the canvas. However, the drawing order of a sketch may not be unique, while the
patches from semantically related parts of a sketch may be far away from each
other on the canvas. In this paper, we propose an order-invariant,
semantics-aware method for graphic sketch representations. The cropped sketch
patches are linked according to their global semantics or local geometric
shapes, namely the synonymous proximity, by computing the cosine similarity
between the captured patch embeddings. Such constructed edges are learnable to
adapt to the variation of sketch drawings, which enable the message passing
among synonymous patches. Aggregating the messages from synonymous patches by
graph convolutional networks plays a role of denoising, which is beneficial to
produce robust patch embeddings and accurate sketch representations.
Furthermore, we enforce a clustering constraint over the embeddings jointly
with the network learning. The synonymous patches are self-organized as compact
clusters, and their embeddings are guided to move towards their assigned
cluster centroids. It raises the accuracy of the computed synonymous proximity.
Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the
performance on both controllable sketch synthesis and sketch healing.

long-term RES prediction involves significant errors, we need online configure
the frequency control parameters of RESs in a rolling manner to improve the
operation economics under the premise of stabilizing system frequency. To
address this concern, this paper proposes a frequency constrained stochastic
look-ahead power dispatch (FCS-LAPD) model to formulate the frequency control
parameters of RESs and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) as scheduling variables,
which can optimally allocate the virtual inertia and droop coefficient of RESs
and ESSs. In this FCS-LAPD model, the uncertainties of RESs are characterized
using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The required reserves are determined by
frequency control parameters, and the reserve cost coefficients are adjusted
properly to allocate the reserves according to the predicted power generation.
Due to the nonlinearity of the frequency nadir constraint, a convex hull
approximation method is proposed to linearize it with guaranteed feasibility.
The proposed FCS-LAPD is ultimately cast as an instance of quadratic
programming and can be efficiently solved. Case studies on modified IEEE 24-bus
system and a provincial power system in China are conducted to show the
effectiveness of the proposed model.

weighted ensemble of its neighbours' predictions, with weights determined
according to their similarities in the feature space. In addition, we consider
the clustering-based unsupervised person ReID as a label-noise learning

reduce model susceptibility to over-fitting while improving the training

Aiming at efficient TomoSAR imaging, this paper proposes a novel efficient

Adaptive Threshold ALISTA-based Sparse Imaging Network (ATASI-Net). The weight
matrix in each layer of ATASI-Net is pre-computed as the solution of an

adaptive threshold is introduced for each azimuth-range pixel, enabling the
threshold shrinkage to be not only layer-varied but also element-wise.
Moreover, the final learned thresholds can be visualized and combined with the
SAR image semantics for mutual feedback. Finally, extensive experiments on
simulated and real data are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and

we can quickly find occurrences of $P_1$ and $P_2$ in $S$ with distance in

there exist $a \in S_i$ and $b \in S_j$ with $a+s = b$. We start by showing
that the Shifted Set Intersection problem is equivalent to the indexing variant
of 3SUM (3SUM Indexing) [Golovnev et al., STOC 2020]. Via several steps of
reduction we then show that the Gapped String Indexing problem reduces to

clumpiness and activity of lower mass stars may determine the structure and

implicit function to learn an angle field around the normal of each point in

Instead of directly predicting the normal of an input point, we predict the
angle offset between the ground truth normal and a randomly sampled query
normal. This strategy pushes the network to observe more diverse samples, which
leads to higher prediction accuracy in a more robust manner. To predict normals
from the learned angle fields at inference time, we randomly sample query
vectors in a unit spherical space and take the vectors with minimal angle
values as the predicted normals. To further leverage the prior learned by NeAF,
we propose to refine the predicted normal vectors by minimizing the angle
offsets. The experimental results with synthetic data and real scans show

nitrogen chemistry can be far from thermochemical equilibrium in warm
atmospheres, we extensively investigate under what conditions, and with what
assumptions, the observable NH3 abundances can diagnose an atmosphere's bulk
nitrogen abundance. In the first paper of this series, we investigate
atmospheric T-P profiles across equilibrium temperature, surface gravity,
intrinsic temperature, atmospheric metallicity, and C/O ratio using a 1D
radiative-convective equilibrium model. Models with the same intrinsic
temperature and surface gravity coincide with a shared ""universal"" adiabat in
the deep atmosphere, across a wide equilibrium temperature range (250--1200 K),
which is not seen in hotter or cooler models. We explain this behavior in terms
of the classic ""radiative zero solution"" and then establish a semi-analytical
T-P profile of the deep atmospheres of warm exoplanets. This profile is then
used to predict vertically quenched NH3 abundances. At solar metallicity, our
results show that the quenched NH3 abundance only coincides with the bulk
nitrogen abundance (within 10%) at low intrinsic temperature, corresponding to
a planet with a sub-Jupiter mass (< 1 MJ) and old age (> 1 Gyr). If a planet
has a high metallicity ($\ge$ 10$\times$ solar) atmosphere, the quenched NH3
abundance significantly underestimates the bulk nitrogen abundance at almost

equilibrium temperature, mass, age, eddy diffusion coefficient, atmospheric
composition, and stellar spectral type. We confirm that the quenched NH3
abundance coincides with the bulk nitrogen abundance only at sub-Jupiter mass
(< 1MJ) planets and old ages (> 1 Gyr) for solar composition atmospheres,
highlighting important caveats for inferring atmospheric nitrogen abundances.
Our semi-analytical model reproduces the quenched NH3 abundance computed by
VULCAN and thus helps to infer the bulk nitrogen abundance from a retrieved NH3
abundance. By computing transmission and emission spectra, we predict that the
equilibrium temperature range of 400--1000 K is optimal for detecting NH3
because NH3 depletion by thermochemistry and photochemistry is significant at
hotter planets whereas entire spectral features become weak at colder planets.
For Jupiter-mass planets around Sun-like stars in this temperature range, NH3
leaves observable signatures of $\sim$ 50 ppm at 1.5, 2.1, and 11 $\rm {\mu}m$
in transmission spectra and > 300--100 ppm at 6 $\rm {\mu}m$ and 11 $\rm
{\mu}m$ in emission spectra. The photodissociation of NH3 leads HCN to replace
NH3 at low pressures. However, the low HCN column densities lead to much weaker
absorption features than for NH3. The NH3 features are readily accessible to
JWST observations to constrain atmospheric nitrogen abundances, which may open
a new avenue to understand the formation processes of giant exoplanets.

MVRackLay shows superior performance vis-a-vis its single view counterpart,
RackLay, in layout accuracy, quantized in terms of the mean IoU and mAP

does not use the predictions of the base models as inputs to a machine learning

ensembling of the base learners that linearly combines the base predictions,
which are convex combinations where the components of the ensembling vector are
all nonnegative and sum up to 1; affine combinations where the weight vector
components are required to sum up to 1; and the unconstrained combinations
where the components are free to take any real value. The constraints are both
theoretically analyzed under known statistics and integrated into the learning

from calibration for probabilistic predictors. While the notion of perfect
calibration is well-understood, there is no consensus on how to quantify the

proposed in the literature, but it is unclear how they compare to each other,
and many popular measures such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) fail to
satisfy basic properties like continuity.
  We present a rigorous framework for analyzing calibration measures, inspired
by the literature on property testing. We propose a ground-truth notion of
distance from calibration: the $\ell_1$ distance to the nearest perfectly
calibrated predictor. We define a consistent calibration measure as one that is
polynomially related to this distance. Applying our framework, we identify
three calibration measures that are consistent and can be estimated
efficiently: smooth calibration, interval calibration, and Laplace kernel
calibration. The former two give quadratic approximations to the ground truth
distance, which we show is information-theoretically optimal in a natural model
for measuring calibration which we term the prediction-only access model. Our
work thus establishes fundamental lower and upper bounds on measuring the
distance to calibration, and also provides theoretical justification for
preferring certain metrics (like Laplace kernel calibration) in practice.

tabular feature interaction still remains an open problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel Graph Estimator, which automatically estimates the relations
among tabular features and builds graphs by assigning edges between related
features. Such relation graphs organize independent tabular features into a
kind of graph data such that interaction of nodes (tabular features) can be
conducted in an orderly fashion. Based on our proposed Graph Estimator, we
present a bespoke Transformer network tailored for tabular learning, called
T2G-Former, which processes tabular data by performing tabular feature
interaction guided by the relation graphs. A specific Cross-level Readout
collects salient features predicted by the layers in T2G-Former across
different levels, and attains global semantics for final prediction.
Comprehensive experiments show that our T2G-Former achieves superior
performance among DNNs and is competitive with non-deep Gradient Boosted

theorem, according to which the geometry of $\Sigma_3$ is either one of the
eight geometries from the Thurston geometrization conjecture, or a combination
of Thurston geometries smoothly sewn together. We assume that topology of
individual geometries plays no observational role, i.e. the size of individual
geometries is much larger than the Hubble radius today. We investigate the
dynamics of each of the individual geometries by making use of the simplifying
assumption that our local Hubble patch consists of only one such geometry,
which is approximately homogeneous on very large scales, but spatial isotropy
is generally violated. Spatial anisotropies grow in time in decelerating
universes, but they decay in accelerating universes. The thus-created
anisotropy problem can be solved by a period of primordial inflation, akin to
how the flatness problem is solved. Therefore, as regards Universe's large
scale geometry, any of the Thurston's geometries should be considered on a par
with Friedmann's geometries. We consider two observational methods that can be

horizon geometries in $d$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell and 4-dimensional
conformal gravities is revisited using the restricted phase space formalism.
The concept of subsystems for black holes is introduced, which enables a
precise description for the thermodynamic behaviors of (non-compact) black
holes with infinitely large horizon area. The concrete behaviors can be
different for TBHs in the same underlying theory but with different horizon
geometries, or for those with the same horizon geometry but from different
underlying theories.
  In some concrete thermodynamic processes, the non-compact black holes in
4-dimensional conformal gravity can reach certain state with zero entropy but
nonvanishing temperature, which is physically unsounded. This suggests a novel
use of black hole thermodynamics as a tool for testing the viability of gravity
models or constraining the model parameters or integration constants. The high
and low temperature limits of the TBHs are also considered, and it is found
that, at high temperature, all TBHs behave like low temperature phonon gases,
while at low temperature, all charged as well as neutral hyperbolic TBHs in
Einstein-Maxwell gravity behave like strongly degenerated electron gases.
Finally, using the concept of subsystems, some conceptual issues in the
description for thermal fluctuations in black hole systems are clarified, and
the relative thermal fluctuations for finite subsystems are also analyzed in
some detail.

based on the epipolar disparity flow (E-flow), called DispMVS, which infers the
depth information from the pixel movement between two views. The core of
DispMVS is to construct a 2D cost volume on the image plane along the epipolar
line between each pair (between the reference image and several source images)
for pixel matching and fuse uncountable depths triangulated from each pair by
multi-view geometry to ensure multi-view consistency. To be robust, DispMVS
starts from a randomly initialized depth map and iteratively refines the depth
map with the help of the coarse-to-fine strategy. Experiments on DTUMVS and
Tanks\&Temple datasets show that DispMVS is not sensitive to the depth range
and achieves state-of-the-art results with lower GPU memory.

regularity of the model to approximate. This assumption is however not always
met in reality. For instance in civil or mechanical engineering, some models
may present discontinuities or non-smoothness, e.g., in case of instability

result: if $E\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is AD-regular and there exists a set of
direction $G\subset \mathbb{S}^1$ with $\mathcal{H}^1(G)\gtrsim 1$ such that
for every $\theta\in G$ we have

corollary, we obtain a result on AD-regular sets which avoid a large set of

of outliers in activations leading to a large quantization error. To adapt to
the error, one must use quantization-aware training, which entails a

those for the original model. Pretrained language models, however, often do not

arbitrary ones for fine-tuning. In that case, it is observed that
quantization-aware training overfits the model to the fine-tuning data. For

valuable solution to automatically learn efficient resource management
strategies in complex networks. In many scenarios, the learning task is
performed in the Cloud, while experience samples are generated directly by edge
nodes or users. Therefore, the learning task involves some data exchange which,
in turn, subtracts a certain amount of transmission resources from the system.
This creates a friction between the need to speed up convergence towards an
effective strategy, which requires the allocation of resources to transmit
learning samples, and the need to maximize the amount of resources used for
data plane communication, maximizing users' Quality of Service (QoS), which
requires the learning process to be efficient, i.e., minimize its overhead. In
this paper, we investigate this trade-off and propose a dynamic balancing
strategy between the learning and data planes, which allows the centralized
learning agent to quickly converge to an efficient resource allocation strategy
while minimizing the impact on QoS. Simulation results show that the proposed
method outperforms static allocation methods, converging to the optimal policy
(i.e., maximum efficacy and minimum overhead of the learning plane) in the long
run.

the narrow bandwidth, band gap, local density of states and optical
conductivity are significantly modified by the aligned hBN substrates.
Interestingly, these electronic properties can be used as a signature of the
alignment in experiment. Moreover, the TBG/hBN superlattices in the presence or
absence of the two-fold rotation symmetry response differently to the external

estimation from facial videos which gives significant convenience compared with
traditional contact-based measurements. In the real-world long-term health
monitoring scenario, the distance of the participants and their head movements
usually vary by time, resulting in the inaccurate rPPG measurement due to the
varying face resolution and complex motion artifacts. Different from the
previous rPPG models designed for a constant distance between camera and
participants, in this paper, we propose two plug-and-play blocks (i.e.,
physiological signal feature extraction block (PFE) and temporal face alignment
block (TFA)) to alleviate the degradation of changing distance and head motion.
On one side, guided with representative-area information, PFE adaptively
encodes the arbitrary resolution facial frames to the fixed-resolution facial
structure features. On the other side, leveraging the estimated optical flow,
TFA is able to counteract the rPPG signal confusion caused by the head movement
thus benefit the motion-robust rPPG signal recovery. Besides, we also train the
model with a cross-resolution constraint using a two-stream dual-resolution
framework, which further helps PFE learn resolution-robust facial rPPG
features. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (UBFC-rPPG, COHFACE

1.18"" in F154W, 1.11"" in N242W, and 1.24"" in N245M. We used SExtractor to
separately identify sources in the FUV and NUV filters and produce the UV

3D GAN inversion. Although with the facial prior preserved in pre-trained 3D

degradations. Most of the existing works design an explicit degradation
estimator for each degradation to guide SR. However, it is infeasible to
provide concrete labels of multiple degradation combinations (e.g., blur,
noise, jpeg compression) to supervise the degradation estimator training. In
addition, these special designs for certain degradation, such as blur, impedes
the models from being generalized to handle different degradations. To this
end, it is necessary to design an implicit degradation estimator that can
extract discriminative degradation representation for all degradations without
relying on the supervision of degradation ground-truth. In this paper, we
propose a Knowledge Distillation based Blind-SR network (KDSR). It consists of
a knowledge distillation based implicit degradation estimator network (KD-IDE)
and an efficient SR network. To learn the KDSR model, we first train a teacher
network: KD-IDE$_{T}$. It takes paired HR and LR patches as inputs and is
optimized with the SR network jointly. Then, we further train a student network
KD-IDE$_{S}$, which only takes LR images as input and learns to extract the
same implicit degradation representation (IDR) as KD-IDE$_{T}$. In addition, to
fully use extracted IDR, we design a simple, strong, and efficient IDR based
dynamic convolution residual block (IDR-DCRB) to build an SR network. We
conduct extensive experiments under classic and real-world degradation
settings. The results show that KDSR achieves SOTA performance and can
generalize to various degradation processes. The source codes and pre-trained

corresponding video, the length/duration of the translated speech should be as
close as possible to that of the original speech, which requires strict length
control. Previous works usually control the number of words or characters
generated by the machine translation model to be similar to the source

duration of words/characters in different languages varies. In this paper, we
propose a machine translation system tailored for the task of video dubbing,

match the length of source and target speech. Specifically, we control the
speech length of generated sentence by guiding the prediction of each word with
the duration information, including the speech duration of itself as well as
how much duration is left for the remaining words. We design experiments on
four language directions (German -> English, Spanish -> English, Chinese <->

Without
spatial resolution, it cannot be compared easily to flare emissions in other
wavelengths. The Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA) offers
sufficient resolution for the first time. However, used as an interferometer,
its field of view is smaller than an active region and ALMA cannot observe on
demand when a flare occurs. We use readily available large scale single-dish
ALMA observations of solar millimeter flares and compare them to well-known
features observed in other wavelengths. The properties of these other flare
emissions, correlating in space and time, may then be used to interpret the
millimeter brightenings and vice versa. The aim is to obtain reliable
associations, limited by the time and space resolution of single-dish
observations. We collected ALMA observations at 3 mm and 1 mm and searched for
millimeter brightenings during times given in a flare catalog. We found five
events with 9 or more images that can be used for comparison in time and space.
The millimeter brightenings are associated with a variety of flare features in
cool (H$\alpha$, 30.4 nm), intermediate (17.1 nm), and hot (9.4 nm) lines. In
several cases, the millimeter brightening peaked at the footpoint of a hot
flare loop. In other cases the peak coincided with the top or footpoint of an
active H{\alpha} filament. We found correlations also with post-flare loops and
tops of a hot loop, and in some cases to no features at all. The wide field of
view provided by the single-dish observations allowed for completely
overviewing the flare activity in millimeter waves for the first time. The
associated phenomena often changed during the flare in type and location, and
may explain the sometimes bewildering behavior of millimeter flare emissions
observed previously without spatial resolution.

those after 2014, an evolution that can be well explained by including the
effects of inverse-Comptonisation by a corona on the early-time spectra. The
corona is present when the source accretion rate is super-Eddington, while
there is no evidence for its effect in data obtained after 2014, when the mass

suffers from low adoption of smart farming tools. While AI-driven digital
agriculture tools can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, they
lack tangible quantitative evidence on their benefits to the farmers. Field
experiments can derive such evidence, but are often costly, time consuming and
hence limited in scope and scale of application. To this end, we propose an
observational causal inference framework for the empirical evaluation of the
impact of digital tools on target farm performance indicators (e.g., yield in
this case). This way, we can increase farmers' trust via enhancing the
transparency of the digital agriculture market and accelerate the adoption of
technologies that aim to secure farmer income resilience and global
agricultural sustainability. As a case study, we designed and implemented a
recommendation system for the optimal sowing time of cotton based on numerical
weather predictions, which was used by a farmers' cooperative during the
growing season of 2021. We then leverage agricultural knowledge, collected
yield data, and environmental information to develop a causal graph of the farm
system. Using the back-door criterion, we identify the impact of sowing
recommendations on the yield and subsequently estimate it using linear
regression, matching, inverse propensity score weighting and meta-learners. The
results reveal that a field sown according to our recommendations exhibited a
statistically significant yield increase that ranged from 12% to 17%, depending
on the method. The effect estimates were robust, as indicated by the agreement
among the estimation methods and four successful refutation tests. We argue
that this approach can be implemented for decision support systems of other
fields, extending their evaluation beyond a performance assessment of internal

index to each basic loop in such a category. If all Maslov indexes vanish, we
get $\mathcal{C}',\sigma'$ as the $\mathbb{Z}$-lifts of $\mathcal{C},\sigma$
respectively such that $\mathcal{C}'$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded triangulated
category and $\sigma'$ is a Bridgeland stability condition on $\mathcal{C}'$.
Moreover, we showed that there is an isomorphism
$$Stab^{0,e}(\mathcal{C})\xrightarrow{\simeq} BStab(\mathcal{C}')$$ where
$Stab^{0,e}(\mathcal{C})$ denotes the equivalence classes of stability
conditions which are deformation equivalent to $\sigma$, and
$BStab(\mathcal{C}')$ denotes the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on
$\mathcal{C}'$.
  We provide examples of stability conditions on a simple cyclic category. We
also discuss some interesting phenomena in these examples, such as the
chirality symmetry breaking phenomenon and nontrivial monodromy. The chirality
symmetry breaking phenomenon involves stability conditions which can not be
lifted to Bridgeland stability conditions.

the technological methods to realize efficient remote health monitoring,
federated learning (FL) has drawn particular attention due to its robustness in
preserving data privacy. However, FL can yield to high communication costs, due
to frequent transmissions between the FL server and clients. To tackle this
problem, we propose in this paper a communication-efficient federated learning
(CEFL) framework that involves clients clustering and transfer learning. First,
we propose to group clients through the calculation of similarity factors,
based on the neural networks characteristics. Then, a representative client in
each cluster is selected to be the leader of the cluster. Differently from the
conventional FL, our method performs FL training only among the cluster
leaders. Subsequently, transfer learning is adopted by the leader to update its
cluster members with the trained FL model. Finally, each member fine-tunes the
received model with its own data. To further reduce the communication costs, we
opt for a partial-layer FL aggregation approach. This method suggests partially
updating the neural network model rather than fully. Through experiments, we
show that CEFL can save up to to 98.45% in communication costs while conceding
less than 3% in accuracy loss, when compared to the conventional FL. Finally,
CEFL demonstrates a high accuracy for clients with small or unbalanced

thermosyphon researches for TES are related to domestic water-heating systems
of small-capacity (<100 liters) and low-temperature (<100 {\deg}C). Thus,
investigations into thermosyphon charging for high-temperature storage are
desired. This study focuses on thermosyphon-charging and storing of a
single-medium stratified TES. The experiments were conducted on a 370 liters
cylindrical storage (aspect ratio 4:1) with a heat-pipe system (3-liter volume)
acting as a collector. Dowtherm-A oil was used as the heat transfer fluid
(HTF), and the thermal expansion of HTF was accommodated in an expansion tank
via two different designs (top and bottom connections from storage tank to
expansion tank). Moreover, continuous and pulsatile charging are investigated
for low (150 {\deg}C) and high (250 and 300 {\deg}C) temperatures. The results
indicate that the maximum HTF temperature coming out of the heating pipes is
~25 {\deg}C more for the bottom-expansion design. Furthermore, it results in
higher charging efficiency than the top-expansion setup for high-temperature
studies. Finally, it is revealed that under design conditions, there are limits
on the degree of thermal stratification achieved in the charging cycle and the
maximum layover time allowable for interrupted charging. These results provide
insights into the operational strategy of thermosyphon-charging stratified

approach of directly learning the eigensapce. A severe problem of the direct
approach, applied in batch-learning, is the inconsistent mapping of features to
eigenspace coordinates in different batches. We analyze the degrees of freedom
of learning this task using batches and propose a stable alignment mechanism
that can work both with batch changes and with graph-metric changes. We show
that our learnt spectral embedding is better in terms of NMI, ACC, Grassman
distance, orthogonality and classification accuracy, compared to SOTA. In
addition, the learning is more stable.

Transformer (PAT), that is composed of the new doughnut kernel. Compared with
tokens in the NLP field, Transformer in computer vision has the problem of
handling the high resolution of pixels in images. In ViT, an image is cut into
square-shaped patches. As the follow-up of ViT, Swin Transformer proposes an
additional step of shifting to decrease the existence of fixed boundaries,
which also incurs 'two connected Swin Transformer blocks' as the minimum unit
of the model. Inheriting the patch/window idea, our doughnut kernel enhances
the design of patches further. It replaces the line-cut boundaries with two
types of areas: sensor and updating, which is based on the comprehension of
self-attention (named QKVA grid). The doughnut kernel also brings a new topic
about the shape of kernels beyond square. To verify its performance on image
classification, PAT is designed with Transformer blocks of regular octagon
shape doughnut kernels. Its architecture is lighter: the minimum pattern
attention layer is only one for each stage. Under similar complexity of
computation, its performances on ImageNet 1K reach higher throughput (+10%) and
surpass Swin Transformer (+0.8 acc1).

activities as triplets of (instrument, verb, target). Albeit providing detailed
information for computer-assisted intervention, current triplet recognition
approaches rely only on single frame features. Exploiting the temporal cues
from earlier frames would improve the recognition of surgical action triplets
from videos. In this paper, we propose Rendezvous in Time (RiT) - a deep
learning model that extends the state-of-the-art model, Rendezvous, with
temporal modeling. Focusing more on the verbs, our RiT explores the
connectedness of current and past frames to learn temporal attention-based
features for enhanced triplet recognition. We validate our proposal on the
challenging surgical triplet dataset, CholecT45, demonstrating an improved
recognition of the verb and triplet along with other interactions involving the
verb such as (instrument, verb). Qualitative results show that the RiT produces
smoother predictions for most triplet instances than the state-of-the-arts. We
present a novel attention-based approach that leverages the temporal fusion of
video frames to model the evolution of surgical actions and exploit their
benefits for surgical triplet recognition.

The performance of supervised federated learning models can benefit from
clustering. 2) It is non-trivial to extend centralized ones to perform
federated clustering tasks. In centralized settings, various deep clustering
methods that perform dimensionality reduction and clustering jointly have
achieved great success. To obtain high-quality cluster information, it is

through the elicitation of informative prior distributions. Concerns are
however often raised about the potential for prior-data conflict and the impact
of Bayes test decisions on frequentist operating characteristics, with
particular attention being assigned to inflation of type I error rates. This
motivates the development of principled borrowing mechanisms, that strike a
balance between frequentist and Bayesian decisions. Ideally, the trust assigned
to historical information defines the degree of robustness to prior-data
conflict one is willing to sacrifice. However, such relationship is often not
directly available when explicitly considering inflation of type I error rates.
We build on available literature relating frequentist and Bayesian test
decisions, and investigate a rationale for inflation of type I error rate which
explicitly and linearly relates the amount of borrowing and the amount of type
I error rate inflation in one-arm studies. A novel dynamic borrowing mechanism
tailored to hypothesis testing is additionally proposed. We show that, while
dynamic borrowing prevents the possibility to obtain a simple closed form type
I error rate computation, an explicit upper bound can still be enforced.
Connections with the robust mixture prior approach, particularly in relation to
the choice of the mixture weight and robust component, are made. Simulations
are performed to show the properties of the approach for normal and binomial

superfluid to the topological superfluid happens under proper Zeeman field
strength and SOC strength. In particular, in contrast to the BCS superfluid
decreasing monotonically as the SOC strength increasing, the topological
superfluid region shows a dome with the SOC strength increasing. An optimal
region in the phase diagram to find the topological superfluid can be found,
which is important to realize the topological superfluid in optical lattice
experimentally. Then we obtain the change of both band structure and density of

peaks of DOS in the topological superfluid by the topology change of the
low-energy branch of quasiparticle energy spectra. Moreover, the topological

percent by applying in-plane strain, i.e., without generating high pressure in
the bulk. In this work, we study the strain-induced Mott transition on a
honeycomb lattice by using computationally inexpensive techniques, including
Gutzwiller Wave Function (GWF) and different variants of Gutzwiller
Approximation (GA), obtaining the lower and upper bounds for critical Hubbard
repulsion ($U$) of electrons. For uniaxial strain in the armchair direction the
band gap is absent, and electron correlations play a dominant role. A
significant reduction of the critical Hubbard $U$ is predicted. Model
considerations are mapped onto tight-binding Hamiltonian for monolayer graphene
by the auxiliary Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for acoustic phonons, assuming zero
stress in the direction perpendicular to the strain applied. Our results
suggest that graphene, although staying in semimetallic phase even for
extremely high uniaxial strains, may show measurable signatures of electron

cryptographic tools can efficiently constrain actions of untrusted quantum
devices. Recently, Brakerski et al. at FOCS 2018 showed a remarkable use of
NTCF for a classically verifiable proof of quantumness and also derived a
protocol for cryptographically certifiable quantum randomness generation.
However, the original NTCF used in their work is essentially 2-to-1 one-way
function, namely NTCF$^1_2$, which greatly limits the rate of randomness
generation.
  In this work, we attempt to further extend the NTCF$^1_2$ to achieve a
$\kappa$-to-1 function with poly-bounded preimage size. Specifically, we focus
on a significant extrapolation of NTCF$^1_2$ by drawing on extrapolated
dihedral cosets, giving a model of NTCF$^1_{\kappa}$ with $\kappa = poly(n)$.
Then, we present an efficient construction of NTCF$^1_{\kappa}$ under the
well-known quantum hardness of the Learning with Errors (QLWE) assumption. As a
byproduct, our work manifests an interesting connection between the NTCF$^1_2$
(resp. NTCF$^1_{\kappa}$) and the Dihedral Coset States (resp. Extrapolated
Dihedral Coset States). Finally, we give a similar interactive protocol for
proving quantumness from the NTCF$^1_{\kappa}$.

color space with photometry measurements from DELS ($z$), VIKING/UKIDSS

brown dwarfs are not fully consistent with the empirical brown dwarf model that
is commonly used in quasar candidate selection methods. To refine spectroscopic
confirmation strategies, we simulate synthetic spectroscopy of high-$z$ quasars

spectroscopic data in HzQCA. We predict the required exposure times for quasar
confirmation and propose and optimal strategy for spectroscopic follow-up
observations. For example, we demonstrate that we can identify a $m_J=21.5$ at
$z=7.6$ or a $m_J=23.0$ at $z=7.0$ within 15\,min of exposure time with LRIS.

account the scattering by random heterogeneities. The approach builds on the
method of images, where the half-space problem is extended to a full-space,
with two symmetric sources and an even map of mechanical properties. Two
contributions to the total energy density are then identified: one similar to
the energy density propagation in a full-space, for which the resulting lack of
statistical stationarity of the medium properties has no leading-order effect;
and one supported within one wavelength of the boundary, which describes
interference effects between the waves produced by the two symmetric sources.

tiling of polygonal cells, with a mechanical energy governed by deviations in
cell shape from preferred, or target, area, $A_0$, and perimeter, $P_0$. The
model exhibits a rigidity transition driven by geometric incompatibility as
tuned by the target shape index, $p_0 = P_0 / \sqrt{A_0}$. For $p_0 > p_*(6) =
\sqrt{8 \sqrt{3}} \approx 3.72$, with $p_*(6)$ the perimeter of a regular
hexagon of unit area, a cell can simultaneously attain both the preferred area
and preferred perimeter. As a result, the tissue is in a mechanically soft
compatible state, with zero shear and Young's moduli. For $p_0 < p_*(6)$, it is
geometrically impossible for any cell to realize the preferred area and

calculation of the linear elastic moduli of an ordered vertex model. We analyze
a relaxation step that includes non-affine deformations, leading to a softer
response than previously reported. The origin of the vanishing shear and
Young's moduli in the compatible state is the presence of zero-energy
deformations of cell shape. The bulk modulus exhibits a jump discontinuity at
the transition and can be lower in the rigid state than in the fluid-like
state. The Poisson's ratio can become negative which lowers the bulk and
Young's moduli. Our work provides a unified treatment of linear elasticity for
the vertex model and demonstrates that this linear response is

MR and negative MTP for a magnetic field oriented along the excitation current

materials. Here, we report a very different magneto-thermoelectric transport
behavior in the massive Dirac material ZrTe5. Although thin flakes show a
commonly observed positive MR in a perpendicular magnetic field, distinct from
other Dirac materials, we observe a sharp negative MTP. In a parallel magnetic

positive MTP is observed for the fields parallel to the thermal gradients. Our

learning on the dynamic graph has not been explored yet, and thus we study the
learning problem of node feature generation mechanism on such ubiquitous

contemporaneous relationships and time-lagged interaction relationships between

effectively characterize the feature generation process in a concise way. To
learn such a DAG, we cast the learning problem as a continuous score-based

measure the validity of the learned DAGs and a smooth acyclicity constraint to
ensure the acyclicity of the learned DAGs. These two components are translated
into an unconstraint augmented Lagrangian objective which could be minimized by
mature continuous optimization techniques. The resulting algorithm, named
GraphNOTEARS, outperforms baselines on simulated data across a wide range of

research on detecting abusive language covers different platforms, languages,

well in cross-domain evaluation settings. To overcome this, a common strategy
is to use a few samples from the target domain to train models to get better
performance in that domain (cross-domain few-shot training). However, this
might cause the models to overfit the artefacts of those samples. A compelling
solution could be to guide the models toward rationales, i.e., spans of text
that justify the text's label. This method has been found to improve model
performance in the in-domain setting across various NLP tasks. In this paper,
we propose RAFT (Rationale Adaptor for Few-shoT classification) for abusive
language detection. We first build a multitask learning setup to jointly learn
rationales, targets, and labels, and find a significant improvement of 6% macro
F1 on the rationale detection task over training solely rationale classifiers.
We introduce two rationale-integrated BERT-based architectures (the RAFT
models) and evaluate our systems over five different abusive language datasets,
finding that in the few-shot classification setting, RAFT-based models
outperform baseline models by about 7% in macro F1 scores and perform
competitively to models finetuned on other source domains. Furthermore,
RAFT-based models outperform LIME/SHAP-based approaches in terms of
plausibility and are close in performance in terms of faithfulness.

driving, due to the strong interaction between the controlled vehicle and the

induces a dependence of the vehicles' states on the (stochastic) dynamics of
the surrounding vehicles, increasing the difficulty of predicting future
trajectories. Furthermore, the small relative distances cause traditional
robust approaches to become overly conservative, necessitating control methods
that are explicitly aware of inter-vehicle interaction. Towards these goals, we
propose an interaction-aware stochastic model predictive control (MPC) strategy
integrated with an online learning framework, which models a given driver's
cooperation level as an unknown parameter in a state-dependent probability

surrounding vehicle's cooperation level with the vehicle's past trajectory and
combines this with a kinematic vehicle model to predict the probability of a
multimodal future state trajectory. The learning is conducted with logistic

astrophysical bodies. Prior spherical shell studies have shown that the
convection dynamics in polar regions can differ significantly from the lower
latitude, equatorial dynamics. Yet most spherical shell convective scaling laws
use globally-averaged quantities that erase latitudinal differences in the
physics. Here we quantify those latitudinal differences by analyzing spherical
shell simulations in terms of their regionalized convective heat transfer
properties. This is done by measuring local Nusselt numbers in two specific,
latitudinally separate, portions of the shell, the polar and the equatorial
regions, $Nu_p$ and $Nu_e$, respectively. In rotating spherical shells,
convection first sets in outside the tangent cylinder such that equatorial heat
transfer dominates at small and moderate supercriticalities. We show that the
buoyancy forcing, parameterized by the Rayleigh number $Ra$, must exceed the
critical equatorial forcing by a factor of $\approx 20$ to trigger polar
convection within the tangent cylinder. Once triggered, $Nu_p$ increases with
$Ra$ much faster than does $Nu_e$. The equatorial and polar heat fluxes then
tend to become comparable at sufficiently high $Ra$. Comparisons between the
polar convection data and Cartesian numerical simulations reveal quantitative
agreement between the two geometries in terms of heat transfer and averaged
bulk temperature gradient. This agreement indicates that spherical shell
rotating convection dynamics are accessible both through spherical simulations
and via reduced investigatory pathways, be they theoretical, numerical or
experimental.

hand, existing methods work with the zero-curvature Euclidean space, and
largely ignore the fact that curvature varies over the coming graph sequence.
On the other hand, continual learners in the literature rely on abundant
labels, but labeling graph in practice is particularly hard especially for the
continuously emerging graphs on-the-fly. To address the aforementioned
challenges, we propose to explore a challenging yet practical problem, the
self-supervised continual graph learning in adaptive Riemannian spaces. In this

a unified GCN coupled with a neural curvature adapter, so that Riemannian space
is shaped by the learnt curvature adaptive to each graph. Then, we present a
Label-free Lorentz Distillation approach, in which we create teacher-student
AdaRGCN for the graph sequence. The student successively performs
intra-distillation from itself and inter-distillation from the teacher so as to
consolidate knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. In particular, we
propose a theoretically grounded Generalized Lorentz Projection for the
contrastive distillation in Riemannian space. Extensive experiments on the
benchmark datasets show the superiority of RieGrace, and additionally, we
investigate on how curvature changes over the graph sequence.

chiral monolayer assemblies formed by hard rod-like colloidal particles in the
presence of non-adsorbing polymer and characterize the thermodynamic driving
forces responsible for the twisting. Simulations show that straight (achiral)
rods assemble into monolayers with a spontaneous twist that is either left- or
right-handed, while helical (chiral) rods lead to assemblies with preferential
chiral features that depend on their handedness and curliness. The onset of
chirality in these monolayers can be traced back to small clusters formed at
the initial stage of the self-assembly. In these microscopic monolayers,
entropy drives twisting in ways that differ from the assumptions on which
existing continuum theory is built. Depending on the geometry of the
constituent rods, the preferred chiral twist can be driven by entropy gain of
the polymers, or of the rods, or both. In addition, the variation of the
polymer entropy with twist depends on changes in both the surface area and the
volume of the monolayer. Rod fluctuations perpendicular to the monolayer also
play an important role in stabilising the twisting.

This paper applies discrete OT to a swarm of UAVs in a novel way to achieve
appropriate task allocation and execution. Drone swarm deployments already
operate in multiple domains where sensors are used to gain knowledge of an

thermal and RGB imaging create a specific need for an algorithm that considers
parameters on both the UAV and waypoint side and allows for updating the
matching scheme as the swarm gains information from the environment.
Additionally, the need for a centralized planner can be removed by using a
distributed algorithm that can dynamically update based on changes in the swarm
network or parameters. To this end, we develop a dynamic and distributed OT
algorithm that matches a UAV to the optimal waypoint based on one parameter at
the UAV and another parameter at the waypoint. We show the convergence and
allocation of the algorithm through a case study and test the algorithm's
effectiveness against a greedy assignment algorithm in simulation.

important determinant of its macroeconomic growth. In this paper, we
investigate one channel through which trust might support economic performance:
through the levels of patience, also known as time preference in the economics

preference can be modelled as optimal Bayesian inference based on noisy signals
about the future, so that it is affected by the perceived certainty of future
outcomes. Drawing on neuroscience literature, we argue that the mechanism
linking trust and patience could be facilitated by the neurotransmitter
oxytocin. On the one hand, it is a neural correlate of trusting behavior. On
the other, it has an impact on the brain's encoding of prediction error, and
could therefore increase the perceived certainty of a neural representation of
a future event. The relationship between trust and time preference is tested
experimentally using the Trust Game. While the paper does not find a
significant effect of trust on time preference or the levels of certainty, it
proposes an experimental design that can successfully manipulate people's
short-term levels of trust for experimental purposes.

nucleon, vector meson-nucleon scattering length $|\alpha_{VN}|$, is an
important component of the study of hadronic interactions. Nowadays many
scattering length values $|\alpha_{VN}|$ have been reported using the recent

anomalous energy contribution to the proton mass is also a hot topic in
non-perturbative QCD and hadron physics. However, it is difficult to measure
proton trace anomalous energy experimentally, and the study of the trace
anomaly of proton is still inconclusive. In this study, we established the
relationship between the scattering length of the vector meson-proton

With the scattering length values extracted by using the Vector Meson Dominance

(22.8$\%$ $\pm$ 1.2$\%$), which is of similar order of magnitude as the 23$\%$
given by Lattice QCD calculation. We conjecture that the trace anomaly
contribution of nucleon is independent of the type of vector meson probe. We
hope that high precision measurements of vector meson-nucleon scattering length

the development of thin hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) detectors on

hardness, the benefit for the above-mentioned applications can be appreciated
mostly in radiation harsh environments. Furthermore, the possibility to deposit
this material on flexible substrates like Polyimide (PI), polyethylene
naphthalate (PEN) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) facilitates the usage of
these detectors in medical dosimetry, beam flux and beam profile measurements.
Particularly interesting is its use when positioned directly on the flange of
the vacuum-to-air separation interface in a beam line, as well as other
applications where a thin self-standing radiation flux detector is envisaged.
In this paper, the HASPIDE project will be described and some preliminary

parameters that include anisotropy axes both in the orbital and spin spaces.
The anisotropy axes characterize the broken symmetries in these macroscopically
coherent quantum many-body systems. The systems' free energy has several
degenerate minima for certain orientations of the anisotropy axes. As a result,
spatial variation of the order parameter between two such regions, settled in
different energy minima, forms a topological soliton. Such solitons can
terminate in the bulk liquid, where the termination line forms a vortex with
trapped circulation of mass and spin superfluid currents. Here we discuss
possible soliton-vortex structures based on the symmetry and topology arguments
and focus on the three structures observed in experiments: solitons bounded by
spin-mass vortices in the B phase, solitons bounded by half-quantum vortices in
the polar and polar-distorted A phases, and the composite defect formed by a
half-quantum vortex, soliton and the Kibble-Lazarides-Shafi wall in the
polar-distorted B phase. The observations are based on nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) techniques and are of three types: first, solitons can form a
potential well for trapped spin waves, observed as an extra peak in the NMR
spectrum at shifted frequency; second, they can increase the relaxation rate of
the NMR spin precession; lastly, the soliton can present the boundary
conditions for the anisotropy axes in bulk, modifying the bulk NMR signal.
Owing to solitons' prominent NMR signatures and the ability to manipulate their
structure with external magnetic field, solitons have become an important tool
for probing and controlling the structure and dynamics of superfluid $^3$He, in
particular half-quantum vortices with core-bound Majorana modes.

is currently the most commonly used and best-performing method to enhance model
robustness in sparse scenarios with few labeled samples. Differing from
homogeneous graph, DA in heterogeneous graph has greater challenges:
heterogeneity of information requires DA strategies to effectively handle
heterogeneous relations, which considers the information contribution of
different types of neighbors and edges to the target nodes. Furthermore,
over-squashing of information is caused by the negative curvature that formed
by the non-uniformity distribution and strong clustering in complex graph. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel method named
Semi-Supervised Heterogeneous Graph Learning with Multi-level Data Augmentation
(HG-MDA). For the problem of heterogeneity of information in DA, node and
topology augmentation strategies are proposed for the characteristics of
heterogeneous graph. And meta-relation-based attention is applied as one of the
indexes for selecting augmented nodes and edges. For the problem of
over-squashing of information, triangle based edge adding and removing are
designed to alleviate the negative curvature and bring the gain of topology.
Finally, the loss function consists of the cross-entropy loss for labeled data
and the consistency regularization for unlabeled data. In order to effectively
fuse the prediction results of various DA strategies, the sharpening is used.
Existing experiments on public datasets, i.e., ACM, DBLP, OGB, and industry
dataset MB show that HG-MDA outperforms current SOTA models. Additionly, HG-MDA
is applied to user identification in internet finance scenarios, helping the

high-power lasers have become both increasingly powerful and more widely

restricted to single-shot experiments with limited parameter exploration.
However, recent technological improvements make it possible to gather an
increasing amount of data, both in experiments and simulations. This has
sparked interest in using advanced techniques from mathematics, statistics and
computer science to deal with, and benefit from, big data. At the same time,
sophisticated modeling techniques also provide new ways for researchers to
effectively deal with situations in which still only sparse amounts of data are
available. This paper aims to present an overview of relevant machine learning
methods with focus on applicability to laser-plasma physics, including its
important sub-fields of laser-plasma acceleration and inertial confinement

a distribution $\pi(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$ and $x$ is constrained on a convex
body $\mathcal{C}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Motivated by penalty methods from
optimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (PHMC) that convert the constrained sampling problem
into an unconstrained one by introducing a penalty function for constraint
violations. When $f$ is smooth and the gradient is available, we show
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to
sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in
terms of the total variation distance and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)$ hides
some logarithmic factors. For PHMC, we improve this result to
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is
Lipschitz and the boundary of $\mathcal{C}$ is sufficiently smooth. To our
knowledge, these are the first convergence rate results for Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo methods in the constrained sampling setting that can handle non-convex
$f$ and can provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among
existing methods with deterministic gradients. We then consider the setting
where unbiased stochastic gradients are available. We propose PSGLD and PSGHMC
that can handle stochastic gradients without Metropolis-Hasting correction
steps. When $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, we obtain an iteration
complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{18})$ and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{39})$ respectively in the
2-Wasserstein distance. For the more general case, when $f$ is smooth and
non-convex, we also provide finite-time performance bounds and iteration
complexity results. Finally, we test our algorithms on Bayesian LASSO
regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems.

achieving a high-efficiency degree constitutes a challenging task for

The aim is to simultaneously maximize throughput and minimize total buffer

considering the stochastic behavior of the system. An enhanced simulation-based
multi-objective optimization (SMO) approach with customized simulation and

Understanding antibody structure and its paratope can facilitate a mechanistic
understanding of its function. Therefore, antibody structure prediction from
its sequence alone has always been a highly valuable problem for de novo
antibody design. AlphaFold2, a breakthrough in the field of structural biology,
provides a solution to predict protein structure based on protein sequences and
computationally expensive coevolutionary multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
However, the computational efficiency and undesirable prediction accuracy of
antibodies, especially on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of
antibodies limit their applications in the industrially high-throughput drug
design. To learn an informative representation of antibodies, we employed a
deep antibody language model (ALM) on curated sequences from the observed
antibody space database via a transformer model. We also developed a novel
model named xTrimoABFold to predict antibody structure from antibody sequence
based on the pretrained ALM as well as efficient evoformers and structural
modules. The model was trained end-to-end on the antibody structures in PDB by
minimizing the ensemble loss of domain-specific focal loss on CDR and the
frame-aligned point loss. xTrimoABFold outperforms AlphaFold2 and other protein
language model based SOTAs, e.g., OmegaFold, HelixFold-Single, and IgFold with
a large significant margin (30+\% improvement on RMSD) while performing 151
times faster than AlphaFold2. To the best of our knowledge, xTrimoABFold
achieved state-of-the-art antibody structure prediction. Its improvement in
both accuracy and efficiency makes it a valuable tool for de novo antibody

Substrate Layers (CRO-SL) algorithm. The CRO-SL is an evolutionary-based
ensemble approach, able to combine different search procedures within a single
population. In this work we discuss two different probabilistic strategies to
improve the algorithm. First, we defined the Probabilistic CRO-SL (PCRO-SL),
which substitutes the substrates in the CRO-SL population by {\em tags}
associated with each individual. Each tag represents a different operator which
will modify the individual in the reproduction phase. In each generation of the
algorithm, the tags are randomly assigned to the individuals with a similar
probability, obtaining this way an ensemble with a more intense change in the
application of different operators to a given individual than the original
CRO-SL. The second strategy discussed in this paper is the Dynamical
Probabilistic CRO-SL (DPCRO-SL), in which the probability of tag assignment is
modified during the evolution of the algorithm, depending on the quality of the
solutions generated in each substrate. Thus, the best substrates in the search
process will be assigned with a higher probability that those which showed a
worse performance during the search. We test the performance of the proposed
probabilistic and dynamic ensembles in different optimization problems,
including benchmark functions and a real application of wind turbines layout
optimization, comparing the results obtained with that of existing algorithms

transformer network to conduct hand gesture recognition using highdensity sEMG
(HD-sEMG) signals. The attention mechanism in the proposed model identifies
similarities among different data segments with a greater capacity for parallel

inputs of large sequence lengths. CT-HGR can be trained from scratch without
any need for transfer learning and can simultaneously extract both temporal and
spatial features of HD-sEMG data. Additionally, the CT-HGR framework can
perform instantaneous recognition using sEMG image spatially composed from
HD-sEMG signals. A variant of the CT-HGR is also designed to incorporate
microscopic neural drive information in the form of Motor Unit Spike Trains
(MUSTs) extracted from HD-sEMG signals using Blind Source Separation (BSS).
This variant is combined with its baseline version via a hybrid architecture to
evaluate potentials of fusing macroscopic and microscopic neural drive

This can be extended to matrix spaces by taking $X$ to be a tuple of real

\otimes I_d + A_1 \otimes X_1 + A_2 \otimes X_2 + \dots + A_g \otimes X_g.$$
The solution set of $L_A (X) \succeq 0$ is called a \textit{free

operator algebras, and the theory of matrix convex sets. Matrix and free
extreme points of free spectrahedra are of particular interest. While many
authors have studied matrix and free extreme points of free spectrahedra, it
has until now been unknown if these two types of extreme points are actually
different. The results of this paper fall into three categories: theoretical,
algorithmic, and experimental. Firstly, we prove the existence of matrix
extreme points of free spectrahedra that are not free extreme. This is done by
producing exact examples of matrix extreme points that are not free extreme. We
also show that if the $A_i$ are $2 \times 2$ matrices, then matrix and free
extreme points coincide. Secondly, we detail methods for constructing matrix
extreme points of free spectrahedra that are not free extreme, both exactly and
numerically. We also show how a recent result due to Kriel (Complex
Anal.~Oper.~Theory 2019) can be used to efficiently test whether a point is
matrix extreme. Thirdly, we provide evidence that a substantial number of
matrix extreme points of free spectrahedra are not free extreme. Numerical work
in another direction shows how to effectively write a given tuple in a free
spectrahedron as a matrix convex combination of its free extreme points.

scientific and commercial activities to the lunar South Pole, while placing a
moratorium on activities at the North Pole until the full consequences of human
activities at the South Pole are fully understood and mitigation protocols
established. Depending on the pace at which lunar exploration proceeds, such a
moratorium might last for several decades in order to properly assess the
effects of exploration and commercial activities in regions surrounding the
South Pole. A longer term possibility might be to consider designating the
lunar North Polar region as a (possibly temporary) Planetary Park. Similar
protected status might also be desirable for other unique lunar environments,
and, by extension, other scientifically important localities elsewhere in the
Solar System.

problem, but also in the class overlapping problem which is complex. However,
most of the existing algorithms mainly focus on the former. The limitation
prevents the existing methods from breaking through. To address this
limitation, this paper proposes an ensemble learning algorithm based on dual
clustering and stage-wise hybrid sampling (DCSHS). The DCSHS has three parts.
Firstly, we design a projection clustering combination framework (PCC) guided
by Davies-Bouldin clustering effectiveness index (DBI), which is used to obtain
high-quality clusters and combine them to obtain a set of cross-complete
subsets (CCS) with balanced class and low overlapping. Secondly, according to
the characteristics of subset classes, a stage-wise hybrid sampling algorithm
is designed to realize the de-overlapping and balancing of subsets. Finally, a
projective clustering transfer mapping mechanism (CTM) is constructed for all
processed subsets by means of transfer learning, thereby reducing class
overlapping and explore structure information of samples. The major advantage
of our algorithm is that it can exploit the intersectionality of the CCS to
realize the soft elimination of overlapping majority samples, and learn as much
information of overlapping samples as possible, thereby enhancing the class
overlapping while class balancing. In the experimental section, more than 30
public datasets and over ten representative algorithms are chosen for
verification. The experimental results show that the DCSHS is significantly
best in terms of various evaluation criteria.
