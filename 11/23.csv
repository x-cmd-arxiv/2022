state space $\mathbb{N}$, whose transition matrix is standard and whose density
matrix is the given birth-death matrix. Birth and death processes are unique if
and only if $\infty$ is entrance or natural. When $\infty$ is neither entrance
nor natural, there have appeared two methods in history to obtain all birth and
death processes. The first one is an analytic treatment put forward by Feller
in 1959, and the second is a probabilistic construction completed by Wang in
1958.
  In this paper we will raise a third way by virtue of the Ray-Knight
compactification. This new way has benefits of both analytic and probabilistic
treatments. By Ray-Knight compactification, every birth and death process
admits a modification regarded as a Ray process on
$\mathbb{N}_\infty=\mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$. All of them are further
classified into two classes: One is the class of celebrated Doob processes and
the other one is the class of Feller $Q$-processes. Every birth and death
process in the second class is actually a Feller process on
$\mathbb{N}_\infty$. We will derive the expression of its infinitesimal
operator, which indicates probabilistic heuristics for its boundary behaviours
at $\infty$. Furthermore, utilizing transformations of killing and
Ikeda-Nagasawa-Watanabe's piecing out, we will also give a probabilistic
construction for all birth and death processes.

specialized to $\lambda=\frac\pi3$, corresponding to the contractible loop
fugacity $\beta=-2\cos4\lambda=1$. We study the functional relations satisfied
by the commuting transfer matrices of this model and the associated Bethe
ansatz equations. The single and double row transfer matrices are respectively
endowed with strip and periodic boundary conditions, and are elements of the
ordinary and periodic dilute Temperley-Lieb algebras. The standard modules for
these algebras are labeled by the number of defects $d$ and, in the latter
case, also by the twist $e^{i\gamma}$. Nonlinear integral equation techniques
are used to analytically solve the Bethe ansatz functional equations in the
scaling limit for the central charge $c=0$ and conformal weights
$\Delta,\bar\Delta$. For the groundstates, we find $\Delta=\Delta_{1,d+1}$ for
strip boundary conditions and
$(\Delta,\bar\Delta)=(\Delta_{\gamma/\pi,d/2},\Delta_{\gamma/\pi,-d/2})$ for
periodic boundary conditions, where $\Delta_{r,s}=\frac1{24}((3r-2s)^2-1)$. We
give explicit conjectures for the scaling limit of the trace of the transfer
matrix in each standard module. For $d\le8$, these conjectures are supported by
numerical solutions of the logarithmic form of the Bethe ansatz equations for
the leading $20$ or more conformal eigenenergies. With these conjectures, we
apply the Markov traces to obtain the conformal partition functions on the
cylinder and torus. These precisely coincide with our previous results for
critical bond percolation on the square lattice described by the dense
$A_1^{(1)}$ loop model with $\lambda=\frac\pi3$. The concurrence of all this
conformal data provides compelling evidence supporting a strong form of
universality between these two stochastic models as logarithmic CFTs.

applications, e.g., autonomous driving, and explainability of such models is
becoming a pressing concern. Among explanation methods, counterfactual
explanations aim to find minimal and interpretable changes to the input image
that would also change the output of the model to be explained. Such
explanations point end-users at the main factors that impact the decision of
the model. However, previous methods struggle to explain decision models
trained on images with many objects, e.g., urban scenes, which are more
difficult to work with but also arguably more critical to explain. In this
work, we propose to tackle this issue with an object-centric framework for
counterfactual explanation generation. Our method, inspired by recent
generative modeling works, encodes the query image into a latent space that is
structured in a way to ease object-level manipulations. Doing so, it provides
the end-user with control over which search directions (e.g., spatial
displacement of objects, style modification, etc.) are to be explored during
the counterfactual generation. We conduct a set of experiments on
counterfactual explanation benchmarks for driving scenes, and we show that our
method can be adapted beyond classification, e.g., to explain semantic
segmentation models. To complete our analysis, we design and run a user study
that measures the usefulness of counterfactual explanations in understanding a

following the chain length distribution and analysing the probability of

its viscoelasticity assumes an anisotropic signature, with both viscous and

algorithmic structures can, and should, be used. We generalize our previously
introduced Runge-Kutta neural network to a recursively recurrent neural network
(R2N2) superstructure for the design of customized iterative algorithms. In
contrast to off-the-shelf deep learning approaches, it features a distinct
division into modules for generation of information and for the subsequent
assembly of this information towards a solution. Local information in the form
of a subspace is generated by subordinate, inner, iterations of recurrent
function evaluations starting at the current outer iterate. The update to the
next outer iterate is computed as a linear combination of these evaluations,
reducing the residual in this space, and constitutes the output of the network.
We demonstrate that regular training of the weight parameters inside the
proposed superstructure on input/output data of various computational problem
classes yields iterations similar to Krylov solvers for linear equation
systems, Newton-Krylov solvers for nonlinear equation systems, and Runge-Kutta
integrators for ordinary differential equations. Due to its modularity, the
superstructure can be readily extended with functionalities needed to represent
more general classes of iterative algorithms traditionally based on Taylor
series expansions.

(ESR) study of rare-earth titanates derived from the spin-1/2 Mott insulator
YTiO$_3$. Measurements of single-crystalline samples of (Y,Ca,La)TiO$_3$ in a
wide range of isovalent substitution (La) and hole doping (Ca) reveal several
unusual features in the paramagnetic state of these materials. $^{89}$Y NMR
demonstrates a clear discrepancy between the static and dynamic local magnetic
susceptibilities, with deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior far above the Curie
temperature $T_C$. No significant changes are observed close to $T_C$, but a
suppression of fluctuations is detected in the NMR spin-lattice relaxation time
at temperatures of about $3\times T_C$. Additionally, the nuclear spin-spin
relaxation rate shows an unusual peak in dependence on temperature for all
samples. ESR of the unpaired Ti electron shows broad resonance lines at all
temperatures and substitution/doping levels, which we find to be caused by
short electronic spin-lattice relaxation times. We model the relaxation as an
Orbach process that involves a low-lying electronic excited state, which
enables the determination of the excited-state gap from the temperature
dependence of the ESR linewidths. We ascribe the small gap to Jahn-Teller
splitting of the two lower Ti $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The value of the gap closely
follows $T_C$ and is consistent with the temperatures at which deviations from
Curie-Weiss fluctuations are observed in NMR. These results provide insight
into the interplay between orbital and spin degrees of freedom in rare-earth
titanates and indicate that full orbital degeneracy lifting is associated with
ferromagnetic order.

Depending on the position of the interface, there exist two exclusive ways to
model the dynamics: (1) Type A dynamics whereby the interface is placed between
two lattice points, and (2) Type B dynamics whereby the interface is placed on
a lattice point. For both types, we obtain exact results for the
one-dimensional generating function of the Green's function or propagator for
the composite system in unbounded domain as well as domains confined with
reflecting, absorbing, and mixed boundaries. For the case with reflecting
confinement in the absence of bias, the steady-state probability shows a
step-like behavior for the Type A dynamics, while it is uniform for the Type B
dynamics. We also derive explicit expressions for the first-passage probability
and the mean first-passage time, and compare the hitting time dependence to a
single target. Finally, considering the continuous-space continuous-time limit
of the propagator, we obtain the boundary conditions at the interface. At the
interface, while the flux is the same, the probability density is discontinuous
for Type A and is continuous for Type B. For the latter we derive a generalized
version of the so-called leather boundary condition in the appropriate limit.

above the Barvinok-Pataki bound (where a globally optimal solution of rank at

  We also show that continuous $R$-valuations have close connections to

domain of the extended nonnegative reals: (1) On every coherent topological
space, every non-zero, bounded $\tau$-smooth measure $\mu$ (defined on the

to Lebesgue measure on the unit interval. As a result, the Lebesgue measure can

the first black hole mergers by LIGO in 2015, followed by the first multi

has been discussed in detail in the literature, the potential for joint
observations has thus far been ignored. In this article, we aim to define how
GW observations can best contribute to gamma ray polarimetry and study the
scientific potential of joint analyses. In addition we aim to provide
predictions on feasibility of such joint measurements in the near future. We
study which GW observables can be combined with measurements from gamma ray
polarimetry to improve the discriminating power regarding GRB emission models.
We then provide forecasts for the joint detection capabilities of current and
future GW detectors and polarimeters. Our results show that by adding GW data
to polarimetry, a single precise joint detection would allow to rule out the
majority of emission models. We show that in the coming years joint detections
between GW and gamma ray polarimeters might already be possible. Although these
would allow to constrain part of the model space, the probability of highly
constraining joint detections will remain small in the near future. However,
the scientific merit held by even a single such measurement makes it important
to pursue such an endeavour. Furthermore, we show that using the next

supply of liquidity, through cash holdings, and their exposures to risky
interbank loans. The value of interbank loans jumps when banks suffer liquidity
shortages, which can be caused by the arrival of large enough liquidity shocks.
In two distinct settings, we compute the unique optimal allocations of capital.
In the first, banks seek only to maximize their own utility -- in a
decentralized manner. Second, a central planner aims to maximize the sum of all
banks' utilities. Both of the resulting financial networks exhibit a
`core-periphery' structure. However, the optimal allocations differ --
decentralized banks are more susceptible to liquidity shortages, while the
planner ensures that banks with more debt hold greater liquidity. We
characterize the behavior of the planner's optimal allocation as the size of
the system grows. Surprisingly, the `price of anarchy' is of constant order.
Finally, we derive capitalization requirements that cause the decentralized
system to achieve the planner's level of risk. In doing so, we find that
systemically important banks must face the greatest losses when they suffer
liquidity crises -- ensuring that they are incentivized to avoid such crises.

the instantaneous luminosity during a fill. This was achieved by tuning the
distance between the two colliding beams according to the measurement of
instantaneous luminosity from hardware-based trigger counters. The upgraded
LHCb detector operates at fivefold instantaneous luminosity compared to the
previous runs, and it has a fully software-based trigger. Consequently, a new
approach to the luminosity measurement is adopted. New counters, with
particular attention to maximum stability in time, and a new dedicated detector
have been introduced for Run~3. Additionally, in order to verify linearity from
calibration to data taking conditions, per-fill emittance scans are performed.

also easy to calculate. However, different definitions of flows and operators
can differ significantly, suggesting possible systematical effects. Using a

find that for this set of gauge field ensembles Zeuthen flow with Symanzik

very small cutoff corrections. Tree-level improvement, traditionally used in
step-scaling studies, significantly reduces the spread between different

reducing cutoff effects for gradient flow scales $\sqrt{t_0}$ or $w_0$.

  Haptic Interaction",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Bimanual object manipulation involves multiple visuo-haptic sensory feedbacks
arising from the interaction with the environment that are managed from the
central nervous system and consequently translated in motor commands. Kinematic
strategies that occur during bimanual coupled tasks are still a scientific
debate despite modern advances in haptics and robotics. Current technologies
may have the potential to provide realistic scenarios involving the entire
upper limb extremities during multi-joint movements but are not yet exploited
to their full potential. The present study explores how hands dynamically
interact when manipulating a shared object through the use of two
impedance-controlled exoskeletons programmed to simulate bimanually coupled
manipulation of virtual objects. We enrolled twenty-six participants (2 groups:
right-handed and left-handed) who were requested to use both hands to grab
simulated objects across the robot workspace and place them in specific
locations. The virtual objects were rendered with different dynamic proprieties
and textures influencing the manipulation strategies to complete the tasks.
Results revealed that the roles of hands are related to the movement direction,
the haptic features, and the handedness preference. Outcomes suggested that the
haptic feedback affects bimanual strategies depending on the movement
direction. However, left-handers show better control of the force applied
between the two hands, probably due to environmental pressures for right-handed
manipulations.

candidates or items in personalized recommender systems. Since the candidate
set is only known in real time, the LP also needs to be formed and solved in
real time. Latency and user experience are major considerations, requiring the
LP to be solved within just a few milliseconds. Although typical instances of
the problem are not very large in size, this stringent time limit appears to be
beyond the capability of most existing (commercial) LP solvers, which can take
$20$ milliseconds or more to find a solution. Thus, reliable methods that
address the real-world complication of latency become necessary. In this paper,
we propose a fast specialized LP solver for a structured problem with diversity
constraints. Our method solves the dual problem, making use of the piece-wise
affine structure of the dual objective function, with an additional screening
technique that helps reduce the dimensionality of the problem as the algorithm
progresses. Experiments reveal that our method can solve the problem within
roughly 1 millisecond, yielding a 20x improvement in speed over efficient
off-the-shelf LP solvers. This speed-up can help improve the quality of
recommendations without affecting user experience, highlighting how
optimization can provide solid orthogonal value to machine-learned recommender

a cross-frame self-attention module. It is trained to perform complex spectral
mapping, where the real and imaginary (RI) components of input signals are
stacked as features to predict target RI components. We first evaluate it on
monaural anechoic speaker separation. Without using data augmentation and
dynamic mixing, it obtains a state-of-the-art 23.5 dB improvement in
scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) on WSJ0-2mix, a standard

reverberation, we evaluate it on monaural reverberant speaker separation using
the SMS-WSJ dataset and on noisy-reverberant speaker separation using WHAMR!,
and obtain state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. We then extend
TF-GridNet to multi-microphone conditions through multi-microphone complex
spectral mapping, and integrate it into a two-DNN system with a beamformer in

proposed in this paper is a novel multi-frame Wiener filter computed based on
the outputs of the first DNN. State-of-the-art performance is obtained on the
multi-channel tasks of SMS-WSJ and WHAMR!. Besides speaker separation, we apply
the proposed algorithms to speech dereverberation and noisy-reverberant speech

Renders of these reconstructions could play a role in virtual presence in the

depth-supervised NeRF (DS-NeRF) is trained with three or five synchronised
cameras that capture the surgical field in knee replacement surgery videos from
the 4D-OR dataset. The algorithm is trained and evaluated for images in five
distinct phases before and during the surgery. With qualitative analysis, we
inspect views synthesised by a virtual camera that moves in 180 degrees around
the surgical field. Additionally, we quantitatively inspect view synthesis from
an unseen camera position in terms of PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS for the colour
channels and in terms of MAE and error percentage for the estimated depth.
DS-NeRF generates geometrically consistent views, also from interpolated camera
positions. Views are generated from an unseen camera pose with an average PSNR

missing of fine details, the synthesised views do not look photo-realistic. Our

a local labour market with the mix of ALMP implemented outside this market but
in local employment agencies that partially overlap with this market. We find
no effects of short-term activation measures and further vocational training on
aggregate labour market outcomes. In contrast, wage subsidies substantially

of gravity, as used to describe perturbative quantum fields about some

correcting code with such a quantum field theory as the code subspace is not
isometric. We discuss how this framework can naturally arise in an algebraic
QFT treatment of a family of CFT with a large-$N$ limit described by the single
trace sector. We show that an isometric code can be recovered in the $N
\rightarrow \infty$ limit when acting on fixed states in the code Hilbert
space. Asymptotically isometric codes come equipped with the notion of simple
operators and nets of causal wedges. While the causal wedges are additive, they
need not satisfy Haag duality, thus leading to the possibility of non-trivial
entanglement wedge reconstructions. Codes with complementary recovery are
defined as having extensions to Haag dual nets, where entanglement wedges are
well defined for all causal boundary regions. We prove an asymptotic version of
the information disturbance trade-off theorem and use this to show that
boundary theory causality is maintained by net extensions. We give a
characterization of the existence of an entanglement wedge extension via the
asymptotic equality of bulk and boundary relative entropy or modular flow.
While these codes are asymptotically exact, at fixed $N$ they can have large
errors on states that do not survive the large-$N$ limit. This allows us to fix
well known issues that arise when modeling gravity as an exact codes, while
maintaining the nice features expected of gravity, including, among other
things, the emergence of non-trivial von Neumann algebras of various types.

that can be attained by ordering the tree? This variation of the problem of
counting inversions in arrays originated in mathematical psychology, with the
evaluation of the Mann--Whitney statistic for detecting differences between
distributions as a special case.
  We study the complexity of the problem in the comparison-query model, used
for problems like sorting and selection. For many types of trees with $n$
leaves, we establish lower bounds close to the strongest known in the model,
namely the lower bound of $\log_2(n!)$ for sorting $n$ items. We show:
  (a) $\log_2((\alpha(1-\alpha)n)!) - O(\log n)$ queries are needed whenever
the tree has a subtree that contains a fraction $\alpha$ of the leaves. This
implies a lower bound of $\log_2((\frac{k}{(k+1)^2}n)!) - O(\log n)$ for trees
of degree $k$.
  (b) $\log_2(n!) - O(\log n)$ queries are needed in case the tree is binary.
  (c) $\log_2(n!) - O(k \log k)$ queries are needed for certain classes of
trees of degree $k$, including perfect trees with even $k$.
  The lower bounds are obtained by developing two novel techniques for a
generic problem $\Pi$ in the comparison-query model and applying them to
inversion minimization on trees. Both techniques can be described in terms of
the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with adjacent-rank transpositions as
the generating set. Consider the subgraph consisting of the edges between
vertices with the same value under $\Pi$. We show that the size of any decision
tree for $\Pi$ must be at least:
  (i) the number of connected components of this subgraph, and
  (ii) the factorial of the average degree of the complementary subgraph,
divided by $n$.
  Lower bounds on query complexity then follow by taking the base-2 logarithm.

solving various types of QP, its convergence speed is known to be highly
dependent on the step-size parameter $\rho$. Due to the absence of a general

paper, we propose CA-ADMM (Context-aware Adaptive ADMM)) which learns to
adaptively adjust $\rho$ to accelerate ADMM. CA-ADMM extracts the
spatio-temporal context, which captures the dependency of the primal and dual

CA-ADMM chooses $\rho$ based on the extracted context. Through extensive
numerical experiments, we validated that CA-ADMM effectively generalizes to
unseen QP problems with different sizes and classes (i.e., having different QP

adjust $\rho$ considering the stage of the optimization process to accelerate

state-of-the-art approach for real image editing with inversion uses denoising
diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) to deterministically noise the image to the
intermediate state along the path that the denoising would follow given the
original conditioning. However, DDIM inversion for real images is unstable as
it relies on local linearization assumptions, which result in the propagation
of errors, leading to incorrect image reconstruction and loss of content. To
alleviate these problems, we propose Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled
Transformations (EDICT), an inversion method that draws inspiration from affine
coupling layers. EDICT enables mathematically exact inversion of real and
model-generated images by maintaining two coupled noise vectors which are used
to invert each other in an alternating fashion. Using Stable Diffusion, a
state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, we demonstrate that EDICT successfully
reconstructs real images with high fidelity. On complex image datasets like
MS-COCO, EDICT reconstruction significantly outperforms DDIM, improving the
mean square error of reconstruction by a factor of two. Using noise vectors
inverted from real images, EDICT enables a wide range of image edits--from
local and global semantic edits to image stylization--while maintaining
fidelity to the original image structure. EDICT requires no model

without finding any particular path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. It has been an open
problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for

algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set

not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a

capture the strain evolution of the quadrupolar and magnetic phase transitions

jump at the transitions, and the latter we show follows a modified Ehrenfest
relation. We find that antisymmetric strain couples to the underlying order
parameter in a bi-quadratic manner in the antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) phase but
in a linear-quadratic manner in the canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) phase; the
contrast is attributed to a preserved (broken) tetragonal symmetry in the AFQ
(CAFM) phase, respectively. The broken tetragonal symmetry in the CAFM phase is
further supported by elastocaloric strain-hysteresis and observation of two
sets of domains with mutually perpendicular principal axes in optical
birefringence. Additionally, when the quadrupolar moments are ordered in a
staggered fashion, we uncover an elastocaloric response that reflects a
quadratic increase of entropy with antisymmetric strain, analogous to the role
magnetic field plays for Ising antiferromagnets by promoting pseudospin flips.
Our results show that AC elastocaloric effect is a compact and incisive
thermodynamic probe into the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and
strain, which can potentially be applied to broader classes of quantum

exploiting the information obtained from Class Activation Maps (CAMs) is widely

producing non-complete prior information for segmentation tasks. In this study,
to obtain more coherent CAMs with segmentation labels, we propose a framework

an iterative self-improved model. The experiments performed with DeepLabv3 and

matter power spectrum. Using a common set of initial data we quantify the
relative agreement on the nonlinear power spectrum of cold dark matter and
baryons and, for the $N$-body codes, also the relative agreement on the
bispectrum, halo mass function, and halo bias. We find that the different

confident that we can model the impact of massive neutrinos at the sub-percent

their research objectives and academic goals. These challenges included
motivation, limited access to technologies at home, limited communication among

that this experience was highly beneficial. Comparisons between outcomes of

ranging from molecular transport through biological membranes to reverse
osmosis for water purification using artificial membranes. At the
single-particle level, one-dimensional diffusion through a barrier with
constant permeability $\kappa_0$ can be modeled in terms of so-called snapping
out Brownian motion (BM). The latter sews together successive rounds of
partially reflecting BMs that are restricted to either the left or right of the
barrier. Each round is killed (absorbed) at the barrier when its Brownian local
time exceeds an exponential random variable parameterized by $\kappa_0$. A new
round is then immediately started in either direction with equal probability.
It has recently been shown that the probability density for snapping out BM
satisfies a renewal equation that relates the full density to the probability
densities of partially reflected BM on either side of the barrier. Moreover,
generalized versions of the renewal equation can be constructed that
incorporate non-Markovian, encounter-based models of absorption. In this paper
we extend the renewal theory of snapping out BM to single-particle diffusion in
bounded domains and higher spatial dimensions. We also consider an example of
an asymmetric interface in which the directional switching after each
absorption event is biased. Finally, we show how to incorporate an
encounter-based model of absorption for single-particle diffusion through a
spherically symmetric interface. We find that, even when the same non-Markovian
model of absorption applies on either side of the interface, the resulting
permeability is an asymmetric time-dependent function with memory. Moreover,
the permeability functions tend to be heavy-tailed.

cell voltage. By quantifying overvoltages in the Li Bi cell with a mixed cation

\in \R^d$ with its boundary $\partial \Omega$ totally absorbing. We assume that
the target is surrounded by a semipermeable interface given by the closed
surface $\partial \calM$ with $\Omega \subset \calM\subset \R^d$. That is, the
interface totally surrounds the target and thus partially screens the diffusive
search process. We also assume that the position of the diffusing particle
(searcher) randomly resets to its initial position $\x_0$ according to a
Poisson process with a resetting rate $r$. The location $\x_0$ is taken to be
outside the interface, $\x_0\in \calM^c$, which means that resetting does not
occur when the particle is within the interior of $\partial \calM$. Hence, the
semipermeable interface also screens out the effects of resetting. We first
solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for diffusion on the half-line $x\in
[0,\infty)$ with an absorbing boundary at $x=0$, a semipermeable barrier at
$x=L$, and stochastic resetting to $x_0>L$ for all $x>L$. We calculate the mean
first passage time (MFPT) to be absorbed by the target and explore its behavior
as a function of the permeability $\kappa_0$ of the interface and its spatial
position $L$. We then perform the analogous calculations for a
three-dimensional (3D) spherically symmetric interface and target, and show
that the MFPT exhibits the same qualitative behavior as the 1D case. Finally,
we introduce a stochastic single-particle realization of the search process
based on a generalization of so-called snapping out BM. The latter sews
together successive rounds of reflecting Brownian motion on either side of the

MHz frequency range. These mechanical resonators are of particular interest for
force sensing applications and quantum optomechanics at room temperature.
Tensile-strained crystalline materials that are compatible with epitaxial
growth of heterostructures would thereby allow realizing monolithic free-space
optomechanical devices, which benefit from stability, ultra-small mode volumes
and scalability. In our work, we demonstrate micromechanical resonators made
from tensile-strained InGaP, which is a crystalline material that can be
epitaxially grown on III-V heterostructures. The strain of the InGaP layer is
defined via its Ga content when grown on (Al,Ga)As. In our case we realize
devices with a stress of up to 470\,MPa along the $[1\,1\,0]$ crystal
direction. We characterize the mechanical properties of the suspended InGaP
devices, such as anisotropic stress, anisotropic yield strength, and intrinsic
quality factor. We find that the latter degrades over time. We reach mechanical
quality factors surpassing $10^7$ at room temperature with a $Q\cdot f$-product
as high as $7\cdot10^{11}$ with trampoline-shaped micromechanical resonators,
which exploit strain engineering to dilute mechanical dissipation. The large
area of the suspended trampoline resonator allows us to pattern a photonic
crystal to engineer its out-of-plane reflectivity in the telecom band, which is
desired for efficient signal transduction of mechanical motion to light.
Stabilization of the intrinsic quality factor together with a further reduction
of mechanical dissipation through hierarchical clamping or machine
learning-based optimization methods paves the way for integrated free-space
quantum optomechanics at room temperature in a crystalline material platform.

probability that a failure will occur. In safety-critical domains, the failure
probability is extremely small so that the evaluation of a policy through Monte
Carlo sampling is inefficient. Adaptive importance sampling approaches have
been developed for rare event estimation but do not scale well to sequential
systems with long horizons. In this work, we develop two adaptive importance
sampling algorithms that can efficiently estimate the probability of rare
events for sequential decision making systems. The basis for these algorithms
is the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a
state-dependent proposal distribution and a target distribution over
trajectories, but the resulting algorithms resemble policy gradient and
value-based reinforcement learning. We apply multiple importance sampling to
reduce the variance of our estimate and to address the issue of multi-modality
in the optimal proposal distribution. We demonstrate our approach on a control
task with both continuous and discrete actions spaces and show accuracy
improvements over several baselines.

particle diffusing in a three-dimensional (3D) bounded domain containing a set
of small, spherical traps. The boundary surface of each trap is taken to be a
semipermeable membrane. That is, the continuous flux across the interface is
proportional to an associated jump discontinuity in the probability density.
The constant of proportionality is identified with the permeability $\kappa$.
In addition, we allow for discontinuities in the diffusivity and chemical
potential across each interface; the latter introduces a directional bias. We
also assume that the particle can be absorbed (captured) within the interior of
each trap at some Poisson rate $\gamma$. In the small-trap limit, we use
matched asymptotics and Green's function methods to calculate the splitting
probabilities and unconditional MFPT to be absorbed by one of the traps.
However, the details of the analysis depend on how various parameters scale
with the characteristic trap radius $\epsilon$. Under the scalings
$\gamma=O(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $\kappa=O(1/\epsilon)$, we show that the
semipermeable membrane reduces the effective capacitance $\calC$ of each
spherical trap compared to the standard example of totally absorbing traps.
Finally, we consider the unidirectional limit in which each interface only
allows particles to flow into a trap. The traps then act as partially absorbing
surfaces with a constant reaction rate $\kappa$. Combining asymptotic analysis
with the encounter-based formulation of partially reactive surfaces, we show
how a generalized surface absorption mechanism (non-Markovian) can be analyzed
in terms of the capacitances $\calC$. We thus establish that a wide range of
narrow capture problems can be characterized in terms of the effective
capacitances of the traps.

differentiate between high and low confidence, but lack interpretability.
Therefore, they do not provide accurate probabilistic estimates of the

interpretable comparison (PIC) score that accurately reflects the probability
that the score originates from samples of the same identity. We prove that the
proposed approach provides optimal matching confidence. Contrary to other

In the experiments, the proposed PIC approach is compared against all biometric

observing an experimental gap in the ranking of explanation methods between

randomization preserves scales of forward pass activations with high

Minimal positive stencils are obtained through a local $l_1$-type optimization

convergence of the meshfree discretization for linear elliptic equations. A
major theoretical contribution is the existence of consistent and positive
stencils for a given point cloud geometry. We provide sufficient conditions for
the existence of positive stencils by finding neighbors within an ellipse (2d)

Poisson's equation by Seibold in 2008. It is well-known that wide stencils are

schemes for linear elliptic equations. Our result represents a significant

ellipticity constant becomes small), compared to previously known works in this

character insertion, deletion, and substitution, whereas the Hamming distance
only allows substitutions. In many real-life scenarios, insertions and
deletions (abbreviated indels) appear frequently but significantly less so than
substitutions. To model this, we consider substitutions being cheaper than
indels, with cost $1/a$ for a parameter $a\ge 1$. This basic variant, denoted
$ED_a$, bridges classical edit distance ($a=1$) with Hamming distance
($a\to\infty$), leading to interesting algorithmic challenges: Does the time
complexity of computing $ED_a$ interpolate between that of Hamming distance
(linear time) and edit distance (quadratic time)? What about approximating
$ED_a$?
  We first present a simple deterministic exact algorithm for $ED_a$ and
further prove that it is near-optimal assuming the Orthogonal Vectors
Conjecture. Our main result is a randomized algorithm computing a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of $ED_a(X,Y)$, given strings $X,Y$ of total
length $n$ and a bound $k\ge ED_a(X,Y)$. For simplicity, let us focus on $k\ge
1$ and a constant $\epsilon > 0$; then, our algorithm takes $\tilde{O}(n/a +
ak^3)$ time. Unless $a=\tilde{O}(1)$ and for small enough $k$, this running
time is sublinear in $n$. We also consider a very natural version that asks to
find a $(k_I, k_S)$-alignment -- an alignment with at most $k_I$ indels and
$k_S$ substitutions. In this setting, we give an exact algorithm and, more
importantly, an $\tilde{O}(nk_I/k_S + k_S\cdot k_I^3)$-time
$(1,1+\epsilon)$-bicriteria approximation algorithm. The latter solution is
based on the techniques we develop for $ED_a$ for $a=\Theta(k_S / k_I)$. These
bounds are in stark contrast to unit-cost edit distance, where state-of-the-art
algorithms are far from achieving $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in sublinear
time, even for a favorable choice of $k$.

the O3N2 metallicity diagnostic (applied to star-forming regions within a given

diffuse ionised gas (DIG) and low-ionisation nuclear emission regions (LINERs).
We conduct a systematic investigation into possible drivers of the observed
$\nabla Z$ - $t_\mathrm{dep}$ relation (ouflows, gas accretion, in-situ star
formation, mergers, and morphology). We find a strong relation between $\nabla

intense study towards near-term applications on quantum hardware. A crucial
parameter for VQAs is the depth of the variational ansatz used - the smaller
the depth, the more amenable the ansatz is to near-term quantum hardware in
that it gives the circuit a chance to be fully executed before the system
decoheres. This potential for depth reduction has made VQAs a staple of Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era research.
  In this work, we show that approximating the optimal depth for a given VQA
ansatz is intractable. Formally, we show that for any constant $\epsilon>0$, it
is QCMA-hard to approximate the optimal depth of a VQA ansatz within
multiplicative factor $N^{1-\epsilon}$, for $N$ denoting the encoding size of

transitions in the entanglement properties of quantum trajectories conditional
on measurement outcomes. These entanglement transitions are challenging to see
in experiment, as they are invisible to traditional observables like
expectation values (without exponential post-selection overhead). We explore a
modified class of dynamics in which one attempts to (locally) use measurement
outcomes to apply corrective unitaries to steer the system toward a target
state, and study the resulting phase diagram as a function of the measurement
and feedback rates. Steering succeeds when the measurement and feedback rates
exceed a threshold, yielding an observable absorbing-state transition in the
trajectory-averaged density matrix. We argue that the absorbing-state
transition generally occurs at different critical parameters from the
entanglement transition in individual trajectories, and has distinct critical
properties. We study a paradigmatic model targeting a simple product polarized
state. In this model, while the entanglement and absorbing-state transitions
numerically occur at indistinguishable measurement rates (for strong feedback),
we find that the absorbing-state transition is nevertheless in a distinct
directed-percolation universality class -- results we expect to hold generally
in local models targeting short-range correlated states in the absence of
additional symmetries. We also study steering to an entangled cluster state
with SPT order. With parity-symmetry-respecting dynamics, defects can only be
corrected in pairs which requires non-local classical communication. This
limits the efficacy of local feedback and yields widely separated entanglement
and absorbing-state transitions, with the latter now belonging to the
parity-conserving universality class.

that the impact of environment cannot be neglected when modelling chemistry in

resulting vertical extent of both groups. ALMA Band 6 observations of 12CO
emission lines at sufficient velocity and spatial resolution of eight Herbig

height to radius ratio of at least 0.25, and for three of the disks the gas
emission profile can be traced out to 200-500 au. The group II disks are
divided between MWC 480 and HD 163296 which have similar emission height
profiles as the group I disks, and AK Sco and HD 142666 which are very flat
(not exceeding a height of 10 au) and more compact (<200 au in size). The
brightness temperatures show no differences between the disks when the
luminosity of the host star is accounted for. Our findings agree with previous
work suggesting that group I disks are vertically extended and that group II
disks are either large and self-shadowed or compact. Both MWC 480 and HD 163296
could be precursors of group I disks, which we see now before a cavity has
formed that would allow irradiation of the outer parts of the disk. The very
flat disks AK Sco and HD 142666 could be due to significant settling because of
the advanced age of these disks (~20 instead of <10 Myr). These large
differences in vertical structures are not reflected in the spectral energy
distributions of these disks. More and deeper observations at higher spatial
and velocity resolution are necessary to further characterize the Herbig
sub-groups.

While bivariate models should be used to pool data from primary studies in
diagnostic meta-analysis, univariate measures of diagnostic accuracy are
preferable for the purpose of detecting publication bias. In contrast to
earlier research, which focused solely on the diagnostic odds ratio or its
logarithm ($\ln\omega$), the tests are combined with four different univariate
measures of diagnostic accuracy. For each combination of test and univariate
measure, both type I error rate and statistical power are examined under
diverse conditions. The results indicate that tests based on linear regression
or rank correlation cannot be recommended in diagnostic meta-analysis, because
type I error rates are either inflated or power is too low, irrespective of the
applied univariate measure. In contrast, the combination of trim and fill and
$\ln\omega$ has non-inflated or only slightly inflated type I error rates and
medium to high power, even under extreme circumstances (at least when the
number of studies per meta-analysis is large enough). Therefore, we recommend
the application of trim and fill combined with $\ln\omega$ to detect funnel

volumes of spectrahedra, based on the maximum-entropy principle from
statistical physics. The method gives an approximate volume formula based on a
single convex optimization problem of minimizing $-\log \det P$ over the
spectrahedron. Spectrahedra can be described as affine slices of the convex
cone of positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices, and the method yields efficient
deterministic approximation algorithms and asymptotic formulas whenever the
number of affine constraints is sufficiently dominated by the dimension of the
PSD cone.
  Our approach is inspired by the work of Barvinok and Hartigan who used an
analogous framework for approximately computing volumes of polytopes.
Spectrahedra, however, possess a remarkable feature not shared by polytopes, a
new fact that we also prove: central sections of the set of density matrices
(the quantum version of the simplex) all have asymptotically the same volume.
This allows for very general approximation algorithms, which apply to large
classes of naturally occurring spectrahedra.
  We give two main applications of this method. First, we apply this method to
what we call the ""multi-way Birkhoff spectrahedron"" and obtain an explicit
asymptotic formula for its volume. This spectrahedron is the set of quantum
states with maximal entanglement (i.e., the quantum states having univariant
quantum marginals equal to the identity matrix) and is the quantum analog of
the multi-way Birkhoff polytope. Second, we apply this method to explicitly
compute the asymptotic volume of central sections of the set of density
matrices.

for achieving robust autonomy in robots or self-driving vehicles. Training deep
networks to match such scans presents a difficult trade-off: a higher spatial
resolution of the network's intermediate representations is needed to perform
fine-grained matching of subtle geometric features, but growing it too large
makes the memory requirements infeasible. In this work, we propose a
Point-Voxel Transformer network (PVT3D) that achieves robust fine-grained
matching with low memory requirements. It leverages a sparse voxel branch to
extract and aggregate information at a lower resolution and a point-wise branch
to obtain fine-grained local information. A novel hierarchical cross-attention
transformer (HCAT) uses queries from one branch to try to match structures in
the other branch, ensuring that both extract self-contained descriptors of the
point cloud (rather than one branch dominating), but using both to inform the
output global descriptor of the point cloud. Extensive experiments show that
the proposed PVT3D method surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large amount on
several datasets (Oxford RobotCar, TUM, USyd). For instance, we achieve AR@1 of
85.6% on the TUM dataset, which surpasses the strongest prior model by ~15%.

$\log_{10}\xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc})=25.33\pm 0.47$, with a broad
intrinsic scatter 0.42 dex, implying a broad range of galaxy properties and
ages in our UV-faint sample. Galaxies detected with Lyman-alpha have ~0.1 dex
higher $\xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc})$, which is explained by their higher
H-alpha EW distribution, implying younger ages, higher sSFR and thus more O/B
stars. We find significant trends of increasing
$\xi_\mathrm{ion}(1-f_\mathrm{esc})$ with increasing H-alpha EW, decreasing UV
luminosity, and decreasing UV slope, implying the production of ionizing
photons is enhanced in young, low metallicity galaxies. We find no significant
evidence for sources with very high ionizing escape fraction
($f_\mathrm{esc}$>0.5) in our sample, based on their photometric properties,
even amongst the Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. This work demonstrates that
considering the full distribution of $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ across galaxy

estimate the motion during the cardiac cycle. We inform our neural network of
near-incompressibility of cardiac tissue by penalizing the jacobian of the
deformation field. The loss function has two components: an intensity-based
similarity term between the reference and the warped template images, and a
regularizer that represents the hyperelastic behavior of the tissue. The
architecture of the neural network allows us to easily compute the strain via
automatic differentiation to assess cardiac activity. We use Fourier feature
mappings to overcome the spectral bias of neural networks, allowing us to
capture discontinuities in the strain field. We test our algorithm on a
synthetic example and on a cine-MRI benchmark of 15 healthy volunteers. We
outperform current methodologies both landmark tracking and strain estimation.

increase the capacity that is meaningfully used, allowing us to significantly

conductivity of the subsurface can be determined by solving the inverse
problem. For this problem a form of regularisation is required as the forward

adds the $\ell_2$-norm of the model parameters to the objective function. As a
result, a smooth conductivity profile is preferred and these types of
inversions are very stable. However, it can cause problems when the true
profile has discontinuities causing oscillations in the obtained model
parameters. To circumvent this problem, $\ell_0$-approximating norms can be
used to allow discontinuous model parameters. Two of these norms are considered
in this paper, the Minimum Gradient Support and the Cauchy norm. However, both
norms contain a parameter which transforms the function from the $\ell_2$- to
the $\ell_0$-norm. To find the optimal value of this parameter, a new method is
suggested. It is based on the $L$-curve method and finds a good balance between
a continuous and discontinuous profile. The method is tested on synthetic data
and is able to produce a conductivity profile similar to the true profile.
Furthermore, the strategy is applied to newly acquired real-life measurements
and the obtained profiles are in agreement with the results of other surveys at
the same location. Finally, despite the fact that the Cauchy norm is only
occasionally used to the best of our knowledge, we find that it performs at
least as good as the Minimum Gradient Support norm.

Transformer on the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named
Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can

outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and

requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E). Moreover, we show

propose improvements to the two areas by replacing the voxel hash encoding with
a permutohedral lattice which optimizes faster, especially for higher

for recovering high-frequency geometric detail. We evaluate our method on

children, which can be associated with seizures, developmental delay and motor

some cases can be challenging to detect even for experienced radiologists. In
this study, we create an open pediatric MRI dataset (PPMR) with PMG and
controls from the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa,
Canada. The differences between PMG MRIs and control MRIs are subtle and the
true distribution of the features of the disease is unknown. This makes
automatic detection of cases of potential PMG in MRI difficult. We propose an
anomaly detection method based on a novel center-based deep contrastive metric
learning loss function (cDCM) which enables the automatic detection of cases of
potential PMG. Additionally, based on our proposed loss function, we customize
a deep learning model structure that integrates dilated convolution,

  Regression",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the nonparametric multivariate isotonic regression problem, where
the regression function is assumed to be nondecreasing with respect to each
predictor. Our goal is to construct a Bayesian credible interval for the
function value at a given interior point with assured limiting frequentist
coverage. We put a prior on unrestricted step-functions, but make inference
using the induced posterior measure by an ""immersion map"" from the space of
unrestricted functions to that of multivariate monotone functions. This allows
maintaining the natural conjugacy for posterior sampling. A natural immersion
map to use is a projection via a distance, but in the present context, a block
isotonization map is found to be more useful. The approach of using the induced
""immersion posterior"" measure instead of the original posterior to make
inference provides a useful extension of the Bayesian paradigm, particularly
helpful when the model space is restricted by some complex relations. We
establish a key weak convergence result for the posterior distribution of the
function at a point in terms of some functional of a multi-indexed Gaussian
process that leads to an expression for the limiting coverage of the Bayesian
credible interval. Analogous to a recent result for univariate monotone
functions, we find that the limiting coverage is slightly higher than the
credibility, the opposite of a phenomenon observed in smoothing problems.
Interestingly, the relation between credibility and limiting coverage does not
involve any unknown parameter. Hence by a recalibration procedure, we can get a
predetermined asymptotic coverage by choosing a suitable credibility level
smaller than the targeted coverage, and thus also shorten the credible
intervals.

are opposite to expectations for a single massive, ancient merger event, and
multiple chemical evolution paths with distinct dynamics are present. We use a
Bayesian Gaussian mixture model regression algorithm to characterize the local
stellar halo, and find that the data is best fit by a model with four
components. We interpret these components as the VRM, Cronus, Nereus, and
Thamnos; however, Nereus and Thamnos likely represent more than one accretion

contain many peaks. Although the Cronus and Thamnos components have different

the distinct low and high alpha halo populations from Nissen & Schuster (2010)
are explained by VRM and Cronus stars, as well as some in-situ stars. Because
the local stellar halo contains multiple substructures, different popular
methods of selecting GSE stars will actually select different mixtures of these
substructures, which may change the apparent chemodynamic properties of the

execution involves traversing an exponential-sized tree. Examples of such
problems include proving unsatisfiability of a SAT formula; counting the number
of solutions of a satisfiable SAT formula; and finding the optimal solution to
a mixed-integer program. MCFS algorithms can be seen as extensions of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to cases where, rather than finding a good path
(solution) within a tree, the problem is to find a small tree within a forest
of candidate trees. We instantiate and evaluate our ideas in an algorithm that
we dub Knuth Synthesis, an MCFS algorithm that learns DPLL branching policies
for solving the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, with the objective of
achieving good average-case performance on a given distribution of
unsatisfiable problem instances. Knuth Synthesis leverages two key ideas to
avoid the prohibitive costs of policy evaluations in an exponentially-sized
tree. First, we estimate tree size by randomly sampling paths and measuring
their lengths, drawing on an unbiased approximation due to Knuth (1975).
Second, we query a strong solver at a user-defined depth rather than learning a
policy across the whole tree, to focus our policy search on early decisions
that offer the greatest potential for reducing tree size. We matched or
improved performance over a strong baseline on three well-known SAT
distributions (R3SAT, sgen, satfc).

identification of regions and population groups distinguished by race and

are disaggregated by race and ethnicity and population size data derived from
the US Census Bureau. The goal is to present timely data-driven information in
a manner that is accessible to the general population, is relatable to the
constituents and promotes community engagement in managing and mitigating the
infections. A statistical metric referred to as the rank difference and its
persistence over time is used to capture the disproportional incidence of
Covid-19 positive cases on particular race and ethnic groups in relation to
their population size. A persistence index is derived to identify regions that
continually exhibit positive rank differences on a daily time scale and
indicate disparity in disease incidence. The analysis leads to the
identification that several municipalities in Wisconsin that are located in
regions of low population and away from the denser urban centers are those that
continue to exhibit disparity in the infection rates for Black/African American

data methods to properly exploit them towards developing applications for
sustainable and resilient agriculture. The thesis addresses three distinct
thematic areas, i.e., the monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),
the monitoring of food security and applications for smart and resilient
agriculture. The methodological innovations of the developments related to the
three thematic areas address the following issues: i) the processing of big
Earth Observation (EO) data, ii) the scarcity of annotated data for machine
learning model training and iii) the gap between machine learning outputs and
actionable advice.
  This thesis demonstrated how big data technologies such as data cubes,
distributed learning, linked open data and semantic enrichment can be used to
exploit the data deluge and extract knowledge to address real user needs.
Furthermore, this thesis argues for the importance of semi-supervised and
unsupervised machine learning models that circumvent the ever-present challenge
of scarce annotations and thus allow for model generalization in space and
time. Specifically, it is shown how merely few ground truth data are needed to
generate high quality crop type maps and crop phenology estimations. Finally,
this thesis argues there is considerable distance in value between model
inferences and decision making in real-world scenarios and thereby showcases
the power of causal and interpretable machine learning in bridging this gap.

that the behaviour of GCRN couplings does not break down with the ellipticity

Although a broad spectrum of research of such issues exists in various fields
of study, events have extensive applicability in computing (e.g., event-driven
programming, architecture, data modeling, automation, and surveillance). While
these computing notions are diverse, their event-based nature lets us apply
many of the same software engineering techniques to all of them. In this paper,
the focus is on addressing the dynamic concepts of system events and negative
events. Specifically, we concentrate on what computer scientists would refer to
as an event grammar and event calculus. Analyzing the concept of event would
further the understanding of the event notion and provide a sound foundation
for improving the theory and practice of conceptual modeling. An event in
computer science has many definitions (e.g., anything that happens, changes in
the properties of objects, and the occurrence of and transition between
states). This paper is based upon a different conceptualization using thinging
machines and Lupascian logic to define negative events. An event is defined as
a time penetrated domain s region, which is described in terms of things and
five-action machines. Accordingly, samples from event grammar and event
calculus are remodeled and analyzed in terms of this definition. The results
point to an enriched modeling technique with an enhanced conceptualization of

to perform speech separation in a car environment with reduced computation cost

framework uses a mel-scale based subband selection strategy which ensures a
fine-grained processing for lower frequencies where most speech formant

a recursive way, robust frame-level beamforming weights are determined for each
speaker location/zone in a car from the estimated subband speech and noise
covariance matrices. Furthermore, proposed framework also estimates and
suppresses any echoes from the loudspeaker(s) by using the echo reference

marginal maximum likelihood estimate or is equipped with an inverse-gamma
prior. Then the unrestricted block heights are a posteriori also independently

increasing distance from the source. The [Fe II] and Pa$\beta$ emission line
intensity ratio gives a velocity jump through each knot of 40--50 km/s. A new
[O I] 63 \mic\ spectrum, taken with the German REciever for Astronomy at
Terahertz frequencies (GREAT) instrument aboard Stratospheric Observatory for
Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), shows a low line-of-sight velocity indicative of
high jet inclination. Proper motions and jump velocities then estimate 3D flow
speed for knots. Subsequently, we model knot positions and speeds with a
precessing jet that decelerates. Measurements are matched with a precession
period of 1,000--3,000 years and half opening angle of $15^\circ$. The [Fe II]
1.26-to-1.64 \mic\ line intensity ratio determines visual extinction to each
knot from 5--30 mag. Relative to $\sim$14 mag of extinction through the cloud
from $\rm{C}^{18}$O emission maps, the jet is embedded at a 1/5 to 4/5
fractional cloud depth. Our model suggests the jet is dissipated over a 0.2 pc
arc. This short distance may result from the jet sweeping through a wide angle,
allowing the cloud time to fill cavities opened by the jet. Precessing jets
contrast with nearly unidirectional protostellar jets that puncture host clouds
and can propagate significantly further.

in normal, or in shallow pipeline mode, thus balancing the execution time in
cycles and the operating clock frequency. By selecting the appropriate pipeline
configuration per CNN layer, ArrayFlex reduces the inference latency of
state-of-the-art CNNs by 11%, on average, as compared to a traditional
fixed-pipeline systolic array. Most importantly, this result is achieved while
using 13%-23% less power, for the same applications, thus offering a combined
energy-delay-product efficiency between 1.4x and 1.8x.

complicated factors, e.g., scenarios that involve complex decision making, the
linear paradigm of classical random walks lack the ability to capture
dynamically rich behaviors. One modification that addresses this issue is to
allow transition probabilities to depend on the current system state, resulting
in a nonlinear random walk. While the resulting nonlinearity has been shown to
give rise to an array of more complex dynamics, the patterns that emerge, in
particular on regular network topologies, remain unexplored and poorly
understood. Here we study nonlinear random walks on regular networks. We
present a number of stability results for the uniform state where random
walkers are uniformly distributed throughout the network, characterizing the
spectral properties of its Jacobian which we use to characterize its
bifurcations. These spectral properties may also be used to understand the
patterns that emerge beyond bifurcations, which consist of oscillating short
wave-length patterns and localized structures for negative and positive bias,
respectively. We also uncover a subcriticality in the bifurcation for positive
bias, leading to a hysteresis loop and multistability.

questions related to Chemical Reaction Networks; given two configurations, can
one reach the other according to the system's rules? With no restrictions,
reachability was recently shown to be Ackermann-complete, this resolving a
decades-old problem.
  Here, we fully characterize monotone reachability problems based on various
restrictions such as the rule size, the number of rules that may create a
species (k-source) or consume a species (k-consuming), the volume, and whether
the rules have an acyclic production order (feed-forward). We show
PSPACE-completeness of reachability with only bimolecular reactions with
two-source and two-consuming rules. This proves hardness of reachability in
Population Protocols, which was unknown. Further, this shows reachability in
CRNs is PSPACE-complete with size-2 rules, which was previously only known with
size-5 rules. This is achieved using techniques within the motion planning

  We provide many important results for feed-forward CRNs where rules are
single-source or single-consuming. We show that reachability is solvable in
polynomial time if the system does not contain special void or autogenesis
rules. We then fully characterize all systems of this type and show that if you

($\sim$\SI{119}{\micro\metre}) achieved a resolution of 45\,ps in timing single
photons in laser beam tests (in comparison to 76\,ps of the standard PICOSEC
detector). Towards large area detectors, multi-pad PICOSEC prototypes with
segmented anodes has been developed and studied. Extensive tests in particle
beams revealed that the multi-pad PICOSEC technology provides also very precise
timing, even when the induced signal is shared among several neighbouring pads.
Furthermore, new signal processing algorithms have been developed, which can be
applied during data acquisition and provide real time, precise timing.

  regions and potentialities of the 'just transition'",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The United States, much like other countries around the world, faces
significant obstacles to achieving a rapid decarbonization of its economy.
Crucially, decarbonization disproportionately affects the communities that have
been historically, politically, and socially embedded in the nation's fossil
fuel production. However, this effect has rarely been quantified in the
literature. Using econometric estimation methods that control for unobserved
heterogeneity via two-way fixed effects, spatial effects, heterogeneous time
trends, and grouped fixed effects, we demonstrate that mine closures induce a
significant and consistent contemporaneous rise in the unemployment rate across
US counties. A single mine closure can raise a county's unemployment rate by
0.056 percentage points in a given year; this effect is amplified by a factor
of four when spatial econometric dynamics are considered. Although this
response in the unemployment rate fades within 2-3 years, it has far-reaching
effects in its immediate vicinity. Furthermore, we use cluster analysis to
build a novel typology of coal counties based on qualities that are thought to
facilitate a successful recovery in the face of local industrial decline. The
combined findings of the econometric analysis and typology point to the
importance of investing in alternative sectors in places with promising levels
of economic diversity, retraining job seekers in places with lower levels of
educational attainment, providing relocation (or telecommuting) support in
rural areas, and subsidizing childcare and after school programs in places with
low female labor force participation due to the gendered division of domestic
work.

Threshold-based auto-labeling, where validation data obtained from humans is

machine-labeled, is emerging as a popular solution used widely in practice.
Given the long shelf-life and diverse usage of the resulting datasets,
understanding when the data obtained by such auto-labeling systems can be

Our results provide two insights. First, reasonable chunks of the unlabeled

Second, a hidden downside of threshold-based auto-labeling systems is
potentially prohibitive validation data usage. Together, these insights

sufficient number of full pseudorange measurements to obtain a position

from only the satellite broadcast signals due to the navigation data features
of GNSS. In order to realize fast positioning during a cold or warm start in a
GNSS receiver, the existing approaches require an initial estimation of
position and time or require a number of computational steps to recover the
full pseudorange information from fractional pseudoranges and then compute the
position solution. The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) has a unique
constellation distribution and a fast navigation data rate for geostationary

fast positioning technique for BDS receivers. It simultaneously processes the
full and fractional pseudorange measurements from the BDS GEOs and non-GEOs,
respectively, which is faster than processing all full measurements. This
method resolves the position solution and recovers the full pseudoranges for
non-GEOs simultaneously within 1 s theoretically and does not need an estimate

suffer from rapid variations in atmospheric opacity that directly affect the
system temperature $T_{sys}$. Current observations perform discrete atmospheric
calibrations (Atm-cals) every few minutes, with typically 10-20 occurring per
hour for high frequency observation and each taking 30-40 seconds. In order to
obtain more accurate flux measurements and reduce the number of atmospheric
calibrations (Atm-cals), a new method to monitor $T_{sys}$ continuously is
proposed using existing data in the measurement set. In this work, we
demonstrate the viability of using water vapor radiometer (WVR) data to track
the $T_{sys}$ continuously. We find a tight linear correlation between
$T_{sys}$ measured using the traditional method and $T_{sys}$ extrapolated
based on WVR data with scatter of 0.5-3%. Although the exact form of the linear
relation varies among different data sets and spectral windows, we can use a
small number of discrete $T_{sys}$ measurements to fit the linear relation and
use this heuristic relationship to derive $T_{sys}$ every 10 seconds.
Furthermore, we successfully reproduce the observed correlation using
atmospheric transmission at microwave (ATM) modeling and demonstrate the
viability of a more general method to directly derive the $T_{sys}$ from the
modeling. We apply the semi-continuous $T_{sys}$ from heuristic fitting on a
few data sets from Band 7 to Band 10 and compare the flux measured using these
methods. We find the discrete and continuous $T_{sys}$ methods give us
consistent flux measurements with differences up to 5%. Furthermore, this

PAC-Bayesian learning to the geometry of the robust loss surface through a

that hot carriers generated after plasmon excitation transfer back and forth
between Au$_{20}$ and CO. Meanwhile, the C-O stretching mode is activated due

cooperative consensus formation with their one-hop neighbors over the
decentralized underlying physical network. We further eliminate the need for a
timing coordinator by introducing asynchronous, event-triggered communications

heterogeneity challenges in FL, we define personalized communication triggering
conditions at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters
against the available local resources. We theoretically demonstrate that our

$O{(\frac{\ln{k}}{\sqrt{k}})}$ rate under standard assumptions in distributed

  Communications: A Deep Learning Approach","30 pages, 14 figures, journal paper",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beamforming design for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted
multi-user communication (IRS-MUC) systems critically depends on the
acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI). However, channel
estimation (CE) in IRS-MUC systems causes a large signaling overhead for
training due to the large number of IRS elements. In this paper, taking into
account user mobility, we adopt a deep learning (DL) approach to implicitly
learn the historical line-of-sight (LoS) channel features and predict the IRS
phase shifts to be adopted for the next time slot for maximization of the
weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the IRS-MUC system. With the proposed predictive
approach, we can avoid full-scale CSI estimation and facilitate low-dimensional
CE for transmit beamforming design such that the signaling overhead is reduced
by a scale of $\frac{1}{N}$, where $N$ is the number of IRS elements. To this
end, we first develop a universal DL-based predictive beamforming (DLPB)
framework featuring a two-stage predictive-instantaneous beamforming mechanism.
As a realization of the developed framework, a location-aware convolutional
long short-term memory (CLSTM) graph neural network (GNN) is developed to
facilitate effective predictive beamforming at the IRS, where a CLSTM module is
first adopted to exploit the spatial and temporal features of the considered
channels and a GNN is then applied to empower the designed neural network with
high scalability and generalizability. Furthermore, in the second stage, based
on the predicted IRS phase shifts, an instantaneous CSI-aware fully-connected
neural network is designed to optimize the transmit beamforming at the access
point. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only
achieves a better WSR performance and requires a lower CE overhead compared
with state-of-the-art benchmarks, but also is highly scalable in the numbers of
users.

performance level of many state-of-the-art sensors (e.g., mass, force,
temperature, radiation) that relate an external physical perturbation to a
resonance frequency shift. While this is obviously of fundamental importance,
accurate models and understandings of sources of frequency instability are not
always available. The contribution of thermomechanical noise to frequency
stability has been well studied in recent years and is often the fundamental
performance limitation. Frequency stability limited by thermal fluctuation
noise has attracted less interest but is nevertheless of fundamental importance
notably in temperature sensing applications. In particular,
temperature-sensitive NMR have become promising candidates for replacing
traditional bolometers in infrared radiation sensing. However, reaching the
ultimate detectivity limit of thermal radiation sensors requires their noise to
be dominated by fundamental thermal fluctuation, which has not been
demonstrated to date. In this work, we first develop a theoretical model for
computing the frequency stability of NMR by considering the effect of both
additive phase noise (i.e., thermomechanical, and experimental detection noise)
and thermal fluctuation noise in a close-loop frequency tracking scheme. We
thereafter validate this model experimentally and observe thermal fluctuation
noise in SiN drum resonators of various sizes. Our work shows that by using
resonators of specific characteristics--such as high temperature sensitivity,
high mechanical quality factors, and high mass-to-thermal-conductance
ratio--one can minimize additive phase noise below thermal fluctuation noise.
This paves the way for NMR-based radiation sensors that can reach the
fundamental detectivity limit of thermal radiation sensing and outperform
existing technologies.

manipulation of the Q factors of BIC resonances enables full control of
interaction behavior as well as both near- and far-field light engineering. In
this paper, we harness reflection symmetry (RS) and translational symmetry (TS)
protected BIC resonances supported in an asymmetric dimer lattice and
investigate Q-factor-mediated resonance coupling behavior under controlled TS

magnetic dipole BIC (MD-BIC) which are protected by RS, and out-of-plane
electrical dipole BIC (EDo-BIC) protected by TS. The coupling between EDi-BIC
and EDo-BIC exhibits a resonance crossing behavior where the transmission
spectrum at the crossing could be tuned flexibly, showing an
electromagnetically induced transparency lineshape or satisfying the lattice
Kerker condition with pure phase modulation capability depending on TS and RS
perturbed Q factors. While the coupling between MD-BIC and EDo-BIC shows an
avoided resonance crossing behavior, where the strongly coupled resonances
would lead to the formation of a Friedrich-Wintgen BICs whose spectral position
could also be shifted by tuning the Q factors. Our results suggest an
intriguing platform to explore BIC resonance interactions with independent Q

of the COSMOS field at $1<z<4$. In contrast to other studies of dusty galaxies,
we select our sample based on dust attenuation measured by UV-MIR spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling that allows for extreme attenuation levels.
We construct our sample by making cuts at $1 \le z \le 4$, A$_V \ge 3$, and
log(M$_*$/M$_\odot$)$ \ge 10.5$. This method reliably selects galaxies
exhibiting independent indicators of significant dust content, including FIR
detection rates. We perform panchromatic SED modeling with matched $Herschel$
photometry and find stellar and dust properties that differ from typical
sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG) samples as well as $Herschel$ sources matched in
redshift and stellar mass. Our sources have lower star formation rates and
higher A$_V$ than SMGs, but comparable total IR luminosities. Most of our
sample falls on or near the star-forming main sequence for this redshift range.
Finally, we perform a morphological analysis with GALFIT using the $K_S$-band
images and $Hubble$ $F814W$ and $F160W$ imaging when available. Typical axis
ratios of $\sim 0.4$ suggest disk-like morphology for the majority of our

agrees with the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies, with a tail
extending to smaller sizes. We conclude that the most heavily obscured galaxies

near-side observations. It is therefore both feasible and useful to estimate
the far-side magnetic-flux maps using the far-side helioseismic images despite
their relatively low spatial resolution and large uncertainties. In this work,
we train two machine-learning models to achieve this goal. The first
machine-learning training pairs simultaneous SDO/HMI-observed magnetic-flux
maps and SDO/AIA-observed EUV 304$\r{A}$ images, and the resulting model can
convert 304$\r{A}$ images into magnetic-flux maps. This model is then applied
on the STEREO/EUVI-observed far-side 304$\r{A}$ images, available for about 4.3
years, for the far-side magnetic-flux maps. These EUV-converted magnetic-flux
maps are then paired with simultaneous far-side helioseismic images for a
second machine-learning training, and the resulting model can convert far-side
helioseismic images into magnetic-flux maps. These helioseismically derived
far-side magnetic-flux maps, despite their limitations in spatial resolution
and accuracy, can be routinely available on a daily basis, providing useful
magnetic information on the Sun's far side using only the near-side

the SRM beamforming, we prove that the optimal beamformer can be computed in

between source and driving faces. Specifically, the suboptimally disentangled

this paper proposes to use 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) for explicit facial
semantic decomposition and identity disentanglement. Instead of using 3D
coefficients alone for re-enactment control, we take the advantage of the
generative ability of 3DMM to render textured face proxies. These proxies
contain abundant yet compact geometric and semantic information of human faces,
which enable us to compute the face motion field between source and driving
images by estimating the dense correspondence. In this way, we could
approximate re-enactment results by warping source images according to the
motion field, and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is adopted to further
improve the visual quality of warping results. Extensive experiments on various

collapse simulations are carried out in 2D to nearly 3 s post-bounce and show
substantial differences in the times of shock revival and explosion energies.
The 15.78 $M_\odot$ model explodes promptly at 120 ms post-bounce when a strong
density decrement at the Si--Si/O shell interface encounters the stalled shock.
The 15.79 $M_\odot$ model, which lacks the density decrement, takes 100 ms
longer to explode but ultimately produces a more powerful explosion. Larger
mass accretion rate of the 15.79 $M_\odot$ model during the first 0.8 s
post-bounce results in larger $\nu_{e}$/$\bar \nu_{e}$ luminosities and rms
energies. The $\nu_{e}$/$\bar \nu_{e}$ luminosities and rms energies arising
from the inner core are also larger in the 15.79 $M_\odot$ model throughout due
to the larger negative temperature gradient of this core due to greater
adiabatic compression. Larger luminosities and rms energies in the 15.79
$M_\odot$ model and a flatter and higher density heating region, result in more
energy deposition behind the shock and more ejected matter with higher
enthalpy. We find the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass of the 15.79 $M_\odot$ model is
more than double that of the 15.78 $M_\odot$ model. Most of the ejecta in both
models is moderately proton-rich, though counterintuitively the highest
electron fraction ($Y_e=0.61$) ejecta in either model is in the less energetic

the trade-off between vocabulary size, number of parameters, and performance.
However, sub-word tokenization still has disadvantages like not being robust to
noise and difficult to generalize to new languages. Also, the current trend of
scaling up models reveals that larger models require larger embeddings but that
makes parallelization hard. Previous work on image classification proves
splitting raw input into a sequence of chucks is a strong, model-agnostic
inductive bias. Based on this observation, we rethink the existing
character-aware method that takes character-level inputs but makes word-level
sequence modeling and prediction. We overhaul this method by introducing a
cross-attention network that builds word-level representation directly from
bytes, and a sub-word level prediction based on word-level hidden states to
avoid the time and space requirement of word-level prediction. With these two
improvements combined, we have a token free model with slim input embeddings
for downstream tasks. We name our method Byte2Word and perform evaluations on
language modeling and text classification. Experiments show that Byte2Word is
on par with the strong sub-word baseline BERT but only takes up 10\% of
embedding size. We further test our method on synthetic noise and cross-lingual
transfer and find it competitive to baseline methods on both settings.

applications in different fields. An existing common practice for solving
regression problems is the mean square error (MSE) minimization approach or its
regularized variants which require prior knowledge about the models. Recently,
Yi et al., proposed a mutual information based supervised learning framework
where they introduced a label entropy regularization which does not require any
prior knowledge. When applied to classification tasks and solved via a
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, their approach
achieved significant improvement over the commonly used cross entropy loss and
its variants. However, they did not provide a theoretical convergence analysis
of the SGD algorithm for the proposed formulation. Besides, applying the
framework to regression tasks is nontrivial due to the potentially infinite
support set of the label. In this paper, we investigate the regression under
the mutual information based supervised learning framework. We first argue that
the MSE minimization approach is equivalent to a conditional entropy learning
problem, and then propose a mutual information learning formulation for solving
regression problems by using a reparameterization technique. For the proposed
formulation, we give the convergence analysis of the SGD algorithm for solving
it in practice. Finally, we consider a multi-output regression data model where
we derive the generalization performance lower bound in terms of the mutual
information associated with the underlying data distribution. The result shows
that the high dimensionality can be a bless instead of a curse, which is
controlled by a threshold. We hope our work will serve as a good starting point

tasks. We first show that under some natural assumptions, no delay mechanism
can provide a meaningful differential privacy guarantee. We therefore propose a
""one-sided"" formulation of differential privacy for protecting against linkage
attacks. We design a mechanism that adds zero-inflated uniform delay to events
and show it can preserve privacy. We prove that this noise distribution is in
fact optimal in minimizing expected delay among mechanisms adding independent
noise to each event, thereby establishing the Pareto frontier of the trade-off
between the expected delay for batched and unbatched events. Finally, we
conduct a series of experiments on Wikipedia and Bitcoin data that corroborate
the practical utility of our algorithm in obfuscating batching without
introducing onerous delay to a system.

Namely, its code mode is still free from global phase randomization and
postselection to make sure the advantage of the high key rate remains. On other

aims to find data-driven estimators to compete with the Bayesian oracle that
knows the true prior. Two principled approaches to EB estimation have emerged
over the years: $f$-modeling, which constructs an approximate Bayes rule by
estimating the marginal distribution of the data, and $g$-modeling, which
estimates the prior from data and then applies the learned Bayes rule. For the
Poisson model, the prototypical examples are the celebrated Robbins estimator
and the nonparametric MLE (NPMLE), respectively. It has long been recognized in
practice that the Robbins estimator, while being conceptually appealing and
computationally simple, lacks robustness and can be easily derailed by
""outliers"" (data points that were rarely observed before), unlike the NPMLE
which provides more stable and interpretable fit thanks to its Bayes form. On
the other hand, not only do the existing theories shed little light on this
phenomenon, but they all point to the opposite, as both methods have recently
been shown optimal in terms of the \emph{regret} (excess over the Bayes risk)
for compactly supported and subexponential priors with exact logarithmic
factors.
  In this paper we provide a theoretical justification for the superiority of
NPMLE over Robbins for heavy-tailed data by considering priors with bounded
$p$th moment previously studied for the Gaussian model. For the Poisson model
with sample size $n$, assuming $p>1$ (for otherwise triviality arises), we show
that the NPMLE with appropriate regularization and truncation achieves a total
regret $\tilde \Theta(n^{\frac{3}{2p+1}})$, which is minimax optimal within
logarithmic factors. In contrast, the total regret of Robbins estimator (with
similar truncation) is $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{\frac{3}{p+2}})$ and hence suboptimal
by a polynomial factor.

4-dimensional (4D) space-time invoking the framework of 5D SU(2) gauge theory.
By the sphaleron-like solution we mean a static finite energy solution to the
equation of motion, which carries the Chern-Simons number
$N_\text{CS}=\frac{1}{2}$. Since we are interested in the static solution in
the low-energy effective theory, we focus on the part of the action which
contains only the gauge fields in the 4D space (not space-time), $(A_{i},
A_{y}) (i = 1,2,3)$ and keep only the Kaluza-Klein zero modes of these fields.
Interestingly, the self-duality condition in this 4D space is known to be
nothing but the BPS condition for the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, once the
extra-space component $A_y$ is identified with the adjoint scalar, needed for
the monopole solution. Thus, the sphaleron-like solution is based on the BPS
monopole embedded in the higher dimensional space-time, which may be
interpreted as a self-dual gauge field. By use of the lesson we learn in the
case of the instanton in ordinary 4D space-time, we achieve the sphaleron-like
configuration of $A_{i}$, which carries $N_\text{CS} = \frac{1}{2}$. As a
characteristic feature of this construction invoking higher dimensional gauge
theory, in clear contrast to the case of the ordinary BPS monopole, the VEV of
the adjoint scalar is topologically fixed, and therefore the mass of the
sphaleron-like solution is determined to be $M_\text{sp} =
\frac{4\pi}{g_{4}^{2}}\frac{1}{R}$ ($g_{4}$: 4D gauge coupling constant, $R$:
the radius of the circle as the extra space). We also argue that the
sphaleron-like solution may be regarded as a saddle point of the energy in the
space of static field configurations.

an iterative presolve algorithm to compute a feasible but possibly suboptimal
MIQP solution. We present benchmarking results for a C code implementation of

In this work, we address this gap in the context of tabular data, where
sensitive subgroups are clearly-defined, real-world fairness problems abound,
and prior works often do not compare to state-of-the-art tree-based models as
baselines. We conduct an empirical comparison of several previously-proposed
methods for fair and robust learning alongside state-of-the-art tree-based
methods and other baselines. Via experiments with more than $340{,}000$ model
configurations on eight datasets, we show that tree-based methods have strong
subgroup robustness, even when compared to robustness- and fairness-enhancing
methods. Moreover, the best tree-based models tend to show good performance
over a range of metrics, while robust or group-fair models can show
brittleness, with significant performance differences across different metrics
for a fixed model. We also demonstrate that tree-based models show less
sensitivity to hyperparameter configurations, and are less costly to train. Our
work suggests that tree-based ensemble models make an effective baseline for
tabular data, and are a sensible default when subgroup robustness is desired.

algorithm for uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output
(CF-mMIMO) networks without channel hardening assumption. Extensive studies
have done on the joint optimization problem assuming the channel hardening.
However, it has been reported that the channel hardening may not be validated
in some CF-mMIMO environments. In particular, the existing Use-and-then-Forget
(UatF) bound based on the channel hardening often seriously underestimates user
rates in CF-mMIMO. Therefore, a new performance evaluation technique without
resorting to the channel hardening is indispensable for accurate performance
estimations. Motivated by this, we propose a new bound on the achievable rate
of uplink CF-mMIMO. It is demonstrated that the proposed bound provides a more
accurate performance estimate of CF-mMIMO than that of the existing UatF bound.
The proposed bound also enables us to develop a joint power control and APs
scheduling algorithm targeting at both improving fairness and reducing the
resource between APs and a central processing unit (CPU). We conduct extensive
performance evaluations and comparisons for systems designed with the proposed
and existing algorithms. The comparisons show that a considerable performance
improvement is achievable with the proposed algorithm even at reduced resource
between APs and CPU.

  Conference (APSEC 2022)",,,,"cs.SE cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Today, machine learning (ML) is widely used in industry to provide the core
functionality of production systems. However, it is practically always used in
production systems as part of a larger end-to-end software system that is made
up of several other components in addition to the ML model. Due to production
demand and time constraints, automated software engineering practices are
highly applicable. The increased use of automated ML software engineering
practices in industries such as manufacturing and utilities requires an
automated Quality Assurance (QA) approach as an integral part of ML software.
Here, QA helps reduce risk by offering an objective perspective on the software
task. Although conventional software engineering has automated tools for QA
data analysis for data-driven ML, the use of QA practices for ML in operation
(MLOps) is lacking. This paper examines the QA challenges that arise in
industrial MLOps and conceptualizes modular strategies to deal with data
integrity and Data Quality (DQ). The paper is accompanied by real industrial
use-cases from industrial partners. The paper also presents several challenges
that may serve as a basis for future studies.

  Humans?","AAAI-23 Workshop on Knowledge Augmented Methods for NLP",,,,"cs.CL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent state-of-the-art open-domain QA models are typically based on a two
stage retriever-reader approach in which the retriever first finds the relevant
knowledge/passages and the reader then leverages that to predict the answer.
Prior work has shown that the performance of the reader usually tends to
improve with the increase in the number of these passages. Thus,
state-of-the-art models use a large number of passages (e.g. 100) for
inference. While the reader in this approach achieves high prediction
performance, its inference is computationally very expensive. We humans, on the
other hand, use a more efficient strategy while answering: firstly, if we can
confidently answer the question using our already acquired knowledge then we do
not even use the external knowledge, and in the case when we do require
external knowledge, we don't read the entire knowledge at once, instead, we
only read that much knowledge that is sufficient to find the answer. Motivated
by this procedure, we ask a research question ""Can the open-domain QA reader
utilize external knowledge efficiently like humans without sacrificing the
prediction performance?""
  Driven by this question, we explore an approach that utilizes both
'closed-book' (leveraging knowledge already present in the model parameters)
and 'open-book' inference (leveraging external knowledge). Furthermore, instead
of using a large fixed number of passages for open-book inference, we
dynamically read the external knowledge in multiple 'knowledge iterations'.
Through comprehensive experiments on NQ and TriviaQA datasets, we demonstrate
that this dynamic reading approach improves both the 'inference efficiency' and
the 'prediction accuracy' of the reader. Comparing with the FiD reader, this
approach matches its accuracy by utilizing just 18.32% of its reader inference
cost and also outperforms it by achieving up to 55.10% accuracy on NQ Open.

decentralized policies in the presence of only global rewards, and has recently
emerged as a powerful credit assignment paradigm for tackling cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. One of the main challenges
in VD is to promote diverse behaviors among agents, while existing methods
directly encourage the diversity of learned agent networks with various
strategies. However, we argue that these dedicated designs for agent networks
are still limited by the indistinguishable VD network, leading to homogeneous
agent behaviors and thus downgrading the cooperation capability. In this paper,
we propose a novel Contrastive Identity-Aware learning (CIA) method, explicitly
boosting the credit-level distinguishability of the VD network to break the
bottleneck of multi-agent diversity. Specifically, our approach leverages
contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information between the temporal
credits and identity representations of different agents, encouraging the full
expressiveness of credit assignment and further the emergence of
individualities. The algorithm implementation of the proposed CIA module is
simple yet effective that can be readily incorporated into various VD

approach for automatically constructing AEs. In brief, AutoAE repeatedly adds
the attack and its iteration steps to the ensemble that maximizes ensemble
improvement per additional iteration consumed. We show theoretically that
AutoAE yields AEs provably within a constant factor of the optimal for a given

defenses on the RobustBench leaderboard. In all except one cases we achieve
equal or better (often the latter) robustness evaluation than existing AEs, and
notably, in 29 cases we achieve better robustness evaluation than the best

structure during ongoing learning in response to dynamically changing
environments. However, the existing network compression methods for deep
artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) draw
little inspiration from the brain's developmental plasticity mechanisms, thus
limiting their ability to learn efficiently, rapidly, and accurately. This
paper proposed a developmental plasticity-inspired adaptive pruning (DPAP)
method, with inspiration from the adaptive developmental pruning of dendritic
spines, synapses, and neurons according to the ""use it or lose it, gradually
decay"" principle. The proposed DPAP model considers multiple biologically
realistic mechanisms (such as dendritic spine dynamic plasticity,
activity-dependent neural spiking trace, and local synaptic plasticity), with
the addition of an adaptive pruning strategy, so that the network structure can
be dynamically optimized during learning without any pre-training and
retraining. We demonstrated that the proposed DPAP method applied to deep ANNs
and SNNs could learn efficient network architectures. Extensive comparative
experiments show consistent and remarkable performance and speed boost with the
extremely compressed networks on a diverse set of benchmark tasks, especially
neuromorphic datasets for SNNs. This work explores how developmental plasticity
enables the complex deep networks to gradually evolve into brain-like efficient
and compact structures, eventually achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance for biologically realistic SNNs.

compression in text classification tasks. The key purpose of this method is to
evaluate the importance of each keyword in the dictionary. To this end, we
first train a pre-specified recurrent neural network-based model using a full
dictionary. This leads to a benchmark model, which we then use to obtain the
predicted class probabilities for each sample in a dataset. Next, to evaluate
the impact of each keyword in affecting the predicted class probabilities, we
develop a novel method for assessing the importance of each keyword in a
dictionary. Consequently, each keyword can be screened, and only the most
important keywords are reserved. With these screened keywords, a new dictionary
with a considerably reduced size can be constructed. Accordingly, the original
text sequence can be substantially compressed. The proposed method leads to
significant reductions in terms of parameters, average text sequence, and
dictionary size. Meanwhile, the prediction power remains very competitive
compared to the benchmark model. Extensive numerical studies are presented to
demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed method.

non-discriminative information, and the contextual dependency among the
localized regions is often ignored or over-simplified. This paper builds a
unified framework to perform effective noisy-proposal suppression and to
interact between global and local features for robust feature learning.
Specifically, we propose category-aware weak supervision to concentrate on
non-existent categories so as to provide deterministic information for local
feature learning, restricting the local branch to focus on more high-quality
regions of interest. Moreover, we develop a cross-granularity attention module
to explore the complementary information between global and local features,

global-to-local, but also local-to-local relations. Both advantages guarantee a
boost in the performance of the whole network. Extensive experiments on two

view on the astronomical data sonification paradigm that allowed to observe
either the diversity of tools, uses and users (including visually-impaired

launched magnetically from such flows, we insert a large-scale poloidal
magnetic field into the accretion flow and consider a rapidly spinning black

initially have specific angular momentum above a certain threshold to
eventually reach and robustly sustain the magnetically arrested disk state. If
the flow can reach such a state, it can launch very powerful jets at $\gtrsim
100\%$ energy efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that even when the
accretion flow has initial specific angular momentum below the threshold, it
can still launch episodic jets with an average energy efficiency of $\sim
10\%$. However, the accretion flow has nontypical behaviors such as having
different rotation directions at different inclinations and exhibiting
persistent outflows along the midplane even in the inner disk region. Our
results give plausible explanations as to why jets can be produced from various
astrophysical systems that likely lack large gas specific angular momenta, such
as Sgr A*, wind-fed X-ray binaries, tidal disruption events, and long-duration

  Self-supervised Decoding",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semantic communications can reduce the resource consumption by transmitting
task-related semantic information extracted from source messages. However, when
the source messages are utilized for various tasks, e.g., wireless sensing data
for localization and activities detection, semantic communication technique is
difficult to be implemented because of the increased processing complexity. In
this paper, we propose the inverse semantic communications as a new paradigm.
Instead of extracting semantic information from messages, we aim to encode the
task-related source messages into a hyper-source message for data transmission
or storage. Following this paradigm, we design an inverse semantic-aware
wireless sensing framework with three algorithms for data sampling,
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided encoding, and self-supervised
decoding, respectively. Specifically, on the one hand, we propose a novel RIS
hardware design for encoding several signal spectrums into one MetaSpectrum. To
select the task-related signal spectrums for achieving efficient encoding, a
semantic hash sampling method is introduced. On the other hand, we propose a
self-supervised learning method for decoding the MetaSpectrums to obtain the
original signal spectrums. Using the sensing data collected from real-world, we
show that our framework can reduce the data volume by 95% compared to that
before encoding, without affecting the accomplishment of sensing tasks.
Moreover, compared with the typically used uniform sampling scheme, the
proposed semantic hash sampling scheme can achieve 67% lower mean squared error
in recovering the sensing parameters. In addition, experiment results
demonstrate that the amplitude response matrix of the RIS enables the
encryption of the sensing data.

create solutions insensitive to variations of the quantities to collect because

selects the wavelength in such a pure-bending configuration, in the absence of
any competing sources of work? In this paper, with the support of numerical
simulations, we argue that competition between stretching and bending energies
at local, mesoscopic scales leads to the selection of a wavelength scale
$\lambda^*$ sensitive to both the width $w$ and thickness $t$ of the sheet:
$\lambda^* \sim w^{2/3} t^{1/3} \Delta^{-1/6}$. This scale $\lambda^*$
corresponds to an arrest criterion for wrinkle coarsening starting from any
wavelength $\lambda \lesssim \lambda^*$, which can be interpreted in terms of
both size and energetic barriers to further coarsening. However, the sheet can
support coarser wavelengths: $\lambda \gtrsim \lambda^*$, since there is no
penalty to their existence. Since this wavelength selection mechanism depends
on the value of $\lambda$ itself, it is hysteretic.

work, we advocate that the effectiveness of image-text contrastive learning in
aligning the two modalities (for training CLIP) further makes it feasible to
treat texts as images for prompt tuning and introduce TaI prompting. In
contrast to the visual data, text descriptions are easy to collect, and their
class labels can be directly derived. Particularly, we apply TaI prompting to
multi-label image recognition, where sentences in the wild serve as
alternatives to images for prompt tuning. Moreover, with TaI, double-grained
prompt tuning (TaI-DPT) is further presented to extract both coarse-grained and
fine-grained embeddings for enhancing the multi-label recognition performance.
Experimental results show that our proposed TaI-DPT outperforms zero-shot CLIP
by a large margin on multiple benchmarks, e.g., MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE,

to new BC tasks, such as single and multiple goal reaching, and it can
zero-shot infer skills from a few example transitions. In addition, MaskDP
transfers well to offline RL and shows promising scaling behavior w.r.t. to

objects are represented by very few points. Most of the existing completion
methods are designed for partial point clouds with many points, and they
perform poorly or even fail completely in the case of few points. However, due
to the lack of detail information, completing objects from few points faces a
huge challenge. Inspired by the successful applications of GAN and Transformers
in the image-based vision task, we introduce GAN and Transformer techniques to
address the above problem. Firstly, the end-to-end encoder-decoder network with
Transformers and the Wasserstein GAN with Transformer are pre-trained, and then
the overall network is fine-tuned. Experimental results on the ShapeNet dataset
show that our method can not only improve the completion performance for many

be responsible for the observed disruption of the clockwise disc of young stars
in the Galactic Center, and show in numerical experiments that it produces the
observed features in the distribution of the stars' angular momenta. More
generally, we speculate that the rotation of nuclear star clusters has a

NAS-LID evaluates the geometrical properties of architectures by calculating

images during training, InDiReCT performs better than strong baselines and
approaches the performance of fully-supervised models. An analysis reveals that
InDiReCT learns to focus on regions of the image that correlate with the

effects of a subhorizon scalar field. Our calculation also includes the
scalar-induced gravitational wave spectrum classically computed in the previous
literature, which is significant only near the scales where the scalar field is
amplified. The super-horizon enhancement is a higher-order effect of the
interaction Hamiltonian, which can be understood as a Bogoliubov transformation
introduced by nonlinear interactions. On the other hand, the scale-invariant
reduction of the tensor power spectrum may occur due to the fourth-order
scalar-scalar-tensor-tensor coupling. This phenomenon can be understood as the
evolution of an anisotropic Bianchi type-I background in the separate universe
approach. Our result suggests that large-scale measurements may indirectly test
the dramatic effects of small-scale cosmological perturbations through loop

Explaining the variables or features to explain a model's decision is a need of

time consistent latent context and enables dynamics generalization in
high-dimensional control tasks. ProtoCAD extracts useful contextual information
with the help of the prototypes clustered over batch and benefits model-based
RL in two folds: 1) It utilizes a temporally consistent prototypical
regularizer that encourages the prototype assignments produced for different
time parts of the same latent trajectory to be temporally consistent instead of
comparing the features; 2) A context representation is designed which combines
both the projection embedding of latent states and aggregated prototypes and
can significantly improve the dynamics generalization ability. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoCAD surpasses existing methods in terms of dynamics
generalization. Compared with the recurrent-based model RSSM, ProtoCAD delivers
13.2% and 26.7% better mean and median performance across all dynamics

secure networks against various attacks from malicious users. Such users can
manipulate the radio spectrum to make the CR learn wrong behaviours and take
mistaken actions. The SA module consists of several functionalities that allow
the radio to learn a hierarchical representation of the environment and grow

obtaining smooth functions from noisy observations. But as splines are twice
differentiable by construction, they cannot capture potential discontinuities
in the underlying signal. The smoothing spline model can be augmented such that
discontinuities at a priori unknown locations are incorporated. The augmented
model results in a minimization problem with respect to discontinuity
locations. The minimizing solution is a cubic smoothing spline with
discontinuities (CSSD) which may serve as function estimator for discontinuous
signals, as a changepoint detector, and as a tool for exploratory data
analysis. However, these applications are hardly accessible at the moment
because there is no efficient algorithm for computing a CSSD. In this paper, we
propose an efficient algorithm that computes a global minimizer of the
underlying problem. Its worst case complexity is quadratic in the number of
data points. If the number of detected discontinuities scales linearly with the
signal length, we observe linear growth of the runtime. By the proposed
algorithm, a CSSD can be computed in reasonable time on standard hardware.
Furthermore, we implement a strategy for automatic selection of the
hyperparameters. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of a CSSD for
the tasks mentioned above.

Recently, quaternion representations of color images have achieved competitive

have gained considerable attention from researchers. In contrast to the
traditional quaternion matrix completion algorithms based on quaternion
singular value decomposition (QSVD), we propose a novel method based on

II h and k resonance lines and two lines of a subordinate triplet, as well as
two Mn I resonance lines. The first analysis of such data, in particular those
corresponding to a plage region, allowed the inference of the longitudinal
magnetic field from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere just below the
transition region. This was achieved by applying the weak field approximation
to the circular polarization profiles of the Mg II and Mn I lines. While the
applicability of this approximation to the Mg II lines was already demonstrated
in previous works, this is not the case for the Mn I UV multiplet. These lines
are observed as absorptions between the Mg II h and k lines, a region whose
intensity is shaped by their partial frequency redistribution effects.
Moreover, the only Mn I stable isotope has nuclear spin $I=5/2$ and thus
hyperfine structure must be, a priori, taken into account. Here we study the
generation and transfer of the intensity and circular polarization of the Mn I
resonance lines accounting for these physical ingredients. We analyze their
sensitivity to the magnetic field by means of their response function, and we
demonstrate the applicability of the weak field approximation to determine the

pristine bodies in the solar system, our goal is to derive optical constants of
real protoplanetary material. We determine the complex index of refraction of

sub-millimetre/millimetre observations of the thermal emission of the comet's
sub-surface made by the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO)
with synthetic temperatures derived from a thermophysical model and
radiative-transfer models. According to the two major formation scenarios of
comets, we model the sub-surface layers to consist of pebbles as well as of
homogeneously packed dust grains. In the case of a homogeneous dusty surface
material, we find a solution for the length-absorption coefficient of $\alpha
\approx 0.22~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for a wavelength of 1.594 mm and $\alpha \geq
3.84~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ for a wavelength of 0.533 mm and a constant thermal
conductivity of $0.006~\mathrm{Wm^{-1}K^{-1}}$. For the pebble scenario, we
find for the pebbles and a wavelength of 1.594 mm a complex refractive index of
$n = (1.074 - 1.256) + \mathrm{i} \, (2.580 - 7.431)\cdot 10^{-3}$ for pebble
radii between 1 mm and 6 mm. Taking into account other constraints, our results
point towards a pebble makeup of the cometary sub-surface with pebble radii
between 3 mm and 6 mm. The derived real part of the refractive index is used to
constrain the composition of the pebbles and their volume filling factor. The
optical and physical properties are discussed in the context of protoplanetary

solving the Sturm-Liouville boundary value problem, and verify its validity.
Further, we study the stability of NSs considering the fundamental mode
frequency variation with the mass of the star, and verify the stability

techniques for identifying and characterising HI sources while considering the
tradeoff between completeness and purity. This study aimed to find the optimal

were explored in an attempt to create a pipeline to optimally identify and mask
the sources in 3D neutral hydrogen 21 cm spectral line data cubes. Two
traditional source-finding methods were tested, SoFiA and MTObjects, as well as
a new supervised deep learning approach, in which a 3D convolutional neural
network architecture, known as V-Net was used. These three source-finding
methods were further improved by adding a classical machine learning classifier
as a post-processing step to remove false positive detections. The pipelines
were tested on HI data cubes from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope with
additional inserted mock galaxies. SoFiA combined with a random forest
classifier provided the best results, with the V-Net-random forest combination
a close second. We suspect this is due to the fact that there are many more
mock sources in the training set than real sources. There is, therefore, room
to improve the quality of the V-Net network with better-labelled data such that
it can potentially outperform SoFiA.

gradually to zero approaching the walls. This work has developed a Lattice Eddy
Simulation method (LAES), in which the sole empirical coefficient is constant

typical CFD mesh, treats the nodes as lattices and makes analysis on one
specific lattice, i. To be specific, LAES express the domain derivative on that
lattice with the influence of nearby lattices. The lattices right next to i,
which is named as i+, ""collide"" with i, imposing convective effects on i. The
lattices right next to i+, which is named as i++, impose convective effects on

The derived governing equations of LAES look like the Navier-Stokes equations

accurate predictions of turbulent channel flows at Re=180, 395, and 590 on very

Then we derive the CME driving powers and correlate them with CME parameters
(total mass, average speed, and acceleration) for standard and stealthy CMEs.
Besides, we study the forces that drive CMEs, namely, the Lorentz force,
gravitational force, and drag force due to the ambient solar wind near the Sun.
The results reveal that both the standard and stealthy CMEs are propelled by
the combined action of those forces in the inner corona. The drag force and
gravitational force are comparable with the Lorentz force. However, the impact
of the drag and Lorentz forces on the global evolution of the stealthy CMEs is
significantly weaker than that of the standard CMEs.

Existing feature tracking methods for event cameras are either handcrafted or

sensitive to noise, and do not generalize to different scenarios due to
unmodeled effects. To tackle these deficiencies, we introduce the first
data-driven feature tracker for event cameras, which leverages low-latency
events to track features detected in a grayscale frame. We achieve robust
performance via a novel frame attention module, which shares information across
feature tracks. By directly transferring zero-shot from synthetic to real data,
our data-driven tracker outperforms existing approaches in relative feature age
by up to 120% while also achieving the lowest latency. This performance gap is
further increased to 130% by adapting our tracker to real data with a novel

challenging. Recent advances have shown the power of graph neural networks
(GNNs) for determining the correlation between structure and dynamics in the
glassy system. These methods treat the glassy system as a topological graph.
However, the inherent ""smoothness"" property of the dynamics on the graph
(variation of dynamics over the graph) is ignored, resulting in a deteriorated
performance of GNN for dynamic predictions over various time scales. In this
paper, we first present an experimental investigation assessing the smoothness
patterns of particle dynamics from the graph perspective. The results indicate
that the long-time dynamics exhibit a smoother property on the graph, while the
short-time dynamics reveal a distinctly non-smooth pattern. To establish the
relationship between the static structure and dynamics with different
smoothness patterns, we propose a novel geometry-enhanced graph neural network
(Geo-GNN) model. The Geo-GNN architecture consists of a geometry feature
encoder that incorporates rotation-invariant distances and angles to enhance
geometric feature learning and a geometry-enhanced aggregation block that can
adaptively learn the underlying smoothness patterns during message passing.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to capture the
inherent smoothness pattern of particles and outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in predicting the dynamics across all time scales. A subsequent study
has revealed that geometric features are critical for the model to accurately
capture smoothness patterns in dynamics. Our research not only refines the
method for predicting glassy dynamics but also provides a new lens through
which to investigate the issue of causality regarding dynamical heterogeneity

star formation in the smallest progenitor halos at high redshift. The efficient
semi-analytical nature of A-SLOTH allows us to run many simulations with
various values of the local SV. Our investigation on the influence of the SV
shows that it delays star formation at high redshift. However, at redshift z=0,
the SV has no effect on the total stellar mass in the Milky Way nor its
Satellites. We find that extremely metal-poor and ultra metal-poor stars are
affected by the SV, and can hence be used to constrain its local value. The
local optimal value of the SV is $v_\mathrm{SV}

we conduct extra customized positive queries by extracting the positive

can cause significant damage to our planet and affect everyday life. As such,
efficient space weather prediction tools are necessary to forecast the arrival
and impact of CME eruptions. Recently, a new heliospheric model Icarus was
developed based on MPI-AMRVAC, which is a 3D ideal MHD model for the solar wind
and CME propagation, and it introduces advanced numerical techniques to make
the simulations more efficient. A cone model is used to study the evolution of
the CME through the background solar wind and its arrival and impact at Earth.
Grid stretching and AMR are combined in the simulations by using multiple
refinement criteria. We compare simulation results to the EUFHORIA model. As a
result, the simulations were sped up by a factor of 17 for the most optimal
configuration in Icarus. For the cone CME model, we found that limiting the AMR
to the region around the CME-driven shock yields the best results. The results
modelled by the simulations with radial grid stretching and AMR level 4 are
similar to the results provided by the original EUHFORIA and Icarus simulations
with the 'standard' resolution and equidistant grids. The simulations with 5
AMR levels yielded better results than the simulations with an equidistant grid
and standard resolution. Solution AMR is flexible and provides the user the
freedom to modify and locally increase the grid resolution according to the
purpose of the simulation. The advanced techniques implemented in Icarus can be
further used to improve the forecasting procedures, since the reduced
simulation time is essential to make physics-based forecasts less
computationally expensive.

algorithm to obtain exact samples using the technique of Coupling from the
Past. However, the sample complexity of this algorithm depends on the structure

rise in android mobile devices. Furthermore, the devices are geographically

of the massive proliferation of Android mobile devices; putting the data in a

malware classification techniques are not scalable. Researchers have proposed
federated learning (FL) based android malware classification system to solve
the privacy preservation and scalability with high classification performance.
In traditional FL, Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is utilized to construct the
global model at each round by merging all of the local models obtained from all
of the customers that participated in the FL. However, the conventional FedAvg
has a disadvantage: if one poor-performing local model is included in global
model development for each round, it may result in an under-performing global
model. Because FedAvg favors all local models equally when averaging. To
address this issue, our main objective in this work is to design a dynamic
weighted federated averaging (DW-FedAvg) strategy in which the weights for each
local model are automatically updated based on their performance at the client.
The DW-FedAvg is evaluated using four popular benchmark datasets, Melgenome,

Yet, MHD entails the assumption of a short mean free path, which is not
fulfilled in a collisionless plasma. Recently, for pair plasmas, we devised a
model allowing to account for kinetic effects within an MHD-like formalism. Its
relies on an estimate of the anisotropy generated when crossing the front, with
a subsequent assessment of the stability of this anisotropy in the downstream.
We solved our model for parallel, perpendicular and switch-on shocks. Here we
bridge between all these cases by treating the problem of an arbitrarily, but
coplanar, oriented magnetic field. Even though the formalism presented is valid
for anisotropic upstream temperatures, only the case of a cold upstream is
solved. We find extra solutions which are not part of the MHD catalog, and a
density jump that is notably less in the quasi parallel, highly magnetized,
regime. Given the complexity of the calculations, this work is mainly devoted
to the presentation of the mathematical aspect of our model. A forthcoming
article will be devoted to the physics of the shocks here defined.

insufficiently learn the relations among samples in data, leading to dissimilar

Topic-Semantic Contrastive Topic Model (TSCTM). To sufficiently model the
relations among samples, we employ a new contrastive learning method with
efficient positive and negative sampling strategies based on topic semantics.
This contrastive learning method refines the representations, enriches the
learning signals, and thus mitigates the sparsity issue. Extensive experimental

To ensemble the dual graph models, we introduce the technique of online

different concepts, it is optimized merely with respect to the prediction
accuracy on a single exercise at each step. With online knowledge distillation,
the dual graph models are adaptively combined to form a stronger teacher model,

for better modeling ability. In the experiments, we compare DGEKT against eight

magnetic fluctuations to particle-hole excitations in a two-component Fermi gas
makes the transition to itinerant ferromagnetism a first order phase
transition. This effect is not described by the paradigm of Landau's theory of
phase transitions, which assumes the free energy is an analytic function of the
order parameter and predicts a second order phase transition. On the other
hand, despite that larger symmetry often introduces larger degeneracies in the
low-lying states, here we show that for a Fermi gas with SU($N > 2$)-symmetry
in three space dimensions the ferromangetic phase transition is first order in
agreement with the predictions of Landau's theory [M. A. Cazalilla \emph{et
al}. New J. of Phys. {\bf 11} 103033 (2009)]. By performing unrestricted
Hartree-Fock calculations for an SU($N > 2$)-symmetric Fermi gas with short
range interactions, we find the order parameter undergoes a finite jump across
the transition. In addition, we do not observe any tri-critical point up to
temperatures $T \simeq 0.5\: T_F$, for which the thermal smearing of the Fermi
surface is subtantial. Going beyond mean-field, we find that the coupling of
magnetic fluctuations to particle-hole excitations makes the transition more
abrupt and further enhances the tendency of the gas to become fully polarized
for smaller values of $N$ and the gas parameter $k_F a_s$. In our study, we
also clarify the role of time reversal symmetry in the microscopic Hamiltonian

presence of the tri-critical point for $N = 2$ leads to a more pronounced
temperature dependence around the transition than for SU($N > 2$)-symmetric

to the entire volume. Previous works addressing this sparse and ill-posed
problem either produce low quality results, or rely on additional priors such
as target topology, appearance information, or input normal directions. In this
paper, we present OReX, a method for 3D shape reconstruction from slices alone,
featuring a Neural Field as the interpolation prior. A modest neural network is
trained on the input planes to return an inside/outside estimate for a given 3D
coordinate, yielding a powerful prior that induces smoothness and
self-similarities. The main challenge for this approach is high-frequency
details, as the neural prior is overly smoothing. To alleviate this, we offer
an iterative estimation architecture and a hierarchical input sampling scheme
that encourage coarse-to-fine training, allowing the training process to focus
on high frequencies at later stages. In addition, we identify and analyze a
ripple-like effect stemming from the mesh extraction step. We mitigate it by
regularizing the spatial gradients of the indicator function around input
in/out boundaries during network training, tackling the problem at the root.

our method is robust, accurate, and scales well with the size of the input. We

proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pilot matrix

fewer embeddings to represent their interests compared to active users. Second,
the negative samples are often generated by strategies with unobserved

separation in cells has received increasing attention, as these coacervates

However, the majority of studies focused on the behavior of pure systems in
bulk solutions, thus neglecting confinement effects and the interplay between
the numerous molecules present in cells. To advance our knowledge, we perform
simulations of binary polymer mixtures in droplets, considering both
monodisperse and polydisperse molecular weight distributions for the longer
polymer species. We find that confinement induces a spatial separation of the
polymers by length, with the shorter ones moving to the droplet surface. This
partitioning causes a distinct increase of the local polymer concentration in
the droplet center, which is more pronounced in polydisperse systems.
Consequently, the systems exhibit liquid-liquid phase separation at average
polymer concentrations where bulk systems are still in the one-phase regime.

to the heating of the solar chromosphere and drive plasma outflows. In both
cases, the thermalization of the wave energy occurs due to ion-neutral
collisions, but the obtained rates of plasma heating cannot explain the
observational data. The same is true for the magnitudes of the outflows.
  Aims. The aim of the present paper is to reexamine two-fluid modeling of
Alfv\'en and magnetoacoustic waves in the partially ionized solar chromosphere.
We attempt to detect variations in the ion temperature, and vertical plasma
flows for different wave combinations.
  Methods. We performed numerical simulations of the generation and evolution
of coupled Alfv\'en and magnetoacoustic waves using the JOANNA code, which
solves the two-fluid equations for ions (protons)+electrons and neutrals
(hydrogen atoms), coupled by collision terms.
  Results. We confirm that the damping of impulsively generated small-amplitude
waves negligibly affects the chromosphere temperature and generates only slow
plasma flows. In contrast, waves generated by large-amplitude pulses
significantly increase the chromospheric temperature and result in faster
plasma outflows. The maximum heating occurs when the pulse is launched from the
center of the photosphere, and the magnitude of the related plasma flows
increases with the amplitude of the pulse. Conclusions. Large-amplitude coupled
two-fluid Alfv\'en and magnetoacoustic waves can significantly contribute to
the heating of the solar chromosphere and to the generation of plasma outflows.

  The use of a clinical decision support system for assessing the quality of
care, based on computerized clinical guidelines (GLs), is likely to improve
care, reduce costs, save time, and enhance the staff's capabilities.
  Objectives
  Implement and evaluate a system for assessment of the quality of the care, in
the domain of management of pressure ulcers, by investigating the level of
compliance of the staff to the GLs.
  Methods
  Using data for 100 random patients from the local EMR system we performed a
technical evaluation, checking the applicability and usability, followed by a
functional evaluation of the system investigating the quality metrics given to
the compliance of the medical's staff to the protocol. We compared the scores
given by the nurse when supported by the system, to the scores given by the
nurse without the system's support, and to the scores given by the system. We
also measured the time taken to perform the assessment with and without the
system's support.
  Results
  There were no significant differences in the scores of most measures given by
the nurse using the system, compared to the scores given by the system. There
were also no significant differences across the values of most quality measures
given by the nurse without support compared to the values given by the nurse
with support. Using the system, however, significantly reduced the nurse's
average assessment time.
  Conclusions
  Using an automated quality-assessment system, may enable a senior nurse, to
quickly and accurately assess the quality of care. In addition to its accuracy,
the system considerably reduces the time taken to assess the various quality
measures.

decay in the form of exponential function with distance, and this is justified
through the complex wave number for the dissipation process. On the other hand,
such a mechanism is not explicitly proven for the scattering process. To
explain this, we consider a periodic array of ice floes, where the floe is
modeled by a vertical rigid cylinder. Using a homogenization technique, a
homogenized free surface equivalent to the array is obtained. Then, we show
that a dispersion relation of the homogenized free surface waves makes all wave
numbers complex. As a result, the exponential energy decay in the scattering
process is demonstrated. Although our model is obtained using many
simplifications, it reproduces consistent tendencies with both existing field
observations and numerical simulations; the wave attenuation coefficient for
the deep sea is proportional to the ice concentration and the wave number for
open water waves, and the coefficient is bigger as the radius and draft of the

is capable of processing up to 8 megapackets per second on 1 CPU core; the
packet processing takes O(1), which is significantly lower than with similar
algorithms. The managing subsystem consists of regional monitoring centres and
a main one. The main Monitoring Centre includes a main cluster of SDN
controllers along with Active/Active redundancy scheme. The regional centres
represent SDN software controllers that manage locally subordinate sensors. All
the managing centres are interconnected via the Transport subsystem and form a
network. An algorithm for network sensor load balancing between SDN controllers
has been developed in order to provide fault tolerance, load balancing and
network connectivity. The algorithm results in a set of optimal sensor groups
with total load not exceeding the maximum capacity of the SDN controllers.

was paid to stochastic methods. Concepts including Burgers turbulence, scalar
advection, incompressible turbulence, field theoretic methods, and stochastic

reasoning about amortized expected runtimes of randomized algorithms with
access to dynamic memory - the $\textsf{aert}$ calculus. Our calculus is truly
quantitative, i.e. instead of Boolean valued predicates, it manipulates
real-valued functions.
  En route to the $\textsf{aert}$ calculus, we study the $\textsf{ert}$
calculus for reasoning about expected runtimes of Kaminski et al. [2018]
extended by capabilities for handling dynamic memory, thus enabling
compositional and local reasoning about randomized data structures. This
extension employs runtime separation logic, which has been foreshadowed by
Matheja [2020] and then implemented in Isabelle/HOL by Haslbeck [2021]. In
addition to Haslbeck's results, we further prove soundness of the so-extended
$\textsf{ert}$ calculus with respect to an operational Markov decision process
model featuring countably-branching nondeterminism, provide intuitive
explanations, and provide proof rules enabling separation logic-style
verification for upper bounds on expected runtimes. Finally, we build the
so-called potential method for amortized analysis into the $\textsf{ert}$

  Since one needs to be able to handle changes in potential which can be
negative, the $\textsf{aert}$ calculus needs to be capable of handling signed

$\textsf{aert}$ calculus makes do without the need for involved technical
machinery keeping track of the integrability of the random variables.

optical spherical resonance cavity, the interaction of nanoparticles with light
both reflected and modified the internal light field mode structure. Depending

significant increase in modulation depth and narrowing of spherical cavity
resonance maxima (morphology dependent resonances - MDRs) observed both in

The observed phenomena could be attributed to the interaction of optical MDRs
with nanoparticle lattice shells forming and changing their structure at the
microdroplet surface. In this way, the formation and collapse of such lattices
could be detected.

class of finite structures has finite small Ramsey degrees, under the
(Generalized) Continuum Hypothesis the ultraproduct has finite big Ramsey
degrees for internal colorings. The necessity of restricting to internal
colorings is demonstrated by the example of the ultraproduct of finite linear
orders. Under CH, this ultraproduct $\fLL^*$ has, as a spine, $\eta_1$, an
uncountable analogue of the order type of rationals $\eta$. Finite big Ramsey
degrees for $\eta$ were exactly calculated by Devlin in \cite{Devlin}. It is
immediate from \cite{Tod87} that $\eta_1$ fails to have finite big Ramsey
degrees. Moreover, we extend Devlin's coloring to $\eta_1$ to show that it
witnesses big Ramsey degrees of finite tuples in $\eta$ on every copy of $\eta$
in $\eta_1,$ and consequently in $\fLL^*$. This work gives additional
confirmation that ultraproducts are a suitable environment for studying Ramsey

Within this paper, the focus is on rate-independent damage models. Since the
resulting phase-field energies in general are non-convex, we are faced with a
discontinuous evolution of the phase-field variable. Solution concepts have to
be carefully chosen in order to predict discontinuities that are physically
reasonable. We focus here on the concept of balanced viscosity solutions and
develop a convergence scheme that combines alternate minimization with a local

show the performance of this combined approach. Particularly, the effect of

different tasks, such as image classification, semantic segmentation and

like relative positional encoding. However, there exists different kinds of
spatial relations, including short-range, medium-range and long-range
relations, and modeling them separately can better capture the focus of
different tasks on the multi-range relations (e.g., short-range relations can
be important in instance segmentation, while long-range relations should be
upweighted for semantic segmentation). In this work, we introduce the EurNet
for Efficient multi-range relational modeling. EurNet constructs the
multi-relational graph, where each type of edge corresponds to short-, medium-
or long-range spatial interactions. In the constructed graph, EurNet adopts a
novel modeling layer, called gated relational message passing (GRMP), to
propagate multi-relational information across the data. GRMP captures multiple
relations within the data with little extra computational cost. We study
EurNets in two important domains for image and protein structure modeling.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and
ADE20K semantic segmentation verify the gains of EurNet over the previous SoTA
FocalNet. On the EC and GO protein function prediction benchmarks, EurNet
consistently surpasses the previous SoTA GearNet. Our results demonstrate the

of sums of complex sinusoids corrupted by noise, and the zoom ESPRIT algorithm
utilizes the zoom technique to apply the ESPRIT to a narrow frequency band to
improve the accuracy of frequency estimation. However, the Gaussian noise
becomes non-Gaussian in the zoomed baseband after being filtered by a low-pass
filter, and thus has an unknown covariance matrix. However, most exiting
algorithms for model order estimation performs poorly for the case of colored
noise with unknown covariance matrix. In order to accurately estimate the
dimension of the signal subspace for the zoom ESPRIT algorithm, this paper
proposes a novel strategy to estimate the number of signals for the case of
colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. The proposed strategy is based on
the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria utilized in
model order selection. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of
the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is
analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Secondly, a
novel second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the
next value of the first criterion, and its properties is also analyzed with
respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel signal number
estimation method is proposed by combining the second criterion with the first
criterion to check whether the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal
or from noise. The resulted signal number estimation method is called as the
double criterion-based estimator as it utilizes two criteria to separate the
signal eigenvalues from the noise eigenvalues. Finally, simulation results are
presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed double criterion-based

pathology detection and lung segmentation. There is a large body of work where
machine learning algorithms are developed for specific tasks. A significant
recent example is Coronavirus disease (covid-19) detection using CXR data.
However, the traditional diagnostic tool design methods based on supervised

should be of good quality for better clinical outcomes. Here, we propose an
alternative solution, a new self-supervised paradigm, where a general
representation from CXRs is learned using a group-masked self-supervised

that the same pre-training can be used for the lung segmentation task. Our
proposed paradigm shows robust performance in multiple downstream tasks which
demonstrates the success of the pre-training. Moreover, the performance of the
pre-trained models on data with significant drift during test time proves the
learning of a better generic representation. The methods are further validated
by covid-19 detection in a unique small-scale pediatric data set. The
performance gain in accuracy (~25%) is significant when compared to a
supervised transformer-based method. This adds credence to the strength and

radius is beyond the corotation radius, matter climbs up to the high latitudes
where the Alfv\'en surface is inside the equilibrium surface and can accrete.
We calculate the fraction of the mass flux in the disc that can accrete onto
the neutron star depending on the fastness parameter and the inclination angle
between rotation and magnetic axis. We find that, for a narrow range of the
fastness parameter, the Alfv\'en and the equilibrium surfaces intersect at two
different critical latitudes. While the system is transiting from the propeller
to the accretion regime (the initial rise of an outburst), accretion proceeds
from the region above the higher critical latitude. In transitions from the
accretion to the propeller regime (decay of the outburst), accretion of matter
can proceed from the disc midplane. As a result, the transition from the
propeller to the accretion regime occurs at a luminosity higher than the
transition from the accretion to the propeller regime. We discuss the
implications of our results for spectral transitions exhibited by low-mass

phase transition. When the external field is reversed and strong, the observed
phase transition is from an ordered configuration to cluster formations. The

linearising the $f(R)$ action written in an equivalent scalar-tensor format in
the Einstein frame, we identify the appropriate interaction terms between the
massless spin-2 tensor mode, massive scalar mode, and the energy momentum
tensor. The definition of the scalar field is related to the $f(R)$ models.
Then using the interaction vertex we compute the rate of energy loss due to
spin-2 quadrupole radiation, which comes out to be the same as the
Peter-Mathews formula with a multiplication factor, and also the energy loss
due to the scalar dipole radiation. The total energy loss is the sum of these
two contributions. Our derivation is most general as it is applicable for both
arbitrary eccentricity of the binary orbits and arbitrary mass of the scalar
field. Using the derived theoretical formula for the period decay of the binary

the orbital precession of the S2 star around the supermassive black hole (SMBH)

universal constant $\delta$) with the Schwarzschild precession of the S-stars
assuming that the observed values as indicated by the GRAVITY Collaboration
will have a small deviation from GR prediction. GR provides the most natural
way to fit observational data for S-star orbits, however, their precessions can
be fitted by Yukawa gravity. Our main goal was to study the possible influence

the precessions of S-star orbits. We analyze S-star orbits assuming different
strength of Yukawa interaction $\delta$ and find that this parameter has strong
influence on range of Yukawa interaction $\Lambda$. For that purpose we use PPN

algorithms that have black-box access to a random oracle. Although there are
several established techniques for proving query lower bounds for both quantum
and classical algorithms, there is no such widely applicable technique for
hybrid algorithms and the optimal tradeoffs for many fundamental problems are
still unknown $\unicode{x2013}$ an optimal tradeoff for the search problem was
only shown recently by Rosmanis, although not in the random oracle model. For
another fundamental problem, collision finding, the optimal tradeoff was not
known.
  In this work, we develop a framework for recording a query transcript for
quantum-classical algorithms that represents the knowledge gained by the
algorithm. The main feature of this framework is to allow us to record queries
in two incompatible bases $\unicode{x2013}$ classical queries in the standard
basis and quantum queries in the Fourier basis $\unicode{x2013}$ in a
consistent way. We call the framework the hybrid compressed oracle as it
naturally interpolates between the classical way of recording queries and the
compressed oracle framework of Zhandry for recording quantum queries. We
demonstrate its applicability by giving a simpler proof of the optimal
quantum-classical tradeoff for search and by showing an optimal tradeoff for
collision finding.

  Communications Paradigm in 6G era","Survey paper on OTFS, submitted to China Communications",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In 6G era, the space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are expected to
provide global coverage and thus are required to support a wide range of
emerging applications in hostile environments with high-mobility. In such
scenarios, conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
modulation, which has been widely deployed in the cellular and Wi-Fi
communications systems, will suffer from performance degradation due to high
Doppler shift. To address this challenge, a new two-dimensional (2D) modulation
scheme referred to as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) was proposed and
has been recognized as an enabling technology for future high-mobility
scenarios. In particular, OTFS modulates information in the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain rather than the time-frequency (TF) domain for OFDM, providing the
benefits of Doppler-resilience and delay-resilience, low signaling latency, low
peak-to-average ratio (PAPR), and low-complexity implementation. Recent
researches also show that the direct interaction of information and physical
world in the DD domain makes OTFS an promising waveform for realizing
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). In this article, we will present
a comprehensive survey of OTFS technology in 6G era, including the
fundamentals, recent advances, and future works. Our aim is that this article
could provide valuable references for all researchers working in the area of
OTFS.

action spaces, hybrid action space is a merged search space, in which TBO
better implements the trade-off between frequent switching and unsaturated

existing baselines. Furthermore, we calculate the Gini coefficients of the

thermodynamic parameters space to describe first order phase transitions of
black holes. By employing an off-shell internal energy, we find two types of
topological defects. The first is normal, describing black holes which move
with a nonzero velocity and acceleration, in a central force field. The second
type of defects are exotic: they are static in the space, not describing black
holes but encoding information about first order transitions. For each defect,
we assign a winding number and an inertial mass. By studying neutral and
charged black holes in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space, we show that first
order transitions can be viewed as once or twice interchange of winding numbers
between black holes and the exotic defects, through wired action at a distance.
This corresponds to the usual notion: a smaller black hole grows into a larger
black hole or vice versa. However, our topological analysis illustrates that
the transition can also be locally interpreted as virtual collisions between
black holes and the exotic defects. In this interpretation, a smaller black
hole first grows into a new exotic defect whereas an original exotic defect
grows into a larger black hole. All the defects simply change their positions
and momentums, rather than interchanging the winding numbers. Critical point of
the transition can be extracted when all the defects meet in the parameters
space. Certain quantities, such as the Jacobians and the velocities of normal
defects show universal behaviors near the critical point.

but possibly very small broadening factor $\eta$, focusing on cases in which
downfolded Hamiltonians can be evaluated efficiently using Wannier
interpolation. We describe robust, high-order accurate algorithms automating
convergence to a user-specified error tolerance $\varepsilon$, emphasizing an
efficient computational scaling with respect to $\eta$. After analyzing the
standard equispaced integration method, applicable in the case of large
broadening, we describe a simple iterated adaptive integration algorithm
effective in the small $\eta$ regime. Its computational cost scales as
$\mathcal{O}(\log^3(\eta^{-1}))$ as $\eta \to 0^+$ in three dimensions, as
opposed to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{-3})$ for equispaced integration. We argue that,
by contrast, tree-based adaptive integration methods scale only as
$\mathcal{O}(\log(\eta^{-1})/\eta^{2})$ for typical Brillouin zone integrals.
In addition to its favorable scaling, the iterated adaptive algorithm is
straightforward to implement, particularly for integration on the irreducible
Brillouin zone, for which it avoids the tetrahedral meshes required for
tree-based schemes. We illustrate the algorithms by calculating the spectral
function of SrVO$_3$ with broadening on the meV scale.

$\Xi_c = (\Xi_c^{(\prime)+},\Xi_c^{(\prime)0})$ and $\pi = (\pi^+ , \pi^0)$.
The soft-meson limit is considered along with the pole model, and the baryon
matrix elements are evaluated by the bag model with and without removing the
center-of-mass motion (CMM). We find that the four-quark operator matrix
elements are about twice larger once the unwanted CMM is removed. We obtain
that ${\cal R} = {\cal B}(\Xi_{cc}^+ \to \Xi_c^{\prime +} \pi^+ )/ {\cal
B}(\Xi_{cc}^+ \to \Xi_c^{ +} \pi^+ ) = 0.87^{+0.17}_{-0.11} $ and $1.45$ with

the later is well consistent with ${\cal R} = 1.41 \pm 0.17 \pm 0.10$ measured
at LHCb. In addition, we show that after including the mixing, the up-down
asymmetry of $\alpha( \Xi_{cc}^+ \to \Xi_c^{(\prime)0 } \pi^+)$ flips sign.
Explicitly, we obtain that $\alpha(\Xi_{cc}^{+} \to \Xi_c^{\prime +} \pi^0) =
0.52$ and $\alpha(\Xi_{cc}^{+} \to \Xi_c^{ 0 } \pi^+) = 0.31$ with and without
the CMM corrections, respectively, which are all negative if the mixing is
absence. As a bonus, a positive value of $\alpha(\Xi_{cc}^{+} \to \Xi_c^{\prime

an electromechanical (optomechanical) system where an electric (optical) field
is driving two mechanical resonators which are mechanically coupled through a
phase-dependent phonon-hopping. This phase induces series of EPs once it
matches the condition of $\frac{\pi}{2}(2n +1)$. For any perturbation of the
system, the phase-matched condition is no longer satisfied and this lifts the
EP-degeneracies leading to a frequency splitting that scales as the square root
of the perturbation strength, resulting in a giant sensitivity-factor
enhancement. Owing to the set of EPs, our proposal allows multiple sensing
scheme and performs better than its anti-PT-symmetric sensor counterpart. This
work sheds light on new platforms that can be used for mass sensing purposes,
opening up new opportunities in nanoparticles or pollutants detection, and to

closure and opening when an elastomer is brought in and out of contact with a
flat, rigid, adhesive counterface. A separate origin of adhesive hysteresis is
small-scale, elastic multistability. Here, we study a system in which both
mechanisms act concurrently. Specifically, we compare the simulated and
experimentally measured time evolution of the interfacial force and the real
contact area between a soft elastomer and a rigid, flat punch, to which
small-scale, single-sinusoidal roughness is added. To this end, we further the
Green's function molecular dynamics method and extend recently developed
imaging techniques to elucidate the rate- and preload-dependence of the
pull-off process. Our results reveal that hysteresis is much enhanced when the
saddle points of the topography come into contact, which, however, is impeded
by viscoelastic forces and may require sufficiently large preloads. A similar
coaction of viscous- and multistability effects is expected to occur in
macroscopic polymer contacts and to be relevant, e.g., for pressure-sensitive
adhesives and modern adhesive gripping devices.

2-point correlation function of galaxy clusters. Methods. Using 1000 PINOCCHIO
light cones mimicking the expected Euclid sample of galaxy clusters, we
calibrate a simple model to accurately describe the clustering covariance.
Then, we use such a model to quantify the likelihood analysis response to
variations of the covariance, and investigate the impact of a
cosmology-dependent matrix at the level of statistics expected for the Euclid
survey of galaxy clusters. Results. We find that a Gaussian model with
Poissonian shot-noise does not correctly predict the covariance of the 2-point
correlation function of galaxy clusters. By introducing few additional
parameters fitted from simulations, the proposed model reproduces the numerical
covariance with 10 per cent accuracy, with differences of about 5 per cent on
the figure of merit of the cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and
$\sigma_8$. Also, we find that the cosmology-dependence of the covariance adds
valuable information that is not contained in the mean value, significantly
improving the constraining power of cluster clustering. Finally, we find that
the cosmological figure of merit can be further improved by taking mass binning
into account. Our results have significant implications for the derivation of
cosmological constraints from the 2-point clustering statistics of the Euclid
survey of galaxy clusters.

activity in the Galactic center supermassive black hole Sgr A$^*$. The claimed
jets are often assumed to be perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Motivated by
the orientation of pc-scale nuclear stellar disk and gas streams, and a low
inclination of the accretion disk around Sgr A$^*$ inferred by the Event
Horizon Telescope, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of nuclear jets
significantly tilted relative to the Galactic rotation axis. The observed
axisymmetry and hemisymmetry (north-south symmetry) of Fermi/eROSITA bubbles
(FEBs) due to quasi-steady jets in Sgr A$^*$ can be produced if the jet had a
super-Eddington power ($\gtrsim 5\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for a short time
(jet active period $\lesssim 6$ kyr) for a reasonable jet opening angle
($\lesssim 10^\circ$). Such powerful explosions are, however, incompatible with
the observed O VIII/O VII line ratio towards the bubbles, even after
considering electron-proton temperature non-equilibrium. We argue that the only
remaining options for producing FEBs are i) a low-luminosity ($\approx
10^{40.5-41}$ erg s$^{-1}$)) magnetically dominated jet or accretion wind from
the Sgr A$^*$, and ii) a SNe or TDE driven wind of a similar luminosity from
the Galactic center.

  wind Speeds and Fault Severities",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamic security assessment of power systems needs to scan contingencies
in a preselected set through time-domain simulations. With more and more
inverter-based-generation, such as wind and solar power generation, integrated
into power systems, electro-magnetic transient simulation is adopted. However,
the complexity of simulation will increase greatly if inverter-based-generation
units are modeled in detail. In order to reduce the complexity of simulation of
power systems including large-scale wind farms, it is critical to develop
dynamic equivalent methods for wind farms which are applicable to the expected
contingency analysis. The dynamic response characteristics of permanent magnet
synchronous generator-wind turbine generators (PMSG-WTGs) are not only
influenced by their control strategies, but also by the operating wind speeds
and the fault severities. Thus, this paper proposes a dynamic equivalent method
for PMSG-WTG based wind farms considering the wind speeds and the fault
severities. Firstly, this paper analyzes all possible response characteristics
of a PMSG-WTG and proposes a clustering method based on the operating wind
speed and the terminal voltage of each PMSG-WTG at the end of the fault. Then,
a single-machine equivalent method is introduced for each group of PMSG-WTGs.
For the group of PMSG-WTGs with active power ramp recovery process, an
equivalent model with segmented ramp rate limitation for active current is
designed. In order to obtain the clustering indicators, a simulation-based
iterative method is put forward to calculate the voltage at point of common
connection (PCC) of the wind farm, and a PMSG-WTG terminal voltage calculation
method is further presented. Eventually, the efficiency and accuracy of the
proposed method are verified by the simulation results.

the other hand, even simulated massive galaxies in overdense regions cannot
reproduce the intense star formation rates and the large stellar masses of

population III stars to the UV flux decreases as the stellar mass increases and
it is a few percent for galaxies with $M_{\rm star} \sim 10^{8}~\rm M_{\odot}$.
Therefore, a part of the observed flux by JWST could be the light from
population III stars. Our simulations suggest that the UV flux can be dominated

learning advances, especially on artificial neural networks. As the field
matures, new data and models created by different groups become available,

networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they forget how to perform
an old task when trained on a new one. This hinders cooperation because
adapting an existing model for a new task affects the performance on a previous
task trained by someone else. The authors developed a continual learning method
that addresses this issue, applying it here for the first time to solid
mechanics. In particular, the method is applied to recurrent neural networks to
predict history-dependent plasticity behavior, although it can be used on any
other architecture (feedforward, convolutional, etc.) and to predict other
phenomena. This work intends to spawn future developments on continual learning
that will foster cooperative strategies among the mechanics community to solve
increasingly challenging problems. We show that the chosen continual learning
strategy can sequentially learn several constitutive laws without forgetting
them, using less data to achieve the same error as standard training of one law

virtual control of the quadcopter system. The disturbance estimate is used
directly for the passive FTC with rotor failure. To avoid controller switching
between normal control and FTC, a dynamic control allocation is used. In
addition, the closed-loop stability has been analyzed and a virtual control
feedback is adopted to achieve the passive FTC for the quadcopter with two and

outdoor experiments are performed for the first time, which have demonstrated
that the hovering quadcopter is able to recover from one rotor failure by the

understand the star-formation process across the epochs. Although there exist
various three-dimensional hydro-chemical codes modelling the ISM at different
scales and redshifts, they are computationally expensive and inefficient for
studies over a large parameter space. Building on our earlier approach, we
present PDFchem, a novel algorithm that models the cold ISM at moderate and
large scales using functions connecting the quantities of the local ($A_{\rm
V,eff}$) and the observed ($A_{\rm V,obs}$) visual extinctions, and the local
number density, $n_{\rm H}$, with probability density functions (PDF) of
$A_{\rm V,obs}$ on cloud scales typically tens-to-hundreds of pc as an input.
For any given $A_{\rm V,obs}$-PDF, sampled with thousands of clouds, the
algorithm instantly computes the average abundances of the most important
species (HI, H$_2$, CII, CI, CO, OH, OH$^+$, H$_2$O$^+$, CH, HCO$^+$) and
performs radiative transfer calculations to estimate the average emission of
the most commonly observed lines ([CII]~$158\mu$m, both [CI] fine-structure
lines and the first five rotational transitions of $^{12}$CO). We examine two
$A_{\rm V,obs}$-PDFs corresponding to a non star-forming and a star-forming ISM
region, under a variety of environmental parameters combinations. These cover
FUV intensities in the range of $\chi/\chi_0=10^{-1}-10^3$, cosmic-ray
ionization rates in the range of $\zeta_{\rm CR}=10^{-17}-10^{-13}\,{\rm

is fast, easy to use, reproduces the PDR quantities of the time-consuming
hydrodynamical models and can be used directly with observed data to understand
the evolution of the cold ISM chemistry.

optical and UV pulsar. So far, it is the only optical transitional millisecond
pulsar. The rotation- and accretion-powered emission mechanisms hardly
individually explain the observed characteristics of optical pulsations. A
synergistic model, combining these standard emission processes, was proposed to
explain the origin of the X-ray/UV/optical pulsations. We study the phase lag
between the pulses in the optical and X-ray bands to gain insight into the
physical mechanisms that cause it. We performed a detailed timing analysis of
simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations in the X-ray band, acquired
with the XMM-Newton and NICER satellites, and in the optical band, with the
fast photometers SiFAP2 (mounted at the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo) and
Aqueye+ (mounted at the 1.8 m Copernicus Telescope). We estimated the time lag
of the optical pulsation with respect to that in the X-rays by modeling the
folded pulse profiles with two harmonic components. Optical pulses lag the
X-ray pulses by $\sim$ 150 $\mu$s in observations acquired with instruments
(NICER and Aqueye+) whose absolute timing uncertainty is much smaller than the
measured lag. We also show that the phase lag between optical and X-ray
pulsations lies in a limited range of values, $\delta \phi \in$ (0 $-$ 0.15),

both pulsations originate from the same region, and it supports the hypothesis
of a common emission mechanism. Our results are interpreted in the shock-driven
mini pulsar nebula scenario. This scenario suggests that optical and X-ray
pulses are produced by synchrotron emission from the shock that formed within a
few light cylinder radii away ($\sim$ 100 km) from the pulsar, where its
striped wind encounters the accretion disk inflow.

Compared with pure gels of sticky colloids, therefore, the composites of gel

numerical simulations, we investigate the gelation process in such binary
composites. We find that the non-sticky particles not only confine gelation in
the form of an effective volume fraction, but also introduce another
lengthscale that competes with the size of growing clusters in gel. The ratio
of two key lengthscales in general controls the two effects. Using different

UAV networks. Moreover, UAVs typically have limited battery and computation
capacity, making them unaffordable for heavy security provisioning operations
when performing complicated rescue tasks. In this paper, we develop
RescueChain, a secure and efficient information sharing scheme for UAV-assisted
disaster rescue. Specifically, we first implement a lightweight
blockchain-based framework to safeguard data sharing under disasters and
immutably trace misbehaving entities. A reputation-based consensus protocol is
devised to adapt the weakly connected environment with improved consensus
efficiency and promoted UAVs' honest behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel vehicular fog computing (VFC)-based off-chain mechanism by leveraging
ground vehicles as moving fog nodes to offload UAVs' heavy data processing and
storage tasks. To offload computational tasks from the UAVs to ground vehicles
having idle computing resources, an optimal allocation strategy is developed by
choosing payoffs that achieve equilibrium in a Stackelberg game formulation of
the allocation problem. For lack of sufficient knowledge on network model
parameters and users' private cost parameters in practical environment, we also
design a two-tier deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to seek the
optimal payment and resource strategies of UAVs and vehicles with improved

adversarial examples in general, the colluding sets do not transfer well to
different classifiers. We explore two hypotheses to explain this: 'overfitting'

strategies suggested by these hypotheses, the colluding inputs transfer no
better than adversarial inputs that are generated independently in the usual

  Fundamental Drivers for Location, Shape and Scale of the Price Distribution",,,,,"q-fin.ST econ.EM q-fin.CP stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the last years, European intraday power markets have gained importance
for balancing forecast errors due to the rising volumes of intermittent
renewable generation. However, compared to day-ahead markets, the drivers for
the intraday price process are still sparsely researched. In this paper, we
propose a modelling strategy for the location, shape and scale parameters of
the return distribution in intraday markets, based on fundamental variables. We
consider wind and solar forecasts and their intraday updates, outages, price
information and a novel measure for the shape of the merit-order, derived from
spot auction curves as explanatory variables. We validate our modelling by
simulating price paths and compare the probabilistic forecasting performance of
our model to benchmark models in a forecasting study for the German market. The
approach yields significant improvements in the forecasting performance,
especially in the tails of the distribution. At the same time, we are able to
derive the contribution of the driving variables. We find that, apart from the
first lag of the price changes, none of our fundamental variables have
explanatory power for the expected value of the intraday returns. This implies
weak-form market efficiency as renewable forecast changes and outage
information seems to be priced in by the market. We find that the volatility is
driven by the merit-order regime, the time to delivery and the closure of
cross-border order books. The tail of the distribution is mainly influenced by
past price differences and trading activity. Our approach is directly
transferable to other continuous intraday markets in Europe.

each other. However, most programming languages do not support both of them in
their full generality, or if they do, they are still seen as distinct
constructs with separately defined type-checking, compilation, etc. Rendel et
al. were the first to propose variants of two standard program transformations,
de- and refunctionalization, as a test to gauge and improve the symmetry
between data and codata types. However, in previous works, codata and data were
still seen as separately defined language constructs, with de- and
refunctionalization being defined as similar but separate algorithms. These
works also glossed over interactions between the aforementioned transformations
and evaluation order, which leads to a loss of desirable $\eta$ expansion
equalities. We argue that the failure of complete symmetry is due to the
inherent asymmetry of natural deduction as the logical foundation of the
language design. Natural deduction is asymmetric in that its focus is on
producers (proofs) of types, whereas consumers (contexts, continuations,
refutations) have a second-class status. Inspired by existing
sequent-calculus-based language designs, we present the first language design
that is fully symmetric in that the issues of polarity (data type vs codata
types) and evaluation order (call-by-value vs call-by-name) are untangled and
become independent attributes of a single form of type declaration. Both
attributes, polarity and evaluation order, can be changed independently by one
algorithm each. In particular, defunctionalization and refunctionalization are
now one algorithm. Evaluation order can be defined and changed individually for
each type, independently from polarity. By allowing only certain combinations
of evaluation order and polarity, the aforementioned $\eta$ laws can be
restored.

data. Owing to the advantages of federated learning, federated graph learning
(FGL) enables clients to train strong GNN models in a distributed manner
without sharing their private data. A core challenge in federated systems is
the non-IID problem, which also widely exists in real-world graph data. For
example, local data of clients may come from diverse datasets or even domains,
e.g., social networks and molecules, increasing the difficulty for FGL methods
to capture commonly shared knowledge and learn a generalized encoder. From
real-world graph datasets, we observe that some structural properties are
shared by various domains, presenting great potential for sharing structural
knowledge in FGL. Inspired by this, we propose FedStar, an FGL framework that
extracts and shares the common underlying structure information for inter-graph
federated learning tasks. To explicitly extract the structure information
rather than encoding them along with the node features, we define structure
embeddings and encode them with an independent structure encoder. Then, the
structure encoder is shared across clients while the feature-based knowledge is
learned in a personalized way, making FedStar capable of capturing more
structure-based domain-invariant information and avoiding feature misalignment
issues. We perform extensive experiments over both cross-dataset and
cross-domain non-IID FGL settings, demonstrating the superiority of FedStar.

lower to higher Green's functions and, if they are truncated, the resulting

dust formation and radiative transfer modelling to reconstruct the late AGB
phases and the initial contraction to the post-AGB phase. We also determine the
mass-loss and dust formation rates for stars of different mass and chemical
composition. The analysis of the IR excess of the post-AGB, O-rich stars
examined in this study outlines an interesting complexity, in terms of the
correlation between the dust in the surroundings of the stars, the evolutionary
status and the progenitor's mass. The sources descending from massive AGBs

excess than the lower mass counterparts, owing to the more intense dust
formation taking place during the final AGB phases. From the determination of
the location of the dusty regions we deduce that the expanding velocities of
the outflow change significantly from star to star. The possibility that
radiation pressure is unable to accelerate the wind in the faintest objects is
also commented.

evolution. Here we present the results of Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations
of a complete sample of 46 powerful 2Jy radio AGN at intermediate redshifts

sample of radio AGN undertaken by Herschel. In order to assess the importance
of non-thermal synchrotron emission at far-IR wavelengths, we also present new
APEX sub-mm and ALMA mm data. We find that the overall incidence of non-thermal
contamination in the PACS bands ($<$200$\mu$m) is in the range 28 -- 43%;
however, this rises to 30 -- 72% for wavelengths ($> $200$\mu$m) sampled by the
SPIRE instrument. Non-thermal contamination is strongest in objects with
compact CSS/GPS or extended FRI radio morphologies, and in those with type 1
optical spectra. Considering thermal dust emission, we find strong correlations
between the 100 and 160$\mu$m monochromatic luminosities and AGN power
indicators, providing further evidence that radiation from the AGN may be an
important heating source for the far-IR emitting dust. Clearly, AGN
contamination -- whether by the direct emission from synchrotron-emitting lobes
and cores, or via radiative heating of the cool dust -- needs to be carefully
considered when using the far-IR continuum to measure the star formation rates
in the host galaxies of radio AGN.

utility of the user is derived from a single execution of a policy. In these
settings, making decisions based on the average future returns is not suitable.
For example, in a medical setting a patient may only have one opportunity to
treat their illness. Making decisions using just the expected future returns --
known in reinforcement learning as the value -- cannot account for the
potential range of adverse or positive outcomes a decision may have. Therefore,
we should use the distribution over expected future returns differently to
represent the critical information that the agent requires at decision time by
taking both the future and accrued returns into consideration. In this paper,
we propose two novel Monte Carlo tree search algorithms. Firstly, we present a
Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that can compute policies for nonlinear
utility functions (NLU-MCTS) by optimising the utility of the different
possible returns attainable from individual policy executions, resulting in
good policies for both risk-aware and multi-objective settings. Secondly, we
propose a distributional Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (DMCTS) which
extends NLU-MCTS. DMCTS computes an approximate posterior distribution over the
utility of the returns, and utilises Thompson sampling during planning to
compute policies in risk-aware and multi-objective settings. Both algorithms
outperform the state-of-the-art in multi-objective reinforcement learning for
the expected utility of the returns.

The
latent position model is widely used for analysing network data, whereby each
actor is positioned in a latent space. Inferring the dimension of this space is
challenging. Often, for simplicity, two dimensions are used or model selection
criteria are employed to select the dimension, but this requires choosing a
criterion and the computational expense of fitting multiple models. Here the
latent shrinkage position model (LSPM) is proposed which intrinsically infers
the effective dimension of the latent space. The LSPM employs a Bayesian
nonparametric multiplicative truncated gamma process prior that ensures
shrinkage of the variance of the latent positions across higher dimensions.
Dimensions with non-negligible variance are deemed most useful to describe the
observed network, inducing automatic inference on the latent space dimension.
While the LSPM is applicable to many network types, logistic and Poisson LSPMs
are developed here for binary and count networks respectively. Inference
proceeds via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, where novel surrogate
proposal distributions reduce the computational burden. The LSPM's properties
are assessed through simulation studies, and its utility is illustrated through
application to real network datasets. Open source software assists wider
implementation of the LSPM.

of new datasets is hindered by the conceptual distinction between low-stakes

a dataset of one kind could not be used for applications for the other kind.
Even though it is easier to acquire data on low-stakes deception since it can
be simulated (faked) in controlled settings, these lies do not hold the same
significance or depth as genuine high-stakes lies, which are much harder to
obtain and hold the practical interest of automated DD systems. To investigate
whether this distinction holds true from a practical perspective, we design
several experiments comparing a high-stakes DD dataset and a low-stakes DD
dataset evaluating their results on a Deep Learning classifier working
exclusively from video data. In our experiments, a network trained in
low-stakes lies had better accuracy classifying high-stakes deception than
low-stakes, although using low-stakes lies as an augmentation strategy for the

pyrocurrent, transport, dielectric and the DC and AC magnetic properties of

These measurements clearly highlight several critical temperatures in the
material and correlation between the different orders: i) the centrosymmetry is
broken at high temperature (T$_S$ = 200K), ii) then the long-range magnetic
order of B-sites occurs at T$_{N,B}$ = 108 K and at this same temperature the
compound enters in an insulating dielectric state. iii) Finally, a remnant
polarization is stabilized concomitantly with a magnetic anomaly at T* = 70 K.

which the polar state is driven by short-range magnetic order.

encoding (AAE) method, which uses a variational means to approximately load a

recently proposed as a general approach to this problem mainly for near-term

its application range. In this work, we extend AAE so that it can handle a

constraint on the Villain operator leads to the absence of defects (e.g.
vortices, monopoles,...). These lattice models therefore have the same symmetry
and anomaly structure as their corresponding continuum models. Moreover they
can be formulated in a way that makes the well-know dualities look manifest,

data enhanced lifelong learner to explore SSLL. Specially, we dedicate
task-specific modules to alleviate catastrophic forgetting and design two
modules to exploit unlabeled data: (1) a virtual supervision enhanced task
solver is constructed on a teacher-student framework to mine the underlying
knowledge from unlabeled data; and (2) a backward augmented learner is built to
encourage knowledge transfer from newly arrived unlabeled data to previous
tasks. Experimental results on various language tasks demonstrate our model's
effectiveness and superiority over competitive baselines under the new setting

moving-frame coordinate together with Lin's method to construct heteroclinic

to: (i) obtain multiple coexisting pulse and front solutions for the RDE by
computing heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria at negative and positive
infinity in the compactified moving-frame ordinary differential equation, (ii)
detect tipping points as dangerous bifurcations of such heteroclinic orbits and
(iii) obtain tipping diagrams by numerical continuation of such bifurcations.
We apply our framework to an illustrative model of a habitat patch that
features an Allee effect in population growth and is geographically shrinking
or shifting due to human activity or climate change. Thus, we identify two
classes of tipping points to extinction: bifurcation-induced tipping
(B-tipping) when the shrinking habitat falls below some critical length, and
rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) when the shifting habitat exceeds some
critical speed. We explore two-parameter R-tipping diagrams to understand how
the critical speed depends on the size of the habitat patch and the dispersal
rate of the population, uncover parameter regions where the shifting population
survives, and relate these regions to the invasion speed in an infinite
homogeneous habitat. Furthermore, we contrast the tipping instabilities with
regime-shift instabilities found for logistic population growth without the
Allee effect.

the inflation scalar field as the matter and taking into account only the

for increasing the sample rate of low sample trajectories. Currently, most
existing works on trajectory recovery follow a sequence-to-sequence diagram,
with an encoder to encode a trajectory and a decoder to recover real GPS points
in the trajectory. However, these works ignore the topology of road network and
only use grid information or raw GPS points as input. Therefore, the encoder
model is not able to capture rich spatial information of the GPS points along

a Sub-Graph Generation module to capture the spatial features for each GPS

to holding both answer discrimination and answer generation seamlessly by
different attention masks. Specifically, in order to make the original
discriminative model compatible with answer generation, we design novel

learning a programming course. The study utilized mixed method research applied
through a validated survey questionnaire consisting of closed and open ended
questions. Python programming was the course selected to undergo the study and
underwent an evaluation to determine the students' responses. Student
respondents are from Bulacan State University, a state university in the
Philippines, under the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program.
Based on their responses, the students found that the online Python programming
was Very Effective, with an overall mean of 4.49. This result shows that
students found the online course effective, provided the proper course design
and content, allowed them to spend enough time finishing tasks, and provided
communication and interaction with their instructor and fellow students.
Additionally, students gave overwhelmingly positive responses when asked what
their instructors had done well on the course delivery and provided insightful
and constructive comments for further enhancement and delivery of the course.
This study found that most students strongly agreed and believed in the
effectiveness of delivering the Python Programming course asynchronously. With
such positive results from the student's perspective and evaluation, the course
can be enhanced to continue providing quality education at Bulacan State
University.

utilization. The real-world wind speed data is typically intermittent and
fluctuating, presenting great challenges to existing shallow models. In this
paper, we present a novel deep hybrid model for multi-step wind speed
prediction, namely LR-FFT-RP-MLP/LSTM (Linear Fast Fourier Transformation Rank
Pooling Multiple-Layer Perception/Long Short-Term Memory). Our hybrid model
processes the local and global input features simultaneously. We leverage Rank
Pooling (RP) for the local feature extraction to capture the temporal structure
while maintaining the temporal order. Besides, to understand the wind periodic
patterns, we exploit Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to extract global
features and relevant frequency components in the wind speed data. The
resulting local and global features are respectively integrated with the
original data and are fed into an MLP/LSTM layer for the initial wind speed
predictions. Finally, we leverage a linear regression layer to collaborate
these initial predictions to produce the final wind speed prediction. The
proposed hybrid model is evaluated using real wind speed data collected from
2010 to 2020, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities when compared to
state-of-the-art single and hybrid models. Overall, this study presents a
promising approach for improving the accuracy of wind speed forecasting.

values depending on their folded state. Most studies on the Poisson effects in
deployable origami tessellations are restricted to theory and simulation.
Experimental realization of the desired Poisson effects in origami
metamaterials requires special attention to the boundary conditions to enable
deployable nonlinear deformations that give rise to tunability. In this work,
we present a novel experimental setup suitable to study the Poisson effects in
2D origami tessellations that undergo simultaneous deformations in both the
applied and transverse directions. The setup comprises a gripping mechanism,
which we call a Saint-Venant fixture, to eliminate Saint-Venant end effects
during uniaxial testing experiment. Using this setup, we conduct Poisson's
ratio measurements of the Morph origami pattern whose configuration space
combines features of the Miura-ori and Eggbox parent patterns. We
experimentally observe the Poisson's ratio sign switching capability of the
Morph pattern, along with its ability to display either completely positive or
completely negative values of Poisson's ratio by virtue of topological
transformations. To demonstrate the versatility of the novel setup we also
perform experiments on the standard Miura-ori and the standard Eggbox patterns.
Our results demonstrate the agreement between the theory, the simulations, and
the experiments on the Poisson's ratio measurement and its tunability in
origami metamaterials. The proposed experimental technique can be adopted for
investigating other tunable properties of origami metamaterials in static and
in dynamic regimes, such as finite-strain Poisson's ratios, elastic thermal
expansion, and wave propagation control.

wide range of NN model checkers and reachability analysis tools. Given a
bounded input set, bound propagation algorithms aim to compute tight bounds on
the output of the NN. So far, linear and convex optimizations have been used to
perform bound propagation. Since neural networks are highly non-convex,
state-of-the-art bound propagation techniques suffer from introducing large
errors. To circumvent such drawback, BERN-NN approximates the bounds of each

polynomials enjoy several interesting properties that allow BERN-NN to obtain
tighter bounds compared to those relying on linear and convex approximations.
BERN-NN is efficiently parallelized on graphic processing units (GPUs).
Extensive numerical results show that bounds obtained by BERN-NN are orders of

availability of multiple modalities, as provided, for example, in the

research approaches use both acoustic and visual information from the MELD
videos. There are two reasons for this: First, label-to-video alignments in
MELD are noisy, making those videos an unreliable source of emotional speech
data. Second, conversations can involve several people in the same scene, which
requires the localisation of the utterance source. In this paper, we introduce
MELD with Fixed Audiovisual Information via Realignment (MELD-FAIR) by using
recent active speaker detection and automatic speech recognition models, we are
able to realign the videos of MELD and capture the facial expressions from
speakers in 96.92% of the utterances provided in MELD. Experiments with a
self-supervised voice recognition model indicate that the realigned MELD-FAIR

Finally, we devise a model for emotion recognition in conversations trained on
the realigned MELD-FAIR videos, which outperforms state-of-the-art models for

speaking activities is indeed effective for extracting facial expressions from

  In this thesis, I implement parallel versions of some Kernelization
algorithms and evaluate their performance. The performance of Kernelization
algorithms is measured either by the size of the output Kernel or by the time
it takes to compute the kernel. Sometimes the Kernel is the same as the

diary-based surveys and few exist in the Global South or tailored to vulnerable
populations. In particular, no contact matrices exist for refugee settlements -
locations under-served by epidemic models in general. In this paper we present
a novel, mixed-method approach, for deriving contact matrices in populations
which combines a lightweight, rapidly deployable, survey with an agent-based
model of the population informed by census and behavioural data. We use this
method to derive the first set of contact matrices for the Cox's Bazar refugee
settlement in Bangladesh. The matrices from the refugee settlement show strong
banding effects due to different age cut-offs in attendance at certain venues,
such as distribution centres and religious sites, as well as the important
contribution of the demographic profile of the settlement which was encoded in
the model. These can have significant implications to the modelled disease
dynamics. To validate our approach, we also apply our method to the population
of the UK and compare our derived matrices against well-known contact matrices
previously collected using traditional approaches. Overall, our findings
demonstrate that our mixed-method approach can address some of the challenges
of both the traditional and previously proposed agent-based approaches to
deriving contact matrices, and has the potential to be rolled-out in other
resource-constrained environments. This work therefore contributes to a broader
aim of developing new methods and mechanisms of data collection for modelling

increase in modeling and analyzing brain activity in terms of a graph or
network. Since graph models facilitate a systems-theoretic explanation of the
brain, they have become increasingly relevant with advances in network science
and the popularization of complex systems theory. The purpose of this study is
to look into the abnormalities in resting brain functions in adults with
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The primary goal is to
investigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC), which can be construed
as a significant temporal coincidence in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)
signals between functionally related brain regions in the absence of any
stimulus or task. When compared to healthy controls, ADHD patients have lower
average connectivity in the Supramarginal Gyrus and Superior Parietal Lobule,
but higher connectivity in the Lateral Occipital Cortex and Inferior Temporal
Gyrus. We also hypothesize that the network organization of default mode and
dorsal attention regions is abnormal in ADHD patients.

challenging to achieve both high performance and power efficiency due to the
memory wall bottleneck. Computing-in-memory (CiM) is a promising mitigation
approach by enabling parallel in-situ multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations
within the memory with support from the peripheral interface and datapath.
SRAM-based charge-domain CiM (CD-CiM) has shown its potential of enhanced power
efficiency and computing accuracy. However, existing SRAM-based CD-CiM faces
scaling challenges to meet the throughput requirement of high-performance
multi-bit-quantization applications. This paper presents an SRAM-based
high-throughput ReLU-optimized CD-CiM macro. It is capable of completing MAC
and ReLU of two signed 8b vectors in one CiM cycle with only one A/D
conversion. Along with non-linearity compensation for the analog computing and
A/D conversion interfaces, this work achieves 51.2GOPS throughput and
10.3TOPS/W energy efficiency, while showing 88.6% accuracy in the CIFAR-10
dataset.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperative beamforming design has been recognized as an effective approach
in modern wireless networks to meet the dramatically increasing demand of
various wireless data traffics. It is formulated as an optimization problem in
conventional approaches and solved iteratively in an instance-by-instance
manner. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged with real-time
implementation by approximating the mapping function from the problem instances
to the corresponding solutions. Among various neural network architectures,
graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively utilize the graph topology in
wireless networks to achieve better generalization ability on unseen problem
sizes. However, the current GNNs are only equipped with the node-update
mechanism, which restricts it from modeling more complicated problems such as
the cooperative beamforming design, where the beamformers are on the graph
edges of wireless networks. To fill this gap, we propose an
edge-graph-neural-network (Edge-GNN) by incorporating an edge-update mechanism
into the GNN, which learns the cooperative beamforming on the graph edges.
Simulation results show that the proposed Edge-GNN achieves higher sum rate
with much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art approaches, and
generalizes well to different numbers of base stations and user equipments.

RegTraffic, a novel interactive traffic simulator that integrates dynamic
regression-based spatiotemporal traffic analysis to predict congestion of
intercorrelated road segments. The simulator models traffic congestion of road
segments depending on neighboring road links and temporal features of the
dynamic traffic flow. The simulator provides a user-friendly web interface to
select road segments of interest, receive user-defined traffic parameters, and
visualize the traffic for the flow of correlated road links based on the user
inputs and the underlying correlation of these road links. Performance
evaluation shows that RegTraffic can effectively predict traffic congestion
with a Mean Squared Error of 1.3 Km/h and a Root Mean Squared Error of 1.71
Km/h. RegTraffic can effectively simulate the results and provide visualization
on interactive geographical maps.

been the cornerstone of most electroencephalography (EEG) studies. The abnormal
oscillations in high-frequency waves associated with psychotic disorders during
sensory and cognitive tasks have been studied many times. However, any
significant dissimilarity in the resting-state low-frequency bands is yet to be
established. Spectral analysis of the alpha and delta band waves shows the
effectiveness of stimulus-independent EEG in identifying the abnormal activity
patterns of pathological brains. A generalized model incorporating multiple
frequency bands should be more efficient in associating potential EEG
biomarkers with First-Episode Psychosis (FEP), leading to an accurate
diagnosis. We explore multiple machine-learning methods, including
random-forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC),
to demonstrate the practicality of resting-state Power Spectral Density (PSD)
to distinguish patients of FEP from healthy controls. A comprehensive
discussion of our preprocessing methods for PSD analysis and a detailed
comparison of different models are included in this paper. The GPC model
outperforms the other models with a specificity of 95.78% to show that PSD can
be used as an effective feature extraction technique for analyzing and
classifying resting-state EEG signals of psychiatric disorders.

continuously generate and exchange information through various forms of
interactions, some of which are yet to be discovered. Internet of Everything
(IoE) framework, inspired by the ubiquitous and adaptive connectivity and the
seamless interoperability within this universal network, puts forward a new
road map beyond the conventional Internet of Things (IoT) towards maximizing
the resolution of our interface with the universe to enable unprecedented
applications. The first pillar of this road map is to reveal novel and tangible
interconnections between seemingly noninteracting branches of IoT, which we
call IoXs with X referring to their application domains, e.g., Internet of
Energy (IoEn), Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The second pillar is to develop new
IoXs that can complement the existing ones to complete the overall IoE picture
and match its networking traits to that of the universe for a seamless and
all-embracing cyber-physical interface. The objective of this paper is to
evaluate the potential of this holistic IoE approach to expand the limited
application landscape of the current IoT practice on a scale ranging
$\textit{from molecules to the universe}$. To this end, we identify several
potential interaction pathways among IoXs and introduce novel and emerging IoXs
that are essential to the comprehensiveness of IoE. We also discuss the
potential applications that can be enabled by such interconnections within the
IoE framework and identify the associated challenges.
