investigated the temporal and spectral behaviour of the source for over about
10 days. The X-ray light curve obtained from the XMM-Newton observation with an
28 ks exposure revealed a type-I X-ray burst with a peak bolometric luminosity
of at least 1.4e37 erg/s. The burst energetics are consistent with a location
of the burster at the distance of the Magellanic Bridge. The relatively long
exponential decay time of the burst of 70 s indicates that it ignited in a
H-rich environment. The non-detection of the source during the other eROSITA
surveys, twelve and six months before and six months after eRASS3, suggests
that the burst was discovered during a moderate outburst which reached 2.6e36
erg/s in persistent emission. During the NICER observations, the source showed
alternating flux states with the high level at a similar brightness as during
the XMM-Newton observation. This behaviour is likely caused by dips as also
seen during the last hour of the XMM-Newton observation. Evidence for a
recurrence of the dips with a period of 21.8 hr suggests eRASSt

computer vision and graphics, with increasing attention focused on garment
representation learning, garment reconstruction, and controllable garment
manipulation, whereas existing methods were constrained to model garments under
specific categories or with relatively simple topologies. In this paper, we
propose a novel Neural Sewing Machine (NSM), a learning-based framework for
structure-preserving 3D garment modeling, which is capable of learning
representations for garments with diverse shapes and topologies and is
successfully applied to 3D garment reconstruction and controllable
manipulation. To model generic garments, we first obtain sewing pattern
embedding via a unified sewing pattern encoding module, as the sewing pattern
can accurately describe the intrinsic structure and the topology of the 3D
garment. Then we use a 3D garment decoder to decode the sewing pattern
embedding into a 3D garment using the UV-position maps with masks. To preserve
the intrinsic structure of the predicted 3D garment, we introduce an
inner-panel structure-preserving loss, an inter-panel structure-preserving
loss, and a surface-normal loss in the learning process of our framework. We
evaluate NSM on the public 3D garment dataset with sewing patterns with diverse
garment shapes and categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed NSM is capable of representing 3D garments under diverse garment
shapes and topologies, realistically reconstructing 3D garments from 2D images
with the preserved structure, and accurately manipulating the 3D garment
categories, shapes, and topologies, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods

supercurrent in such wire Josephson junctions as a function of the axial

current flows on average parallel to the magnetic field we observe $h/2e$,
$h/4e$- and even $h/8e$-periodic oscillations of the supercurrent in samples

scheme for image transmission over a half-duplex cooperative relay channel.
Specifically, we apply DeepJSCC to two basic modes of cooperative

DeepJSCC-AF, the relay simply amplifies and forwards its received signal. In
DeepJSCC-DF, on the other hand, the relay first reconstructs the transmitted
image and then re-encodes it before forwarding. Considering the excessive
computation overhead of DeepJSCC-DF for recovering the image at the relay, we
propose an alternative scheme, called DeepJSCC-PF, in which the relay processes
and forwards its received signal without necessarily recovering the image.
Simulation results show that the proposed DeepJSCC-AF, DF, and PF schemes are
superior to the digital baselines with BPG compression with polar codes and
provides a graceful performance degradation with deteriorating channel quality.
Further investigation shows that the PSNR gain of DeepJSCC-DF/PF over
DeepJSCC-AF improves as the channel condition between the source and relay
improves. Moreover, DeepJSCC-PF scheme achieves a similar performance to
DeepJSCC-DF with lower computational complexity.

generate an induced gap in the semiconductor. The magnitude of this induced
gap, together with the semiconductor properties like the spin-orbit coupling
and $g$\,-\,factor, depends on the coupling between the materials. It is
predicted that this coupling can be adjusted through the use of electric
fields. We study this phenomena in InSb/Al/Pt hybrids using nonlocal
spectroscopy. We show that these hybrids can be tuned such that the
semiconductor and superconductor are strongly coupled. In this case, the
induced gap is similar to the superconducting gap in the Al/Pt shell and closes
only at high magnetic fields. In contrast, the coupling can be suppressed which
leads to a strong reduction of the induced gap and critical magnetic field. At
the crossover between the strong-coupling and weak-coupling regimes, we observe
the closing and reopening of the induced gap in the bulk of a nanowire.
Contrary to expectations, it is not accompanied by the formation of zero-bias
peaks in the local conductance spectra. As a result, this cannot be attributed
conclusively to the anticipated topological phase transition and we discuss
possible alternative explanations.

results. This paper develops a robust generalized DID method that utilizes all
the information available not only from the pre-treatment periods but also from
multiple data sources. Our approach interprets PT in a different way using a
notion of selection bias, which enables us to generalize the standard DID
estimand by defining an information set that may contain multiple pre-treatment

selection bias in the post-treatment period lies within the convex hull of all

Therefore, we demonstrate a series of simulations aimed at the calculation of

the triple point temperature as in a corresponding states plot we find
TIP4P/Ice compares very well with TIP4P/2005 and to experiment. Such

parameters within piecewise function approximations to generate dense candidate
model spaces. These innovations allow handling many compatible and embedded
candidate models, possibly none of which are accurate, and learning elusive
unknown functional forms. Our new methodology is generalizable, interpretable,
and extrapolates out of the space of models to discover new ones. We perform a
series of twin experiments based on flows past a ridge coupled with
three-to-five component ecosystem models, including flows with chaotic
advection. The probabilities of known, uncertain, and unknown model
formulations, and of state fields and parameters, are updated jointly using
Bayes' law. Non-Gaussian statistics, ambiguity, and biases are captured. The
parameter values and model formulations that best explain the data are
identified. When observations are sufficiently informative, model complexity
and functions are discovered.

called MaskNet to mask the data before transmission. PriMask significantly
weakens the cloud's capability to recover the data or extract certain private
attributes. The MaskNet is em cascadable in that the mobile can opt in to or
out of its use seamlessly without any modifications to the cloud's inference

between the cloud and some mobiles does not weaken the protection for other
mobiles. We devise a {\em split adversarial learning} method to train a neural

We apply PriMask to three mobile sensing applications with diverse modalities

test that is used to detect any heart-related disease. ECG signals are
generally stored in paper form, which makes it difficult to store and analyze
the data. While capturing ECG leads from paper ECG records, a lot of background
information is also captured, which results in incorrect data interpretation.
  Methods: We propose a deep learning-based model for individually extracting
all 12 leads from 12-lead ECG images captured using a camera. To simplify the
analysis of the ECG and the calculation of complex parameters, we also propose
a method to convert the paper ECG format into a storable digital format. The
You Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm has been used to extract the
leads present in the image. These leads are then passed on to another deep
learning model which separates the ECG signal and background from the
single-lead image. After that, vertical scanning is performed on the ECG signal
to convert it into a 1-Dimensional (1D) digital form. To perform the task of
digitalization, we used the pix-2-pix deep learning model and binarized the ECG
signals.
  Results: Our proposed method was able to achieve an accuracy of 97.4 %.
  Conclusion: The information on the paper ECG fades away over time. Hence, the
digitized ECG signals make it possible to store the records and access them
anytime. This proves highly beneficial for heart patients who require frequent
ECG reports. The stored data can also be useful for research purposes, as this
data can be used to develop computer algorithms that are capable of analyzing
the data.

data collected from human subjects performing simulated urban search and rescue

high-resolution extractor encodes dynamically changing goals robustly by taking
as input the Manhattan distance difference between the humans' Minecraft

computed from a high-resolution gridworld representation. In contrast, the
low-resolution extractor encodes participants' historical behavior using a
historical state matrix computed from a low-resolution graph representation.
Through supervised learning, our model acquires a robust prior for human

experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves

multi-product algorithm that is a linear combination of multiple
Trotterizations has been proposed to improve the approximation accuracy.
Implementing such multi-product Trotterization in quantum computers however
remains experimentally challenging and its success probability is limited.
Here, we modify the multi-product Trotterization and combine it with the
oblivious amplitude amplification to simultaneously reach a high simulation
precision and high success probability. We experimentally implement the
modified multi-product algorithm in an integrated-photonics programmable
quantum simulator in silicon, which allows the initialization, manipulation and
measurement of four-qubit states and a sequence of linearly combined
controlled-unitary gates, to emulate the dynamics of a coupled electron and
nuclear spins system. Theoretical and experimental results are in good
agreement, and they both show the modified multi-product algorithm can simulate
Hamiltonian dynamics with a higher precision than conventional Trotterizations

the design of distributed/decentralized controllers; however, the guarantees of
the proper execution of the controls are also essential but relatively less
emphasized. A common assumption is that local controllers would fully follow
the designated controller dynamics based on the data received from
communication channels. Such an assumption could be risky because proper
execution of the controller dynamics is then built on trust in secure
communication and computation. On the other hand, it is impractical for a
verifier to repeat all the computations involved in the controls to verify the
computational integrity. In this work, we leverage a type of cryptography
technology, known as zero-knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge
to verify the computational integrity of control algorithms, such that
verifiers can check the computational integrity with much less computational
burden. The method presented here converts the challenge of data integrity into
a subset of computational integrity. In this proof-of-concept paper, our focus

distributed/decentralized power system controllers. In particular, we have

object detection is paramount to automatically procure accurate readings on the
location and thickness of calcifications within the artery. Deep learning-based
object detection methods have been explored in a variety of applications. The
quality of object detection predictions could lead to uncertain results, which
are not desirable in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we implement an
object detection model, You-Only-Look-Once v5 (YOLO), on a calcification
detection framework within coronary OCT images. We evaluate the uncertainty of
predictions based on the expected calibration errors, thus assessing the
certainty level of detection results. To calibrate confidence scores of
predictions, we implement dependent logistic calibration using each detection
result's confidence and center coordinates. With the calibrated confidence
score of each prediction, we lower the uncertainty of predictions in
calcification detection. Our results show that the YOLO achieves higher
precision and recall in comparison with the other object detection model,
meanwhile producing more reliable results. The calibrated confidence of
prediction results in a confidence error of approximately 0.13, suggesting that

paper will introduce a physics-based approach based on field theory as a new
tool for crowd analysis to determine governing differential equations.
Formulating the pedestrian movement with differential equations has a primary
advantage for data assimilation techniques because some of these methods only
work with models with analytical transition functions, which are obtained by
incorporating a field approach. Furthermore, the field approach provides more
generality since the field could be any scalar field. Several Lagrangians are
presented in this work, and the primary purpose was to lay the groundwork for
this new type of thinking. Furthermore, as pedestrian movement is mainly
unregulated, the approach presented in the paper can be valuable for future
development since the Lagrangian could be explicitly obtained for pedestrian
movement spaces such as train stations and shopping malls. Finally, we discuss
a general approach for predicting the action and how neural networks might play
a role, which brings more flexibility and extendibility to our approach.

evaluate the performance of the CompactChain in terms of time taken by a miner

network compression, reducing the FLOPs of the original model by a large
extent. However, such levels of compression are often accompanied by a
significant drop in the performance. There exist some approaches that reduce
this performance drop by facilitating partial binarization of the network,
however, a systematic approach to mix binary and full-precision parameters in a
single network is still missing. In this paper, we propose a paradigm to
perform partial binarization of neural networks in a controlled sense, thereby
constructing budgeted binary neural network (B2NN). We present MixBin, an
iterative search-based strategy that constructs B2NN through optimized mixing
of the binary and full-precision components. MixBin allows to explicitly choose
the approximate fraction of the network to be kept as binary, thereby
presenting the flexibility to adapt the inference cost at a prescribed budget.
We demonstrate through experiments that B2NNs obtained from our MixBin strategy
are significantly better than those obtained from random selection of the
network layers. To perform partial binarization in an effective manner, it is
important that both the full-precision as well as the binary components of the
B2NN are appropriately optimized. We also demonstrate that the choice of the
activation function can have a significant effect on this process, and to
circumvent this issue, we present BinReLU, that can be used as an effective
activation function for the full-precision as well as the binary components of
any B2NN. Experimental investigations reveal that BinReLU outperforms the other
activation functions in all possible scenarios of B2NN: zero-, partial- as well
as full binarization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of MixBin on the
tasks of classification and object tracking using benchmark datasets.

of videos (e.g., Youtube, Hulu) are uploaded online every day. The extraction
of representative key frames from videos is very important in video processing
and analysis since it greatly reduces computing resources and time. Although
great progress has been made recently, large-scale video classification remains
an open problem, as the existing methods have not well balanced the performance
and efficiency simultaneously. To tackle this problem, this work presents an
unsupervised method to retrieve the key frames, which combines Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and Temporal Segment Density Peaks Clustering (TSDPC). The
proposed TSDPC is a generic and powerful framework and it has two advantages
compared with previous works, one is that it can calculate the number of key
frames automatically. The other is that it can preserve the temporal
information of the video. Thus it improves the efficiency of video
classification. Furthermore, a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is added
on the top of the CNN to further elevate the performance of classification.
Moreover, a weight fusion strategy of different input networks is presented to
boost the performance. By optimizing both video classification and key frame
extraction simultaneously, we achieve better classification performance and
higher efficiency. We evaluate our method on two popular datasets (i.e., HMDB51

problem with this approach is that data zeros, found in most applications, have
to be replaced to permit the logarithmic transformation. A simpler approach is
to use the chi-square standardization that is inherent in correspondence
analysis. Combined with the Box-Cox power transformation, this standardization
defines chi-square distances that tend to logratio distances for strictly
positive data as the power parameter tends to zero, and can thus be considered
equivalent to transforming to logratios. For data with zeros, a value of the
power can be identified that brings the chi-square standardization as close as

a dataset of clean/corrupted image pairs and no knowledge about the corruption

requires only low levels of added noise, and thus needs comparatively few
sampling steps even without further optimizations.

the MBO scheme are integrated with state-of-the-art techniques, including a
home-made transformer and an autoencoder, in order to deal with
scarcely-labeled data sets. In addition, a consensus technique is detailed. The
proposed models are validated using five benchmark data sets. We also provide a
thorough comparison to other competing methods, such as support vector
machines, random forests, and gradient boosting decision trees, which are known
for their good performance on small data sets. The performances of various
methods are analyzed using residue-similarity (R-S) scores and R-S indices.
Extensive computational experiments and theoretical analysis show that the new

Obtaining precise mathematical models is difficult, and the mismatch between
the model and the real physical system is not trivial. The large model-plant
mismatch significantly degrades overall system performance if a non-adaptive
model predictive controller (MPC) is used. This work presents the
$\mathcal{L}_1$-MPC, an adaptive nonlinear model predictive controller for
accurate 6-DOF trajectory tracking of an overactuated tiltrotor hexacopter in
the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. The
$\mathcal{L}_1$-MPC adopts a cascaded system architecture in which a nominal
MPC is followed and augmented by an $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive controller. The
proposed method is evaluated against the non-adaptive MPC, the EKF-MPC, and the
PID method in both numerical and PX4 software-in-the-loop simulation with
Gazebo. The $\mathcal{L}_1$-MPC reduces the tracking error by around 90% when

errors, higher uncertainty estimation rates, and less tuning requirements over
the EKF-MPC. We will make the implementations, including the hardware-verified

representation vectors produced by a DCNN similar to AlexNet to match patients

However, the architecture and dataset used for transfer learning in
GestaltMatcher have become outdated. Moreover, a way to train the model for
generating better representation vectors for unseen ultra-rare disorders has
not yet been studied. Because of the overall scarcity of patients with
ultra-rare disorders, it is infeasible to directly train a model on them.
Therefore, we first analyzed the influence of replacing GestaltMatcher DCNN

Additionally, we experimented with different face recognition datasets for
transfer learning. Furthermore, we proposed test-time augmentation, and model
ensembles that mix general face verification models and models specific for

Such a hot spot may form as the exhaust of magnetic reconnection in a current

sheet into an orbit in the accretion disk may shear and diffuse due to
instabilities at its boundary during its orbit, resulting in a distinct
signature. We subdivide the motion to two distinct phases; the first phase
refers to the appearance of the hot spot modelled as a bright blob, followed by
a subsequent shearing phase simulated as a stretched ellipse. We employ
different observational arrays, including EHT(2017,2022) and the next
generation event horizon telescope (ngEHTp1, ngEHT) arrays, in which few new
additional sites are added to the observational array. We make dynamical image
reconstructions for each of these arrays. Subsequently, we infer the hot spot
phase in the first phase followed by the axes ratio and the ellipse area in the
second phase. We focus on the direct observability of the orbiting hot spot in
the sub-mm wavelength. Our analysis demonstrates that newly added dishes may
easily trace the first phase as well as part of the second phase, before the
flux is reduced substantially. The algorithm used in this work can be extended
to any other types of the dynamical motion. Consequently, we conclude that the

fueled by the unprecedented, uniform, and extended observations of solar

(CMEs) from closed magnetic field regions and high speed streams (HSS) from
open field regions on the Sun account for most of the disturbances relevant to
space weather. The main consequences of CMEs and HSS are their ability to cause
geomagnetic storms and accelerate particles. Particles accelerated by CME
driven shocks can pose danger to humans and their technological structures in
space. Geomagnetic storms produced by CMEs and HSS related stream interaction
regions also result in particle energization inside the magnetosphere that can
have severe impact on satellites operating in the magnetosphere. Solar flares
are another aspect of solar magnetic energy release, mostly characterized by
the sudden enhancement in electromagnetic emission at various wavelengths from
radio waves to gamma rays. Flares are responsible for the sudden ionospheric
disturbances and prompt perturbation of Earths magnetic field known as magnetic

s-process elements. Chemical abundance analysis of barium stars can provide
crucial clues for the study of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The Large
Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) has released more
than 6 million low-resolution spectra of FGK-type stars by Data Release 9
(DR9), which can significantly increase the sample size of barium stars. In
this paper, we used machine learning algorithms to search for barium stars from
low-resolution spectra of LAMOST. We have applied the Light Gradient Boosting
Machine (LGBM) algorithm to build classifiers of barium stars based on
different features, and build predictors for determining [Ba/Fe] and [Sr/Fe] of
barium candidates. The classification with features in the whole spectrum
performs best: for the sample with strontium enhancement, Precision = 97.81%,
and Recall = 96.05%; for the sample with barium enhancement, Precision = 96.03%
and Recall = 97.70%. In prediction, [Ba/Fe] estimated from BaII line at 4554
\r{A} has smaller dispersion than that from BaII line at 4934 \r{A}: MAE$_{4554
\r{A}}$ = 0.07, $\sigma_{4554 \r{A}}$ = 0.12. [Sr/Fe] estimated from SrII line
at 4077 \r{A} performs better than that from SrII line at 4215 \r{A}:
MAE$_{4077 \r{A}}$ = 0.09, $\sigma_{4077 \r{A}}$ = 0.16. A comparison of the
LGBM and other popular algorithms shows that LGBM is accurate and efficient in
classifying barium stars. This work demonstrated that machine learning can be
used as an effective means to identify chemically peculiar stars and determine
their elemental abundance.

Marangoni flow in liquid metals (i.e., liquid-gallium) with Laguerre-gaussian
(LG) lasers as heating sources, is an effective approach to overcome Brownian
forces on particles, giving rise to predictable assemblies with high degree of

liquid-gallium using non-gaussian LG lasers, the Marangoni and convective flow
that develops in the fluid drives the trajectory of randomly dispersed
particles to assemble into 100 um wide ring-shaped particle assemblies. Careful
control over the parameters of the LG laser (i.e., laser mode, spot size, and
intensity of the electric field) can tune the temperature and fluid dynamics of
the liquid-gallium as well as the balance of forces on the particle. This in
turn can tune the structure of the ring-shaped particle assembly with a high
degree of fidelity. The use of light to control the motion of particles in
liquid metals represents a tunable and rapidly reconfigurable approach to

entrapment during the impact of droplets on a liquid pool are studied by
combined experimental measurements and numerical simulations. The time
evolution of the free surface profile obtained in the numerical simulation is
in good agreement with the experimental results. The cavity created by the
droplet impact affects the pinch-off of regular bubbles and the entrapment of
large bubbles. The regular bubble pinch-off is the direct consequence of the
capillary wave propagating downward along the interface of the cavity and
merging at the bottom of the cavity. In contrast, the large bubble entrapment
is due to the merging of the liquid crowns at the mouth of the cavity. Gravity
and environmental pressure play important roles in cavity deformation and
bubble entrapment after droplet impact on liquid pools. The maximum depth of
the cavity decreases as the gravitational effect becomes stronger. The
phenomenon of regular bubble pinch-off may disappear as the gravity decreases.
We find that the regular bubble pinch-off can transform into large bubble
entrapment when increasing environmental pressure. The size of the large bubble
entrapped decreases with increasing the environmental pressure due to the
larger difference in the pressure and the vorticity around the liquid crown at
increased environmental pressure. Finally, the regime map of bubble entrapment
after the droplet impact is obtained.

at the ENZ point, which gave rise to the generation of surface plasmon waves,
has been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated for the first time, to
the best of our knowledge. Specifically, this ENZ effect was accompanied with
THz modulations along the plasma filament in multiple domains, including the
linear-to-elliptical THz polarization conversion and the multi-ring pattern of
far-field THz profiles, etc. Thanks to these novel ENZ-induced phenomena, the
understanding of this important plasma-based THz source has been enriched.
Moreover, by extending the laser plasma to the role of ENZ material, it is
promising to expedite related applications benefiting from the ENZ nature,
e.g., the strong spatial confinement of THz waves inside the ENZ region between
the bi-filaments array, which realized all-optical time-domain integration of
broadband THz pulses as we recently displayed in [arXiv].

the time. Like human vision system (HVS), machine vision system (MVS) is
sensitive to image quality, as quality degradation leads to information loss
and recognition failure. In recent years, MVS-targeted image processing,
particularly image and video compression, has emerged. However, existing
methods only target an individual machine rather than the general machine
community, thus cannot satisfy every type of machine. Moreover, the MVS
characteristics are not well leveraged, which limits compression efficiency. In
this paper, we introduce a new concept, Satisfied Machine Ratio (SMR), to
address these issues. SMR statistically measures the image quality from the
machine's perspective by collecting and combining satisfaction scores from a
large quantity and variety of machine subjects, where such scores are obtained
with MVS characteristics considered properly. We create the first large-scale
SMR dataset that contains over 22 million annotated images for SMR studies.
Furthermore, a deep learning-based model is proposed to predict the SMR for any
given compressed image or video frame. Extensive experiments show that using
the SMR model can significantly improve the performance of machine
recognition-oriented image and video compression. And the SMR model generalizes
well to unseen machines, compression frameworks, and datasets.

  abstract, literature review included in the Introduction, discussion of
  ""hidden'' symmetries in Sec. IV extended",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1964, Lipkin discovered a set of conserved quantities for free
electromagnetism without a clear physical interpretation, known as the zilches.
In 2010, Tang and Cohen realized that one of the zilches, termed as optical
chirality, provides a measure of the handedness of light. Although the zilch
symmetries of Maxwell's equations in terms of the electromagnetic (EM) tensor
are known, the question of how to derive all zilch conservation laws from
symmetries of the standard EM action using Noether's theorem has been answered
only in the case of optical chirality. In this Letter, we provide the full
answer by showing that the zilch symmetry transformations of the 4-potential,
$A_{\mu}$, leave invariant the standard EM action.
  In the rest of the article, we provide new insight concerning the
conservation of the zilches and their underlying symmetries. First, we show
that the zilch symmetries belong to the enveloping algebra of a ``hidden''
invariance algebra of free Maxwell's equations in potential form. The
``hidden'' algebra closes on $so(6,\mathbb{C})_{\mathbb{R}}$ up to gauge
transformations of $A_{\mu}$. The generators of the ``hidden'' algebra consist
of familiar conformal symmetry transformations and certain ``hidden'' symmetry
transformations of $A_{\mu}$. We discuss the generalization of these ``hidden''
symmetries in the presence of a material 4-current, $J^{\mu}$. The ``hidden''
symmetries are also discussed for the theory of a complex Abelian gauge field.
Finally, we show that the zilch symmetries of the standard free EM action can
be extended to symmetries of the standard interacting action by considering
simultaneous transformations of $A_{\mu}$ and $J^{\mu}$. This allows us to give
a new derivation of the continuity equation for optical chirality in the
presence of electric charges and currents, while we also derive new continuity
equations for the rest of the zilches.

Accumulated errors over multiple reaction cycles prevent the synthesis of
longer oligonucleotides for the genome scale engineering of synthetic

poorly understood. Here we show that bead-bead stacking significantly
contributes to reaction errors in columns by analyzing enzymatic coupling of
fluorescently labelled nucleotides onto the initiated beads along with
porosity, particle tracking and diffusion calculations. To circumvent stacking,
we introduce dielectrophoretic bead-droplet reactor (DBDR); a novel approach to
synthesize on individual microbeads within microdroplets. Dielectrophoretic
force overcomes the droplet-medium interfacial tension to encapsulate and eject
individual beads from microdroplets in a droplet microfluidic device. Faster
reagent diffusion in droplets, and non-uniform electric field induced
enhancement in reagent concentration at its surface can improve reaction
fidelities in DBDR. Fluorescence comparisons suggest around 3-fold enhancement
of reaction fidelity compared to columns. DBDR can potentially enable the
high-purity synthesis of arbitrarily long strands of DNA to meet the emerging

growing interest in machine learning due to its demonstrable efficacy for tasks
such as noisy label detection. In particular, due to the desirable axiomatic
properties, several Shapley value approximation methods have been proposed. In
these methods, the value function is typically defined as the predictive
accuracy over the entire development set. However, this limits the ability to
differentiate between training instances that are helpful or harmful to their
own classes. Intuitively, instances that harm their own classes may be noisy or
mislabeled and should receive a lower valuation than helpful instances. In this
work, we propose CS-Shapley, a Shapley value with a new value function that
discriminates between training instances' in-class and out-of-class
contributions. Our theoretical analysis shows the proposed value function is
(essentially) the unique function that satisfies two desirable properties for
evaluating data values in classification. Further, our experiments on two
benchmark evaluation tasks (data removal and noisy label detection) and four
classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of CS-Shapley over existing methods.
Lastly, we evaluate the ""transferability"" of data values estimated from one
classifier to others, and our results suggest Shapley-based data valuation is
transferable for application across different models.

the one with low bit width numbers, in order to accelerate inference and reduce
computation. Quantizing a model without access to the original data, zero-shot
quantization can be accomplished by fitting the real data distribution by data
synthesis. However, zero-shot quantization achieves inferior performance
compared to the post-training quantization with real data. We find it is
because: 1) a normal generator is hard to obtain high diversity of synthetic
data, since it lacks long-range information to allocate attention to global
features; 2) the synthetic images aim to simulate the statistics of real data,
which leads to weak intra-class heterogeneity and limited feature richness. To
overcome these problems, we propose a novel deep network quantizer, dubbed
Long-Range Zero-Shot Generative Deep Network Quantization (LRQ). Technically,
we propose a long-range generator to learn long-range information instead of
simple local features. In order for the synthetic data to contain more global
features, long-range attention using large kernel convolution is incorporated
into the generator. In addition, we also present an Adversarial Margin Add
(AMA) module to force intra-class angular enlargement between feature vector
and class center. As AMA increases the convergence difficulty of the loss
function, which is opposite to the training objective of the original loss
function, it forms an adversarial process. Furthermore, in order to transfer
knowledge from the full-precision network, we also utilize a decoupled
knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LRQ obtains
better performance than other competitors.

called CFLOBDDs (for Context-Free-Language Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams).
They are essentially a plug-compatible alternative to BDDs (Binary Decision
Diagrams), and hence useful for representing certain classes of functions,
matrices, graphs, relations, etc. in a highly compressed fashion. CFLOBDDs
share many of the good properties of BDDs, but--in the best case--the CFLOBDD
for a Boolean function can be exponentially smaller than any BDD for that
function. Compared with the size of the decision tree for a function, a
CFLOBDD--again, in the best case--can give a double-exponential reduction in
size. They have the potential to permit applications to (i) execute much
faster, and (ii) handle much larger problem instances than has been possible
heretofore.
  CFLOBDDs are a new kind of decision diagram that go beyond BDDs (and their
many relatives). The key insight is a new way to reuse sub-decision-diagrams:
components of CFLOBDDs are structured hierarchically, so that
sub-decision-diagrams can be treated as standalone ''procedures'' and reused.
  We applied CFLOBDDs to the problem of simulating quantum circuits, and found
that for several standard problems the improvement in scalability--compared to
simulation using BDDs--is quite dramatic. In particular, the number of qubits
that could be handled using CFLOBDDs was larger, compared to BDDs, by a factor
of 128x for GHZ; 1,024x for BV; 8,192x for DJ; and 128x for Grover's algorithm.
(With a 15-minute timeout, the number of qubits that CFLOBDDs can handle are
65,536 for GHZ, 524,288 for BV; 4,194,304 for DJ; and 4,096 for Grover's

completion by transforming a partial shape encoding into a complete one using a
latent transport module, and it is designed as a latent-space energy-based

setting manner. This can be solved by using cross-attention with the scaled
dot-product mechanism. However, the magnitude differences between two separate
sets of embedding vectors may cause a significant impact on the output
attention map and affect model performance. We tackle this problem by improving
the attention mechanism with cosine similarity. Specifically, we develop FS-CT

quantum processors. For the current superconducting quantum processor,
high-fidelity control of qubits is mainly based on independently calibrated
microwave pulses, which could differ from each other in frequencies,
amplitudes, and phases. With this control strategy, the needed physical source
could be challenging, especially when scaling up to large-scale quantum
processors is considered. Inspired by Kane's proposal for spin-based quantum
computing, here, we explore theoretically the possibility of baseband flux
control of superconducting qubits with only shared and always-on microwave
drives. In our strategy, qubits are by default far detuned from the drive
during system idle periods, qubit readout and baseband flux-controlled
two-qubit gates can thus be realized with minimal impacts from the always-on
drive. By contrast, during working periods, qubits are tuned on resonance with
the drive and single-qubit gates can be realized. Therefore, universal qubit
control can be achieved with only baseband flux pulses and always-on shared
microwave drives. We apply this strategy to the qubit architecture where
tunable qubits are coupled via a tunable coupler, and the analysis shows that
high-fidelity qubit control is possible. Besides, the baseband control strategy
needs fewer physical resources, such as control electronics and cooling power
in cryogenic systems, than that of microwave control. More importantly, the
flexibility of baseband flux control could be employed for addressing the
non-uniformity issue of superconducting qubits, potentially allowing the
realization of multiplexing and cross-bar technologies and thus controlling
large numbers of qubits with fewer control lines. We thus expect that baseband
control with shared microwave drives can help build large-scale superconducting
quantum processors.

out-of-dynamics imitation learning (OOD-IL), which relaxes the assumption to
that the demonstrator and the imitator have the same state spaces but could
have different action spaces and dynamics. OOD-IL enables imitation learning to
utilize demonstrations from a wide range of demonstrators but introduces a new
challenge: some demonstrations cannot be achieved by the imitator due to the
different dynamics. Prior works try to filter out such demonstrations by
feasibility measurements, but ignore the fact that the demonstrations exhibit a
multimodal distribution since the different demonstrators may take different

adversarial-learning based algorithm in each cluster. Experiment results on
several MuJoCo environments, a driving environment, and a simulated robot

PT's training efficiency, we first make some novel observations about the
prompt transferability of ""partial PLMs"", which are defined by compressing a
PLM in depth or width. We observe that the soft prompts learned by different
partial PLMs of various sizes are similar in the parameter space, implying that
these soft prompts could potentially be transferred among partial PLMs.
Inspired by these observations, we propose Fast Prompt Tuning (FPT), which
starts by conducting PT using a small-scale partial PLM, and then progressively
expands its depth and width until the full-model size. After each expansion, we
recycle the previously learned soft prompts as initialization for the enlarged
partial PLM and then proceed PT. We demonstrate the feasibility of FPT on 5
tasks and show that FPT could save over 30% training computations while

success, in this paper, we find that its core learning strategy -- feature
alignment -- could heavily hinder the model generalization. Inspired by the
recent progress in neuron interpretability, we characterize this problem from a
neuron activation view. Specifically, by treating feature elements as neuron
activation states, we show that conventional alignment methods tend to
deteriorate the diversity of learned invariant features, as they
indiscriminately minimize all neuron activation differences. This instead
ignores rich relations among neurons -- many of them often identify the same
visual concepts though they emerge differently. With this finding, we present a
simple yet effective approach, \textit{Concept Contrast} (CoCo), which relaxes
element-wise feature alignments by contrasting high-level concepts encoded in

contrastive method in DG. Through extensive experiments, we further demonstrate
that our CoCo promotes the diversity of feature representations, and
consistently improves model generalization capability over the DomainBed

equations may be regularly constructed by a deformation algorithm. The
algorithm can be applied to Lax pairs and higher order flows. In other words,
if the original lower dimensional model is Lax integrable (possesses Lax pairs)
and symmetry integrable (possesses infinitely many higher order symmetries),
then the deformed higher order systems are also Lax integrable and symmetry
integrable. For concreteness, the deformation algorithm is applied to the usual
(1+1)-dimensional KdV equation and the (1+1)-dimensional AKNS system (including
nonlinear NLS equation as a special example). It is interesting that the
deformed (3+1)-dimensional KdV equation is also an extension of the
(1+1)-dimensional Harry-Dym (HD) type equations which are reciprocal links of
the (1+1)-dimensional KdV equation. The Lax pairs of the (3+1)-dimensional
KdV-HD system and the (2+1)-dimensional AKNS system are explicitly given. The
higher order symmetries, i.e., the whole (3+1)-dimensional KdV-HD hierarchy,
are also explicitly obtained via the deformation algorithm. The single soliton
solution of the (3+1)-dimensional KdV-HD equation is implicitly given. Because
of the effects of the deformation, the symmetric soliton shape of the usual KdV
equation is no longer conserved and deformed to be asymmetric and/or
multi-valued. The deformation conjecture is correct for almost all the known
(1+1)-dimensional integrable local evolution systems and we have not yet found
any counter-example so far. The introduction of a large number of
(D+1)-dimensional integrable systems of this paper explores a serious challenge
to all mathematicians and theoretical physicists because the traditional

$P$ be a parabolic subgroup of an irreducible simple algebraic group $G$, $P'$
its derived group and $\mathfrak m$ be the nilradical to its Lie algebra. A
theorem of Richardson implies that the subalgebra $\mathbb C[\mathfrak
m]^{P'}$, spanned by the $P$ semi-invariants in $\mathbb C[\mathfrak m]$, is
polynomial. A linear subvariety $e+V$ of $\mathfrak m$ is is called a
Weierstrass section for the action of $P'$ on $\mathfrak m$, if the restriction
map induces an isomorphism of $\mathbb C[\mathfrak m]^{P'}$ onto $\mathbb
C[e+V]$. Thus a Weierstrass section can exist only if the latter is polynomial,
but even when this holds its existence is far from assured. The existence of a
Weierstrass section $e+V$ in $\mathfrak m$ was established by a general
combinatorial construction. Notably $e \in \mathscr N$ and is a sum of root
vectors with linearly independent roots. The Weierstraass section $e+V$ looks
very different for different choices of parabolics but nevertheless has a
uniform construction and exists in all cases. It is called the ""canonical

  It was announced in [Fittouhi and Joseph, loc. cit.] that one may augment $e$
to an element $e_{VS}$ by adjoining root vectors. Then the linear span $E_{VS}$
of these root vectors lies in $\mathscr N^e$ and its closure is just $\mathscr
N^e$. Yet this result shows that $\mathscr N^e$ need not admit a dense $P$
orbit. However this theorem was only verified in the special case needed to
obtain the example showing that $\mathscr N^e$ may fail to admit a dense $P$
orbit. Here a general proof is given. Finally a map from compositions to the
set of distinct non-negative integers is defined. Its image is shown to
determine the canonical Weierstrass section.

design problem, and the hidden-action principal-agent problem of contract

private Bayesian type to take a costly action. The goal is to design an
incentive compatible menu of contracts which maximizes the expected revenue.
  Our main result concerns linear contracts, the most commonly-used contract
form in practice. We establish that in Bayesian settings, under natural
small-tail conditions, linear contracts provide an $O(1)$-approximation to the
optimal, possibly randomized menu of contracts. This constant approximation
result can also be established via a smoothed-analysis style argument. We thus
obtain a strong worst-case approximation justification of linear contracts.
  These positive findings stand out against two sets of results, which
highlight the challenges of obtaining (near-)optimal contracts with private
types. First, we show that the combination of private type and hidden action
makes the incentive compatibility constraints less tractable: the agent's
utility has to be convex (as without hidden action), but it also has to satisfy
additional curvature constraints. Second, we show that the optimal menu of
contracts can be complex and/or exhibit undesirable properties - such as
non-monotonicity of the revenue in the type distribution.

one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (1D-NLSE) of the focusing type
using a new approach called the ""growing of turbulence"". In this approach, we
add a small linear pumping term to the equation and start evolution from
statistically homogeneous Gaussian noise. After reaching a certain level of
average intensity, we switch off the pumping and examine the resulting
integrable turbulence. For sufficiently small initial noise and pumping
coefficient, and also for not very wide simulation box (basin length), we
observe that the turbulence grows in a universal adiabatic regime, moving
successively through the statistically stationary states of the integrable
1D-NLSE, which do not depend on the pumping coefficient, amplitude of the
initial noise or basing length. Waiting longer in the growth stage, we transit
from weakly nonlinear states to strongly nonlinear ones, characterized by a
high frequency of rogue waves. Using the inverse scattering transform (IST)
method to monitor the evolution, we observe that the solitonic part of the
wavefield becomes dominant even when the (linear) dispersion effects are still
leading in the dynamics and with increasing average intensity the wavefield
approaches a dense bound-state soliton gas, whose properties are defined by the
Fourier spectrum of initial noise. Regimes deviating from the universal
adiabatic growth also lead to solitonic states, but solitons in these states
have noticeably different velocities and a significantly wider distribution by
amplitude, while the statistics of wavefield indicates a much more frequent
appearance of very large waves.

motivate cooperation among them, this paper proposes a cooperative mechanism
where idle ESs can earn extra profits by sharing their spare computational

it into two stages involving the allocation and execution of offloaded tasks.
The first stage is solved by extending the well-known Deep Deterministic Policy

need to decide the processing order of tasks and the utilized computational

Nevertheless, we observe serious calibration errors outputted by ONE2SET,
especially in the over-estimation of $\varnothing$ token (means ""no

identify two main reasons behind: 1) the parallel generation has to introduce
excessive $\varnothing$ as padding tokens into training instances; and 2) the
training mechanism assigning target to each slot is unstable and further
aggravates the $\varnothing$ token over-estimation. To make the model
well-calibrated, we propose WR-ONE2SET which extends ONE2SET with an adaptive

The former dynamically penalizes the over-estimated slots for different
instances thus smoothing the uneven training distribution. The latter refines
the original inappropriate assignment and reduces the supervisory signals of
over-estimated slots. Experimental results on commonly-used datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed paradigm.

study of the combined low temperature nuclear and magnetic structure
established in this material. Details on the connection between Li-ion dynamics
and structural changes are also presented along with a direct link between
atomic structure and spin order via a strong magnetoelastic coupling.
LiCrSe$_2$ was found to undergo a first order structural transition from a
trigonal crystal system with space group $P\bar{3}m1$ to a monoclinic one with
space group $C2/m$ at $T_{\rm s}=30$~K. Such restructuring of the lattice is
accompanied by a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}=30$~K, with the formation of
a complex spin arrangement for the Cr$^{3+}$ moments. Refinement of the
magnetic structure with neutron diffraction data and complementary muon spin
rotation analysis reveal the presence of two incommensurate magnetic domains
with a up-up-down-down arrangement of the spins with ferromagnetic (FM) double
chains coupled antiferromagnetically (AFM). In addition to this unusual
arrangement, the spin axial vector is modulated both in direction and modulus,
resulting in a spin density wave-like order with periodic suppression of the Cr
moment along the chains. This behavior is believed to appear as a result of
strong competition between direct exchange AFM and superexchange FM couplings
established between both nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor Cr$^{3+}$
ions. We finally conjecture that the resulting magnetic order is stabilized via
subtle vacancy/charge order within the Li layers, potentially causing a mix of
two different magnetic phases within the sample.

classification tasks to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon that
earlier learned knowledge is forgotten when learning new concepts. For class
incremental semantic segmentation, such a phenomenon often becomes much worse
due to the background shift, i.e., some concepts learned at previous stages are
assigned to the background class at the current training stage, therefore,
significantly reducing the performance of these old concepts. To address this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective method in this paper, named Mining
unseen Classes via Regional Objectness for Segmentation (MicroSeg). Our
MicroSeg is based on the assumption that background regions with strong
objectness possibly belong to those concepts in the historical or future
stages. Therefore, to avoid forgetting old knowledge at the current training
stage, our MicroSeg first splits the given image into hundreds of segment
proposals with a proposal generator. Those segment proposals with strong
objectness from the background are then clustered and assigned newly-defined
labels during the optimization. In this way, the distribution characterizes of
old concepts in the feature space could be better perceived, relieving the
catastrophic forgetting caused by the background shift accordingly. Extensive
experiments on Pascal VOC and ADE20K datasets show competitive results with
state-of-the-art, well validating the effectiveness of the proposed MicroSeg.

$^1$S$_0$-to-$^3$P$_0$ transition strength, the steady-state power in that
system is relatively low ($\sim 10^{-12}$W). In this work, we propose an
alternative superradiant laser scheme based on a Raman-transition-induced
coupling between the $^3$P$_0$ and $^3$P$_1$ states in bosonic
alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, and achieve a laser with linewidth $\lesssim
2\pi\times1$Hz and power $\gtrsim 10^{-10}$W ($\sim 10^{3}$ photons in steady
state) at a small pumping cost. The Raman beams play two significant roles in
our scheme. First, the coherence between the dark and bright states induced by
the Raman beams produce a new local minimum in the pumping-linewidth curve with
pumping rate lower than $2\pi \times 10$kHz, which is beneficial for continuous
output. Second, the Raman beams mix the long-lived $^3$P$_0$ state into the
lasing state and thus reduce the linewidth. Our work greatly improves the

engagement measurement using the traditional frameworks of binary
classification (classifying video snippets into engaged or disengaged classes),
multi-class classification (classifying video snippets into multiple classes
corresponding to different levels of engagement), or regression (estimating a
continuous value corresponding to the level of engagement). However, we observe
that while the engagement behaviour is mostly well-defined (e.g., focused, not
distracted), disengagement can be expressed in various ways. In addition, in
some cases, the data for disengaged classes may not be sufficient to train
generalizable binary or multi-class classifiers. To handle this situation, in
this paper, for the first time, we formulate detecting disengagement in virtual
learning as an anomaly detection problem. We design various autoencoders,

invariant gravity, and the entropy in the first law is the Wald entropy which
is highly dependent on the non-minimal coupling interactions in the theory of
gravity. However, whether the Wald entropy still satisfies the second law needs
to be investigated. The entropy of black holes obeying the linearized second
law in arbitrary high-order curvature gravity is given, which can be written as
the Wald entropy with correction terms. It indicates that the Wald entropy is
not commonly obeying the linearized second law for any high-order curvature
gravity. When the interactions of gravity with matter fields are included in
the theory of gravity, the entropy of black holes obeying the linearized second
law has not been obtained in this case. Considering any high-order curvature
gravity with the scalar and the electromagnetic fields, from the Raychaudhuri
equation, the entropy obeying the linearized second law is generally obtained,
which can be expressed as the Wald entropy with correction terms as well. The
entropy does not include the contribution from the electromagnetic fields, and
the correction terms contain the contribution from the minimal coupling
interaction between gravity and the scalar fields. Since the entropy satisfying
the linearized second law depends only on the non-minimal coupling interaction
of gravity in previous research, this result upends our understanding of the
entropy of black holes obeying the linearized second law in any gravitational

We demonstrate that sleep has a positive effect on energy consumption and
cognitive performance during the post-sleep awake classification task of

methods achieve good performance. However, in the data subproblem, the used
sensing matrix is ill-suited for the real degradation process due to the device
errors caused by phase aberration, distortion; in the prior subproblem, it is
important to design a suitable model to jointly exploit both spatial and

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2011.10217",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Medical image benchmarks for the segmentation of organs and tumors suffer
from the partially labeling issue due to its intensive cost of labor and
expertise. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network
solving one task. With this pipeline, not only the performance is limited by
the typically small dataset of a single task, but also the computation cost
linearly increases with the number of tasks. To address this, we propose a
Transformer based dynamic on-demand network (TransDoDNet) that learns to
segment organs and tumors on multiple partially labeled datasets. Specifically,
TransDoDNet has a hybrid backbone that is composed of the convolutional neural
network and Transformer. A dynamic head enables the network to accomplish
multiple segmentation tasks flexibly. Unlike existing approaches that fix
kernels after training, the kernels in the dynamic head are generated
adaptively by the Transformer, which employs the self-attention mechanism to
model long-range organ-wise dependencies and decodes the organ embedding that
can represent each organ. We create a large-scale partially labeled Multi-Organ
and Tumor Segmentation benchmark, termed MOTS, and demonstrate the superior
performance of our TransDoDNet over other competitors on seven organ and tumor
segmentation tasks. This study also provides a general 3D medical image
segmentation model, which has been pre-trained on the large-scale MOTS
benchmark and has demonstrated advanced performance over BYOL, the current
predominant self-supervised learning method. Code will be available at

produced via multiple explosion channels. Understanding how different channels
evolve with redshift is critical in determining their precision in measuring
cosmological parameters. Previous studies indicated that SN Ia ejecta velocity
is one powerful tool to differentiate between different channels. It was also
suspected that the tight correlation with the host-galaxy environment could
result in the evolution of SN ejecta velocities. In this work, we measure the
Si II 6355 velocities from ~400 confirmed SNe Ia discovered by the Pan-STARRS1
Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS), and combine them with the SNe discovered by
different surveys to form a large compilation of velocity measurements. For the
first time, we find that the SNe Ia with faster Si II 6355 have a significantly
different redshift distribution from their slower counterparts (with a p-value
of 0.00008 from the K-S test), in the sense that HV SNe Ia are more likely to
be found at lower redshift. The trend may suggest a strong evolution of SN Ia
ejecta velocity, or imply that the SN Ia demographics (as distinguished by
their ejecta velocities) are likely to vary with time. Our results also imply
that the progenitor system of HV SNe Ia (and possibly some NV SNe Ia) may favor
a metal-rich environment and/or scenarios of long delay time. However, we do
not see a significant difference (in ~2 sigma) in Hubble residuals when
splitting our sample based on the Si II 6355 velocity.

excavations, carry rich information about past human societies so need to be
accurately reconstructed and recorded digitally for analysis and preservation.
Often hundreds of fragments are uncovered in a day at an archaeological
excavation site, far beyond the scanning capacity of existing imaging systems.
Hence, there is high demand for a desirable image acquisition system capable of
imaging hundreds of fragments per day. In response to this demand, we developed
a new system, dubbed FIRES, for Fast Imaging and 3D REconstruction of Sherds.
The FIRES system consists of two main components. The first is an optimally
designed fast image acquisition device capable of capturing over 700 sherds per
day (in 8 working hours) in actual tests at an excavation site, which is one
order-of-magnitude faster than existing systems. The second component is an
automatic pipeline for 3D reconstruction of the sherds from the images captured
by the imaging acquisition system, achieving reconstruction accuracy of 0.16
milimeters. The pipeline includes a novel batch matching algorithm that matches
partial 3D scans of the front and back sides of the sherds and a new ICP-type
method that registers the front and back sides sharing very narrow overlapping
regions. Extensive validation in labs and testing in excavation sites
demonstrated that our FIRES system provides the first fast, accurate, portal,
and cost-effective solution for the task of imaging and 3D reconstruction of
sherds in archaeological excavations.

been studied in plasmas under magnetic fields, superfluid ${\rm He}^3$, quantum

Although this is expected in equilibrium systems, it is not obvious that
Onsager relations hold in active materials. By directly coarse graining the
kinetic energy and using both the Poisson-bracket formalism and a kinetic

momentum density necessarily breaks Onsager reciprocal relations, which leads
to a non-Hermitian dynamical matrix for the total momentum and to the
appearance of odd viscosity and other non-dissipative contributions to the
viscosity. Furthermore, by accounting for both the angular momentum density and
interactions that lead to odd viscosity, we find regions in the parameter space
in which 3D odd mechanical waves propagate and and regions in which they are
mechanically unstable. The lines separating these regions are continuous lines
of exceptional points, suggesting of a non-reciprocal phase transition.

planning and control of robust cooperative locomotion by two holonomically
constrained quadrupedal robots. A novel interconnected network of reduced-order
models, based on the single rigid body (SRB) dynamics, is developed for
trajectory planning purposes. At the higher level of the control architecture,
two different model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are proposed to address
the optimal control problem of the interconnected SRB dynamics: centralized and
distributed MPCs. The distributed MPC assumes two local quadratic programs that
share their optimal solutions according to a one-step communication delay and
an agreement protocol. At the lower level of the control scheme, distributed
nonlinear controllers are developed to impose the full-order dynamics to track
the prescribed reduced-order trajectories generated by MPCs. The effectiveness
of the control approach is verified with extensive numerical simulations and
experiments for the robust and cooperative locomotion of two holonomically
constrained A1 robots with different payloads on variable terrains and in the
presence of disturbances. It is shown that the distributed MPC has a
performance similar to that of the centralized MPC, while the computation time
is reduced significantly.

Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations of the GAMA23 field. About 112 radio sources
are currently known beyond redshift $z\sim4$. However, simulations predict that
hundreds of thousands of radio sources exist in that redshift range, many of
which are probably in existing radio catalogues but do not have measured
redshifts, either because their optical emission is too faint or because of the
lack of techniques that can identify candidate high-redshift radio sources
(HzRSs). Our study addresses these issues using the Lyman Dropout search
technique. This newly built sample probes radio luminosities that are 1-2
orders of magnitude fainter than known radio-active galactic nuclei (AGN) at
similar redshifts, thanks to ASKAP's sensitivity. We investigate the physical
origin of radio emission in our sample using a set of diagnostics: (i) radio
luminosity at 1.4 GHz, (ii) 1.4 GHz-to-3.4 $\mu$m flux density ratio, (iii)
Far-IR detection, (iv) WISE colour, and (v) SED modelling. The radio/IR
analysis has shown that the majority of radio emission in the faint and bright
end of our sample's 887.5 MHz flux density distribution originates from AGN
activity. Furthermore, $\sim10\%$ of our sample are found to have a 250 $\mu$m
detection, suggesting a composite system. This suggests that some high-$z$
radio-AGNs are hosted by SB galaxies, in contrast to low-$z$ radio-AGNs, which
are usually hosted by quiescent elliptical galaxies.

allowing us to compute the meagre codimension of the set of Riemannian metrics

textual descriptions) typically show better recommendation accuracy than
general recommendation models based solely on user-item interactions.
Generally, prior work fuses multimodal features into item ID embeddings to
enrich item representations, thus failing to capture the latent semantic
item-item structures. In this context, LATTICE [1] proposes to learn the latent
structure between items explicitly and achieves state-of-the-art performance
for multimodal recommendations. However, we argue the latent graph structure
learning of LATTICE is both inefficient and unnecessary. Experimentally, we
demonstrate that freezing its item-item structure before training can also
achieve competitive performance. Based on this finding, we propose a simple yet
effective model, dubbed as FREEDOM, that FREEzes the item-item graph and
DenOises the user-item interaction graph simultaneously for Multimodal
recommendation. In denoising the user-item interaction graph, we devise a
degree-sensitive edge pruning method, which rejects possibly noisy edges with a
high probability when sampling the graph. We evaluate the proposed model on
three real-world datasets and show that FREEDOM can significantly outperform
the strongest baselines. Compared with LATTICE, FREEDOM achieves an average
improvement of 19.07% in recommendation accuracy while reducing its memory cost
up to 6$\times$ on large graphs. The source code is available at:

chronic illnesses in the world and the third leading cause of mortality
worldwide. It is often underdiagnosed or not diagnosed until later in the
disease course. Spirometry tests are the gold standard for diagnosing COPD but
can be difficult to obtain, especially in resource-poor countries. Chest X-rays
(CXRs), however, are readily available and may serve as a screening tool to
identify patients with COPD who should undergo further testing. Currently, no
research applies deep learning (DL) algorithms that use large multi-site and
multi-modal data to detect COPD patients and evaluate fairness across
demographic groups. We use three CXR datasets in our study, CheXpert to
pre-train models, MIMIC-CXR to develop, and Emory-CXR to validate our models.
The CXRs from patients in the early stage of COPD and not on mechanical
ventilation are selected for model training and validation. We visualize the
Grad-CAM heatmaps of the true positive cases on the base model for both
MIMIC-CXR and Emory-CXR test datasets. We further propose two fusion schemes,
(1) model-level fusion, including bagging and stacking methods using MIMIC-CXR,
and (2) data-level fusion, including multi-site data using MIMIC-CXR and
Emory-CXR, and multi-modal using MIMIC-CXRs and MIMIC-IV EHR, to improve the
overall model performance. Fairness analysis is performed to evaluate if the
fusion schemes have a discrepancy in the performance among different
demographic groups. The results demonstrate that DL models can detect COPD
using CXRs, which can facilitate early screening, especially in low-resource
regions where CXRs are more accessible than spirometry. The multi-site data
fusion scheme could improve the model generalizability on the Emory-CXR test

besides the BMS symmetry there exists an anisotropic scaling symmetry in BMS
free fermion theory. As a result, the symmetry of the theory gets enhanced to
an infinite dimensional symmetry generated by a BMS-Kac-Moody algebra, similar
to the one in the BMS free scalar model. Different from the BMS free scalar
case, the Kac-Moody level in the algebra is nonvanishing now such that the
corresponding modules are further enlarged to BMS-Kac-Moody staggered modules.
We show that there exists an underlying $W(2,2,1)$ structure in the operator
product expansion of the currents, and the BMS-Kac-Moody staggered modules can
be viewed as highest-weight modules of this $W$-algebra. Moreover we obtain the
BMS Ising model by a fermion-boson duality. This BMS Ising model is not a
minimal model with respect to BMS$_3$, since the minimal model construction
based on BMS Kac determinant always leads to chiral Virasoro minimal models.
Instead, the underlying algebra of the BMS Ising model is the
$W(2,2,1)$-algebra, which can be understood as a quantum conformal BMS$_3$
algebra.

train agents in the presence of an adversary. An adversary acts to destabilise
the agent, which learns a more robust policy and can better handle realistic

use of goal-conditioning: this is particularly useful in the context of

four observing sites. This is the fourth centaur for which a multichord (more
than two chords) stellar occultation has been observed so far, the other three
being (2060) Chiron, (10199) Chariklo, and (95626) 2002 GZ$_{32}$. From the
analysis of the occultation chords, combined with the rotational light curve
obtained shortly after the occultation, we determined that Bienor has an
area-equivalent diameter of $150\pm20$ km. This diameter is $\sim30$ km smaller
than the one obtained from thermal measurements. The position angle of the
short axis of the best fitting ellipse obtained through the analysis of the
stellar occultation does not match that of the spin axis derived from long-term

optimization algorithms. These algorithms exhibit different execution patterns,
and their execution needs massive computational resources that go beyond a
single CPU and GPU. Existing differentiable optimization libraries, however,
cannot support efficient algorithm development and multi-CPU/GPU execution,
making the development of differentiable optimization algorithms often
cumbersome and expensive. This paper introduces TorchOpt, a PyTorch-based
efficient library for differentiable optimization. TorchOpt provides a unified
and expressive differentiable optimization programming abstraction. This
abstraction allows users to efficiently declare and analyze various
differentiable optimization programs with explicit gradients, implicit
gradients, and zero-order gradients. TorchOpt further provides a
high-performance distributed execution runtime. This runtime can fully
parallelize computation-intensive differentiation operations (e.g. tensor tree
flattening) on CPUs / GPUs and automatically distribute computation to
distributed devices. Experimental results show that TorchOpt achieves
$5.2\times$ training time speedup on an 8-GPU server. TorchOpt is available at:

be potentially used to make data-driven operational decisions. In the basic
form, the decision model needs to monitor a large set of machine data, such as
CPU utilization, allocated memory, disk and network latency, and predicts the
system metrics to prevent performance degradation. Nevertheless, building an
effective prediction model in this scenario is rather challenging as the model
has to accurately capture the long-range coupling dependency in the
Multivariate Time-Series (MTS). Moreover, this model needs to have low
computational complexity and can scale efficiently to the dimension of data
available. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient model named HigeNet to
predict the long-time sequence time series. We have deployed the HigeNet on
production in the D-matrix platform. We also provide offline evaluations on
several publicly available datasets as well as one online dataset to

better than five state-of-the-art competing models.

  Consequently, it becomes crucial to take precautionary measures to

applied in computational biology, speech recognition, and machine learning. Let
$e_k(n)$ denote the average edit distance between random, independent strings
of $n$ characters from an alphabet of size $k$. For $k \geq 2$, it is an open
problem how to efficiently compute the exact value of $\alpha_{k}(n) =
e_k(n)/n$ as well as of $\alpha_{k} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \alpha_{k}(n)$, a
limit known to exist.
  This paper shows that $\alpha_k(n)-Q(n) \leq \alpha_k \leq \alpha_k(n)$, for
a specific $Q(n)=\Theta(\sqrt{\log n / n})$, a result which implies that
$\alpha_k$ is computable. The exact computation of $\alpha_k(n)$ is explored,
leading to an algorithm running in time $T=\mathcal{O}(n^2k\min(3^n,k^n))$, a
complexity that makes it of limited practical use.
  An analysis of statistical estimates is proposed, based on McDiarmid's
inequality, showing how $\alpha_k(n)$ can be evaluated with good accuracy, high
confidence level, and reasonable computation time, for values of $n$ say up to
a quarter million. Correspondingly, 99.9\% confidence intervals of width
approximately $10^{-2}$ are obtained for $\alpha_k$.
  Combinatorial arguments on edit scripts are exploited to analytically
characterize an efficiently computable lower bound $\beta_k^*$ to $\alpha_k$,
such that $ \lim_{k \to \infty} \beta_k^*=1$. In general, $\beta_k^* \leq
\alpha_k \leq 1-1/k$; for $k$ greater than a few dozens, computing $\beta_k^*$
is much faster than generating good statistical estimates with confidence
intervals of width $1-1/k-\beta_k^*$.
  The techniques developed in the paper yield improvements on most previously
published numerical values as well as results for alphabet sizes and string
lengths not reported before.

The estimated phase differences are used for reconstructing phase by solving a

and explores the commonalities and discrepancies of technical settlements under
different segmentation circumstances. Specifically, the preliminaries on
few/zero-shot visual semantic segmentation, including the problem definitions,

Moreover, three typical instantiations are involved to uncover the interactions

achieved great success in many fields such as computer vision and natural
language processing. However, many existing vision transformer (ViT) works
simply inherent transformer designs from NLP to adapt vision tasks, while
ignoring the fundamental difference between ``how MSA works in image and
language settings''. Language naturally contains highly semantic structures
that are directly interpretable by humans. Its basic unit (word) is discrete
without redundant information, which readily supports interpretable studies on
MSA mechanisms of language transformer. In contrast, visual data exhibits a
fundamentally different structure: Its basic unit (pixel) is a natural
low-level representation with significant redundancies in the neighbourhood,
which poses obvious challenges to the interpretability of MSA mechanism in ViT.
In this paper, we introduce a typical image processing technique, i.e.,
scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFTs), which maps low-level
representations into mid-level spaces, and annotates extensive discrete
keypoints with semantically rich information. Next, we construct a weighted
patch interrelation analysis based on SIFT keypoints to capture the attention
patterns hidden in patches with different semantic concentrations
Interestingly, we find this quantitative analysis is not only an effective
complement to the interpretability of MSA mechanisms in ViT, but can also be
applied to 1) spurious correlation discovery and ``prompting'' during model
inference, 2) and guided model pre-training acceleration. Experimental results
on both applications show significant advantages over baselines, demonstrating

consensus mechanism for blockchains. Each network node of a blockchain could
use a true random number generator (TRNG) and hash algorism to fulfil the PoR
protocol. In this whitepaper, we give the consensus mechanism of the PoR
protocol, and show how it could make the random numbers unforgeable. The PoR
protocol could generate a blockchain without any competition of computing power
or stake of cryptocurrency. Besides, we give some advantages of integrating
quantum random number generator (QRNG) chips in hardware wallets, and also
discuss the route to cooperate with quantum key distribution (QKD) technology.

and doctors can make judgments on the physical condition of patients through
medical data. However, the interpretation of medical data requires a lot of
labor costs and may be misjudged, so many scholars use neural networks and deep
learning to classify and study medical data, thereby improving doctors' work
efficiency and accuracy, achieving early detection of diseases and early
diagnosis, so it has a wide range of application prospects. However,
traditional neural networks have disadvantages such as high energy consumption
and high latency (slow calculation speed). This paper introduces the research
on signal classification and disease diagnosis based on the third-generation
neural network - pulse neural network in recent years, using medical data, such
as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyography (EMG),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc., summarizes the advantages and
disadvantages of pulse neural networks compared with traditional networks, and
looks forward to the future development direction.

  (2023)","10.1142/S021988782350192X",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present research paper is an investigation of dark energy nature of
logarithmic $f(R, T)$-gravity cosmology in a flat FLRW space-time universe. We
have derived modified Einstein's field equations for the function $f(R,
T)=R-16\pi G\alpha\ln(T)$ where $R$ is the Ricci scalar curvature, $T$ is the
trace of the stress energy momentum tensor and $\alpha$ is a model parameter.
We have solved field equations in the form of two fluid scenario as
perfect-fluid and dark-fluid, where dark fluid term is derived in the form of
perfect fluid source. We have made an observational constraints on the
cosmological parameters $\Omega_{(m)}, \omega^{(de)}$ and $H_{0}$ using
$\chi^{2}$ test with observational datasets like Pantheon sample of SNe Ia and
$H(z)$. With these constraints we have discussed our model with deceleration
parameter $q$, energy parameters $\Omega_{(m)}, \Omega_{(de)}$, EoS parameter
$\omega^{(de)}$ etc. Also, we have done Om diagnostic analysis. The derived
$f(R, T)$ model shows a quintessence dark energy model $\omega^{(de)}>-1$ and
late-time universe approaches to $\Lambda$CDM model.

  Timeseries Analysis",,,,,"q-fin.GN cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Environmental, social and governance (ESG) engagement of companies moved into
the focus of public attention over recent years. With the requirements of
compulsory reporting being implemented and investors incorporating
sustainability in their investment decisions, the demand for transparent and
reliable ESG ratings is increasing. However, automatic approaches for
forecasting ESG ratings have been quite scarce despite the increasing
importance of the topic. In this paper, we build a model to predict ESG ratings
from news articles using the combination of multivariate timeseries
construction and deep learning techniques. A news dataset for about 3,000 US
companies together with their ratings is also created and released for
training. Through the experimental evaluation we find out that our approach
provides accurate results outperforming the state-of-the-art, and can be used
in practice to support a manual determination or analysis of ESG ratings.
