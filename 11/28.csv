receivers arises from nearby device interference. The paper presents a 2-6 GHz
GaN LNA front-end with onboard sensing, processing, and feedback utilizing
microcontroller-based controls to achieve adaptation to a variety of
interference scenarios through power and linearity regulations. The utilization
of GaN LNA provides high power handling capability (30 dBm) and high linearity
(OIP3= 30 dBm) for radar and EW applications. The system permits an LNA power
consumption to tune from 500 mW to 2 W (4X increase) in order to adjust the
linearity from P\textsubscript{1dB,IN}=-10.5 dBm to 0.5 dBm (>10X increase).
Across the tuning range, the noise figure increases by approximately 0.4 dB.
Feedback control methods are presented with backgrounds from control theory.
The rest of the controls consume $\leq$10$\%$ (100 mW) of nominal LNA power (1
W) to achieve an adaptation time <1 ms.

only upload encrypted training models, and then aggregates the model parameters
to build a shared server model to protect data privacy. To motivate workers to
build a high-quality global model in an efficacy way, we introduce an incentive
mechanism that encourages workers to constantly collect fresh data to train
accurate client models and boosts the global model training. We model the
incentive-based interaction between the crowdsourcing platform and
participating workers as a Stackelberg game, in which each side maximizes its
own profit. We derive the Nash Equilibrium of the game to find the optimal
solutions for the two sides. Experimental results confirm that iFedCrowd can

activities, which is far longer than the 15-minute (walking) city advocated by
ecologically-oriented urban planners. This paper provides a comprehensive
analysis of local trip behavior in US cities using GPS data on individual trips
from 40 million mobile devices. We define local usage as the share of trips

city resident makes only 12% of their daily trips within such a short distance.
We find that differences in access to local services can explain eighty percent
of the variation in 15-minute usage across metropolitan areas and 74 percent of
the variation in usage within metropolitan areas. Differences in historic
zoning permissiveness within New York suggest a causal link between access and
usage, and that less restrictive zoning rules, such as permitting more
mixed-use development, would lead to shorter travel times. Finally, we document
a strong correlation between local usage and experienced segregation for

minimize the cost of opening the chosen facilities and the total cost of
connecting all the clients to their nearby open facilities. Such an objective
may induce an unequal cost over certain socioeconomic groups of clients (i.e.,
total distance traveled by clients in such a group). This is important when
planning the location of socially relevant facilities such as emergency rooms.
In this work, we consider a \emph{fair} version of the problem by minimizing
the Minkowski $p$-norm of the total distance traveled by clients across
different socioeconomic groups and the cost of opening facilities, to penalize
high access costs to open facilities across $r$ groups of clients. This
generalizes classic facility location ($p =1$) and the minimization of the
maximum total distance traveled by clients in any group ($p = \infty$).
However, it is often unclear how to select a specific ""$p$"" to model the cost
of unfairness. To get around this, we show the existence of a small portfolio
of solutions where for any Minkowski $p$-norm, at least one of the solutions is
a constant-factor approximation with respect to any $p$-norm. Moreover, we give
efficient algorithms to find such a portfolio of solutions. We also introduce
the notion of refinement across the solutions in the portfolio. This property
ensures that once a facility is closed in one of the solutions, all clients
assigned to it are reassigned to a single facility and not split across open
facilities. We give $\text{poly}(r^{1/\sqrt{\log r}})$-approximation for
refinement in general metrics and $O(\log r)$-approximation for the line
metric, where $r$ is the number of (disjoint) client groups. The techniques
introduced in the work are quite general, and we show an additional application
to a hierarchical facility location problem.

simultaneous combination of virtual and real world data coming from vehicle
dynamics and traffic scenarios. The model and testing environment are evolved
from model, hardware to vehicle in the loop and proving ground testing stages,
similar to standard development cycle in automotive industry. In particular, we
also integrate other transfer learning techniques such as domain randomization
and adaptation in each stage. The simulation and real data are gradually

The proposed RL methodology is applied to develop a path following steering

where a system is required to return relevant information resources to user's

evolved with the ever-lasting technical innovation. To design effective
retrieval models, a key point lies in how to learn the text representation and
model the relevance matching. The recent success of pretrained language models

leveraging the excellent modeling capacity of PLMs. With powerful PLMs, we can
effectively learn the representations of queries and texts in the latent
representation space, and further construct the semantic matching function
between the dense vectors for relevance modeling. Such a retrieval approach is
referred to as dense retrieval, since it employs dense vectors (a.k.a.,
embeddings) to represent the texts. Considering the rapid progress on dense
retrieval, in this survey, we systematically review the recent advances on
PLM-based dense retrieval. Different from previous surveys on dense retrieval,
we take a new perspective to organize the related work by four major aspects,

mainstream techniques for each aspect. We thoroughly survey the literature, and

Additionally, we assume sufficient amount of labeled data from the source

a fundamental problem, both physically and mathematically, with applications in

evolution of a soliton as it interacts with a rarefaction wave or a dispersive
shock wave, examples of slowly varying and rapidly oscillating dispersive mean
fields, for the Korteweg-de Vries equation is studied. Step boundary conditions
give rise to either a rarefaction wave (step up) or a dispersive shock wave
(step down). When a soliton interacts with one of these mean fields, it can
either transmit through (tunnel) or become embedded (trapped) inside, depending
on its initial amplitude and position. A comprehensive review of three separate
analytical approaches is undertaken to describe these interactions. First, a
basic soliton perturbation theory is introduced that is found to capture the
solution dynamics for soliton-rarefaction wave interaction in the small
dispersion limit. Next, multiphase Whitham modulation theory and its finite-gap
description are used to describe soliton-rarefaction wave and
soliton-dispersive shock wave interactions. Lastly, a spectral description and
an exact solution of the initial value problem is obtained through the Inverse
Scattering Transform. For transmitted solitons, far-field asymptotics reveal
the soliton phase shift through either type of wave mentioned above. In the
trapped case, there is no proper eigenvalue in the spectral description,
implying that the evolution does not involve a proper soliton solution. These
approaches are consistent, agree with direct numerical simulation, and

for approximately 40% of all energy usage in the U.S., and similar numbers are
being reported from countries around the world. This significant amount of
energy is used to maintain a comfortable, secure, and productive environment
for the occupants. So, it is crucial that the energy consumption in buildings
must be optimized, all the while maintaining satisfactory levels of occupant
comfort, health, and safety. Recently, Machine Learning has been proven to be
an invaluable tool in deriving important insights from data and optimizing
various systems. In this work, we review the ways in which machine learning has
been leveraged to make buildings smart and energy-efficient. For the
convenience of readers, we provide a brief introduction of several machine
learning paradigms and the components and functioning of each smart building
system we cover. Finally, we discuss challenges faced while implementing
machine learning algorithms in smart buildings and provide future avenues for
research at the intersection of smart buildings and machine learning.

a physical speedup that yields a faster change in time in the quantum domain,
e.g., by dynamically exploiting quantum correlations. In this contribution,
speed limits for arbitrary processes of interacting systems are derived subject
to the manifold of non-entangled states. This upper-bounds the rate of change
for non-entangled states and can be compared with the speed of the entangling
propagation in time. Specifically, by overcoming such local constraints, the
entanglement-assisted speedup of a correlated quantum evolution is
demonstrated, encompassing complex forms of time-dependent multipartite
entanglement. Relevant examples from diverse physical systems for bipartite and
multipartite as well as qubit and qudit scenarios are analyzed in this manner.
Importantly, cases are found with exponentially enhanced speeds. Therefore, we

favorably with the forecasted bounds from CMB-S4: $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm

this could be ameliorated by tight simulation-based priors on the nuisance

galaxies and survey depth is increased: as expected, deep dense surveys are the
most constraining, though it will be difficult to reach $\sigma(f_{\rm

derive two distinct sets of results depending on if the matching procedure does

which is consistent in either regime. Combining these results establishes the
asymptotic exactness of tests based on these estimators. Next, we consider the
properties of two common testing procedures based on t-tests constructed from
linear regressions, and argue that both are generally conservative in our

usual kernel-MMD test statistic is a degenerate U-statistic under the null, and
thus it has an intractable limiting distribution. Hence, to design a
level-$\alpha$ test, one usually selects the rejection threshold as the
$(1-\alpha)$-quantile of the permutation distribution. The resulting
nonparametric test has finite-sample validity but suffers from large
computational cost, since every permutation takes quadratic time. We propose
the cross-MMD, a new quadratic-time MMD test statistic based on
sample-splitting and studentization. We prove that under mild assumptions, the
cross-MMD has a limiting standard Gaussian distribution under the null.
Importantly, we also show that the resulting test is consistent against any
fixed alternative, and when using the Gaussian kernel, it has minimax
rate-optimal power against local alternatives. For large sample sizes, our new
cross-MMD provides a significant speedup over the MMD, for only a slight loss
in power.

exist some positive numbers $A,T$ so that for every $n$, \[ P(n) \ge An^{-T\log
n} \lambda^n, \] where $\lambda$ is Klarner's constant, that is
$\lambda=\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{P(n)}$. This is somewhat a step toward the
well known conjecture that there exist positive $A,T$ so that $P(n)\sim
An^{-T}\lambda^n$ for every $n$.
  Beside the above theoretical result, we also conjecture that the ratio of the
number of inconstructible polyominoes over $P(n)$ is decreasing, by observing
this behavior for the available values. The conjecture opens a nice approach to
bounding $\lambda$, since if it is the case, we can conclude that \[ \lambda <
4.1141, \] which is quite close to the currently best lower bound $\lambda >
4.0025$ and largely improves the currently best upper bound $\lambda < 4.5252$.
  The approach is merely analytically manipulating the known or likely
properties of the function $P(n)$, instead of giving new insights of the
structure of polyominoes.

demonstrate an original nanospectroscopy technique that permits to study the
light-matter interaction in single subwavelength-sized nano-cavities where
far-field spectroscopy is not possible using conventional techniques. We
inserted a thin ($\approx$ 150 nm) polymer layer with negligible absorption in
the mid-IR (5 $\mu$m < $\lambda$ < 12 $\mu$m) inside a metal-insulator-metal
resonant cavity, where a photonic mode and the intersubband transition of a
semiconductor quantum well are strongly coupled. The intersubband transition
peaks at $\lambda$ = 8.3 $\mu$m, and the nano-cavity is overall 270 nm thick.
Acting as a non-perturbative transducer, the polymer layer introduces only a
limited alteration of the optical response while allowing to reveal the optical
power absorbed inside the concealed cavity. Spectroscopy of the cavity losses
is enabled by the polymer thermal expansion due to heat dissipation in the
active part of the cavity, and performed using an atomic force microscope
(AFM). This innovative approach allows the typical anticrossing characteristic
of the polaritonic dispersion to be identified in the cavity loss spectra at
the single nano-resonator level. Results also suggest that near-field coupling
of the external drive field to the top metal patch mediated by a metal-coated
AFM probe tip is possible, and it enables the near-field mapping of the cavity
mode symmetry including in the presence of strong light-matter interaction.

it matter how the labelled samples are used throughout the training process

number of unsupervised methods for selecting specific subsets of data to label
(without prior knowledge of their labels), with the goal of maximizing
representativeness w.r.t. the unlabelled set. Then, for our second line of
inquiry, we define a variety of different label injection strategies in the
training process. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets, CIFAR-10,

rough shock front and the formation of a train of weak shocks traveling at
different velocities. Additionally, the normal shock was seen to diffuse the
momentum in the transverse direction, affecting the shock rise and the
rounding-off observed at the continuum scale measurements. The numerical
simulations indicate that the reflections at the interfaces, wave scattering,

in many fields. With the increasing depth of DNNs, hundreds of millions of
multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations need to be executed. To accelerate
such operations efficiently, analog in-memory computing platforms based on
emerging devices, e.g., resistive RAM (RRAM), have been introduced. These
acceleration platforms rely on analog properties of the devices and thus suffer
from process variations and noise. Consequently, weights in neural networks
configured into these platforms can deviate from the expected values, which may
lead to feature errors and a significant degradation of inference accuracy. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework to enhance the
robustness of neural networks under variations and noise. First, a modified
Lipschitz constant regularization is proposed during neural network training to
suppress the amplification of errors propagated through network layers.
Afterwards, error compensation is introduced at necessary locations determined
by reinforcement learning to rescue the feature maps with remaining errors.
Experimental results demonstrate that inference accuracy of neural networks can
be recovered from as low as 1.69% under variations and noise back to more than
95% of their original accuracy, while the training and hardware cost are
negligible.

downsample the video, reducing the inference resolution and hampering the
detection performance in the original temporal resolution. In essence, this is
due to a temporal quantization error introduced during the resolution
downsampling and recovery. This could negatively impact the TAD performance,
but is largely ignored by existing methods. To address this problem, in this

the past decades. However, the increasing number of multiply-and-accumulate
(MAC) operations in DNNs prevents their application in resource-constrained and
resource-varying platforms, e.g., mobile phones and autonomous vehicles. In
such platforms, neural networks need to provide acceptable results quickly and
the accuracy of the results should be able to be enhanced dynamically according
to the computational resources available in the computing system. To address
these challenges, we propose a design framework called SteppingNet. SteppingNet
constructs a series of subnets whose accuracy is incrementally enhanced as more
MAC operations become available. Therefore, this design allows a trade-off
between accuracy and latency. In addition, the larger subnets in SteppingNet
are built upon smaller subnets, so that the results of the latter can directly
be reused in the former without recomputation. This property allows SteppingNet
to decide on-the-fly whether to enhance the inference accuracy by executing
further MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that SteppingNet
provides an effective incremental accuracy improvement and its inference
accuracy consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art work under the same
limit of computational resources.

Traditional visual localization frameworks approach the semantic map-matching

end-to-end visual semantic localization neural network using multi-view camera
images. Specifically, a visual BEV (Birds-Eye-View) encoder extracts and
flattens the multi-view images into BEV space. While the semantic map features
are structurally embedded as map queries sequence. Then a cross-model
transformer associates the BEV features and semantic map queries. The
localization information of ego-car is recursively queried out by
cross-attention modules. Finally, the ego pose can be inferred by decoding the
transformer outputs. We evaluate the proposed method in large-scale nuScenes

capable to estimate the vehicle poses under versatile scenarios, which
effectively associates the cross-model information from multi-view images and
global semantic maps. The experiments report satisfactory accuracy with mean
absolute errors of 0.052m, 0.135m and 0.251$^\circ$ in lateral, longitudinal

Existing quantization methods either require hardware overhead to achieve a
non-uniform quantization or focus on model-wise and layer-wise uniform
quantization, which are not as fine-grained as filter-wise quantization. In
this paper, we propose a class-based quantization method to determine the
minimum number of quantization bits for each filter or neuron in DNNs
individually. In the proposed method, the importance score of each filter or
neuron with respect to the number of classes in the dataset is first evaluated.
The larger the score is, the more important the filter or neuron is and thus
the larger the number of quantization bits should be. Afterwards, a search
algorithm is adopted to exploit the different importance of filters and neurons
to determine the number of quantization bits of each filter or neuron.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain the
inference accuracy with low bit-width quantization. Given the same number of
quantization bits, the proposed method can also achieve a better inference

detect 14 different chest conditions from an X ray image. Given an X-ray image
as input, our classifier outputs a label vector indicating which of 14 disease
classes does the image fall into. Along with the image features, we are also
going to use non-image features available in the data such as X-ray view type,

However, due to UAVs' high dynamics and complexity, the real-world deployment

space and terrestrial components, UAVs are expected to meet performance
requirements with high flexibility and dynamics using limited resources.
Therefore, employing UAVs in various usage scenarios requires well-designed
planning in algorithmic approaches. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
review of recent learning-based algorithmic approaches. We consider possible
reward functions and discuss the state-of-the-art algorithms for optimizing the
reward functions, including Q-learning, deep Q-learning, multi-armed bandit
(MAB), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and satisfaction-based learning
algorithms. Unlike other survey papers, we focus on the methodological
perspective of the optimization problem, which can be applicable to various
UAV-assisted missions on a SAGIN using these algorithms. We simulate users and
environments according to real-world scenarios and compare the learning-based
and PSO-based methods in terms of throughput, load, fairness, computation time,
etc. We also implement and evaluate the 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional
(3D) variations of these algorithms to reflect different deployment cases. Our
simulation suggests that the $3$D satisfaction-based learning algorithm
outperforms the other approaches for various metrics in most cases. We discuss

mechanism underlying crystal plasticity, is critical for the hardening,
processing, and application of a wide range of structural and functional
materials[1,7,8]. For decades, the movement of dislocations has been widely
observed in crystalline solids under mechanical loading[9-11]. However, the
goal of manipulating dislocation motion via a non-mechanical field alone
remains elusive. Here, we present real-time observations of dislocation motion
controlled solely by an external electric field in single-crystalline zinc
sulfide (ZnS). We find that 30{\deg} partial dislocations can move back and
forth depending on the direction of the electric field, while 90{\deg} partial
dislocations are motionless. We reveal the nonstoichiometric nature of
dislocation cores using atomistic imaging and determine their charge
characteristics by density functional theory calculations. The glide barriers
of charged 30{\deg} partial dislocations, which are lower than those of
90{\deg} partial dislocations, further decrease under an electric field,
explaining the experimental observations. This study provides direct evidence
of dislocation dynamics under a non-mechanical stimulus and opens up the

Emerging applications and trends of IoT require the ""best of both worlds"":
cheap and low-power SoC systems with a well-known and agile software
environment based on full-fledged OS (e.g., Linux), coupled with extreme energy
efficiency and parallel digital signal processing capabilities. We present
HULK-V: an open-source Heterogeneous Linux-capable RISC-V-based SoC coupling a
64-bit RISC-V processor with an 8-core Programmable Multi-Core Accelerator
(PMCA), delivering up to 13.8 GOps, up to 157 GOps/W and accelerating the
execution of complex DSP and ML tasks by up to 112x over the host processor.
HULK-V leverages a lightweight, fully digital memory hierarchy based on
HyperRAM IoT DRAM that exposes up to 512 MB of DRAM memory to the host CPU.
Featuring HyperRAMs, HULK-V doubles the energy efficiency without significant
performance loss compared to featuring power-hungry LPDDR memories, requiring
expensive and large mixed-signal PHYs. HULK-V, implemented in Global Foundries
22nm FDX technology, is a fully digital ultra-low-cost SoC running a 64-bit

min, near the minimal period of cataclysmic variables. It is unusual in having
a strong mid-infrared excess inconsistent with thermal emission from a brown
dwarf companion. Here we present time-resolved multi-wavelength observations of
this system. WISE photometry indicates that the mid-infrared excess displays a
one-magnitude eclipsing-like variability during the orbit. We obtained
near-infrared and optical spectroscopy using Gemini, MDM and APO telescopes.
Near-infrared spectra show possible cyclotron features indicating that the
white dwarf has a magnetic field of about 5MG. Optical and near-infrared
spectra display double-peaked emission lines, with both components showing
strong radial velocity variations during the orbital period and with the broad
component leading the narrow component stably by about 0.2 of the orbital
phase. We construct a physical model informed by existing observations of the
system and determine that one component likely originates from the accretion
column onto the magnetized white dwarf in synchronous rotation with the orbital
motion and the other from the Roche overflow point. This allows us to constrain
the masses of the binary components to be $M_1>0.24 M_{\odot}$ for the white
dwarf accretor and $M_2=0.0644\pm0.0074 M_\odot$ for the donor. We classify the
system as an AM Herculis star, or a polar. It has likely completed its stint on
the period gap, but has not yet gone through the period bounce.

building a robust FL system, and realizing the wide application of FL, this
paper sorts out the possible attacks and corresponding defenses of the current
FL system systematically. Firstly, this paper briefly introduces the basic
workflow of FL and related knowledge of attacks and defenses. It reviews a
great deal of research about privacy theft and malicious attacks that have been
studied in recent years. Most importantly, in view of the current three
classification criteria, namely the three stages of machine learning, the three
different roles in federated learning, and the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity,
and Availability) guidelines on privacy protection, we divide attack approaches
into two categories according to the training stage and the prediction stage in
machine learning. Furthermore, we also identify the CIA property violated for
each attack method and potential attack role. Various defense mechanisms are
then analyzed separately from the level of privacy and security. Finally, we
summarize the possible challenges in the application of FL from the aspect of
attacks and defenses and discuss the future development direction of FL
systems. In this way, the designed FL system has the ability to resist
different attacks and is more secure and stable.

modes of Kerr have been known for some time. Modes in this family connect to a
Schwarzschild limit where the mode frequency is finite and purely imaginary.
Recently, what was thought to be an additional branch of this original family
of modes was discovered. However, this new branch is actually a part of one of
two entirely new families of total-transmission modes. Modes in these new
families, surprisingly, connect to a Schwarzschild limit where the mode
frequencies exist at complex infinity. We have numerically constructed full
sets of sequences of gravitational total-transmission modes for harmonic
indices $\ell=[2,8]$. Using these numerical sequences, we have been able to
construct analytic asymptotic expansions for the mode frequencies and their
associated separation constants. The asymptotic expansion for the separation
constant used in constructing the total-transmission modes seems to be valid
for general complex values of the oblateness parameter.

in a complex hierarchical structure ranging from fine granularity (e.g.,
words), medium granularity (e.g., regions such as paragraphs or figures), to
coarse granularity (e.g., the whole page). The spatial hierarchical
relationships between content at different levels of granularity are crucial
for document image understanding tasks. Existing methods learn features from
either word-level or region-level but fail to consider both simultaneously.
Word-level models are restricted by the fact that they originate from pure-text
language models, which only encode the word-level context. In contrast,
region-level models attempt to encode regions corresponding to paragraphs or
text blocks into a single embedding, but they perform worse with additional
word-level features. To deal with these issues, we propose MGDoc, a new
multi-modal multi-granular pre-training framework that encodes page-level,
region-level, and word-level information at the same time. MGDoc uses a unified
text-visual encoder to obtain multi-modal features across different
granularities, which makes it possible to project the multi-granular features
into the same hyperspace. To model the region-word correlation, we design a
cross-granular attention mechanism and specific pre-training tasks for our
model to reinforce the model of learning the hierarchy between regions and
words. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed model can learn better
features that perform well across granularities and lead to improvements in
downstream tasks.

model shall perform well on both the perturbed training data and the unseen

To better understand adversarial generalization, it is of great interest to
study the adversarial Rademacher complexity (ARC) of deep neural networks.
However, how to bound ARC in multi-layers cases is largely unclear due to the
difficulty of analyzing adversarial loss in the definition of ARC. There have
been two types of attempts of ARC. One is to provide the upper bound of ARC in
linear and one-hidden layer cases. However, these approaches seem hard to
extend to multi-layer cases. Another is to modify the adversarial loss and
provide upper bounds of Rademacher complexity on such surrogate loss in
multi-layer cases. However, such variants of Rademacher complexity are not
guaranteed to be bounds for meaningful robust generalization gaps (RGG). In
this paper, we provide a solution to this unsolved problem. Specifically, we
provide the first bound of adversarial Rademacher complexity of deep neural
networks. Our approach is based on covering numbers. We provide a method to
handle the robustify function classes of DNNs such that we can calculate the
covering numbers. Finally, we provide experiments to study the empirical

to the system gradually in real time and not altogether in advance. As the
volume of data increases, the domain of the control strategies also increases,
and thus it becomes challenging to search for an optimal strategy. Even if an
optimal control strategy is found, implementing such strategies with increasing
domains is burdensome. To derive an optimal control strategy in CPS, we
typically assume an ideal model of the system. Such model-based control
approaches cannot effectively facilitate optimal solutions with performance
guarantees due to the discrepancy between the model and the actual CPS.
Alternatively, traditional supervised learning approaches cannot always
facilitate robust solutions using data derived offline. Similarly, applying
reinforcement learning approaches directly to the actual CPS might impose
significant implications on safety and robust operation of the system. The goal
of this chapter is to provide a theoretical framework that aims at separating
the control and learning tasks which allows us to combine offline model-based
control with online learning approaches, and thus circumvent the challenges in
deriving optimal control strategies for CPS.

on complementary item recommendations, on the other hand, still remains

interchangeable in terms of their utility and complementary items as items that
serve different purposes, yet are compatible when used with one another. In
this paper, we apply a novel approach to finding complementary items by
leveraging dual embedding representations for products. We demonstrate that the
notion of relatedness discovered in NLP for skip-gram negative sampling (SGNS)
models translates effectively to the concept of complementarity when training
item representations using co-purchase data. Since sparsity of purchase data is
a major challenge in real-world scenarios, we further augment the model using
synthetic samples to extend coverage. This allows the model to provide
complementary recommendations for items that do not share co-purchase data by
leveraging other abundantly available data modalities such as images, text,

coverage and quality of recommendations on real world data for a major online

interested in policies that are adaptive to fluctuations of actual demand
conditions in urban environments, such as on-peak vs. off-peak hours. We
achieve this through a combination of (i) an online play algorithm that
improves the performance of an offline-trained policy, and (ii) an offline
approximation scheme that allows for adapting to changes in the underlying
demand model. In particular, we achieve adaptivity of our learned policy to
different demand distributions by quantifying a region of validity using the
q-valid radius of a Wasserstein Ambiguity Set. We propose a mechanism for
switching the originally trained offline approximation when the current demand
is outside the original validity region. In this case, we propose to use an
offline architecture, trained on a historical demand model that is closer to
the current demand in terms of Wasserstein distance. We learn routing and
pickup policies over real taxicab requests in San Francisco with high

distributions and various image sizes for multi-institutional scans, we apply
the min-max normalization for scaling the intensities of all scans between -1
and 1, and use the voxel size resampling and center cropping to obtain
fixed-size sub-volumes for training. We adopt two data augmentation methods for
effectively learning the semantic information and generating realistic target
domain scans: generative and online data augmentation. For generative data
augmentation, we use CUT and CycleGAN to generate two groups of realistic T2
volumes with different details and appearances for supervised segmentation
training. For online data augmentation, we design a random tumor signal
reducing method for simulating the heterogeneity of VS tumor signals.
Furthermore, we utilize an advanced hybrid convolutional network with
multi-dimensional convolutions to adaptively learn sparse inter-slice
information and dense intra-slice information for accurate volumetric
segmentation of VS tumor and cochlea regions in anisotropic scans. On the
crossMoDA2022 validation dataset, our method produces promising results and
achieves the mean DSC values of 72.47% and 76.48% and ASSD values of 3.42 mm
and 0.53 mm for VS tumor and cochlea regions, respectively.

multi-view data based on the attribute feature and adjacent matrices from
different views. Some attempts have been made in utilizing Graph Neural Network
(GNN), which have achieved promising clustering performance. Despite this, few
of them pay attention to the inherent specific information embedded in multiple
views. Meanwhile, they are incapable of recovering the latent high-level
representation from the low-level ones, greatly limiting the downstream
clustering performance. To fill these gaps, a novel Dual Information enhanced
multi-view Attributed Graph Clustering (DIAGC) method is proposed in this
paper. Specifically, the proposed method introduces the Specific Information
Reconstruction (SIR) module to disentangle the explorations of the consensus
and specific information from multiple views, which enables GCN to capture the
more essential low-level representations. Besides, the Mutual Information
Maximization (MIM) module maximizes the agreement between the latent high-level
representation and low-level ones, and enables the high-level representation to
satisfy the desired clustering structure with the help of the Self-supervised
Clustering (SC) module. Extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DIAGC method compared with the
state-of-the-art baselines.

clutters, and noises, hindering the information retrieval of the target. To
restore the image, current methods make simplified assumptions; for example,
the point spread function (PSF) is spatially consistent, the target consists of
sparse point scatters, etc. Thus, they achieve limited restoration performance
in terms of the target's shape, especially for complex targets. To address
these issues, a preliminary study is conducted on restoration with the recent
promising deep learning inverse technique in this work. We reformulate the
degradation model into a spatially variable complex-convolution model, where
the near-field SAR's system response is considered. Adhering to it, a
model-based deep learning network is designed to restore the image. A simulated
degraded image dataset from multiple complex target models is constructed to
validate the network. All the images are formulated using the electromagnetic

fundamental interest to understand the transition from the coherent to
incoherent regimes. We find that hitherto unrecognized quasiparticles --
incoherentons -- describe this coherent-to-incoherent transition in eigenmodes
of a Liouvillian superoperator that governs the dynamics of an open quantum
many-body system. Here, an incoherenton is defined as an interchain bound state
in an auxiliary ladder system that represents the density matrix of a system.
The Liouvillian eigenmodes are classified into groups with different decay
rates that reflect the number of incoherentons involved therein. We also
introduce a spectral gap -- quantum coherence gap -- that separates the
different groups of eigenmodes. We demonstrate the existence of incoherentons
in a lattice boson model subject to dephasing, and show that the quantum
coherence gap closes when incoherentons are deconfined, which signals a
dynamical transition from incoherent relaxation with exponential decay to
coherent oscillatory relaxation. Furthermore, we discuss how the decoherence
dynamics of quantum many-body systems can be understood in terms of the
generation, localization, and diffusion of incoherentons.

exploiting Anderson acceleration (AA) that is capable of efficiently solving

on the Q-function approximation (QMDP) method to alleviate the scalability
issue inherent in POMDPs. Inspired by the quasi-Newton interpretation of AA, we
propose a maximum entropy variant of QMDP, which we call soft QMDP, to fully
benefit from AA. We prove that the overall algorithm converges to the

each range-azimuth unit individually. However, only one-dimensional features
are effectively utilized in this way. The correlation between adjacent
resolution units is ignored directly. To address that, we propose a new
model-data-driven network to achieve tomoSAR imaging based on multi-dimensional
features. Guided by the deep unfolding methodology, a two-dimensional deep
unfolding imaging network is constructed. On the basis of it, we add two 2D
processing modules, both convolutional encoder-decoder structures, to enhance
multi-dimensional features of the imaging scene effectively. Meanwhile, to
train the proposed multifeature-based imaging network, we construct a tomoSAR
simulation dataset consisting entirely of simulation data of buildings.
Experiments verify the effectiveness of the model. Compared with the
conventional CS-based FISTA method and DL-based gamma-Net method, the result of
our proposed method has better performance on completeness while having decent
imaging accuracy.

  Chen","STAGE: Span Tagging and Greedy Inference Scheme for Aspect Sentiment
  Triplet Extraction","Accepted by AAAI 2023",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) has become an emerging task in
sentiment analysis research, aiming to extract triplets of the aspect term, its
corresponding opinion term, and its associated sentiment polarity from a given
sentence. Recently, many neural networks based models with different tagging
schemes have been proposed, but almost all of them have their limitations:
heavily relying on 1) prior assumption that each word is only associated with a
single role (e.g., aspect term, or opinion term, etc. ) and 2) word-level
interactions and treating each opinion/aspect as a set of independent words.
Hence, they perform poorly on the complex ASTE task, such as a word associated
with multiple roles or an aspect/opinion term with multiple words. Hence, we
propose a novel approach, Span TAgging and Greedy infErence (STAGE), to extract
sentiment triplets in span-level, where each span may consist of multiple words
and play different roles simultaneously. To this end, this paper formulates the
ASTE task as a multi-class span classification problem. Specifically, STAGE
generates more accurate aspect sentiment triplet extractions via exploring
span-level information and constraints, which consists of two components,
namely, span tagging scheme and greedy inference strategy. The former tag all
possible candidate spans based on a newly-defined tagging set. The latter
retrieves the aspect/opinion term with the maximum length from the candidate
sentiment snippet to output sentiment triplets. Furthermore, we propose a
simple but effective model based on the STAGE, which outperforms the
state-of-the-arts by a large margin on four widely-used datasets. Moreover, our
STAGE can be easily generalized to other pair/triplet extraction tasks, which
also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme STAGE.

outputs with the preferences of a prototypical user. This work assumes that
human preferences are static and homogeneous across individuals, so that
aligning to a a single ""generic"" user will confer more general alignment. Here,
we embrace the heterogeneity of human preferences to consider a different
challenge: how might a machine help people with diverse views find agreement?
We fine-tune a 70 billion parameter LLM to generate statements that maximize
the expected approval for a group of people with potentially diverse opinions.
Human participants provide written opinions on thousands of questions touching
on moral and political issues (e.g., ""should we raise taxes on the rich?""), and
rate the LLM's generated candidate consensus statements for agreement and
quality. A reward model is then trained to predict individual preferences,
enabling it to quantify and rank consensus statements in terms of their appeal
to the overall group, defined according to different aggregation (social
welfare) functions. The model produces consensus statements that are preferred
by human users over those from prompted LLMs (>70%) and significantly
outperforms a tight fine-tuned baseline that lacks the final ranking step.
Further, our best model's consensus statements are preferred over the best
human-generated opinions (>65%). We find that when we silently constructed
consensus statements from only a subset of group members, those who were
excluded were more likely to dissent, revealing the sensitivity of the
consensus to individual contributions. These results highlight the potential to
use LLMs to help groups of humans align their values with one another.

order to form functional organs. Similarly, in adult animals, living cells and
tissues are continually subjected to forces and deformations. Therefore, the
success of embryonic development and the proper maintenance of physiological
functions rely on the ability of cells to withstand mechanical stresses as well
as their ability flow in a collective manner. During these events, mechanical
perturbations can originate from active processes at the single cell, competing
with external stresses exerted by surrounding tissues and organs. However, the
study of tissue mechanics has been somewhat limited to either the response to
external forces or to intrinsic ones. In this work, we study theoretically the
interplay of external deformations that are applied globally to a tissue as a
whole with internal active stresses that arise locally at the cellular level
due to cell motility. We elucidate in particular the way in which this
interplay between globally external and locally internal active driving
determines the emergent mechanical properties of the tissue as a whole. For a
tissue in the vicinity of a solid-fluid jamming/unjamming transition, we
uncover a host of fascinating rheological phenomena, including yielding, shear
thinning, continuous shear thickening (CST) and discontinuous shear thickening
(DST). These model predictions provide a framework for understanding the

protection in the past decade. We use Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) in
gauging the level of privacy protection for releasing statistical summaries
from data. The GDP is a natural and easy-to-interpret differential privacy
criterion based on the statistical hypothesis testing framework. The Gaussian
mechanism is a natural and fundamental mechanism that can be used to perturb
multivariate statistics to satisfy a $\mu$-GDP criterion, where $\mu>0$ stands
for the level of privacy protection. Requiring a certain level of differential
privacy inevitably leads to a loss of statistical utility. We improve ordinary
Gaussian mechanisms by developing rank-deficient James-Stein Gaussian
mechanisms for releasing private multivariate statistics, and show that the
proposed mechanisms have higher statistical utilities. Laplace mechanisms, the
most commonly used mechanisms in the pure DP framework, are also investigated
under the GDP criterion. We show that optimal calibration of multivariate
Laplace mechanisms requires more information on the statistic than just the
global sensitivity, and derive the minimal amount of Laplace perturbation for
releasing $\mu$-GDP contingency tables. Gaussian mechanisms are shown to have
higher statistical utilities than Laplace mechanisms, except for very low
levels of privacy. The utility of proposed multivariate mechanisms is further
demonstrated using differentially private hypotheses tests on contingency
tables. Bootstrap-based goodness-of-fit and homogeneity tests, utilizing the

compression methods. Overall, the AcceRL consists of five components, namely
Actor, Learner, Compressor, Corrector, and Monitor. The Actor uses the
Compressor to compress the Learner's policy network to interact with the
environment. And the generated experiences are transformed by the Corrector
with Off-Policy methods, such as V-trace, Retrace and so on. Then the corrected
experiences are feed to the Learner for policy learning. We believe this is the
first general reinforcement learning framework that incorporates multiple
neural network compression techniques. Extensive experiments conducted in gym
show that the AcceRL reduces the time cost of the actor by about 2.0 X to 4.13
X compared to the traditional methods. Furthermore, the AcceRL reduces the
whole training time by about 29.8% to 40.3% compared to the traditional methods
while keeps the same policy quality.

curvature if the boundary is not empty), is both the necessary and sufficient
condition for prescribing scalar curvature problems within conformal class $
[g] $, provided that the first eigenvalue of the conformal Laplacian is zero.
We then extend the same necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of
prescribing Gauss curvature function and zero geodesic curvature, to compact
Riemann surfaces with non-empty boundary, provided that the Euler
characteristic is zero. These results are the first full extensions since the
results of Kazdan and Warner \cite{KW2} on 2-dimensional torus, and of Escobar
and Schoen \cite{ESS} on closed manifolds for dimensions $ 3 $ and $ 4 $. We
then give results of prescribing nonzero scalar and mean curvature problems on

compact Riemann surfaces with boundary are given for zero Euler characteristic
case. Lastly, we show a generalization of the Han-Li conjecture. Technically
the key step for manifolds with dimensions at least $ 3 $ is to apply both the
local variational methods, local Yamabe-type equations and a new version of the
monotone iteration scheme. The key features include the smoothness of the upper
solution, the technical difference between constant and non-constant
prescribing scalar curvature functions, etc.

device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD), since any loophole could be
used by a potential adversary to undermine the security of the protocol.
Crucial work by Eberhard demonstrated that weakly entangled two-qubit states
have a far greater resistance to the detection loophole than maximally
entangled states, allowing one to close the loophole with detection efficiency
greater than 2/3. Here we demonstrate that this same limit holds for
photon-counting CHSH Bell tests which can demonstrate non-locality for higher
dimensional multiphoton states such as two-mode squeezed vacuum and generalized
Holland-Burnett states. In fact, we show evidence that these tests are in some
sense universal, allowing feasible detection loophole-free tests for any
multiphoton bipartite state, as long as the two modes are well correlated in
photon number. Additionally, by going beyond the typical two-input two-output
Bell scenario, we show that there are also photon-counting CGLMP inequalities
which can also match the Eberhard limit, paving the way for more exotic
loophole-free Bell tests. Finally we show that by exploiting this increased
loss tolerance of non maximally entangled states, one can increase the key
rates and loss tolerances of QKD protocols based on photon-counting tests.

the issue of applying the policy gradient theorem to the quantile and provides

the derived theoretical results and the technique of the Lagrange multiplier,
we construct a constrained RL algorithm named Quantile Constrained Policy

sum cost for the implementation of QCPO. The implemented algorithm satisfies
the outage probability constraint after the training period.

equivalent except for their gap structures. Indeed, the boundary zero modes do

contraction information for robotic hand prosthesis controllers. Widely applied

essential for accurate predictions. Recently, a novel predictor of hand
movements adopts a multistage Sequential, Adaptive Functional Estimation (SAFE)
method based on historical Functional Linear Model (FLM) to select important
EMG signals and provide precise projections.
  However, SAFE repeatedly performs matrix-vector multiplications with a dense
representation matrix of the integral operator for the FLM, which is
computational expansive. Noting that with a properly chosen basis, the
representation of the integral operator concentrates on a few bands of the
basis, the goal of this study is to develop a fast Multiscale SAFE (MSAFE)
method aiming at reducing computational costs while preserving (or even
improving) the accuracy of the original SAFE method. Specifically, a multiscale
piecewise polynomial basis is adopted to discretize the integral operator for
the FLM, resulting in an approximately sparse representation matrix, and then
the matrix is truncated to a sparse one. This approach not only accelerates
computations but also improves robustness against noises. When applied to real
hand movement data, MSAFE saves 85%$\sim$90% computing time compared with SAFE,
while producing better sensor selection and comparable accuracy. In a
simulation study, MSAFE shows stronger stability in sensor selection and
prediction accuracy against correlated noise than SAFE.

changing communities in dynamic networks is an important research topic that
poses challenging tasks. Most existing methods assume that no significant
change in the network occurs; namely, the difference between adjacent snapshots
is slight. However, great change exists in the real world usually. The great
change in the network will result in the community detection algorithms are
difficulty obtaining valuable information from the previous snapshot, leading
to negative transfer for the next time steps. This paper focuses on dynamic
community detection with substantial changes by integrating higher-order
knowledge from the previous snapshots to aid the subsequent snapshots.
Moreover, to improve search efficiency, a higher-order knowledge transfer
strategy is designed to determine first-order and higher-order knowledge by
detecting the similarity of the adjacency matrix of snapshots. In this way, our
proposal can better keep the advantages of previous community detection results
and transfer them to the next task. We conduct the experiments on four
real-world networks, including the networks with great or minor changes.
Experimental results in the low-similarity datasets demonstrate that
higher-order knowledge is more valuable than first-order knowledge when the
network changes significantly and keeps the advantage even if handling the

  2022",,,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  State estimation is important for a variety of tasks, from forecasting to
substituting for unmeasured states in feedback controllers. Performing
real-time state estimation for PDEs using provably and rapidly converging
observers, such as those based on PDE backstepping, is computationally
expensive and in many cases prohibitive. We propose a framework for
accelerating PDE observer computations using learning-based approaches that are
much faster while maintaining accuracy. In particular, we employ the
recently-developed Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to learn the functional
mapping from the initial observer state and boundary measurements to the state
estimate. By employing backstepping observer gains for previously-designed
observers with particular convergence rate guarantees, we provide numerical
experiments that evaluate the increased computational efficiency gained with
FNO. We consider the state estimation for three benchmark PDE examples
motivated by applications: first, for a reaction-diffusion (parabolic) PDE
whose state is estimated with an exponential rate of convergence; second, for a
parabolic PDE with exact prescribed-time estimation; and, third, for a pair of
coupled first-order hyperbolic PDEs that modeling traffic flow density and
velocity. The ML-accelerated observers trained on simulation data sets for
these PDEs achieves up to three orders of magnitude improvement in
computational speed compared to classical methods. This demonstrates the
attractiveness of the ML-accelerated observers for real-time state estimation
and control.

novel framework, i.e., CLIP2GAN, by leveraging CLIP model and StyleGAN. The key
idea of our CLIP2GAN is to bridge the output feature embedding space of CLIP
and the input latent space of StyleGAN, which is realized by introducing a
mapping network. In the training stage, we encode an image with CLIP and map
the output feature to a latent code, which is further used to reconstruct the
image. In this way, the mapping network is optimized in a self-supervised
learning way. In the inference stage, since CLIP can embed both image and text
into a shared feature embedding space, we replace CLIP image encoder in the
training architecture with CLIP text encoder, while keeping the following
mapping network as well as StyleGAN model. As a result, we can flexibly input a
text description to generate an image. Moreover, by simply adding mapped text
features of an attribute to a mapped CLIP image feature, we can effectively
edit the attribute to the image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance of our proposed CLIP2GAN compared to previous methods.

cycle-consistent adversarial networks (PCT-CycleGAN) for radar-based
precipitation nowcasting, inspired by cycle-consistent adversarial networks
(CycleGAN), which shows strong performance in image-to-image translation.
PCT-CycleGAN generates temporal causality using two generator networks with
forward and backward temporal dynamics in paired complementary cycles. Each
generator network learns a huge number of one-to-one mappings about
time-dependent radar-based precipitation data to approximate a mapping function
representing the temporal dynamics in each direction. To create robust temporal
causality between paired complementary cycles, novel connection loss is
proposed. And torrential loss to cover exceptional heavy rain events is also
proposed. The generator network learning forward temporal dynamics in
PCT-CycleGAN generates radar-based precipitation data 10 minutes from the
current time. Also, it provides a reliable prediction of up to 2 hours with
iterative forecasting. The superiority of PCT-CycleGAN is demonstrated through
qualitative and quantitative comparisons with several previous methods.

(2) a novel regularity criterion for the 3D NSE based on finitely many

utilizes nudging, a method based on a Newtonian relaxation scheme motivated by
feedback-control. The observations, which may be either modal, nodal or volume
elements, are drawn from a weak solution of the 3D NSE and are collected almost
everywhere in time over a finite grid and our results, including the regularity
criterion, hold for data of any of the aforementioned forms. The regularity
criterion we propose follows from our data assimilation algorithm and is hence
intimately connected to the notion of determining functionals (modes, nodes and
volume elements). To the best of our knowledge, all existing regularity
criteria require knowing the solution of the 3D NSE almost everywhere in space.
Our regularity criterion is fundamentally different from any preexisting
regularity criterion as it is based on finitely many observations (modes, nodes
and volume elements). We further prove that the regularity criterion we propose
is both a necessary and sufficient condition for regularity. Thus our result
can be viewed as a natural generalization of the notion of determining modes,
nodes and volume elements as well as the asymptotic tracking property of the
nudging algorithm for the 2D NSE to the 3D setting.

the centered and appropriately scaled steady state queue length distribution
(hereafter referred to as limiting distribution), in the limit as the
abandonment rate goes to zero at the same time as the load either converges to
one or is larger than one.
  Depending on the arrival, service, and abandonment rates, we observe three
different regimes of operation that yield three different limiting
distributions. The first regime is when the system is underloaded and its load
converges relatively slowly to one. In this case, abandonments do not affect
the limiting distribution, and we obtain the same exponential distribution as
in the system without abandonments. When the load converges to one faster, we
have the second regime, where abandonments become significant. Here, the system
undergoes a phase transition, and the limiting distribution is a truncated
Gaussian. Further, the third regime is when the system is heavily overloaded,
and so the queue lengths are very large. In this case, we show the limiting
distribution converges to a normal distribution.
  To establish our results, we first prove a weaker form of State Space
Collapse by providing a uniform bound on the second moment of the (unscaled)
perpendicular component of the queue lengths, which shows that the system
behaves like a single server queue. We then use exponential Lyapunov functions

significant research problem in computer graphics and computer vision.
Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown impressive novel view
rendering results and has been considered for facial avatar reconstruction.
However, the complex facial dynamics and missing 3D information in monocular
videos raise significant challenges for faithful facial reconstruction. In this
work, we propose a new method for NeRF-based facial avatar reconstruction that
utilizes 3D-aware generative prior. Different from existing works that depend
on a conditional deformation field for dynamic modeling, we propose to learn a
personalized generative prior, which is formulated as a local and low
dimensional subspace in the latent space of 3D-GAN. We propose an efficient
method to construct the personalized generative prior based on a small set of
facial images of a given individual. After learning, it allows for
photo-realistic rendering with novel views and the face reenactment can be
realized by performing navigation in the latent space. Our proposed method is
applicable for different driven signals, including RGB images, 3DMM
coefficients, and audios. Compared with existing works, we obtain superior
novel view synthesis results and faithfully face reenactment performance.

broad category of offline RL algorithms fulfills pessimism by explicit or
implicit behavior regularization. However, most of them only consider policy
divergence as behavior regularization, ignoring the effect of how the offline
state distribution differs with that of the learning policy, which may lead to
under-pessimism for some states and over-pessimism for others. Taking account
of this problem, we propose a principled algorithmic framework for offline RL,
called \emph{State-Aware Proximal Pessimism} (SA-PP). The key idea of SA-PP is
leveraging discounted stationary state distribution ratios between the learning
policy and the offline dataset to modulate the degree of behavior
regularization in a state-wise manner, so that pessimism can be implemented in
a more appropriate way. We first provide theoretical justifications on the
superiority of SA-PP over previous algorithms, demonstrating that SA-PP
produces a lower suboptimality upper bound in a broad range of settings.
Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm named \emph{State-Aware Conservative
Q-Learning} (SA-CQL), by building SA-PP upon representative CQL algorithm with
the help of DualDICE for estimating discounted stationary state distribution
ratios. Extensive experiments on standard offline RL benchmark show that SA-CQL

deep policy network with a novel tree search algorithm, where the tree search
explores the problem space, and the deep policy network leverages
self-generated experience to guide the search further. This framework first
demonstrates an ability to discover high-performing generative strategies

of generative strategies across various unseen boundary conditions. This work
evaluates the effectiveness and versatility of the framework by solving
multiple versions of two engineering design problems without retraining.
Overall, this paper presents a methodology to self-learn high-performing and

explosion, which means that a node accesses its multi-hop neighbors. On the
other hand, layer-wise inference avoids the neighbor explosion problem by
conducting inference layer by layer such that the nodes only need their one-hop
neighbors in each layer. However, implementing layer-wise inference requires
substantial engineering efforts because users need to manually decompose a GNN
model into layers for computation and split workload into batches to fit into

three-dimensional hole pocket at the G point is commonly seen for two types of
single-crystalline samples fabricated by different growth conditions. On the
other hand, the carrier-doping level estimated from the position of the
chemical potential was found to be sensitive to the sample fabrication

role of the three-dimensional hole pocket to the occurrence of
superconductivity, and further points to an intriguing possibility to control
the topological nature of superconductivity by carrier tuning in CaSb2.

  Instability",,,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The self-interaction of short electron bunches with their own radiation field
can have a significant impact on the longitudinal beam dynamics in a storage
ring. While higher bunch currents increase the power of the emitted CSR which
can be provided to dedicated experiments, it simultaneously amplifies the
strength of the self-interaction. Eventually, this leads to the formation of
dynamically changing micro-structures within the bunch and thus fluctuating CSR
emission, a phenomenon that is generally known as micro-bunching or micro-wave
instability. The underlying longitudinal dynamics can be simulated by solving
the VFP equation, where the CSR self-interaction can be added as a perturbation
to the Hamiltonian. In this contribution, we focus on the perturbation of the
synchrotron motion that is caused by introducing this additional wake field.
Therefore, we adopt the perspective of a single particle and eventually comment
on its implications for collective motion. We explicitly show how the shape of
the parallel plates CSR wake potential breaks homogeneity in the longitudinal
phase space and propose a quadrupole-like mode as potential seeding mechanism
of the micro-bunching instability. Moreover, we consider synchrotron motion
above the instability threshold and thereby motivate an approach to control of
the occurring micro-bunching dynamics. Using dynamically adjusted RF amplitude
modulations we can directly address the continuous CSR-induced perturbation at
the timescale of its occurrence, which allows for substantial control over the
longitudinal charge distribution. While the approach is not limited to this
particular application, we demonstrate how this can significantly mitigate the
micro-bunching dynamics directly above the instability threshold. The gained
insights are supported and verified using the VFP solver Inovesa and put into
context with measurements at KARA.

should also be considered for training modern deep neural networks. To address
miscalibration during learning, some methods have explored different penalty
functions as part of the learning objective, alongside a standard
classification loss, with a hyper-parameter controlling the relative
contribution of each term. Nevertheless, these methods share two major
drawbacks: 1) the scalar balancing weight is the same for all classes,
hindering the ability to address different intrinsic difficulties or imbalance
among classes; and 2) the balancing weight is usually fixed without an adaptive
strategy, which may prevent from reaching the best compromise between accuracy
and calibration, and requires hyper-parameter search for each application. We
propose Class Adaptive Label Smoothing (CALS) for calibrating deep networks,
which allows to learn class-wise multipliers during training, yielding a
powerful alternative to common label smoothing penalties. Our method builds on
a general Augmented Lagrangian approach, a well-established technique in
constrained optimization, but we introduce several modifications to tailor it

which dynamically induces the spontaneous breaking of the U(1) spin-rotational

this dynamic easy-cone state, we show theoretically that superfluid-like spin

model selection. Temporal cross validation (TCV) is a standard technique to
perform model selection in forecasting tasks. TCV sequentially partitions the
training time series into train and validation windows, and performs
hyperparameter optmization (HPO) of the forecast model to select the model with
the best validation performance. Model selection with TCV often leads to poor
test performance when the test data distribution differs from that of the
validation data. We propose a novel model selection method, H-Pro that exploits
the data hierarchy often associated with a time series dataset. Generally, the
aggregated data at the higher levels of the hierarchy show better
predictability and more consistency compared to the bottom-level data which is
more sparse and (sometimes) intermittent. H-Pro performs the HPO of the
lowest-level student model based on the test proxy forecasts obtained from a
set of teacher models at higher levels in the hierarchy. The consistency of the
teachers' proxy forecasts help select better student models at the
lowest-level. We perform extensive empirical studies on multiple datasets to
validate the efficacy of the proposed method. H-Pro along with off-the-shelf
forecasting models outperform existing state-of-the-art forecasting methods
including the winning models of the M5 point-forecasting competition.

a two-dome-shaped SC phase regime in CsV3Sb5 accompanied by the destabilizing
of CDW phase; such unconventional evolution of SC may involve the
pressure-induced formation of a new stripe-like CDW order resembling that in
La-214 cuprate superconductors. Nonetheless, the nature of this pressure-tuned
SC state and its interplay with the stripe order are yet to be explored. Here,
we perform soft point-contact spectroscopy (SPCS) measurements in CsV3Sb5 to
investigate the evolution of superconducting order parameter with pressure.
Surprisingly, we find that the superconducting gap is significantly enhanced
between the two SC domes, at which the zero-resistance temperature is
suppressed and the transition is remarkably broadened. Moreover, the
temperature dependence of the SC gap in this pressure range severely deviates
from the conventional BCS behavior, evidencing for strong Cooper pair phase

an untrimmed video with several temporal event locations in coherent

effectively understood by decomposing it into visual (e.g. human, animal) and
non-visual components (e.g. action, relations) under the mutual influence of
vision and language, we first propose a visual-linguistic (VL) feature. In the
proposed VL feature, the scene is modeled by three modalities including (i) a
global visual environment; (ii) local visual main agents; (iii) linguistic
scene elements. We then introduce an autoregressive Transformer-in-Transformer
(TinT) to simultaneously capture the semantic coherence of intra- and
inter-event contents within a video. Finally, we present a new VL contrastive
loss function to guarantee learnt embedding features are matched with the

verifying arbitrary control inputs with respect to future constraint
satisfaction. The approach relies on the solution of two optimization problems
computing the minimal constraint relaxations given the current state, and then
computing the minimal deviation from a proposed input such that the relaxed
constraints are satisfied. This paper presents an approximation procedure that
uses a neural network to approximate the optimal value function of the first
optimization problem from samples, such that the computation becomes
independent of the prediction horizon. It is shown that this approximation
guarantees that states converge to a neighborhood of the implicitly defined
safe set of the original problem, where system constraints can be satisfied for
all times forward. The convergence result relies on a novel class $\mathcal{K}$
lower bound on the PCBF decrease and depends on the approximation error of the
neural network. Lastly, we demonstrate our approach in simulation for an
autonomous driving example and show that the proposed approximation leads to a
significant decrease in computation time compared to the original approach.

691 malaria parasites of thin blood smears. The dataset is named PlasmoID, and
most data comes from rural Indonesia. PlasmoID also provides ground truth for
parasite detection and segmentation purposes. Second, this study proposes a
malaria parasite segmentation and detection scheme by combining Faster RCNN and
a semantic segmentation technique. The proposed scheme has been evaluated on
the PlasmoID dataset. It has been compared with recent studies of semantic

gradient, in the classical limit (high temperature). The development is kept
basic as far as geometry and experimental conditions are concerned, enabling an
almost fully analytic treatment. In the modeling, each of the modes is subject
to a specific Langevin force, which enables to produce the required temperature
profile along the rod. The theory is predictive: the temperature gradient (and
therefore energy transport) is linked to motion amplitude cross-correlations
between nearby mechanical modes. This arises because energy transport is
actually mediated by mixing between the modal waves, and not by the modes
themselves. This result can be tested on experiments, and shall extend the
concepts underlying equipartition and fluctuation-dissipation theorems. The
theory links intimately the macroscopic size of the clamping region where the
mixing occurs to the microscopic lengthscale of the problem at hand: the phonon
mean-free-path. This clamping region, which is key, has received recently a

visual Transformers to learn multiple-view geometry but allowing them to break

Transformer's cross-attention maps, penalizing attention values outside the
epipolar lines and encouraging higher attention along these lines since they
contain geometrically plausible matches. Unlike previous methods, our proposal
does not require any camera pose information at test-time. We focus on
pose-invariant object instance retrieval, where standard Transformer networks
struggle, due to the large differences in viewpoint between query and retrieved

Nowadays, some chiroptical methods of enantiodetection based on
decoherence-free cyclic three-level models of chiral molecules can reach the
ultimate limit of the enantioselectivities in the molecular responses. They are
thus more efficient than traditional chiroptical methods. However, decoherence
is inevitable and can severely reduce enantioselectivities in these advanced
chiroptical methods, so they only work well in the weak decoherence region.
Here, we propose an enantioselective switch on the radiation of dissipative
chiral molecules and develop a novel chiroptical method of enantiodetection
working well in all decoherence regions. In our scheme, radiation is turned on
for the selected enantiomer and simultaneously turned off for its mirror image
by designing the electromagnetic fields well based on dissipative cyclic
three-level models. The enantiomeric excess of a chiral mixture is determined
by comparing its emissions in two cases, where the radiations of two
enantiomers are turned off respectively. The corresponding enantioselectivities
reach the ultimate limit in all decoherence regions, offering our scheme
advantages over other chiroptical methods in enantiodetection. Our work
potentially constitutes the starting point for developing more efficient
chiroptical techniques for enantiodection in all decoherence regions.

hurt model's generalization and discriminative ability. Furthermore, the
coupled training approach prevents these models transferring category-specific
knowledge explicitly from labeled data to unlabeled data, which can lose
high-level semantic information and impair model performance. To mitigate above
limitations, we present a novel model called Decoupled Prototypical Network

can not only decouple known and novel categories to achieve different training
targets effectively, but also align known categories in labeled and unlabeled
data to transfer category-specific knowledge explicitly and capture high-level
semantics. Furthermore, DPN can learn more discriminative features for both
known and novel categories through our proposed Semantic-aware Prototypical

alleviate the noise of hard pseudo labels through semantic-weighted soft

using Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) WALLABY pilot survey
observations. We compare the HI properties of galaxy pair candidates in the
Hydra I and Norma clusters, and the NGC 4636 group, with those of non-paired
control galaxies selected in the same fields. We perform HI profile
decomposition of the sample galaxies using a tool, {\sc baygaud} which allows
us to de-blend a line-of-sight velocity profile with an optimal number of
Gaussian components. We construct HI super-profiles of the sample galaxies via
stacking of their line profiles after aligning the central velocities. We fit a
double Gaussian model to the super-profiles and classify them as kinematically
narrow and broad components with respect to their velocity dispersions.
Additionally, we investigate the gravitational instability of HI gas disks of
the sample galaxies using Toomre Q parameters and HI morphological
disturbances. We investigate the effect of the cluster environment on the HI
properties of galaxy pairs by dividing the cluster environment into three
subcluster regions (i.e., outskirts, infalling and central regions). We find
that the denser cluster environment (i.e., infalling and central regions) is
likely to impact the HI gas properties of galaxies in a way of decreasing the
amplitude of the kinematically narrow HI gas
($M_{\rm{narrow}}^{\rm{HI}}$/$M_{\rm{total}}^{\rm{HI}}$), and increasing the
Toomre Q values of the infalling and central galaxies. This tendency is likely
to be more enhanced for galaxy pairs in the cluster environment.

photo-voltages in bulk materials. Unlike photo-voltages in p-n junction solar
cells that are limited by carrier recombination to values below the bandgap
energy of the absorbing material, the BPVE photo-voltages have been shown to
greatly exceed the bandgap energy. Therefore the BPVE is not subject to the
Shockley-Queisser limit for sunlight to electricity conversion in single
junction solar cells and experimental claims of efficiencies beyond this limit
have been made. Here, we show that BPVE energy conversion efficiencies are, in
practice, orders of magnitude below the Shockley-Queisser limit of single
junction solar cells and are subject to different, more stringent limits. The
name BPVE stands for two different fundamental effects, the shift current and
the injection current. In both of these, the voltage bias necessary to produce
electrical energy, accelerates both, intrinsic and photo-generated, carriers.
We discuss how energy conservation alone fundamentally limits the BPVE to a
bandgap-dependent value that exceeds the Shockley Queisser limit only for very
small bandgaps. Yet, small bandgap materials have a large number of intrinsic
carriers, leading to high conductivity which suppresses the photo-voltage. We
discuss further how slightly more stringent fundamental limits for injection
(ballistic) currents may be derived from the trade-off between high
resistivity, needed for a high voltage, and long ballistic transport length,
needed for a high current. We also explain how erroneous experimental and
theoretical claims of high efficiency have arisen. Finally, we calculate the
energy conversion efficiency for an example 2D material that has been suggested
as candidate material for high efficiency BPVE based solar cells and show that
the efficiency is very similar to the efficiency of known 3D materials.

Fourier approach, is introduced. The method relies on a Hamiltonian
decomposition, where except of the components depending exclusively on the
momentum or on the position operators, there are also terms depending on both
momentum and position operators in particular configurations. We demonstrate
that, for as long as the latter does not depend on noncommuting coordinates of
the momentum and position operators, nondipole effects in laser-matter
interactions can be studied without applying extra unitary operations.
Specifically, we analyze the effect of nondipole corrections in ionization of a
two-dimensional hydrogen atom for low- and high-frequency pulses. In the former
case, the electron wave packet dynamics is dominated by rescattering processes
within the laser pulse, leading to the high-order harmonic generation. We
illustrate that harmonics of even orders are generated in the direction of the
laser field polarization. On the contrary, for high-frequency pulses, such
rescattering processes can be neglected. We demonstrate that a significant
portion of the low-energy photoelectrons is detected opposite to the laser
pulse propagation direction as a consequence of their post-pulse wave packet
spreading and interaction with the parent ion.

safety-critical autonomous systems, such as unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The visual odometry-based method can provide
accurate positioning in a short period but is subjected to drift over time.
Moreover, the quantification of the safety of the localization solution (the
error is bounded by a certain value) is still a challenge. To fill the gaps,
this paper proposes a safety-quantifiable line feature-based visual
localization method with a prior map. The visual-inertial odometry provides a
high-frequency local pose estimation which serves as the initial guess for the
visual localization. By obtaining a visual line feature pair association, a
foot point-based constraint is proposed to construct the cost function between
the 2D lines extracted from the real-time image and the 3D lines extracted from
the high-precision prior 3D point cloud map. Moreover, a global navigation
satellite systems (GNSS) receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM)
inspired method is employed to quantify the safety of the derived localization
solution. Among that, an outlier rejection (also well-known as fault detection
and exclusion) strategy is employed via the weighted sum of squares residual
with a Chi-squared probability distribution. A protection level (PL) scheme
considering multiple outliers is derived and utilized to quantify the potential
error bound of the localization solution in both position and rotation domains.
The effectiveness of the proposed safety-quantifiable localization system is
verified using the datasets collected in the UAV indoor and UGV outdoor
environments.

understanding the dynamical effects of ESQPTs. In such systems, the highly
controllable spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer an exceptional
platform to study ESQPTs. In this work, we investigate the dynamical
characteristics of the ESQPT in spin-$1$ BEC by means of the Loschmidt echo
spectrum. The Loschmidt echo spectrum is an extension of the well-known
Loschmidt echo and definded as the overlaps between the evolved state and the
excited states of the initial Hamiltonian. We show that both the time evolved
and long time averaged Loschmidt echo spectrum undergo a remarkable change as
the system passes through the critical point of the ESQPT. Moreover, the
particular behavior exhibited by the Loschmidt echo spectrum at the critical
point stand as a dynamical detector for probing the ESQPT. We further
demonstrate how to capture the features of the ESQPT by using the energy
distribution associated with the Loschmidt echo spectrum for time evolved and
long time averaged cases, respectrively. Our findings contribute to a further
verification of the usefulness of the Loschmidt echo spectrum for witnessing
various quantum phase transitions in many-body systems and provide a new way to
experimentally examine the dynamical consequences of ESQPTs.

been acknowledged as the most dominant method for image classification.
However, a severe drawback of deep convolutional neural networks is poor
explainability. Unfortunately, in many real-world applications, users need to
understand the rationale behind the predictions of deep convolutional neural
networks when determining whether they should trust the predictions or not. To
resolve this issue, a novel genetic algorithm-based method is proposed for the
first time to automatically evolve local explanations that can assist users to
assess the rationality of the predictions. Furthermore, the proposed method is
model-agnostic, i.e., it can be utilised to explain any deep convolutional
neural network models. In the experiments, ResNet is used as an example model
to be explained, and the ImageNet dataset is selected as the benchmark dataset.
DenseNet and MobileNet are further explained to demonstrate the model-agnostic
characteristic of the proposed method. The evolved local explanations on four
images, randomly selected from ImageNet, are presented, which show that the
evolved local explanations are straightforward to be recognised by humans.
Moreover, the evolved explanations can explain the predictions of deep
convolutional neural networks on all four images very well by successfully
capturing meaningful interpretable features of the sample images. Further
analysis based on the 30 runs of the experiments exhibits that the evolved
local explanations can also improve the probabilities/confidences of the deep
convolutional neural network models in making the predictions. The proposed
method can obtain local explanations within one minute, which is more than ten
times faster than LIME (the state-of-the-art method).

we train a single policy on 40 games with near-human performance using up-to 80

counterpropagating optical fields, the self-starting of the mode-locked fiber
laser with a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror (NALM) is theoretically studied.
Although it is generally believed that NALM shows a saturable absorption effect
on both continuous wave (CW) light and pulses, we find a counter-intuitive fact
that cross-phase modulation (XPM) leads to opposite signs of differential
nonlinear phase shifts (NPSs) in these two cases, resulting in inverse
saturable absorption (ISA) during pulse formation process. The ISA is not
helpful for the self-starting of laser mode-locking and can be alleviated by
introducing a non-reciprocal phase shifter into the fiber loop. In addition, we
analyze the influences of gain-fiber position, splitting ratio, and optical
attenuator in the fiber loop, on the differential NPS and self-starting
process. These results are helpful for optimizing the design of NALM and
lowering the self-starting threshold of the high-repetition-rate mode-locked

heterogeneity analysis, which is directly concerned with outcome-feature
relationships, has led to a deeper understanding of disease biology. Such an
analysis identifies the underlying subgroup structure and estimates the
subgroup-specific regression coefficients. However, most of the existing
regression-based heterogeneity analyses can only address disjoint subgroups;
that is, each sample is assigned to only one subgroup. In reality, some samples
have multiple labels, for example, many genes have several biological
functions, and some cells of pure cell types transition into other types over
time, which suggest that their outcome-feature relationships (regression
coefficients) can be a mixture of relationships in more than one subgroups, and
as a result, the disjoint subgrouping results can be unsatisfactory. To this
end, we develop a novel approach to regression-based heterogeneity analysis,
which takes into account possible overlaps between subgroups and high data
dimensions. A subgroup membership vector is introduced for each sample, which
is combined with a loss function. Considering the lack of information arising
from small sample sizes, an $l_2$ norm penalty is developed for each membership
vector to encourage similarity in its elements. A sparse penalization is also
applied for regularized estimation and feature selection. Extensive simulations
demonstrate its superiority over direct competitors. The analysis of Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia data and lung cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
shows that the proposed approach can identify an overlapping subgroup structure
with favorable performance in prediction and stability.

real-world problems, such as distinguishing healthy and unhealthy objects in
biomedical diagnostics and defective and non-defective products in
manufacturing inspections. Nonetheless, fully annotated data are commonly
required to effectively solve this problem, and their collection by domain
experts is a tedious and expensive procedure. In contrast to BC, several
significant semi-supervised learning techniques that heavily rely on stochastic
data augmentation techniques have been devised for solving multi-class
classification. In this study, we demonstrate that the stochastic data
augmentation technique is less suitable for solving typical BC problems because
it can omit crucial features that strictly distinguish between positive and
negative samples. To address this issue, we propose a new learning
representation to solve the BC problem using a few labels with a random k-pair
cross-distance learning mechanism. First, by harnessing a few labeled samples,
the encoder network learns the projection of positive and negative samples in
angular spaces to maximize and minimize their inter-class and intra-class
distances, respectively. Second, the classifier learns to discriminate between
positive and negative samples using on-the-fly labels generated based on the
angular space and labeled samples to solve BC tasks. Extensive experiments were
conducted using four real-world publicly available BC datasets. With few labels
and without any data augmentation techniques, the proposed method outperformed
state-of-the-art semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods.
Moreover, with 10% labeling, our semi-supervised classifier could obtain
competitive accuracy compared with a fully supervised setting.

standard sirens: the gravitational wave (GW) analog of standard candles. The
upcoming space-borne GW detectors will be able to discover such systems and
estimate their luminosity distances precisely. Unfortunately, weak
gravitational lensing can induce significant errors in the measured distance of
these standard sirens at high redshift, severely limiting their usefulness as
precise distance probes. The uncertainty due to weak lensing can be reduced if
the lensing magnification of the siren can be estimated independently, a
procedure called 'delensing'. With the help of up-to-date numerical
simulations, here we investigate how much the weak-lensing errors can be
reduced using convergence maps reconstructed from shear measurements. We also
evaluate the impact of delensing on cosmological parameter estimation with
bright standard sirens. We find that the weak-lensing errors for sirens at $z_s
= 2.9$ can be reduced by about a factor of two on average, but to achieve this
would require expensive ultra-deep field observations for every siren. Such an
approach is likely to be practical in only limited cases, and the reduction in
the weak-lensing error is therefore likely to be insufficient to significantly
improve the cosmological parameter estimation. We conclude that performing
delensing corrections is unlikely to be worthwhile, in contrast to the more
positive expectations presented in previous studies. For delensing to become

  Sciences workshop submission",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fields in cosmology, such as the matter distribution, are observed by
experiments up to experimental noise. The first step in cosmological data
analysis is usually to de-noise the observed field using an analytic or
simulation driven prior. On large enough scales, such fields are Gaussian, and
the de-noising step is known as Wiener filtering. However, on smaller scales
probed by upcoming experiments, a Gaussian prior is substantially sub-optimal
because the true field distribution is very non-Gaussian. Using normalizing
flows, it is possible to learn the non-Gaussian prior from simulations (or from
more high-resolution observations), and use this knowledge to de-noise the data
more effectively. We show that we can train a flow to represent the matter
distribution of the universe, and evaluate how much signal-to-noise can be
gained as a function of the experimental noise under idealized conditions. We
also introduce a patching method to reconstruct fields on arbitrarily large
images by dividing them up into small maps (where we reconstruct non-Gaussian
features), and patching the small posterior maps together on large scales
(where the field is Gaussian).

imbalanced multi-modal data. LtCMH firstly adopts auto-encoders to mine the
individuality and commonality of different modalities by minimizing the
dependency between the individuality of respective modalities and by enhancing
the commonality of these modalities. Then it dynamically combines the
individuality and commonality with direct features extracted from respective
modalities to create meta features that enrich the representation of tail

outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-tail datasets and holds a better

music industry and provides a comparative advantage for those that do it well.
Considerable efforts were put into machine learning prediction models for that
purpose. It is known that in these models, relevant predictive parameters
include intrinsic lyrical and acoustic characteristics, extrinsic factors
(e.g., publisher influence and support), and the previous popularity of the
artists. Much less attention was given to the social components of the
spreading of song popularity. Recently, evidence for musical homophily - the
tendency that people who are socially linked also share musical tastes - was
reported. Here we determine how musical homophily can be used to predict song
popularity. The study is based on an extensive dataset from the last.fm online
music platform from which we can extract social links between listeners and
their listening patterns. To quantify the importance of networks in the
spreading of songs that eventually determines their popularity, we use musical
homophily to design a predictive influence parameter and show that its
inclusion in state-of-the-art machine learning models enhances predictions of
song popularity. The influence parameter improves the prediction precision
(TP/(TP+FN)) by about 50% from 0.14 to 0.21, indicating that the social
component in the spreading of music plays at least as significant a role as the
artist's popularity or the impact of the genre.

on the consumption speed of premixed lean methane-air laminar flames exposed to
combined strain and heat loss. Equivalence ratios of 0.9, 0.7, and 0.5 with
fuel mixture composition ranging from pure methane to pure hydrogen are
considered to cover a wide range of conditions in the lean region. The 1-D
asymmetric counter-flow premixed laminar flame aCFPF with heat loss on the
product side is considered as a flamelet configuration that represents an
elementary unit of a turbulent flame and the consumption speed is used to
characterize the effect of strain and heat loss. Due to the ambiguity in the
definition of the consumption speed of multi-component mixtures, two
definitions are compared. The definition of the consumption speed based on the
heat release results in lower values of the stretched flame speed and even an
opposite response to strain rate for some methane-hydrogen-air mixtures
compared to the definition based on the fuel consumption. Strain rate leads to
an increase in the flame speed for the lean methane-hydrogen mixtures, reaching
a maximum value after which the flame speed decreases with strain rate. Heat
loss decreases the stretched flame speed and leads to a sooner extinction of
the flamelet due to combined strain and heat loss. Hydrogen addition and
equivalence ratio significantly impact the maximum consumption speed and the
flame response to combined strain rate and heat loss. The effect of hydrogen on
the thermo-diffusive properties of the mixture, characterized by the Zel'dovich
number and the effective Lewis number, are also analyzed and related to the
effect on the consumption speed. Two definitions of the Lewis number of the
multi-component fuel mixture are evaluated against the results from the aCFPF.

system with any number of nodes, and hence proving their correctness becomes an
infinite state verification problem. The most popular approach for verifying
distributed protocols is to find an inductive invariant which is strong enough
to prove the required safety property. However, finding inductive invariants is
known to be notoriously hard, and is especially harder in the context of
distributed protocols which are quite complex due to their asynchronous nature.
In this work, we investigate an orthogonal cut-off based approach to verifying
distributed protocols which sidesteps the problem of finding an inductive
invariant, and instead reduces checking correctness to a finite state
verification problem. The main idea is to find a finite, fixed protocol
instance called the cutoff instance, such that if the cutoff instance is safe,
then any protocol instance would also be safe. Previous cutoff based approaches
have only been applied to a restricted class of protocols and specifications.
We formalize the cutoff approach in the context of a general protocol modeling
language (RML), and identify sufficient conditions which can be efficiently
encoded in SMT to check whether a given protocol instance is a cutoff instance.
Further, we propose a simple static analysis-based algorithm to automatically
synthesize a cut-off instance. We have applied our approach successfully on a
number of complex distributed protocols, providing the first known cut-off

meta-model which may fast adapt to novel classes with only a few exemplars and
meanwhile remain robust to adversarial attacks. The conventional solution for
robust MAML is to introduce robustness-promoting regularization during
meta-training stage. With such a regularization, previous robust MAML methods
simply follow the typical MAML practice that the number of training shots
should match with the number of test shots to achieve an optimal adaptation
performance. However, although the robustness can be largely improved, previous
methods sacrifice clean accuracy a lot. In this paper, we observe that
introducing robustness-promoting regularization into MAML reduces the intrinsic
dimension of clean sample features, which results in a lower capacity of clean
representations. This may explain why the clean accuracy of previous robust
MAML methods drops severely. Based on this observation, we propose a simple
strategy, i.e., increasing the number of training shots, to mitigate the loss
of intrinsic dimension caused by robustness-promoting regularization. Though
simple, our method remarkably improves the clean accuracy of MAML without much
loss of robustness, producing a robust yet accurate model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior arts in achieving a
better trade-off between accuracy and robustness. Besides, we observe that our
method is less sensitive to the number of fine-tuning steps during
meta-training, which allows for a reduced number of fine-tuning steps to
improve training efficiency.

ones out to ensure the model only needs to handle fundamental ST relations at
the beginning, before gradually moving to hard ones. Our strategy can be
applied to any canonical deep learning architecture without extra trainable
parameters, and extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets are conducted
to illustrate that, by controlling the difficulty level of ST relations as the
training progresses, the model is able to capture better representation of the
data and thus yields better generalization.

Continuous Episodic Control (CEC), a novel non-parametric episodic memory

orbital and spin degrees of freedom partially itinerant or localized depending

the observations of two of such features, the orbital selective Mott phase
(OSMP) and spin nematicity, evidenced in magnetization and magnetotransport
[resistivity, Hall effect, angular magnetoresistance (AMR)] of Ni-substituted
FeTe$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ single crystals. Two series of single crystals
Fe$_{1+{\delta}-y}$Ni$_y$Te$_{0.65}$Se$_{0.35}$ were prepared, with $0 < y <
0.2$, and $\delta$ either positive (S crystals) or negative (F crystals),
depending on the crystallization rate. The S crystals, with single, tetragonal
phase exhibit superconducting (SC) properties inferior to F crystals, which
contain Fe vacancy-rich monoclinic inclusions. Substitution of Ni dopes both
types of crystals with electrons, what eliminates some of the hole pockets from
Fermi level, leaving only one, originating from $d_{xy}$ orbital. We show that
electron-dominated transport, observed at low $T$ at large $y$, is replaced by
hole-dominated transport at $T > 180$ K, suggesting direct link with the
appearance of the $d_{z^2}$ hole pockets at X points of the Brillouin zone in
the OSMP phase, as recently reported by angular resolved photoemission
experiments (Commun. Phys. 5, 29 (2022)). The AMR of S crystals shows the $C_4$
rotational symmetry of in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy at small $y$,
replaced by $C_2$ symmetry at intermediate $y$, indicating development of Ni
doping-induced spin nematicity. The $C_4$ symmetry is preserved in F crystals
due to microstructural disorder related to vacancy-rich inclusions. The
tendency towards nematicity, induced by Ni doping, appears to be the most
important factor producing inferior superconducting properties of S crystals.

expansion dynamics is trimodal. We present three different time-scales of
expansion -- inner-core, outer-core and the whole cloud; whereas for

higher-body densities and correlations and observe the antibunching effect. The

the Pauli principle. With the expansion of bosons the correlation hole also

expansion dynamics of dipolar bosons is again trimodal as before, but the

paper, a novel metric learning is presented as a service methodology that
incorporates covariance to signify the direction of the linear relationship

our covariance-embedding-enhanced approach enables metric learning as a service
to be more expressive for computing similar or dissimilar measures and can
capture positive, negative, or neutral relationships. Extensive experiments
conducted using various benchmark datasets, including natural, biomedical, and

covariance-embedding optimizations can obtain higher-quality, more separable,

Lutetium source coupled with an HP-Ge spectrometer. Our approach uses a LYSO
crystal both as Lutetium source and as an active detector. Scintillation light
from the LYSO crystal is acquired in coincidence with the signals from the
HP-Ge detector, this allows a powerful suppression of the background sourcing
from the well known $\beta^-$ decay branch. This coincidence approach led to an
improvement on the $^{176}$Lu EC branching ratio limits by a factor 3 to 30,
depending on the considered EC channel.

with the highest $p_{\rm T}$ in the event ($p_{\rm T}^{\rm{ lead}} > 5$
GeV/$c$) is used as an approximation for the jet axis. The event is
consequently divided into three azimuthal regions and the jet signal is
obtained as the difference between the Toward region, that contains jet
fragmentation products in addition to the underlying event (UE), and the
Transverse region, which is dominated by the UE. The coalescence parameter in
the jet is found to be approximately a factor of 10 larger than that in the
underlying event. This experimental observation is consistent with the
coalescence picture and can be attributed to the smaller average phase-space
distance between nucleons inside the jet cone as compared to the underlying
event. The results presented in this Letter are compared to predictions from a
simple nucleon coalescence model, where the phase space distributions of
nucleons are generated using PYTHIA 8 with the Monash 2013 tuning, and to
predictions from a deuteron production model based on ordinary nuclear
reactions with parametrized energy-dependent cross sections tuned on data. The
latter model is implemented in PYTHIA 8.3. Both models reproduce the observed
large difference between in-jet and out-of-jet coalescence parameters

reinforcement learning tasks with sparse or absent extrinsic rewards. There
exist two technical challenges in implementing intrinsic motivation: 1) how to
design a proper intrinsic objective to facilitate efficient exploration; and 2)
how to combine the intrinsic objective with the extrinsic objective to help
find better solutions. In the current literature, the intrinsic objectives are
all designed in a task-agnostic manner and combined with the extrinsic
objective via simple addition (or used by itself for reward-free pre-training).
In this work, we show that these designs would fail in typical sparse-reward
continuous control tasks. To address the problem, we propose Constrained
Intrinsic Motivation (CIM) to leverage readily attainable task priors to
construct a constrained intrinsic objective, and at the same time, exploit the
Lagrangian method to adaptively balance the intrinsic and extrinsic objectives
via a simultaneous-maximization framework. We empirically show, on multiple
sparse-reward continuous control tasks, that our CIM approach achieves greatly
improved performance and sample efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.
Moreover, the key techniques of our CIM can also be plugged into existing

deals mainly with the stability of super-resolution and the diffraction limit
with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio. The goal is to determine the number,
locations, and amplitudes of point sources from noisy Fourier data. The first
contribution in this paper is two location-amplitude identities characterizing
the relations between source locations and amplitudes in the super-resolution
problem. These identities allow us to directly derive the super-resolution
capability for number, location, and amplitude recovery in the super-resolution
problem and improve state-of-the-art estimations to an unprecedented level to
have practical significance. The nonlinear inverse problems studied in this
paper are known to be very challenging and have only been partially solved in
recent years. However, thanks to this paper, we now have a clear and simple
picture of all of these problems. The second crucial result of this paper is
the theoretical proof of a two-point diffraction limit in spaces of general
dimensionality under only an assumption on the noise level. The two-point
diffraction limit is given by \[
  R = \frac{4\arcsin \left(\left(\frac{\sigma}{m_{\min}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\right)}{\Omega} \] for $\frac{\sigma}{m_{\min}}\leq\frac{1}{2}$, where
$\frac{\sigma}{m_{\min}}$ represents the inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio
($SNR$) and $\Omega$ is the cutoff frequency. This solves the long-standing
puzzle and debate about the diffraction limit for imaging (and line spectral
estimation) in general setting. Our results also show that, for the resolution
of any two point sources, when $SNR>2$, one can definitely exceed the Rayleigh
limit $\frac{\pi}{\Omega}$. We also find the optimal algorithm that achieves
the optimal resolution when distinguishing two sources.

particularly as such networks are being increasingly deployed in the biological

problem based on masking. Given an existing image-to-image network, our
approach computes a mask such that the distance between the masked
reconstructed image and the masked true image is guaranteed to be less than a
specified threshold, with high probability. The mask thus identifies the more
certain regions of the reconstructed image. Our approach is agnostic to the
underlying image-to-image network, and only requires triples of the input
(degraded), reconstructed and true images for training. Furthermore, our method
is agnostic to the distance metric used. As a result, one can use $L_p$-style
distances or perceptual distances like LPIPS, which contrasts with
interval-based approaches to uncertainty. Our theoretical guarantees derive
from a conformal calibration procedure. We evaluate our mask-based approach to
uncertainty on image colorization, image completion, and super-resolution
tasks, demonstrating high quality performance on each.

proposes a water monitoring system using autonomous surface vehicles, equipped
with water quality sensors, based on a multimodal particle swarm optimization,
and the federated learning technique, with Gaussian process as a surrogate
model, the AquaFeL-PSO algorithm. The proposed monitoring system has two
phases, the exploration phase and the exploitation phase. In the exploration
phase, the vehicles examine the surface of the water resource, and with the
data acquired by the water quality sensors, a first water quality model is
estimated in the central server. In the exploitation phase, the area is divided
into action zones using the model estimated in the exploration phase for a
better exploitation of the contamination zones. To obtain the final water
quality model of the water resource, the models obtained in both phases are
combined. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed path planner

improvement over the other path planners compared, and the entire water
resource, obtaining a 400$\%$ better model, as well as in detecting pollution
peaks, the improvement in this case study is 4,000$\%$. It was also proven that

and distributions of their carriers. Based on stacking thousands of spectra

dust grains, in a range of latitude spanning ${\sim}22^{\circ}$
($4^{\circ}\,{<}\,|b|\,{<}\,15^{\circ}$) toward the Galactic center
($|\ell|\,{<}\,11^{\circ}$). Tight linear intensity correlations can be found
between $\lambda$442.8, $\lambda$862.1, and dust grains for
$|b|\,{<}\,12^{\circ}$ or $E(B-V)\,{>}\,0.3$ mag. For $|b|\,{>}\,12^{\circ}$,
$\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 present larger relative strength with respect
to the dust grains. A systematic variation of the relative strength between
$\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 with $|b|$ and $E(B-V)$ concludes that the
two DIBs do not share a common carrier. Furthermore, the carrier of
$\lambda$862.1 is more abundant at high latitudes than that of $\lambda$442.8.
This work can be treated as an example showing the significance and potentials
to the DIB research covering a large latitude range.

association is widely accepted, as it appears in the most recent Fermi catalog,
it deserves to be revisited given the multi-wavelength evidences and the recent
discovery of variable X-ray sources in the Fermi source region. In particular,
low frequency radio maps from the Giant Metre Radio Telescope in Pune (India)
have been carefully inspected which, together with X-ray data re-analysis from
Chandra, lead us to get a deep insight into the candidates to be associated to
4FGL J1848.7-0129. This results in the discovery of a new X-ray variable point
source coincident with an unreported non-thermal radio emitter, both of them
well inside the 4FGL J1848.7-0129 error ellipse. We analyze and discuss all
these observational facts, and we propose now a newly discovered blazar
candidate as the most promising responsible for the gamma ray emission in the

millisecond pulsars in GLIMPSE-C01 or their gamma-ray emission properties.

present a general sequential transport model with different voltage drops at
quantum wells and barriers that includes noise and fluctuations due to the
superlattice epitaxial growth. Excitability and oscillations of the current in
superlattices with identical periods are due to nucleation and motion of charge
dipole waves that form at the emitter contact when the current drops below a
critical value. Insertion of wider wells increases superlattice excitability by
allowing wave nucleation at the modified wells and more complex dynamics. Then
hyperchaos and different types of intermittent chaos are possible on extended
dc voltage ranges. Intrinsic shot and thermal noises and external noises
produce minor effects on chaotic attractors. However, random disorder due to
growth fluctuations may suppress any regular or chaotic current oscillations.
Numerical simulations show that more than 70\% of samples remain chaotic when
the standard deviation of their fluctuations due to epitaxial growth is below
0.024 nm (10\% of a single monolayer) whereas for 0.015 nm disorder suppresses

  Substructure Learning","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, graph anomaly detection has attracted increasing attention in data
mining and machine learning communities. Apart from existing attribute
anomalies, graph anomaly detection also captures suspicious
topological-abnormal nodes that differ from the major counterparts. Although
massive graph-based detection approaches have been proposed, most of them focus
on node-level comparison while pay insufficient attention on the surrounding
topology structures. Nodes with more dissimilar neighborhood substructures have
more suspicious to be abnormal. To enhance the local substructure detection
ability, we propose a novel Graph Anomaly Detection framework via Multi-scale
Substructure Learning (GADMSL for abbreviation). Unlike previous algorithms, we
manage to capture anomalous substructures where the inner similarities are
relatively low in dense-connected regions. Specifically, we adopt a region
proposal module to find high-density substructures in the network as suspicious
regions. Their inner-node embedding similarities indicate the anomaly degree of
the detected substructures. Generally, a lower degree of embedding similarities
means a higher probability that the substructure contains topology anomalies.
To distill better embeddings of node attributes, we further introduce a graph
contrastive learning scheme, which observes attribute anomalies in the
meantime. In this way, GADMSL can detect both topology and attribute anomalies.
Ultimately, extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GADMSL
greatly improves detection performance (up to 7.30% AUC and 17.46% AUPRC gains)
compared to state-of-the-art attributed networks anomaly detection algorithms.

additional rules on top of the programming language. Each refinement rule
introduces a specific programming statement and developers cannot depart from
these rules to construct programs. CbC allows to develop software in a

CbC-Block and TraitCbC. Both approaches CbC-Block and TraitCbC, are related to
CbC, but they have new language constructs that enable a more flexible software

(FR) performance by providing additional information about sample quality.
Because FIQA methods attempt to estimate the utility of a sample for face
recognition, it is reasonable to assume that these methods are heavily
influenced by the underlying face recognition system. Although modern face
recognition systems are known to perform well, several studies have found that
such systems often exhibit problems with demographic bias. It is therefore
likely that such problems are also present with FIQA techniques. To investigate
the demographic biases associated with FIQA approaches, this paper presents a
comprehensive study involving a variety of quality assessment methods
(general-purpose image quality assessment, supervised face quality assessment,
and unsupervised face quality assessment methods) and three diverse
state-of-theart FR models. Our analysis on the Balanced Faces in the Wild (BFW)
dataset shows that all techniques considered are affected more by variations in
race than sex. While the general-purpose image quality assessment methods
appear to be less biased with respect to the two demographic factors
considered, the supervised and unsupervised face image quality assessment
methods both show strong bias with a tendency to favor white individuals (of
either sex). In addition, we found that methods that are less racially biased
perform worse overall. This suggests that the observed bias in FIQA methods is
to a significant extent related to the underlying face recognition system.

  Problem",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+) is an extension of the
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), where the search space is
smaller in solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However,
QAOA+ requires a trivial feasible solution as the initial state, so it cannot
be used for problems that are difficult to find a trivial feasible solution.
For simplicity, we call them as Non-Trivial-Feasible-Solution Problems (NTFSP).
In this paper, we take the Minimum Exact Cover (MEC) problem as an example,
studying how to apply QAOA+ to NTFSP. As we know, exact covering (EC) is the
feasible space of MEC problem, which has no trivial solutions. To overcome the
above problem, the EC problem is divided into two steps to solve. First,
disjoint sets are obtained, which is equivalent to solving independent sets.
Second, on this basis, the sets covering all elements (i.e., EC) are solved. In
other words, we transform MEC into a multi-objective constrained optimization
problem, where feasible space consists of independent sets that are easy to
find. Finally, we also verify the feasibility of the algorithm from numerical
experiments. Our method provides a feasible way for applying QAOA+ to NTFSP,
and is expected to expand its application significantly.

vast applications in many facets of technology. Some of the most popular
approaches to train segmentation networks employ loss functions optimizing
pixel-overlap, an objective that is insufficient for many segmentation tasks.
In recent years, their limitations fueled a growing interest in topology-aware
methods, which aim to recover the correct topology of the segmented structures.
However, so far, none of the existing approaches achieve a spatially correct
matching between the topological features of ground truth and prediction.
  In this work, we propose the first topologically and feature-wise accurate
metric and loss function for supervised image segmentation, which we term Betti
matching. We show how induced matchings guarantee the spatially correct
matching between barcodes in a segmentation setting. Furthermore, we propose an
efficient algorithm to compute the Betti matching of images. We show that the
Betti matching error is an interpretable metric to evaluate the topological
correctness of segmentations, which is more sensitive than the well-established
Betti number error. Moreover, the differentiability of the Betti matching loss
enables its use as a loss function. It improves the topological performance of
segmentation networks across six diverse datasets while preserving the
volumetric performance. Our code is available in

Tchebycheffian splines admit a representation in terms of basis functions,

Tchebycheffian splines with pieces belonging to null-spaces of

upgrades for the High Luminosity LHC, among which the tracking systems. This
paper reports on performance studies, illustrated by an electron trigger, using
a simplified pixel tracker. To achieve a real-time trigger (e.g. processing
HL-LHC collision events at 40 MHz), simple algorithms are developed for
reconstructing pixel-based tracks and track isolation, utilizing look-up tables
based on pixel detector information. Significant gains in electron trigger
performance are seen when pixel detector information is included. In
particular, a rate reduction up to a factor of 20 is obtained with a signal
selection efficiency of more than 95\% over the whole $\eta$ coverage of this
detector. Furthermore, it reconstructs p-p collision points in the beam axis
(z) direction, with a high precision of 20 $\mu$m resolution in the very
central region ($|\eta| < 0.8$), and, up to 380 $\mu$m in the forward region
(2.7 $< |\eta| <$ 3.0). This study as well as the results can easily be adapted
to the muon case and to the different tracking systems at LHC and other
machines beyond the HL-LHC. The feasibility of such a real-time processing of
the pixel information is mainly constrained by the Level-1 trigger latency of
the experiment. How this might be overcome by the Front-End ASIC design, new
processors and embedded Artificial Intelligence algorithms is briefly tackled

type B result of Pan and Zeng by enumerating permutations in $\mathfrak{B}_n$
with the above four statistics and the type B inversion number. We also obtain
a $q$-analogue of the generating function for the type B bivariate alternating
descent polynomials. We consider a similar five-variable polynomial in the type
D Coxeter groups as well and give their egf. Alternating descents for the type
D groups were previously also defined by Remmel, but our definition is slightly
different. As a by-product of our proofs, we get bivariate $q$-analogues of
Hyatt's recurrences for the type B and type D Eulerian polynomials. Further
corollaries of our results are some symmetry relations for these polynomials
and $q$-analogues of generating functions for snakes of types B and D.

operates at a critical state. To verify the criticality hypothesis in the
neuronal networks is challenging and the accumulating experimental and
theoretical results remain controversial at this point. Here we simulate how
visual information of a nature image is processed by the finite
Kinouchi-Copelli neuronal network, extracting the trends of the mutual
information (how sensible the neuronal network is), the dynamical range (how
sensitive the network responds to external stimuli) and the statistical
fluctuations (how criticality is defined in conventional statistical physics).
It is rather remarkable that the optimized state for visual recognition,
although close to, does not coincide with the critical state where the
statistical fluctuations reach the maximum. Different images and/or network
sizes of course lead to differences in details but the trend of the information
optimization remains the same. Our findings pave the first step to investigate
how the information processing is optimized in different neuronal networks and
suggest that the criticality hypothesis may not be necessary to explain why a
neuronal network can process information smartly.

Flow introduces per-instance routing in addition to leveraging per-client
personalization to improve accuracies at each client. Further, Flow is
stateless which makes it unnecessary for a client to retain its personalized
state across FL rounds. This makes Flow practical for large-scale FL settings

contributed to a great investment in phylogenetic analysis, in order to track
numerous diseases and conceive effective medication and treatments.
  Phylogenetic analysis requires large quantities of information to be analyzed
and processed for knowledge extraction, using suitable techniques and,
nowadays, specific software and algorithms, to deliver results as efficiently
and fast as possible. These algorithms and techniques are already provided by
several free and available frameworks and tools. Usually, the process of
phylogenetic analysis consists of several processing steps, which define a
pipeline. Some phylogenetic frameworks have available more than one processing
step, such as inferring phylogenetic trees, data integration, and
visualization, but due to the continuous growth in involved data amounts, each
step may last several hours or days.
  Scientific workflow systems may use high performance computing facilities, if
available, for processing large volumes of data, concurrently. But most of
these scientific workflow systems cannot be easily installed and configured,
are available as centralized services, and, usually, it is not easy to
integrate tools and processing steps available in phylogenetic frameworks.
  This paper summarizes the thesis document of the FLOWViZ framework, which
main goal is to provide a software integration framework between a phylogenetic
framework and a scientific workflow system. This framework makes it possible to
build a customized integration with much fewer lines of code, while providing
existing phylogenetic frameworks with workflow building and execution, to
manage the processing of great amounts of data.

determining the function and robustness of biological systems. Here the
evolution progresses through the change in genotype, whereas the selection is
based on the phenotype, and genotype-phenotype relation also evolves. Theory
for such phenotypic evolution remains poorly-developed, in contrast to
evolution under the fitness landscape determined by genotypes. Here we provide
statistical-physics formulation of this problem by introducing replicas for
genotype and phenotype. We apply it to an evolution model, in which phenotypes
are given by spin configurations; genotypes are interaction matrix for spins to
give the Hamiltonian, and the fitness depends only on the configuration of a
subset of spins called target. We describe the interplay between the genetic
variations and phenotypic variances by noise in this model by our new approach
that extends the replica theory for spin-glasses to include spin-replica for
phenotypes and coupling-replica for genotypes. Within this framework we obtain
a phase diagram of the evolved phenotypes against the noise and selection
pressure, where each phase is distinguished by the fitness and overlaps for
genotypes and phenotypes. Among the phases, robust fitted phase, relevant to
biological evolution, is achieved under the intermediate level of noise
(temperature), where robustness to noise and to genetic mutation are
correlated, as a result of replica symmetry. We also find a trade-off between
maintaining a high fitness level of phenotype and acquiring a robust pattern of
genes as well as the dependence of this trade-off on the ratio between the size
of the functional (target) part to that of the remaining non-functional
(non-target) one. The selection pressure needed to achieve high fitness
increases with the fraction of target spins.

representing the hot component of the circumgalactic medium (CGM).
Time-dependent saturated thermal conduction and its implications like
condensation rates and mixing efficiency are assessed in multiphase clouds. Our
simulations are carried out by using the adaptive mesh refinement code Flash.
We perform a grid of models of which we present here those characteristic for
the presented study. The model clouds are initially in both hydrostatic and
thermal equilibrium and are in pressure balance with the HIM. Thus, they have
steep gradients in both temperature and density at the interface to HIM leading
to non-negligible thermal conduction. Several physical processes are considered
numerically or semi-analytically: thermal conduction, radiative cooling and
external heating of gas, self-gravity, mass diffusion, and dissociation of
molecules and ionization of atoms. It turns out that saturated thermal
conduction triggers a continuous condensation irrespective of cloud mass.
Dynamical interactions with ambient HIM all relate to the radial density
gradient in the clouds: (1) mass flux due to condensation is the higher the
more homogeneous the clouds are; (2) mixing of condensed gas with cloud gas is
easier in low-mass clouds, because of their shallower radial density gradient;
thus (3) accreted gas is distributed more efficiently. A distinct and
sub-structured transition zone forms at the interface between cloud and HIM,
which starts at smaller radii and is much narrower as deduced from analytical
theory.

enabling high UE data rates but also leading to a system not operating at its

density regime in which the network makes use of its full capability. The UE
density $K$ approximately equal to $\frac{LM}{2}$ is the range in which the
system reaches the largest sum throughput. In addition, there is a significant
fraction of UEs with relatively low throughput, when serving $K>\frac{LM}{2}$
UEs simultaneously. We propose to reduce the number of active UEs per time
slot, such that the system does not operate at ``full load'', and impose
throughput fairness among all users via a scheduler designed to maximize a
suitably defined concave componentwise non-decreasing network utility function.
Our numerical simulations show that we can tune the system such that a desired

characterize extrinsic catenaries in terms of their curvature and also as a

design perspectives. For example, the nonlinearity and coupling of fluid flows
and energy transports prevent direct applications of gradient type algorithms
in practice. In this paper, we propose an efficient numerical method to solve
this problem based on the operator splitting and optimization techniques. In

that the Boussinesq equations are decomposed into some easier linear equations

Consequently, at each iteration, four easy linear advection-diffusion equations

for computing a gradient. Then, we apply the Bercovier-Pironneau finite element
method for space discretization, and design a BFGS type algorithm for solving
the fully discretized optimal control problem. We look into the structure of
the problem, and design a meticulous strategy to seek step sizes for the BFGS
efficiently. Efficiency of the numerical approach is promisingly validated by
the results of some preliminary numerical experiments.

size we can even push its convergence order beyond quadratic to $1+\sqrt{2}

that were associated with flares of class $\geq$C6.0 and investigated the

content images. Despite the recent rapid progress, existing AST methods are
either incapable or too slow to run at ultra-resolutions (e.g., 4K) with
limited resources, which heavily hinders their further applications. In this
paper, we tackle this dilemma by learning a straightforward and lightweight
model, dubbed MicroAST. The key insight is to completely abandon the use of
cumbersome pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (e.g., VGG) at
inference. Instead, we design two micro encoders (content and style encoders)
and one micro decoder for style transfer. The content encoder aims at
extracting the main structure of the content image. The style encoder, coupled
with a modulator, encodes the style image into learnable dual-modulation
signals that modulate both intermediate features and convolutional filters of
the decoder, thus injecting more sophisticated and flexible style signals to
guide the stylizations. In addition, to boost the ability of the style encoder
to extract more distinct and representative style signals, we also introduce a
new style signal contrastive loss in our model. Compared to the state of the
art, our MicroAST not only produces visually superior results but also is 5-73
times smaller and 6-18 times faster, for the first time enabling super-fast
(about 0.5 seconds) AST at 4K ultra-resolutions. Code is available at

ranking for image retrieval as binary ranking relation classification. In
comparison to image classification, ranking relation classification is sample
efficient and domain agnostic. Besides, it provides a new perspective on
few-shot learning and is complementary to state-of-the-art methods. The core
component of our deep neural network is a simple MLP, which takes as input an
image triplet encoded as the difference between two vector-Kronecker products,
and outputs a binary relevance ranking order. The proposed RankMLP can be built
on top of any state-of-the-art feature extractors, and our entire deep neural
network is called the ranking deep neural network, or RankDNN. Meanwhile,
RankDNN can be flexibly fused with other post-processing methods. During the
meta test, RankDNN ranks support images according to their similarity with the
query samples, and each query sample is assigned the class label of its nearest
neighbor. Experiments demonstrate that RankDNN can effectively improve the
performance of its baselines based on a variety of backbones and it outperforms
previous state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple few-shot learning benchmarks,
including miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, Caltech-UCSD Birds, and CIFAR-FS.
Furthermore, experiments on the cross-domain challenge demonstrate the superior

facilities, is one of the most promising PeVatron candidates. This SNR has a
cometary shape which can be divided into a head and a tail region with
different physical conditions. However, it is not identified in which region
the 100 TeV emission is produced due to the limited position accuracy and/or
angular resolution of existing observational data. Additionally, it remains
unclear whether the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission is leptonic or
hadronic. With the better angular resolution provided by these new MAGIC data
compared to earlier $\gamma$-ray datasets, we aim to reveal the acceleration
site of PeV particles and the emission mechanism by resolving the SNR
G106.3+2.7 with 0.1$^\circ$ resolution at TeV energies. We detected extended
$\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with the radio continuum emission at
the head and tail of SNR G106.3+2.7. The fact that we detected a significant
$\gamma$-ray emission with energies above 6.0 TeV from the tail region only
suggests that the emissions above 10 TeV, detected with air shower experiments
(Milagro, HAWC, Tibet AS$\gamma$ and LHAASO), are emitted only from the SNR
tail. Under this assumption, the multi-wavelength spectrum of the head region
can be explained with either hadronic or leptonic models, while the leptonic
model for the tail region is in contradiction with the emission above 10 TeV
and X-rays. In contrast, the hadronic model could reproduce the observed
spectrum at the tail by assuming a proton spectrum with a cutoff energy of
$\sim 1$ PeV for the tail region. Such a high energy emission in this
middle-aged SNR (4--10 kyr) can be explained by considering the scenario that
protons escaping from the SNR in the past interact with surrounding dense gases
at present.

  https://github.com/peltona/rsp_model",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Remote SIM provisioning (RSP) for consumer devices is the protocol specified
by the GSM Association for downloading SIM profiles into a secure element in a
mobile device. The process is commonly known as eSIM, and it is expected to
replace removable SIM cards. The security of the protocol is critical because
the profile includes the credentials with which the mobile device will
authenticate to the mobile network. In this paper, we present a formal security
analysis of the consumer RSP protocol. We model the multi-party protocol in
applied pi calculus, define formal security goals, and verify them in ProVerif.
The analysis shows that the consumer RSP protocol protects against a network
adversary when all the intended participants are honest. However, we also model
the protocol in realistic partial compromise scenarios where the adversary
controls a legitimate participant or communication channel. The security
failures in the partial compromise scenarios reveal weaknesses in the protocol
design. The most important observation is that the security of RSP depends
unnecessarily on it being encapsulated in a TLS tunnel. Also, the lack of
pre-established identifiers means that a compromised download server anywhere
in the world or a compromised secure element can be used for attacks against
RSP between honest participants. Additionally, the lack of reliable methods for
verifying user intent can lead to serious security failures. Based on the
findings, we recommend practical improvements to RSP implementations, to future
versions of the specification, and to mobile operator processes to increase the
robustness of eSIM security.

such as personalized recommendation and Web-based chatbots. A critical
challenge to build PKBs is extracting personal attribute knowledge from users'
conversation data. Given some users of a conversational system, a personal
attribute and these users' utterances, our goal is to predict the ranking of
the given personal attribute values for each user. Previous studies often rely
on a relative number of resources such as labeled utterances and external data,
yet the attribute knowledge embedded in unlabeled utterances is underutilized
and their performance of predicting some difficult personal attributes is still
unsatisfactory. In addition, it is found that some text classification methods
could be employed to resolve this task directly. However, they also perform not
well over those difficult personal attributes. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework PEARL to predict personal attributes from conversations by
leveraging the abundant personal attribute knowledge from utterances under a
low-resource setting in which no labeled utterances or external data are
utilized. PEARL combines the biterm semantic information with the word
co-occurrence information seamlessly via employing the updated prior attribute
knowledge to refine the biterm topic model's Gibbs sampling process in an
iterative manner. The extensive experimental results show that PEARL
outperforms all the baseline methods not only on the task of personal attribute
prediction from conversations over two data sets, but also on the more general
weakly supervised text classification task over one data set.

and automatic report generation can play an important role in intra-operative

However, domain shifts between different surgeries with inter and intra-patient
variation and novel instruments' appearance degrade the performance of model
prediction. Moreover, it requires output from multiple models, which can be
computationally expensive and affect real-time performance.
  Methodology: A multi-task learning (MTL) model is proposed for surgical
report generation and tool-tissue interaction prediction that deals with domain
shift problems. The model forms of shared feature extractor, mesh-transformer
branch for captioning and graph attention branch for tool-tissue interaction
prediction. The shared feature extractor employs class incremental contrastive
learning (CICL) to tackle intensity shift and novel class appearance in the
target domain. We design Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) based curriculum learning
into both shared and task-specific branches to enhance model learning. We
incorporate a task-aware asynchronous MTL optimization technique to fine-tune
the shared weights and converge both tasks optimally.
  Results: The proposed MTL model trained using task-aware optimization and
fine-tuning techniques reported a balanced performance (BLEU score of 0.4049
for scene captioning and accuracy of 0.3508 for interaction detection) for both
tasks on the target domain and performed on-par with single-task models in
domain adaptation.
  Conclusion: The proposed multi-task model was able to adapt to domain shifts,
incorporate novel instruments in the target domain, and perform tool-tissue
interaction detection and report generation on par with single-task models.

one of the outstanding topics in solar physics. Recent X-ray and radio imaging

primarily accelerated in the loop-top and likely experience trapping and/or
scattering effects. By combining the focused particle transport equation with
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of solar flares, we present a macroscopic
particle model that naturally incorporates electron acceleration and transport.
Our simulation results indicate that the physical processes such as turbulent
pitch-angle scattering can have important impacts on both electron acceleration
in the loop-top and transport in the flare loop, and their influences are
highly energy dependent. A spatial-dependent turbulent scattering with
enhancement in the loop-top can enable both efficient electron acceleration to
high energies and transport of abundant electrons to the footpoints. We further
generate spatially resolved synthetic hard X-ray (HXR) emission images and
spectra, revealing both the loop-top and footpoint HXR sources. Similar to the
observations, we show that the footpoint HXR sources are brighter and harder
than the loop-top HXR source. We suggest that the macroscopic particle model

landscape, building accurate models to forecast is a challenging endeavor. Due
to their high prevalence in many complex systems, S-curves are a popular
forecasting approach in previous work. However, their forecasting performance
has not been directly compared to other technology forecasting approaches.
Additionally, recent developments in time series forecasting that claim to
improve forecasting accuracy are yet to be applied to technological development
data. This work addresses both research gaps by comparing the forecasting
performance of S-curves to a baseline and by developing an autencoder approach
that employs recent advances in machine learning and time series forecasting.
S-curves forecasts largely exhibit a mean average percentage error (MAPE)
comparable to a simple ARIMA baseline. However, for a minority of emerging
technologies, the MAPE increases by two magnitudes. Our autoencoder approach
improves the MAPE by 13.5% on average over the second-best result. It forecasts
established technologies with the same accuracy as the other approaches.
However, it is especially strong at forecasting emerging technologies with a
mean MAPE 18% lower than the next best result. Our results imply that a simple
ARIMA model is preferable over the S-curve for technology forecasting.
Practitioners looking for more accurate forecasts should opt for the presented

randomly initialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can match the
performance of the fully trained dense networks at initialization, without any
optimization of the weights of the network (i.e., untrained networks). However,
the presence of such untrained subnetworks in graph neural networks (GNNs)
still remains mysterious. In this paper we carry out the first-of-its-kind
exploration of discovering matching untrained GNNs. With sparsity as the core
tool, we can find \textit{untrained sparse subnetworks} at the initialization,
that can match the performance of \textit{fully trained dense} GNNs. Besides
this already encouraging finding of comparable performance, we show that the
found untrained subnetworks can substantially mitigate the GNN over-smoothing
problem, hence becoming a powerful tool to enable deeper GNNs without bells and
whistles. We also observe that such sparse untrained subnetworks have appealing
performance in out-of-distribution detection and robustness of input
perturbations. We evaluate our method across widely-used GNN architectures on
various popular datasets including the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).

where large volumes of user feedback on items are available, the generation of
automatic recommendations in data-sparse domains, like insurance purchasing, is
an open problem. The insurance domain is notoriously data-sparse because the
number of products is typically low (compared to retail) and they are usually
purchased to last for a long time. Also, many users still prefer the telephone
over the web for purchasing products, reducing the amount of web-logged user
interactions. To address this, we present a recurrent neural network
recommendation model that uses past user sessions as signals for learning
recommendations. Learning from past user sessions allows dealing with the data
scarcity of the insurance domain. Specifically, our model learns from several
types of user actions that are not always associated with items, and unlike all
prior session-based recommendation models, it models relationships between
input sessions and a target action (purchasing insurance) that does not take
place within the input sessions. Evaluation on a real-world dataset from the
insurance domain (ca. 44K users, 16 items, 54K purchases, and 117K sessions)
against several state-of-the-art baselines shows that our model outperforms the
baselines notably. Ablation analysis shows that this is mainly due to the
learning of dependencies across sessions in our model. We contribute the first

to recover the missing pixels. Most previous works mask patches of the image
randomly, which underutilizes the semantic information that is beneficial to
visual representation learning. On the other hand, due to the large size of the

for an overdamped Brownian particle in a confining potential $V(x)$. We assume
that the position of the particle is reset at a constant rate to a random
location $x$, drawn from a distribution $p_R(x)$. To investigate the
thermodynamic cost of resetting, we study the stochastic entropy production
$S_{\rm Total}$. We derive a general expression for the average entropy
production for any $V(x)$, and the full distribution $P(S_{\rm Total}|t)$ of
the entropy production for $V(x)=0$. At late times, we show that this

  Metric-Adversarial Training","12 pages, 5 figures, Journal",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Specific emitter identification (SEI) plays an increasingly crucial and
potential role in both military and civilian scenarios. It refers to a process
to discriminate individual emitters from each other by analyzing extracted
characteristics from given radio signals. Deep learning (DL) and deep neural
networks (DNNs) can learn the hidden features of data and build the classifier
automatically for decision making, which have been widely used in the SEI
research. Considering the insufficiently labeled training samples and large
unlabeled training samples, semi-supervised learning-based SEI (SS-SEI) methods
have been proposed. However, there are few SS-SEI methods focusing on
extracting the discriminative and generalized semantic features of radio
signals. In this paper, we propose an SS-SEI method using metric-adversarial
training (MAT). Specifically, pseudo labels are innovatively introduced into
metric learning to enable semi-supervised metric learning (SSML), and an
objective function alternatively regularized by SSML and virtual adversarial
training (VAT) is designed to extract discriminative and generalized semantic
features of radio signals. The proposed MAT-based SS-SEI method is evaluated on
an open-source large-scale real-world automatic-dependent
surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) dataset and WiFi dataset and is compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results show that the proposed method
achieves better identification performance than existing state-of-the-art
methods. Specifically, when the ratio of the number of labeled training samples
to the number of all training samples is 10\%, the identification accuracy is
84.80\% under the ADS-B dataset and 80.70\% under the WiFi dataset. Our code

appears in the disconnected fermion loop contribution to an observable. As
simulation methods get more and more precise, these contributions become
increasingly important. Hence, we consider here the problem of computing the
trace $\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$, with $D$ the Dirac operator. The Hutchinson
method, which is very frequently used to stochastically estimate the trace of a
function of a matrix, approximates the trace as the average over estimates of
the form $x^{H} D^{-1} x$, with the entries of the vector $x$ following a
certain probability distribution. For $N$ samples, the accuracy is
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$. In recent work, we have introduced multigrid
multilevel Monte Carlo: having a multigrid hierarchy with operators $D_{\ell}$,
$P_{\ell}$ and $R_{\ell}$, for level $\ell$, we can rewrite the trace
$\mathrm{tr}(D^{-1})$ via a telescopic sum with difference-levels, written in
terms of the aforementioned operators and with a reduced variance. We have seen
significant reductions in the variance and the total work with respect to
exactly deflated Hutchinson. In this work, we explore the use of exact
deflation in combination with the multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo method, and
demonstrate how this leads to both algorithmic and computational gains.

chains, we consider two representative ways of linking them, the dot-type and
triangle-type links. Then, we construct a variety of superstructures, such as
the square, rectangular, and honeycomb network superstructures with dot-type
links and the honeycomb superstructure with triangle-type links. These links
provide the wavefunctions with an opportunity to have destructive interference,
which stabilizes the compact localized state(CLS). The CLS is a localized
eigenstate whose amplitudes are finite only inside a finite region and
guarantees the existence of a flat band. In the network superstructures, there
exist multiple flat bands proportional to the number of atoms of each chain,
and the corresponding eigenenergies can be found from the stability condition
of the compact localized state. Finally, we demonstrate that the finite
bandwidth of the nearly flat bands of the network superstructures arising from
the next-nearest-neighbor hopping processes can be suppressed by increasing the
length of the chains consisting of the superstructures.

nuclear motion introduces a decoherence that eventually traps the charge and a
crucial question in the field of attochemistry is how long the electronic

  activation ""spreading""",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  MP-PCA denoising has become the method of choice for denoising in MRI since
it provides an objective threshold to separate the desired signal from unwanted
thermal noise components. In rodents, thermal noise in the coils is an
important source of noise that can reduce the accuracy of activation mapping in
fMRI. Further confounding this problem, vendor data often contains zero-filling
and other effects that may violate MP-PCA assumptions. Here, we develop an
approach to denoise vendor data and assess activation ""spreading"" caused by
MP-PCA denoising in rodent task-based fMRI data. Data was obtained from N = 3
mice using conventional multislice and ultrafast acquisitions (1 s and 50 ms
temporal resolution, respectively), during visual stimulation. MP-PCA denoising
produced SNR gains of 64% and 39% and Fourier spectral amplitude (FSA)
increases in BOLD maps of 9% and 7% for multislice and ultrafast data,
respectively, when using a small [2 2] denoising window. Larger windows
provided higher SNR and FSA gains with increased spatial extent of activation
that may or may not represent real activation. Simulations showed that MP-PCA
denoising causes activation ""spreading"" with an increase in false positive rate
and smoother functional maps due to local ""bleeding"" of principal components,
and that the optimal denoising window for improved specificity of functional
mapping, based on Dice score calculations, depends on the data's tSNR and
functional CNR. This ""spreading"" effect applies also to another recently
proposed low-rank denoising method (NORDIC). Our results bode well for
dramatically enhancing spatial and/or temporal resolution in future fMRI work,
while taking into account the sensitivity/specificity trade-offs of low-rank
denoising methods.

$\mathrm{M_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$. The SILCC project simulation framework accounts
for non-equilibrium thermal and chemical processes in the warm and cold ISM.
The sink-based star formation and feedback model includes stellar winds,
hydrogen-ionising UV radiation, core-collapse supernovae, and cosmic ray (CR)
injection and diffusion. The simulations follow the observed relation between
$\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$ and the star formation rate surface density
$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$. CRs qualitatively change the outflow phase structure.
Without CRs, the outflows transition from a two-phase (warm and hot at 1 kpc)
to a single-phase (hot at 2 kpc) structure. With CRs, the outflow always has
three phases (cold, warm, and hot), dominated in mass by the warm phase. The
impact of CRs on mass loading decreases for higher $\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$ and
the mass loading factors of the CR-supported outflows are of order unity
independent of $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$. Similar to observations, vertical
velocity dispersions of the warm ionised medium (WIM) and the cold neutral
medium (CNM) correlate with the star formation rate as $\sigma_\mathrm{z}
\propto \Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}^a$, with $a \sim 0.20$. In the absence of stellar
feedback, we find no correlation. The velocity dispersion of the WIM is a
factor $\sim 2.2$ higher than that of the CNM, in agreement with local
observations. For $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR} \gtrsim 1.5 \times

between a surface layer and the atmosphere. The evolution equations of the
surface temperature and the atmospheric temperature are coupled by the emission
of infrared radiation by one level, that emission being captured by the other
layer, and the effect of all non radiative vertical exchanges of energy.
Therefore, an essential parameter is the absorptivity of the atmosphere,
denoted $\epsilon_a$. The value of $\epsilon_a$ depends critically on
greenhouse gases: increasing concentrations of $CO_2$ and $CH_4$ lead to a more
opaque atmosphere with higher values of $\epsilon_a$.
  First we prove that global existence of solutions of the system holds if and
only if $\epsilon_a \in (0, 2)$, and blow up in finite time occurs if
$\epsilon_a > 2$. (Note that the physical range of values for $\epsilon_a$ is
$(0, 1]$.) Next, we explain the long time dynamics for $\epsilon_a \in (0, 2)$,
and we prove that all solutions converge to some equilibrium point.
  Finally, motivated by the physical context, we study the dependence of the
equilibrium points with respect to the involved parameters, and we prove in
particular that the surface temperature grows as $\epsilon_a$ grows. This is
the key mathematical manifestation of the greenhouse effect.

the first time. We reached median detection limits of L =15.4 mag at 2.0

forming companions. We can constrain the occurrence of forming planets with

However, these one-size-fits-all models are typically optimized for average

context-dependent models. We extend Bridge-Mode Connectivity (BMC) (Garipov et

necessary to achieve MMF-to-SMF coupling efficiencies from 30\% to 70\% for
MMF's with core diameters up to 200 microns. We show how the obtained coupling
efficiency can be recovered if the output field of the MMF changes entirely,
e.g. through strong deformation of the fiber, by simple monitoring of the
field. Furthermore, we test the influence of the resolution of both essential
devices (field reconstruction and MPLC) on coupling efficiencies. We find that
commercially available devices with increased speed and efficiency, such as
wavefront sensors and deformable mirrors, are sufficient for establishing an
MMF to SMF interface which auto-corrects any decoupling in the kHz regime.

efficient model-based deep learning algorithms for estimating the near-field
wireless channel of XL-MIMO communications. In particular, we first formulate
the XL-MIMO near-field channel estimation task as a compressed sensing problem
using the spatial gridding-based sparsifying dictionary, and then solve the
resulting problem by applying the Learning Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding
Algorithm (LISTA). Due to the near-field characteristic, the spatial
gridding-based sparsifying dictionary may result in low channel estimation
accuracy and a heavy computational burden. To address this issue, we further
propose a new sparsifying dictionary learning-LISTA (SDL-LISTA) algorithm that
formulates the sparsifying dictionary as a neural network layer and embeds it

crucial information concerning the stochastic process. For a L\'evy process,
one obtains the characteristic exponent while the symbol of a (rich) Feller
process coincides with the classical symbol which is well known from the theory
of pseudodifferential operators. Leaving these classes behind, the most general
class of processes for which the symbol still exists are L\'evy-type processes.
It has been an open question, whether further generalizations are possible
within the framework of Markov processes. We answer this question in the
present article: within the class of Hunt semimartingales, L\'evy-type
processes are exactly those for which the probabilistic symbol exists. Leaving
quasi-continuity behind, one can construct processes admitting a symbol.

non-zero in two different regimes: (i) for $x=O(1)$ where the system reaches a
non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) (ii) for $x \sim t$, i.e., the ray-regime.
For a repulsive impurity these correlations are independent of ${\sf

  We present fragment-history volumes (FHV), a rendering technique based on a
sparse, discretized representation of a 3d scene that emerges from recording
all fragments that pass the rasterization stage in the graphics pipeline. These
fragments are stored into per-pixel or per-octant lists for further processing;
essentially creating an A-buffer. FHVs using per-octant fragment lists are view
independent and allow fast resampling for image generation as well as for using
more sophisticated approaches to evaluate material and lighting properties,
eventually enabling global-illumination evaluation in the standard graphics
pipeline available on current hardware.
  We show how FHVs are stored on the GPU in several ways, how they are created,

instead only with the number of logical operations. Each logical operation has
an associated active volume, such that the cost of a quantum computation can be

potential of improving patient outcomes while reducing negative side effects.
Learning individualized treatment rules (ITRs) often requires aggregation of
multiple datasets(sites); however, current ITR methodology does not take
between-site heterogeneity into account, which can hurt model generalizability
when deploying back to each site. To address this problem, we develop a method
for individual-level meta-analysis of ITRs, which jointly learns site-specific
ITRs while borrowing information about feature sign-coherency via a
scientifically-motivated directionality principle. We also develop an adaptive
procedure for model tuning, using information criteria tailored to the ITR
learning problem. We study the proposed methods through numerical experiments
to understand their performance under different levels of between-site
heterogeneity and apply the methodology to estimate ITRs in a large
multi-center database of electronic health records. This work extends several
popular methodologies for estimating ITRs (A-learning, weighted learning) to
the multiple-sites setting.

pattern discovery. In particular, the proposed model allows one to characterize
nonstationarity and time-varying system behaviors underlying spatiotemporal
data. To evaluate the proposed model, extensive experiments are conducted on
various spatiotemporal data representing different nonlinear dynamical systems,
including fluid dynamics, sea surface temperature, USA surface temperature, and
NYC taxi trips. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling
spatiotemporal data and characterizing spatial/temporal patterns with the
proposed model. In the spatial context, the spatial patterns can be
automatically extracted and intuitively characterized by the spatial modes. In
the temporal context, the complex time-varying system behaviors can be revealed
by the temporal modes in the proposed model. Thus, our model lays an insightful
foundation for understanding complex spatiotemporal data in real-world

achieved remarkable success, which is mainly due to the large amount of
available annotation data. However, obtaining these annotated data has to
afford expensive costs in reality. Therefore, a more realistic strategy is to
leverage semi-supervised learning (SSL) with a small amount of labeled data and
a large amount of unlabeled data. Typically, semantic consistency
regularization and the two-stage learning methods of decoupling feature
extraction and classification have been proven effective. Nevertheless,
representation learning only limited to semantic consistency regularization may
not guarantee the separation or discriminability of representations of samples
with different semantics; due to the inherent limitations of the two-stage
learning methods, the extracted features may not match the specific downstream
tasks. In order to deal with the above drawbacks, this paper proposes an
end-to-end deep semi-supervised learning double contrast of semantic and
feature, which extracts effective tasks specific discriminative features by
contrasting the semantics/features of positive and negative augmented samples
pairs. Moreover, we leverage information theory to explain the rationality of
double contrast of semantics and features and slack mutual information to
contrastive loss in a simpler way. Finally, the effectiveness of our method is
verified in benchmark datasets.

vision-specific contrastive loss, and a cross-modal contrastive loss. The
implicit knowledge distillation is designed to transfer the fine-grained

NRBdoor is natural and imperceptible, since rotation is a common operation

surface from un-posed multi-view images and rely on a neural implicit surface
representation that captures both the geometry and the appearance of the
object. By contrast with most NeRF-based methods, we do not assume that the
camera-object relative poses are known and instead simultaneously optimize both
the object shape and the pose trajectory. As global optimization over all the
shape and pose parameters is prone to fail without coarse-level initialization
of the poses, we propose an incremental approach which starts by splitting the
sequence into carefully selected overlapping segments within which the
optimization is likely to succeed. We incrementally reconstruct the object
shape and track the object poses independently within each segment, and later
merge all the segments by aligning poses estimated at the overlapping frames.
Finally, we perform a global optimization over all the aligned segments to
achieve full reconstruction. We experimentally show that the proposed method is
able to reconstruct the shape and color of both textured and challenging
texture-less objects, outperforms classical methods that rely only on
appearance features, and its performance is close to recent methods that assume
known camera poses.

chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, following well-established
modeling procedures documented in the literature. The model generates a
sequence of tumor images, from which time series of two biomarkers: entropy and
fractal dimension, is obtained. Our model shows that the fractal dimension
increased faster at the onset of cancer cell dissemination, while entropy was
more responsive to changes induced in the tumor by the different therapy
modalities. These observations suggest that the predictive value of the
proposed biomarkers could vary considerably with time. Thus, it is important to
assess their use at different stages of cancer and for different imaging
modalities. Another observation derived from the results was that both
biomarkers varied slowly when the applied therapy attacked cancer cells in a
scattered fashion along the automatons' area, leaving multiple independent
clusters of cells at the end of the treatment. Thus, patterns of change of

develop a robust nonparametric integrative analysis approach to identify

adopting the Cauchy loss function, and a nonparametric model is built to

multiple subgroups, and different subgroups have distinct sets of important
genes. It is hence imperative to discover the latent subgroups and reveal the
subgroup-specific important genes. Some heterogeneity analysis methods have
been proposed in recent literature. Despite considerable successes, most of the
existing studies are still limited as they cannot accommodate data
contamination and ignore the interconnections among genes. Aiming at these
shortages, we develop a robust structured heterogeneity analysis approach to
identify subgroups, select important genes as well as estimate their effects on
the phenotype of interest. Possible data contamination is accommodated by
employing the Huber loss function. A sparse overlapping group lasso penalty is
imposed to conduct regularization estimation and gene identification, while
taking into account the possibly overlapping cluster structure of genes. This
approach takes an iterative strategy in the similar spirit of K-means

$\boldsymbol{T}\!\!=\!\!\boldsymbol{R}\boldsymbol{Q}^T \!\!
\boldsymbol{\Lambda} \boldsymbol{Q}$, followed by an individual interpolation
of the two rotation tensors $\boldsymbol{R}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ and the
positive definite diagonal eigenvalue tensor $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ resulting
from this decomposition. Two different schemes are considered for a consistent
rotation interpolation within the special orthogonal group $\mathbb{SO}(3)$,
either based on relative rotation vectors or quaternions. For eigenvalue
interpolation, three different schemes, either based on the logarithmic
weighted average, moving least squares or logarithmic moving least squares, are
considered. It is demonstrated that the proposed interpolation procedure
preserves the structure of a tensor, i.e., $\boldsymbol{R}$ and
$\boldsymbol{Q}$ remain orthogonal tensors and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ remains a
positive definite diagonal tensor during interpolation, as well as scaling and
rotational invariance (objectivity). Based on selected numerical examples
considering the interpolation of either symmetric or non-symmetric tensors, the
proposed schemes are compared to existing approaches such as Euclidean,
Log-Euclidean, Cholesky and Log-Cholesky interpolation. In contrast to these
existing methods, the proposed interpolation schemes result in smooth and
monotonic evolutions of tensor invariants such as determinant, trace,
fractional anisotropy (FA), and Hilbert's anisotropy (HA)...{continued see pdf}

computational cost has been a long-standing flaw for diffusion probabilistic
models (DPMs), which, in turn, greatly limits their applications on
resource-limited platforms. Prior methods towards efficient DPM, however, have
largely focused on accelerating the testing yet overlooked their huge
complexity and sizes. In this paper, we make a dedicated attempt to lighten DPM
while striving to preserve its favourable performance. We start by training a
small-sized latent diffusion model (LDM) from scratch, but observe a
significant fidelity drop in the synthetic images. Through a thorough
assessment, we find that DPM is intrinsically biased against high-frequency
generation, and learns to recover different frequency components at different
time-steps. These properties make compact networks unable to represent
frequency dynamics with accurate high-frequency estimation. Towards this end,
we introduce a customized design for slim DPM, which we term as Spectral
Diffusion (SD), for light-weight image synthesis. SD incorporates wavelet
gating in its architecture to enable frequency dynamic feature extraction at
every reverse steps, and conducts spectrum-aware distillation to promote
high-frequency recovery by inverse weighting the objective based on spectrum
magni tudes. Experimental results demonstrate that, SD achieves 8-18x
computational complexity reduction as compared to the latent diffusion models
on a series of conditional and unconditional image generation tasks while
retaining competitive image fidelity.

important when it comes to developing their product or solving their issue.
Understanding customer feedback, responses, and important details of the

(NER). For extracting the entities we would be converting the conversations to
text using the optimal speech-to-text model. The model would be a two-stage
network in which the conversation is converted to text. Then, suitable entities
are extracted using robust techniques using a NER BERT transformer model. This
will aid in the enrichment of customer experience when there is an issue which
is faced by them. If a customer faces a problem he will call and register his
complaint. The model will then extract the key features from this conversation
which will be necessary to look into the problem. These features would include
details like the order number, and the exact problem. All these would be
extracted directly from the conversation and this would reduce the effort of
going through the conversation again.

Motivated by the idea of semisoft clustering of data, we propose a semisoft

structure for both pure and mixed tasks as well as select the relevant
features. The main assumption behind our approach is that each cluster has some
pure tasks, and each mixed task can be represented by a linear combination of
pure tasks in different clusters. To solve the resulting non-convex constrained
optimization problem, we design an efficient three-step algorithm. The
experimental results based on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Finally, we extend the

approaches enabling inference of latent source spaces representative of neural

of transcoding -- mapping from a specific encoding (modality) to a decoding
(the latent source space) and then encoding the latent source space to the
other modality. Specifically, we develop a symmetric method consisting of a
cyclic convolutional transcoder that transcodes EEG to fMRI and vice versa.
Without any prior knowledge of either the hemodynamic response function or lead
field matrix, the complete data-driven method exploits the temporal and spatial
relationships between the modalities and latent source spaces to learn these
mappings. We quantify, for both the simulated and real EEG-fMRI data, how well
the modalities can be transcoded from one to another as well as the source
spaces that are recovered, all evaluated on unseen data. In addition to
enabling a new way to symmetrically infer a latent source space, the method can
also be seen as low-cost computational neuroimaging -- i.e. generating an
