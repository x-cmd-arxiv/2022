$\gamma + g \rightarrow B_c + b + \bar{c}$ and $q + \bar{q} \rightarrow B_c + b

known to show a transition from a disease-free to an endemic equilibrium as the

this model maps to Hethcote's classic endemic model originally published in
1973. In this way one obtains unifying formulas for a whole class of models
showing endemic bifurcation. In particular, if the vaccination rate is smaller
than the recovery rate and $r_- < r_0 < r_+$ for certain upper and lower bounds
$r_\pm$, then trajectories spiral into the endemic equilibrium via damped
infection waves. Latest data of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant suggest that
according to this simplified model continuous vaccination programs will not be
capable to escape the oscillating endemic phase. However, in view of the strong
damping factors predicted by the model, in reality these oscillations will

designing globally constraint-preserving finite volume time domain (FVTD) and
discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) schemes for computational
electrodynamics (CED). In those schemes, we can achieve high-order temporal
accuracy with the help of Runge-Kutta or ADER time-stepping. This paper
presents the design of a multidimensional approximate Generalized Riemann
Problem (GRP) solver for the first time. The multidimensional Riemann solver
accepts as its inputs the four states surrounding an edge on a structured mesh,
and its output consists of a resolved state and its associated fluxes. In
contrast, the multidimensional GRP solver accepts as its inputs the four states
and their gradients in all directions; its output consists of the resolved
state and its corresponding fluxes and the gradients of the resolved state. The
gradients can then be used to extend the solution in time. As a result, we
achieve second-order temporal accuracy in a single step.
  In this work, the formulation is optimized for linear hyperbolic systems with
stiff, linear source terms because such a formulation will find maximal use in
CED. Our formulation produces an overall constraint-preserving time-stepping
strategy based on the GRP that is provably L-stable in the presence of stiff
source terms. We present several stringent test problems, showing that the
multidimensional GRP solver for CED meets its design accuracy and performs
stably with optimal time steps. The test problems include cases with high
conductivity, showing that the beneficial L-stability is indeed realized in
practical applications.

a feasible procedure to investigate the few-quark states with possible few-body
confinement mechanisms, which can be extended to the multiquark states easily.
For each baryon, we extract the mass, mean-square radius, charge radius, and
the quark distributions. We use the Jackknife resampling method to estimate the
statistical uncertainties of masses to be less than 1 MeV. To determine the
baryon charge radii, we include the constituent quark size effect, which is
fixed by the experimental and lattice QCD results. Our results show that both
two-body and three-body confinement mechanisms can give a good description of
the experimental data if the parameters are chosen properly. In the flux-tube
confinement, introducing different tension parameters for the baryons and
mesons are necessary, specifically, $\sigma_Y= 0.9204 \sigma_{Q\bar{Q}}$. The
lesson from the calculation of the nucleon mass with the DMC method is that the
improper pre-assignment of the channels may prevent us from obtaining the real

unusable for visual search. We refer to this learning problem as Compatible
Lifelong Learning Representations (CL2R) as it considers compatible

stationarity as the property that the feature representation is required to
hold to achieve compatibility and propose a novel training procedure that
encourages local and global stationarity on the learned representation. Due to
stationarity, the statistical properties of the learned features do not change
over time, making them interoperable with previously learned features.

the deployment of Mixed Reality (MR) into manufacturing, medical, and
construction applications. To face this challenge, a series of methods have
been proposed. While many approaches use dynamic augmentations such as
animations, arrows, or text to assist users, they require tracking the position
of real objects. In contrast, when tracking of the real objects is not
available or desired, alternative approaches use virtual replicas of real
objects to allow for interactive, perceptual virtual-to-real, and/or
real-to-virtual alignment. In these cases, the accuracy achieved strongly
depends on the quality of the perceptual information provided to the user. This
paper proposes a novel set of perceptual alignment concepts that go beyond the
use of traditional visualization of virtual replicas, introducing the concept
of COMPLEMENTARY TEXTURES to improve interactive alignment in MR applications.
To showcase the advantages of using COMPLEMENTARY TEXTURES, we describe three
different implementations that provide highly salient visual cues when
misalignment is observed; or present semantic augmentations that, when combined
with a real object, provide contextual information that can be used during the
alignment process. The authors aim to open new paths for the community to
explore rather than describing end-to-end solutions. The objective is to show
the multitude of opportunities such concepts could provide for further research

$f(Q,T)$ equations depend on the form of the matter Lagrangian and hence they
also have a degeneracy that has influence on the density evolution of dust
matter and radiation, on the form of the generalized Friedmann equations and
also shows changes in the cosmological parameters confidence regions when
performing Monte Carlo Markov Chains analyses. Our results suggest that since
changing the matter Lagrangian causes different theoretical and cosmological

mechanics in open quantum systems. However, it can have two different origins
or mechanisms depending on the dynamics one is considering, speaking then about
intrinsic decoherence for isolated systems and environmental decoherence due to
dissipation/fluctuations for open systems. This second mechanism can not be
considered for backflow since no thermal fluctuation terms can be added in the
formalism in order to keep an important requirement for the occurrence of this
effect: only contributions of positive momenta along time should be maintained.
The purpose of this work is to analyze the backflow effect in the light of the
underlying intrinsic decoherence and the dissipative dynamics. For this goal,
we first deal with the Milburn approach where a mean frequency of the unitary
evolution steps undergone for the system is assumed. A comparative analysis is
carried out in terms of the Lindblad master equation. Second, the so-called
quantum-to-classical transition wave equation is analyzed from a linear scaled
Schr\""odinger equation which is derived and expressed in terms of a continuous
parameter covering from the quantum to the classical regime as well as all
in-between dynamical non-classical regimes. This theoretical analysis is
inspired by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. And third, in order to
complete our analysis, the transition wave equation formalism is also applied
to dissipative backflow within the Caldirola-Kanai approach where the
dissipative dynamics comes from an effective Hamiltonian. In all the cases
treated here, backflow is gradually suppressed as the intrinsic decoherence
process is developing, paying a special attention to the classical limit. The
route to classicality is not unique.

vaccination) wanes in one big leap, from complete immunity to complete
susceptibility. For many diseases immunity on the contrary wanes gradually,
something that's become even more evident during COVID-19 pandemic where also
recently infected have a reinfection risk, and where booster vaccines are given
to increase immunity. This paper considers an epidemic model allowing for such
gradual waning of immunity (either linear or exponential waning) thereby
extending SIRS epidemics, and also incorporates vaccination. The two versions
for gradual waning of immunity are compared with the classic SIRS epidemic,
where the three models are calibrated by having the same \emph{average
cumulative immunity}. All models are shown to have identical basic reproduction
number $R_0$. However, if no prevention is put in place, the exponential waning
model has highest prevalence and the classic SIRS model has lowest. Similarly,
the amount of vaccine supply needed to reach and maintain herd immunity is
highest for the model with exponential decay of immunity and lowest for the
classic SIRS model. consequently, if truth lies close to exponential (or
linear) decay of immunity, expressions based on the SIRS epidemic will
underestimate the endemic level and the critical vaccine supply will not be
sufficient to reach and maintain herd immunity. For parameter choices fitting
to COVID-19, the critical amount of vaccine supply is about 50% higher if
immunity wanes linearly, and more than 150% higher when immunity wanes
exponentially, as compared to the classic SIRS epidemic model.

vital role in the AIS treatment planning and prevention of further injuries.
The current standard AIS assessment method, which thresholds the 3D measurement

enough. Due to this fact, in this article, we propose the imbalanced Temporal
Deep Gaussian Process (iTDGP), a probabilistic model that can improve AIS

effectively extract temporal information from the CTP time series and map it to
the class labels of the brain's voxels. In addition, by using batch training
and voxel-level analysis iTDGP can learn from a few patients and it is robust
against imbalanced classes. Moreover, our model incorporates a post-processor
capable of improving prediction accuracy using spatial information. Our
comprehensive experiments, on the ISLES 2018 and the University of Alberta

this paper we discover that, for Riemann surfaces of genus two and even spin
structures, a collection of novel identities leads to a dramatic simplification
of the spin structure sum. Explicit formulas for an arbitrary number of vertex
points are obtained in two steps. First, we show that the spin structure
dependence of a cyclic product of Szeg\""o kernels (i.e. Dirac propagators for
worldsheet fermions) may be reduced to the spin structure dependence of the
four-point function. Of particular importance are certain trilinear relations
that we shall define and prove. In a second step, the known expressions for the
genus-two even spin structure measure are used to perform the remaining spin
structure sums. The dependence of the spin summand on the vertex points is
reduced to simple building blocks that can already be identified from the
two-point function. The hyper-elliptic formulation of genus-two Riemann
surfaces is used to derive these results, and its $SL(2,\mathbb C)$ covariance
is employed to organize the calculations and the structure of the final
formulas. The translation of these results into the language of Riemann

progress by leveraging Personalized Item Frequency (PIF) as one of the main
features, which measures the frequency of the user's interactions with the
item. However, taking the PIF as an explicit feature incurs bias towards
frequent items. Items that a user purchases frequently are assigned higher
weights in the PIF-based recommender system and appear more frequently in the
personalized recommendation list. As a result, the system will lose the
fairness and balance between items that the user frequently purchases and items
that the user never purchases. We refer to this systematic bias on personalized
recommendation lists as frequency bias, which narrows users' browsing scope and
reduces the system utility. We adopt causal inference theory to address this
issue. Considering the influence of historical purchases on users' future
interests, the user and item representations can be viewed as unobserved
confounders in the causal diagram. In this paper, we propose a deconfounder
model named FENDER (Frequency-aware Deconfounder for Next-basket

layer to obtain substitute confounders for users and items. Then, FENDER
performs unbiased recommendations considering the effect of these substitute
confounders. Experimental results demonstrate that FENDER has derived diverse

achieving competitive performance. Further experiments illustrate how FENDER

calculate geometric phases along adiabatic cycles as follows. The geometric
phase is a line integral along an adiabatic cycle, and if the cycle encircles a
degeneracy point, the phase becomes non-trivial. If the cycle crosses the
degeneracy point the phase diverges. We construct quantities which are
well-defined when the path crosses the degeneracy point. We do this by
constructing a generalized Bargmann invariant, and noting that it can be
interpreted as a cumulant generating function, with the geometric phase being
the first cumulant. We show that particular ratios of cumulants remain finite
for cycles crossing a set of isolated degeneracy points. The cumulant ratios
take the form of the Binder cumulants known from the theory of finite size
scaling in statistical mechanics (we name them geometric Binder cumulants).
Two, we show that the machinery developed can be applied to perform finite size
scaling in the context of the modern theory of polarization. The geometric
Binder cumulants are size independent at gap closure points or regions with
closed gap (Luttinger liquid). We demonstrate this by model calculations for a
one-dimensional topological model, several two-dimensional models, and a
one-dimensional correlated model. In the case of two dimensions we analyze to
different situations, one in which the Fermi surface is one-dimensional (a
line), and two cases in which it is zero dimensional (Dirac points). For the
geometric Binder cumulants the gap closure points can be found by one
dimensional scaling even in two dimensions. As a technical point we stress that
only certain finite difference approximations for the cumulants are applicable,
since not all approximation schemes are capable of extracting the size scaling
information in the case of a closed gap system.

antenna (LWA) that can enable PHY security by achieving the functionalities of
directional modulation (DM). From the theoretical perspective, we first show
how the proposed space-time MTM antenna architecture can achieve DM through
both the spatial and spectral manipulation of the orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) signal received by a user equipment (UE). Simulation
results are then provided as proof-of-principle, demonstrating the
applicability of our approach for achieving DM in various communication
settings. To further validate our simulation results, we realize a prototype of
the proposed architecture controlled by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
which achieves DM via an optimized coding sequence carried out by the
branch-and-bound algorithm corresponding to the states of the MTM LWA's unit
cells. Experimental results confirm the theory behind the space-time-modulated
MTM LWA in achieving DM, which is observed via both the spectral harmonic
patterns and bit error rate (BER) measurements.

goal of the planetary science community. So far, most modeling studies have
focused on predicting the enrichment of heavy elements and the C/O ratio in
giant planet atmospheres. Although this framework provides useful constraints
on the potential formation locations of gas giant exoplanets, carbon and oxygen
measurements alone are not enough to determine where a given gas giant planet
originated. Here, we show that characterizing the abundances of refractory
elements (e.g., silicon, iron) can break these degeneracies. Refractory
elements are present in the solid phase throughout most of the disk and their
atmospheric abundances therefore reflect the solid-to-gas accretion ratio
during formation. We introduce a new framework that parameterizes the
atmospheric abundances of gas giant exoplanets in the form of three ratios:
Si/H, O/Si, and C/Si. Si/H traces the solid-to-gas accretion ratio of a planet
and is loosely equivalent to earlier notions of 'metallicity'. For O/Si and
C/Si, we present a global picture of their variation with distance and time
based on what we know from the solar system meteorites and an updated
understanding of the variations of thermal processing within protoplanetary
disks. We show that ultra-hot Jupiters are ideal targets for atmospheric
characterization studies using this framework, as we can measure the abundances
of refractories, oxygen and carbon in the gas phase. Finally, we propose that
hot Jupiters with silicate clouds and low water abundances might have accreted

for downlink multiple input single output (MISO) Rate-Splitting multiple access
(RSMA) networks. The transmitter concurrently communicates with the information
receivers (IRs) and sends energy to untrusted energy receivers (UERs). UERs are
also able to wiretap the IR streams. The paper assumes that the channel state
information (CSI) of the IRs is known at the transmitter. However, only
imperfect CSI (ICSI) for the UERs is available at the transmitter. The paper
aims to maximize the achievable worst-case sum secrecy rate (WCSSR) of the IRs
under a total transmit power constraint, a sum energy constraint for the UERs,
and constraints on the transmission and reflection coefficients by jointly
optimizing the precoders and the transmission and reflection beamforming at the
STAR-RIS. The formulated problem is non-convex with intricately coupled
variables, and to tackle this challenge a suboptimal two-step iterative

the language in which requirements are written, and the tools needed to operate

Particularly, analysis of perceptually fluent speech enables identifying the

young children, especially those who stutter, may get adversely affected by
situational physiological arousal. A major contribution of this paper is
leveraging the speaker's situational physiological responses in real-time to
analyze the speech signal effectively. The presented PASAD approach adapts a
Hyper-Network structure to extract temporal speech importance information
leveraging physiological parameters. In addition, a novel non-local acoustic
spectrogram feature extraction network identifies meaningful acoustic
attributes. Finally, a sequential network utilizes the acoustic attributes and
the extracted temporal speech importance for effective classification. We
collected speech and physiological sensing data from 73 preschool-age children
who stutter (CWS) and who don't stutter (CWNS) in different conditions. PASAD's
unique architecture enables visualizing speech attributes distinct to a CWS's
fluent speech and mapping them to the speaker's respective speech-motor-control

understanding of children's fluent speech, speech-motor-control (SMC), and
stuttering development. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that PASAD

  Waals heterostructures","11 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Spin-charge interconversion (SCI) is a central phenomenon to the development
of spintronic devices from materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In
the case of materials with high crystal symmetry, the only allowed SCI
processes are those where the spin current, charge current and spin
polarization directions are orthogonal to each other. Consequently, standard
SCI experiments are designed to maximize the signals arising from the SCI
processes with conventional mutually orthogonal geometry. However, in
low-symmetry materials, certain non-orthogonal SCI processes are also allowed.
Since the standard SCI experiment is limited to charge current flowing only in
one direction in the SOC material, certain allowed SCI configurations remain
unexplored. In this work, we performed a thorough SCI study in a graphene-based
lateral spin valve combined with low-symmetry MoTe$_2$. Due to a very low
contact resistance between the two materials, we could detect SCI signals using
both a standard configuration, where the charge current is applied along the
MoTe$_2$, and a recently introduced (3D-current) configuration, where the
charge current flow can be controlled in three directions within the
heterostructure. As a result, we observed three different SCI components, one
orthogonal and two non-orthogonal, giving new insight into the SCI processes in
low-symmetry materials. The large SCI signals obtained at room temperature,
along with the versatility of the 3D-current configuration, provide feasibility
and flexibility to the design of the next generation of spin-based devices.

behind the galaxy cluster Abell2744 (hereafter A2744-z7p9OD). Using JWST
NIRSpec, we find seven galaxies within a projected radius of 60kpc. Although
the galaxies reside in an overdensity around $>20\times$ greater than a random
volume, they do not show strong Lyman-alpha emission. We place 2-$\sigma$ upper
limits on the rest-frame equivalent width $<16$-$28$AA. Based on the tight
upper limits to the Lyman-alpha emission, we constrain the volume-averaged
neutral fraction of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium to be $x_{\rm HI} >
0.45$ (68% CI). Using an empirical $M_{\rm UV}$-$M_{\rm halo}$ relation for
individual galaxies, we estimate that the total halo mass of the system is
$\gtrsim 4\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$. Likewise, the line of sight velocity
dispersion is estimated to be $1100 \pm 200$km/s. Using an empirical relation,

VMMR focuses on make and model, while re-id focuses on vehicle ID. It is
promising to combine these datasets to take advantage of knowledge across

datasets that contain an annotation schema, to transfer knowledge to datasets
without that annotation. Using ATEAM, we integrated several common vehicle

aimed to reduce short-term poverty by direct cash transfers and to fight
long-term poverty by increasing human capital among poor Brazilian people.
Eligibility for Bolsa Familia benefits depends on a cutoff rule, which
classifies the BF study as a regression discontinuity (RD) design. Extracting
causal information from RD studies is challenging. Following Li et al (2015)
and Branson and Mealli (2019), we formally describe the BF RD design as a local
randomized experiment within the potential outcome approach. Under this
framework, causal effects can be identified and estimated on a subpopulation
where a local overlap assumption, a local SUTVA and a local ignorability
assumption hold. Potential advantages of this framework over local regression
methods based on continuity assumptions concern the causal estimands, the
analysis, and the interpretation of the results. A critical issue of this local
randomization approach is how to choose subpopulations for which we can draw
valid causal inference. We propose a Bayesian model-based finite mixture
approach to clustering to classify observations into subpopulations where the
RD assumptions hold and do not hold. This approach has important advantages: a)
it allows to account for the uncertainty in the subpopulation membership, which
is typically neglected; b) it does not impose any constraint on the shape of
the subpopulation; c) it is scalable to high-dimensional settings; e) it allows
to target alternative causal estimands than average effects; and f) it is
robust to a certain degree of manipulation/selection of the running variable.

class: we might assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in
the class (usually referred to as the realizable setting), or we might evaluate
the learned model by comparing it with the best hypothesis in the class (the
agnostic setting).
  Taking a step beyond these classic setups that involve only a single
hypothesis class, we introduce comparative learning as a combination of the
realizable and agnostic settings in PAC learning: given two binary hypothesis
classes $S$ and $B$, we assume that the data is labeled according to a
hypothesis in the source class $S$ and require the learned model to achieve an
accuracy comparable to the best hypothesis in the benchmark class $B$. Even
when both $S$ and $B$ have infinite VC dimensions, comparative learning can
still have a small sample complexity. We show that the sample complexity of
comparative learning is characterized by the mutual VC dimension
$\mathsf{VC}(S,B)$ which we define to be the maximum size of a subset shattered
by both $S$ and $B$. We also show a similar result in the online setting, where
we give a regret characterization in terms of the mutual Littlestone dimension
$\mathsf{Ldim}(S,B)$. These results also hold for partial hypotheses.
  We additionally show that the insights necessary to characterize the sample
complexity of comparative learning can be applied to characterize the sample
complexity of realizable multiaccuracy and multicalibration using the mutual
fat-shattering dimension, an analogue of the mutual VC dimension for
real-valued hypotheses. This not only solves an open problem proposed by Hu,
Peale, Reingold (2022), but also leads to independently interesting results
extending classic ones about regression, boosting, and covering number to our

that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage
and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question
answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second,
we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration,
robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core
scenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond
accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We
also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze
specific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open,
limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not
previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average
were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent
models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now
all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and
metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level
findings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and
completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular

spectra induces a major problem of the leakage between $E$- and $B$-modes of
CMB polarization. We present a machine learning approach to remove this
$E$-to-$B$ leakage problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN). For
$N_{\rm{side}}=256$, we develop a CNN system to predict the full sky spectra
with multipole range $2 \leq \ell \leq 384$ from the partial sky spectra with
multipole range $2 \leq \ell \leq 512$ for both $E$- and $B$-modes
simultaneously. We use the theoretical spectrum with tensor-to-scalar ratio
$r=0.001$ to simulate the realization maps of CMB polarization. We train our
CNN system using $10^5$ number of training samples of full sky spectra obtained
from these realization maps and corresponding partial spectra obtained from the
masked realization maps. We analyse two cases (i.e., partial sky respectively
containing $\sim 80\%$ and $\sim 10\%$ of the sky area) individually after
training the same CNN system for each of these two cases. The full sky $E$- and
$B$-modes spectra predicted by our trained CNN system agree excellently with
the corresponding target full sky spectra as well as the theoretical spectra of
these CMB polarization modes. Interestingly, these predicted full sky spectra
of these polarization modes also preserve the cosmic variances at each
multipole. We note that the significance ratios of these predicted full sky
spectra for each of these polarization modes dominantly lie within $3\sigma$.
Moreover, our trained CNN system effectively remove the significant
correlations appeared in the partial sky $E$- and $B$-modes spectra. Thus, the
trained CNN system, developed by us, can predict the full sky $E$- and
$B$-modes spectra from the corresponding partial sky spectra preserving the
entire statistical properties and removing the problem of so-called $E$-to-$B$
leakage.

learning of NLP tasks, there is limited understanding of what drives successful
few-shot adaptation in datasets. In particular, given a new dataset and a
pre-trained model, what properties of the dataset make it \emph{few-shot
learnable} and are these properties independent of the specific adaptation
techniques used? We consider an extensive set of recent few-shot learning
methods, and show that their performance across a large number of datasets is
highly correlated, showing that few-shot hardness may be intrinsic to datasets,
for a given pre-trained model. To estimate intrinsic few-shot hardness, we then
propose a simple and lightweight metric called ""Spread"" that captures the
intuition that few-shot learning is made possible by exploiting feature-space
invariances between training and test samples. Our metric better accounts for
few-shot hardness compared to existing notions of hardness, and is ~8-100x

fundamental phenomenon of decoherence. The purpose of quantum error correction
(QEC) is to counteract the natural tendency of a complex system to decohere.
This cooperative process, which requires participation of multiple quantum and
classical components, creates a special type of dissipation that removes the
entropy caused by the errors faster than the rate at which these errors corrupt
the stored quantum information. Previous experimental attempts to engineer such
a process faced an excessive generation of errors that overwhelmed the
error-correcting capability of the process itself. Whether it is practically
possible to utilize QEC for extending quantum coherence thus remains an open
question. We answer it by demonstrating a fully stabilized and error-corrected
logical qubit whose quantum coherence is significantly longer than that of all
the imperfect quantum components involved in the QEC process, beating the best
of them with a coherence gain of $G = 2.27 \pm 0.07$. We achieve this
performance by combining innovations in several domains including the
fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits and model-free reinforcement

models, MAGE uses semantic tokens learned by a vector-quantized GAN at inputs
and outputs, combining this with masking. We can further improve the
representation by adding a contrastive loss to the encoder output. We
extensively evaluate the generation and representation learning capabilities of
MAGE. On ImageNet-1K, a single MAGE ViT-L model obtains 9.10 FID in the task of

hot Jupiters, particularly those with a large misalignment between the stellar
spin axis and orbital angular momentum axis of the planet. In one version of
high-eccentricity migration, an inclined stellar companion excites von
Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) eccentricity oscillations of a cold Jupiter, and tidal
dissipation causes the planet's orbit to shrink and circularize. Throughout
this process, the stellar spin can evolve chaotically, resulting in highly
misaligned hot Jupiters. Previous population studies of this migration
mechanism have assumed that the stellar spin is aligned with the planetary
orbital angular momentum when the companion begins to induce ZLK oscillations.
However, in the presence of a binary companion, the star's obliquity may be
significantly excited during the dissipation of its protoplanetary disk. We
calculate the stellar obliquities produced in the protoplanetary disk phase and
use these to perform an updated population synthesis of ZLK-driven
high-eccentricity migration. We find that the resulting obliquity distribution
of HJ systems is predominantly retrograde with a broad peak near 90$^\circ$.
The distribution we obtain has intriguing similarities to the recently-observed
preponderance of perpendicular planets close to their host stars.

show that SBI -- with its combination of fast and amortized posterior

metallicities. Our uncertainty constraints are comparable to or moderately
weaker than traditional inverse-modeling with Bayesian MCMC methods (e.g., 0.17

misalignment generated during the radiation era. For large scalar masses (above

misalignment, by which the scalar field is driven towards large field values as
a result of the finite-temperature effective potential. The dominance of
thermal misalignment in this mass range leads to a sharp relic abundance
prediction which, is to a significant extent, insensitive to the initial
conditions of the scalar field. On the other hand, for low mass scalars (below

which is caused by the induced scalar field vacuum expectation value triggered
by the electroweak phase transition. We show that the relic abundance in this
low mass range is sensitive to the scalar field initial conditions. In the
intermediate mass range, the relic abundance is a consequence of a competition
between thermal misalignment and VEV misalignment, leading to novel forced
resonance effects which cause a recurring enhancement and suppression in the
late time oscillation amplitude as a function of the scalar mass. We compare
our relic abundance predictions with constraints and projections from
equivalence principle and inverse square law tests, stellar cooling, resonant
molecular absorption, and observations of extra-galactic background light and
diffuse X-ray backgrounds. New experimental ideas are needed to probe most of
the cosmologically motivated regions of parameter space.

elementary terms from the Hamiltonian in a sequential manner. However, such an
implementation of Trotter steps has gate complexity depending on the total
Hamiltonian term number, comparing unfavorably to algorithms using more
advanced techniques. We develop methods to perform faster Trotter steps with
complexity sublinear in the number of terms. We achieve this for a class of
Hamiltonians whose interaction strength decays with distance according to power
law. Our methods include one based on a recursive block encoding and one based
on an average-cost simulation, overcoming the normalization-factor barrier of
these advanced quantum simulation techniques. We also realize faster Trotter
steps when certain blocks of Hamiltonian coefficients have low rank. Combining
with a tighter error analysis, we show that it suffices to use
$\left(\eta^{1/3}n^{1/3}+\frac{n^{2/3}}{\eta^{2/3}}\right)n^{1+o(1)}$ gates to
simulate uniform electron gas with $n$ spin orbitals and $\eta$ electrons in
second quantization in real space, asymptotically improving over the best
previous work. We obtain an analogous result when the external potential of
nuclei is introduced under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We prove a
circuit lower bound when the Hamiltonian coefficients take a continuum range of
values, showing that generic $n$-qubit $2$-local Hamiltonians with commuting
terms require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ gates to evolve with accuracy
$\epsilon=\Omega(1/poly(n))$ for time $t=\Omega(\epsilon)$. Our proof is based
on a gate-efficient reduction from the approximate synthesis of diagonal
unitaries within the Hamming weight-$2$ subspace, which may be of independent
interest. Our result thus suggests the use of Hamiltonian structural properties
as both necessary and sufficient to implement Trotter steps with lower gate
complexity.

our understanding of how galaxies populate their host dark matter halos. In
essence, the SHAM framework is to find a dark matter halo property that best
correlates with an attribute of galaxies, such as stellar mass. The peak value
of the maximum circular velocity ($V_{\rm max}$) a halo/subhalo has ever
attained throughout its lifetime, $V_{\rm peak}$, has been a popular choice for
SHAM. A recent study by Tonnesen & Ostriker (2021) suggested that quantity
$\phi$, which combines the present-day $V_{\rm max}$ and the peak value of halo
dark matter mass, performs better in predicting stellar mass than $V_{\rm
peak}$. Inspired by their approach, in this work, we find that further
improvement can be achieved by a quantity $\psi_5$ that combines the 90th
percentile of $V_{\rm max}$ a halo/subhalo has ever achieved with the 60th
percentile of the dark matter halo time variation rate. Tests based on the

extensively studied to learn about the underlying cosmology, notwithstanding
that physical processes regulating their properties are poorly understood. To
shed light on these processes, we introduce the Pandora suite of 17
high-resolution (3.5 parsec half-cell side) dwarf galaxy formation cosmological
simulations. Commencing with thermo-turbulent star formation and mechanical
supernova feedback, we gradually increase the complexity of physics
incorporated leading to full-physics models combining magnetism, on-the-fly
radiative transfer and the corresponding stellar photoheating, and
SN-accelerated cosmic rays. We investigate combinations of these processes,
comparing them with observations to constrain what are the main mechanisms
determining dwarf galaxy properties. We find hydrodynamical `SN feedback-only'
simulations struggle to produce realistic dwarf galaxies, leading either to
overquenched or too centrally concentrated, dispersion dominated systems when
compared to observed field dwarfs. Accounting for radiation with cosmic rays
results in extended and rotationally-supported systems. Spatially `distributed'
feedback leads to realistic stellar and HI masses as well as kinematics.
Furthermore, resolved kinematic maps of our full-physics models predict
kinematically distinct clumps and kinematic misalignments of stars, HI and HII
after star formation events. Episodic star formation combined with its
associated feedback induces more core-like dark matter central profiles, which
our `SN feedback-only' models struggle to achieve. Our results demonstrate the
complexity of physical processes required to capture realistic dwarf galaxy
properties, making tangible predictions for integral field unit surveys, radio
synchrotron emission, and for galaxy and multi-phase interstellar medium
properties that JWST will probe.

sloshing cool core cluster in which the activity of the central galaxy has
excavated a pair of cavities and possibly uplifted enriched gas to an altitude
of ~30 kpc. In the cluster core, the lowest entropy ICM is preferentially found
in a 20 kpc-long filament tangential to the southern radio lobe of the AGN. We
argue that the observed cool (~1.3 keV) filament is likely produced by a
combination of sloshing and stimulated ICM cooling, that may be fueling the
central supermassive black hole. Additionally, we determine that the X-ray
emission of the BCG originates from a ~1.4 keV plasma kernel which extends for
5 kpc in radius and has a short cooling time (~240 Myr), and could represent
the thermal corona of the BCG. Overall, we propose that several sources (the
large scale ICM, the low entropy filament and the ~1.4 keV kernel) of cold

we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda>\lambda_c$ with a moderate

$\log(M_{\mathrm{vir}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})>14$ galaxy clusters at $z\sim 0$. We
find the average deviation in MWA from the MWA-$M_\star$ relation depends on
position in PPS, with a maximum difference between the inner cluster and
infalling interloper galaxies of $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our model employs infall
information from N-body simulations and stochastic star-formation histories
from the UniverseMachine model. We find total quenching times of
$t_\mathrm{Q}=3.7\pm 0.4$ Gyr and $t_\mathrm{Q}=4.0\pm 0.2$ Gyr after first

$10<\log(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})<10.5$ galaxies, respectively. By using
MWAs, we break the degeneracy in time of quenching onset and timescale of star
formation rate (SFR) decline. We find that time of quenching onset relative to
pericentre is $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=3.5^{+0.6}_{-0.9}$ Gyr and
$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=-0.3^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ Gyr for our lower and higher stellar

histories remove the need for rapid infall quenching to maintain the bimodality
in the SFR of cluster galaxies; the depth of the green valley prefers quenching
onsets close to first pericentre and a longer quenching envelope, in slight
tension with the MWA-driven results. Taken together these results suggest that
quenching begins close to, or just after pericentre, but the timescale for
quenching to be fully complete is much longer and therefore ram-pressure

insufficient data and considerable parameters. To get around this, some works
strive to explore multimodal cues from RGB-D data. Although improving motion
recognition to some extent, these methods still face sub-optimal situations in
the following aspects: (i) Data augmentation, i.e., the scale of the RGB-D
datasets is still limited, and few efforts have been made to explore novel data
augmentation strategies for videos; (ii) Optimization mechanism, i.e., the
tightly space-time-entangled network structure brings more challenges to
spatiotemporal information modeling; And (iii) cross-modal knowledge fusion,
i.e., the high similarity between multimodal representations caused to
insufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to improve
RGB-D-based motion recognition both from data and algorithm perspectives in
this paper. In more detail, firstly, we introduce a novel video data
augmentation method dubbed ShuffleMix, which acts as a supplement to MixUp, to
provide additional temporal regularization for motion recognition. Secondly, a
Unified Multimodal De-coupling and multi-stage Re-coupling framework, termed
UMDR, is proposed for video representation learning. Finally, a novel
cross-modal Complement Feature Catcher (CFCer) is explored to mine potential
commonalities features in multimodal information as the auxiliary fusion
stream, to improve the late fusion results. The seamless combination of these
novel designs forms a robust spatiotemporal representation and achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art methods on four public motion datasets.
Specifically, UMDR achieves unprecedented improvements of +4.5% on the Chalearn

enter at the electroweak phase transition, which conventionally is fixed near
$\sim$100 GeV. Here we demonstrate that the addition of sub-TeV fields in
supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model permits TeV-scale strongly

no-go arguments with regards to high-temperature symmetry breaking in
supersymmetric models, we show these can be evaded by employing a systematic
suppression of certain thermal corrections in theories with a large number of

of a realistic time varying sky spectrum. The predicted fringing amplitude in
LSST images ranges from $0.04\%$ to $0.2\%$ depending on the location of a CCD
on the focal plane. We find that the predicted variation in surface brightness
caused by fringing in LSST y-band skybackground images is about $0.6\
\mu\rm{Jy}\ \rm{arcsec}^{-2}$, which is 40 times larger than the current
measurement error. We conclude that it is necessary to include fringing
correction in the Rubin's LSST image processing pipeline.

assume that physical responses must be local. Yet, we discover that this is not
necessarily true, even in a system as commonplace as an electric circuit array.
This work reports the experimental observation of non-local impedance response
in a designed circuit network consisting exclusively of passive elements such
as resistors, inductors and capacitors (RLC). Measurements reveal that the
removal of boundary connections dramatically affects the two-point impedance
between certain distant nodes, even in the absence of any amplification
mechanism for the voltage signal. This non local impedance response is distinct
from the reciprocal non-Hermitian skin effect, affecting only selected pairs of
nodes even as the circuit Laplacian exhibits universally broken spectral
bulk-boundary correspondence. Surprisingly, not only are component parasitic
resistances unable to erode the non-local response, but they in fact give rise
to novel loss-induced topological modes at sufficiently large system sizes,
constituting a new manifestation of the critical non-Hermitian skin effect. Our
findings chart a new route towards attaining non-local responses in photonic or
electrical metamaterials without involving non-linear, non-local, active or

supernovae (CCSNe), which release synthesized heavy elements, or failed
supernovae, thereby forming black holes. In the conventional Galactic chemical
evolution (GCE) scheme, a substantial portion of massive stars, e.g., all stars
in the mass range of 8-100 $M_{\odot},$ are assumed to enrich the Galaxy with
their nucleosynthetic products. However, this hypothesis conflicts with the
observations, namely, few CCSNe whose progenitor stars are more massive than
$\sim$18 $M_{\odot}.$ Here, we show that the chemical characteristics shaped by
local thin disk stars are compatible with the predictions by enrichment via
CCSNe limited to less massive progenitors in the new paradigm of Galactic
dynamics that allows stars to migrate from the inner disk. This renewed GCE
model predicts that the bursting star formation events$-$which are considered
to take place in the Galactic bulge as well as in the thick disk$-$generate
more numerous low-mass CCSNe than those expected from the locally determined
canonical initial mass function. This finding suggests a high rate of CCSNe in
early-type galaxies, which reflects a unique cosmic history of the CCSN rate.
With considerable contributions from these galaxies to the cosmic star
formation rates in the early Universe, we predict a more steeply increasing
slope of the CCSN rate with increasing redshift than that in proportion to
cosmic star formation. This predicted redshift evolution agrees well with the
measured rates for 0 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 0.8; however, its predicted CCSN
rate for higher-$z$ calls for more precise data from future surveys.

allows us to determine the interaction between two BPs as a function of the
relative orientation of their polarities and the distance between them. It is

magnetostatic interaction varies in strength and character, being attractive or
repulsive. The obtained results reveal that the BP interaction has a complex

when it hits a certain target value for the first time. Oftentimes, however,
the completion relies on additional constraints that have to be simultaneously
satisfied. Such processes are then called gated first-passage processes.
Despite their ubiquity, and the importance of continuous processes, a unified
framework which allows their systematic study is missing. While the use of a
renewal approach has provided deep insight into the dynamics of gated reactions
in discrete space, a straight forward analogy in continuous space is not
possible due to the ill-defined nature of the first-return process in
continuous space. In this work, we carefully explain this pathology, its
implications, and its remedy. The formalism developed herein allows us to
obtain the full statistics of the gated first-passage time. Notably, our
general formalism extends beyond single-point targets. We first present a
formalism that accounts for interval targets. Then we show how one can obtain
the single-point target formalism as a limiting case of the interval target.
The other limit, of an infinite target, is the problem of threshold crossing,
which is a central theme in extremal statistics. In cases where the underlying
process is heavy-tailed, we provide the asymptotics of the gated process in
terms of the ungated one. Furthermore, our analysis of gated first-passage
processes beyond the single-point target case reveals the need for a refinement
of the definition of crypticity in gated process. Lastly, we demonstrate how
the 1-dimensional formalism can be utilized to obtain results in higher

speech enhancement (SE). In general, the performance of the deep neural network
(DNN) is heavily dependent on the learning of data representation. However, the
DRL's importance is often ignored in many DNN-based SE algorithms. To obtain a
higher quality enhanced speech, we propose a two-stage DRL-based SE method
through adversarial training. In the first stage, we disentangle different
latent variables because disentangled representations can help DNN generate a
better enhanced speech. Specifically, we use the $\beta$-variational
autoencoder (VAE) algorithm to obtain the speech and noise posterior
estimations and related representations from the observed signal. However,
since the posteriors and representations are intractable and we can only apply
a conditional assumption to estimate them, it is difficult to ensure that these
estimations are always pretty accurate, which may potentially degrade the final
accuracy of the signal estimation. To further improve the quality of enhanced
speech, in the second stage, we introduce adversarial training to reduce the
effect of the inaccurate posterior towards signal reconstruction and improve
the signal estimation accuracy, making our algorithm more robust for the
potentially inaccurate posterior estimations. As a result, better SE
performance can be achieved. The experimental results indicate that the
proposed strategy can help similar DNN-based SE algorithms achieve higher
short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech
quality (PESQ), and scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) scores.
Moreover, the proposed algorithm can also outperform recent competitive SE
algorithms.

and its application to a cosmological minisuperspace model. In the first part,
we introduce the problem of time and the theoretical foundations. In the second
part, we focus on a specific minisuperspace universe, analyse it classically,
and quantise it using the canonical quantisation method. The chosen model is a
flat FLRW universe with a free massless scalar field and a perfect fluid. We
extract the Wheeler--DeWitt equation, and calculate its solutions. There are
three dynamical variables that may be used as clock parameters, namely a
coordinate $t$ conjugated to the perfect fluid mass, the massless scalar field
$\varphi$, and $v$, a positive power of the scale factor. We define three
quantum theories, each one based on assuming one of the previous dynamical
quantities as the clock. This quantisation method is then compared with the
Dirac quantisation. We find that, in each quantisation procedure, covariance is
broken, leading to inequivalent quantum theories. In the third part, the
properties of each theory are analysed. Unitarity of each theory is implemented
by adding a boundary condition on the allowed states. Requiring unitarity is
what breaks general covariance in the quantum theory. In the fourth part, we
study the numerical properties of the wave functions in the three theories,
paying special attention to singularity resolution and other divergences from
the classical theory. The $t$-clock theory is able to resolve the singularity,
the $\varphi$-clock theory presents some non trivial dynamics that can be
associated with a resolution of spatial infinity, and the $v$-clock theory does
not show significant deviations from the classical theory. In the last part, we
expand our analysis in order to include another quantisation method: path
integral quantisation, and finally, we conclude.

the premise of a cost-effective enhancement in the computational ability of
hardware-constrained wireless devices (WDs) comprising the Internet of Things
(IoT). In a general multi-server multi-user MEC system, each WD has a
computational task to execute and has to select binary (off)loading decisions,
along with the analog-amplitude resource allocation variables in an online
manner, with the goal of minimizing the overall energy-delay cost (EDC) with
dynamic system states. While past works typically rely on the explicit
expression of the EDC function, the present contribution considers a practical
setting, where in lieu of system state information, the EDC function is not
available in analytical form, and instead only the function values at queried
points are revealed. Towards tackling such a challenging online combinatorial
problem with only bandit information, novel Bayesian optimization (BO) based
approaches are put forth by leveraging the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework.
Per time slot, the discrete offloading decisions are first obtained via the MAB
method, and the analog resource allocation variables are subsequently optimized
using the BO selection rule. By exploiting both temporal and contextual
information, two novel BO approaches, termed time-varying BO and contextual
time-varying BO, are developed. Numerical tests validate the merits of the
proposed BO approaches compared with contemporary benchmarks under different
MEC network sizes.

explained by considering the changes in band filling due to substitution as

variable, can take on a continuum of allowable values, called thermodynamic
macro values. Although referring to the same macro phenomena, the macro
variables of Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) differ from thermodynamic
macro variables in an important respect: within the framework of Boltzmannian
Statistical Mechanics the evolution of macro values of systems with finite
available phase space is invariably modelled as discontinuous, due to the
method of partitioning phase space into macro regions with sharp, fixed
boundaries. Conceptually, this is at odds with the continuous evolution of
macro values as described by thermodynamics, as well as with the continuous
evolution of the micro state assumed in BSM. This discrepancy I call the
discontinuity problem (DP). I show how it arises from BSM's framework and
demonstrate its consequences, in particular for the foundational project of
reducing thermodynamics to BSM: thermodynamic macro values are shown to not
supervene on the corresponding BSM macro values. With supervenience being a
conditio sine qua non for the kind of reduction envisaged by the foundational
project, the latter is in jeopardy.

multi-phase structure around the brightest cluster galaxy. Much work has been
done on understanding the origin of this central nebula, but less work has
studied its eventual fate after the originally filamentary structure is broken
into individual cold clumps. In this paper we perform a suite of 30
(magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of kpc-scale cold clouds with typical
parameters as found by galaxy cluster simulations, to understand whether clouds
are mixed back into the hot ICM or can persist. We investigate the effects of
radiative cooling, small-scale heating, magnetic fields, and (anisotropic)
thermal conduction on the long-term evolution of clouds. We find that filament
fragments cool on timescales shorter than the crushing timescale, fall out of
pressure equilibrium with the hot medium, and shatter, forming smaller
clumplets. These act as nucleation sites for further condensation, and mixing
via Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, causing cold gas mass to double within 75
Myr. Cloud growth depends on density, as well as on local heating processes,
which determine whether clouds undergo ablation- or shattering-driven
evolution. Magnetic fields slow down but don't prevent cloud growth, with the
evolution of both cold and warm phase sensitive to the field topology.
Counter-intuitively, anisotropic thermal conduction increases the cold gas
growth rate compared to non-conductive clouds, leading to larger amounts of
warm phase as well. We conclude that dense clumps on scales of $500$ pc or more
cannot be ignored when studying the long-term cooling flow evolution of galaxy
clusters.

singularities hidden within an event horizon. These singularities provide a key
motivation to go beyond general relativity and look for regular black holes
where the spacetime curvature remains bounded everywhere. A prominent mechanism
achieving this replaces the singularity by a regular patch of de Sitter space.
The resulting regular geometries exhibit two horizons: the outer event horizon
is supplemented by an inner Cauchy horizon. The latter could render the
geometry unstable against perturbations through the so-called mass-inflation
effect, i.e., an exponential growth of the mass function. This chapter reviews
the mass-inflation effect for spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes
contrasting the dynamics of the mass function for Reissner-Nordst\""om and
regular black holes. We also cover recent developments related to the late-time
attractors induced by Hawking radiation which exorcise the exponential growth
of the spacetime curvature encountered in the standard mass-inflation scenario.
In order to make the exposition self-contained, we also briefly discuss basic
properties of regular black holes including their thermodynamics.

we construct such a task based on a tripartite game played by Referee, Alice,

Referee also sends Bob some partial information regarding that value. Alice is
not allowed to know what information is sent to Bob by the Referee. Again, Bob
does not know which value of the random variable is sent to Alice. Now, the
game can be won if and only if Bob can unambiguously identify the value of the
variable with some nonzero probability, no matter what information Bob receives
or which value is sent to Alice. However, to help Bob, Alice sends some limited
amount of information to him, based on a strategy which is fixed by Alice and
Bob before the game begins. We show that if Alice sends limited amount of
classical information then the game cannot be won while the quantum analog of
the `limited amount of classical information' is sufficient for winning the
game. Thus, it establishes quantum advantage. We further analyze several
variants of the game and provide certain bounds on the success probabilities.
Moreover, we establish connections between trine ensemble, mutually unbiased
bases, and the encoding-decoding strategies of those variants. We also discuss
the role of quantum coherence in the present context.

Both methods in the literature use carriers in a specific domain which achieve

such conversations can sometimes escalate into full-blown exchanges of hate and
misinformation. Existing approaches in natural language processing (NLP), such
as deep learning models for classification tasks, use as inputs only a single
comment or a pair of comments depending upon whether the task concerns the
inference of properties of the individual comments or the replies between pairs
of comments, respectively. But in online conversations, comments and replies
may be based on external context beyond the immediately relevant information
that is input to the model. Therefore, being aware of the conversations'
surrounding contexts should improve the model's performance for the inference
task at hand.
  We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses
graph walks to incorporate the wider context of a conversation in a principled
manner. Specifically, a graph walk starts from a given comment and samples
""nearby"" comments in the same or parallel conversation threads, which results
in additional embeddings that are aggregated together with the initial
comment's embedding. We then use these enriched embeddings for downstream NLP
prediction tasks that are important for online conversations. We evaluate
GraphNLI on two such tasks - polarity prediction and misogynistic hate speech
detection - and found that our model consistently outperforms all relevant

random walk performs with a macro-F1 score of 3 and 6 percentage points better

Riemann derivatives ${_q}{D}_nf(x)$ and ${_q}{\bar D}_nf(x)$ are the $n$-th
generalized Riemann derivatives based at $x,x+h,x+qh,x+q^2h,\ldots ,x+q^{n-1}h$
and $x+h,x+qh,x+q^2h,\ldots ,x+q^{n}h$; and one analog of the $n$-th symmetric
Riemann derivative ${D}_n^sf(x)$, the $n$-th symmetric Gaussian Riemann

meteorological features, creating a strongly seasonal pattern of precipitation.
The stability of the monsoon is of extreme importance for a vast range of
ecosystems and for the livelihoods of a large share of the world's population.
Simulations are performed with an intermediate complexity climate model,
PLASIM, to assess the future response of the monsoons to changing
concentrations of aerosols and greenhouse gases. The aerosol loading consists
of a mid-tropospheric warming and a surface cooling, which is applied to India,
Southeast Asia and East China, both concurrently and independently. The primary
effect of increased aerosol loading is a decrease in summer precipitation in
the vicinity of the applied forcing, although the regional response varies
significantly. The decrease in precipitation is only partially ascribable to a
decrease in the precipitable water, and instead derives from a reduction of the
precipitation efficiency, due to changes in the stratification of the
atmosphere. When the aerosol loading is added in all regions simultaneously,
precipitation in East China is most strongly affected, with a quite distinct
transition to a low precipitation regime as the radiative forcing increases
beyond 60 W/m^2. The response is less abrupt as we move westward, with
precipitation in South India being least affected. This lower sensitivity in
South India is attributed to aerosol forcing over East China. Additionally, the
effect on precipitation is approximately linear with the forcing. The impact of
doubling carbon dioxide levels is to increase precipitation over the regions
and weaken the circulation. When the carbon dioxide and aerosol forcings are
applied at the same time, the carbon dioxide forcing partially offsets the
surface cooling and reduction in precipitation associated with the aerosol
response.

gradient echo (MP-GRE) sequences for improved accuracy, precision, and speed of

variable flip-angle (VFA) values that improve MP-GRE sequences used for
3D-T1\r{ho} mapping. This new approach can simultaneously improve the accuracy
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while reducing filtering effects. We
demonstrate the concept in the three different versions of the MP-GRE sequences
that are typically used for 3D-T1rho mapping and evaluate their performance in
model agarose phantoms (n=6) and healthy volunteers (n=5) for knee joint
imaging. We also tested the optimization with sequence parameters targeting
faster acquisitions. Results: Our results show that optimized VFA can improve
the accuracy and the precision of the sequences, seen as a reduction of the
mean of normalized absolute difference (MNAD) from 6~8% to 4~5% in model
phantoms and from 14~22% to 12~14% in the knee joint, and improving SNR from
12~27 to 24~35 in agarose phantoms and 5~13 to 11~16 in healthy volunteers. The
optimization can also compensate for the loss in quality caused by making the
sequence faster. This results in sequence configurations that acquire nearly
twice more data per unit of time with similar SNR and MNAD measurements as
compared to its slower versions. Conclusion: The optimization of the VFA can be
used to increase accuracy and precision, and improve the speed of the typical
imaging sequences used for quantitative 3D-T1rho mapping of the knee joint.

the Lamb vector field and the kinematic vorticity number are considered. The
magnitude of the latter one is found to be smaller than that for the Poiseuille

in which parameters are eliminated from the model according to predefined
groups. However, when the groups overlap, optimizing the group lasso penalized
objective can be time-consuming on large-scale problems because of the
non-separability induced by the overlapping groups. This bottleneck has
seriously limited the application of overlapping group lasso regularization in
many modern problems, such as gene pathway selection and graphical model
estimation. In this paper, we propose a separable penalty as an approximation
of the overlapping group lasso penalty. Thanks to the separability, the
computation of regularization based on our penalty is substantially faster than
that of the overlapping group lasso, especially for large-scale and
high-dimensional problems. We show that the penalty is the tightest separable
relaxation of the overlapping group lasso norm within the family of
$\ell_{q_1}/\ell_{q_2}$ norms. Moreover, we show that the estimator based on
the proposed separable penalty is statistically equivalent to the one based on
the overlapping group lasso penalty with respect to their error bounds and the
rate-optimal performance under the squared loss. We demonstrate the faster
computational time and statistical equivalence of our method compared with the
overlapping group lasso in simulation examples and a classification problem of

  Workshop",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The progress in modelling time series and, more generally, sequences of
structured data has recently revamped research in anomaly detection. The task
stands for identifying abnormal behaviors in financial series, IT systems,
aerospace measurements, and the medical domain, where anomaly detection may aid
in isolating cases of depression and attend the elderly. Anomaly detection in
time series is a complex task since anomalies are rare due to highly non-linear
temporal correlations and since the definition of anomalous is sometimes
subjective. Here we propose the novel use of Hyperbolic uncertainty for Anomaly
Detection (HypAD). HypAD learns self-supervisedly to reconstruct the input
signal. We adopt best practices from the state-of-the-art to encode the
sequence by an LSTM, jointly learned with a decoder to reconstruct the signal,
with the aid of GAN critics. Uncertainty is estimated end-to-end by means of a
hyperbolic neural network. By using uncertainty, HypAD may assess whether it is
certain about the input signal but it fails to reconstruct it because this is
anomalous; or whether the reconstruction error does not necessarily imply
anomaly, as the model is uncertain, e.g. a complex but regular input signal.
The novel key idea is that a detectable anomaly is one where the model is
certain but it predicts wrongly. HypAD outperforms the current state-of-the-art
for univariate anomaly detection on established benchmarks based on data from
NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, and Twitter. It also yields state-of-the-art
performance on a multivariate dataset of anomaly activities in elderly home
residences, and it outperforms the baseline on SWaT. Overall, HypAD yields the
lowest false alarms at the best performance rate, thanks to successfully
identifying detectable anomalies.

information theory. We predict a higher quantum speed limit from the newly
calculated Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds, which in turn imply the
lowering of the Heisenberg limit for parameter estimation. We explicitly derive
a modified quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound relating the uncertainty in determining
a parameter to the inverse of the quantum Fisher information. We finally
discuss the implications of our results on the maximum achievable speed of

Relying on the recently popularized prompt tuning approach, we provide a

pre-train this architecture with a dedicated dense self-supervision scheme

paradigm for accurate indoor localization with limited resources. The goal of
multipath-based SLAM is to detect and localize radio reflective surfaces to
support the estimation of time-varying positions of mobile agents. Radio
reflective surfaces are typically represented by so-called virtual anchors
(VAs), which are mirror images of base stations at the actual surfaces. In
existing multipath-based SLAM methods, a VA is introduced for each propagation
path, even if the goal is to map the reflective surfaces. The fact that not
every reflective surface but every propagation path is modeled by a VA,
complicates a consistent combination ""fusion"" of statistical information across
multiple paths and base stations and thus limits the accuracy and mapping speed
of existing multipath-based SLAM methods. In this paper, we introduce an
improved statistical model and estimation method that enables data fusion for
multipath-based SLAM by representing each surface by a single master virtual
anchor (MVA). We further develop a particle-based sum-product algorithm (SPA)
that performs probabilistic data association to compute marginal posterior
distributions of MVA and agent positions efficiently. A key aspect of the
proposed estimation method based on MVAs is to check the availability of
singlebounce and double-bounce propagation paths at a specific agent position
by means of ray-launching. The availability check is directly integrated into
the statistical model by providing detection probabilities for probabilistic
data association. Numerical results based on simulated and real data
demonstrate significant improvements in estimation accuracy compared to

compatibility graph, where arcs represent compatible kidneys flowing from a
donor in one pair to a patient in another. A challenge faced in real-world
KPDPs is the possibility of a planned match being cancelled, e.g., due to late

develop a two-stage robust optimization approach to the kidney exchange problem
wherein (1) the first stage determines a kidney matching solution according to
the original compatibility graph, and then (2) the second stage repairs the
solution after observing transplant cancellations. In addition to considering
homogeneous failure, we present the first approach that considers
non-homogeneous failure between vertices and arcs. To this end, we develop
solution algorithms with a feasibility-seeking master problem and evaluate two

a quantum chemistry formulation of the density matrix renormalization group

present a new gauge-invariant formulation to detect the spontaneous symmetry
breaking in interacting models. To benchmark our approach, we focus on a
simplified spinless, valleyless IBM model. At integer filling ($\nu=0$), all
numerical methods agree in terms of energy and $C_{2z} \mathcal{T}$ symmetry
breaking. Additionally, as part of our benchmarking, we explore the impact of
different schemes for removing ``double-counting'' in the IBM model. Our
results at integer filling suggest that cross-validation of different IBM

our approach at integer filling, we perform the first systematic study of the
IBM model near integer filling (for $|\nu|< 0.2$). In this regime, we find that
the ground state can be in a metallic and $C_{2z} \mathcal{T}$ symmetry
breaking phase. The ground state appears to have low entropy, and therefore can
be relatively well approximated by a single Slater determinant. Furthermore, we
observe many low entropy states with energies very close to the ground state

metastability in the context of the observationally favoured model of
Starobinsky inflation. Following the motivation and techniques from our first

$\xi$, while embedding the SM on the modified gravity scenario $R+R^2$, which
introduces Starobinsky inflation naturally. This had significant repercussions
for the effective Higgs potential in the form of additional negative terms that
destabilize the false vacuum. Another important aspect lay in the definition
for the end of inflation, as bubble nucleation is most prominent during its

produce network diversity. We combine remote sensing data and novel methods to
provide a generalised framework for assessing and optimising optical ground
station networks. This work is guided by an example network of eight Australian
and New Zealand optical communication ground stations which would span
approximately $60^\circ$ in longitude and $20^\circ$ in latitude. Utilising
time-dependent cloud cover data from five satellites, we present a detailed
analysis determining the availability and diversity of the network, finding the
Australasian region is well-suited for an optical network with a 69% average
site availability and low spatial cloud cover correlations. Employing methods
from computational neuroscience, we provide a Monte Carlo method for sampling
the joint probability distribution of site availabilities for an arbitrarily
sized and point-wise correlated network of ground stations. Furthermore, we
develop a general heuristic for site selection under availability and
correlation optimisations, and combine this with orbital propagation
simulations to compare the data capacity between optimised networks and the
example network. We show that the example network may be capable of providing
tens of terabits per day to a LEO satellite, and up to 99.97% reliability to
GEO satellites. We therefore use the Australasian region to demonstrate novel,

the fluid flow is standard (high Reynolds air flow undisturbed at infinity),

the aileron has only one stable equilibrium when the external forces are
vanishing, but it is bistable when relevant aerodynamic loads are applied.
Hence, for sufficiently high fluid velocities, another equilibrium branch is

bursting aerosols are of particular interest because of their critical role in
mass and momentum transfer across interfaces. All prior studies claim that
bursting of a millimeter-sized bare bubble at an aqueous surface produces jet
drops with a typical size of $\boldsymbol{O}$(100 $\si{\micro\relax}$m), much
larger than film drops of $\boldsymbol{O}$(1 $\si{\micro\relax}$m) from the
disintegration of a bubble cap. Here, we document the hitherto unknown
phenomenon that jet drops can be as small as a few microns when the bursting
bubble is coated by a thin oil layer. We provide evidence that the faster and
smaller jet drops result from the singular dynamics of the oil-coated cavity
collapse. The unique air-oil-water compound interface offers a distinct damping
mechanism to smooth out the precursor capillary waves during cavity collapse,
leading to a more efficient focusing of the dominant wave and thus allowing
singular jets over a much wider parameter space beyond that of a bare bubble.
We develop a theoretical explanation for the parameter limits of the singular
jet regime by considering the interplay among inertia, surface tension, and
viscous effects. As such contaminated bubbles are widely observed, the
previously unrecognized fast and small contaminant-laden jet drops may enhance
bubble-driven flux across the interface, contributing to the aerosolization and
airborne transmission of bulk substances.

supervised learning methods only work on complete data, thus requiring
preprocessing such as missing value imputation to work on incomplete data sets.
However, imputation alone does not encode useful information about the missing
values themselves. For data sets with informative missing patterns, the Missing
Indicator Method (MIM), which adds indicator variables to indicate the missing
pattern, can be used in conjunction with imputation to improve model
performance. While commonly used in data science, MIM is surprisingly
understudied from an empirical and especially theoretical perspective. In this
paper, we show empirically and theoretically that MIM improves performance for
informative missing values, and we prove that MIM does not hurt linear models
asymptotically for uninformative missing values. Additionally, we find that for
high-dimensional data sets with many uninformative indicators, MIM can induce
model overfitting and thus test performance. To address this issue, we
introduce Selective MIM (SMIM), a novel MIM extension that adds missing
indicators only for features that have informative missing patterns. We show
empirically that SMIM performs at least as well as MIM in general, and improves
MIM for high-dimensional data. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of MIM on
real-world data science tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MIM and SMIM

reproduces the known scaling of the viscous $\alpha$-parameter, $\alpha \propto

interpreting high dimensional (HD) data by mapping each point to a low
dimensional (LD) space (usually two-dimensional). It seeks to retain the

initialization procedure, which begins with the random initialization of an LD
vector. Points in this initial vector are then updated to minimize the loss
function (the KL divergence) iteratively using gradient descent. This leads
comparable points to attract one another while pushing dissimilar points apart.
We believe that, by default, these algorithms should employ some form of
informative initialization. Another essential component of the t-SNE is using a
kernel matrix, a similarity matrix comprising the pairwise distances among the
sequences. For t-SNE-based visualization, the Gaussian kernel is employed by
default in the literature. However, we show that kernel selection can also play
a crucial role in the performance of t-SNE. In this work, we assess the
performance of t-SNE with various alternative initialization methods and
kernels, using four different sets, out of which three are biological sequences

compare the proposed methods with the baselines. We show that by using

the accumulation thickness. The accumulation thickness can depict 2D or 3D PT
or even a transition between them. This transition can produce a non-ideal
profile between the linear and saturation regimes in the output curve, region
in which a protuberance/lump appears. Other analyzed phenomenon was the
non-linear behavior for low drain voltage range in the output curve, even when
considering an ohmic contact. According to this proposed model, this curve
behavior is attributed to the traps distribution profile into the semiconductor
and the very thin accumulation layer thickness close to the injection contact.
It was also possible to analyze the conditions when the linear field effect
mobility is higher or lower than the saturation one. Finally, EGOFET and OECT
experimental data were successfully fitted with this model showing its
versatility.

  Ansatz","19 pages, 7 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Parameterized quantum circuits are widely studied approaches for tackling
optimization problems. A prominent example is the Quantum Alternating Operator
Ansatz (QAOA), an approach that builds off the structure of the Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Finding high-quality parameters efficiently
for QAOA remains a major challenge in practice. In this work, we introduce a
classical strategy for parameter setting, suitable for common cases in which
the number of distinct cost values grows only polynomially with the problem
size. The crux of our strategy is that we replace the cost function expectation
value step of QAOA with a parameterized model that can be efficiently evaluated
classically. This model is based on empirical observations that QAOA states
have large overlaps with states where variable configurations with the same
cost have the same amplitude, which we define as Perfect Homogeneity. We thus
define a Classical Homogeneous Proxy for QAOA in which Perfect Homogeneity
holds exactly, and which yields information describing both states and
expectation values. We classically determine high-quality parameters for this
proxy, and use these parameters in QAOA, an approach we label the Homogeneous
Heuristic for Parameter Setting. We numerically examine this heuristic for
MaxCut on random graphs. For up to $3$ QAOA levels we are easily able to find
parameters that match approximation ratios returned by previous globally
optimized approaches. For levels up to $20$ we obtain parameters with
approximation ratios monotonically increasing with depth, while a strategy that
uses parameter transfer instead fails to converge with comparable classical
resources. These results suggest that our heuristic may find good parameters in
regimes that are intractable with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.
Finally, we outline how our heuristic may be applied to wider classes of
problems.

concerns. These concerns are exacerbated by ubiquitous IoT devices with
multiple sensors that can support these surveillance use cases. The work
presented here considers one such use case: the use of a speech emotion
recognition (SER) classifier tied to a smart speaker. This work demonstrates
the ability to evade black-box SER classifiers tied to a smart speaker without
compromising the utility of the smart speaker. This privacy concern is
considered through the lens of adversarial evasion of machine learning. Our
solution, Defeating Acoustic Recognition of Emotion via Genetic Programming
(DARE-GP), uses genetic programming to generate non-invasive additive audio
perturbations (AAPs). By constraining the evolution of these AAPs,
transcription accuracy can be protected while simultaneously degrading SER
classifier performance. The additive nature of these AAPs, along with an
approach that generates these AAPs for a fixed set of users in an utterance and
user location-independent manner, supports real-time, real-world evasion of SER
classifiers. DARE-GP's use of spectral features, which underlay the emotional
content of speech, allows the transferability of AAPs to previously unseen
black-box SER classifiers. Further, DARE-GP outperforms state-of-the-art SER
evasion techniques and is robust against defenses employed by a knowledgeable
adversary. The evaluations in this work culminate with acoustic evaluations
against two off-the-shelf commercial smart speakers, where a single AAP could
evade a black box classifier over 70% of the time. The final evaluation
deployed AAP playback on a small-form-factor system (raspberry pi) integrated

transition. The active phase is sustained by spatio-temporal patterns in the

lattice are utilized to investigate the effect of seasonal variations of the
environment on species coexistence. The results of our simulations are also
compared to a mean-field analysis. We find that the parameter region of
predator and prey coexistence is enlarged relative to the stationary situation
when the carrying capacity varies periodically. The stationary regime of our
periodically varying LV system shows qualitative agreement between the
stochastic model and the mean-field approximation. However, under periodic
carrying capacity switching environments, the mean-field rate equations predict
period-doubling scenarios that are washed out by internal reaction noise in the
stochastic lattice model. Utilizing visual representations of the lattice
simulations and dynamical correlation functions, we study how the pursuit and
evasion waves are affected by ensuing resonance effects. Correlation function
measurements indicate a time delay in the response of the system to sudden
changes in the environment. Resonance features are observed in our simulations
that cause prolonged persistent spatial correlations. Different effective
static environments are explored in the extreme limits of fast- and slow
periodic switching. The analysis of the mean-field equations in the
fast-switching regime enables a semi-quantitative description of the stationary

considered. In survival analysis, one main objective is to identify the
covariates that are associated with the risk of experiencing the event of
interest. The Cox proportional hazard model is being used extensively in
survival analysis in studying the relationship between survival times and
covariates, where the model assumes that the covariate has a log-linear effect
on the hazard function. However, this linearity assumption may not be satisfied
in practice. In order to extract a representative subset of features, various
variable selection approaches have been proposed for survival data under the
linear Cox model. However, there exists little literature on variable selection
for the nonlinear Cox model. To break this gap, we extend the recently
developed deep learning-based variable selection model LassoNet to survival
data. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of
the proposed method. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to analyze a
real data set on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

processing scheme, for cleaning and extraction of the temperature time series
from the thermal images is implemented. To test the accuracy of the thermal
measurements using IR camera, the extracted temperature is compared against the
ground truth surface temperature measurements. It is observed that the
detrended thermal measurements match well with the ground truth surface
temperature measurements. Subsequently, the operational pattern of the
water-cooled systems and window AC units are extracted from the analysis of the
thermal signature. It is observed that for the water-cooled system, the
difference between the rate of change of the window and wall can be used to
extract the operational pattern. While, in the case of the window AC units,
wavelet transform of the AC unit temperature is used to extract the frequency
and time domain information of the AC unit operation. The results of the
analysis are compared against the indoor temperature sensors installed in the
office spaces of the building. It is realized that the accuracy in the
prediction of the operational pattern is highest between 8 pm to 10 am, and it
reduces during the day because of solar radiation and high daytime temperature.
Subsequently, a characterization study is conducted for eight window/split AC
units from the thermal image collected during the nighttime. This forms one of
the first studies on the operational behavior of HVAC systems for
non-residential buildings using the longitudinal thermal imaging technique. The
output from this study can be used to better understand the operational and
occupant behavior, without requiring to deploy a large array of sensors in the

However, we discover that these approaches fall short of the expected
performance because they ignore the existence of a vicious cycle between
classifier divergence and feature mapping inconsistency across clients, such
that client models are updated in inconsistent feature space with diverged
classifiers. We then propose a simple yet effective framework named Federated

calibrate classifier across clients during local training, which allows client
models updating in a shared feature space with consistent classifiers. We
demonstrate that this modification brings similar classifiers and a virtuous

new window onto the (inflationary) origins of primordial fluctuations. While
significantly larger fractional anisotropies are possible (for example, in
multi-field inflation) and would be easier to interpret, it has been argued
that these can only be consistent with CMB bounds if the gravitational wave
signal is correspondingly smaller. In this paper, we show that this argument,
which relies on assuming radiation dominance of the very early universe, can be
evaded if there is an era of early matter dominance of a certain robust type.
This allows large gravitational wave anisotropies to be consistent with

bounding box has a ``tightness'' projection (also referred to as cuboid), which
fits the object contour well on the image while still keeping the geometric
attribute on the 3D space, e.g., physical dimension, pairwise orthogonal, etc.
These requirements bring significant challenges to the annotation. Simply
projecting the Lidar-labeled 3D boxes to the image leads to non-trivial
misalignment, while directly drawing a cuboid on the image cannot access the
original 3D information. In this work, we propose a learning-based 3D box
adaptation approach that automatically adjusts minimum parameters of the

panoramic cameras. With only a few 2D boxes annotation as guidance during the

with 3D properties from Lidar boxes. We call our method ``you only label

image-level cuboid refinement, which balances the accuracy and efficiency well

history in dust-obscured star-forming galaxies around the peak of cosmic star
formation. This will be done via measurements of the redshifted 157.7 um line
of singly ionized carbon ([CII]). TIM employs two R $\sim 250$ long-slit
grating spectrometers covering 240-420 um. Each is equipped with a focal plane
unit containing 4 wafer-sized subarrays of horn-coupled aluminum kinetic
inductance detectors (KIDs). We present the design and performance of a
prototype focal plane assembly for one of TIM's KID-based subarrays. Our design
strictly maintain high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic
environment for the KIDs. The prototype detector housing in combination with
the first flight-like quadrant are tested at 250 mK. Initial frequency scan
shows that many resonances are affected by collisions and/or very shallow
transmission dips as a result of a degraded internal quality factor (Q factor).
This is attributed to the presence of an external magnetic field during
cooldown. We report on a study of magnetic field dependence of the Q factor of
our quadrant array. We implement a Helmholtz coil to vary the magnetic field at
the detectors by (partially) nulling earth's. Our investigation shows that the
earth magnetic field can significantly affect our KIDs' performance by
degrading the Q factor by a factor of 2-5, well below those expected from the
operational temperature or optical loading. We find that we can sufficiently
recover our detectors' quality factor by tuning the current in the coils to
generate a field that matches earth's magnetic field in magnitude to within a
few uT. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a properly designed magnetic
shield enclosing the TIM focal plane unit. Based on the results presented in
this paper, we set a shielding requirement of |B| < 3 uT.

test masses was negative after all releases, leaving the test mass with a
potential in the range $-12$ mV to $-512$ mV. Variations in the neutral test
mass charging rate between $21.7$ e s$^{-1}$ and $30.7$ e s$^{-1}$ were
observed over the course of the 17-month science operations produced by cosmic
ray flux changes including a Forbush decrease associated with a small solar
energetic particle event. A dependence of the cosmic ray charging rate on the
test mass potential between $-30.2$ e s$^{-1}$ V$^{-1}$ and $-40.3$ e s$^{-1}$
V$^{-1}$ was observed and this is attributed to a contribution to charging from
low-energy electrons emitted from the gold surfaces of the gravitational
reference sensor. Data from the on-board particle detector show a reliable
correlation with the charging rate and with other environmental monitors of the
cosmic ray flux. This correlation is exploited to extrapolate test mass
charging rates to a 20-year period giving useful insight into the expected

(ASD) is of vital importance for the diagnosis of Autism and timely early
intervention. However, the observation and recording during the treatment from
the parents of autistic children may not be accurate and objective. In such
cases, automatic recognition systems based on computer vision and machine
learning (in particular deep learning) technology can alleviate this issue to a
large extent. Existing human action recognition models can now achieve
persuasive performance on challenging activity datasets, e.g. daily activity,
and sports activity. However, problem behaviors in children with ASD are very
different from these general activities, and recognizing these problem
behaviors via computer vision is less studied. In this paper, we first evaluate
a strong baseline for action recognition, i.e. Video Swin Transformer, on two
autism behaviors datasets (SSBD and ESBD) and show that it can achieve high
accuracy and outperform the previous methods by a large margin, demonstrating
the feasibility of vision-based problem behaviors recognition. Moreover, we
propose language-assisted training to further enhance the action recognition
performance. Specifically, we develop a two-branch multimodal deep learning
framework by incorporating the ""freely available"" language description for each
type of problem behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating
additional language supervision can bring an obvious performance boost for the
autism problem behaviors recognition task as compared to using the video

that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision
making. (1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification
for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear
plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a
plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly
non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such
interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the
justification. (2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to
be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification
task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. (3) Federated
learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive
personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the
centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the
federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by
exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative
review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and
state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.

utilizing the redundancy of a large Hilbert space, where an error, once it

logical qubit is encoded in some discrete variables, e.g., photon numbers. Such
encoding schemes make the codewords orthogonal, so that the encoded quantum
information can be unambiguously extracted after processing. Based on such
discrete-variable encodings, repetitive QEC demonstrations have been reported
on various platforms, but there the lifetime of the encoded logical qubit is
still shorter than that of the best available physical qubit in the entire

new information can be discovered (e.g., new images are generated in the case
of SGMs) while original information is first perturbed and then recovered to
its original form. However, SGMs and our BSPMs deal with different types of

fundamental discrepancies. Therefore, our BSPMs have different forms from SGMs.
In addition, our concept not only theoretically subsumes many existing
collaborative filtering models but also outperforms them in terms of Recall and
NDCG in the three benchmark datasets, Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-book. In
addition, the processing time of our method is comparable to other fast

relationship is a generalizable notion of a manipulation task that can transfer
to new objects in the same category; examples include the relationship between
the pose of a pan relative to an oven or the pose of a mug relative to a mug
rack. We call this task-specific pose relationship ""cross-pose"" and provide a
mathematical definition of this concept. We propose a vision-based system that
learns to estimate the cross-pose between two objects for a given manipulation
task using learned cross-object correspondences. The estimated cross-pose is
then used to guide a downstream motion planner to manipulate the objects into
the desired pose relationship (placing a pan into the oven or the mug onto the
mug rack). We demonstrate our method's capability to generalize to unseen
objects, in some cases after training on only 10 demonstrations in the real
world. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in
both simulated and real-world experiments across a number of tasks.

theory and computer science. In this paper, we introduce an edge-analog of the
classical dominant metric dimension of graphs. By combining the concepts of a
vertex-edge dominating set and an edge resolving set, we introduce the notion
of a vertex-edge dominant edge resolving set of a graph. We call the minimum
cardinality of such a set in a graph $\G$, the vertex-edge dominant edge metric
dimension $\g_{emd}(\G)$ of $\G$. The new parameter $\g_{emd}$ is calculated
for some common families such as paths, cycles, complete bipartite graphs,
wheel and fan graphs. We also calculate $\g_{emd}$ for some Cartesian products
of path with path and path with cycle. Importantly, some general results and
bounds are presented for this new parameter. We also conduct a comparative
analysis of $\g_{emd}$ with the dominant metric dimension of graphs. Comparison
shows that these two parameters are not comparable, in general. Upon
considering the class of bipartite graphs, we show that $\g_{emd}(T_n)$ of a
tree $T_n$ is always less than or equal to its dominant metric dimension.
However, we show that for non-tree bipartite graphs, the parameter is not
comparable just like general graphs. Based on the results in this paper, we
propose some open problems at the end.

many homothets of $C$ are required to cover $S$ if no homothet is allowed to

degenerate, the answer to both questions is $\Theta_d(\frac{|S|}{k})$, where
the hidden constant is independent of $d$. This is optimal up to a
multiplicative constant. Analogous results hold in the case of measures. Then
we introduce a generalization of the standard covering and packing densities of
a convex body $C$ to Borel measure spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and, using the

the spin alignment signal is $\sim 2.4 \times$ weaker than seen in previous

This paper proposes a computationally efficient matrix formulation of the

coefficients in two consecutive iterations are explicitly connected through the
matrix formulation, in contrast to the implicit iterative relationship in the
original iNavFIter. By so doing, it allows a straightforward algorithmic
implementation and a number of matrix factors can be pre-calculated for more
efficient computation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
iNavFIter-M algorithm is able to achieve the same high computation accuracy as
the original iNavFIter does, at the computational cost comparable to the

when interactions between macroscopic systems and microscopic quantum ones go
into action. Among various issues, quantum heat engines, in particular, have
attracted much attention as a critical step in theoretical formulation of
quantum thermodynamics and investigation of efficient use of heat by means of
quantum resources. In the present paper, we focus on heat absorption and
emission processes as well as work extraction processes of a quantum Otto
cycle. We describe the former as non-Markovian dynamics, and thereby find that
the interaction energy between a macroscopic heat bath and a microscopic qubit
is not negligible. Specifically, we reveal that the interaction energy is
divided into the system and the bath in a region of the short interaction time
and remains negative in the region of the long interaction time. In addition, a
counterintuitive energy flow from the system and the interaction energy to the
hot bath occurs in another region of the short interaction time. We quantify
these effects by defining an index of non-Markovianity in terms of the
interaction energy. With this behavior of the interaction energy, we show that
a non-Markovian quantum Otto cycle can switch functions such as an engine as
well as a heater or a heat pump by controlling the interaction time with the
heat bath. In particular, the qubit itself loses its energy if we shorten the
interaction time, and in this sense, the qubit is cooled through the cycle.
This property has a possibility of being utilized for cooling the qubits in
quantum computing. We also describe the work extraction from the microscopic
system to a macroscopic system like us humans as an indirect measurement
process by introducing a work storage as a new reservoir.

paper, we present a detailed study of fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC),
paying special attention to asymptotic states, by linear stability analysis and
local simulations with a periodic boundary condition. We find that asymptotic
states can be characterized by two key properties of FFC: (1) the conservation
of lepton number for each flavor of neutrinos and (2) the disappearance of
ELN(electron neutrino-lepton number)-XLN(heavy-leptonic one) angular crossings
in the spatial- or time-averaged distributions. The system which initially has
the positive (negative) ELN-XLN density reaches a flavor equipartition in the
negative (positive) ELN-XLN angular directions, and the other part compensates
it to preserve the conservation laws. These properties of FFCs offer an
approximate scheme determining the survival probability of neutrinos in
asymptotic states without solving quantum kinetic equations. We also
demonstrate that the total amount of flavor conversion can vary with
species-dependent neutrino distributions for identical ELN-XLN ones. Our
results suggest that even shallow or narrow ELN angular crossings have the
ability to drive large flavor conversion, exhibiting the need for including the
effects of FFCs in the modeling of CCSN and BNSM.

this spirit, this paper studies how hackers can effectively launch the
so-called 'targeted node attacks', in which iterative attacks are staged on a

existing attacks for weighted networks, the node importance is typically
measured by the centralities related to shortest-path lengths, and the attack
effectiveness is also measured mostly by length-related metrics. However, this
paper argues that flows can better reflect network functioning than
shortest-path lengths for those networks with carrying traffic as the main
functionality. Thus, this paper proposes metrics based on flows for measuring
the node importance and the attack effectiveness, respectively. Our node
importance metrics include three flow-based centralities (flow betweenness,
current-flow betweenness and current-flow closeness), which have not been

experiments. The spin diffusion in non-uniform magnetic fields causes
broadening of the resonance and limits the sensitivity and the spectral

observation of the parity-time ($PT$) phase transition of diffusive spins in
gradient magnetic fields, we show that the spatial degrees of freedom of atoms
could become a resource, rather than harmfulness, for high-precision
measurement of weak signals. In the normal phase with zero or low gradient
fields, the diffusion results in dissipation of spin precession. However, by
increasing the field gradient, the spin system undergoes a $PT$ transition, and
enters the $PT$ symmetry broken phase. In this novel phase, the spin precession
frequency splits due to spatial localization of the eigenmodes. We demonstrate
that, using these spatial-motion-induced split frequencies, the spin system can
serve as a stable magnetometer, whose output is insensitive to the inevitable
long-term drift of control parameters. This opens a door to detect extremely

suggested by the absence of gravitational images. The HI absorption line is

to the HI peak. The 1612 MHz line is lost due to radio interferences. The OH
1667 MHz main line is tentatively detected in absorption, but not the 1665 MHz
one. Over 30 years, a high variability is observed in optical depths, due to
the rapid changes of the line of sight, caused by the superluminal motions of
the radio knots. The HI line has varied by 20 per cent in depth, while the
OH-1720 MHz depth has varied by a factor 4. The position of the central

of absorption lines from the nuclear regions are expected up to 250 km/S. The
narrowness of the observed lines (< 15 km/s) suggest that the absorption comes
from an outer gas ring, as frequently observed in S0 galaxies. The millimetric
lines are even narrower (< 1 km/s), which corresponds to the continuum size
restricted to the core. The core source is covered by individual 1 pc molecular
clouds, of column density a few 10^22 cm-2, which is compatible with the gas

ionization of these elements occurs within the chromosphere. Therefore, this
phenomenon is intimately tied to the plasma state in the chromosphere and the
corona. In addition, the chromosphere is a highly complex region with a large
variation in the ion-neutral collision frequencies, and hydrogen and helium
ionization is largely out of equilibrium. For this study, we combine IRIS
observations, a single fluid 2.5D radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of
the solar atmosphere, including ion-neutral interaction effects and
non-equilibrium (NEQ) ionization effects, and a novel multi-fluid multi-species
(MFMS) numerical code (Ebysus). Nonthermal velocities of Si IV measured from
IRIS spectra can provide an upper limit for the strength of any high-frequency
Alfven waves. With the single-fluid model, we investigate the possible impact
of NEQ ionization within the region where the FIP may occur and the plasma
properties in those regions. These models suggest that regions with strong
enhanced network and type II spicules are associated with the presence of large
ponderomotive forces. From the plasma properties from the single-fluid MHD
model and IRIS observations, we initialize our multi-fluid models to
investigate the multi-fluid effects on the ponderomotive force associated with
Alfven waves. Our multi-fluid analysis reveals that collisions and NEQ
ionization effects dramatically impact the behavior of the ponderomotive force
in the chromosphere, and existing theories may need to be revisited.

the authors developed a new method - Object reconstruction using
K-approximation (ORKA) - to extract such objects out of given data. In this
method a special object model is used where the movement and deformation of the
object can be controlled to fit the application. ORKA in its current form is
highly dependent on the data resolution. On the one hand, the movement of the
object can only be reconstructed on a grid that depends on the data resolution.
On the other hand, the runtime increases exponentially with the resolution.
Hence, the resolution of the data needs to be in a small range where the
reconstruction is accurate enough but the runtime is not too high. In this
work, we present a multiresolution approach, where we combine ORKA with a
wavelet decomposition of the data. The object is then reconstructed iteratively
what drastically reduces the runtime. Moreover, we can increase the data
resolution such that the movement reconstruction no longer depends on the
original grid. We also give a brief introduction on the original ORKA

Existing methods relying on temporal inconsistencies for DF detection present

These shortcomings are partially due to error-prone motion estimation and
landmark tracking, or the susceptibility of the pixel intensity-based features
to spatial distortions and the cross-dataset domain shifts. Our key insight to
overcome these issues is to leverage the temporal phase variations in the
band-pass components of the Complex Steerable Pyramid on face sub-regions. This
not only enables a robust estimate of the temporal dynamics in these regions,
but is also less prone to cross-dataset variations. Furthermore, the band-pass

excellent results, they typically require a sizable set of high-quality <text,

the world still lack the training data needed to develop TTS systems. This
paper proposes two improvement methods for the two problems faced by
low-resource Mongolian speech synthesis: a) In view of the lack of high-quality
<text, audio> pairs of data, it is difficult to model the mapping problem from
linguistic features to acoustic features. Improvements are made using
pre-trained VITS model and transfer learning methods. b) In view of the problem
of less labeled information, this paper proposes to use an automatic prosodic
annotation method to label the prosodic information of text and corresponding
speech, thereby improving the naturalness and intelligibility of low-resource
Mongolian language. Through empirical research, the N-MOS of the method
proposed in this paper is 4.195, and the I-MOS is 4.228.

helium nanodroplets (HNDs) reveal a strong enrichment of the heavy isotope
$^{22}$Ne that depends on cluster size s and the experimental conditions. For
small sizes the enrichment is much larger than previously reported for bare
neon clusters grown in nozzle expansions and subsequently ionized. The
enrichment is traced to the massive evaporation of neon atoms in a collision
cell that is used to strip helium from the HNDs. We derive a relation between
the enrichment of $^{22}$Ne in the cluster ion and its corresponding depletion
factor $F$ in the vapor phase. The value thus found for $F$ is in excellent
agreement with a theoretical expression that relates isotopic fractionation in
two-phase equilibria of atomic gases to the Debye temperature. Furthermore, the
difference in zero-point energies between the two isotopes computed from F
agrees reasonably well with theoretical studies of neon cluster ions that
include nuclear quantum effects in the harmonic approximation. Another fitting
parameter provides an estimate for the size s$_i$ of the precursor of the
observed Ne$_s^+$. The value is in satisfactory agreement with the size
estimated by modeling the growth of Ne$_s^+$, and with lower and upper limits
deduced from other experimental data. On the other hand, neon clusters grown in
neutral HNDs that are subsequently ionized by electron bombardment exhibit no
statistically significant isotope enrichment at all. The finding suggests that
the extent of ionization-induced dissociation of clusters embedded in HNDs is
considerably smaller than for bare clusters.

general principles and the picture behind the BMR and the ASMR that do not

hysteresis loops, common for most magnetic materials with coercivities. 2) The
magnetoresistance of the magnetic structures in a large positive magnetic field

generalized Ohm's law in magnetic materials, these principles explain why most

performing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow simulations in pipes for very small
values of magnetic Reynolds numbers $R_m$. In some previous works, most lattice
Boltzmann simulations are performed with values of $R_m$ close to the Reynolds
numbers for flows in simplified rectangular geometries. One of the reasons is
the limitation of some traditional lattice Boltzmann algorithms in dealing with
situations involving very small magnetic diffusion time scales associated with
most industrial applications in MHD, which require the use of the so-called
quasi-static (QS) approximation. Another reason is related to the significant
dependence that many boundary conditions methods for lattice Boltzmann have on
the relaxation time parameter. In this work, to overcome the mentioned
limitations, we introduce an improved simplified algorithm for velocity and
magnetic fields which is able to directly solve the equations of the QS
approximation, among other systems, without preconditioning procedures. In
these algorithms, the effects of solid insulating boundaries are included by
using an improved explicit immersed boundary algorithm, whose accuracy is not
affected by the values of $R_m$. Some validations with classic benchmarks and
the analysis of the energy balance in examples including uniform and
non-uniform magnetic fields are shown in this work. Furthermore, a progressive
transition between the scenario described by the QS approximation and the MHD
canonical equations in pipe flows is visualized by studying the evolution of
the magnetic energy balance in examples with unsteady flows.

the web can greatly benefit realistic web applications, e.g. multimodal
retrieval and recommendation. However, existing models suffer from the problem
of generating ``over-generic'' descriptions, such as their tendency to generate
repetitive sentences with common concepts for different images. These generic
descriptions fail to provide sufficient textual semantics for ever-changing web
images. Inspired by the recent success of Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP)
models that learn diverse image-text concept alignment during pretraining, we
explore leveraging their cross-modal pre-trained knowledge to automatically
enrich the textual semantics of image descriptions. With no need for additional
human annotations, we propose a plug-and-play framework, i.e CapEnrich, to
complement the generic image descriptions with more semantic details.
Specifically, we first propose an automatic data-building strategy to get
desired training sentences, based on which we then adopt prompting strategies,
i.e. learnable and template prompts, to incentivize VLP models to generate more
textual details. For learnable templates, we fix the whole VLP model and only
tune the prompt vectors, which leads to two advantages: 1) the pre-training
knowledge of VLP models can be reserved as much as possible to describe diverse
visual concepts; 2) only lightweight trainable parameters are required, so it
is friendly to low data resources. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves the descriptiveness and diversity of generated sentences
for web images. The code is available at https://github.com/yaolinli/CapEnrich.

challenging task for visual scene understanding. Owing to its low cost and high
efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising
application prospects. However, accurately detecting objects through
perspective views is extremely difficult due to the lack of depth information.
Current approaches tend to adopt heavy backbones for image encoders, making
them inapplicable for real-world deployment. Different from the images, LiDAR
points are superior in providing spatial cues, resulting in highly precise
localization. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of LiDAR-based
detectors for multi-view 3D object detection. Instead of directly training a
depth prediction network, we unify the image and LiDAR features in the
Bird-Eye-View (BEV) space and adaptively transfer knowledge across
non-homogenous representations in a teacher-student paradigm. To this end, we
propose \textbf{BEVDistill}, a cross-modal BEV knowledge distillation (KD)
framework for multi-view 3D object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms current KD approaches on a
highly-competitive baseline, BEVFormer, without introducing any extra cost in
the inference phase. Notably, our best model achieves 59.4 NDS on the nuScenes
test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art in comparison with various
image-based detectors. Code will be available at

conducted a global survey to study their effects in practice, and measure

found that 13 of the 14 DevOps practices are adopted, determined by 50\% of the
participants indicating that practices are `always', `most of the time', and
'about half of the time' applied. There is a positive correlation between the
adoption of all practices and independently measured maturity. In particular,
practices concerning sandboxes for minimum deployment, test-driven development,

of software delivery and organizational performance are mainly perceived
positive. Yet, DevOps is also considered by some to have a negative impact such
as respondents mentioning the predictability of product delivery has decreased
and work is less fun. Concluding, our detailed overview of DevOps practices
allows more targeted application of DevOps practices to obtain its positive

most of the voice synthesis models still require a large number of audio data
paired with annotated labels (e.g., text transcription and music score) for
training. To this end, we propose a unified framework of synthesizing and
manipulating voice signals from analysis features, dubbed NANSY++. The backbone
network of NANSY++ is trained in a self-supervised manner that does not require
any annotations paired with audio. After training the backbone network, we
efficiently tackle four voice applications - i.e. voice conversion,
text-to-speech, singing voice synthesis, and voice designing - by partially
modeling the analysis features required for each task. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed framework offers competitive advantages such as
controllability, data efficiency, and fast training convergence, while
providing high quality synthesis. Audio samples: tinyurl.com/8tnsy3uc.

within a green fluorescent protein when coupled to a finite-temperature
dielectric environment. Such systems are of significant interest due to their
anomalously long coherence lifetimes compared to other biomolecules. We work
within the spin-boson model and employ the Hierarchical Equations of Motion
formalism which allows for the accounting of the full non-perturbative and
non-Markovian characteristics of the system dynamics. We analyse the level
coherence of independent green fluorescent protein chromophores and the energy
transfer dynamics in homo-dimer green fluorescent proteins, focusing on the
effect of dielectric relaxation on the timescales of these systems. Using the
Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, we generate spectral densities from local
electric susceptibility generated from Poisson's equation and employ a Debye
dielectric model for the solvent environment. For different system
architectures, we identify a number of very striking features in the dynamics
of the chromophore induced by the dielectric relaxation of the environment,
resulting in strong memory effects that extend the coherence lifetime of the
system. Remarkably, the complex architecture of the green fluorescent protein,
which includes a cavity-like structure around the atomic system, is well suited
to preserving the coherences in the homo-dimer system. The system dynamics
generate a dynamical correlation between the coherent energy transfer between
its sub-systems and the entropy production, which can lead to transient
reductions in entropy, a unique feature of the non-Markovian nature of the
system-environment interaction.

  ResNet architecture",,,,,"eess.IV eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, a deep learning color image steganography scheme combining
convolutional autoencoders and ResNet architecture is proposed. Traditional
steganography methods suffer from some critical defects such as low capacity,
security, and robustness. In recent decades, image hiding and image extraction
were realized by autoencoder convolutional neural networks to solve the
aforementioned challenges. The contribution of this paper is introducing a new
scheme for color image steganography inspired by ResNet architecture. The
reverse ResNet architecture is utilized to extract the secret image from the
stego image. In the proposed method, all images are passed through the
prepossess model which is a convolutional deep neural network with the aim of
feature extraction. Then, the operational model generates stego and extracted
images. In fact, the operational model is an autoencoder based on ResNet
structure that produces an image from feature maps. The advantage of proposed
structure is identity of models in embedding and extraction phases. The
performance of the proposed method is studied using COCO and CelebA datasets.
For quantitative comparisons with previous related works, peak signal-to-noise
ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity index (SSIM) and hiding capacity are
evaluated. The experimental results verify that the proposed scheme performs
better than traditional and pervious deep steganography methods. The PSNR and
SSIM are more than 40 dB and 0.98, respectively that implies high
imperceptibility of the proposed method. Also, this method can hide a color
image of the same size in another color image, which can be inferred that the
relative capacity of the proposed method is 8 bits per pixel.

assess their properties with the increase of neutrons in target nucleus, and
compare with other relevant neutron induced reactions. Model calculations of
the cross sections are based on the statistical Hauser-Feshbach model in TALYS

adjusted by the $(n,\alpha)$ cross section data for $^{54}$Fe and $^{118}$Sn.
The calculations of $(n,\alpha)$ reactions in Fe and Sn isotopes provide the
insight into their isospin dependence and properties over the complete relevant
range of neutron energies. The results show the evolution of the cross sections
with pronounced maxima at low-mass isotopes, and rather strong decrease for
neutron-rich nuclei consistent with the reduction of the reaction $Q$-value and
increased contributions from other exit channels from compound nucleus. The
analysis of the Maxwellian averaged cross sections at temperatures in stellar

low-mass isotopes, in neutron induced reactions with nuclei with neutron

uplift payments to the market players are introduced as part of the pricing
principle. Given the general pricing principle that involves the lost profit
compensation in the form of the uplift payments, we study a question if it is
possible to introduce new products/services at the market and the associated
prices such that the set of the optimal solutions to the centralized dispatch
optimization problem is unaffected, the profit received by each market player
at the centralized dispatch schedule is unchanged, and no market player has
lost profit. These new products/services and the corresponding prices can be
viewed as originating from the Lagrangian relaxation of redundant constraints,
which dot not change the centralized dispatch schedule. For any given market
price (or a pricing algorithm that sets the producer revenue as a function of
its output volume) in a uninode multi-period power market with fixed load, we
explicitly construct a family of the redundant constraints that do not change
the maximum profit of any producer and result in zero total uplift payment. The

CONGEST model of distributed computing. Despite extensive research in this
area, our understanding of the vertex connectivity of a graph is still
incomplete, especially in the distributed setting. To this date, all
distributed algorithms for detecting cut vertices suffer from an inherent
dependency in the maximum degree of the graph, $\Delta$. Hence, in particular,
there is no truly sub-linear time algorithm for this problem, not even for
detecting a single cut vertex. We take a new algorithmic approach for vertex
connectivity which allows us to bypass the existing $\Delta$ barrier. As a
warm-up to our approach, we show a simple $\widetilde{O}(D)$-round randomized
algorithm for computing all cut vertices in a $D$-diameter $n$-vertex graph.
This improves upon the $O(D+\Delta/\log n)$-round algorithm of [Pritchard and
Thurimella, ICALP 2008]. Our key technical contribution is an
$\widetilde{O}(D)$-round randomized algorithm for computing all cut pairs in
the graph, improving upon the state-of-the-art $O(\Delta \cdot D)^4$-round
algorithm by [Parter, DISC '19]. Note that even for the considerably simpler
setting of edge cuts, currently $\widetilde{O}(D)$-round algorithms are known
only for detecting pairs of cut edges. Our approach is based on employing the
well-known linear graph sketching technique [Ahn, Guha and McGregor, SODA 2012]
along with the heavy-light tree decomposition of [Sleator and Tarjan, STOC
1981]. Combining this with a careful characterization of the survivable
subgraphs, allows us to determine the connectivity of $G \setminus \{x,y\}$ for
every pair $x,y \in V$, using $\widetilde{O}(D)$-rounds. We believe that the
tools provided in this paper are useful for omitting the $\Delta$-dependency

identity and holds true under weak integral conditions. Optimal quantitative
stability estimates are obtained in terms of an $L^2$-pseudodistance. In
particular, the optimal stability estimate for Heintze-Karcher's inequality is
new even in the classical case $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^N$.
  Stability bounds in terms of the Hausdorff distance are also provided.
  Several new results are established and exploited, including a new
Poincar\'e-type inequality for vector fields whose normal components vanish on
a portion of the boundary and an explicit (possibly weighted) trace theory --
relative to the cone $\Sigma$ -- for harmonic functions satisfying a
homogeneous Neumann condition on the portion of the boundary contained in
$\partial \Sigma$.
  We also introduce new notions of uniform interior and exterior sphere
conditions relative to the cone $\Sigma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$, which allow to
obtain (via barrier arguments) uniform lower and upper bounds for the gradient
in the mixed boundary value-setting. In the particular case $\Sigma =
\mathbb{R}^N$, these conditions return the classical uniform interior and
exterior sphere conditions (together with the associated classical gradient
bounds of the Dirichlet setting).

formalism. The resulting dispersion at the merging point exhibits semi-Dirac
behavior which is quadratic in the $x$-direction and linear in the
$y$-direction. We find that the combined effects of the intrinsic anisotropic
spectrum, Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment (OMM) lead to finite NL
conductivities in the system. We obtain exact analytical expressions of linear
and second-order NL conductivities which allow us to analyze their dependence
on Fermi energy and system gap parameter $\delta_0$. The topology of the Fermi
surface for $\delta_0>0$ changes from two disjoint Fermi contours to a single
one across a saddle point as the Fermi energy is increased. This feature is
reflected in the nature of obtained conductivities through a kink in their
variations with Fermi energy. We find that the geometric mean (ratio) of Drude
conductivities along the $x$ and $y$ directions is independent of $\delta_0$
for low (high) doping. Interestingly, we show that the ratio of the anomalous
velocity and Lorentz force-induced NL Hall conductivity to the NL anomalous
Hall conductivity is independent of $\delta_0$ and inversely related to Fermi
energy only. For current along the $x$-direction, the NL longitudinal and Hall
resistivities show $B$-linear and $B^0$ dependences respectively in the lowest
order of $B$. However, for current along the $y$-direction, the longitudinal NL
resistivity has no contribution in both zeroth and linear order of $B$ while
the NL Hall resistivity is $B$-linear. The anisotropy in the nature of

on ASC results on the compound DIO and on mixtures with RM734. Both compounds
exhibit a low-temperature ferroelectric nematic phase (NF) and a
high-temperature paraelectric nematic (N). In DIO these two phases are
separated by an intermediate phase (Nx). Detailed data of h(T) and cp(T),
indicated that the intermediate phase was present in all mixtures over the
complete composition range, albeit with strongly decreasing temperature width
with decreasing mole fraction of DIO (xDIO). The xDIO dependence of the two
transitions could be well described by a quadratic function and both
transitions were weakly first order. The true latent heat of the Nx-N
transition of DIO was as low as 0.0075 +/- 0.0005 J/g and 0.23 +/- 0.03 J/g for
the NF-Nx transition, about twice the previously reported value of 0.115 J/g

decrease gradually with decreasing xDIO. At all the Nx-N transitions
pretransition fluctuation effects are absent and these transitions are purely
but very weakly first order. As in RM734 the transition from the NF to the
higher temperature phase exhibits substantial pretransitional behaviour. Power
law analysis of cp(T) resulted in an effective critical exponent of 0.88 +/-
0.10 for DIO and this value decreased in mixtures with decreasing xDIO towards
0.50 +/- 0.05 reported for RM734. Ideal mixture analysis of the phase diagram

effects in the charge diffusion current, the nature of which depends on the
particular values of the electrical conductivity and the charge-diffusion

chemically active particle near the threshold for spontaneous motion. Building
on the steady theory developed in part I of this series, we match a weakly
nonlinear expansion valid on the particle scale with a leading-order
approximation in a larger-scale unsteady remote region, where the particle acts
as a moving point source of diffusing concentration. The resulting amplitude
equation for the velocity of the particle includes a term representing the
interaction of the particle with its own concentration wake in the remote
region, which can be expressed as a time integral over the history of the
particle motion, allowing efficient simulation and theoretical analysis of
fully three-dimensional unsteady problems. To illustrate how to use the model,
we study the effects of a weak force acting on the particle, including the
stability of the steady states and how the velocity vector realigns towards the
stable one, neither of which previous axisymmetric and steady models were able
to capture. This unsteady formulation could also be applied to most of the
other perturbation scenarios studied in part I as well as the dynamics of
interacting active particles.

requires taking full advantage of visual representation along with the
generation process. Existing video captioning methods focus on making an
exploration of spatial-temporal representations and their relationships to
produce inferences. However, such methods only exploit the superficial
association contained in the video itself without considering the intrinsic
visual commonsense knowledge that existed in a video dataset, which may hinder
their capabilities of knowledge cognitive to reason accurate descriptions. To
address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, called Visual
Commonsense-aware Representation Network (VCRN), for video captioning.
Specifically, we construct a Video Dictionary, a plug-and-play component,
obtained by clustering all video features from the total dataset into multiple
clustered centers without additional annotation. Each center implicitly
represents a visual commonsense concept in the video domain, which is utilized
in our proposed Visual Concept Selection (VCS) to obtain a video-related
concept feature. Next, a Conceptual Integration Generation (CIG) is proposed to
enhance the caption generation. Extensive experiments on three publicly video
captioning benchmarks: MSVD, MSR-VTT, and VATEX, demonstrate that our method
reaches state-of-the-art performance, indicating the effectiveness of our
method. In addition, our approach is integrated into the existing method of
video question answering and improves this performance, further showing the
generalization of our method. Source code has been released at

Earth-like biosphere and one may conjecture that plate-tectonics planets should
be similar in geological properties. After all, the volume of continental crust
evolves towards an equilibrium between production and erosion. If the interior
thermal states of Earth-sized exoplanets are similar to the Earth's, one might
expect a similar equilibrium between continental production and erosion to
establish and, hence, a similar land fraction. We will show that this
conjecture is not likely to be true. Positive feedback associated with the
coupled mantle water - continental crust cycle may rather lead to a manifold of
three possible planets, depending on their early history: a land planet, an
ocean planet and a balanced Earth-like planet. In addition, thermal blanketing
of the interior by the continents enhances the sensitivity of continental
growth to its history and, eventually, to initial conditions. Much of the
blanketing effect is however compensated by mantle depletion in radioactive
elements. A model of the long-term carbonate-silicate cycle shows the land and
the ocean planet to differ by about 5 K in average surface temperature. A
larger continental surface fraction results both in higher weathering rates and
enhanced outgassing, partly compensating each other. Still, the land planet is
expected to have a substantially dryer, colder and harsher climate possibly
with extended cold deserts in comparison with the ocean planet and with the
present-day Earth. Using a model of balancing water availability and nutrients
from continental crust weathering, we find the bioproductivity and the biomass
of both the land and ocean planet to be reduced by a third to half of Earth's.
The biosphere on these planets might not be substantial enough to produce a
supply of free oxygen.

Within that, an important high dimensional expansion notion is \emph{cosystolic
expansion}, which has found applications in the construction of efficiently

  Cosystolic expansion is considered with systems of equations over a group
where the variables and equations correspond to faces of the complex. Previous
works that studied cosystolic expansion were tailored to the specific group
$\mathbb{F}_2$. In particular, Kaufman, Kazhdan and Lubotzky (FOCS 2014), and
Evra and Kaufman (STOC 2016) in their breakthrough works, who solved a famous
open question of Gromov, have studied a notion which we term ``parity''
expansion for small sets. They showed that small sets of $k$-faces have
proportionally many $(k+1)$-faces that contain \emph{an odd number} of
$k$-faces from the set. Parity expansion for small sets could be used to imply
cosystolic expansion only over $\mathbb{F}_2$.

previous works.
  We then show, utilizing the new unique-neighbor-like expansion notion
introduced in this work, that cosystolic expansion can be made
\emph{group-independent}, i.e., unique-neighbor-like expansion for small sets
implies cosystolic expansion \emph{over any group}.

  Low-quality Point Clouds","Need to modify",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The curve skeleton is an important shape descriptor that has been utilized in
various applications in computer graphics, machine vision, and artificial
intelligence. In this study, the endpoint-based part-aware curve skeleton
(EPCS) extraction method for low-quality point clouds is proposed. The novel
random center shift (RCS) method is first proposed for detecting the endpoints
on point clouds. The endpoints are used as the initial seed points for dividing
each part into layers, and then the skeletal points are obtained by computing
the center points of the oriented bounding box (OBB) of the layers.
Subsequently, the skeletal points are connected, thus forming the branches.
Furthermore, the multi-vector momentum-driven (MVMD) method is also proposed
for locating the junction points that connect the branches. Due to the shape
differences between different parts on point clouds, the global topology of the
skeleton is finally optimized by removing the redundant junction points,
re-connecting some branches using the proposed MVMD method, and applying an
interpolation method based on the splitting operator. Consequently, a complete
and smooth curve skeleton is achieved. The proposed EPCS method is compared
with several state-of-the-art methods, and the experimental results verify its
robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency. Furthermore, the skeleton extraction
and model segmentation results on the point clouds of broken Terracotta also
highlight the utility of the proposed method.

macromolecules (cargo) and membrane proteins in cells. In yeast cells, this
involves the invagination of a tubular structure on the membrane and the
formation of endocytic vesicles. Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins holding a
crescent-shape are generally assumed to be the active player to squeeze the
tubular structure and pinch off the vesicle by forming a scaffold on the side
of the tubular membrane. Here we use the extended Helfrich model to
theoretically investigate how BAR proteins help drive the formation of vesicles
via generating anisotropic curvatures. Our results show that, within the
classical Helfrich model, increasing the spontaneous curvature at the side of a
tubular membrane is unable to reduce the tube radius to a critical size to
induce membrane fission. However, membranes coated with proteins that generate
anisotropic curvatures are prone to experience an hourglass-shaped necking or a
tube-shaped necking process, an important step leading to membrane fission and
vesicle formation. In addition, our study shows that depending on the type of
anisotropic curvatures generated by a protein, the force to maintain the
protein coated membrane at a tubular shape exhibits qualitatively different
relationship with the spontaneous curvature. This result provides an
experimental guidance to determine the type of anisotropic curvatures of a
protein.

conventional propulsion systems, the amount of storable propellant limits the
maximum mission lifetime. The latter can be avoided by employing
Atmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP) system, which collects the
residual atmospheric particles and uses them as propellant for an electric

Mars as well as refuelling and space tug missions. The results show that the
ABEP system is not only able to compensate drag for orbit maintenance but also
capable of performing orbital maneuvers and collect propellant for applications

develop an alternative Kaluza-Klein formalism in the framework of elasticity

Cauchy formula for these type of functions is the starting point of the
$S$-functional calculus. In the second step a monogenic function is obtained by
applying the Laplace operator in four real variables, namely $ \Delta$, to a
slice hyperholomorphic function. The polyanalytic functional calculus, that we
study in this paper, is based on the factorization of $\Delta= \mathcal{D}
\mathcal{\overline{D}}$. Instead of applying directly the Laplace operator to a
slice hyperholomorphic function we apply first the operator $
\mathcal{\overline{D}}$ and we get a polyanalytic function of order 2, i..e, a
function that belongs to the kernel of $ \mathcal{D}^2$. We can represent this
type of functions in an integral form and then we can define the polyanalytic
functional calculus on $S$-spectrum. The main goal of this paper is to show the
principal properties of this functional calculus. In particular, we study a
resolvent equation suitable for proving a product rule and generate the Riesz
projectors.

spatial-temporal data analysis and management. TRL aims to convert complicated
raw trajectories into low-dimensional representation vectors, which can be
applied to various downstream tasks, such as trajectory classification,
clustering, and similarity computation. Existing TRL works usually treat
trajectories as ordinary sequence data, while some important spatial-temporal
characteristics, such as temporal regularities and travel semantics, are not
fully exploited. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Self-supervised
trajectory representation learning framework with TemporAl Regularities and
Travel semantics, namely START. The proposed method consists of two stages. The
first stage is a Trajectory Pattern-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (TPE-GAT),
which converts the road network features and travel semantics into
representation vectors of road segments. The second stage is a Time-Aware
Trajectory Encoder (TAT-Enc), which encodes representation vectors of road
segments in the same trajectory as a trajectory representation vector,
meanwhile incorporating temporal regularities with the trajectory
representation. Moreover, we also design two self-supervised tasks, i.e.,
span-masked trajectory recovery and trajectory contrastive learning, to
introduce spatial-temporal characteristics of trajectories into the training
process of our START framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
verified by extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets for
three downstream tasks. The experiments also demonstrate that our method can be
transferred across different cities to adapt heterogeneous trajectory datasets.

proximal policy optimisation algorithm, the reinforcement agent is trained to
optimally set the lengths and the spacing of an array of resonators. The design
optimisation problem is formalised in a Markov decision problem by splitting
the optimisation procedure into a discrete number of decisions. Being the
physics of graded metamaterials governed by the spatial distribution of local
resonances, the space of possible configurations is constrained by using a
continuous function for the resonators arrangement. A preliminary analytical
investigation has been performed to characterise the dispersive properties of
the analysed system by treating it as a locally resonant system. The outcomes
of the optimisation procedure confirms the results of previous investigations,
highlighting both the validity of the proposed approach and the robustness of
the systems of graded resonators when employed for mechanical energy
confinement and amplification. The role of the resonator spacing is shown to be
secondary with respect to the resonator lengths or, in other words, with
respect to the oscillation frequencies of the resonators. However, it is also
demonstrated that reducing the number of resonators can be advantageous. The
outcomes related to the joint optimisation of the resonator lengths and
spacing, thanks also to the adaptive control of the analysis duration, overcome
significantly the performance of previously known systems by working almost
uniquely on enlarging the time in which the harvester oscillations take place
without amplifying these oscillations. The proposed procedure is suitable to be
applied to a wide range of design optimisation problems in which the effect of
the design choices can be assessed through numerical simulations.

to their powerful capability to use flexible self-attention mechanism. However,

Specifically, we empirically investigate how different position encoding

observe that ROIs are sensitive to the position encoding strategies. Motivated
by this, we present a novel Hybrid Axial-Attention (HAA), a form of position
self-attention that can be equipped with spatial pixel-wise information and
relative position information as inductive bias. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism to alleviate the burden of training schedule, resulting in
efficient feature selection over small-scale datasets. Experiments on the BraTS

sensory data to provide awareness about the communication environment and
proactively predict dynamic link blockages before they occur. This allows the
network to make proactive decisions for hand-off/beam switching, enhancing the
network reliability and latency. More specifically, this paper addresses the
following key questions: (i) Can we predict a line-of-sight link blockage,
before it happens, using in-band mmWave/THz signal and LiDAR sensing data? (ii)
Can we also predict when this blockage will occur? (iii) Can we predict the
blockage duration? And (iv) can we predict the direction of the moving
blockage? For that, we develop machine learning solutions that learn special
patterns of the received signal and sensory data, which we call
\textit{pre-blockage signatures}, to infer future blockages. To evaluate the
proposed approaches, we build a large-scale real-world dataset that comprises
co-existing LiDAR and mmWave communication measurements in outdoor vehicular

applies some pre-processing to the LiDAR data. Based on the real-world dataset,
the developed approaches are shown to achieve above 95\% accuracy in predicting
blockages occurring within 100 ms and more than 80\% prediction accuracy for

conflicting requirements of different nodes sharing the same network resources.
In this paper, we leverage the I-CSI of multiple eMBB links and the channel
measurement's history of a URLLC user for multi-antenna beamforming design.
Specifically, we propose a precoding design that minimizes the transmit power
of a base station (BS) providing eMBB and URLLC services with
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and outage constraints,
respectively, by modifying existing I-CSI-based precoding schemes to account
for URLLC channel history information. Moreover, we illustrate and validate the
proposed method by adopting zero-forcing (ZF) and the transmit power
minimization (TPM) precoding with SINR constraints. We show that the ZF
implementation outperforms TPM in adverse channel conditions as in Rayleigh
fading, while the situation is rapidly reversed as the channel experiences some
line-of-sight (LOS). Finally, we determine the confidence levels at which the
target outage probabilities are reached. For instance, we show that outage
probabilities below $10^{-3}$ are achievable with more than 99$\%$ confidence
for both precoding schemes under favorable LOS conditions with 16 transmit

Additionally, most of these methods, being data-intensive, cannot be supported
by a metal AM alloy or system due to budget restrictions. To tackle this issue,
the article introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodology transformed
into an optimization problem in the realm of metal AM. An off-policy RL
framework based on Q-learning is proposed to find optimal laser power ($P$) -
scan velocity ($v$) combinations with the objective of maintaining steady-state
melt pool depth. For this, an experimentally validated Eagar-Tsai formulation
is used to emulate the Laser-Directed Energy Deposition environment, where the
laser operates as the agent across the $P-v$ space such that it maximizes
rewards for a melt pool depth closer to the optimum. The culmination of the
training process yields a Q-table where the state ($P,v$) with the highest
Q-value corresponds to the optimized process parameter. The resultant melt pool
depths and the mapping of Q-values to the $P-v$ space show congruence with
experimental observations. The framework, therefore, provides a model-free

dynamic behaviors of nanoscale condensates on different nanopillar surfaces,
and found that there exists an unrevealed domino effect throughout the entire
droplet lifecycle and the coalescence is not the only mechanism to access the
droplet jumping. The vapor nucleation preferentially occurs in structure
intervals, thus the formed liquid embryos incubate and grow in a spatially
confined mode, which stores an excess surface energy and simultaneously
provides a asymmetric Laplace pressure, stimulating the trapped droplets to
undergo a dewetting transition or even a self-jumping, which can be facilitated
by the tall and dense nanostructures. Subsequently, the adjacent droplets merge
mutually and further trigger more multifarious self-propelled behaviors that
are affected by underlying surface nanostructure, including dewetting
transition, coalescence-induced jumping and jumping relay. Moreover, an
improved energy-based model was developed by considering the nano-physical
effects, the theoretical prediction not only extends the coalescence-induced
jumping to the nanometer-sized droplets but also correlates the surface
nanostructure topology to the jumping velocity. Such a cumulative effect of

arm. Using non-concurrent controls can result in bias in the estimate in case
of time trends if the appropriate methodology is not used and the assumptions
are not met. In this paper, we faced two main objectives. In the first, we
aimed to identify the methods currently available for incorporating
non-concurrent controls, clarify the key concepts and assumptions, and name the
main characteristics of each method. For this purpose, we systematically
searched research articles on methods to include non-concurrent controls. The
second objective is to summarise the current regulatory view on non-concurrent
controls to clarify the key concepts and current guidance. Therefore, we
conducted a systematic search in regulatory guidelines regarding using
non-concurrent controls and summarised the most relevant arguments and
recommended methods. Finally, we discuss the advantages and potential caveats
of using non-concurrent controls.

m) beam combiner for the VLTI with the ambitious goal to be sensitive to young
giant exoplanets down to 5 mas separation around nearby stars. The performance
of nulling interferometers in these wavelengths is affected both by fundamental
noise from the background and by the contributions of instrumental noises. This
motivates the development of end-to-end simulations to optimize these
instruments. Aims: To enable the performance evaluation and inform the design
of such instruments on the current and future infrastructures, taking into
account the different sources of noise, and their correlation. Methods:
SCIFYsim is an end-to-end simulator for single mode filtered beam combiners,
with an emphasis on nulling interferometers. It is used to compute a covariance
matrix of the errors. Statistical detection tests based on likelihood ratios
are then used to compute compound detection limits for the instrument. Results:
With the current assumptions on the performance of the wavefront correction
systems, the errors are dominated by correlated instrumental errors down to
stars of magnitude 6-7 in the L band, beyond which thermal background from the
telescopes and relay system becomes dominant. Conclusions: SCIFYsim is suited
to anticipate some of the challenges of design, tuning, operation and signal
processing for integrated optics beam combiners. The detection limits found for
this early version of NOTT simulation with the unit telescopes are compatible
with detections at contrasts up to $10^5$ in the L band at separations of 5 to
80 mas around bright stars.

  UniFormer","24 pages, 4 figures, 20 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning discriminative spatiotemporal representation is the key problem of
video understanding. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown their
power in learning long-term video dependency with self-attention.
Unfortunately, they exhibit limitations in tackling local video redundancy, due
to the blind global comparison among tokens. UniFormer has successfully
alleviated this issue, by unifying convolution and self-attention as a relation
aggregator in the transformer format. However, this model has to require a
tiresome and complicated image-pretraining phrase, before being finetuned on
videos. This blocks its wide usage in practice. On the contrary, open-sourced
ViTs are readily available and well-pretrained with rich image supervision.
Based on these observations, we propose a generic paradigm to build a powerful
family of video networks, by arming the pretrained ViTs with efficient
UniFormer designs. We call this family UniFormerV2, since it inherits the
concise style of the UniFormer block. But it contains brand-new local and
global relation aggregators, which allow for preferable accuracy-computation
balance by seamlessly integrating advantages from both ViTs and UniFormer.
Without any bells and whistles, our UniFormerV2 gets the state-of-the-art
recognition performance on 8 popular video benchmarks, including scene-related
Kinetics-400/600/700 and Moments in Time, temporal-related Something-Something
V1/V2, untrimmed ActivityNet and HACS. In particular, it is the first model to
achieve 90% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400, to our best knowledge. Code will be

commissioned with regulating voltages at fast timescales. Although the IEEE

how to optimally customize them per DER. Optimal rule design (ORD) is a
challenging problem as Volt/VAR rules introduce nonlinear dynamics, require
bilinear optimization models, and lurk trade-offs between stability and
steady-state performance. To tackle ORD, we develop a deep neural network (DNN)
that serves as a digital twin of Volt/VAR dynamics. The DNN takes grid
conditions as inputs, uses rule parameters as weights, and computes equilibrium
voltages as outputs. Thanks to this genuine design, ORD is reformulated as a
deep learning task using grid scenarios as training data and aiming at driving
the predicted variables being the equilibrium voltages close to unity. The
learning task is solved by modifying efficient deep-learning routines to
enforce constraints on rule parameters. In the course of DNN-based ORD, we also
review and expand on stability conditions and convergence rates for Volt/VAR
rules on single-/multi-phase feeders. To benchmark the optimality and runtime
of DNN-based ORD, we also devise a novel mixed-integer nonlinear program
formulation. Numerical tests showcase the merits of DNN-based ORD.

expression is an important prognostic biomarker for breast cancer treatment

due to stain variations between centers and the need to estimate visually the
staining intensity in specific percentages of tumor area. In this paper,
focusing on the interpretability of HER2 scoring by a pathologist, we propose a
semi-automatic, two-stage deep learning approach that directly evaluates the
clinical HER2 guidelines defined by the American Society of Clinical Oncology/
College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP). In the first stage, we segment the
invasive tumor over the user-indicated Region of Interest (ROI). Then, in the
second stage, we classify the tumor tissue into four HER2 classes. For the
classification stage, we use weakly supervised, constrained optimization to
find a model that classifies cancerous patches such that the tumor surface
percentage meets the guidelines specification of each HER2 class. We end the
second stage by freezing the model and refining its output logits in a
supervised way to all slide labels in the training set. To ensure the quality
of our dataset's labels, we conducted a multi-pathologist HER2 scoring
consensus. For the assessment of doubtful cases where no consensus was found,
our model can help by interpreting its HER2 class percentages output. We
achieve a performance of 0.78 in F1-score on the test set while keeping our
model interpretable for the pathologist, hopefully contributing to
interpretable AI models in digital pathology.

evidence of both precession and eccentricity in the signal, which would have
clear implications for the formation channel of the binary. However, since this
short signal consists of only the merger-ringdown portion there is a high
possibility that the parameter estimation might be biased. We find that for a

ease crucial tasks such as crash analysis. Source-level debuggers use this

reason on it even when optimizations alter program structure extensively. A few
recent endeavors have proposed effective methodologies for identifying
incorrect instances of debug information, which can mislead users by presenting
them with an inconsistent program state.
  In this work, we identify and study a related important problem: the
completeness of debug information. Unlike correctness issues for which an
unoptimized executable can serve as reference, we find there is no analogous
oracle to deem when the cause behind an unreported part of program state is an
unavoidable effect of optimization or a compiler implementation defect. In this
scenario, we argue that empirically derived conjectures on the expected
availability of debug information can serve as an effective means to expose
classes of these defects.
  We propose three conjectures involving variable values and study how often
synthetic programs compiled with different configurations of the popular gcc
and LLVM compilers deviate from them. We then discuss techniques to pinpoint
the optimizations behind such violations and minimize bug reports accordingly.

  the 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)",,,,"cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The formal study of coalition formation in multi-agent systems is typically
realized in the framework of hedonic games, which originate from economic
theory. The main focus of this branch of research has been on the existence and
the computational complexity of deciding the existence of coalition structures
that satisfy various stability criteria. The actual process of forming
coalitions based on individual behavior has received little attention. In this
paper, we study the convergence of simple dynamics leading to stable partitions
in a variety of established classes of hedonic games including anonymous,
dichotomous, fractional, and hedonic diversity games. The dynamics we consider
is based on individual stability: an agent will join another coalition if she
is better off and no member of the welcoming coalition is worse off.
  Our results are threefold. First, we identify conditions for the (fast)
convergence of our dynamics. To this end, we develop new techniques based on
the simultaneous usage of multiple intertwined potential functions and
establish a reduction uncovering a close relationship between anonymous hedonic
games and hedonic diversity games. Second, we provide elaborate counterexamples
determining tight boundaries for the existence of individually stable
partitions. Third, we study the computational complexity of problems related to
the coalition formation dynamics. In particular, we settle open problems
suggested by Bogomolnaia and Jackson (2002), Brandl et al. (2005), and Boehmer
and Elkind (2020).

performed in samples machined out of injected plates and cut along three

to capture the anisotropy of the skin-core microstructure, classical in
injected SFRP. Monotonic tensile tests evidenced the stiffening and

with an acuity depending on the matrix ratio and fiber orientation.
Stress-controlled fatigue tests were performed at constant amplitude, frequency

curves of V35 are more affected by aging than those of the V50 material. The
combined results from the mean strain evolutions and SEM observations confirmed

momentum plane, we identify the redshift at which the infant GCs first became
gravitationally bound, and we find evidence of radial infall of their gaseous
and stellar components. The collapse appears to be driven by internal
self-gravity, however, the initial trigger is sourced from the external
environment. The phase space behaviour of the infant GCs also allows us to
identify some characteristic groupings of objects. Such a classification based
on internal properties appears to be reflected in the formation environment: GC
candidates that belong to the same class are found in host galaxies of similar
morphology, with the majority of the infant GCs located in clumpy, irregular
proto-galaxies. Finally, through the inspection of two GC candidates that
contain only stars by z = 6, we find that supernova feedback is the main
physical mechanism behind their dearth of gas and that the systems subsequently
respond with an approximately adiabatic expansion. Such infant GC candidates
already resemble the GCs we currently observe in the local Universe.

joint coordinates with skeletal interconnections. By defining a graph with
joints as vertices and their natural connections as edges, previous works
successfully adopted Graph Convolutional networks (GCNs) to model joint
co-occurrences and achieved superior performance. More recently, a limitation
of GCNs is identified, i.e., the topology is fixed after training. To relax
such a restriction, Self-Attention (SA) mechanism has been adopted to make the
topology of GCNs adaptive to the input, resulting in the state-of-the-art
hybrid models. Concurrently, attempts with plain Transformers have also been
made, but they still lag behind state-of-the-art GCN-based methods due to the
lack of structural prior. Unlike hybrid models, we propose a more elegant
solution to incorporate the bone connectivity into Transformer via a graph
distance embedding. Our embedding retains the information of skeletal structure
during training, whereas GCNs merely use it for initialization. More
importantly, we reveal an underlying issue of graph models in general, i.e.,
pairwise aggregation essentially ignores the high-order kinematic dependencies
between body joints. To fill this gap, we propose a new self-attention (SA)
mechanism on hypergraph, termed Hypergraph Self-Attention (HyperSA), to
incorporate intrinsic higher-order relations into the model. We name the
resulting model Hyperformer, and it beats state-of-the-art graph models w.r.t.

explicitly on the quantum numbers $n$ and $m$, spin parameter $s$, and of four

Besides, we discussed some interesting features of such a spectrum, for
example, its degeneracy, and then we graphically analyze the behavior of the

latest SSL methods use pseudo-labels predicted from a single discriminative

inherent confirmation bias and noise which greatly affects the model
performance. In this work we introduce a new framework for SSL named NorMatch.
Firstly, we introduce a new uncertainty estimation scheme based on normalizing
flows, as an auxiliary classifier, to enforce highly certain pseudo-labels
yielding a boost of the discriminative classifiers. Secondly, we introduce a
threshold-free sample weighting strategy to exploit better both high and low
confidence pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we utilize normalizing flows to model,
in an unsupervised fashion, the distribution of unlabeled data. This modelling
assumption can further improve the performance of generative classifiers via
unlabeled data, and thus, implicitly contributing to training a better
discriminative classifier. We demonstrate, through numerical and visual

low-latency communication (URLLC). An enabling technology for URLLC is massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), which can increase reliability due to
improved user separation, array gain and the channel hardening effect.
Measurements have been performed in an operating factory environment at 3.7 GHz
with a co-located massive MIMO array and a unique randomly distributed array.
Channel hardening can appear when the number of antennas is increased such that
the variations of channel gain (small-scale fading) is decreased and it is here
quantified. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the channel gains
then becomes steeper and its tail is reduced. This CDF is modeled and the
required fading margins are quantified. By deploying a distributed array, the
large-scale power variations can also be reduced, further improving
reliability. The large array in this rich scattering environment, creates a
more reliable channel as it approaches an independent identically distributed
(i.i.d.) complex Gaussian channel, indicating that one can rethink the system
design in terms of e.g. channel coding and re-transmission strategies, in order
to reduce latency. To conclude, massive MIMO is a highly interesting technology

fundamental geometric problem. (By a packing here we mean an arrangement of
disks in a rectangle without overlapping.) We consider the following
algorithmic generalization of the equal disk packing problem. In this problem,
for a given packing of equal disks into a rectangle, the question is whether by
changing positions of a small number of disks, we can allocate space for
packing more disks. More formally, in the repacking problem, for a given set of
$n$ equal disks packed into a rectangle and integers $k$ and $h$, we ask
whether it is possible by changing positions of at most $h$ disks to pack $n+k$
disks. Thus the problem of packing equal disks is the special case of our
problem with $n=h=0$.
  While the computational complexity of packing equal disks into a rectangle
remains open, we prove that the repacking problem is NP-hard already for $h=0$.
Our main algorithmic contribution is an algorithm that solves the repacking
problem in time $(h+k)^{O(h+k)}\cdot |I|^{O(1)}$, where $I$ is the input size.
That is, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by $k$ and $h$.

occasionally binding constraints, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on
short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a

Granger-Johansen representation theorem from a linear to a nonlinear setting,

proof-writing experience, allowing them to drag and drop prewritten proof lines
into the correct order instead of starting from scratch. In this paper we
describe a randomized controlled trial designed to measure the learning gains
of using Proof Blocks for students learning proof by induction. The study
participants were 332 students recruited after completing the first month of
their discrete mathematics course. Students in the study took a pretest and
read lecture notes on proof by induction, completed a brief (less than 1 hour)
learning activity, and then returned one week later to complete the posttest.
Depending on the experimental condition that each student was assigned to, they
either completed only Proof Blocks problems, completed some Proof Blocks
problems and some written proofs, or completed only written proofs for their
learning activity. We find that students in the early phases of learning about
proof by induction are able to learn just as much from reading lecture notes
and using Proof Blocks as by reading lecture notes and writing proofs from
scratch, but in far less time on task. This finding complements previous
findings that Proof Blocks are useful exam questions and are viewed positively
by students.

some of the faces and extremal points. These constructions yield a connection
between the geometry of the correlation matrices and the existence problems of
maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, as well as SIC-POVMs.

Mujoco offline reinforcement learning tasks. Analysis of the internal
representation reveals that the pre-trained Transformers acquire largely
different representations before and after pre-training, but acquire less
information of data in fine-tuning than the randomly initialized one. A closer
look at the parameter changes of the pre-trained Transformers reveals that
their parameters do not change that much and that the bad performance of the
model pre-trained with image data could partially come from large gradients and
gradient clipping. To study what information the Transformer pre-trained with
language data utilizes, we fine-tune this model with no context provided,
finding that the model learns efficiently even without context information.
Subsequent follow-up analysis supports the hypothesis that pre-training with

their narrow focus on the most prominent regions of an image -- revealing
""where"" the model looks, but failing to elucidate ""what"" the model sees in

Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to
anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable
changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our
proposed ""neural"" AIF agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions
on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task
environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of
the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed
that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the
agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate
accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In
addition, we present a novel formulation of the prior function that maps a
multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy.

these methods only take SM into account but do not consider the SM operating
environment. So, this paper discussed the relationship among SM, geological
information, and control terminals. Then, according to the relationship, models
were established for the control terminal, including SM rate prediction and SM
anomaly detection. The experimental results show that compared with baseline
models, the proposed models in this paper perform better. In the proposed
model, the R2 and MSE of rate prediction can reach 92.2\%, and 0.0064
respectively. The abnormal detection rate of anomaly detection is up to 98.2\%.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using LOB data for resolving

out-of-distribution (OOD) LOB data is challenging since distributional shifts
are unlabeled in current publicly available LOB datasets. Therefore, it is
critical to build a synthetic LOB dataset with labeled OOD samples serving as a
testbed for developing models that generalize well to unseen scenarios. In this
work, we utilize a multi-agent market simulator to build a synthetic LOB
dataset, named DSLOB, with and without market stress scenarios, which allows
for the design of controlled distributional shift benchmarking. Using the
proposed synthetic dataset, we provide a holistic analysis on the forecasting
performance of three different state-of-the-art forecasting methods. Our
results reflect the need for increased researcher efforts to develop algorithms

suitable vehicle control when following roads, avoiding obstacles, or taking
specific turns at intersections to reach a destination. Unfortunately,
performance dramatically decreases when deployed to unseen environments and is
inconsistent against varying weather conditions. Most importantly, the current
CIL fails to avoid static road blockages. In this work, we propose a solution
to those deficiencies. First, we fuse the laser scanner with the regular camera
streams, at the features level, to overcome the generalization and consistency
challenges. Second, we introduce a new efficient Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM)
method along with new algorithms for road blockages avoidance and global route

full road blockages, and guides the controlled vehicle to another route to
reach the destination. Following the original CIL work, we demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposal on CARLA simulator urban driving benchmark. Our
experiments showed that our model improved consistency against weather

52%. Furthermore, our global route planner improved the driving success rate by

comprehension and analysis. It is concerned with the documents writing style
and characteristics that distinguish the authors. The diversity of text images,
notably in images with varying handwriting, makes the process of learning good
features difficult in cases where little data is available. In this paper, we
propose a novel scheme to identify the author of a document based on the input
word image. Our method is text independent and does not impose any constraint
on the size of the input image under examination. To begin with, we detect
crucial components in handwriting and extract regions surrounding them using
Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). These patches are designed to capture
individual writing features (including allographs, characters, or combinations
of characters) that are likely to be unique for an individual writer. These
features are then passed through a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in
which the weights are learned by applying the concept of Similarity learning
using Siamese network. Siamese network enhances the discrimination power of CNN
by mapping similarity between different pairs of input image. Features learned
at different scales of the extracted SIFT key-points are encoded using Sparse
PCA, each components of the Sparse PCA is assigned a saliency score signifying
its level of significance in discriminating different writers effectively.
Finally, the weighted Sparse PCA corresponding to each SIFT key-points is
combined to arrive at a final classification score for each writer. The
proposed algorithm was evaluated on two publicly available databases (namely
IAM and CVL) and is able to achieve promising result, when compared with other
deep learning based algorithm.

natural language answer given an image and a natural language question about

natural language processing (NLP), as well as flexible answer prediction for
free-form and open-ended answers. Existing approaches often fail in cases that
require reading and understanding text in images to answer questions. In
practice, they cannot effectively handle the answer sequence derived from text
tokens because the visual features are not text-oriented. To address the above
issues, we propose a Text-Aware Dual Routing Network (TDR) which simultaneously
handles the VQA cases with and without understanding text information in the
input images. Specifically, we build a two-branch answer prediction network
that contains a specific branch for each case and further develop a dual
routing scheme to dynamically determine which branch should be chosen. In the
branch that involves text understanding, we incorporate the Optical Character

monomial $x^2$, i.e., if and only if the commutative presemifield associated to

Under this approach no mesh conformity is required, thus making the method

described by the two-timescale (fast-slow) phytoplankton-zooplankton model

sufficiently fast rise of the water temperature causes a critical transition
from a low phytoplankton concentration to a single outburst: a so-called
plankton bloom. However, the dynamical mechanism responsible for the observed
transition has not been identified to the present day. Using techniques from
geometric singular perturbation theory, we uncover the formerly overlooked
rate-sensitive quasithreshold which is given by special trajectories called
canards. The transition from low to high concentrations occurs when this
rate-sensitive quasithreshold moves past the current state of the plankton
system at some narrow critical range of warming rates. In this way, we identify
rate-induced tipping as the underlying dynamical mechanism. Our findings
explain the previously reported transitions to a single plankton bloom, and
allow us to predict a new type of transition to a sequence of blooms for higher
rates of warming. This could provide a possible mechanism of the observed
increased frequency of harmful algal blooms.
