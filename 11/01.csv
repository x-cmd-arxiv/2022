from sequential data, is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine
learning. CUSUM is a popular statistical method for online change-point
detection due to its efficiency from recursive computation and constant memory
requirement, and it enjoys statistical optimality. CUSUM requires knowing the
precise pre- and post-change distribution. However, post-change distribution is
usually unknown a priori since it represents anomaly and novelty. When there is
a model mismatch with actual data, classic CUSUM can perform poorly. While
likelihood ratio-based methods encounter challenges in high dimensions, neural
networks have become an emerging tool for change-point detection with
computational efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we introduce a neural
network CUSUM (NN-CUSUM) for online change-point detection. We also present a
general theoretical condition when the trained neural networks can perform
change-point detection and what losses can achieve our goal. We further extend
our analysis by combining it with the Neural Tangent Kernel theory to establish
learning guarantees for the standard performance metrics, including the average
run length (ARL) and expected detection delay (EDD). The strong performance of
NN-CUSUM is demonstrated in detecting change-point in high-dimensional data
using both synthetic and real-world data.

scattering reaction: the ionization caused by recoil protons in a hydrogenous
material constitutes the basic information for the design and development of a
class of neutron detectors. Although experimental techniques have continuously
improved, proton-recoil track imaging remains still at the frontier of
n-detection systems, due to the high photon sensitivity required. Several
state-of-the-art approaches for neutron tracking by using n-p single and double
scattering - referred to as Recoil Proton Track Imaging (RPTI) - can be found
in the literature. So far, they have showed limits in terms of detection
efficiency, complexity, cost, and implementation. In order to address some of
these deficiencies, we have proposed RIPTIDE a novel recoil-proton track
imaging detector in which the light output produced by a fast scintillator is
used to perform a complete reconstruction in space and time of the interaction
events. The proposed idea is viable thanks to the dramatic advances in low
noise and single photon counting achieved in the last decade by new scientific
CMOS cameras as well as pixel sensors, like Timepix or MIMOSIS. In this
contribution, we report the advances on the RIPTIDE concept: Geant4 Monte Carlo

construct a basis of principal components (PCs). All light curves from a more
realistic ZTF simulation were written as a linear combination of this basis.
The corresponding coefficients were used as features in training a random
forest classifier. The same method was applied to long (>30 days) and medium
(<30 days) light curves. The latter aimed to simulate the data situation found
within the ZTF alert stream. Classification based on long light curves achieved
73.87% precision and 82.19% recall. Medium baseline analysis resulted in 69.30%
precision and 69.74% recall, thus confirming the robustness of precision
results when limited to 30 days of observations. In both cases, dwarf flares
and point Type Ia supernovae were the most frequent contaminants. The final
trained model was integrated into the Fink broker and has been distributing
fast transients, tagged as \texttt{KN\_candidates}, to the astronomical

features specifically designed to grasp different light curve behaviors provide
enough information to separate fast (KN-like) from slow (non-KN-like) evolving

separation of protons and hydroxide ions across one-atom-thick graphene and
enhanced by strong interfacial electric fields. The found photo-effect is
attributed to the combination of graphene's perfect selectivity with respect to
protons, which prevents proton-hydroxide recombination, and to proton transport
acceleration by the Wien effect, which occurs in synchrony with the water
dissociation reaction. Our findings provide fundamental insights into ion

independence of the components of a high-dimensional vector. Instead of testing
if all pairwise associations (e.g. all pairwise Kendall's $\tau$) between the
components vanish, we are interested in the (null)-hypothesis that all pairwise
associations do not exceed a certain threshold in absolute value. The
consideration of these hypotheses is motivated by the observation that in the
high-dimensional regime, it is rare, and perhaps impossible, to have a null
hypothesis that can be exactly modeled by assuming that all pairwise
associations are precisely equal to zero.
  The formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis makes the
problem of constructing tests non-standard and in this paper we provide a
solution for a broad class of dependence measures, which can be estimated by
$U$-statistics. In particular we develop an asymptotic and a bootstrap level
$\alpha$-test for the new hypotheses in the high-dimensional regime. We also
prove that the new tests are minimax-optimal and demonstrate good finite sample
properties by means of a small simulation study.

materials in a two-scale setting where the material is specified at a fine
microscopic scale of heterogeneities that is much smaller than the coarse

medium where each grain is governed by crystal plasticity while the solid is
subjected to macroscopic dynamic loads. The theory of homogenization allows us
to solve the macroscale problem directly with a constitutive relation that is
defined implicitly by the solution of the microscale problem. However, the
homogenization leads to a highly complex history dependence at the macroscale,
one that can be quite different from that at the microscale. In this paper, we
examine the use of machine-learning, and especially deep neural networks, to
harness data generated by repeatedly solving the finer scale model to: (i) gain
insights into the history dependence and the macroscopic internal variables
that govern the overall response; and (ii) to create a computationally

coarser scale with no further modeling. We do so by introducing a recurrent

accuracy at a cost comparable to a conventional empirical constitutive
relation.

accurate prediction and leads to a higher risk of overfitting. Moreover,
unimodal representations also contain noisy information that negatively
influences the learning of cross-modal dynamics. To this end, we introduce the
multimodal information bottleneck (MIB), aiming to learn a powerful and
sufficient multimodal representation that is free of redundancy and to filter
out noisy information in unimodal representations. Specifically, inheriting
from the general information bottleneck (IB), MIB aims to learn the minimal
sufficient representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information
between the representation and the target and simultaneously constraining the
mutual information between the representation and the input data. Different
from general IB, our MIB regularizes both the multimodal and unimodal
representations, which is a comprehensive and flexible framework that is
compatible with any fusion methods. We develop three MIB variants, namely,
early-fusion MIB, late-fusion MIB, and complete MIB, to focus on different
perspectives of information constraints. Experimental results suggest that the

the size of the lattice, the weak noise is chosen not to compete with the weak

architecture, and exhibit interesting capabilities such as learning with local
error signals and reduced forgetting in sequential learning. In this work, we
introduce a novel gating architecture, named Globally Gated Deep Linear
Networks (GGDLNs) where gating units are shared among all processing units in
each layer, thereby decoupling the architectures of the nonlinear but unlearned
gatings and the learned linear processing motifs. We derive exact equations for
the generalization properties in these networks in the finite-width
thermodynamic limit, defined by $P,N\rightarrow\infty, P/N\sim O(1)$, where P
and N are the training sample size and the network width respectively. We find
that the statistics of the network predictor can be expressed in terms of
kernels that undergo shape renormalization through a data-dependent matrix
compared to the GP kernels. Our theory accurately captures the behavior of
finite width GGDLNs trained with gradient descent dynamics. We show that kernel
shape renormalization gives rise to rich generalization properties w.r.t.
network width, depth and L2 regularization amplitude. Interestingly, networks
with sufficient gating units behave similarly to standard ReLU networks.
Although gatings in the model do not participate in supervised learning, we
show the utility of unsupervised learning of the gating parameters.
Additionally, our theory allows the evaluation of the network's ability for
learning multiple tasks by incorporating task-relevant information into the
gating units. In summary, our work is the first exact theoretical solution of
learning in a family of nonlinear networks with finite width. The rich and
diverse behavior of the GGDLNs suggests that they are helpful analytically
tractable models of learning single and multiple tasks, in finite-width
nonlinear deep networks.

instance, AdaMix can leverage a mixture of adapters like Houlsby or a mixture
of low rank decomposition matrices like LoRA to improve downstream task

error control. Balzer et al. previously proposed *Adaptive Prespecification*
within TMLE to flexibly and automatically select, from a prespecified set, the
approach that maximizes empirical efficiency in small trials (N$<$40). To avoid
overfitting with few randomized units, selection was previously limited to
working generalized linear models, adjusting for a single covariate. Now, we
tailor Adaptive Prespecification to trials with many randomized units. Using
$V$-fold cross-validation and the estimated influence curve-squared as the loss
function, we select from an expanded set of candidates, including modern
machine learning methods adjusting for multiple covariates. As assessed in
simulations exploring a variety of data generating processes, our approach
maintains Type-I error control (under the null) and offers substantial gains in

massive, the spiral wakes generated by the planet dominate the evolution of the
disc and gravitational instabilities are completely suppressed. If the planet's
mass is too small, then gravitational instabilities are unaffected. If the
planet's mass lies between these extremes, gravitational instabilities are
weakened. We present mock Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
continuum observations showing that the observability of large-scale spiral
structures is diminished or completely suppressed when the planet is massive
enough to influence the disc's evolution. Our results show that massive discs
that would be expected to be gravitationally unstable can appear axisymmetric
in the presence of a planet. Thus, the absence of observed large-scale spiral
structures alone is not enough to place upper limits on the disc's mass, which
could have implications on observations of young Class I discs with rings &

performance of numerical methods and reducing the overall computational cost.
In particular, we employ the k-means clustering algorithm and Graph Neural

Moreover, GNNs have high online inference speed and the advantage to process
naturally and simultaneously both the graph structure of mesh and the
geometrical information, such as the areas of the elements or their barycentric
coordinates. These techniques are compared with METIS, a standard algorithm for
graph partitioning, which is meant to process only the graph information of the
mesh. We demonstrate that performance in terms of quality metrics is enhanced
for ML strategies. Such models also show a good degree of generalization when
applied to more complex geometries, such as brain MRI scans, and the capability
of preserving the quality of the grid. The effectiveness of these strategies is
demonstrated also when applied to MultiGrid (MG) solvers in a Polygonal

energy phenomenon and alternative gravity theories. They are receiving special
attention nowadays in view of the new generation of galaxy spectroscopic
surveys, which are covering an unprecedented volume and redshift range. There
are two primary statistics in void studies: (i) the void size function, which
characterises the abundance of voids, and (ii) the void-galaxy
cross-correlation function, which contains information about the density and
velocity fields in these regions. However, it is necessary a complete
description of the effects of geometrical (Alcock-Paczynski effect, AP) and
dynamical (Kaiser effect, RSD) distortions around voids in order to design
reliable cosmological tests based on these statistics. Observational
measurements show prominent anisotropic patterns that lead to biased
cosmological constraints if they are not properly modelled. This thesis
addresses this problematic by presenting a theoretical and statistical
framework based on dynamical and cosmological foundations capable of describing
all the underlying effects involved: the expansion effect (t-RSD), the
off-centring effect (v-RSD), the AP-volume effect and the ellipticity effect
(e-RSD). These effects can be understood by studying the mapping of voids
between real and redshift space. In this way, we lay the foundations for a
proper modelling of the aforementioned statistics. In addition, we present a
new cosmological test based on two perpendicular projections of the correlation
function. The method is fiducial-cosmology free, which allows us to effectively
break any possible degeneracy between the cosmological parameters involved.
Moreover, it allows us to significantly reduce the number of mock catalogues
needed to estimate covariances.

prior information about the time misalignments. For that, we construct a convex
optimization based on the norm minimization problem to directly recover the
global model by solving a convex semi-definite program. The performance of the
proposed method is evaluated in terms of accuracy and convergence via numerical
experiments. We show that our proposed algorithm is close to the ideal
synchronized scenario by $10\%$, and performs $4\times$ better than the simple
case where no recovering method is used.

maximising the received power at the worst possible receiver location by
considering the spherical nature of the electromagnetic (EM) wavefronts in the
Fresnel region while assuming perfect knowledge of the channel at the
transmitter. For the case of two transmit antennas, we derive a closed-form
expression for the optimal positioning of the antennas which is purely
determined by the geometry of the environment. If the room contains locations
where the far-field approximation holds, the proposed positioning is shown to
reduce to the far-field solution. The analytical solution is validated through
simulation. Furthermore, the maximum received power at the locations yielding
the worst performance is quantified and the power gain over the optimal
far-field solution is presented. For the considered cuboid environment, we show
that a distributed antenna system is optimal in the Fresnel region, whereas a
co-located antenna architecture is ideal for the far-field.

driven by line-scattering of the star's radiative momentum, while in the Sun
and even lower-mass stars a much weaker mass loss arises from the thermal
expansion of a mechanically heated corona. In exoplanets around such low-mass
stars, the radiative heating and wind interaction can lead to thermal expansion
or mechanical ablation of their atmospheres. Stellar magnetospheres result from
the internal trapping of the wind outflow, while planetary magnetospheres are
typically shaped by the external impact from the star's wind. But in both cases
the stressing can drive magnetic reconnection that results in observable

important part, impacting the patients emotional balance, psychology, and
behaviour. Standard self-reporting tools, such as the Visual Analogue Scale for
pain, fail to capture this burden. Moreover, this type of tools is susceptible
to a degree of subjectivity, dependent on the patients clear understanding of
how to use it, social biases, and their ability to translate a complex
experience to a scale. To overcome these and other self-reporting challenges,
pain intensity estimation has been previously studied based on facial
expressions, electroencephalograms, brain imaging, and autonomic features.
However, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been attempted to base this
estimation on the patient narratives of the personal experience of chronic
pain, which is what we propose in this work. Indeed, in the clinical assessment
and management of chronic pain, verbal communication is essential to convey
information to physicians that would otherwise not be easily accessible through
standard reporting tools, since language, sociocultural, and psychosocial
variables are intertwined. We show that language features from patient
narratives indeed convey information relevant for pain intensity estimation,
and that our computational models can take advantage of that. Specifically, our
results show that patients with mild pain focus more on the use of verbs,
whilst moderate and severe pain patients focus on adverbs, and nouns and
adjectives, respectively, and that these differences allow for the distinction
between these three pain classes.

problems with data distributed across clients. In FL, to reduce the
communication overhead of data between clients and the server, each client
communicates the local FL parameters instead of the local data. However, when a
wireless network connects clients and the server, the communication resource
limitations of the clients may prevent completing the training of the FL
iterations. Therefore, communication-efficient variants of FL have been widely
investigated. Lazily Aggregated Quantized Gradient (LAQ) is one of the
promising communication-efficient approaches to lower resource usage in FL.
However, LAQ assigns a fixed number of bits for all iterations, which may be
communication-inefficient when the number of iterations is medium to high or
convergence is approaching. This paper proposes Adaptive Lazily Aggregated
Quantized Gradient (A-LAQ), which is a method that significantly extends LAQ by
assigning an adaptive number of communication bits during the FL iterations. We
train FL in an energy-constraint condition and investigate the convergence

the fly in a parameter-agnostic manner, and empirically achieve faster
convergence for solving minimization problems. When it comes to nonconvex
minimax optimization, however, current convergence analyses of gradient descent
ascent (GDA) combined with adaptive stepsizes require careful tuning of
hyper-parameters and the knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. Such a
discrepancy arises from the primal-dual nature of minimax problems and the
necessity of delicate time-scale separation between the primal and dual updates
in attaining convergence. In this work, we propose a single-loop adaptive GDA
algorithm called TiAda for nonconvex minimax optimization that automatically
adapts to the time-scale separation. Our algorithm is fully parameter-agnostic

partitioning approach to enable our proposed divide-and-conquer strategy for
the graph anonymization, and propose effective optimization techniques such as

large-scale graphs. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the

$\text{O}_2$+$\text{O}_2$ system leveraging high-fidelity potential energy
surfaces and quasi-classical trajectory calculations. The model is used to
investigate internal energy transfer and non-equilibrium reactive processes in
dissociating environment using a master equation approach, whereby the kinetics
of each internal rovibrational state is explicitly computed. To cope with the
exponentially large number of elementary processes that characterize reactive
bimolecular collisions, the internal states of the collision partner are
assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at a prescribed internal
temperature. This procedure makes the problem tractable, reducing the
computational cost to a comparable scale with the $\text{O}_2$+O system. The
constructed rovibrational-specific kinetic database covers the temperature
range of 7500-20000 K. The analysis of the energy transfer and dissociation
process in isochoric and isothermal conditions reveals that significant
departures from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution occur during the energy
transfer and dissociation phase. Comparing the population distribution of the
$\text{O}_2$ molecules against the $\text{O}_2$+O demonstrates a more
significant extent of non-equilibrium characterized by a more diffuse
distribution whereby the vibrational strands are more clearly identifiable.
This is partly due to a less efficient mixing of the rovibrational states,
which results in more diffuse rovibrational distributions in the
quasi-steady-state distribution. The master equation analysis for the combined
$\text{O}_3$+$\text{O}_4$ system reveals that the $\text{O}_2$+$\text{O}_2$
governs the early stage of energy transfer, while the $\text{O}_2$+O takes
control of the dissociation dynamics. The findings will provide strong physical

are repulsive to the mobile agent. To the original APF algorithm (by Khatib),
we propose two major updates which significantly improve the performance of DAA
using APF. First, we propose to improve an existing classical method that
replaces the gradient descent optimization of the potential field cost function
on a continuous domain with a combinatorial optimization on a set of predefined
points (called bacteria points) around the agent's current location. Our
proposition includes an adaptive hyperparameter that changes the value of the
potential function associated to each bacteria point based on the current
environmental measurements. Our proposed solution improves the navigation
performance in terms of convergence to the target at the expense of minimal
increase in computational complexity. Second, we propose an improved potential
field cost function of the bacteria points by introducing a new branching cost
function which further improves the navigation performance. The algorithms were
tested on a set of Monte Carlo simulation trials where the environment changes
for each trial. Our simulation results show 25% lower navigation time and

is easy to show that for any connected graph $G$ of order divisible by $r$,
$G^{2r-2}$ contains a $K_r$-factor. This is best possible as there exist
connected graphs $G$ of order divisible by $r$ such that $G^{2r-3}$ does not

$k$ parts of size $4$, such that the four vertices in any part are contained in
a subtree of $G$ of order at most 5. More generally, we conjecture that for any

transmission, storage and processing power. Processing requirements to handle
this plethora of data is quickly outpacing the utility of conventional
processing techniques. Transitioning to quantum processing and algorithms that
offer promising efficiencies over conventional methods can address some of
these issues. However, to make this transformation possible, fundamental issues
of implementing real time Quantum algorithms must be overcome for crucial
processes needed for intelligent analysis applications. For example, consider
edge detection tasks which require time-consuming acquisition processes and are
further hindered by the complexity of the devices used thus limiting
feasibility for implementation in real-time applications. Convolution is
another example of an operation that is essential for signal and image
processing applications, where the mathematical operations consist of an
intelligent mixture of multiplication and addition that require considerable
computational resources. This paper studies a new paired transform-based
quantum representation and computation of one-dimensional and 2-D signals
convolutions and gradients. A new visual data representation is defined to
simplify convolution calculations making it feasible to parallelize convolution
and gradient operations for more efficient performance. The new data
representation is demonstrated on multiple illustrative examples for quantum
edge detection, gradients, and convolution. Furthermore, the efficiency of the
proposed approach is shown on real-world images.

enough -- each robot needs a controller. One could create controllers for some

time consuming. This work presents a method that uses demonstrations from one
set of designs to accelerate policy learning for additional designs. We
leverage a learning framework in which a graph neural network is made up of
modular components, each component corresponds to a type of module (e.g., a
leg, wheel, or body) and these components can be recombined to learn from
multiple designs at once. In this paper we develop a combined reinforcement and
imitation learning algorithm. Our method is novel because the policy is
optimized to both maximize a reward for one design, and simultaneously imitate
demonstrations from different designs, within one objective function. We show
that when the modular policy is optimized with this combined objective,
demonstrations from one set of designs influence how the policy behaves on a
different design, decreasing the number of training iterations needed.

to the photon therapy, since it deposits most of the energy at the end of
range, namely the Bragg peak (BP). Protoacoustic technique was developed to in
vivo determine the BP locations. However, it requires large dose delivery to
the tissue to obtain an averaged acoustic signal with a sufficient signal to
noise ratio (SNR), which is not suitable in clinics. We propose a deep
learning-based technique to acquire denoised acoustic signals and reduce BP
range uncertainty with much lower doses. Approach: Three accelerometers were
placed on the distal surface of a cylindrical polyethylene (PE) phantom to
collect protoacoustic signals. In total 512 raw signals were collected at each
device. Device-specific stack autoencoder (SAE) denoising models were trained
to denoise the input signals, which were generated by averaging 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
or 32 raw signals. Both supervised and unsupervised learning training
strategies were tested for comparison. Mean squared error (MSE),
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Bragg peak (BP) range uncertainty were used
for model evaluation. Main results: After SAE denoising, the MSE was
substantially reduced, and the SNR was enhanced. Overall, the supervised SAEs
outperformed the unsupervised SAEs in BP range verification. For the high
accuracy detector, it achieved a BP range uncertainty of 0.20 +/- 3.44 mm by
averaging over 8 raw signals, while for the other two low accuracy detectors,
they achieved the BP uncertainty of 1.44 +/- 6.45 mm and -0.23 +/- 4.88 mm by
averaging 16 raw signals, respectively. Significance: We have proposed a deep
learning based denoising method to enhance the SNR of protoacoustic
measurements and improve the accuracy in BP range verification, which greatly
reduces the dose and time for potential clinical applications.

case of short GRBs. Our findings can lead to the identification of bursts
exploding in AGN disk environments through their unique spectral evolution
coupled with a central location. In addition, the study of the time-dependent
evolution would allow for studying the disk structure, once the identification
with an AGN has been established. Finally, our findings lead to insight into
whether GRBs contribute to the AGN emission, and which kind, thus helping to
answer the question of whether GRBs can be the cause of some of the as-of-yet
unexplained AGN time variability.

fail-stop failures, where processes are either working or permanently stopped,
and their state (working/stopped) is known. In fact, systems are often affected
by grey failures: failures that are latent, possibly transient, and may affect
the system in subtle ways that later lead to major issues (such as crashes,
limited availability, overload). We introduce a model of actor-based systems
with grey failures, based on two interlinked layers: an actor model, given as
an asynchronous process calculus with discrete time, and a failure model that
represents failure patterns to inject in the system. Our failure model captures
not only fail-stop node and link failures, but also grey failures (e.g.,
partial, transient). We give a behavioural equivalence relation based on weak
barbed bisimulation to compare systems on the basis of their ability to recover
from failures, and on this basis we define some desirable properties of
reliable systems. By doing so, we reduce the problem of checking reliability
properties of systems to the problem of checking bisimulation.

cylindrical explosion, as well as on dynamical spacetimes, i.e. the
oscillations of a 3D TOV star. We find excellent agreement with analytic

Next we apply Connes--Kreimer renormalization theory to the perturbative
Feynman graph expansion: In this framework, subdivergences are organized via
the coproduct of a Hopf algebra and the renormalization operation is described
as an algebraic Birkhoff decomposition. To this end, we generalize and improve
known coproduct identities and a theorem of van Suijlekom (2007) that relates
(generalized) gauge symmetries to Hopf ideals. In particular, our
generalization applies to gravity, as was suggested by Kreimer (2008). In
addition, our results are applicable to theories with multiple vertex residues,
coupling constants and such with a transversal structure. Additionally, we also
provide criteria for the compatibility of these Hopf ideals with Feynman rules
and the chosen renormalization scheme. We proceed by calculating the
corresponding gravity-matter Feynman rules for any valence and with a general
gauge parameter. Then we display all propagator and three-valent vertex Feynman
rules and calculate the respective cancellation identities. Finally, we propose
planned follow-up projects: This includes a generalization of Wigner's
classification of elementary particles to linearized gravity, the
representation of cancellation identities via Feynman graph cohomology and an
investigation on the equivalence of different definitions for the graviton
field. In particular, we argue that the appropriate setup to study perturbative
BRST cohomology is a differential-graded Hopf algebra.

finite-horizon testing which enables the decision rule to allocate samples

  Interference","35 pages",,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One core assumption that is consistently adopted for valid causal inference
is that of no interference between experimental units, i.e., the outcome of an
experimental unit is not a function of the treatments assigned to other
experimental units. This assumption can be violated in real-life experiments,
which significantly complicates the task of causal inference as one must
disentangle direct treatment effects from ``spillover'' effects. Current
methodologies are lacking, as they cannot handle arbitrary, unknown
interference structures to permit inference on causal estimands. We present a
general framework to address the limitations of existing approaches. Our
framework is based on the new concept of the ``degree of interference'' (DoI).
The DoI is a unit-level latent variable that captures the spillover effects on
a unit. This concept can flexibly accommodate any interference structure. We
also develop a Bayesian nonparametric methodology to perform inferences on the
estimands under our framework. We illustrate the DoI concept and properties of
our Bayesian methodology via extensive simulation studies and a real-life case
study from additive manufacturing for which interference is a critical concern
in achieving geometric accuracy control. Ultimately, our framework enables us
to infer causal effects without strong structural assumptions on interference.

application is neuroimaging, where edge weights could be functional
connectivity measured between an atlas of brain regions, node covariates could
be task activations at each brain region, and disease status or score on a
behavioral task could be the response of interest. The goal is to use the edge
weights and node covariates to predict the response and to identify a
parsimonious and interpretable set of predictive features. We propose an
approach that makes use of feature groups defined according to a community
structure believed to exist in the network (naturally occurring in neuroimaging
applications). We propose two schemes for forming feature groups where each
group incorporates both edge weights and node covariates, and derive algorithms
for both schemes optimization using an overlapping group LASSO penalty.
Empirical results on synthetic data show that in certain settings our method,
relative to competing approaches, has similar or improved prediction error
along with superior support recovery, enabling a more interpretable and
potentially a more accurate understanding of the underlying process. We also
apply the method to neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. Our
approach is widely applicable in human neuroimaging where interpretability and
parsimony are highly desired, and can be applied in any other domain where edge

Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration may provide a powerful way to constrain
deviations of the metric functions from what is expected from general
relativity (GR) solutions. We focus our attention on
Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory with three well motivated couplings,
including the dilatonic and $Z_2$ symmetric cases. We then analyze the shadow
radius of black holes in the contest of the spontaneous scalarization scenario
within EsGB theory with an additional coupling to the Ricci scalar (EsRGB).
Finally, we turn our attention to spontaneous scalarization in the
Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theory and demonstrate the impact of the
parameters on the black hole shadow. Our results show that black hole imaging
is an important tool for constraining black holes with scalar hair and for some
part of the parameter space, black holes solutions with scalar hair may be
marginally favoured compared to solutions of GR.

capable of ionizing H and He from the observed H$\beta$ and HeI$\,\lambda$4471

rate and spectral hardness predicted by a TLUSTY model fit to the stellar SED
agrees with our observational measurements within the uncertainties. We then
fit Cloudy photoionization models to the full suite of optical emission lines

simultaneously matches lines across a wide range of ionization energies.
Finally, we detect OIII] and NIII] nebular emission in the Hubble Space

establishing the convergence of splitting methods for a large class of
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), including additive, diagonal and
scalar noise types. The central idea is to view the splitting method as a
replacement of the driving signal of an SDE, namely Brownian motion and time,
with a piecewise linear path that yields a sequence of ODEs $-$ which can be
discretised to produce a numerical scheme. This new way of understanding
splitting methods is inspired by, but does not use, rough path theory. We show
that when the driving piecewise linear path matches certain iterated stochastic
integrals of Brownian motion, then a high order splitting method can be
obtained. We propose a general proof methodology for establishing the strong
convergence of these approximations that is akin to the general framework of
Milstein and Tretyakov. That is, once local error estimates are obtained for
the splitting method, then a global rate of convergence follows. This approach
can then be readily applied in future research on SDE splitting methods. By
incorporating recently developed approximations for iterated integrals of
Brownian motion into these piecewise linear paths, we propose several high
order splitting methods for SDEs satisfying a certain commutativity condition.
In our experiments, which include the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model and additive
noise SDEs (noisy anharmonic oscillator, stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model,
underdamped Langevin dynamics), the new splitting methods exhibit convergence
rates of $O(h^{3/2})$ and outperform schemes previously proposed in the
literature.

Specifically, we design and implement an efficient defense based on Bloom

demonstrate that this ""perfect"" filter does not prevent the leakage of training

with a demonstration of quantum teleportation using the AKLT state prepared by

of coherent DM axions to oscillating magnetic fields in the presence of static,
laboratory magnetic fields. Crucially, such experiments $\unicode{x2013}$
including ABRACADABRA $\unicode{x2013}$ have to-date worked in the limit that
the axion Compton wavelength is larger than the size of the experiment, which
allows one to take a magnetoquasistatic (MQS) approach to modeling the axion
signal. We use finite element methods to solve the coupled
axion-electromagnetism equations of motion without assuming the MQS
approximation. We show that the MQS approximation becomes a poor approximation
at frequencies two orders of magnitude lower than the naive MQS limit.
Radiation losses diminish the quality factor of an otherwise high-$Q$ resonant
readout circuit, though this may be mitigated through shielding and minimizing
lossy materials. Additionally, self-resonances associated with the detector
geometry change the reactive properties of the pickup system, leading to two
generic features beyond MQS: there are frequencies that require an inductive
rather than capacitive tuning to maintain resonance, and the detector itself
becomes a multi-pole resonator at high frequencies. Accounting for these
features, competitive sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling may be extended
well beyond the naive MQS limit.

larger for smaller masses, for smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in
the more massive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their

lack detectable gas reservoirs at $z=0$, unless they are massive like the
Magellanic Clouds and M32. Nevertheless, their stellar assembly exhibits a
large degree of diversity. On average, the cumulative star formation histories
are more extended for brighter, more massive satellites with a later infall,
and for those in less massive hosts. Based on these relationships, we can even
infer infall periods for observedMWand M31 dwarfs: e.g. 0-4 Gyr ago for the
Magellanic Clouds and Leo I, 4-8 and 0-2 Gyr ago for M32 and IC 10,

deprives TNG50 satellites of their gas reservoirs and ultimately quenches their
star formation, even though only a few per cent of the present-day satellites
around the 198 TNG50 MW/M31-like hosts appear as jellyfish. The typical time
since quenching for currently quenched TNG50 satellites is
$6.9^{+2.5}_{-3.3}~{\rm Gyr}$ ago. The TNG50 results are consistent with the
quenched fractions and stellar assembly of observed MW and M31 satellites,

dispersion driven by star-forming regions, while the $11$ cm B-field is
cospatial with high HI velocity dispersion driven by galaxy interaction. This
result shows the dissociation between the warm gas mainly disturbed by the

atom arrays and utilizes recently demonstrated coherent qubit transport
combined with controlled-phase gate operations. We describe methods for probing

computational costs. In both approaches, the EOSs have identical priors and
have been built using the sound-speed parameterization method so as to satisfy
the constraints from X-ray and gravitational-waves observations, as well as
those from Chiral Effective Theory and perturbative QCD. In all cases, the two
approaches lead to very similar results and the $90\%$-confidence levels are
essentially overlapping. Some differences do appear, but in regions where the
probability density is extremely small and are mostly due to the sharp cutoff
set on the binary tidal deformability $\tilde \Lambda \leq 720$ employed in the
constant-likelihood analysis. Our analysis has also produced two additional
results. First, a clear inverse correlation between the normalized central
number density of a maximally massive star, $n_{\rm c, TOV}/n_s$, and the
radius of a maximally massive star, $R_{\rm TOV}$. Second, and most
importantly, it has confirmed the relation between the chirp mass
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm chirp}$ and the binary tidal deformability $\tilde{\Lambda}$.
The importance of this result is that it relates a quantity that is measured
very accurately, $\mathcal{M}_{\rm chirp}$, with a quantity that contains
important information on the micro-physics, $\tilde{\Lambda}$. Hence, once
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm chirp}$ is measured in future detections, our relation has
the potential of setting tight constraints on $\tilde{\Lambda}$.

properties and abundance of CGM gas across the sample are diverse, and the
fractional budgets of different phases (cold, warm, and hot), as well as
neutral HI mass and metal mass, vary considerably. Over our stellar mass range
of $10^{10.5} < M_\star / \rm{M}_\odot < 10^{10.9}$, radial profiles of gas
physical properties from $0.15 < R\rm{ / R_{\rm 200c}} < 1.0$ reveal great CGM
structural complexity, with significant variations both at fixed distance
around individual galaxies, and across different galaxies. CGM gas is
multi-phase: the distributions of density, temperature and entropy are all
multimodal, while metallicity and thermal pressure distributions are unimodal;
all are broad. We present predictions for magnetic fields in MW-like halos: a
median field strength of $|B|\sim\,1\mu$G in the inner halo decreases rapidly
at larger distance, while magnetic pressure dominates over thermal pressure
only within $\sim0.2 \times \rm{R_{200c}}$. Virial temperature gas at $\sim
10^6\,$K coexists with a sub-dominant cool, $< 10^5\,$K component in
approximate pressure equilibrium. Finally, the physical properties of the CGM
are tightly connected to the galactic star formation rate, in turn dependent on
feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In TNG50, we find that energy
from SMBH-driven kinetic winds generates high-velocity outflows ($\gtrsim
500-2000$ km/s), heats gas to super-virial temperatures ($> 10^{6.5-7}$ K), and
regulates the net balance of inflows versus outflows in otherwise quasi-static
gaseous halos.

theoretical prediction for the latter property in the context of nuclear beta
decay, despite the importance of this process for the past, present, and future
of neutrino experimentation. In this paper, we provide a quantitative
prediction for the size of a beta-decay-induced electron antineutrino
wavepacket by treating the parent nucleus decaying to an entangled
antineutrino-recoil system using the formalism of open quantum systems. Of
central importance is the delocalization scale of the parent particle. We
construct a systematic description of the hierarchy of localizing entanglements
that provides an unambiguous statement of the relevant localization scale,
found to be closely related to the diameter of the parent nucleus (e.g.
$\sim$5-6~fm for beta-decaying fission daughters) and as low as the typical
nucleon-nucleon correlation distance ($\sim$1~fm). Inside a nuclear reactor,
for example, this translates to initial electron antineutrino wavepacket widths
in the $\sigma_{\nu,x}\sim10\mathrm{-}400$~pm range for
$E_{\overline{\nu}_e}>1.8$~MeV, with dependencies on decaying nucleus size, the
emitted antineutrino energy, and the kinematics of the recoiling system.
Wavepacket sizes in this envelope do not produce an observable effect on
oscillation probability in foreseeable reactor experiments in the standard
three-neutrino model, including JUNO which is expected to be sensitive to
$\sigma_{\nu,x}\lesssim3$~pm.

time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary,
and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics can impact
stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration,
and the evolution of (super)massive black-hole binaries. We discuss the
dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with
recent observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary
accretion involves binaries embedded in ""big"" disks, which may contribute to
the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include:
  $\bullet$ Circumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at
$P_{\rm b}$ (the binary period) or $\sim 5P_{\rm p}$, depending on the binary
eccentricity $e_{\rm b}$ and mass ratio $q_{\rm b}$.
  $\bullet$ The inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent
eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical
processes (e.g. planet migration) taking place in the disk.
  $\bullet$ Over long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward
equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay, as is
commonly assumed. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary
parameters ($e_{\rm b}$ and $q_{\rm b}$), and on the thermodynamic properties
of the accreting gas.
  $\bullet$ A misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve
toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when $e_{\rm b}$ is
significant, the disk can evolve toward ""polar alignment"", with the disk plane
perpendicular to the binary plane.

flexible, data-driven semi-empirical model is developed based on a minimal set
of parameters and under the zero order assumption that the incidence of AGN in
galaxies is independent of environment. This is used to predict how the
fraction of X-ray selected AGN among galaxies in massive dark matter halos
($\gtrsim 3\times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$) evolves with redshift and reveal
tensions with observations. At high redshift, $z\sim1.2$, the model
underpredicts AGN fractions, particularly at high X-ray luminosities, $L_X(\rm
2-10\,keV) \gtrsim 10^{44}\, erg \, s^{-1}$. At low redshift, $z\sim0.2$, the
model estimates fractions of moderate luminosity AGN ($L_X(\rm 2-10\,keV)
\gtrsim 10^{43}\, erg \, s^{-1}$) that are a factor of $2-3$ higher than the
observations. These findings reject the zero order assumption on which the
semi-empirical model hinges and point to a strong and redshift-dependent
influence of the small-scale environment on the growth of black holes. Cluster
of galaxies appear to promote AGN activity relative to the model expectation at
$z\sim1.2$ and suppress it close to the present day. These trends could be
explained by the increasing gas content of galaxies toward higher redshift
combined with an efficient triggering of AGN at earlier times in galaxies that
fall onto clusters.

Kondo physics to quantum information science by exploiting overscreened Kondo
impurities with residual anyon-like impurity entropy. While this physics was
proposed in the fine-tuned multi-channel Kondo setup or in the Majorana-based
topological Kondo effect, we here study the Kondo effect with symplectic
symmetry Sp(2k) and present details about the implementation which importantly
only involves conventional s-wave superconductivity coupled to an array of

Zeeman drives the system to a 2-channel SU(k) fixed point. Exact results for
the residual entropy, specific heat, and magnetization are derived using the
thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for Sp(2k). This solution not only proves the
existence of a quantum critical ground state with anyon-like Hilbert space
dimension but also a particularly weak non-Fermi liquid behavior at
criticality. We interpret the weakness of non-analyticities as a manifestation
of suppressed density of states at the impurity causing only a very weak
connection of putative anyons and conduction electrons. Given this weak
connection, the simplicity of the design, and the stability of the effect, we
conjecture that the symplectic Kondo effect may be particularly suitable for
quantum information applications.

can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\ge$ 1:4). For this, we
use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198
analog galaxies, selected based on their $z=0$ stellar mass ($10^{10.5-11.2}
{\rm M_{\odot}}$), disky stellar morphology and local environment. Firstly,
major mergers are common: 85 per cent (168) of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50
have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 31
galaxies (16 per cent) have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5
Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starbursts
at pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation after
coalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disk is
destroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover,
higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar disks. In
comparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxies
with recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar disks,
more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex-situ mass
fractions, but similarly massive kinematically-defined bulges. All this is
qualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxy
and Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8-11
and ~2 Gyr ago, respectively. According to contemporary cosmological
simulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaining
a relatively-thin stellar disk at $z=0$.

binary inspirals whose components have large spin-induced quadrupole moments.
The spin-induced quadrupole of a body first appears in the phase of a waveform
at the early inspiral stage of the binary coalescence, making it a relatively
clean probe of the internal structure of the body. However, for objects with
large quadrupolar deviations from Kerr, searches using binary black hole (BBH)
models would be ineffective. In order to perform a computationally-feasible
search, we present two dimensionally-reduced models which are derived from the
original six-dimensional post-Newtonian waveform for such systems. Our
dimensional reduction method is guided by power counting in the post-Newtonian
expansion, suitable reparameterizations of the source physics, and truncating
terms in the phase that are small in most physically well-motivated regions of
parameter space. In addition, we note that large quadrupolar deviations cause
the frequency at which a binary system reaches its minimum binding energy to be
reduced substantially. This minimum signals the end of the inspiral regime and
provides a natural cutoff for the PN waveform. We provide accurate analytic
estimates for these frequency cutoffs. Finally, we perform injection studies to
test the effectualness of the dimensionally reduced waveforms. We find that
over $80\%$ of the injections have an effectualness of $\varepsilon > 0.999$,
significantly higher than is typically required for standard BBH banks, for
systems with component spins of $|\chi_i| \lesssim 0.6$ and dimensionless
quadrupole of $\kappa_i \lesssim 10^3$. Importantly, these waveforms represent
an essential first step towards enabling an effective search for astrophysical

generate the lepton asymmetries in the heavy Majorana neutrino decays stem from
complex Dirac-type Yukawa couplings. In this paper we explore the case in which
that CP violation originates from the vacuum expectation value of a complex
scalar singlet at a very high scale. This non-trivial CP-violating phase can be
successfully communicated to the low-energy neutrino sector via the heavy
neutrino portal. The new scalar-singlet degrees of freedom generate new
contributions to the CP asymmetries relevant for leptogenesis not only at the
one-loop level but also through tree-level three-body decays. These are
computed here for an arbitrary number of heavy neutrinos, Higgs doublets and
scalar singlets. We also take into account the new decays and scattering
processes that enter the unflavoured Boltzmann equations governing the
heavy-neutrino particle densities and the $(B-L)$-asymmetry evolution. Having
established the framework of interest, we present a simple model with two RH
neutrinos, two Higgs doublets and a complex scalar singlet, supplemented with a
$\mathcal{Z}_8$ flavour symmetry. This symmetry minimises the number of free
parameters without compromising the possibility of spontaneous CP violation and
compatibility with neutrino data. In fact, the only viable $\mathcal{Z}_8$
charge assignment shows a preference for a non-trivial spontaneous CP-violating
phase, which in turn leads to a non-vanishing CP asymmetry due to the direct
link between high- and low-energy CP violation. An interesting feature of this
simple setup is that the usual wave and vertex type-I seesaw contributions to
the CP asymmetry vanish due to the $\mathcal{Z}_8$ symmetry. Thus, the observed
baryon-to-photon ratio can be explained thanks to the new couplings among the
heavy neutrinos and the new scalar degrees of freedom.

loss-cone scattering of individual stars, disk migration, and

Binaries that form in gas-poor galactic environments do not experience disk
migration and likely enter the gravitational-wave dominated phase with roughly
isotropic spin orientations. Comparatively, binaries that evolve in gas-rich
galactic environments might experience prominent phases of disk accretion,
where the Bardeen-Petterson effect acts to align the spins of the black holes
with the orbital angular momentum of the disk. However, if the accretion disk
breaks alignment is expected to be strongly suppressed -- a phenomenon that was
recently shown to occur in a large portion of the parameter space. In this
paper, we develop a semi-analytic model of joint gas-driven migration and spin
alignment of supermassive black-hole binaries taking into account the impact of
disk breaking for the first time. Our model predicts the occurrence of distinct
subpopulations of binaries depending on the efficiency of spin alignment. This

black hole mass is estimated as $\sim10^5$ or $\sim10^7 M_\odot$. The VLBA 1.5
GHz image shows an inverse symmetric structure with two discrete radio blobs
separated by an angular distance of $\sim120$ mas, corresponding to $\sim7$
parsec. Furthermore, its integrated radio spectrum has a turnover at the
frequency of $\sim0.44$ GHz. Based on the compactness and spectrum, the nuclear
radio source in NGC 4293 belongs to a sample of (megahertz) peaked spectrum
(PS/MPS) radio sources with compact symmetric morphologies. NGC 4293 has 1.4
GHz radio power of only $\sim10^{20}\,\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$ with the VLBA
observation, which is consistent with local AGNs but lower than the current PS
samples. One of the two blobs has a steep radio spectrum $\alpha=-0.62\pm0.08$
($S_\nu\propto\nu^{+\alpha}$), while the other one has an inverted spectrum
$\alpha=0.32\pm0.10$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz luminosity ratio of the two blobs is
3.23 and both blobs show lateral-flowing structures where the hotspots reside
at the edge of each radio lobe. This can be explained as jet interactions with
dense circumnuclear medium. We estimate the black hole mass of NGC 4293 through
the fundamental plane of black hole activity, which constrains the black hole
mass to be $\lesssim10^6 M_\odot$. It supports that the object is a low-mass
AGN and a potential candidate for accreting and ejecting IMBHs.

the accretion - jet activity. We present radio observations of four AGN-hosting
dwarf galaxies (which potentially harbor IMBHs). Very large array (VLA)
observations indicate steep spectra (indices of $-$0.63 to $-$1.05) between 1.4

steepening for GH047 and GH158 (implying older/relic emission) and flattening
for GH106 and GH163 (implying recent activity). Overlapping emission regions in
the VLA 1.4 GHz and our very long baseline array (VLBA) 1.5 GHz observations,
and possibly symmetric pc-scale extensions are consistent with recent activity
in the latter two. Using the compact VLBA radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity
(probing the accretion activity) and the black hole masses, all AGNs are found
to lie on the empirical fundamental plane relation. The four AGN are radio
quiet with relatively higher Eddington ratios ($0.04 - 0.32$) and resemble the
X-ray binaries during spectral state transitions that entail an outflow
ejection. Furthermore, the radio to X-ray luminosity ratio $\log{R_\mathrm{X}}$
of $-3.9$ to $-5.6$ in these four sources support the scenarios including
corona mass ejection from accretion disk and wind activity. The growth to
kpc-scales likely proceeds along a trajectory similar to young AGNs and peaked
spectrum sources. The above complex clues can thus aid in the detection and
monitoring of IMBHs in the nearby Universe.

close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought
general relativistic effect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole
and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show
that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which
stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole. Following the stellar
orbit, the debris in eTDEs is initially distributed in a crescent that quickly
turns into tight spirals, from which some mass later falls back toward the
black hole, while the remainder is ejected. Internal shocks within the
infalling debris power the observed emission. The resulting light-curve rises
rapidly to roughly the Eddington luminosity, maintains this level for between a
few weeks and a year (depending on both the stellar mass and the black hole
mass), and then drops. Most of its power is in thermal X-rays at a temperature
$\sim (1-2)\times 10^{6}$ K ($\sim 100-200$ eV). The debris evolution and
observational features of eTDEs are qualitatively different from ordinary TDEs,
making eTDEs a new type of TDE. Although eTDEs are relatively rare for
lower-mass black holes, most tidal disruptions around higher-mass black holes

work conducts an in-depth study of exponential integration using Faber

bulge, cold disk, warm disk, and stellar halo, in addition to satellites (with
stellar mass $\ge 5\times10^6\,M_\odot$). According to TNG50 and across all

the highest frequency of EMPs (largest $M_{\mathrm{EMP,

chances of finding them. Such frequency is larger in lower-mass than high-mass
satellites. Moreover, TNG50 predicts that the stellar halo of the main galaxy
always hosts and thus contributes the majority of the EMPs of the system.
Namely, it has the highest mass ratio of EMPs in it to all the EMPs in the

  (WSA&SCC2023)",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  More and more applications that require high reliability and fault tolerance
are realized with wireless network architectures and thus ultimately rely on
the wireless channels, which can be subject to impairments and blockages.
Hence, these architectures require a backup plan in the physical layer in order
to guarantee functionality, especially when safety-relevant aspects are
involved. To this end, this work proposes to utilize the reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) as a resilience mechanism to counteract outages. The
advantages of RISs for such a purpose derive from their inherent addition of
alternative channel links in combination with their reconfigurability. The
major benefits are investigated in a cell-free multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) setting, in which the direct channel paths are subject
to blockages. An optimization problem is formulated that includes rate
allocation with beamforming and phase shift configuration and is solved with a
resilience-aware alternating optimization approach. Numerical results show that
deploying even a randomly-configured RIS to a network reduces the performance
degradation caused by blockages. This becomes even more pronounced in the
optimized case, in which the RIS is able to potentially counteract the
performance degradation entirely. Interestingly, adding more reflecting
elements to the system brings an overall benefit for the resilience, even for
time-sensitive systems, due to the contribution of the RIS reflections, even
when unoptimized.

rearranging and mixing image pairs using visual saliency as guidance. By
explicitly leveraging saliency, SAGE promotes discriminative foreground objects

recent years. Many end-to-end systems have been proposed and show advantages
over conventional cascade systems, which are often composed of recognition,
translation and synthesis sub-systems. However, most of the end-to-end systems
still rely on intermediate textual supervision during training, which makes it
infeasible to work for languages without written forms. In this work, we
propose a novel model, Textless Translatotron, which is based on Translatotron
2, for training an end-to-end direct S2ST model without any textual
supervision. Instead of jointly training with an auxiliary task predicting
target phonemes as in Translatotron 2, the proposed model uses an auxiliary
task predicting discrete speech representations which are obtained from learned
or random speech quantizers. When a speech encoder pre-trained with
unsupervised speech data is used for both models, the proposed model obtains
translation quality nearly on-par with Translatotron 2 on the multilingual
CVSS-C corpus as well as the bilingual Fisher Spanish-English corpus. On the
latter, it outperforms the prior state-of-the-art textless model by +18.5 BLEU.

Cucker-Smale, Motsch-Tadmor, multi-species, and several others, include an
alignment force that is based upon density-dependent averaging protocol. Those
protocols can be viewed as special cases of `environmental averaging'. In this
paper we formalize this concept and introduce a unified framework to study
alignment models systematically.
  Examining general properties of the averagings we find new alignment criteria
that are otherwise obscured by specificity of the model if viewed individually.
In particular, it is shown that the kinetic Cucker-Smale model based on a
Bochner-positive communication kernel $\phi = \psi \ast \psi$ aligns provided
the density of the flock obeys a lower bound $\rho \gtrsim \frac{1}{t^{1/4}}$,
and no bound from above is required.
  Based upon the introduced framework a series of analytical studies are
presented. Those include the mean-field limit in deterministic and stochastic
settings, hydrodynamic limits in the monokinetic and Maxwellian regimes, global
hypocoercivity and relaxation for dissipative kinetic models, several general
alignment results based on chain connectivity of the system. Each study is
constructed by a similar scheme -- first, we identify a set of natural
regularity conditions on the averaging protocol that imply the most general
result, and second, we provide a scrutiny of more deliberate computations going
to specific models. Numerous applications are revealed. This includes
applications to well-posedness and long time behavior of kinetic
Vlasov-alignment and Fokker-Planck-alignment models. In particular, we prove
that solutions to the Fokker-Planck model based on a smooth environmental
averaging gain Gaussian tails uniformly in time and consequently, relax
unconditionally to the global Maxwellian...

and revealed by infrared excesses. The disk around G29-38 was the first to be
discovered and is now well-observed, yet we lack a cohesive picture of its
geometry and dust properties. Here we model the G29-38 disk for the first time
using radiative transfer calculations that account for radial and vertical
temperature and optical depth gradients. We arrive at a set of models that can
match the available infrared measurements well, although they overpredict the
width of the 10 $\mu m$ silicate feature. The resulting set of models has a
disk inner edge located at 92-100 $R_\text{WD}$ (where $R_\text{WD}$ is the
white dwarf radius). This is farther from the star than inferred by previous
modeling efforts due to the presence of a directly illuminated front edge to
the disk. The radial width of the disk is narrow ($\leq$10 $R_\text{WD}$); such
a feature could be explained by inefficient spreading or the proximity of the
tidal disruption radius to the sublimation radius. The models have a
half-opening angle of $\geq$1.4$^\circ$. Such structure would be in strong
contradiction with the commonly employed flat-disk model analogous to the rings
of Saturn, and in line with the vertical structure of main-sequence debris
disks. Our results are consistent with the idea that disks are collisionally
active and continuously fed with new material, rather than evolving passively
after the disintegration of a single planetesimal.

stellar populations to the Sun. This association has recently been linked to
the Tuc-Hor, Carina, and Columba associations, building an extensive ""Austral

addition to new spectroscopic observations, we perform the deepest survey of FH
to date, identifying over 300 candidate members, nearly doubling the known

recovers new definitions for FH, Tuc-Hor, Columba, and Carina, while also
revealing a connection between the Austral complex and the Sco-Cen-affiliated

ages and tracing stellar populations back to formation reveals two distinct

protostars. The goal of this work is to investigate whether high-mass disks can
explain the lack of methanol emission from some massive protostellar systems.
We consider an envelope-only and an envelope-plus-disk model and use RADMC-3D
to calculate the methanol emission. High and low millimeter (mm) opacity dust
are considered for both models separately and the methanol abundance is
parameterized. Viscous heating is included due to the high accretion rates of
these objects in the disk. In contrast with low-mass protostars, the presence
of a disk does not significantly affect the temperature structure and methanol
emission. The shadowing effect of the disk is not as important for high-mass
objects and the disk mid-plane is hot because of viscous heating, which is
effective due to the high accretion rates. Consistent with observations of
infrared absorption lines toward high-mass protostars, we find a vertical
temperature inversion, i.e. higher temperatures in the disk mid-plane than the
disk surface, at radii < 50au for the models with $L=10^4$ L$_{\odot}$ and
large mm opacity dust as long as the envelope mass is >550 M$_{\odot}$. The
large observed scatter in methanol emission from massive protostars can be
mostly explained toward lower luminosity objects with the envelope-plus-disk
models including low and high mm opacity dust. The methanol emission variation
toward sources with high luminosities cannot be explained by models with or
without a disk. However, the $L/M$ of these objects suggest that they could be
associated with hypercompact/ultracompact HII regions. Therefore, the low
methanol emission toward the high-luminosity sources can be explained by them
hosting an HII region where methanol is absent.

Fan, Han and Lv (2022) introduced a general framework of statistical inference
on membership profiles in large networks (SIMPLE) for testing the sharp null
hypothesis that a pair of given nodes share the same membership profiles. In
real applications, there are often groups of nodes under investigation that may
share similar membership profiles at the presence of relatively weaker signals
than the setting considered in SIMPLE. To address these practical challenges,
in this paper we propose a SIMPLE method with random coupling (SIMPLE-RC) for
testing the non-sharp null hypothesis that a group of given nodes share similar
(not necessarily identical) membership profiles under weaker signals. Utilizing
the idea of random coupling, we construct our test as the maximum of the SIMPLE
tests for subsampled node pairs from the group. Such technique reduces
significantly the correlation among individual SIMPLE tests while largely
maintaining the power, enabling delicate analysis on the asymptotic
distributions of the SIMPLE-RC test. Our method and theory cover both the cases
with and without node degree heterogeneity. These new theoretical developments
are empowered by a second-order expansion of spiked eigenvectors under the
$\ell_\infty$-norm, built upon our work for random matrices with weak spikes.
Our theoretical results and the practical advantages of the newly suggested
method are demonstrated through several simulation and real data examples.

agreement after several MS interactions as quantified by the reduced

about an RF operation of copper components at cryogenic temperatures. A focus

test cavity was built from bulk copper, with a top-lid from copper-plated
stainless steel. The quality - factor measurements were performed in a liquid
helium cryostat during the warming up phase of the cavity.The cavity was at
first measured after just polishing the bulk copper surface. In the next step
this surface was copper-plated. After annealing for one hour at 400 deg
Celsius, cavity measurements were repeated. A geometric model based on a
spherical Fermi - surface and using the equivalent skin-layer model allows to
calculate the real part of the surface impedance, which is relevant for the RF
power losses in the cavity walls. An exact solution for this conduction
electron model in skin layers was derived. It is compared with measurements and
with predictions from the traditional diffusion model as formulated by Reuter,
Sondheimer and Chambers. An ion linear accelerator with copper cavities
operated at cryogenic temperatures around 40 deg Celsius is discussed: An
overall advantage in case of low repetition rate, short pulse linear

its re-establishment following its interaction with obstacles was investigated
using high resolution numerical simulation. The main focus was on the role of
the transverse detonation on the re-establishment of the detonation wave. We
applied an efficient thermochemically derived four-step global combustion model
using an Euler simulation framework to investigate the critical regimes
present. While past attempts at using one- or two- step models have failed to
capture transverse detonations, for this scenario, our simulations have
demonstrated that the four-step combustion model is able to capture this
feature. We suggest that to correctly model detonation re-initiation in
characteristically unstable mixtures, an applied combustion model should
contain at least an adequate description to permit the correct ignition and
state variable response when changes in temperature and pressure occur. Our
simulations reveal that there is a relationship between the critical outcomes
possible and the mixture cell size, and while pockets of unburned gas may exist
when a detonation re-initiates, it is not the direct rapid consumption of these
pockets that gives rise to transverse detonations. Instead, the transverse
detonations are initiated through pressure amplification of reaction zones at
burned/unburned gas interfaces whose combustion rates have been enhanced
through Richmyer-Meshkov instabilities associated with the passing of
transverse shock waves, or by spontaneous ignition of hot spots, which can form
into detonations through the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism. In both situations,
non-uniform ignition delay times are found to play a role. Finally, we found
that the transverse detonations are in fact Chapman-Jouguet detonations, but
whose presence contributes to overdriving the re-initiated detonation along the
Mach stem.

answer two questions: (1) Do PLMs learn to become calibrated in the training
process? (2) How effective are existing calibration methods? For the first
question, we conduct fine-grained control experiments to study the dynamic
change in PLMs' calibration performance in training. We consider six factors as
control variables, including dataset difficulty, available training samples,
training steps, the number of tunable parameters, model scale, and pretraining.
We observe a consistent change in calibration performance across six factors.
We find that PLMs don't learn to become calibrated in training, evidenced by
the continual increase in confidence, no matter whether the predictions are
correct or not. We highlight that our finding somewhat contradicts two
established conclusions: (a) Larger PLMs are more calibrated; (b) Pretraining
improves model calibration. Next, we study the effectiveness of existing
calibration methods in mitigating the overconfidence issue. Besides unlearnable
calibration methods (e.g., label smoothing), we adapt and extend two recently
proposed learnable methods that directly collect data to train models to have
reasonable confidence estimations. Experimental results show that learnable
methods significantly reduce PLMs' confidence in wrong predictions. The code is

requires tracking both hierarchical syntactic structures and the inherent
gender of lexical units. Our model is able to reliably predict long-distance

noun-passive-verb agreement. The model showed more inaccuracies on plural noun
phrases with gender attractors compared to singular cases, suggesting a
reliance on clues from gendered articles for agreement. Overall, our study

in the chiral limit of massless $u$ and $d$ quarks. At NLO, there are four
quark self-energy diagrams and six gluon-exchange diagrams. Nonlocal
divergences were cancelled using diagrammatic renormalization. Dimensionally
regularized integrals were numerically computed using pySecDec. The combination
of pySecDec with diagrammatic renormalization establishes a valuable new
methodology for NLO calculations of QCD correlation functions. Compared to
leading-order (LO) perturbation theory, we found that NLO perturbation theory
is significant. To quantify the impact of NLO perturbation theory on physical
predictions, we computed NLO perturbative contributions to QCD Laplace,
Gaussian, and finite-energy sum rules. Using QCD sum rules, we determined upper
and lower bounds on the $0^{+-}$, $d u\bar d\bar u$ tetraquark ground-state
mass, $M$: at NLO in perturbation theory, we found $2.2~\text{GeV}\lesssim
M\leq 4.2~\text{GeV}$ whereas, at LO, we found $2.4~\text{GeV}\lesssim M\leq
4.6~\text{GeV}$. This mass range suggests the possibility of mixing between
$0^{+-}$, light-quark (i.e., $u$ and $d$ quarks) hybrid and $d u\bar d\bar u$
tetraquark states. Taking into account uncertainties in QCD parameters, we
found no evidence for a $0^{+-}$, $d u\bar d\bar u$ tetraquark under 1.9 GeV.

an input signal into a nonlinear dynamical system defined in a higher
dimensional space. Reservoirs are characterized by nonlinear interactions among
their units and their ability to store information through recurrent loops,
allowing to train artificial systems to learn task-specific dynamics. However,
it is fundamentally unknown how the random topology of the reservoir affects
the learning performance. Here, we fill this gap by considering a battery of
synthetic networks -- characterized by different topological features -- and 45
empirical connectomes -- sampled from brain regions of organisms belonging to 8
different species -- to build the reservoir and testing the learning
performance against a prediction task with a variety of complex input signals.
We find nontrivial correlations between RC performances and both the number of
nodes and rank of the covariance matrix of activation states, with performance
depending on the nature -- stochastic or deterministic -- of input signals.
Remarkably, the modularity and the link density of the reservoir are found to
affect RC performances: these results cannot be predicted by models only
accounting for simple topological features of the reservoir. Overall, our
findings highlight that the complex topological features characterizing
biophysical computing systems such as connectomes can be used to design

the lens of exogenous information, i.e, any control-irrelevant information

contemporary representation learning techniques can fail on datasets where the

applications. To address these, we propose to use multi-step inverse models,

highly required in Poisson's ratio imaging and elasticity reconstruction, has a
poor quality. The main causes include low sampling frequency, limited motion,
and lack of phase information in the lateral direction. Recently, physically
inspired constraint in unsupervised regularized elastography (PICTURE) has been
proposed. This method took into account the range of the feasible lateral
strain defined by the rules of physics of motion and employed a regularization
strategy to improve the lateral strains. Despite the substantial improvement,
the regularization was only applied during the training; hence it did not
guarantee during the test that the lateral strain is within the feasible range.
Furthermore, only the feasible range was employed, other constraints such as
incompressibility were not investigated. In this paper, we address these two
issues and propose kPICTURE in which two iterative algorithms were infused into
the network architecture in the form of known operators to ensure the lateral

However, the non-Hermiticity of the TC Hamiltonians poses challenges for
variational methods like DMRG. Imaginary-time evolution on the matrix product

but this is currently limited to treating the ground state, and has lower

end-to-end speech recognition (ASR) that incorporates a 2nd-pass rescoring
model on top of the conventional 1st-pass streaming ASR model to improve
recognition accuracy while keeping latency low. One of the latest 2nd-pass
rescoring model, Transformer Rescorer, takes the n-best initial outputs and
audio embeddings from the 1st-pass model, and then choose the best output by
re-scoring the n-best initial outputs. However, training this Transformer
Rescorer requires expensive paired audio-text training data because the model
uses audio embeddings as input. In this work, we present our Joint Audio/Text
training method for Transformer Rescorer, to leverage unpaired text-only data
which is relatively cheaper than paired audio-text data. We evaluate
Transformer Rescorer with our Joint Audio/Text training on Librispeech dataset
as well as our large-scale in-house dataset and show that our training method
can improve word error rate (WER) significantly compared to standard
Transformer Rescorer without requiring any extra model parameters or latency.

a game-theoretic framework for federated learning that learns causal features
that are invariant across clients. While training to achieve the Nash
equilibrium, the traditional best response strategy suffers from high-frequency
oscillations. We demonstrate that FL GAMES effectively resolves this challenge
and exhibits smooth performance curves. Further, FL GAMES scales well in the
number of clients, requires significantly fewer communication rounds, and is
agnostic to device heterogeneity. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate
that FL GAMES achieves high out-of-distribution performance on various

inspired by the recently proposed three point compressor (3PC) framework of
Richtarik et al. (2022), which includes error feedback (EF21), lazily
aggregated gradient (LAG), and their combination as special cases, and offers
the current state-of-the-art rates for these methods under weak assumptions.
While the above mechanisms offer a fixed compression level, or adapt between
two extremes only, our proposal is to perform a much finer adaptation. In
particular, we allow the user to choose any number of arbitrarily chosen
contractive compression mechanisms, such as Top-K sparsification with a
user-defined selection of sparsification levels K, or quantization with a
user-defined selection of quantization levels, or their combination. AdaCGD
chooses the appropriate compressor and compression level adaptively during the
optimization process. Besides i) proposing a theoretically-grounded
multi-adaptive communication compression mechanism, we further ii) extend the
3PC framework to bidirectional compression, i.e., we allow the server to
compress as well, and iii) provide sharp convergence bounds in the strongly
convex, convex and nonconvex settings. The convex regime results are new even
for several key special cases of our general mechanism, including 3PC and EF21.
In all regimes, our rates are superior compared to all existing adaptive
compression methods.

Traditional multi-layered artificial skins require complex manufacturing

approach to predict positions of point loads using the most direct response as
input signal: strain distribution. Starting with the simplest problem,
predicting the position of a single point load acting on a flat surface, an ML
model is developed, trained, and tested. Accurate predictions are obtained from
the ML model, parameters that affect the accuracy are discussed, and validation
tests are performed. After that, the ML model is modified to solve
multi-objective prediction problems: predicting positions and magnitudes of
multiple point loads. In the end, the ML model is upgraded to a 2-step model to
predict the position of a point load acting on a deformable surface. The
demonstrated approach enables a normal untreated surface to feel a touch no
matter what the surface is made of or how large or small the size of the

are only beginning to be elucidated. Understanding the underlying physical
mechanisms of the structure-property relationships is the key to designing
bioinspired materials. The eggshell is an excellent example because many design
trade-offs are well balanced by its seemingly simple but highly evolved
structures. The first design trade-off: to break an eggshell, the internal
breaking load needed is much lower than the external breaking load. The reason
is that the dome-shaped structure leads to a special stress distribution which
inhibits the propagation of the first crack. The second design trade-off: the
eggshell is tough during the incubation but weakened at the time of hatching.
The membrane of the eggshell significantly improves the toughness by bridging
the primary crack and creating more secondary cracks. Moreover, the moisture
content-controlled property of the membrane makes the toughness of the eggshell
tunable. The third design trade-off: the eggshell must be thick enough to
withstand the external forces, but the supply of the building material calcium
is limited. The proposed three-index model indicates that the driving force in
the evolution of eggshell thickness could be the balance between the protection
and nutrient consumption to maximize survivability. The general methodologies
presented here hold great potential for the development of eggshell-inspired
structural materials that can be used in sports safety applications and the

streamline data wrangling. An AI assistant guides the analyst through a
specific data wrangling task by recommending a suitable data transformation
that respects the constraints obtained through interaction with the analyst.
  We formally define the structure of AI assistants and describe how existing
tools that treat data cleaning as an optimization problem fit the definition.
We implement AI assistants for four common data wrangling tasks and make AI
assistants easily accessible to data analysts in an open-source notebook
environment for data science, by leveraging the common structure they follow.
We evaluate our AI assistants both quantitatively and qualitatively through
three example scenarios. We show that the unified and interactive design makes
it easy to perform tasks that would be difficult to do manually or with a fully
automatic tool.

ALMA2030 Development Roadmap. The WSU will initially double, and eventually
quadruple, ALMA's system bandwidth and will deliver improved sensitivity by
upgrading the receivers, digital electronics and correlator. The WSU will
afford significant improvements for every future ALMA observation, whether it
is for continuum or spectral line science. The continuum imaging speed will
increase by a factor of 3 for the 2x bandwidth upgrade, plus any gains from
improved receiver temperatures. The spectral line imaging speed will improve by
a factor of 2-3. The improvements provided by the WSU will be most dramatic for
high spectral resolution observations, where the instantaneous bandwidth
correlated at 0.1-0.2 km/s resolution will increase by 1-2 orders of magnitude
in most receiver bands. The improved sensitivity and spectral tuning grasp will
open new avenues of exploration and enable more efficient observations. The
impact will span the vast array of topics that embodies ALMA's motto ""In Search
of our Cosmic Origins"". The WSU will greatly expand the chemical inventory of
protoplanetary disks, which will have profound implications for how and when
planets form. Observations of the interstellar medium will measure a variety of
molecular species to build large samples of clouds, cores and protostars. The
WSU will also enable efficient surveys of galaxies at high redshift. The first
elements of the WSU will be available later this decade, including a wideband
Band 2 receiver, a wideband upgrade to Band 6, new digitizers and digital
transmission system, and a new correlator. Other upgrades are under study,
including the newly developed ACA spectrometer and upgrades to Bands 9 and 10.
The gains enabled by the WSU will further enhance ALMA as the world leading

algorithm employs a second-order digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter
to perform an approximate per-pixel brightness reconstruction and is more
robust to high-frequency noise than the baseline method we compare to. We
further demonstrate that using the falling edge of the signal leads to more
accurate period estimates than the rising edge, and that for certain signals
interpolating the zero-level crossings can further increase accuracy. Our
experiments find that the outstanding capabilities of the camera in detecting

to its work-conserving nature, can become unstable in the presence of
non-persistent users. Consequently, for any provably stable protocol, many
peers, at some point, would have to be endogenously forced to hold off their
file-download activity. In this work, we propose a tunable piece-selection
policy that minimizes this (undesirable) requisite by combining the
(work-conserving but not stabilizing) rarest-first protocol with only an
appropriate share of the (non-work conserving and stabilizing) mode-suppression
protocol. We refer to this policy as ``Rarest-First with Probabilistic
Mode-Suppression'' or simply RFwPMS. We study RFwPMS using a stochastic
abstraction of the BitTorrent network that is general enough to capture a
multiple swarm setting of non-persistent users -- each swarm having its own
altruistic preferences that may or may not overlap with those of other swarms.
Using Lyapunov drift analysis, we show that for all kinds of inter-swarm
behaviors and all arrival-rate configurations, RFwPMS is stable. Then, using
the Kingman's moment bound technique, we further show that the expected
steady-state sojourn time of RFwPMS is independent of the arrival-rate in the
single-swarm case (under a mild additional assumption). Finally, our
simulation-based performance evaluation confirms our theoretical findings and
shows that the steady-state expected sojourn time is linear in the file-size
(compared to our loose estimate of a polynomial with degree 6). Overall, an
improved performance is observed in comparison to previously proposed
stabilizing schemes like mode-suppression (MS).

The orbits of large
particles are mainly governed by Martian gravity, while those of small
particles could be significantly affected by non-gravitational forces. Many of
the previous studies of particle dynamics around Mars have focused on
relatively small particles (radius of $r_{\rm p} \lesssim 100 \, \mu m$) for
$\lesssim 10^{4}$ years. In this paper, using direct numerical orbital
integration and analytical approaches, we consider Martian gravity, Martian
$J_{2}$, the solar radiation pressure (SRP) and the Poynting-Robertson (PR)
force to study the giga-year dynamical evolution of particles orbiting near the
Martian equatorial plane with radius ranging from micrometer to meter. We also
newly study the effect of the planetary shadow upon the particle dynamics. Our
results show that small particles ($r_{\rm p} \lesssim 10 \, \mu m$) initially
at $\lesssim 8$ Martian radii (below the orbit of today's Deimos) are quickly
removed by the SRP due to eccentricity increase, resulting in a collision with
Mars at the pericenter distnace. The orbits of larger particles ($r_{\rm p} >
10 \, \mu m$) slowly decay due to the PR forces (timescale of $> 10^{4}$
years). The planetary shadow reduces the sunlit area in the orbit and thus the
efficiency of the PR drag force is reduced. However, we show that, even
including the planetary shadow, particles up to $\sim 10$ cm in radius,
initially at $\lesssim 8$ Martian radii, eventually spiral onto the Martian
surface within $\sim 10^{9}$ years. Smaller particles require less time to
reach Mars, and vice versa. Our results would be important to better understand

existing ISAC beamforming design by considering the FD capability for both
radar and communication. Specifically, we consider an ISAC system, where the BS
performs target detection and communicates with multiple downlink users and
uplink users reusing the same time and frequency resources. We jointly optimize
the downlink dual-functional transmit signal and the uplink receive beamformers
at the BS and the transmit power at the uplink users. The problems are
formulated under two criteria: power consumption minimization and sum rate
maximization. The downlink and uplink transmissions are tightly coupled due to
both the desired target echo and the undesired interference received at the BS,
making the problems challenging. To handle these issues in both cases, we first
determine the optimal receive beamformers, which are derived in closed forms
with respect to the BS transmit beamforming and the user transmit power, for
radar target detection and uplink communications, respectively. Subsequently,
we invoke these results to obtain equivalent optimization problems and propose
efficient iterative algorithms to solve them by using the techniques of rank
relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA), where the adopted
relaxation is proven to be tight. In addition, we consider a special case under

and a remotely accessible method for (hidden) emotion detection from videos of
human faces. Our approach combines face manifold detection for accurate
location of the face in the video with local face manifold embedding to create
a common domain for the measurements of muscle micro-movements that is
invariant to the movement of the subject in the video. In the next step, we
employ the Digital Image Speckle Correlation (DISC) and the optical flow
algorithm to compute the pattern of micro-movements in the face. The
corresponding vector field is mapped back to the original space and
superimposed on the original frames of the videos. Hence, the resulting videos
include additional information about the direction of the movement of the
muscles in the face. We take the publicly available CK++ dataset of visible
emotions and add to it videos of the same format but with hidden emotions. We
process all the videos using our micro-movement detection and use the results
to train a state-of-the-art network for emotions classification from videos --
Frame Attention Network (FAN). Although the original FAN model achieves very
high out-of-sample performance on the original CK++ videos, it does not perform
so well on hidden emotions videos. The performance improves significantly when
the model is trained and tested on videos with the vector fields of muscle
movements. Intuitively, the corresponding arrows serve as edges in the image
that are easily captured by the convolutions filters in the FAN network.

a new two-parameter model that estimates both age and a constant erosion rate

crater count data collected from Context Camera imagery for both the MFF and
other young equatorial sedimentary rock. Based on our new model, the Central
MFF formed $>$1.5 Gyr ago and had low erosion rates ($<$650 nm yr$^{-1}$),
whereas the East MFF, Far East MFF, and Zephyria Planum most likely formed
$<$1.5 Gyr ago and had higher erosion rates ($>$740 nm $^{-1}$). The top of
Aeolis Mons (informally known as Mount Sharp) in Gale Crater and Eastern Candor
have relatively young ages and low erosion rates. Based on the estimated
erosion rates (since fast erosion permits metastable shallow ice), we also
identify several sites, including Zephyria Planum, as plausible locations for
shallow subsurface equatorial water ice that is detectable by gamma-ray
spectroscopy or neutron spectroscopy. In addition to confirming $<$1.5 Gyr
sedimentary rock formations on Mars, and distinguishing older and younger MFF
sites, we find that fast-eroding locations have younger ages and MFF locations
with slower erosion have older best-fit ages.

between different astrophysical feedback models, account for baryons that

using locally-anisotropic tSZ statistics as cosmological probes. This study
seeks to guide such future measurements by analysing whether diffuse
intergalactic gas is a major contributor to anisotropic tSZ signal in The Three
Hundred GIZMO-Simba hydrodynamic simulations. Various definitions are applied
to divide concentrated from diffuse gas at $z=1$ and create mock Compton-$y$

centred on massive galaxy clusters, oriented by the most prominent galaxy
filament axis, and stacked. Results vary significantly depending on the

cases, the diffuse gas is important, contributing 25-60% of the tSZ signal in
the far field ($>4 h^{-1}$ comoving Mpc) from the stacked clusters. The gas 1-2
virial radii from halo centres is especially key. Oriented stacking and
environmental selections help to amplify the signal from the warm-hot

radio lobes (main radio lobes and ""wings""), one of the promising models for the
peculiar morphology is jet re-orientation. To clarify it, we conducted the
European VLBI Network (EVN) 5 GHz observation of an XRG J0725+5835, which
resembles the archetypal binary AGNs 0402+379 in radio morphology but it is
larger in angular size. In our observation, two milliarcsec (mas) scale radio
components with non-thermal radio emission are detected, each of them coincides
with an optical counterpart with similar photometric redshift and (optical and
infrared) magnitude, corresponding to dual active nuclei. Furthermore, with the
improved VLA images, we find a bridge between the two radio cores and a jet
bending in the region surrounding the companion galaxy, which further supports
the interplay between the main and companion galaxies. In addition, we also
report the discovery of an arcsec-scale jet in the companion. Given the
projected separation of $\sim100$ kpc between the main and companion galaxies,
XRG J0725+5835 is likely associated with a dual jetted-AGN system. In both EVN
and VLA observations, we find signatures that the jet is changing its
direction, which is likely responsible for the X-shaped morphology. On the
origin of jet re-orientation, several scenarios are discussed.

first approach computes the confidential message (CM) beamforming vector by
maximizing the SR, and the signal-to-leakage-noise ratio (SLNR) method is used
to optimize the IRS phase shift matrix, which is called Max-SR-SLNR. Here, Eve
is maximally interfered by transmitting artificial noise (AN) along the direct
path and null-space projection (NSP) on the remaining two channels. To reduce
the computational complexity, the CM, AN beamforming and IRS phase shift design
are independently designed in the following methods. The CM beamforming vector
is constructed based on maximum ratio transmission (MRT) criteria along the
channel from Alice-to-IRS, and phase shift matrix of IRS is directly given by
phase alignment (PA) method. This method is called MRT-NSP-PA. Simulation
results show that the SR performance of the Max-SR-SLNR method outperforms the
MRT-NSP-PA method in the cases of small-scale and medium-scale IRSs, and the
latter approaches the former in performance as IRS tends to lager-scale.

design provides a sequential approach for designing multi-fidelity runs such

conditions. We then prove a novel cost complexity theorem which, under this

cost (for training data simulation) needed to ensure a prediction bound of
$\epsilon$. This result provides novel insights on conditions under which the
proposed multi-fidelity approach improves upon a standard Gaussian process

expensive manual cost to check the label. Therefore, test case prioritization

cases to solve the problem of scenario limitation. Without mutation operations,
ActGraph is easy to implement, leading to lower time complexity. Extensive

following key characteristics. (i) Effectiveness and generalizability: ActGraph
shows competitive performance in all of the natural, adversarial and mixed

interest for quantum simulations of many body systems, optical clocks, and

that can be continuously tuned from a standard Airy focus to a subwavelength
hotspot smaller than the usual Abbe's diffraction limit. The hotspot was
generated using the effect of superoscillations, by the precise interference of
multiple free-space coherent waves. We characterized the superoscillatory
optical trap by measuring the atom effective temperature, lifetime, and the

cause massive losses. Therefore, a quick and accurate anomaly detection (AD)

learning the relations among different variables has been explored by many
approaches. However, most of the existing approaches do not consider the
heterogeneity between variables, that is, different types of variables
(continuous numerical variables, discrete categorical variables or hybrid
variables) may have different and distinctive edge distributions. In this
paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection framework based on
a heterogeneous feature network (HFN) for MTS, learning heterogeneous structure
information from a mass of unlabeled time-series data to improve the accuracy
of anomaly detection, and using attention coefficient to provide an explanation
for the detected anomalies. Specifically, we first combine the embedding
similarity subgraph generated by sensor embedding and feature value similarity
subgraph generated by sensor values to construct a time-series heterogeneous
graph, which fully utilizes the rich heterogeneous mutual information among
variables. Then, a prediction model containing nodes and channel attentions is
jointly optimized to obtain better time-series representations. This approach
fuses the state-of-the-art technologies of heterogeneous graph structure
learning (HGSL) and representation learning. The experiments on four sensor
datasets from real-world applications demonstrate that our approach detects the
anomalies more accurately than those baseline approaches, thus providing a
basis for the rapid positioning of anomalies.

that originate in the wind. These winds are radiatively driven and are
susceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities that result in the formation of
clumps. When modelling spectra of WR stars the volume-filling factor (VFF)
approach is usually employed to treat clumpy winds. However, it is based on the
assumption that the entire wind mass resides in optically thin clumps, which is
not necessarily justifiable in dense winds. To test the validity of the VFF
approach we use a previously described method of treating clumping, the
``Shell'' approach, to study line and continuum formation in the dense wind of
the WN4 star, HD 50896. Our models indicate that fully intact spherical shells
are in tension with observed spectra; a persistent ``dip'' in emission lines
occurs at line centre. Removing this dip requires our models to use ``broken''
shells -- shells that are highly decoherent laterally. This insinuates that the
wind of HD 50896, and by extension the winds of other WR stars, are comprised
of small laterally confined and radially compressed clumps -- clumps smaller
than the Sobolev length. We discuss some of the conditions necessary for the
VFF approach to be valid.

in the dark shadow of BH, we in this paper explore the influence of the fixed

BH shadow increases as the axion-plasmon coupling gets strong. Interestingly,
our analysis indicates that as the mass of axion gets heavier, it can leave a
subtle imprint of itself on the shadow. Conversely, in the non-rotating limit
(Schwarzschild), by recovering the spherical symmetry of the shadow shape of
BH, its size decreases. In coordination with the trend of change in shadow
size, the investigation of the energy emission from the BH surrounded by the
magnetized plasma shows that the maximal energy emission rate from the rotating

subtask, nested-from-flat NER, which corresponds to a realistic application
scenario: given data annotated with flat entities only, one may still desire
the trained model capable of recognizing nested entities. To address this task,
we train span-based models and deliberately ignore the spans nested inside
labeled entities, since these spans are possibly unlabeled entities. With
nested entities removed from the training data, our model achieves 54.8%, 54.2%

entities in the test set of CoNLL 2003, creating a nested-from-flat NER

learning techniques (MAE, SKD, Cross, BYOL, and, SimSiam). We conduct
quantitative evaluations on an open lung X-ray image dataset as well as masking
ratio hyperparameter studies. Results: When using the entire training set,
RGMIM outperformed other comparable methods, achieving a 0.962 lung disease
detection accuracy. Specifically, RGMIM significantly improved performance in
small data volumes, such as 5% and 10% of the training set (846 and 1,693
images) compared to other methods, and achieved a 0.957 detection accuracy even
when only 50% of the training set was used. Conclusions: RGMIM can mask more
valid regions, facilitating the learning of discriminative representations and
the subsequent high-accuracy lung disease detection. RGMIM outperforms other
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in experiments, particularly
when limited training data is used.

application to the Murine model for Melioidosis data. The two-parameter
logistic exponential distribution is assumed as a lifetime distribution.
Weighted minimum density power divergence estimators (WMDPDEs) for robust
parameter estimation are obtained along with the conventional maximum
likelihood estimators (MLEs). The asymptotic behaviour of the WMDPDEs and
testing of the hypothesis based on it are also studied. The performances of
estimators are evaluated through extensive simulation experiments. Later those

importance of knowing exactly when to inspect the one-shot devices put to test,
a search for optimum inspection times is performed. This optimization is
designed to minimize a defined cost function which strikes a trade-off between
the precision of the estimation and experimental cost. The search is performed

in the frequency domain by iteratively linearisation and minimisation of the

associated with each frequency interval is solved by an implicit and iterative
inversion of the Hessian matrix (inner iterations). Instead, this study applies
a preconditioning approach on each linear subproblem so that the Hessian matrix
becomes diagonalised, and can thus be inverted in a single step. Using the
proposed preconditioning approach, the computational cost of solving each
linear subproblem of the proposed ray-Born inversion approach becomes almost
the same as solving one linear subproblem associated with a radon-type
time-of-flight-based approach using bent rays. More importantly, the smoothness
assumptions made for diagonalising the Hessian matrix make the image
reconstruction more stable than the inversion approach in [3] to noise.

numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in strong magnetic
fields, where the density of states for itinerary electrons at the chemical
potential varies discontinuously as the magnetic field changes. We first
examine phases of many-body ground states in the presence of single impurity.
By investigating change of $z$-component of total spin, $\Delta S_z$, and
spin-spin correlation between the impurity and conduction electrons, we find
that there are three states competing for the ground state when Zeeman
splitting is present. One of the states is doublet in which the impurity spin
is unscreened. The other two states are Kondo screening states with $\Delta
S_z=1/2$ and $\Delta S_z=1$, in which the impurity spin is partially screened
and completely screened respectively. For Kondo systems with two-impurities in
strong magnetic fields, we find that the interplay between the Kondo screening
effect, RKKY interaction, and quantum oscillations due to Landau levels
determines the ground state of the system. Combination of these three factors
results in different screening scenarios for different phases in which spins of
two impurities can form spin-0 or spin-1 states, while impurity spins in these
phases can be either screened, partially screened, or unscreened by conduction
electrons. The emergence of the ground state from these competing states
oscillates with the change of magnetic field, chemical potential or
inter-impurity distance. This leads to quantum oscillations in magnetization
and conductivity. In particular, we find extra peak structures in longitudinal
conductivity that reflect changes of Kondo screening phases and are important
features to be observed in experiments. Our results provide a complete
characterization of phases for Kondo effect in strong magnetic fields.

frameworks in NLP for latent representation learning and latent-directed

Lower Bound (ELBo), which consists of a conditional likelihood for generation
and a negative Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for regularization. In
practice, optimizing ELBo often leads the posterior distribution of all samples
converge to the same degenerated local optimum, namely posterior collapse or KL
vanishing. There are effective ways proposed to prevent posterior collapse in
VAEs, but we observe that they in essence make trade-offs between posterior
collapse and hole problem, i.e., mismatch between the aggregated posterior
distribution and the prior distribution. To this end, we introduce new training
objectives to tackle both two problems through a novel regularization based on
the probabilistic density gap between the aggregated posterior distribution and
the prior distribution. Through experiments on language modeling, latent space
visualization and interpolation, we show that our proposed method can solve

through the process of denoising. However, the theoretical understanding of why
diffusion models are able to improve the certified robustness is still lacking,
preventing from further improvement. In this study, we close this gap by
analyzing the fundamental properties of diffusion models and establishing the
conditions under which they can enhance certified robustness. This deeper
understanding allows us to propose a new method DensePure, designed to improve
the certified robustness of a pretrained model (i.e. classifier). Given an
(adversarial) input, DensePure consists of multiple runs of denoising via the
reverse process of the diffusion model (with different random seeds) to get
multiple reversed samples, which are then passed through the classifier,
followed by majority voting of inferred labels to make the final prediction.
This design of using multiple runs of denoising is informed by our theoretical
analysis of the conditional distribution of the reversed sample. Specifically,
when the data density of a clean sample is high, its conditional density under
the reverse process in a diffusion model is also high; thus sampling from the
latter conditional distribution can purify the adversarial example and return
the corresponding clean sample with a high probability. By using the highest
density point in the conditional distribution as the reversed sample, we
identify the robust region of a given instance under the diffusion model's
reverse process. We show that this robust region is a union of multiple convex
sets, and is potentially much larger than the robust regions identified in
previous works. In practice, DensePure can approximate the label of the high
density region in the conditional distribution so that it can enhance certified
robustness.

is to facilitate feature sampling rate exchange, realizing the quality of the
transformed features for the one kind to be measured in another space, with
diversified objective functions. As a result, the speech representations are
enriched with more linguistic information, while the representations generated
by the text encoder are more similar to corresponding speech ones, and
therefore the shared ASR models are more amenable for unpaired text data
pretraining. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we perform two
categories of experiments with or without extra unpaired text data.

$n$-node graph with storage (i.e., node memory). Generally, a system with
one-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage is as powerful as that with
$O(n)$-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage. Thus, we focus on the
difference between one-bit memory and oblivious (i.e., zero-bit memory) agents.
Although their computational powers are not equivalent, all the known results
exhibiting such a difference rely on the fact that oblivious agents cannot
transfer any information from one side to the other across the bridge edge.
Hence, our main question is as follows: Are the computational powers of one-bit
memory and oblivious agents equivalent in 2-edge-connected graphs or not? The
main contribution of this study is to answer this question under the relaxed
assumption that each node has $O(\log\Delta)$-bit storage (where $\Delta$ is
the maximum degree of the graph). We present an algorithm for simulating any
algorithm for a single one-bit memory agent using an oblivious agent with
$O(n^2)$-time overhead per round. Our results imply that the topological
structure of graphs differentiating the computational powers of oblivious and
non-oblivious agents is completely characterized by the existence of bridge
edges.

crystalline order and chaotic randomness at two extreme values of the system
parameter. This pattern is the outcome of non-linear self-organization, which
leads to a new class of turbulent flow - active turbulence. We claim that this

micro-swimmers. The model described in this letter can be a prototypical model
for understanding active systems and may shed light on the possibility of
making novel materials(active matter) with exciting biomedical and industrial

aspirational trait, synonymous with harmony and ideality. The arithmetic
average has often been used to characterize normality, and is often used both
productively and unproductively as a blunt way to characterize samples and
outliers. A number of prior commentaries in the fields of psychology and social
science have highlighted the need for caution when reducing complex phenomena
to a single mean value. However, to the best of our knowledge, none have
described and explained why the mean provides such a poor characterization of
normality, particularly in the context of multi-dimensionality and outlier
detection. We demonstrate that even for datasets with a relatively low number
of dimensions ($<10$), data start to exhibit a number of peculiarities which
become progressively severe as the number of dimensions increases. The
availability of large, multi-dimensional datasets is increasing, and it is
therefore especially important that researchers understand the peculiar
characteristics of such data. We show that normality can be better
characterized with `typicality', an information theoretic concept relating to
the entropy of a distribution. An application of typicality to both synthetic
and real-world data reveals that in multi-dimensional space, to be normal (or
close to the mean) is actually to be highly atypical. This motivates us to
update our working definition of an outlier, and we demonstrate typicality for
outlier detection as a viable method which is consistent with this updated
definition. In contrast, whilst the popular Mahalanobis based outlier detection
method can be used to identify points far from the mean, it fails to identify
those which are too close. Typicality can be used to achieve both, and performs
well regardless of the dimensionality of the problem.

for 1G stars. Principle results derived by analytic and one-zone models of GC
formation are as follows. The mass fraction of 2G stars (f_2g) can be higher
than ~0.4 for alpha < 1.8 and is not so dependent on f_b. The ratio of the
initial mass of a GC to the present-day mass (M_gc) ranges from 2 to 7
depending on alpha for 0.5 < f_b <0.9. The differences in [Na/Fe] between 1G
and 2G stars can be as large as 0.7 for a wide range of model parameters. The
Li abundances of 2G stars can be as high as those of 1G even if the pristine
gas from IMCBs is assumed to be Li-free. Formation histories of 2G stars show
at least two peaks owing to two peaks in the total ejection rate of gas from
IMCB populations. The observed correlation between f_2g and M_gc can be due to
alpha depending on M_gc. The hypothetical long duration of 2G formation (~ 10^8
yr) is possible, because massive star formation can be suppressed through
frequent dynamical interaction between 1G stars and gas clouds.

scenarios and is a challenging task due to the unbounded definition of
anomalies. Moreover, most previous methods are application-specific, and
establishing a unified model for anomalies across application scenarios remains
unsolved. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework termed Siamese
Transition Masked Autoencoders(ST-MAE) to handle various visual anomaly
detection tasks uniformly via deep feature transition. Concretely, the proposed
method first extracts hierarchical semantics features from a pre-trained deep
convolutional neural network and then develops a feature decoupling strategy to
split the deep features into two disjoint feature patch subsets. Leveraging the
decoupled features, the ST-MAE is developed with the Siamese encoders that
operate on each subset of feature patches and perform the latent
representations transition of two subsets, along with a lightweight decoder
that reconstructs the original feature from the transitioned latent
representation. Finally, the anomalous attributes can be detected using the
semantic deep feature residual. Our deep feature transition scheme yields a
nontrivial and semantic self-supervisory task to extract prototypical normal
patterns, which allows for learning uniform models that generalize well for
different visual anomaly detection tasks. The extensive experiments conducted
demonstrate that the proposed ST-MAE method can advance state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks across application scenarios with a superior
inference efficiency, which exhibits great potential to be the uniform model
for unsupervised visual anomaly detection.

this method, in combination with the Inverse Polygon Mapping technique (IPM),
to quasar microlensing to generate microlensing magnification maps with very

integrity of quantum communication systems and their dependability at risk. The
initial state of the system was a pure quantum state, but as soon as there was
any noise injected into the system, it transitioned into a mixed state. In this

opaque envelope, most of our knowledge about them and their life-giving nuclear

respectively. Only in very rare cases, stars may expose their cores, e.g., when
a tiny fraction of them evolves into Wolf-Rayet or helium hot subdwarf stars.
However, for the vast majority of stars, namely unevolved stars that burn
hydrogen to helium in their centres, direct observational clues on the cores

Sampling (MIDAS) and Dynamic Factor Models (DFM) are the two main
state-of-the-art approaches that allow modeling series with non-homogeneous
frequencies. We introduce a new framework called the Multi-Frequency Echo State
Network (MFESN), which originates from a relatively novel machine learning
paradigm called reservoir computing (RC). Echo State Networks are recurrent
neural networks with random weights and trainable readout. They are formulated
as nonlinear state-space systems with random state coefficients where only the
observation map is subject to estimation. This feature makes the estimation of
MFESNs considerably more efficient than DFMs. In addition, the MFESN modeling
framework allows to incorporate many series, as opposed to MIDAS models, which
are prone to the curse of dimensionality. Our discussion encompasses
hyperparameter tuning, penalization, and nonlinear multistep forecast
computation. In passing, a new DFM aggregation scheme with Almon exponential
structure is also presented, bridging MIDAS and dynamic factor models. All
methods are compared in extensive multistep forecasting exercises targeting US
GDP growth. We find that our ESN models achieve comparable or better

attacker can easily increase quality scores. When developers of image- and
video-algorithms can boost their scores through detached processing, algorithm
comparisons are no longer fair. Inspired by the idea of universal adversarial
perturbation for classifiers, we suggest a new method to attack differentiable
no-reference quality metrics through universal perturbation. We applied this
method to seven no-reference image- and video-quality metrics (PaQ-2-PiQ,
Linearity, VSFA, MDTVSFA, KonCept512, Nima and SPAQ). For each one, we trained
a universal perturbation that increases the respective scores. We also propose
a method for assessing metric stability and identify the metrics that are the
most vulnerable and the most resistant to our attack. The existence of
successful universal perturbations appears to diminish the metric's ability to
provide reliable scores. We therefore recommend our proposed method as an
additional verification of metric reliability to complement traditional

Nevertheless, the field has not adopted a standard way to present the results
of such calculations in an easily reproducible form. We develop a polynomial
expansion that allows for easy quantitative comparison between different
candidate wavefunctions, as well as reliable scaling of correlation and
quasihole profiles to the thermodynamic limit. We start from the well-known
expansion introduced by Girvin [PRB, 30 (1984)] (see also [Girvin, MacDonald
and Platzman, PRB, 33 (1986)]), which is physically appealing but, as we
demonstrate, numerically unstable.0 We orthogonalize their basis set to obtain
a new basis of modified Jacobi polynomials, whose coefficients can be stably
calculated. We then apply our expansion to extract pair correlation expansion
coefficients and quasihole profiles in the thermodynamic limit for a wide range
of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions. These include the Laughlin series,
composite fermion states with both reverse and direct flux attachment, the
Moore-Read Pfaffian state, and BS hierarchy states. The expansion procedure
works for both abelian and non-abelian quasiholes, even when the density at the
core is not zero. We find that the expansion coefficients for all quantum Hall
states considered can be fit remarkably well using a cosine oscillation with
exponentially decaying amplitude. The frequency and the decay length are
related in an intuitive, but not elementary way to the filling fraction.
Different states at the same filling fraction can have distinct values for
these parameters. Finally, we also use our scaled correlation functions to
calculate estimates for the magneto-roton gaps of the various states.

has revealed that developers frequently overlook this practice, resulting in
significant information loss. To address this issue, automatic link recovery
techniques have been proposed. However, these approaches primarily focused on
improving prediction accuracy on randomly-split datasets, with limited
attention given to the impact of data leakage and the generalizability of the
predictive models. LinkFormer seeks to address these limitations. Our approach
not only preserves and improves the accuracy of existing predictions but also
enhances their alignment with real-world settings and their generalizability.
First, to better utilize contextual information for prediction, we employ the
Transformer architecture and fine-tune multiple pre-trained models on both
textual and metadata information of issues and commits. Next, to gauge the
effect of time on model performance, we employ two splitting policies during
both the training and testing phases; randomly- and temporally-split datasets.
Finally, in pursuit of a generic model that can demonstrate high performance
across a range of projects, we undertake additional fine-tuning of LinkFormer
within two distinct transfer-learning settings. Our findings support that to
simulate real-world scenarios effectively, researchers must maintain the
temporal flow of data when training models. Furthermore, the results
demonstrate that LinkFormer outperforms existing methodologies by a significant
margin, achieving a 48% improvement in F1-measure within a project-based

inference have been extensively studied in the recent deep learning literature,
while the supervisions used for each task have not been fully exploited to
assist the other task. Namely, structure inference has been typically conducted
with an autoencoder that does not leverage the point-to-part associations.
Also, segmentation has been mostly performed without structural priors that
tell the plausibility of the output segments. We present how these two tasks
can be best combined while fully utilizing supervision to improve performance.
Our framework first decomposes a raw input shape into part segments using an
off-the-shelf algorithm, whose outputs are then mapped to nodes in a part
hierarchy, establishing point-to-part associations. Following this, ours
predicts the structural information, e.g., part bounding boxes and part
relationships. Lastly, the segmentation is rectified by examining the confusion
of part boundaries using the structure-based part features. Our experimental
results based on the StructureNet and PartNet demonstrate that the interplay
between the two tasks results in remarkable improvements in both tasks: 27.91%

continuous sequence of synthetic CTs generated from real MRI sequences. During
treatment, the plans for which the tumor is at a close distance to the current

and show that WBNNs vastly outperform WNNs. One reason for the vast superiority
of WBNNs is their advanced hierarchical tree structure based on biorthonormal
multiresolution analysis (MRA). Another reason for this is the implementation
of our new idea to incorporate the wavelet tree depth into the neural width of
the NN. The separation of the roles of wavelet depth and neural depth provides
a conceptually and algorithmically simple but highly efficient methodology for
sharp increase in functionality of swarm and deep WBNNs and rapid acceleration
of the machine learning process.

(SDSS) have resulted in generation of tremendous amount of data. The
classification of this enormous amount of data by astronomers is time
consuming. To simplify this process, in 2007 a volunteer-based citizen science
project called Galaxy Zoo was introduced, which has reduced the time for
classification by a good extent. However, in this modern era of deep learning,
automating this classification task is highly beneficial as it reduces the time
for classification. For the last few years, many algorithms have been proposed
which happen to do a phenomenal job in classifying galaxies into multiple
classes. But all these algorithms tend to classify galaxies into less than six
classes. However, after considering the minute information which we know about
galaxies, it is necessary to classify galaxies into more than eight classes. In
this study, a neural network model is proposed so as to classify SDSS data into
10 classes from an extended Hubble Tuning Fork. Great care is given to disc
edge and disc face galaxies, distinguishing between a variety of substructures
and minute features which are associated with each class. The proposed model
consists of convolution layers to extract features making this method fully
automatic. The achieved test accuracy is 84.73 per cent which happens to be
promising after considering such minute details in classes. Along with
convolution layers, the proposed model has three more layers responsible for
classification, which makes the algorithm consume less time.

force! The correct model for cuprates is the three band Emery model in which
oxygen p-orbitals are explicitly taken into account. The doped holes go into
these oxygen p-orbitals where they undergo charge-transfer superexchange with
unpaired electrons in copper d orbitals. This charge transfer superexchange is
the key which leads to bound pairs and superconductivity. In the experimental
verification\cite{sea}, the system chosen is $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$. What is
achieved is the direct functional dependence of the local electron pair density
($n_P(r)$) on local charge transfer energy ($\ep_{pd}(r)$) using state of the

our models, we use a variety of stellar yield sets in order to explore the
impact of varying both AGB and massive star yields on the chemical evolution of
fluorine. In particular, we investigate different prescriptions for initial
rotational velocity in massive stars as well as a metallicity dependent mix of
rotational velocities. We find that the observed [F/O] and [F/Fe] abundance
ratios at low metallicity and the increasing trend of [F/Ba] at
[Fe/H]$\gtrsim$-1 can only be reproduced by chemical evolution models assuming,
at all metallicities, a contribution from rapidly rotating massive stars with
initial rotational velocities as high as 300km s$^{-1}$. A mix of rotational
velocities may provide a more physical solution than the sole use of massive
stars with $v_{\text{rot}}$=300$\text{km s}^{-1}$, which are predicted to
overestimate the fluorine and average s-process elemental abundances at
[Fe/H]$\gtrsim$-1. The contribution from AGB stars is predicted to start at
[Fe/H]$\approx$-1 and becomes increasingly important at high metallicity, being
strictly coupled to the evolution of the nitrogen abundance. Finally, by using

the trapping of impurities inside the BEC. We find out that for the small value

For mild coupling strengths, attractive and repulsive impurities are captured
after a few cycles of oscillation inside the BEC. In the strong interaction

Our conclusion indicates that quench dynamics can be a tool for studying
impurity BEC interactions or impurity-impurity interactions. Our analysis shows
that the generation of phonon, shock waves, soliton trains, and self-trapping

to the integrative analysis since missing variables have traditionally: (1)
been removed from the data for complete case analysis; or (2) been completed by
missing data interpolation techniques using data with the same covariate
distribution from other studies. In most integrative-analysis studies, neither
approach is optimal as it leads to either loosing the majority of study
covariates or challenges in specifying the cohorts following the same
distributions. We propose a novel approach to identify the studies with same
distributions that could be used for completing the cohort-level missing
information. Our methodology relies on (1) identifying sub-groups of cohorts
with similar covariate distributions using cohort identity random forest
prediction models followed by clustering; and then (2) applying a recursive
pairwise distribution test for high dimensional data to these sub-groups.
Extensive simulation studies show that cohorts with the same distribution are
correctly grouped together in almost all simulation settings. Our methods'

unique goal of maximizing clustering performance, that ignores the personalized

However, in real scenarios, oracles may tend to cluster unlabeled data by
exploiting distinct criteria, such as distinct semantics (background, color,
object, etc.), and then put forward personalized clustering tasks. To achieve
task-aware clustering results, in this study, Oracle-guided Contrastive
Clustering(OCC) is then proposed to cluster by interactively making pairwise
``same-cluster"" queries to oracles with distinctive demands. Specifically,
inspired by active learning, some informative instance pairs are queried, and
evaluated by oracles whether the pairs are in the same cluster according to
their desired orientation. And then these queried same-cluster pairs extend the
set of positive instance pairs for contrastive learning, guiding OCC to extract
orientation-aware feature representation. Accordingly, the query results,
guided by oracles with distinctive demands, may drive the OCC's clustering
results in a desired orientation. Theoretically, the clustering risk in an
active learning manner is given with a tighter upper bound, that guarantees
active queries to oracles do mitigate the clustering risk. Experimentally,
extensive results verify that OCC can cluster accurately along the specific
orientation and it substantially outperforms the SOTA clustering methods as
well. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first deep framework to perform
personalized clustering.

concurrence of the system to quantify the thermal entanglement. We suggest a
scheme, where an external tunable coupler qubit sandwich between two
superconducting qubits generates entanglement. The behavior of concurrence is
analyzed for three different cases, in which we consider the effects of the
temperature, the qubit-qubit effective coupling strength, and the qubit
frequencies on the thermal entanglement. What deserves mentioning here is that
to achieve maximally entangled states, it is better to use two superconducting
qubits with the same frequencies. We also note that for a given temperature,
the thermal entanglement can be tuned by qubit internal capacitance and
inductance.

information into the asset selection process. In this contribution we consider
qualitative views specified as total orders of the expected asset returns and
discuss two different approaches for incorporating this input in a
mean-variance portfolio optimization model. In the robust optimization approach
we first compute a posterior expectation of asset returns for every given total
order by an extension of the Black-Litterman (BL) framework. Then these
expected asset returns are considered as possible input scenarios for robust
optimization variants of the mean-variance portfolio model (max-min robustness,
min regret robustness and soft robustness). In the order aggregation approach
rules from social choice theory (Borda, Footrule, Copeland, Best-of-k and MC4)
are used to aggregate the total order in a single ``consensus total order''.
Then expected asset returns are computed for this ``consensus total order'' by
the extended BL framework mentioned above. Finally, these expectations are used
as an input of the classical mean-variance optimization. Using data from
EUROSTOXX 50 and S&P 100 we empirically compare the success of the two
approaches in the context of portfolio performance analysis and observe that in
general aggregating orders by social choice methods outperforms robust
optimization based methods for both data sets.

mass $M_{\star}\geq 3 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ and follow their evolution since
first entering their host cluster. Very few stellar discs survive since falling
in such dense environments, ranging from 40% surviving to all being disrupted.
Such survival rates are consistent with what reported earlier for the two more
massive, Virgo-like clusters in TNG50. In absolute terms, however, the low
number of present-day disc galaxies in Fornax-like clusters could be at odds
with the presence of three edge-on disc galaxies in the central regions of the
actual Fornax cluster, as delineated by the Fornax3D survey. When looking at
the Fornax analogues from random directions and with the same selection
function of Fornax3D, the probability of finding three edge-on disc galaxies in
any one Fornax-like cluster in TNG50 is rather low, albeit not impossible. We
also compared the stellar-population properties near the equatorial plane
derived from integral-field spectroscopy for the three edge-ons in Fornax to
similar line-of-sight integrated values for present-day disc galaxies in TNG50.
For one of these, the very old and metal-rich stellar population of its disc
cannot be matched by any the disc galaxies in TNG50, including objects in the
field. We discuss possible interpretations of these findings, while pointing to
future studies on passive cluster spirals as a way to further test

tension of deionized water in a uniform field of 450 mT is insignificant, 0.19
- 0.21 mNm-1. Measurements on droplets of compensated zero-susceptibility
solutions of Cu2+, Mn2+ and Dy3+ where the shape is unaffected by any magnetic
body force show changes of surface tension of about -1% in 500 mT. Magnetic
field gradients of up to 100 T2m-1 deform the droplets and lead to changes of
\r{ho}eff that are negative for diamagnetic solutions (buoyancy effect) and
positive for paramagnetic solutions. The droplet profile of
strongly-paramagnetic 0.1 Dy M DyCl3 solution is analysed, treating the
nonuniform vertical field gradient as a spatial variation of gravity. The
influence of Maxwell stress on droplet shape is discussed. In dynamic
measurements, the droplet shape at pinch-off is recorded by high-speed
photography and analysed in terms of a relative change of dynamic surface
tension in the presence of a magnetic field. The surface-tension-dependent
pre-factor of the scaling law that governs the pinch-off dynamics shows no
difference for pure water or 0.11 M DyCl3 solutions in the field. The
nonuniform field has no influence in the pinch-off region because the filament

most previous works address Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a closed-set
classification problem, this limits their transferability to unseen terms. The
ability to define custom keywords has advantages in terms of user experience.
  In this paper, we propose a metric learning-based training strategy for
user-defined keyword spotting. In particular, we make the following
contributions: (1) we construct a large-scale keyword dataset with an existing
speech corpus and propose a filtering method to remove data that degrade model
training; (2) we propose a metric learning-based two-stage training strategy,
and demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance on the
user-defined keyword spotting task by enriching their representations; (3) to
facilitate the fair comparison in the user-defined KWS field, we propose
unified evaluation protocol and metrics.
  Our proposed system does not require an incremental training on the
user-defined keywords, and outperforms previous works by a significant margin
on the Google Speech Commands dataset using the proposed as well as the
existing metrics.

immensely costly and requires novel methods to scan traffic for malicious

huge landscape of attack types makes deep learning methods an attractive option
for their ability to capture highly-nonlinear behavior patterns. In this paper,
the authors demonstrate an improvement upon a previously introduced
methodology, which used a dual-autoencoder approach to identify ZDTs in network
flow telemetry. In addition to the previously-introduced asset-level graph
features, which help abstractly represent the role of a host in its network,
this new model uses metric learning to train the second autoencoder on labeled
attack data. This not only produces stronger performance, but it has the added
advantage of improving the interpretability of the model by allowing for
multiclass classification in the latent space. This can potentially save human
threat hunters time when they investigate predicted ZDTs by showing them which
known attack classes were nearby in the latent space. The models presented here
are also trained and evaluated with two more datasets, and continue to show
promising results even when generalizing to new network topologies.

trajectory of a particle. The static solution arises in the presence of no

prove the stability of the static solution for particles with positive bare

the cost of training ML models. It does so by using very small amounts of
(expensive, well-inspected) labeled data and large amounts of (cheap,
non-inspected) unlabeled data. SSL has shown comparable or even superior
performances compared to conventional fully-supervised ML techniques.
  In this paper, we show that the key feature of SSL that it can learn from
(non-inspected) unlabeled data exposes SSL to strong poisoning attacks. In
fact, we argue that, due to its reliance on non-inspected unlabeled data,
poisoning is a much more severe problem in SSL than in conventional
fully-supervised ML.
  Specifically, we design a backdoor poisoning attack on SSL that can be
conducted by a weak adversary with no knowledge of target SSL pipeline. This is
unlike prior poisoning attacks in fully-supervised settings that assume strong
adversaries with practically-unrealistic capabilities. We show that by
poisoning only 0.2% of the unlabeled training data, our attack can cause
misclassification of more than 80% of test inputs (when they contain the
adversary's backdoor trigger). Our attacks remain effective across twenty
combinations of benchmark datasets and SSL algorithms, and even circumvent the
state-of-the-art defenses against backdoor attacks. Our work raises significant
concerns about the practical utility of existing SSL algorithms.

regime in superconducting hybrid nanostructures with ferromagnetic interlayers.
Strong confinement of electromagnetic field between superconducting plates is
found to result in the existence of magnon-polariton modes with ultrastrong
magnon-photon coupling, ultra-high cooperativity and very large group
velocities. These modes provide a numerically accurate explanation of recent
experiments and have intriguing quantum properties. The magnon-polariton
quantum vacuum consists of the squeezed magnon and photon states with the
degree of squeezing controlled in wide limits by the external magnetic field.
The ground state population of virtual photons and magnons is shown to be very
large which can be used for generating correlated magnon and photon pairs.
Excited states of magnon-polaritons contain bipartite entanglement between
magnons and photons. This property can be used for transferring entanglement
between different types of quantum systems.

propose an efficient approach for solving a class of control problems for

scheme to build a low-dimensional reduced-order model of the subsystem's
non-Markovian dynamics. Simulating dynamics of such a reduced-order model,
viewed as a ``digital twin"" of the original subsystem, is significantly more
efficient, which enables the use of gradient-based optimization toolbox in the
control parameter space. We validate the proposed method by solving control
problems for quantum spin chains. In particular, the approach automatically
identifies sequences for exciting the quasiparticles and guiding their dynamics
to recover and transmit information. Additionally, when disorder is induced and
the system is in the many body localized phase, we find generalized spin-echo
sequences for dynamics inversion, which show improved performance compared to
standard ones. Our approach by design takes advantage of non-Markovian dynamics
of a subsystem to make control protocols more efficient, and, under certain
conditions can store information in the rest of the many-body system and
subsequently retrieve it at a desired moment of time. We expect that our
results will find direct applications in the study of many-body systems, in
probing non-trivial quasiparticle properties, as well as in development control

robustness analysis of four popular image recognition models (MobileNetV2,

the impact of the following parameters in the model's computational
environment: (1) deep learning frameworks; (2) compiler optimizations; and (3)

worlds, where some circumstances are different from what (f)actually occurred
(counter-to-fact) -- is ubiquitous in human cognition. Conventionally,
counterfactually-altered circumstances have been treated as ""small miracles""
that locally violate the laws of nature while sharing the same initial
conditions. In Pearl's structural causal model (SCM) framework this is made
mathematically rigorous via interventions that modify the causal laws while the
values of exogenous variables are shared. In recent years, however, this purely
interventionist account of counterfactuals has increasingly come under scrutiny
from both philosophers and psychologists. Instead, they suggest a backtracking
account of counterfactuals, according to which the causal laws remain unchanged
in the counterfactual world; differences to the factual world are instead
""backtracked"" to altered initial conditions (exogenous variables). In the
present work, we explore and formalise this alternative mode of counterfactual
reasoning within the SCM framework. Despite ample evidence that humans
backtrack, the present work constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the
first general account and algorithmisation of backtracking counterfactuals. We
discuss our backtracking semantics in the context of related literature and
draw connections to recent developments in explainable artificial intelligence

the probability that the walk moves from a point of $\mathbb{Z}$ to a given
neighbor depends on the number of previous crossings of the directed edge from
the initial point to the target, called the local time of the edge. They found
this model had a very peculiar behavior. Indeed, for the non-Markovian random
walks most closely related to it, which are defined with undirected edges
replacing directed edges, T\'oth proved in his works of 1994, 1995 and 1996
that the process formed by the local times of all the edges, evaluated at a
stopping time of a certain type and suitably renormalized, converges to a
random process. The behavior of the self-repelling random walk with directed

the limit process is deterministic. In this work, we study the fluctuations of
the local times process around this deterministic limit, about which nothing

$M_1$ topology, as well as in the uniform topology away from the
discontinuities of the limit, but not in the most classical Skorohod topology.
We also prove the convergence of the fluctuations of the aforementioned

from scalability issues when making inferences on unseen nodes, as the feature

applications. Phase-based ranging has recently gained momentum due to its high
accuracy in multipath environment compared to traditional schemes such as
ranging based on received signal strength. The phase-based ranging requires
tone exchange on multiple frequencies on a uniformly sampled frequency grid.
Such tone exchange may not be possible due to some missing tones, e.g.,
reserved advertisement channels. Furthermore, the IQ values at a given tone may
be distorted by interference. In this paper, we proposed two phase-based
ranging schemes which deal with the missing/interfered tones. We compare the
performance and complexity of the proposed schemes using simulations,
complexity analysis, and measurement setups. In particular, we show that for
small number of missing/interfered tones, the proposed system based on
employing a trained neural network (NN) performs very close to a reference
ranging system where there is no missing/interference tones. Interestingly,
this high performance is at the cost of negligible additional computational
complexity and up to 60.5 Kbytes of additional required memory compared to the
reference system, making it an attractive solution for ranging using
hardware-limited radios such as BLE.

in real-time, while the observer loop runs on a slower time scale. To achieve
this, we introduce a novel parameter estimation method known as attention-based
noise-robust averaging, in which surface thermography time series are used to
directly estimate the tissue's diffusivity. Our observer contains a real-time
parameter adaptation component based on this diffusivity adaptation law, as
well as a Luenberger-type corrector based on the sensed surface temperature. In
this work, we also present a novel model structure adapted to the setting of
robotic surgery, wherein we model the electrosurgical heat distribution as a
compactly supported magnitude- and velocity-controlled heat source involving a
new nonlinear input mapping. We demonstrate satisfactory performance of the
adaptive observer in simulation, using real-life experimental ex vivo porcine
tissue data.

alternative to explicit 3D object encodings, such as polygonal meshes,

appearance. Traditional explicit object representations commonly couple the 3D
shape data with auxiliary surface-mapped image data, such as diffuse color
textures and fine-scale geometric details in normal maps that typically require
a mapping of the 3D surface onto a plane, i.e., a surface parameterization;
implicit representations, on the other hand, cannot be easily textured due to
lack of configurable surface parameterization. Inspired by this digital content
authoring methodology, we design a neural network architecture that implicitly
encodes the underlying surface parameterization suitable for appearance data.
As such, our model remains compatible with existing mesh-based digital content

paper aims to design a novel axiomatic approach to risk measures in random

appropriately evaluate the risk of financial positions in the presence of

axiomatically characterize it by proposing a novel set of axioms. Furthermore,
its coherence and dual representation are investigated. The new class of risk
measures in random environments is rich enough, for example, it not only can
recover some known risk measures such as the common weighted value at risk and
range value at risk, but also can induce other new specific risk measures such
as risk measures in the presence of background risk. Examples are given to
illustrate the new framework of risk measures. This paper gives some

alleviate this issue by first capturing rich speech attributes into a

which the cross-modal information, i.e. text and video, is first assembled as a
dynamic graph according to their correlation, and then the graph is processed
by a multi-modal graph encoder to generate the multi-modal embeddings for
further usage in the subsequent neural translation models. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to introduce graph neural networks, for fusing
multi-modal information, into neural sign language translation models.

in machine learning. It saves remarkable communication overhead in large-scale

optimization with time-varying communication patterns alternating between
global averaging and local updates.
  While numerous studies exist to clarify its theoretical limits and develop
efficient algorithms, it remains unclear what the optimal complexity is for
non-convex decentralized stochastic optimization over time-varying networks.
The main difficulties lie in how to gauge the effectiveness when transmitting
messages between two nodes via time-varying communications, and how to
establish the lower bound when the network size is fixed (which is a
prerequisite in stochastic optimization). This paper resolves these challenges
and establish the first lower bound complexity. We also develop a new

source problem in the stationary radiative transport, where the source is
linearly anisotropic. The medium has an anisotropic scattering property that is
neither negligible nor large enough for the diffusion approximation to hold.
The attenuating and scattering properties of the medium are assumed known. For
scattering kernels of finite Fourier content in the angular variable, we show
how to recover the anisotropic radiative sources from boundary measurements.
The approach is based on the Cauchy problem for a Beltrami-like equation
associated with $A$-analytic maps. As an application, we determine necessary
and sufficient conditions for the data coming from two different sources to be
mistaken for each other.

that the anomalous Hall effect is dominated by the intrinsic and

then recognize the action taking place within it. However, cross-contamination,
occlusion, and the articulated nature of the human body, make this approach
challenging in a crowded scene. Here, we leverage articulated body poses for
subject localization and in the subsequent speech detection stage. We show that
the selection of local features around pose keypoints has a positive effect on
generalization performance while also significantly reducing the number of
local features considered, making for a more efficient method. Using two
in-the-wild datasets with different viewpoints of subjects, we investigate the
role of cross-contamination in this effect. We additionally make use of

synthetic 4D aortic velocity profiles suitable to be used as BCs for CFD
simulations. 4D flow MRI scans of 30 subjects with ATAA were processed to
extract cross-sectional planes along the ascending aorta, ensuring spatial
alignment among all planes and interpolating all velocity fields to a reference
configuration. Velocity profiles of the clinical cohort were extensively
characterized by computing flow morphology descriptors of both spatial and
temporal features. By exploiting principal component analysis (PCA), a
statistical shape model (SSM) of 4D aortic velocity profiles was built and a
dataset of 437 synthetic cases with realistic properties was generated.
Comparison between clinical and synthetic datasets showed that the synthetic
data presented similar characteristics as the clinical population in terms of
key morphological parameters. The average velocity profile qualitatively
resembled a parabolic-shaped profile, but was quantitatively characterized by
more complex flow patterns which an idealized profile would not replicate.
Statistically significant correlations were found between PCA principal modes

(ATSC) utilize real-time vehicle trajectory data received from vehicles through
wireless connectivity (i.e., connected vehicles) to regulate green time.
However, this wirelessly connected ATSC increases cyber-attack surfaces and
increases their vulnerability to various cyber-attack modes, which can be
leveraged to induce significant congestion in a roadway network. An attacker
may receive financial benefits to create such a congestion for a specific
roadway. One such mode is a 'sybil' attack in which an attacker creates fake
vehicles in the network by generating fake Basic Safety Messages (BSMs)
imitating actual connected vehicles following roadway traffic rules. The
ultimate goal of an attacker will be to block a route(s) by generating fake or
'sybil' vehicles at a rate such that the signal timing and phasing changes
occur without flagging any abrupt change in number of vehicles. Because of the
highly non-linear and unpredictable nature of vehicle arrival rates and the
ATSC algorithm, it is difficult to find an optimal rate of sybil vehicles,
which will be injected from different approaches of an intersection. Thus, it
is necessary to develop an intelligent cyber-attack model to prove the
existence of such attacks. In this study, a reinforcement learning based
cyber-attack model is developed for a waiting time-based ATSC. Specifically, an
RL agent is trained to learn an optimal rate of sybil vehicle injection to
create congestion for an approach(s). Our analyses revealed that the RL agent
can learn an optimal policy for creating an intelligent attack.

evidence, and keeping only hypotheses which have not yet been falsified. Under
deductive reasoning they are conceived in view of a theory and confronted with
empirical evidence in an attempt to falsify it, and under inductive reasoning
they are conceived based on observation, confronted with empirical evidence and
a theory is established based on the not falsified hypotheses. When the
hypotheses testing can be performed with quantitative data, the confrontation
can be achieved with Machine Learning methods, whose quality is highly
dependent on the hypotheses' complexity, hence on the proper insertion of prior
information into the set of hypotheses seeking to decrease its complexity
without loosing good hypotheses. However, Machine Learning tools have been
applied under the pragmatic view of instrumentalism, which is concerned only
with the performance of the methods and not with the understanding of their
behavior, leading to methods which are not fully understood. In this context,
we discuss how prior information and computational power can be employed to
solve a learning problem, but while prior information and a careful design of
the hypotheses space has as advantage the interpretability of the results,
employing high computational power has the advantage of a higher performance.
We discuss why learning methods which combine both should work better from an
understanding and performance perspective, arguing in favor of basic
theoretical research on Machine Learning, in special about how properties of
classifiers may be identified in parameters of modern learning models.

limitations of empirical indicators - such as abnormal artery Doppler findings

differentiators between FGR and normal controls (decreased perfusion, abnormal

with the preferential shunting of the fetal blood towards the fetal brain.
These features were further explored to determine their role in assessing FGR
severity, by employing simple machine learning models to predict FGR diagnosis

parameter. We estimate the bulk viscosity coefficients and the model parameter
values using the combined H(z)+Pantheon+BAO data set. We study the asymptotic
behavior of our cosmological bulk viscous model by utilizing the phase space
method. We find that corresponding to all three cases, our model depicts the
evolution of the universe from matter dominated decelerated epoch (a past
attractor) to a stable de-sitter accelerated epoch (a future attractor).
Further, we study the physical behavior of effective pressure, effective
equation of state (EoS), and the statefinder parameters. We find that the
pressure component in the presence of bulk viscosity shows negative behavior
and the effective EoS parameter predicts the accelerated expansion phase of the
universe for all three cases. Moreover, we obtain that the trajectories of our
model lie in the quintessence region and it converges to the $\Lambda$CDM fixed
point in the far future. We find that the accelerated deSitter like phase comes
purely from the $\bar{\zeta}_0$ case without any geometrical modification to
GR. Moreover, we find that the late-time behavior of all three cases of
viscosity coefficients are identical.

inheritance of quantitative traits. In this model, a quantitative trait is
expressed as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic (environmental) component
and the genetic component of offspring traits within a family follows a normal
distribution around the average of the parents' trait values, and has a
variance that is independent of the trait values of the parents. In previous
work, Barton et al.(2017), we showed that when trait values are determined by
the sum of a large number of Mendelian factors, each of small effect, one can
justify the infinitesimal model as limit of Mendelian inheritance.
  In this paper, we show that the robustness of the infinitesimal model extends
to include dominance. We define the model in terms of classical quantities of
quantitative genetics, before justifying it as a limit of Mendelian inheritance
as the number, M, of underlying loci tends to infinity. As in the additive
case, the multivariate normal distribution of trait values across the pedigree
can be expressed in terms of variance components in an ancestral population and
probabilities of identity by descent determined by the pedigree. In this
setting, it is natural to decompose trait values, not just into the additive
and dominance components, but into a component that is shared by all
individuals within the family and an independent `residual' for each offspring,
which captures the randomness of Mendelian inheritance. We show that, even if
we condition on parental trait values, both the shared component and the
residuals within each family will be asymptotically normally distributed as the
number of loci tends to infinity, with an error of order 1/\sqrt{M}.
  We illustrate our results with some numerical examples.

technique where an object is formed by photopolymerizing resin via tomographic
projections. Currently, these projections are calculated using the Radon
transform from computed tomography but it ignores two fundamental properties of
real optical projection systems: finite etendue and non-telecentricity. In this
work, we introduce 3D ray tracing as a new method of computing projections in
tomographic VAM and demonstrate high fidelity printing in non-telecentric and
higher etendue systems, leading to a 3X increase in vertical build volume than
the standard Radon method. The method introduced here expands the possible
tomographic VAM printing configurations, enabling faster, cheaper, and higher
fidelity printing.

manipulation. While many efforts focus on generating collision-free reference

However, in human's daily manipulation, contact between arms and obstacles is
prevalent and even necessary. This paper investigates the benefit of allowing
safe contact during robotic manipulation and advocates generating and tracking
compliance reference signals in both operational and null spaces. In addition,
to optimize the collision-allowed trajectories, we present a hybrid solver that
integrates sampling- and gradient-based approaches. We evaluate the proposed
method on a goal-reaching task in five simulated and real-world environments
with different collisional conditions. We show that allowing safe contact
improves goal-reaching efficiency and provides feasible solutions in highly
collisional scenarios where collision-free constraints cannot be enforced.
Moreover, we demonstrate that planning in null space, in addition to
operational space, improves trajectory safety.

employs a multi-gating mechanism to generate unique weighted feature

language and vision. However their huge size and the opaque relations between
their layers and tasks result in slow inference and network overthinking, where
predictions made from the last layer of large models is worse than those made
from intermediate layers. Early exit (EE) strategies can solve both issues by
dynamically reducing computations at inference time for certain samples.
Although popular for classification tasks in vision and language, EE has seen
less use for sequence-to-sequence speech recognition (ASR) tasks where outputs
from early layers are often degenerate. This challenge is further compounded
when speech SSL models are applied on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This
paper first shows that SSL models do overthinking in ASR. We then motivate
further research in EE by computing an optimal bound for performance versus
speed trade-offs. To approach this bound we propose two new strategies for ASR:
(1) we adapt the recently proposed patience strategy to ASR; and (2) we design
a new EE strategy specific to ASR that performs better than all strategies
previously introduced.

before sending it downstream. In this work, we present two designs for SLU
hypothesis rejection modules: (i) scheme R1 that performs rejection on domain
specific SLU hypothesis and, (ii) scheme R2 that performs rejection on
hypothesis generated from the overall SLU system. Hypothesis rejection modules
in both schemes reject/accept a hypothesis based on features drawn from the
utterance directed to the SLU system, the associated SLU hypothesis and SLU
confidence score. Our experiments suggest that both the schemes yield similar
results (scheme R1: 2.5% FRR @ 4.5% FAR, scheme R2: 2.5% FRR @ 4.6% FAR), with
the best performing systems using all the available features. We argue that
while either of the rejection schemes can be chosen over the other, they carry
some inherent differences which need to be considered while making this choice.
Additionally, we incorporate ASR features in the rejection module (obtaining an
1.9% FRR @ 3.8% FAR) and analyze the improvements.

devices in X-ray imaging - a technique that medical, material science and

applications, especially in terms of relaxing X-ray source coherence
requirements. This is because typical grating-based X-ray phase imaging
techniques (e.g., Talbot self-imaging) require a coherence length of at least
one grating period and ideally longer. In this paper, the fabrication
challenges in achieving high aspect-ratio nanogratings filled with gold are
addressed by a combination of laser interference and nanoimprint lithography,
physical vapor deposition, metal assisted chemical etching (MACE), and
electroplating. This relatively simple and cost-efficient approach is unlocked
by an innovative post-MACE drying step with hexamethyldisilazane, which
effectively minimizes the stiction of the nanostructures. The theoretical
limits of the approach are discussed and, experimentally, X-ray nanogratings
with aspect ratios >40 demonstrated. Finally, their excellent diffractive
abilities are shown when exposed to a hard (12.2 keV) monochromatic x-ray beam
at a synchrotron facility, and thus potential applicability in phase-based
X-ray imaging.
