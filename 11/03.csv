to calibrate the propensity scores. We find that post-calibration reduces the
error in effect estimation for expressive uncalibrated statistical estimators,
and that this improvement is not mediated by better balancing. The larger the
initial lack of calibration, the larger the improvement in effect estimation,
with the effect on already-calibrated estimators being very small. Given the

framework. Stack graphs power Precise Code Navigation at GitHub, allowing users
to navigate name binding references both within and across repositories. Like
scope graphs, stack graphs encode the name binding information about a program
in a graph structure, in which paths represent valid name bindings. Resolving a
reference to its definition is then implemented with a simple path-finding
search.
  GitHub hosts millions of repositories, containing petabytes of total code,
implemented in hundreds of different programming languages, and receiving
thousands of pushes per minute. To support this scale, we ensure that the graph
construction and path-finding judgments are file-incremental: for each source
file, we create an isolated subgraph without any knowledge of, or visibility
into, any other file in the program. This lets us eliminate the storage and
compute costs of reanalyzing file versions that we have already seen. Since
most commits change a small fraction of the files in a repository, this greatly
amortizes the operational costs of indexing large, frequently changed
repositories over time. To handle type-directed name lookups (which require
""pausing"" the current lookup to resolve another name), our name resolution
algorithm maintains a stack of the currently paused (but still pending)
lookups. Stack graphs can be constructed via a purely syntactic analysis of the
program's source code, using a new declarative graph construction language.
This means that we can extract name binding information for every repository
without any per-package configuration, and without having to invoke an
arbitrary, untrusted, package-specific build process.

predictive bounds (LPBs) for survival times with censored data. Traditional
methods for survival analysis often assume a parametric model for the
distribution of survival time as a function of the measured covariates, or
assume that this conditional distribution is captured well with a
non-parametric method such as random forests; however, these methods may lead
to undercoverage if their assumptions are not satisfied. In this paper, we
build on recent work by Cand\`es et al. (2021), which offers a more
assumption-lean approach to the problem. Their approach first subsets the data
to discard any data points with early censoring times and then uses a
reweighting technique (namely, weighted conformal inference (Tibshirani et al.,
2019)) to correct for the distribution shift introduced by this subsetting
procedure. For our new method, instead of constraining to a fixed threshold for
the censoring time when subsetting the data, we allow for a covariate-dependent
and data-adaptive subsetting step, which is better able to capture the
heterogeneity of the censoring mechanism. As a result, our method can lead to
LPBs that are less conservative and give more accurate information. We show
that in the Type I right-censoring setting, if either of the censoring
mechanism or the conditional quantile of survival time is well estimated, our
proposed procedure achieves approximately exact marginal coverage, where in the
latter case we additionally have approximate conditional coverage. We evaluate
the validity and efficiency of our proposed algorithm in numerical experiments,
illustrating its advantage when compared with other competing methods. Finally,
our method is applied to a real dataset to generate LPBs for users' active
times on a mobile app.

found in almost all regions especially the Arctic where the temperature anomaly
trend (0.55 K decade-1) was three times more than the global average trend
(around 0.15 K decade-1). In addition, this warming over land was obviously
larger than ocean's warming. The TPW trend was positively correlated with
surface warming over oceans while this correlation over land was negative. The
TPW change in response to temperature T2m or Ts changes showed larger
variations of 5-11% K-1 over oceans than over land (below 4 % K-1 and even

models, where the transition probabilities belong to intervals. Recently, there
has been a surge of research on employing IMDPs as abstractions of stochastic
systems for control synthesis. However, due to the absence of algorithms for
synthesis over IMDPs with continuous action-spaces, the action-space is assumed
discrete a-priori, which is a restrictive assumption for many applications.
Motivated by this, we introduce continuous-action IMDPs (caIMDPs), where the
bounds on transition probabilities are functions of the action variables, and
study value iteration for maximizing expected cumulative rewards. Specifically,
we decompose the max-min problem associated to value iteration to
$|\mathcal{Q}|$ max problems, where $|\mathcal{Q}|$ is the number of states of
the caIMDP. Then, exploiting the simple form of these max problems, we identify
cases where value iteration over caIMDPs can be solved efficiently (e.g., with
linear or convex programming). We also gain other interesting insights: e.g.,
in certain cases where the action set $\mathcal{A}$ is a polytope, synthesis
over a discrete-action IMDP, where the actions are the vertices of
$\mathcal{A}$, is sufficient for optimality. We demonstrate our results on a
numerical example. Finally, we include a short discussion on employing caIMDPs

unstructured data. The structure of data is encoded in the metric relationships
between data points. In the context of neural networks, neuronal activity
within a layer forms a representation reflecting the transformation that the
layer implements on its inputs. In order to utilize the structure in the data
in a truthful manner, such representations should reflect the input distances
and thus be continuous and isometric. Supporting this statement, recent
findings in neuroscience propose that generalization and robustness are tied to
neural representations being continuously differentiable. In machine learning,
most algorithms lack robustness and are generally thought to rely on aspects of
the data that differ from those that humans use, as is commonly seen in
adversarial attacks. During cross-entropy classification, the metric and
structural properties of network representations are usually broken both
between and within classes. This side effect from training can lead to
instabilities under perturbations near locations where such structure is not
preserved. One of the standard solutions to obtain robustness is to add ad hoc
regularization terms, but to our knowledge, forcing representations to preserve
the metric structure of the input data as a stabilising mechanism has not yet
been studied. In this work, we train neural networks to perform classification
while simultaneously maintaining within-class metric structure, leading to
isometric within-class representations. Such network representations turn out
to be beneficial for accurate and robust inference. By stacking layers with
this property we create a network architecture that facilitates hierarchical
manipulation of internal neural representations. Finally, we verify that
isometric regularization improves the robustness to adversarial attacks on
MNIST.

clumping in the intracluster medium of massive galaxy clusters and how it
affects the hydrostatic mass bias. By comparing the clumping to the azimuthal
scatter in the emission measure, an observational proxy, we find that they both
increase with radius and are larger in higher-mass and dynamically perturbed
systems. Similar trends are also seen for the azimuthal temperature scatter and
non-thermal pressure fraction, both of which correlate with density
fluctuations, with these values also increasing with redshift. However, in
agreement with recent work, we find only a weak correlation between the
clumping, or its proxies, and the hydrostatic mass bias. To reduce the effect
of clumping in the projected profiles, we compute the azimuthal median
following recent observational studies, and find this reduces the scatter in
the bias. We also attempt to correct the cluster masses by using a non-thermal
pressure term and find over-corrected mass estimates ($1-b=0.86$ to $1-b=1.15$)
from 3D gas profiles but improved mass estimates ($1-b=0.75$ to $1-b=0.85$)
from projected gas profiles, with the caveat of systematically increased
scatter. We conclude that the cluster-averaged mass bias is minimised from
applying a non-thermal pressure correction ($1-b=0.85$) with more modest
reductions from selecting clusters that have low clumping ($1-b=0.79$) or are
dynamically relaxed ($1-b=0.80$). However, the latter selection is most
effective at minimising the scatter for individual objects. Such results can be
tested with next generation X-ray missions equipped with high-resolution
spectrometers such as Athena.

Mean-Variance Criterion (MVC) is equivalent to the Maximum Expected Utility
Criterion (MEUC), for two lotteries. Based on Chamberlain (1983), we conclude
that the MVC is equivalent to the Second-order Stochastic Dominance Rule (SSDR)
under any symmetric Elliptical distribution. We then discuss the work of
Schuhmacher et al. (2021). Although their theoretical findings deduce that the
Mean-Variance Analysis remains valid under Skew-Elliptical distributions, we
argue that this does not entail that the MVC coincides with the SSDR. In fact,
generating multiple MV-pairs that follow a Skew-Normal distribution it becomes
evident that the MVC fails to coincide with the SSDR for some types of
risk-averse investors. In the second part of this work, we examine the premise
of Levy and Markowitz (1979) that ""the MVC deduces the maximization of the
expected utility of an investor, under any approximately quadratic utility
function, without making any further assumption on the distribution of the
lotteries"". Using Monte Carlo Simulations, we find out that the set of
approximately quadratic utility functions is too narrow. Specifically, our
simulations indicate that $\log{(a+Z)}$ and $(1+Z)^a$ are almost quadratic,
while $-e^{-a(1+Z)}$ and $-(1+Z)^{-a}$ fail to approximate a quadratic utility
function under either an Extreme Value or a Stable Pareto distribution.

supervised learning performance. These methods rely on maximizing the
similarity between embeddings of related synthetic inputs created through data
augmentations. This can be seen as a task that encourages embeddings to leave
out factors modified by these augmentations, i.e. to be invariant to them.
However, this only considers one side of the trade-off in the choice of the
augmentations: they need to strongly modify the images to avoid simple solution
shortcut learning (e.g. using only color histograms), but on the other hand,
augmentations-related information may be lacking in the representations for
some downstream tasks (e.g. color is important for birds and flower
classification). Few recent works proposed to mitigate the problem of using
only an invariance task by exploring some form of equivariance to
augmentations. This has been performed by learning additional embeddings
space(s), where some augmentation(s) cause embeddings to differ, yet in a
non-controlled way. In this work, we introduce EquiMod a generic equivariance
module that structures the learned latent space, in the sense that our module
learns to predict the displacement in the embedding space caused by the
augmentations. We show that applying that module to state-of-the-art invariance

function which is usually a weighted $\ell_{p}$ norm based distance. In this
paper, we propose a delayed constraint generation method with each subproblem
solved by the semismooth Newton based proximal augmented Lagrangian method
(PALM) for the metric nearness problem. Due to the high memory requirement for
the storage of the matrix related to the metric constraints, we take advantage
of the special structure of the matrix and do not need to store the
corresponding constraint matrix. A pleasing aspect of our algorithm is that we
can solve these problems involving up to $10^{8}$ variables and $10^{13}$
constraints. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.
  In theory, firstly, under a mild condition, we establish a primal-dual error
bound condition which is very essential for the analysis of local convergence
rate of PALM. Secondly, we prove the equivalence between the dual nondegeneracy
condition and nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian for the inner
subproblem of PALM. Thirdly, when $q(\cdot)=\|\cdot\|_{1}$ or
$\|\cdot\|_{\infty}$, without the strict complementarity condition, we also
prove the equivalence between the the dual nondegeneracy condition and the

multilevel interactions between elections can all greatly impact the makeup of
these representative bodies. This perspective is not new: the adoption of
federal systems has been motivated by the idea that they possess desirable
traits not provided by democracies on a single scale. Yet most existing models
of polarization do not capture how nested local and national elections interact
with heterogeneous political geographies. We begin by developing a framework to
describe the multilevel distribution of opinions and analyze the flow of
variance among geographic scales, applying it to historical data in the United
States from 1912 to 2020. We describe how unstable elections can arise due to
the spatial distribution of opinions and how tradeoffs occur between national
and local elections. We also examine multi-dimensional spaces of political
opinion, for which we show that a decrease in local salience can constrain the
dimensions along which elections occur, preventing a federal system from
serving as an effective safeguard against polarization. These analyses, based
on the interactions between elections and opinion distributions at various
scales, offer insights into how democracies can be strengthened to mitigate
polarization and increase electoral representation.

Recent experiments in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have uncovered
a wealth of novel phases as a result of interaction-driven spin-valley flavour
polarization. In this work, we explore correlated phases appearing due to the
combined effect of spin-orbit coupling-enhanced valley polarization and large
density of states below half filling ($\nu \lesssim 2$) of the moir\'e band in
a TBG coupled to tungsten diselenide. We observe anomalous Hall effect,
accompanied by a series of Lifshitz transitions, that are highly tunable with
carrier density and magnetic field. Strikingly, the magnetization shows an
abrupt sign change in the vicinity of half-filling, confirming its orbital
nature. The coercive fields reported are about an order of magnitude higher
than previous studies in graphene-based moir\'e systems, presumably aided by a
Stoner instability favoured by the van Hove singularities in the malleable
bands. While the Hall resistance is not quantized at zero magnetic fields,
indicative of a ground state with partial valley polarization, perfect
quantization and complete valley polarization are observed at finite fields.
Our findings illustrate that singularities in the flat bands in the presence of
spin-orbit coupling can stabilize ordered phases even at non-integer moir\'e

learning of features in regard to bias attributes (i.e., bias features) helps
target task optimization, we explore the following research question: \emph{Can
we leverage proxy features to replace the role of bias feature in target task
optimization for debiasing?} To this end, we propose \emph{Proxy Debiasing}, to
first transfer the target task's learning of bias information from bias
features to artificial proxy features, and then employ causal intervention to
eliminate proxy features in inference. The key idea of \emph{Proxy Debiasing}
is to design controllable proxy features to on one hand replace bias features
in contributing to target task during the training stage, and on the other hand
easily to be removed by intervention during the inference stage. This
guarantees the elimination of bias features without affecting the target

contour adaption for segmenting ball-shaped medical objects; (2) Circle
representation has fewer degrees of freedom (DoF=2) as compared with the

multi-device split-inference system. In the considered system, local feature
vectors, which are extracted from the real-time noisy sensory data on devices,
are aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the waveform superposition in a
multiuser channel. Then the aggregated features as received at a server are fed
into an inference model with the result used for decision making or control of
actuators. To design inference-oriented AirComp, the transmit precoders at edge
devices and receive beamforming at edge server are jointly optimized to rein in
the aggregation error and maximize the inference accuracy. The problem is made
tractable by measuring the inference accuracy using a surrogate metric called
discriminant gain, which measures the discernibility of two object classes in
the application of object/event classification. It is discovered that the
conventional AirComp beamforming design for minimizing the mean square error in
generic AirComp with respect to the noiseless case may not lead to the optimal
classification accuracy. The reason is due to the overlooking of the fact that
feature dimensions have different sensitivity towards aggregation errors and
are thus of different importance levels for classification. This issue is
addressed in this work via a new task-oriented AirComp scheme designed by
directly maximizing the derived discriminant gain.

smaller datasets are likely not statistically significant, (ii) there are at
least three baselines that perform well on most datasets and should be
considered in future experiments, and (iii) improved uncertainty quantification
(via nested CV and statistical testing) rules out some reported differences
between linear and neural methods. Given these results, we advocate that future

pairwise alignments between query and document tokens (e.g. `dog' vs. `puppy')
and per-token unary saliences reflecting their relative importance for
retrieval. We show that controlling the sparsity of pairwise token alignments
often brings significant performance gains. While most factoid questions
focusing on a specific part of a document require a smaller number of
alignments, others requiring a broader understanding of a document favor a
larger number of alignments. Unary saliences, on the other hand, decide whether
a token ever needs to be aligned with others for retrieval (e.g. `kind' from
`kind of currency is used in new zealand}'). With sparsified unary saliences,
we are able to prune a large number of query and document token vectors and
improve the efficiency of multi-vector retrieval. We learn the sparse unary
saliences with entropy-regularized linear programming, which outperforms other
methods to achieve sparsity. In a zero-shot setting, AligneR scores 51.1 points
nDCG@10, achieving a new retriever-only state-of-the-art on 13 tasks in the
BEIR benchmark. In addition, adapting pairwise alignments with a few examples
(<= 8) further improves the performance up to 15.7 points nDCG@10 for argument

framework for a scalar field theory and gravity. Symmetry reduction is
implemented via second class constraints for the field modes over a
partitioning of the non-compact spatial slice $\Sigma$ into disjoint cells. The
canonical structure of the resulting homogeneous theories is obtained via the
associated Dirac bracket which can only be defined on a finite number of cells
homogeneously patched together and agrees with the full theory Poisson bracket
for the averaged fields. This identifies a finite region $V_o$, the fiducial
cell, whose size $L$ sets the physical scale over which homogeneity is imposed,
namely a wavelength cutoff. The reduced theory results from 1) selecting a
subset of $V_o$-averaged observables of the full theory; 2) neglecting
inhomogeneous $\vec k\neq\mathbf0$ modes with wavelengths $\lambda\geq L$ and
$\lambda< L$; 3) neglecting boundary terms encoding interactions between
neighbouring cells. The error made is of order $\mathcal O(1/kL)$. As a result,
the off-shell structures of the reduced theory depend on the size of $V_o$ and
different $V_o$ identify canonically inequivalent theories whose dynamics
though is $V_o$-independent. Their quantisation leads then to a family of
$V_o$-labeled quantum representations and the quantum version of an active
rescaling of $V_o$ is implemented via a suitable dynamics-preserving
isomorphism between the different theories. We discuss the consequences for
statistical moments, fluctuations, and semiclassical states in both a standard
and polymer quantisation. For a scalar field of mass $m$, we also sketch the
quantum reduction and identify a subsector of the QFT where the results of
the""first reduced, then quantised"" theories can be reproduced with good
approximation as long as $m\gg1/L$. Finally, a strategy to include
inhomogeneities in cosmology is outlined.

processing techniques. In particular, we focus on the following methods:
adaptive receive processing of range profiles depending on the target
environment; adoption of learning-based methods so that the radar utilizes the
results from prior measurements; application of methods that exploit the fact
that the target scene is sparse in some domain or dictionary; application of
advanced classification techniques; and convolutional coding which provides
succinct and representatives features of the targets. We describe each of these
techniques or their combinations through a representative application of
landmine detection.

In this paper, a three-dimensional model based on a high-resolution

saturation, the hydraulic gradient, and the pressure oil pipeline are
investigated through the temporal evolution of the contaminant migration
following the saturation profiles of the three-phase fluids flow in the
variably saturated zone. The calculation results indicate that the leaking
oil's pressure is the parameter that significantly affects the contaminants'
arrival time to the groundwater table. Also, the water saturation of the
unsaturated zone influences the arrival time as the water saturation increases
for a fixed depth. The unsaturated zone depth significantly influences the
contaminant migration unsaturated zone. At the same time, the oil density and
the hydraulic gradient have limited effects on the contaminant migration in the

singularity at the critical point in the form $M\sim |F-F_c|^{-n}$. The value
of $ {M}$, therefore, changes drastically as the driving field $F$ is tuned
towards its critical value $F_c$. The inequality in the values of $ {M}$ within
a range $aF_c$ to $bF_c$ ($0<a<b\leq 1$) can be quantified by the Gini index
$g$. We show that for $n<1$, the Gini index obeys a scaling of the form
$|F-F_c|\sim |g-g_f|^{1/(1-n)}$, where $g_f=g(b=1)=n/(2-n)$. This implies $
{M}\sim |g-g_f|^{-n/(1-n)}$. For $1<n<2$, $|F-F_c| \sim |g-g_f|^{1/(n-1)}$,
with $g_f=1$ which implies $ {M}\sim |g-g_f|^{-n/(n-1)}$ and similarly for
$n>2$, $|F-F_c| \sim |g-g_f|$, with $g_f=1$, therefore $ {M}\sim |g-g_f|^{-n}$
. Since $g_f$ is either solely a function of the (universal) critical exponent
$n$ or a constant, the above relations help in formulating the critical scaling
behavior in quantities like $ {M}$ independent of the (non-universal) critical
point of the system. We further show for $n>1$, another measure of inequality
-- the Kolkata index $k$, coincides with the Gini index value at a point
$F_e<F_c$. The coincidence of the two indices, therefore, serve as a crucial
indicator of the imminent critical point. We demonstrate the utility of this
precursory signal in the fiber bundle model for fracture of disordered solids.

critical behavior.

consistent enhancement of the structure factor $ S(k)$ at $k \to 0,$ upon

computation that utilizes the full capacity of the architecture or do they
learn a simpler, tree-like computation, hypothesized to underlie compositional
meaning systems like human languages? There is an apparent tension between
compositional accounts of human language understanding, which are based on a
restricted bottom-up computational process, and the enormous success of neural
models like transformers, which can route information arbitrarily between
different parts of their input. One possibility is that these models, while
extremely flexible in principle, in practice learn to interpret language
hierarchically, ultimately building sentence representations close to those
predictable by a bottom-up, tree-structured model. To evaluate this
possibility, we describe an unsupervised and parameter-free method to
\emph{functionally project} the behavior of any transformer into the space of
tree-structured networks. Given an input sentence, we produce a binary tree
that approximates the transformer's representation-building process and a score
that captures how ""tree-like"" the transformer's behavior is on the input. While
calculation of this score does not require training any additional models, it
provably upper-bounds the fit between a transformer and any tree-structured
approximation. Using this method, we show that transformers for three different
tasks become more tree-like over the course of training, in some cases
unsupervisedly recovering the same trees as supervised parsers. These trees, in
turn, are predictive of model behavior, with more tree-like models generalizing
better on tests of compositional generalization.

  Verification using Linear Programming","17 pages, 6 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing large-scale control systems to satisfy complex specifications is
hard in practice, as most formal methods are limited to systems of modest size.
Contract theory has been proposed as a modular alternative to formal methods in
control, in which specifications are defined by assumptions on the input to a
component and guarantees on its output. However, current contract-based methods
for control systems either prescribe guarantees on the state of the system,
going against the spirit of contract theory, or can only support rudimentary
compositions.
  In this paper, we present a contract-based modular framework for
discrete-time dynamical control systems. We extend the definition of contracts
by allowing the assumption on the input at a time $k$ to depend on outputs up
to time $k-1$, which is essential when considering the feedback connection of
an unregulated dynamical system and a controller. We also define contract
composition for arbitrary interconnection topologies, under the pretence of
well-posedness, and prove that this notion supports modular design, analysis
and verification. This is done using graph theory methods, and specifically
using the notions of topological ordering and backward-reachable nodes. Lastly,
we use $k$-induction to present an algorithm for verifying vertical contracts,
which are claims of the form ""the conjugation of given component-level
contracts is a stronger specification than a given contract on the integrated
system"". These algorithms are based on linear programming, and scale linearly
with the number of components in the interconnected network. A numerical
example is provided to demonstrate the scalability of the presented approach,
as well as the modularity achieved by using it.

increase the network capacity in decoding more speaker attractors, and to
jointly train the attractors on a speaker recognition task to improve the

a tool to reduce the computational cost and memory requirements of nuclear
many-body methods. JLEs are randomized projections of high-dimensional data
tensors onto low-dimensional subspaces that preserve key structural features.
Such embeddings allow for the oblivious and incremental compression of large
tensors, e.g., the nuclear Hamiltonian, into significantly smaller random
sketches that still allow for the accurate calculation of ground-state energies
and other observables. Their oblivious character makes it possible to compress
a tensor without knowing in advance exactly what observables one might want to
approximate at a later time. This opens the door for the use of tensors that
are much too large to store in memory, e.g., complete two-plus three-nucleon
Hamiltonians in large, symmetry-unrestricted bases. Such compressed
Hamiltonians can be stored and used later on with relative ease.
  As a first step, we analyze the JLE's impact on the second-order Many-Body
Perturbation Theory (MBPT) corrections for nuclear ground-state observables.
Numerical experiments for a wide range of closed-shell nuclei, model spaces and
state-of-the-art nuclear interactions demonstrate the validity and potential of
the proposed approach: We can compress nuclear Hamiltonians hundred- to
thousand-fold while only incurring mean relative errors of 1\% or less in
ground-state observables. Importantly, we show that JLEs capture the relevant
physical information contained in the highly structured Hamiltonian tensor
despite their random characteristics. In addition to the significant storage
savings, the achieved compressions imply multiple order-of magnitude reductions
in computational effort when the compressed Hamiltonians are used in
higher-order MBPT or nonperturbative many-body methods.

features with independent support prototypes and segment the query image by

knowledge to generate class-agnostic prior mask which makes a distinction
between real background and foreground by highlighting all object regions,
especially those of unseen classes. By jointly aggregating class-aware and
class-agnostic alignment guidance, better segmentation performances are
obtained on query images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$

most fascinating aspects is that a developing embryo can reliably recover from
disturbances, such as splitting into twins. While this reliability implies some
type of goal-seeking error minimization over a morphogenic field, there are
many gaps with respect to detailed, constructive models of such a process being
used to implement the collective intelligence of cellular swarms. We describe a
closed-loop negative-feedback system for creating reaction-diffusion (RD)
patterns with high reliability. It uses a cellular automaton to characterize a
morphogen pattern, then compares it to a goal and adjusts accordingly,
providing a framework for modeling anatomical homeostasis and robust generation
of target morphologies. Specifically, we create a RD pattern with N
repetitions, where N is easily changeable. Furthermore, the individual
repetitions of the RD pattern can be easily stretched or shrunk under genetic
control to create, e.g., some morphological features larger than others.
Finally, the cellular automaton uses a computation wave that scans the
morphogen pattern unidirectionally to characterize the features that the
negative feedback then controls. By taking advantage of a prior process
asymmetrically establishing planar polarity (e.g., head vs. tail), our
automaton is greatly simplified. This work contributes to the exciting effort
of understanding design principles of morphological computation, which can be
used to understand evolved developmental mechanisms, manipulate them in
regenerative medicine settings, or embed a degree of synthetic intelligence
into novel bioengineered constructs.

Field Theory (SMEFT). In the first part of the paper, we use the 'amplitude
analysis' i.e. dispersion relation for $2\rightarrow2$ scattering in the
forward limit, to put bounds on the Wilson coefficients. We show that the
dimension 6 operators can exist only in the presence of certain dimension 8
operators. It is interesting that the square of the dimension 6 Wilson
coefficients can be constrained in this case even at the tree level. In the
second part of this work, we successfully rederive all these bounds using the
classical causality argument that demands that the speed of fluctuations about
any non-trivial background should not exceed the speed of light. We also point
out some subtleties in the superluminality analysis regarding whether the
low-frequency phase velocity can always be used as the relevant quantity for
Causality violation: as an example, we show that, due to these subtleties, if a
small pion mass is added in the chiral Lagrangian, it is unclear if any strict
positivity bound can be derived on the dimension 8 Wilson coefficient. Finally,
we mention an interesting non-relativistic example where the subluminality
requirement produces a stronger bound than the 'amplitude analysis'.

text-conditioned high-resolution image synthesis. Starting from random noise,
such text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative
fashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis
behavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling,
generation strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content,
while later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests
that sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not
be ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an
ensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis
stages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model,
which is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific
stages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models,
called eDiff-I, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same
inference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming
previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark.
In addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for
conditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. We
show that these different embeddings lead to different behaviors. Notably, the
CLIP image embedding allows an intuitive way of transferring the style of a
reference image to the target text-to-image output. Lastly, we show a technique
that enables eDiff-I's ""paint-with-words"" capability. A user can select the
word in the input text and paint it in a canvas to control the output, which is

We are thus able to define a notion of translation between the outputs of

However, these models do not consider the actual spatial distribution of the

of special importance for an elongated SNAP bottle microresonator (SBM) having
shallow nanometre-scale effective radius variation along its axial length. The
advantage of SBMs compared to microresonators with different shapes (e.g.,
spherical and toroidal) is that SBMs, remaining miniature, can have resonant
spectrum with much smaller free spectral range and no dispersion. Therefore,
SBMs can be used to generate OFCs with much lower repetition rates. We consider
the resonant and adiabatic modulation of parabolic SBMs and show that it is
possible to improve the flatness and increase the bandwidth of the generated
OFC spectra by optimising the SDPM. We suggest that the determined optimal SDPM

investigate deep, rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra of $\simeq 500$
star-forming galaxies at $3 \leq z \leq 5$ selected from the public ESO-VANDELS
spectroscopic survey. The absolute ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{\rm

estimates of the UV attenuation. The ionizing production efficiency
($\xi_{ion}$) is calculated by fitting the far-UV (FUV) stellar continuum of
the VANDELS galaxies. We find that the $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$ and $\xi_{ion}$
parameters increase towards low-mass, blue UV-continuum slopes and strong
Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies, and both are just slightly higher-than-average
for the UV-faintest galaxies in the sample. Potential Lyman Continuum Emitters
(LCEs) and selected Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) show systematically higher
$\xi_{ion}$ ($\log \xi_{ion}$ (Hz\erg) $\approx 25.38, 25.41$) than non-LCEs
and non-LAEs ($\log \xi_{ion}$ (Hz\erg) $\approx 25.18, 25.14$) at similar UV
magnitudes. This indicates very young underlying stellar populations ($\approx
10~{\rm Myr}$) at relatively low metallicities ($\approx 0.2~{\rm Z_{\odot}}$).
The FUV non-ionizing spectra of potential LCEs is characterized by very blue UV
slopes ($\leq -2$), enhanced Ly$\alpha$ emission ($\leq -25$A), strong UV
nebular lines (e.g., high CIV1550/CIII]1908 $\geq 0.75$ ratios), and weak
absorption lines ($\leq 1$A). The latter suggests the existence of low
gas-column-density channels in the interstellar medium which enables the escape
of ionizing photons. By comparing our VANDELS results against other surveys in
the literature, our findings imply that the ionizing budget in the EoR was
likely dominated by UV-faint, low-mass and dustless galaxies.

establish the first experimental link between electron anisotropy and the

coexistence between electron anisotropy and a novel electronic order that
breaks both parity and time reversal symmetry. Combined, the link between

Combining such multimodal data has the potential to improve segmentation of the

consists of three main stages. First, it disentangles the image into high-level

representing the contrast. The high-frequency information is then fed into a
network to learn anatomical features, while the list of multimodal
low-frequency information is processed by another module. Finally, feature
fusion is performed to complete the segmentation task. The proposed method was
used with several iron-sensitive contrasts (iMag, QSM, R2*, SWI). Experiments
demonstrate that our proposed model substantially outperforms a baseline UNet

magnetohydrodynamics. Measurements of magnetic helicity density on the Sun and
other stars are used to interpret the internal behaviour of the dynamo
generating the global magnetic field. In this note, we study the behaviour of
the global relative magnetic helicity in three self-consistent spherical dynamo
solutions of increasing complexity. Magnetic helicity describes the global
linkage of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields (weighted by magnetic
flux), and our results indicate that there are preferred states of this
linkage. This leads us to propose that global magnetic reversals are, perhaps,
a means of preserving this linkage, since, when only one of the poloidal or
toroidal fields reverses, the preferred state of linkage is lost. It is shown
that magnetic helicity indicates the onset of reversals and that this signature
may be observed at the outer surface.

algorithms for the online and stochastic exp-concave optimization settings.
Typical algorithms for these settings, such as the Online Newton Step (ONS),
can guarantee a $O(d\ln T)$ bound on their regret after $T$ rounds, where $d$
is the dimension of the feasible set. However, such algorithms perform
so-called generalized projections whenever their iterates step outside the
feasible set. Such generalized projections require $\Omega(d^3)$ arithmetic
operations even for simple sets such a Euclidean ball, making the total runtime
of ONS of order $d^3 T$ after $T$ rounds, in the worst-case. In this paper, we
side-step generalized projections by using a self-concordant barrier as a
regularizer to compute the Newton steps. This ensures that the iterates are
always within the feasible set without requiring projections. This approach
still requires the computation of the inverse of the Hessian of the barrier at
every step. However, using the stability properties of the Newton steps, we
show that the inverse of the Hessians can be efficiently approximated via
Taylor expansions for most rounds, resulting in a $O(d^2 T +d^\omega \sqrt{T})$
total computational complexity, where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix
multiplication. In the stochastic setting, we show that this translates into a
$O(d^3/\epsilon)$ computational complexity for finding an $\epsilon$-suboptimal
point, answering an open question by Koren 2013. We first show these new
results for the simple case where the feasible set is a Euclidean ball. Then,
to move to general convex set, we use a reduction to Online Convex Optimization
over the Euclidean ball. Our final algorithm can be viewed as a more efficient
version of ONS.

minimum number of polygonal pieces, each of which has bounded size. We give
algorithms for seven notions of `bounded size,' namely that each piece has
bounded area, perimeter, straight-line diameter, geodesic diameter, or that
each piece must be contained in a unit disk, an axis-aligned unit square or an
arbitrarily rotated unit square.
  A more general version of the area problem has already been studied. Here we
are, in addition to $P$, given positive real values $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ such that
the sum $\sum_{i=1}^k a_i$ equals the area of $P$. The goal is to partition $P$
into exactly $k$ pieces $Q_1,\ldots,Q_k$ such that the area of $Q_i$ is $a_i$.
Such a partition always exists, and an algorithm with running time $O(nk)$ has
previously been described, where $n$ is the number of corners of $P$. We give
an algorithm with optimal running time $O(n+k)$. For polygons with holes, we
get running time $O(n\log n+k)$.
  For the other problems, it seems out of reach to compute optimal partitions
for simple polygons; for most of them, even in extremely restricted cases such
as when $P$ is a square. We therefore develop $O(1)$-approximation algorithms
for these problems, which means that the number of pieces in the produced
partition is at most a constant factor larger than the cardinality of a minimum
partition. Existing algorithms do not allow Steiner points, which means that
all corners of the produced pieces must also be corners of $P$. This has the
disappointing consequence that a partition does often not exist, whereas our
algorithms always produce useful partitions. Furthermore, an optimal partition
without Steiner points may require $\Omega(n)$ pieces for polygons where a
partition consisting of just $2$ pieces exists when Steiner points are allowed.

created worldwide deficits in infrastructure service and funding challenges.
Despite rapid advances over the past four decades, sensing technology is still
not a part of bridge inspection protocols. Every time a vehicle with a mobile
device passes over a bridge, there is an opportunity to capture potentially
important structural response information at a very low cost. Prior work has
shown how bridge modal frequencies can be accurately determined with
crowdsourced smartphone-vehicle trip (SVT) data in real-world settings.
However, modal frequencies provide very limited insight on the structural
health conditions of the bridge. Here, we present a novel method to extract
spatial vibration characteristics of real bridges, namely, absolute mode
shapes, from crowdsourced SVT data. These characteristics have a demonstrable
sensitivity to structural damage and provide superior, yet complementary,
indicators of bridge condition. Furthermore, they are useful in the development
of accurate mathematical models of the structural system and help reconcile the
differences between models and real systems. We demonstrate successful
applications on four very different bridges, with span lengths ranging from
about 30 to 1300 meters, collectively representing about one quarter of bridges
in the US. Supplementary work applies this computational approach to accurately
detect simulated bridge damage entirely from crowdsourced SVT data in an
unprecedentedly timely fashion. The results presented in this article open the

the Johnson-Nyquist theorem to handle spatially inhomogeneous temperature

the Wiedemann-Franz law and showed that Joule heating leads to a
geometry-independent increase in Johnson noise. There is a need to provide a
similar generalization for hydrodynamic electron systems, which do not admit a
local conductivity nor obey the Wiedemann-Franz law, since hydrodynamic
electrons provide unusual sensitivity for Johnson noise thermometry. Here we
address this need by considering low-frequency Johnson noise in the
hydrodynamic setting for a rectangular geometry. Unlike in the ohmic setting,
we find that the Johnson noise is no longer geometry-independent due to
non-local viscous gradients. Nonetheless, ignoring the geometric correction
only leads to an error of at most 40% as compared to naively using the ohmic
result.

by a conditional generative model that transforms a given mechanistic operator

condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has
no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically
connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as
superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal
description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase,
utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus
on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected
by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends
on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs
phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has
SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm
analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust
upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined
phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a
boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations.
More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the
emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation
between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase
can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs
condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT
phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge
group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The
sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries,
interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.

prohibitively difficult. In many circumstances, one requires (i) a constrained
Hilbert space and (ii) an extensive quantum superposition. The paradigmatic
example is the toric code, or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which is a
superposition of closed loop states. We show how non-equilibrium Hamiltonian
dynamics can provide a streamlined route toward creating such QSLs. Rather than
cooling into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, we show how a simple parameter
sweep can dynamically project a family of initial product states into the
constrained space, giving rise to a QSL. For the toric code, this is achieved
in systems with a separation in energy scales between the $e$- and $m$-anyons,
where one can sweep in a way that is adiabatic (sudden) with respect to the
former (latter). Although this separation of scales does not extend to the
thermodynamic limit, we analytically and numerically show that this method
efficiently prepares a spin liquid in finite-sized regions, which we brand
``quantum spin lakes.'' This mechanism elucidates recent experimental and
numerical observations of the dynamical state preparation of the ruby lattice
spin liquid in Rydberg atom arrays. In fact, the slow dynamics of $m$-anyons
suggest that we can capture spin lake preparation by simulating the dynamics on
tree lattices, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. Finally, we
use this mechanism to propose new experiments, e.g., for preparing a
finite-sized $U(1)$ spin liquid as a honeycomb Rokhsar-Kivelson dimer model
using Rydberg atoms -- which is remarkable given its equilibrium counterpart is
unstable in $2 + 1$D. Our work opens up a new avenue in the study of
non-equilibrium physics, as well as the exploration of exotic states of finite

$\approx0.1$ dex for a given stellar mass, consistent with the mild evolution

semianalytic dynamical friction and GC-GC merger prescriptions, we study the
evolution of GC radial distributions and mass functions in cuspy and cored dark
matter halos. Modeling the dynamics of the GC-rich system in the dwarf galaxy
UGC7369, we find that friction-induced inspiral and subsequent mergers of
massive GCs can naturally and robustly explain the mass segregation of the GCs
and the existence of a nuclear star cluster (NSC). However, the multiple
mergers required to form the NSC only take place when the dark matter halo is
cuspy. In a cored halo, stalling of the dynamical friction within the core
halts the inspiral of the GCs, and so the GC merger rate falls significantly,
precluding the formation of an NSC. We therefore argue that the presence of an
NSC requires a cusp in UGC7369. More generally, we propose that the presence of
an NSC and the corresponding alteration of the GC mass function due to mergers
may be used as an indicator of a cuspy halo for galaxies in which we expect NSC
formation to be merger-dominated. These observables represent a simple,
powerful complement to other inner halo density profile constraint techniques,
and should allow for straightforward extension to larger samples.

buckling process in terms of the resonant excitation of stellar orbits in the
bar, which pumps energy into vertical oscillations. We find that (1) the
buckling is associated with an abrupt increase in the central mass
concentration and triggers velocities along the bar and along its rotation
axis. The velocity field projected on one of the main axes forms circulation
cells and increases vorticity, which are absent in firehose instability; (2)
The bending amplitude is nonlinear when measured by isodensity contours or
curvature of the Laplace plane, which has a substantial effect on the stellar
motions; (3) In the linear description, the planar and vertical 2:1 resonances
appear only with the buckling and quickly reach the overlapping phase, thus
supporting the energy transfer; (4) Using nonlinear orbit analysis, we analyze
the stellar oscillations along the bar and along the rotation axis and find
that stars cross the vertical 2:1 resonance simultaneously with the buckling.
The overlapping planar and vertical 2:1 resonances trapping more than 25% of
the bar particles provide the 'smoking gun' pointing to a close relationship
between the bending of stellar orbits and the resonant action -- these
particles provide the necessary ingredient assuring the cohesive response in
the growing vertical asymmetry. We conclude that resonant excitation is
important in triggering the buckling instability, and the contribution from the
firehose instability should be reevaluated. Finally, we discuss some
observational implications of buckling.

conductivity and viscosity that enables us to develop a simple and intuitive
analytic 1.5 dimensional model for TRMLs. Our analytic model reproduces the
mass flux, total cooling, and phase structure of 3D simulations of TRMLs at a
fraction of the computational cost. It also reveals essential insights into the
physics of TRMLs, particularly the importance of the viscous dissipation of
relative kinetic energy in balancing radiative cooling. This dissipation takes
place both in the intermediate temperature phase, which offsets the enthalpy
flux from the hot phase, and in the cold phase, which enhances radiative
cooling. Additionally, our model provides a fast and easy way of computing the
column density and surface brightness of TRMLs, which can be directly linked to
observations.

gravitational-wave observations to produce a precise measurement of the
equation of state from binary neutron star inspirals. Since measurability of
the tidal effect depends on the equation of state, we explore several equations
of state that span current observational constraints. We generate a population
of binary neutron stars as seen by a simulated Advanced LIGO-Virgo network, as
well as by a planned Cosmic Explorer observatory. We perform Bayesian inference
to measure the parameters of each signal, and we combine measurements across
each population to determine $R_{1.4}$, the radius of a $1.4M_{\odot}$ neutron
star. We find that with 321 signals the LIGO-Virgo network is able to measure
$R_{1.4}$ to better than 2% precision for all equations of state we consider,
however we find that achieving this precision could take decades of
observation, depending on the equation of state and the merger rate. On the
other hand we find that with one year of observation, Cosmic Explorer will
measure $R_{1.4}$ to better than 0.6% precision. In both cases we find that
systematic biases, such as from an incorrect mass prior, can significantly
impact measurement accuracy and efforts will be required to mitigate these

reach a flavor equipartition even in cases with low growth rate of instability

where flavor conversions occur vigorously. This exhibits that ELN and XLN
angular distributions can not provide a sufficient information to determine

equations for the double occupations $\langle
n^{}_{\alpha,\sigma}n^{}_{\beta,\sigma'}\rangle$ by sampling them directly for
the same model using DMFT. Compared to the usual Hartree-Fock like ansatz, this
leads to more accurate local vertices in the weakly correlated regime, and
provides access to stronger correlated systems that were previously out of
reach. This approach is extended by replacing the local component of the TPSC
self-energy by the DMFT impurity self-energy, which results in an improved
self-energy that incorporates strong local correlations but retains a
non-trivial momentum-dependence. We find that this combination of TPSC and DMFT
provides a significant improvement over the multi-orbital formulation of
multi-orbital TPSC, as it allows to determine the components of the spin vertex
without artificial symmetry assumptions, and opens the possibility to include
the transversal particle-hole channel. The new approach is also able to remove
unphysical divergences in the charge vertices in TPSC. We find a general trend

utilizes Hamiltonian dynamics to produce sample proposals informed by
first-order gradients of the model likelihood. This in turn allows it to
converge faster to high dimensional distributions. We implement HMC as an
alternative sampling method in our search for an isotropic stochastic GW

The transient is observed on the negative-parity side of the critical curve at

Using the generalized expression of the GW energy-momentum tensor and the
modified propagation law for the tensor modes, we conclude that the energy
density of a SGWB maintains the same functional relation with the scale factor
as in GR, provided that the modified theory coincides with GR in a given
hypersurface of constant time. However, the relation between the detected

operator are density-dependent, leads to volume-exclusion chemotactic
equations. We generalise an asymptotic preserving scheme for such nonlinear
kinetic equations based on a micro-macro decomposition. By properly
discretizing the nonlinear term implicitly-explicitly in an upwind manner, the
scheme produces accurate approximations also in the case of strong
chemosensitivity. We show, via detailed calculations, that the scheme presents
the following properties: asymptotic preserving, positivity preserving and
energy dissipation, which are essential for practical applications. We extend
this scheme to two dimensional kinetic models and we validate its efficiency by
means of 1D and 2D numerical experiments of pattern formation in biological
systems.

inconsistent with the fundamental metallicity relation, although there is
likely significant dust obscuration of the stellar mass, which may partly
resolve the inconsistency. Given a solar metallicity, the dust-to-metals ratio
is a factor of several lower than expected, hinting that galaxies beyond $z

nitrogen enrichment compared to oxygen, on which the metallicity measurement

a nonlinear coupled system of first order differential equations of hyperbolic

separation in the dynamics of the variables. We show that this simplified model
accurately predicts the expected transition between a neutral consensus and a

exemplary family of states - the Rokhsar-Kivelson-sign wavefunctions - whose
degree of entanglement is controlled by a single parameter. This family of
states is known to feature a transition between a phase exhibiting volume-law
scaling of entanglement entropy and a phase with sub-extensive scaling of
entanglement, reminiscent of the many-body-localization transition of
disordered quantum Hamiltonians [Physical Review B 92, 214204 (2015)]. We study
the singularities of the Rokhsar-Kivelson-sign wavefunctions and their
entanglement complexity across the transition using several tools from quantum
information theory: fidelity metric; entanglement spectrum statistics;
entanglement entropy fluctuations; stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy; and the
performance of a disentangling algorithm. Across the whole volume-law phase the
states feature universal entanglement spectrum statistics. Yet a
""super-universal"" regime appears for small values of the control parameter in
which all metrics become independent of the parameter itself; the entanglement
entropy as well as the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy appear to approach their
theoretical maximum; the entanglement fluctuations scale to zero as in output
states of random universal circuits, and the disentangling algorithm has
essentially null efficiency. All these indicators consistently reveal a complex
pattern of entanglement. In the sub-volume-law phase, on the other hand, the
entanglement spectrum statistics is no longer universal, entanglement
fluctuations are larger and exhibiting a non-universal scaling; and the
efficiency of the disentangling algorithm becomes finite. Our results, based on
model wavefunctions, suggest that a similar combination of entanglement scaling
properties and of entanglement complexity features may be found in high-energy
Hamiltonian eigenstates.

data used to identify areas of the brain that activate during specific tasks or
stimuli. These data are conventionally modeled using a massive univariate
approach across all data locations, which ignores spatial dependence at the
cost of model power. We previously developed and validated a spatial Bayesian
model leveraging dependencies along the cortical surface of the brain in order
to improve accuracy and power. This model utilizes stochastic partial
differential equation spatial priors with sparse precision matrices to allow
for appropriate modeling of spatially-dependent activations seen in the
neuroimaging literature, resulting in substantial increases in model power. Our
original implementation relies on the computational efficiencies of the
integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to overcome the computational
challenges of analyzing high-dimensional fMRI data while avoiding issues
associated with variational Bayes implementations. However, this requires
significant memory resources, extra software, and software licenses to run. In
this article, we develop an exact Bayesian analysis method for the general
linear model, employing an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm to find
maximum a posteriori estimates of task-based regressors on cortical surface
fMRI data. Through an extensive simulation study of cortical surface-based fMRI
data, we compare our proposed method to the existing INLA implementation, as
well as a conventional massive univariate approach employing ad-hoc spatial
smoothing. We also apply the method to task fMRI data from the Human Connectome
Project and show that our proposed implementation produces similar results to
the validated INLA implementation. Both the INLA and EM-based implementations
are available through our open-source BayesfMRI R package.

asteroid-like orbits in the Main Asteroid Belt. MBCs and candidates show
stronger clustering of their longitudes of perihelion around 15{\deg} than
other objects from the Outer Main Belt (OMB). This potential property of MBCs
could facilitate the discovery of new candidates by observing objects in
similar orbits. We acquired deep r-band images of 534 targeted asteroids using
the INT/WFC between 2018 and 2020. Our sample is comprised of OMB objects
observed near perihelion, with longitudes of perihelion between 0{\deg} and
30{\deg} and orbital parameters similar to knowns MBCs. Our pipeline applied
activity detection methods to 319 of these objects to look for tails or comae,
and we visually inspected the remaining asteroids. Our activity detection
pipeline highlighted a faint anti-solar tail-like feature around 2001 NL19
(279870) observed on 2018 November 07, six months after perihelion. This is
consistent with cometary activity but additional observations of this object
will be needed during its next perihelion to investigate its potential MBC
status. If it is active our survey yields a detection rate of $\sim$1:300,

  feature-size printing",,,,,"physics.optics physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The recent development of light-based 3D printing technologies has marked a
turning point in additive manufacturing. Through photopolymerization, liquid
resins can be solidified into complex objects. Usually, the polymerization is
triggered by exciting a photoinitiator with ultraviolet (UV) or blue light. In
two-photon printing (TPP), the excitation is done through the non-linear
absorption of two photons; it enables printing 100-nm voxels but requires
expensive femtosecond lasers which strongly limits their broad dissemination.
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have recently been proposed as an
alternative to TPP for photopolymerization but using continuous-wave lasers.
UCNPs convert near-infrared (NIR) into visible/UV light to initiate the
polymerization locally as in TPP. Here we provide a study of this multi-photon
mechanism and demonstrate how the non-linearity impacts the printing process.
In particular, we report on the possibility of fine-tuning the size of the
printed voxel by adjusting the NIR excitation intensity. Using gelatin-based
hydrogel, we are able to vary the transverse voxel size from 1.3 to 2.8 {\mu}m
and the axial size from 7.7 to 59 {\mu}m by adjusting the NIR power without
changing the degree of polymerization. This work opens up new opportunities for
speeding up the fabrication while preserving the minimum feature size with
cheap light sources.

extract the key dimensionless parameters. We then apply asymptotic methods in

  played by the strengthening of P Cygni absorption lines","17 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Over the entire 20th century, Eta Carinae (\ec) has displayed a unique
spectrum, which recently has been evolving towards that of a typical LBV. The
two competing scenarios to explain such evolution are: (1) a dissipating
occulter in front of a stable star or (2) a decreasing mass loss rate of the
star. The first mechanism simultaneously explains why the central star appears
to be secularly increasing its apparent brightness while its luminosity does
not change; why the Homunculus' apparent brightness remains almost constant;
and why the spectrum seen in direct light is becoming more similar to that
reflected from the Homunculus (and which resembles a typical LBV). The second
scenario does not account for these facts and predicts an increase in the
terminal speed of the wind, contrary to observations. In this work, we present
new data showing that the P Cygni absorption lines are secularly strengthening,
which is not the expected behaviour for a decreasing wind-density scenario.
CMFGEN modelling of the primary's wind with a small occulter in front agrees
with observations. One could argue that invoking a dissipating coronagraphic
occulter makes this object even more peculiar than it already appears to be.
However, on the contrary, it solves the apparent contradictions between many
observations. Moreover, by assigning the long-term behaviour to circumstellar
causes and the periodic variations due to binarity, a star more stable after
the 1900s than previously thought is revealed, contrary to the earlier paradigm
of an unpredictable object.

to the singular Cucker-Smale model. First, we prove that weak measure-valued

monokinetic, under very mild assumptions that they are uniformly compactly

derivation of the macroscopic fractional Euler-alignment system from kinetic

  This suggests superior suitability of the macroscopic framework to describe
large-crowd limits of strongly singular Cucker-Smale dynamics.

leads to the final result -- existence of weak solutions to the fractional

optimize expensive-to-evaluate functions. Each of the BO components, such as
the surrogate model, the acquisition function (AF), or the initial design, is
subject to a wide range of design choices. Selecting the right components for a
given optimization task is a challenging task, which can have significant
impact on the quality of the obtained results. In this work, we initiate the
analysis of which AF to favor for which optimization scenarios. To this end, we
benchmark SMAC3 using Expected Improvement (EI) and Probability of Improvement
(PI) as acquisition functions on the 24 BBOB functions of the COCO environment.
We compare their results with those of schedules switching between AFs. One
schedule aims to use EI's explorative behavior in the early optimization steps,
and then switches to PI for a better exploitation in the final steps. We also
compare this to a random schedule and round-robin selection of EI and PI. We
observe that dynamic schedules oftentimes outperform any single static one. Our
results suggest that a schedule that allocates the first 25 % of the
optimization budget to EI and the last 75 % to PI is a reliable default.
However, we also observe considerable performance differences for the 24
functions, suggesting that a per-instance allocation, possibly learned on the
fly, could offer significant improvement over the state-of-the-art BO designs.

where the lepton is an electron or muon. The products of the hadronic top quark
decay are reconstructed using a single large-radius jet with transverse
momentum greater than 400 GeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at
the LHC in proton-proton collisions and correspond to an integrated luminosity
of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The differential $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ production cross section
as a function of the jet mass is unfolded to the particle level and is used to
extract the top quark mass. The jet mass scale is calibrated using the hadronic
W boson decay within the large-radius jet. The uncertainties in the modelling
of the final state radiation are reduced by studying angular correlations in
the jet substructure. These developments lead to a significant increase in
precision, and a top quark mass of 172.76 $\pm$ 0.81 GeV.

detect CS points and transcribe speech segments of one language while ignoring
those of other languages -- not a trivial task. We propose to simplify each
monolingual module by allowing them to transcribe all speech segments
indiscriminately with a monolingual script (i.e. transliteration). This simple
modification passes the responsibility of CS point detection to subsequent
bilingual modules which determine the final output by considering multiple
monolingual transliterations along with external language model information. We

a data structure of size $\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-1})$ which can be used to
return $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximations to effective resistances in
$\widetilde{O}(1)$ time per query. Short of storing all effective resistances,
previous best approaches could achieve $\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-2})$ size and
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ time per query by storing Johnson-Lindenstrauss
vectors for each vertex, or $\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-1})$ size and
$\widetilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-1})$ time per query by storing a spectral sketch.
  Our construction is based on two key ideas: 1) $\epsilon^{-1}$-sparse,
$\epsilon$-additive approximations to $DL^+1_u$ for all $u,$ can be used to
recover $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximations to the effective resistances, 2) In
expander graphs, only $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ coordinates of a vector
similar to $DL^+1_u$ are larger than $\epsilon.$ We give an efficient
construction for such a data structure in $\widetilde{O}(m + n\epsilon^{-2})$
time via random walks. This results in an algorithm for computing
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate effective resistances for $s$ vertex pairs in
expanders that runs in $\widetilde{O}(m + n\epsilon^{-2} + s)$ time, improving
over the previously best known running time of $m^{1 + o(1)} + (n +

  We employ the above algorithm to compute a $(1+\delta)$-approximation to the
number of spanning trees in an expander graph, or equivalently, approximating
the (pseudo)determinant of its Laplacian in $\widetilde{O}(m +
n^{1.5}\delta^{-1})$ time. This improves on the previously best known result of

discriminator directly providing a probability that quantifies distributional

return, with the other capturing the ``remainder'' of the data distribution in

exoplanet/ brown-dwarf boundary. We based this study on a rich set of
observations to investigate the companion's orbit and atmosphere. We composed a
spectrum of AB Pic b merging archival VLT/SINFONI K-band data, with published
spectra at J and H-band (SINFONI) and Lp-band (Magellan-AO), and photometric
measurements (HST and Spitzer). We modeled the spectrum with ForMoSA, based on
two atmospheric models: ExoREM and BT-SETTL13. We determined the orbital
properties of b fitting the astrometric measurements from NaCo (2003 and 2004)
and SPHERE (2015). The orbital solutions favor a semi-major axis of $\sim$190au
viewed edge-on. With Exo-REM, we derive a T$_{eff}$ of 1700$\pm$50K and surface
gravity of 4.5$\pm$0.3dex, consistent with previous works, and we report for
the first time a C/O ratio of 0.58$\pm$0.08 ($\sim$solar). The posteriors are
sensitive to the wavelength interval and the family of models used. Given the
2.1hr rotation period and our vsin(i) of $\sim$73km/s, we estimate for the
first time the true obliquity to be $\sim$45 or $\sim$135deg, indicating a
significant misalignment between the planet's spin and orbit orientations.
Finally, a proper motion anomaly between the Hipparcos and Gaia eDR3 compared
to our SPHERE detection limits and adapted radial velocity limits indicate the
existence of a $\sim$6M$_{Jup}$ inner planet orbiting from 2 to 10au
(40-200mas). The possible existence of an inner companion and the likely
miss-alignment of the spin axis orientation strongly favor a formation path by
gravitational instability or core accretion within a disk closer inside
followed by dynamical interactions. Confirmation and characterization of planet
c and access to a broader wavelength coverage for planet b will be essential to
probe the uncertainties associated with the parameters.

models train a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a given learning task. The
success of these algorithms greatly hinges on appropriately choosing an ansatz
for the quantum circuit. Perhaps one of the most famous ansatzes is the
one-dimensional layered Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), which seeks to
minimize the effect of hardware noise by using native gates and connectives.
The use of this HEA has generated a certain ambivalence arising from the fact
that while it suffers from barren plateaus at long depths, it can also avoid
them at shallow ones. In this work, we attempt to determine whether one should,
or should not, use a HEA. We rigorously identify scenarios where shallow HEAs
should likely be avoided (e.g., VQA or QML tasks with data satisfying a volume
law of entanglement). More importantly, we identify a Goldilocks scenario where
shallow HEAs could achieve a quantum speedup: QML tasks with data satisfying an
area law of entanglement. We provide examples for such scenario (such as
Gaussian diagonal ensemble random Hamiltonian discrimination), and we show that
in these cases a shallow HEA is always trainable and that there exists an
anti-concentration of loss function values. Our work highlights the crucial
role that input states play in the trainability of a parametrized quantum
circuit, a phenomenon that is verified in our numerics.

settings, it is unclear how to design artificial agents that can learn to
effectively and efficiently communicate with each other. Much research on
communication emergence uses reinforcement learning (RL) and explores
unsituated communication in one-step referential tasks -- the tasks are not
temporally interactive and lack time pressures typically present in natural
communication. In these settings, agents may successfully learn to communicate,
but they do not learn to exchange information concisely -- they tend towards
over-communication and an inefficient encoding. Here, we explore situated
communication in a multi-step task, where the acting agent has to forgo an
environmental action to communicate. Thus, we impose an opportunity cost on
communication and mimic the real-world pressure of passing time. We compare
communication emergence under this pressure against learning to communicate
with a cost on articulation effort, implemented as a per-message penalty (fixed
and progressively increasing). We find that while all tested pressures can
disincentivise over-communication, situated communication does it most
effectively and, unlike the cost on effort, does not negatively impact
emergence. Implementing an opportunity cost on communication in a temporally
extended environment is a step towards embodiment, and might be a pre-condition
for incentivising efficient, human-like communication.

physics-inspired machine learning model that bridges the gap between
large-scale drivers and short-term dynamics of the power system. Integrating
stochastic differential equations and artificial neural networks, we construct
a probabilistic model of the power grid frequency dynamics in Continental
Europe. Its probabilistic prediction outperforms the daily average profile,
which is an important benchmark. Using the integrated model, we identify and
explain the parameters of the dynamical system from the data, which reveals
their strong time-dependence and their relation to external drivers such as
wind power feed-in and fast generation ramps. Finally, we generate synthetic

All in all, our work emphasises the importance of modelling power system

  We apply Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to this problem of assessing the

productive efficiency of abstract units that consume one or more inputs and
yield at least one output. We recast natural language models as units suitable

it identifies a subset of models that live on an efficient frontier of

inclusion of these more complex terms should require a higher level of
evidence. In time series, the same idea of ranked prior skepticism can be
applied to the possibly seasonal autoregressive (AR) structure of the series

uncertain or multiple modes of seasonality. The SRL can naturally incorporate
exogenous variables, with streamlined options for inference and/or feature

cluster outskirts. The strength of the emission requires a magnetic field
energy density at least 100 times higher than expected from a simple
compression of primordial fields, presumably implying that dynamo operates

a novel regression compatible ranking (RCR) approach to achieve a better
trade-off. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the regression and
ranking components are well aligned which brings new opportunities for
harmonious regression and ranking. Theoretically, we show that the two
components share the same minimizer at global minima while the regression
component ensures scale calibration. Empirically, we show that the proposed
approach performs well on both regression and ranking metrics on several public
LTR datasets, and significantly improves the Pareto frontiers in the context of
multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, we evaluated the proposed approach

calibrated to realize high-fidelity quantum operations. Typical calibration
methods either assume that circuit elements can be effectively decoupled and
simple models can be applied, or require a large amount of data. Such methods
become ineffective as the system size increases and circuit interactions become

that superconducting circuits respond periodically to external fluxes,
crosstalk calibration of N flux channels can be treated as N independent
optimization problems, with the objective functions being the periodicity of a

optimization problem to find the largest deviation of a supervised learning

interpretability facilitates this safety assessment. For models including
decision trees, generalized linear and additive models, the maximum deviation
can be computed exactly and efficiently. For tree ensembles, which are not
regarded as interpretable, discrete optimization techniques can still provide
informative bounds. For a broader class of piecewise Lipschitz functions, we

package DraGMet on the Dragonfly mission, which will explore the surface of
Titan in the mid-2030s. EFIELD consists of two electrodes designed to passively
record the AC electric field at each landing site.
  The exploration zone of Dragonfly will mostly consist of dune fields, covered
with sand grains. Little is known on the properties of these grains, although
Cassini-Huygens observations suggest they are mostly made of organic material
produced by Titan's atmospheric photochemistry and evolved at the surface.
Little is known also about dune formation and in general about the transport of
sediments by winds. The latter much depends on inter-particle forces and
therefore on how grains are charged by friction. We demonstrate here that the
EFIELD experiment can bring new insights on these questions.
  We have developed a hydrodynamic-electrostatic model to simulate the
trajectory of a wind-blown charged sand grain in the vicinity of an idealized
EFIELD probe and to predict how such a grain flying close to the probe would
affect its potential. We show that, in some conditions, the resulting
perturbation will be strong enough to be detected by the EFIELD probe. More
specifically, we find that the detection of typical charged wind-blown grains
(200 microns) on Titan requires an instrument standard deviation noise inferior
to 1mV, though occasional larger grains flying close to one electrode could be
detected with a higher noise level.
  Furthermore, we propose a method to retrieve information on the charge and
velocity of wind-blown charged grains detected by the EFIELD experiment. This
method well applies for cases where the particle trajectory can be regarded as
quasi-linear. We validate our inversion approach on both synthetic and

``Gordon approach'' and a highly accurate compact finite differentiation method

Modern neutrino experiments employ hundreds to tens of thousands of photon
detectors to observe signal from millions to billions of scintillation photons
produced from energy deposition of charged particles. These neutrino detectors
are typically large, containing kilotons of target volume, with different
optical properties. Modeling individual photon propagation in form of look-up
table requires huge computational resources. As the size of a table increases
with detector volume for a fixed resolution, this method scales poorly for
future larger detectors. Alternative approaches such as fitting a polynomial to
the model could address the memory issue, but results in poorer performance.
Both look-up table and fitting approaches are prone to discrepancies between
the detector simulation and the data collected. We propose a new approach using
SIREN, an implicit neural representation with periodic activation functions, to
model the look-up table as a 3D scene and reproduces the acceptance map with
high accuracy. The number of parameters in our SIREN model is orders of
magnitude smaller than the number of voxels in the look-up table. As it models
an underlying functional shape, SIREN is scalable to a larger detector.
Furthermore, SIREN can successfully learn the spatial gradients of the photon
library, providing additional information for downstream applications. Finally,
as SIREN is a neural network representation, it is differentiable with respect
to its parameters, and therefore tunable via gradient descent. We demonstrate
the potential of optimizing SIREN directly on real data, which mitigates the
concern of data vs. simulation discrepancies. We further present an application
for data reconstruction where SIREN is used to form a likelihood function for
photon statistics.

incident CR ion properties as well as the physicochemical character of the ice
mantle. Our main objective is the examination of the sputtering efficiency for
H$_2$O and CO ices found in molecular cloud cores. In the calculation routine,
we consider a multi-dimensional parameter space that consists of thirty CR ion
types, five different CR ion energy flux distributions, two separate ice mantle
components (pure H$_2$O and CO), three ice formation states, and two sputtering
regimes (linear and quadratic). We find that the sputtering behavior of H$_2$O
and CO ices is dominated by the quadratic regime rather than the linear regime,
especially for CO sputtering. The sputtering rate coefficients for H$_2$O and
CO ices show distinct variations with respect to the adopted CR ion energy flux
as well as the grain size-dependent mantle depth. The maximum radius of the
cylindrical latent region is quite sensitive to the effective electronic
stopping power. The track radii for CO ice are much bigger than H$_2$O ice
values. In contrast to the H$_2$O mantle, even relatively light CR ions ($Z

localization algorithms more robust. Traditionally, these marker locations are
selected by humans who are familiar with visual localization techniques. This
paper explores the problem of automatic marker placement within a scene.
Specifically, given a predetermined set of markers and a scene model, we
compute optimized marker positions within the scene that can improve accuracy
in visual localization. Our main contribution is a novel framework for modeling
camera localizability that incorporates both natural scene features and
artificial fiducial markers added to the scene. We present optimized marker
placement (OMP), a greedy algorithm that is based on the camera localizability
framework. We have also designed a simulation framework for testing marker
placement algorithms on 3D models and images generated from synthetic scenes.
We have evaluated OMP within this testbed and demonstrate an improvement in the
localization rate by up to 20 percent on four different scenes.

of quantum mechanical states, called Fock states, with an exact integer number
of photons. Despite these fundamental states being long-understood, and despite
their many potential applications, generating them is largely an open problem.
For example, at optical frequencies, it is challenging to deterministically
generate Fock states of order two and beyond. Here, we predict the existence of
a new effect in nonlinear optics, which enables the deterministic generation of
large Fock states at arbitrary frequencies. The effect, which we call an
n-photon bound state in the continuum, is one in which a photonic resonance
(such as a cavity mode) becomes lossless when a precise number of photons n is
inside the resonance. Based on analytical theory and numerical simulations, we
show that these bound states enable a remarkable phenomenon in which a coherent
state of light, when injected into a system supporting this bound state, can
spontaneously evolve into a Fock state of a controllable photon number. This
effect is also directly applicable for creating (highly) squeezed states of
light, whose photon number fluctuations are (far) below the value expected from
classical physics (i.e., shot noise). We suggest several examples of systems to
experimentally realize the effects predicted here in nonlinear nanophotonic
systems, showing examples of generating both optical Fock states with large n
(n > 10), as well as more macroscopic photonic states with very large
squeezing, with over 90% less noise (10 dB) than the classical value associated
with shot noise.

the constraints on observational tools, especially for short GRBs, it is
paramount that the groundwork is laid for the day we have abundant data. In
this work, we present a polarization model linked with an off-axis spreading
top-hat jet synchrotron scenario in a stratified environment with a density

We examine two BBLs of different molecular masses from different sources. Both
BBLs show significant film swelling during the initial reduction step. By
combining electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (eQCM) gravimetry,
in-operando atomic force microscopy (AFM), and both ex-situ and in-operando
grazing incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS), we provide a detailed
structural picture of the electrochemical charge injection process in BBL in
the absence of any hydrophilic side-chains. Compared with ex-situ measurements,
in-operando GIWAXS shows both more swelling upon electrochemical doping than
has previously been recognized, and less contraction upon dedoping. The data
show that BBL films undergo an irreversible hydration driven by the initial
electrochemical doping cycle with significant water retention and lamellar
expansion that persists across subsequent oxidation/reduction cycles. This
swelling creates a hydrophilic environment that facilitates the subsequent fast
hydrated ion transport in the absence of the hydrophilic side-chains used in
many other polymer systems. Due to its rigid ladder backbone and absence of
hydrophilic side-chains, the primary BBL water uptake does not significantly
degrade the crystalline order, and the original dehydrated, unswelled state can
be recovered after drying. The combination of doping induced hydrophilicity and
robust crystalline order leads to efficient ionic transport and good stability.

selective inference, failure to account for the selection step leads, in this
setting, to excessively conservative (as opposed to anti-conservative) results.
Our proposed test properly accounts for the fact that the set of variables is

experiments on four massive haloes from the Feedback in Realistic Environments
(FIRE) project. Our starting point is four star-forming, central galaxies at
seven redshifts between z=1.5 and z=4.5. We generate modified quiescent
galaxies that have been quenched for 100Myr, 500Myr, or 1Gyr prior to each of
the studied redshifts by re-assigning stellar ages. We derive spectral energy
distributions for each fiducial and modified galaxy using radiative transfer.
We demonstrate that the dust mass inferred is highly dependent on the assumed
dust temperature, T_dust, which is often unconstrained observationally.
Motivated by recent work on quiescent galaxies that assumed T_dust~25K, we show
that the ratio between dust mass and 1.3mm flux density can be higher than
inferred by up to an order of magnitude, due to the considerably lower dust
temperatures seen in non star-forming galaxies. This can lead to an
underestimation of dust mass (and, when sub-mm flux density is used as a proxy
for molecular gas content, gas mass). This underestimation is most severe at
higher redshifts, where the observed-frame 1.3mm flux density probes rest-frame
wavelengths far from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, and hence depends
super-linearly on dust temperature. We fit relations between ratios of
rest-frame far-infrared flux densities and mass-weighted dust temperature that
can be used to constrain dust temperatures from observations and hence derive
more reliable dust and molecular gas masses.

better damage targets. Thus, it makes them difficult to analyze and detect with
traditional endpoint detection and response, intrusion detection and prevention

to use an algebraic topological approach called topological-based data analysis
(TDA) to efficiently analyze and detect complex malware patterns. Next, we
compare the different TDA techniques (i.e., persistence homology, tomato, TDA

also propose some recommendations to deploy the best-identified models for

better for clustering and for identifying hidden relationships between malware
clusters compared to PCA. Persistent diagrams are better to identify
overlapping malware clusters with low execution time compared to UMAP and

the performance on the previous task as the parameters are updated, to avoid
the catastrophic forgetting problem. Then we can continually train the model
within this region only with the new training data to fit the new task.
Specifically, we propose two methods to search the low forgetting risk regions,
which are based on the curvature of loss and the impacts of the parameters on
the model output, respectively. We conduct experiments on domain adaptation and
more challenging language adaptation tasks, and the experimental results show
that our method can achieve significant improvements compared with several

Taking road segment as the basic unit, we characterize mixed functions
aggregation of road networks with the number of POIs categories within 100
meters around every road segment. At the same time, on the basis of centrality
measurement in graph theory, we use 4 indexes to reflect the characteristics of
the urban road network structure, including degree, closeness, betweenness, and
length. We conduct our methods and experiments using the road networks and POI

road networks inherently influence the aggregation of urban mixed functions in
various patterns and the patterns of road network sub-structures is also quite
different. Our study shows that the higher the degree of the road network
structure has, the more likely it will attract functions' aggregation. It also
reveals that diversified local degree will help gather urban functions. In

socio-economic issues. For law enforcement agencies, understanding crime
patterns is essential for preventing future criminal activity. For this
purpose, these agencies need structured crime database. This paper introduces a
novel crime dataset that contains temporal, geographic, weather, and
demographic data about 6574 crime incidents of Bangladesh. We manually gather
crime news articles of a seven year time span from a daily newspaper archive.
We extract basic features from these raw text. Using these basic features, we
then consult standard service-providers of geo-location and weather data in
order to garner these information related to the collected crime incidents.
Furthermore, we collect demographic information from Bangladesh National Census
data. All these information are combined that results in a standard machine
learning dataset. Together, 36 features are engineered for the crime prediction
task. Five supervised machine learning classification algorithms are then
evaluated on this newly built dataset and satisfactory results are achieved. We
also conduct exploratory analysis on various aspects the dataset. This dataset
is expected to serve as the foundation for crime incidence prediction systems
for Bangladesh and other countries. The findings of this study will help law
enforcement agencies to forecast and contain crime as well as to ensure optimal
resource allocation for crime patrol and prevention.

object detection (M3OD). However, it has been neglected by most mainstream
methods. In this paper, we identify two key factors that limit the
applicability of ground plane prior: the projection point localization issue
and the ground plane tilt issue. To pick up the ground plane prior for M3OD, we
propose a Ground Plane Enhanced Network (GPENet) which resolves both issues at
one go. For the projection point localization issue, instead of using the
bottom vertices or bottom center of the 3D bounding box (BBox), we leverage the
object's ground contact points, which are explicit pixels in the image and easy
for the neural network to detect. For the ground plane tilt problem, our GPENet
estimates the horizon line in the image and derives a novel mathematical
expression to accurately estimate the ground plane equation. An unsupervised
vertical edge mining algorithm is also proposed to address the occlusion of the
horizon line. Furthermore, we design a novel 3D bounding box deduction method
based on a dynamic back projection algorithm, which could take advantage of the
accurate contact points and the ground plane equation. Additionally, using only
M3OD labels, contact point and horizon line pseudo labels can be easily
generated with NO extra data collection and label annotation cost. Extensive
experiments on the popular KITTI benchmark show that our GPENet can outperform
other methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance, well demonstrating the
effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed approach. Moreover, our
GPENet works better than other methods in cross-dataset evaluation on the

quantized vortex lines in the superfluid [2]. This quantum dissipation
mechanism is the key for understanding various fascinating behaviors of the

By examining how the rings spontaneously shrink and accelerate, we provide
unequivocal evidences showing that only a recent theory [9] which accounts for

rationalizing LMs require expensive rationale annotation and/or computation,
without any assurance that their generated rationales improve LM task
performance or faithfully reflect LM decision-making. In this paper, we propose
PINTO, an LM pipeline that rationalizes via prompt-based learning, and learns
to faithfully reason over rationales via counterfactual regularization. First,
PINTO maps out a suitable reasoning process for the task input by prompting a
frozen rationalizing LM to generate a free-text rationale. Second, PINTO's
reasoning LM is fine-tuned to solve the task using the generated rationale as
context, while regularized to output less confident predictions when the
rationale is perturbed. Across four datasets, we show that PINTO significantly
improves the generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. Also, we
find that PINTO's rationales are more faithful to its task predictions than
those generated by competitive baselines.

These efforts include forward modeling, numerical simulations, and inversions.
In this paper, we focus our attention on the uncertainties associated with the
thermodynamic model atmosphere obtained after the inversion of the Mg II h & k
lines. We have used ~ 50;000 synthetic representative profiles of the IRIS2
database to characterize the most important source of uncertainties in the
inversion process, viz.: the inherent noise of the observations, the random
initialization of process, and the selection criteria in a high-dimensional
space. We have applied a Monte Carlo approach to this problem. Thus, for a
given synthetic representative profile, we have created five randomized noise
realizations (representative of the most popular exposure times in the IRIS
observations), and inverted these profiles five times with different inversion
initializations. The resulting 25 inverted profiles, fits to noisy data, and
model atmospheres are then used to determine the uncertainty in the model
atmosphere, based on the standard deviation and empirical selection criteria
for the goodness of fit. With this approach, the new uncertainties of the
models available in the IRIS2 database are more reliable at the optical depths
where the Mg II h & k lines are sensitive to changes in the thermodynamics.

Previous studies have proposed that BLAPs may be pre-white dwarfs, with masses
around $0.3M_\odot$, or core-helium-burning stars in the range of $\sim
0.7-1.1M_\odot$. In this work, we use a number of MESA models to compute and

B (SHeB sdBs). The models that best match existing observational constraints
have helium core masses in the range of $\sim 0.45-0.5M_\odot$. Our model
predicts that the positive rate of period change may evolve to negative. The
formation channels for SHeB sdBs involve binary evolution and although the vast
majority of BLAPs do not appear to be binaries (with the exception of HD
133729), the observational constraints are still very poor. Motivated by these
findings, we explored the Roche lobe overflow channel. Of the 304 binary
evolution models we computed, about half of them are able to produce SHeB sdBs
in long-period binaries that evade detection from the limited observations that

we propose a phonetic-assisted multi-target units (PMU) modeling approach, to
enhance the Conformer-Transducer ASR system in a progressive representation
learning manner. Specifically, PMU first uses the pronunciation-assisted
subword modeling (PASM) and byte pair encoding (BPE) to produce
phonetic-induced and text-induced target units separately; Then, three new
frameworks are investigated to enhance the acoustic encoder, including a basic
PMU, a paraCTC and a pcaCTC, they integrate the PASM and BPE units at different
levels for CTC and transducer multi-task training. Experiments on both
LibriSpeech and accented ASR tasks show that, the proposed PMU significantly
outperforms the conventional BPE, it reduces the WER of LibriSpeech clean,
other, and six accented ASR testsets by relative 12.7%, 6.0% and 7.7%,
respectively.

collaboratively train a machine learning model in a privacy-preserving manner.
Personalized federated learning extends this paradigm to overcome heterogeneity
across clients by learning personalized models. Recently, there have been some
initial attempts to apply Transformers to federated learning. However, the
impacts of federated learning algorithms on self-attention have not yet been
studied. This paper investigates this relationship and reveals that federated
averaging algorithms actually have a negative impact on self-attention where
there is data heterogeneity. These impacts limit the capabilities of the
Transformer model in federated learning settings. Based on this, we propose
FedTP, a novel Transformer-based federated learning framework that learns
personalized self-attention for each client while aggregating the other
parameters among the clients. Instead of using a vanilla personalization
mechanism that maintains personalized self-attention layers of each client
locally, we develop a learn-to-personalize mechanism to further encourage the
cooperation among clients and to increase the scablability and generalization
of FedTP. Specifically, the learn-to-personalize is realized by learning a
hypernetwork on the server that outputs the personalized projection matrices of
self-attention layers to generate client-wise queries, keys and values.
Furthermore, we present the generalization bound for FedTP with the
learn-to-personalize mechanism. Notably, FedTP offers a convenient environment
for performing a range of image and language tasks using the same federated
network architecture - all of which benefit from Transformer personalization.
Extensive experiments verify that FedTP with the learn-to-personalize mechanism
yields state-of-the-art performance in non-IID scenarios. Our code is available
online.

architecture, learnt weights, training details etc.) from third-party users by
exposing them only as black boxes through APIs. Moreover, they may not even
provide access to the training data due to proprietary reasons or sensitivity
concerns. We make the first attempt to provide adversarial robustness to the
black box models in a data-free set up. We construct synthetic data via
generative model and train surrogate network using model stealing techniques.
To minimize adversarial contamination on perturbed samples, we propose `wavelet
noise remover' (WNR) that performs discrete wavelet decomposition on input
images and carefully select only a few important coefficients determined by our
`wavelet coefficient selection module' (WCSM). To recover the high-frequency
content of the image after noise removal via WNR, we further train a
`regenerator' network with an objective to retrieve the coefficients such that
the reconstructed image yields similar to original predictions on the surrogate
model. At test time, WNR combined with trained regenerator network is prepended
to the black box network, resulting in a high boost in adversarial accuracy.
Our method improves the adversarial accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 38.98% and 32.01%

uses surrogate architecture (Alexnet-half and Alexnet) similar to the black box

Existing methods that invert a nonsmooth estimator of the cumulative

distributions. We adopt a semiparametric conditional distribution regression
model that allows inference on any functionals of counterfactual distributions,

the data and ensure an efficient model, we adjust for a double balancing score

Bayesian estimation framework that appropriately propagates modeling
uncertainty. We show via simulations that the use of double balancing score for
confounding adjustment improves performance over adjusting for any single score
alone, and the proposed semiparametric model estimates QTEs more accurately

federated learning has become a topical area with cloud-based training
procedures when meeting data security. However, the distribution of IoMT has
the risk of protection from data poisoning attacks. Poisoned data can be
fabricated by falsifying medical data, which urges a security defense to IoMT
systems. Due to the lack of specific labels, the filtering of malicious data is
a unique unsupervised scenario. One of the main challenges is finding robust
data filtering methods for various poisoning attacks. This paper introduces a
Federated Data Sanitization Defense, a novel approach to protect the system
from data poisoning attacks. To solve this unsupervised problem, we first use
federated learning to project all the data to the subspace domain, allowing
unified feature mapping to be established since the data is stored locally.
Then we adopt the federated clustering to re-group their features to clarify
the poisoned data. The clustering is based on the consistent association of
data and its semantics. After we get the clustering of the private data, we do
the data sanitization with a simple yet efficient strategy. In the end, each
device of distributed ImOT is enabled to filter malicious data according to
federated data sanitization. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate
the efficacy of the proposed defense method against data poisoning attacks.
Further, we consider our approach in the different poisoning ratios and achieve
a high Accuracy and a low attack success rate.

been specifically designed to convert a stimulus into an electronic signal
using the wondrous principles of quantum mechanical tunneling. In the early
1990s, William Kaiser developed one of the first micromachined quantum
tunneling sensors as part of his work with the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Since then, there have been scattered attempts at utilizing this phenomenon for
the development of a variety of physical and chemical sensors. Although these
devices demonstrate unique characteristics such as high sensitivity, the
principle of quantum tunneling often acts as a double-edged sword and is
responsible for certain drawbacks of this sensor family. In this review, we
briefly explain the underlying working principles of quantum tunneling and how
they are used to design miniaturized quantum tunneling sensors. We then proceed
to describe an overview of the various attempts at developing such sensors.
Next, we discuss their current need and recent resurgence. Finally, we describe
various advantages and shortcomings of these sensors and end this review with
an insight into the potential of this technology and prospects.

Inspired by the cognitive decision-making process in humans, we enforce
high-level feature matching between the base class data and their corresponding
low-frequency samples in the pretraining stage via self distillation. The model
is then fine-tuned on the samples of novel classes where we additionally
improve the discriminability of low-frequency query set features via cosine
similarity. On a 1-shot setting of the CIFAR-FS dataset, our method yields a
massive improvement of $60.55\%$ & $62.05\%$ in adversarial accuracy on the PGD

the distortion of short-term features, we devised the convolution channel
separation technique that separates short-term features from long-term feature
extraction paths. To extract more diverse features from our framework, we
incorporated the frequency sub-bands aggregation method, which divides the
input spectrogram along frequency bandwidths and processes each segment. We
evaluated our framework using the Melon Playlist dataset which is a large-scale

Firstly, the UC solution is estimated to be an initial trial UC solution by a
fast method based on Lagrangian relaxation. This initial trial UC solution
fully considers the system-wide con-straints. Secondly, a dynamic programming
module is introduced to adjust the trial UC solution to make it satisfy the

feasibility-testing model and an updating strategy for the trial UC solution
are established in this part. Numerical tests are implemented on IEEE 24-bus,

Topological stability of knots is one of the many examples of their important
properties that can be used in information storage and transfer. Knot dynamics
is important for understanding general principles of entanglement as knots
provide an isolated system where tangles are highly controlled and easily
manipulated. To unravel the dynamics of these entangled topological objects,
the first step is to identify the dominant motions that are uniquely guided by
knot structure and its complexity. We identify and classify motions into three
main groups -- orthogonal, aligned, and mixed motions, which often act in
unison, orchestrating the complex dynamics of knots. The balance between these
motions is what creates an identifiable signature for every knot. As knot
complexity increases, the carefully orchestrated dynamics is gradually
silenced, eventually reaching a state of topologically driven dynamical arrest.
Depending on their complexity, knots undergo a transition from nearly
stochastic motions to either non-random or even quasiperiodic dynamics before
culminating in dynamical arrest. Here, we show for the first time that
connectivity alone can lead to a topology-driven dynamical arrest in knots of
high complexity. Unexpectedly, we noticed that some knots undergo cooperative
motions as they reach higher complexity, uniquely modulating conformational
patterns of a given knot. Together, these findings demonstrate a link between
topology and dynamics, presenting applications to nanoscale materials.

interchange symmetry $|U^{}_{\mu i}| = |U^{}_{\tau i}|$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) as
a good approximation. In particular, the T2K measurement implies that the
maximal neutrino mixing angle $\theta^{}_{23}$ and the CP-violating phase
$\delta$ should be close to $\pi/4$ and $-\pi/2$, respectively. Behind these
observations lies a minimal flavor symmetry -- - the effective Majorana
neutrino mass term keeps invariant under the transformations $\nu^{}_{e \rm L}

Firstly, the total Hamiltonian of the circuit is derived, and the dynamic
equation of the motion contributed is examined using the Heisenberg-Langevin
equation. Using the nonlinear Hamiltonian, some components are attached to the
intrinsic internal circuit of InP HEMT to fully address the circuit
characteristics. The components attached are arisen due to the nonlinearity
effects. As a result, the theoretical calculations show that the states
generated in the circuit are mixed, and no pure state is produced. Accordingly,
the modified circuit generates the two-mode squeezed thermal state, which means
one can focus on calculating the Gaussian quantum discord to evaluate quantum
correlation. It is also found that the nonlinearity factors (addressed as the
nonlinear components in the circuit) can intensely influence the squeezed
thermal state by which the quantum discord is changed. Finally, as the primary
point, it is concluded that although it is possible to enhance the quantum
correlation between modes by engineering the nonlinear components; however,
quantum discord greater than unity, entangled microwave photons, seems a
challenging task since InP HEMT operates at 4.2 K.

equipped with an intelligent controller which has access to different sensors
along the intersection to detect and predict the behavior of the traffic
participants involved. Since the intersection controller cannot directly
control all road users and - not least due to the legal situation - driving
decisions must always be made by the vehicle controller itself, we focus on a
decentralized control paradigm. In this context, connected and highly automated
vehicles use some carefully selected game theory concepts to make the best
possible and clear decisions about cooperative maneuvers. The aim is to improve
traffic efficiency while maintaining road safety at the same time. Our first
results obtained with a prototypical implementation of the approach in a
traffic simulation are promising.

question on how well they help identify the conflicts for the planner. In this
paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art predictors through novel conflict-related
metrics, such as the success rate of identifying conflicts. Surprisingly, the
predictors suffer from a low success rate and thus lead to a large percentage
of collisions when we test the prediction-planning system in an interactive

combines a physics-based trajectory generator and a learning-based relation

correlation with human judgments over traditional overlap-based methods.
Although PT-based methods have become the de facto standard for training
grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, GEC evaluation still does not
benefit from pretrained knowledge. This paper takes the first step towards
understanding and improving GEC evaluation with pretraining. We first find that
arbitrarily applying PT-based metrics to GEC evaluation brings unsatisfactory
correlation results because of the excessive attention to inessential systems
outputs (e.g., unchanged parts). To alleviate the limitation, we propose a
novel GEC evaluation metric to achieve the best of both worlds, namely PT-M2
which only uses PT-based metrics to score those corrected parts. Experimental
results on the CoNLL14 evaluation task show that PT-M2 significantly
outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art result of 0.949

the spontaneous generation of a magnetic field without the skin effect in a

category-level pose estimation into object size estimation, initial pose
estimation, and pose refinement. StereoPose then estimates object pose based on
representation in the normalized object coordinate space~(NOCS). To address the
issue of image content aliasing, we further define a back-view NOCS map for the
transparent object. The back-view NOCS aims to reduce the network learning
ambiguity caused by content aliasing, and leverage informative cues on the back
of the transparent object for more accurate pose estimation. To further improve
the performance of the stereo framework, StereoPose is equipped with a parallax
attention module for stereo feature fusion and an epipolar loss for improving
the stereo-view consistency of network predictions. Extensive experiments on

analytical and numerical analysis of these spectral observables for
non-Hermitian random matrices, and a careful unfolding, we find good agreement
with the nHSYK model for $q > 2$ starting at a timescale that decreases sharply
with $q$. The source of deviation from universality, identified analytically,
is ensemble fluctuations not related to the quantum dynamics. For fixed $q$ and
large enough $N$, these fluctuations become dominant up until after the
Heisenberg time, so that the spectral form factor is no longer useful for the
study of quantum chaos. In all cases, our results point to a weakened or
vanishing spectral rigidity that effectively delays the observation of full
quantum ergodicity. We also show that the number variance displays
nonstationary spectral correlations for both the nHSYK model and random
matrices. This nonstationarity, also not related to the quantum dynamics,
points to intrinsic limitations of these observables to describe the quantum
chaotic motion. On the other hand, we introduce the local spectral form factor,
which is shown to be stationary and not affected by collective fluctuations,
and propose it as an effective diagnostic of non-Hermitian quantum chaos. For
$q = 2$, we find saturation to Poisson statistics at a timescale of $\log D$,

hemisphere. For both the data sets, Cycle 19 shows maximum amplitude. For the
sunspot number time series, Cycle 24 was the weakest, and Cycle 15 for the
group area. The existence of double peaks and violation of the ``odd-even
rule'' was found in both data sets. We have studied the periodic and
quasi-periodic variations in both the time series by wavelet technique. We
noticed that along with the fundamental mode of the $\sim$ 11~year cycle and
polarity reversal period of 22~years, the sunspot activity data also exhibited
several mid-term periodicities in the opposite hemispheres, specifically the
Riger group and quasi-biennial periodicities. The temporal evolution of these
detected quasi-periodicities also differs in the northern and southern
hemispheres. We analyzed the data set statistically to understand the bulk
properties and coupling between the opposite hemispheres. The study indicates
that the two hemispheric data sets differ, but some dependency could be
present.

effective gravitational potential is then covariantly uplifted to a fully
relativistic metric in general relativity, describing the spacetime generated

When the desired group of participants come together and provide their shares,
the secret is obtained. For other combinations of shares, a garbage value is
returned. A threshold secret sharing scheme was proposed by Shamir and Blakley
independently. In this (n,t) threshold secret sharing scheme, the secret can be
obtained when at least t out of n participants contribute their shares. This

generalized ideal secret sharing. Unlike threshold secret sharing schemes, this
scheme reveals the secret only to the authorized sets of participants, not any

to implement various access priorities and access control mechanisms. A major
advantage of this scheme over the existing ones is that the shares being

establish a taxonomy, we organize the current physical attacks from attack
tasks, attack forms, and attack methods, respectively. Thus, readers can have a
systematic knowledge of this topic from different aspects. For the physical
defenses, we establish the taxonomy from pre-processing, in-processing, and
post-processing for the DNN models to achieve full coverage of the adversarial
defenses. Based on the above survey, we finally discuss the challenges of this
research field and further outlook on the future direction.

missions seeking to image the fine structure of astrophysical black holes. The
classical Lyapunov exponents of the corresponding nearly bound null geodesics
control the quasinormal ringing of a perturbed black hole as it settles back
down to equilibrium, and they admit a holographic interpretation in terms of
quantum Ruelle resonances of the microstate dual to the Kerr black hole. Recent
work has identified a number of emergent symmetries related to the intricate
self-similar structure of the photon ring. Here, we explore this web of
interrelated phenomena in an exactly soluble example that arises as an
approximation to the near-extremal Kerr black hole. The self-dual warped
AdS$_3$ geometry has a photon ring as well as $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$
isometries and an exactly calculable quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum. We show
explicitly that the geometric optics approximation reproduces the eikonal limit
of the exact QNM spectrum, as well as the approximate ""near-ring""
wavefunctions. The $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ isometries are directly related
to the emergent conformal symmetry of the photon ring in black hole images but
are distinct from a recently discussed conformal symmetry of the eikonal QNM
spectrum. The equivalence of the classical QNM spectrum -- and thus the photon
ring -- to the quantum Ruelle resonances in the context of a spacetime with a
putative holographic dual suggests that the photon ring of a warped black hole
is indeed part of the black hole hologram.

  Issue 2, Article 7","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/7",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) has been used widely in verification.
Its importance and popularity have only grown with the revival of temporal
logic synthesis, and with new uses of LTL in robotics and planning activities.
All these uses demand that the user have a clear understanding of what an LTL
specification means.
  Inquiry: Despite the growing use of LTL, no studies have investigated the
misconceptions users actually have in understanding LTL formulas. This paper
addresses the gap with a first study of LTL misconceptions. Approach: We study
researchers' and learners' understanding of LTL in four rounds (three written
surveys, one talk-aloud) spread across a two-year timeframe. Concretely, we
decompose ""understanding LTL"" into three questions. A person reading a spec
needs to understand what it is saying, so we study the mapping from LTL to
English. A person writing a spec needs to go in the other direction, so we
study English to LTL. However, misconceptions could arise from two sources: a
misunderstanding of LTL's syntax or of its underlying semantics. Therefore, we
also study the relationship between formulas and specific traces.
  Knowledge: We find several misconceptions that have consequences for
learners, tool builders, and designers of new property languages. These
findings are already resulting in changes to the Alloy modeling language. We
also find that the English to LTL direction was the most common source of
errors; unfortunately, this is the critical ""authoring"" direction in which a
subtle mistake can lead to a faulty system. We contribute study instruments
that are useful for training learners (whether academic or industrial) who are
getting acquainted with LTL, and we provide a code book to assist in the
analysis of responses to similar-style questions.
  Grounding: Our findings are grounded in the responses to our survey rounds.
Round 1 used Quizius to identify misconceptions among learners in a way that
reduces the threat of expert blind spots. Rounds 2 and 3 confirm that both
additional learners and researchers (who work in formal methods, robotics, and
related fields) make similar errors. Round 4 adds deep support for our
misconceptions via talk-aloud surveys.
  Importance This work provides useful answers to two critical but unexplored
questions: in what ways is LTL tricky and what can be done about it? Our survey
instruments can serve as a starting point for other studies.

  Issue 2, Article 4","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/4",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Generic programming, as defined by Stepanov, is a methodology for
writing efficient and reusable algorithms by considering only the required
properties of their underlying data types and operations. Generic programming
has proven to be an effective means of constructing libraries of reusable
software components in languages that support it. Generics-related language
design choices play a major role in how conducive generic programming is in
practice.
  Inquiry: Several mainstream programming languages (e.g. Java and C++) were
first created without generics; features to support generic programming were
added later, gradually. Much of the existing literature on supporting generic
programming focuses thus on retrofitting generic programming into existing
languages and identifying related implementation challenges. Is the programming
experience significantly better, or different when programming with a language
designed for generic programming without limitations from prior language design
choices?
  Approach: We examine Magnolia, a language designed to embody generic
programming. Magnolia is representative of an approach to language design
rooted in algebraic specifications. We repeat a well-known experiment, where we
put Magnolia's generic programming facilities under scrutiny by implementing a
subset of the Boost Graph Library, and reflect on our development experience.
  Knowledge: We discover that the idioms identified as key features for
supporting Stepanov-style generic programming in the previous studies and work
on the topic do not tell a full story. We clarify which of them are more of a
means to an end, rather than fundamental features for supporting generic
programming. Based on the development experience with Magnolia, we identify
variadics as an additional key feature for generic programming and point out
limitations and challenges of genericity by property.
  Grounding: Our work uses a well-known framework for evaluating the generic
programming facilities of a language from the literature to evaluate the
algebraic approach through Magnolia, and we draw comparisons with well-known
programming languages.
  Importance: This work gives a fresh perspective on generic programming, and
clarifies what are fundamental language properties and their trade-offs when
considering supporting Stepanov-style generic programming. The understanding of
how to set the ground for generic programming will inform future language
design.

  Issue 2, Article 5","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/5",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important kind of distributed
systems thanks to the wide-spread of cheap embedded devices equipped with
different networking technologies. Although ubiquitous, developing IoT systems
remains challenging.
  Inquiry: A recent field study with 194 IoT developers identifies debugging as
one of the main challenges faced when developing IoT systems. This comes from
the lack of debugging tools taking into account the unique properties of IoT
systems such as non-deterministic data, and hardware restricted devices. On the
one hand, offline debuggers allow developers to analyse post-failure recorded
program information, but impose too much overhead on the devices while
generating such information.
  Furthermore, the analysis process is also time-consuming and might miss
contextual information relevant to find the root cause of bugs. On the other
hand, online debuggers do allow debugging a program upon a failure while
providing contextual information (e.g., stack trace). In particular, remote
online debuggers enable debugging of devices without physical access to them.
However, they experience debugging interference due to network delays which
complicates bug reproducibility, and have limited support for dynamic software
updates on remote devices.
  Approach: This paper proposes out-of-things debugging, an online debugging
approach especially designed for IoT systems. The debugger is always-on as it
ensures constant availability to for instance debug post-deployment situations.
Upon a failure or breakpoint, out-of-things debugging moves the state of a
deployed application to the developer's machine. Developers can then debug the
application locally by applying operations (e.g., step commands) to the
retrieved state. Once debugging is finished, developers can commit bug fixes to
the device through live update capabilities. Finally, by means of a
fine-grained flexible interface for accessing remote resources, developers have
full control over the debugging overhead imposed on the device, and the access
to device hardware resources (e.g., sensors) needed during local debugging.
  Knowledge: Out-of-things debugging maintains good properties of remote
debugging as it does not require physical access to the device to debug it,
while reducing debugging interference since there are no network delays on
operations (e.g., stepping) issued on the debugger since those happen locally.
Furthermore, device resources are only accessed when requested by the user
which further mitigates overhead and opens avenues for mocking or simulation of
non-accessed resources.
  Grounding: We implemented an out-of-things debugger as an extension to a
WebAssembly Virtual Machine and benchmarked its suitability for IoT. In
particular, we compared our solution to remote debugging alternatives based on
metrics such as network overhead, memory usage, scalability, and usability in
production settings. From the benchmarks, we conclude that our debugger
exhibits competitive performance in addition to confining overhead without
sacrificing debugging convenience and flexibility.
  Importance: Out-of-things debugging enables debugging of IoT systems by means
of classical online operations (e.g., stepwise execution) while addressing
IoT-specific concerns (e.g., hardware limitations). We show that having the
debugger always-on does not have to come at cost of performance loss or
increased overhead but instead can enforce a smooth-going and flexible
debugging experience of IoT systems.

In such a microcavity, the LC molecular director can be electrically modulated

of vortices with topological charges of +1, +2, -2, and -1. The topological

the microcavity sample. This control is achieved by the interplay of a built-in

sources down to K~ 9 mag with SNR=1 on the DOT telescope. Angular diameters
larger than ~ 1 milliarcsecond (mas) could be measured with SNR above 10, or

continuous (nonlattice) Hermitian systems with an unbounded wave vector, it was
recently shown that the BEC of Chern insulators is modified. How would it be
further affected in non-Hermitian systems, experiencing loss and/or gain? In
this work, we take the first step in this direction, by studying a
bulk-Hermitian continuous system with non-Hermitian boundary conditions. We
find in this case that edge modes emerge at the roots of the scattering matrix,
as opposed to the Hermitian case, where they emerge at its poles (or, more
accurately, coalescence of roots and poles). This entails a nontrivial
modification to the relative Levinson's theorem. We then show that the
topological structure remains the same as in the Hermitian case, and the
generalized BEC holds, provided one employs appropriately modified contours in
the wave-vector plane so that the scattering matrix phase winding counts the
edge modes correctly. We exemplify all this using a paradigmatic model of waves
in a shallow ocean or active systems in the presence of odd viscosity, as well
as 2D electron gas with Hall viscosity. We use this opportunity to examine the
case of large odd viscosity, where the scattering matrix becomes $2\times2$,
which has not been discussed in previous works on the Hermitian generalized
BEC.

study how these advantages in quantum social welfare depend on the bias of the
game, and improve upon the separation that was previously obtained using
pseudo-telepathic strategies.
  Two different quantum settings are analysed: a first, in which players are
given direct access to an entangled quantum state, and a second, which we
introduce here, in which they are only given classical advice obtained from
quantum devices. For a given game $G$, these two settings give rise to
different equilibria characterised by the sets of equilibrium correlations
$Q_\textrm{corr}(G)$ and $Q(G)$, respectively. We show that $Q(G)\subseteq

SDP optimisation methods, provide indications of a strict separation between
the social welfare attainable in the two settings. This provides a new angle

of $18{\deg} \pm 5{\deg}$, roughly perpendicular to the radio jet. The
polarization of the ionized reflection is unconstrained. A comparison with
Monte Carlo simulations of the polarization expected from the torus shows that
the neutral reflector is consistent with being an equatorial torus with a
half-opening angle of 45{\deg}-55{\deg}. This is the first X-ray polarization
detection in a Seyfert galaxy, demonstrating the power of X-ray polarimetry in

optimization problem. It is known that its standard linear programming
relaxation is integral for bipartite graphs and half-integral for general
graphs. As a consequence, the natural rounding algorithm based on this
relaxation computes an optimal solution for bipartite graphs and a
$2$-approximation for general graphs. This raises the question of whether one
can obtain improved bounds on the approximation ratio, depending on how close
the graph is to being bipartite.
  In this paper, we consider a round-and-bipartize algorithm that exploits the
knowledge of an induced bipartite subgraph to attain improved approximation
ratios. Equivalently, we suppose that we have access to a subset of vertices
$S$ whose removal bipartizes the graph.
  If $S$ is an independent set, we prove an approximation ratio of $1 +
1/\rho$, where $2\rho -1$ denotes the odd girth of the contracted graph
$\tilde{\mathcal{G}} := \mathcal{G} /S$ and thus satisfies $\rho \geq 2$. We
show that this is tight for any graph and independent set by providing a family
of weight functions for which this bound is attained. In addition, we give
tight upper bounds for the fractional chromatic number and the integrality gap
of such graphs, both of which also depend on the odd girth.
  If $S$ is an arbitrary set, we prove a tight approximation ratio of
$\left(1+1/\rho \right) (1 - \alpha) + 2 \alpha$, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$
denotes the total normalized dual sum of the edges lying inside of the set $S$.
As an algorithmic application, we show that for any efficiently $k$-colorable
graph with $k \geq 4$ we can find a bipartizing set satisfying $\alpha \leq 1 -
4/k$. This provides an approximation algorithm recovering the bound of $2 -
2/k$ in the worst case (i.e., when $\rho = 2$), which is best possible for this
setting when using the standard relaxation.

hydrogen molecules in the undisturbed layer, nlay, and the (collective)
ionising output of the star(s), NdotLyC. The radius of the circular hole is

rate at which molecular gas is swept up into a dense ring by the shock front

ring. We suggest that our model might be a useful zeroth-order representation
of many observed HIIRs. From viewing directions close to the midplane of the

normal to the layer it will appear to be a limb-brightened shell but too faint

find that the rearrangement decays of the tetraquarks may be mainly driven by
the spin-spin interactions. The resonances $X_0(2900)^0$ and
$T^a_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++/0}$ reported from LHCb may be assigned to be the
lowest $1S$-wave tetraquark states $\bar{T}_{cs0}^f(2818)$ and
$T^{a}_{c\bar{s}0}(2828)$ classified in the quark model, respectively. It also
allows us to extract the couplings for the initial tetraquark states to their
nearby $S$-wave interaction channels. We find that some of these couplings turn
out to be sizeable. Following the picture of the wavefunction renormalization
for the near-threshold strong $S$-wave interactions, the sizeable coupling
strengths can be regarded as an indication of their dynamic origins as
candidates for hadronic molecules. Furthermore, our predictions suggest that

(DNN) inference workloads in cloud datacenters. To fully utilize GPU resources,
spatial sharing of GPUs among co-located DNN inference workloads becomes
increasingly compelling. However, GPU sharing inevitably brings severe
performance interference among co-located inference workloads, as motivated by
an empirical measurement study of DNN inference on EC2 GPU instances. While
existing works on guaranteeing inference performance service level objectives
(SLOs) focus on either temporal sharing of GPUs or reactive GPU resource
scaling and inference migration techniques, how to proactively mitigate such
severe performance interference has received comparatively little attention. In
this paper, we propose iGniter, an interference-aware GPU resource provisioning
framework for cost-efficiently achieving predictable DNN inference in the
cloud. iGniter is comprised of two key components: (1) a lightweight DNN
inference performance model, which leverages the system and workload metrics
that are practically accessible to capture the performance interference; (2) A
cost-efficient GPU resource provisioning strategy that jointly optimizes the
GPU resource allocation and adaptive batching based on our inference
performance model, with the aim of achieving predictable performance of DNN
inference workloads. We implement a prototype of iGniter based on the NVIDIA
Triton inference server hosted on EC2 GPU instances. Extensive prototype
experiments on four representative DNN models and datasets demonstrate that
iGniter can guarantee the performance SLOs of DNN inference workloads with
practically acceptable runtime overhead, while saving the monetary cost by up
to 25% in comparison to the state-of-the-art GPU resource provisioning
strategies.

an exactly quantised topological charge $Q=-1$. In the presence of an
oscillating magnetic field ${\bf B}_1(t)$, a single skyrmion embedded in a
ferromagnetic background will start to move with constant velocity ${\bf
v}_{\text{trans}}$. The mechanism behind this motion is similar to the one used
by a jellyfish when it swims through water. We show that the skyrmion's motion
is a universal phenomenon, arising in any magnetic system with translational
modes. By projecting the equation of motion onto the skyrmion's translational
modes and going to quadratic order in ${\bf B}_1(t)$ we obtain an analytical
expression for ${\bf v}_{\text{trans}}$ as a function of the system's linear
response. The linear response and consequently ${\bf v}_{\text{trans}}$ are
influenced by the skyrmion's internal modes and scattering states, as well as
by the ferromagnetic background's Kittel mode. The direction and speed of ${\bf
v}_{\text{trans}}$ can be controlled by changing the polarisation, frequency
and phase of the driving field ${\bf B}_1(t)$. For systems with small Gilbert
damping parameter $\alpha$, we identify two distinct physical mechanisms used
by the skyrmion to move. At low driving frequencies, the skyrmion's motion is
driven by friction, and $v_{\text{trans}}\sim\alpha$, whereas at higher
frequencies above the ferromagnetic gap the skyrmion moves by magnon emission
and $v_{\text{trans}}$ becomes independent of $\alpha$.

However, the acoustic data is affected by industrial disturbing noise.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the robustness of features

dataset with typical faults and acoustic disturbances is recorded by an
acoustic array. This includes industrial noise from the production and
systematically produced disturbances, used to compare the robustness. Overall,
it is proposed to apply features extracted from a log-envelope spectrum
together with psychoacoustic features. The anomaly de-tection is done by using
the isolation forest or the more universal bagging random miner. Most
disturbances can be circumvented, while the use of a hammer or air pressure
often causes problems. In general, these results are important for condi-tion

this problem: 1) how to handle the huge search space of potential hyperedges,

the signals observed on nodes and the hypergraph structure. In this paper, for
the first challenge, we adopt the assumption that the ideal hypergraph

pairwise relations within signals. Further, we propose a hypergraph structure
learning framework HGSL with a novel dual smoothness prior that reveals a
mapping between the observed node signals and the hypergraph structure, whereby
each hyperedge corresponds to a subgraph with both node signal smoothness and
edge signal smoothness in the learnable graph structure. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate HGSL on both synthetic and real world
datasets. Experiments show that HGSL can efficiently infer meaningful
hypergraph topologies from observed signals.

balancing, attack detection and mitigation, and traffic engineering. A key
building block in many critical measurement tasks is \emph{q-MAX}, where we
wish to find the largest $q$ values in a number stream. A standard approach of
maintaining a heap of the largest $q$ values ordered results in logarithmic
runtime, which is too slow for large measurements. Modern approaches attain a
constant runtime by removing small items in bulk and retaining the largest $q$
items at all times. Yet, these approaches are bottlenecked by an expensive
quantile calculation method.
  We propose SQUID, a method that redesigns q-MAX to allow the use of
\emph{approximate quantiles}, which we can compute efficiently, thereby
accelerating the solution and, subsequently, many measurement tasks. We
demonstrate the benefit of our approach by designing a novel weighted heavy
hitters data structure that is faster and more accurate than the existing
alternatives. Here, we combine our previous techniques with a lazy deletion of
small entries, which expiates the maintenance process and increases the
accuracy. We also demonstrate the applicability of our algorithmic approach in
a general algorithmic scope by implementing the LRFU cache policy with a
constant update time. Furthermore, we also show the practicality of SQUID for
improving real-world networked systems, by implementing a P4 prototype of SQUID
for in-network caching and demonstrating how SQUID enables a wide spectrum of
score-based caching policies directly on a P4 switch.

Firstly, we determine the rank by imposing the Multiplicative Gamma Prior to

the curvature perturbation field. For the first time, we include NG going
beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations, and consider a
completely generic functional form. Adopting threshold statistics of the
compaction function, we address the computation of the abundance both for
narrow and broad power spectra. While our formulas are generic, we discuss
explicit examples of phenomenological relevance considering the physics case of
the curvaton field. We carefully assess under which conditions the conventional
perturbative approach can be trusted. In the case of a narrow power spectrum,
this happens only if the perturbative expansion is pushed beyond the quadratic
order (with the optimal order of truncation that depends on the width of the
spectrum). Most importantly, we demonstrate that the perturbative approach is
intrinsically flawed when considering broad spectra, in which case only the
non-perturbative computation captures the correct result. Finally, we describe
the phenomenological relevance of our results for the connection between the
abundance of PBHs and the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background related
to their formation. As NGs modify the amplitude of perturbations necessary to
produce a given PBHs abundance and boost PBHs production at large scales for
broad spectra, modelling these effects is crucial to connect the PBH scenario
to its signatures at current and future GWs experiments.

(TLE) and a one dimensional (1D) dimer chain of coupled resonators with the
alternate single-photon energies. In the single-excitation subspace, this
system not only possesses two energy bands with propagating states, but also
possesses chiral bound states. The number of chiral bound states depends on the
coupling forms between the TLE and the dimer chain. It is found that when the
TLE is locally coupled to one resonator of the dimer chain, the bound-state
that has mirror reflection symmetry is not a chiral one. When the TLE is
nonlocally coupled to two adjacent resonators, three chiral bound states arise
due to the mirror symmetry breaking. The chirality of these bound states can be
tuned by changing the energy differences of single photon in the adjacent
resonators, the coupling strengths and the transition energy of the TLE. The
chirality behaviour of the ordinary two bound states outside the energy bands
is quite different from the one of the emerging bound state inside the energy
gap. The almost perfect chiral bound states can be achieved at certain

investigations in many bands of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. A high
gamma-ray state from the blazar was revealed soon after the event and in a
follow-up to about 40 days. A posteriori observations also in the optical and
radio bands indicated a rise of the flux from the TXS 0506+056 blazar. A
previous excess of events of the duration of more than 100~d was observed by

the system potential. In condensed-matter systems disorder is typically divided
into two types; those with local parameters varying from site to site (diagonal
disorder) and those characterized by random transfer-integral values
(off-diagonal disorder). Amorphous systems in particular exhibit off-diagonal
disorder due to random positions of their constituents. In real systems
diagonal and off-diagonal disorder may be interconnected. The formal depiction
of disorder as local deviations from a common value focuses attention on the
short-range components of the potential-landscape. However, long range

find a correlation between disorder and homogeneity using amorphous

its amorphous structure and chemical composition is preserved. The reduced

that can alter the transparency of the visual feedback: the lag between the
motion of the operator's and robot's head due to network communication delays
or slow robot joint motion. This latency could cause a noticeable delay in the
visual feedback, which jeopardizes the embodiment quality, can cause dizziness,
and affects the interactivity resulting in operator frequent motion pauses for
the visual feedback to settle; (ii) the mismatch between the camera's and the
headset's field-of-views (FOV), the former having generally a lower FOV; and
(iii) a mismatch between human's and robot's range of motions of the neck, the
latter being also generally lower. In order to leverage these drawbacks, we
developed a decoupled viewpoint control solution for a humanoid platform which
allows visual feedback with low-latency and artificially increases the camera's
FOV range to match that of the operator's headset. Our novel solution uses SLAM
technology to enhance the visual feedback from a reconstructed mesh,
complementing the areas that are not covered by the visual feedback from the
robot. The visual feedback is presented as a point cloud in real-time to the
operator. As a result, the operator is fed with real-time vision from the
robot's head orientation by observing the pose of the point cloud. Balancing
this kind of awareness and immersion is important in virtual reality based
teleoperation, considering the safety and robustness of the control system. An
experiment shows the effectiveness of our solution.

paper, we aim to characterize the relationship between smartphone and smart TV
apps. To fill this gap, we conduct a comparative study on smartphone and smart
TV apps in this work, which is the starting and fundamental step to uncover the
domain-specific challenges. Method: We gather a large-scale phone/TV app pairs
from Google Play Store. We then analyzed the app pairs quantitatively and
qualitatively from a variety of perspectives, including non-code (e.g.,
metadata, resources, permissions, etc.), code (e.g., components, methods, user
interactions, etc.), security and privacy (e.g., reports of AndroBugs and
FlowDroid). Results: Our experimental results indicate that (1) the code of the
smartphone and TV apps can be released in the same app package or in separate
app packages with the same package name; (2) 43% of resource files and 50% of
code methods are reused between phone/TV app pairs; (3) TV and phone versions
of the same app often encounter different kinds of security vulnerabilities;
and (4) TV apps encounter fewer user interactions than their phone versions,
but the type of user interaction events, surprisingly, are similar between
phone/TV apps. Conclution: Our findings are valuable for developers and
academics in comprehending the TV app ecosystem by providing additional insight
into the migration of phone apps to TVs and the design mechanism of analysis

Self-supervised pre-trained representations can robustly capture information

information across time need to be considered as the relevant emotion
information is likely to appear piecewise and not uniformly across the signal.
For the labels, we need to take into account that there is a substantial degree
of noise that comes from the subjective human annotations. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to attentive pooling based on correlations between the
representations' coefficients combined with label smoothing, a method aiming to
reduce the confidence of the classifier on the training labels. We evaluate our

heavy quantum impurity immersed in Fermi gases and manipulated with
radio-frequency pulses. FDA has been successfully applied to investigate the
universal dynamical responses of a heavy impurity in an ultracold ideal Fermi
gas in both the time and frequency domain, which allows the exploration of the
renowned Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC). In such a system, OC is
induced by the multiple particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, which is
beyond a simple perturbation picture and manifests itself as the absence of
quasiparticles named polarons. More recently, two new directions for studying
heavy impurity with FDA have been developed. One is to extend FDA to a strongly
correlated background superfluid background, a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
superfluid. In this system, Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe is prohibited
due to the suppression of multiple particle-hole excitations by the superfluid
gap, which leads to the existence of genuine polaron. The other direction is to
generalize the FDA to the case of multiple RF pulses scheme, which extends the
well-established 1D Ramsey spectroscopy in ultracold atoms into
multidimensional, in the same spirit as the well-known multidimensional nuclear
magnetic resonance and optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy.
Multidimensional Ramsey spectroscopy allows us to investigate correlations
between spectral peaks of an impurity-medium system that is not accessible in

classical sense, while it admits a polynomial solution in quantum computing. It
is about a function $f$ for which it is given that a unique non-zero vector $s$
exists for which $f(x) = f(x \oplus s)$ for all $x$, where $\oplus$ is the
exclusive or operator. The goal is to find $s$. The exponential lower bound for

paper we investigate classical complexity when $f$ is given by a standard
representation like a circuit. We focus on finding the vector space of all
vectors $s$ for which $f(x) = f(x \oplus s)$ for all $x$, for any given $f$.
Two main results are: (1) if $f$ is given by any circuit, then checking whether
this vector space contains a non-zero element is NP-hard, and (2) if $f$ is
given by any ordered BDD, then a basis of this vector space can be computed in

interest, such as humans, it is essential to acquire large-scale UAV-based
datasets that include human instances with various poses captured from widely
varying viewing angles. As a viable alternative to laborious and costly data
curation, we introduce Progressive Transformation Learning (PTL), which
gradually augments a training dataset by adding transformed virtual images with
enhanced realism. Generally, a virtual2real transformation generator in the
conditional GAN framework suffers from quality degradation when a large domain
gap exists between real and virtual images. To deal with the domain gap, PTL
takes a novel approach that progressively iterates the following three steps:
1) select a subset from a pool of virtual images according to the domain gap,
2) transform the selected virtual images to enhance realism, and 3) add the
transformed virtual images to the training set while removing them from the
pool. In PTL, accurately quantifying the domain gap is critical. To do that, we
theoretically demonstrate that the feature representation space of a given
object detector can be modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution from
which the Mahalanobis distance between a virtual object and the Gaussian
distribution of each object category in the representation space can be readily
computed. Experiments show that PTL results in a substantial performance
increase over the baseline, especially in the small data and the cross-domain
regime.

(3) CAB is composed of 1D convolution and fully connected layers to perform a

modeling (MIM) has been proven very effective. However, customized algorithms
should be carefully designed for the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., GreenMIM, instead
of using the vanilla and simple MAE for the plain ViT. More importantly, since
these hierarchical ViTs cannot reuse the off-the-shelf pre-trained weights of
the plain ViTs, the requirement of pre-training them leads to a massive amount
of computational cost, thereby incurring both algorithmic and computational
complexity. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel idea of
disentangling the hierarchical architecture design from the self-supervised
pre-training. We transform the plain ViT into a hierarchical one with minimal
changes. Technically, we change the stride of linear embedding layer from 16 to
4 and add convolution (or simple average) pooling layers between the
transformer blocks, thereby reducing the feature size from 1/4 to 1/32
sequentially. Despite its simplicity, it outperforms the plain ViT baseline in

relational triples from a stereoscopic perspective, either learning a
relation-specific tagger or separate classifiers for each relation type.
However, they still suffer from error propagation, relation redundancy and lack
of high-level connections between triples. To address these issues, we propose
a novel query-based approach to construct instance-level representations for
relational triples. By metric-based comparison between query embeddings and
token embeddings, we can extract all types of triples in one step, thus
eliminating the error propagation problem. In addition, we learn the
instance-level representation of relational triples via contrastive learning.
In this way, relational triples can not only enclose rich class-level semantics
but also access to high-order global connections. Experimental results show
that our proposed method achieves the state of the art on five widely used
benchmarks.

  Guarantee",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the prevalence of ``price protection guarantee"", which allows a
customer who purchased a product in the past to receive a refund from the
seller during the so-called price protection period (typically defined as a
certain time window after the purchase date) in case the seller decides to
lower the price, we study the impact of such policy on the design of online
learning algorithm for data-driven dynamic pricing with initially unknown
customer demand. We consider a setting where a firm sells a product over a
horizon of $T$ time steps. For this setting, we characterize how the value of
$M$, the length of price protection period, can affect the optimal regret of
the learning process. We show that the optimal regret is
$\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T}+\min\{M,\,T^{2/3}\})$ by first establishing a
fundamental impossible regime with novel regret lower bound instances. Then, we
propose LEAP, a phased exploration type algorithm for \underline{L}earning and
\underline{EA}rning under \underline{P}rice Protection to match this lower
bound up to logarithmic factors or even doubly logarithmic factors (when there
are only two prices available to the seller). Our results reveal the surprising
phase transitions of the optimal regret with respect to $M$. Specifically, when
$M$ is not too large, the optimal regret has no major difference when compared
to that of the classic setting with no price protection guarantee. We also show
that there exists an upper limit on how much the optimal regret can deteriorate
when $M$ grows large. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to
show the benefit of LEAP over other heuristic methods for this problem.

the Hypatia and GALAH catalogues. We apply a devolatilization model to simulate
compositions of hypothetical, terrestrial-type exoplanets in the habitable
zones around Sun-like stars, considering elements O, S, Na, Si, Mg, Fe, Ni, Ca,
and Al. We further apply core-mantle differentiation by assuming constant
oxygen fugacity, and model the consequent mantle mineralogy with a Gibbs energy
minimisation algorithm. We report statistics on several compositional
parameters and propose a reference set of (21) representative planet
compositions for using as end-member compositions in imminent modelling and
experimental studies. We find a strong correlation between stellar Fe/Mg and
metallic core sizes, which can vary from 18 to 35 wt%. Furthermore, stellar
Mg/Si gives a first-order indication of mantle mineralogy, with high-Mg/Si
stars leading to weaker, ferropericlase-rich mantles, and low-Mg/Si stars
leading to mechanically stronger mantles. The element Na, which modulates
crustal buoyancy and mantle clinopyroxene fraction, is affected by
devolatilization the most. While we find that planetary mantles mostly consist
of Fe/Mg-silicates, core sizes and relative abundances of common minerals can
nevertheless vary significantly among exoplanets. These differences likely lead
to different evolutionary pathways among rocky exoplanets in the solar

Based on the geometric Wasserstein tangent
space, we first introduce Wasserstein steepest descent flows. These are locally
absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein space whose tangent vectors
point into a steepest descent direction of a given functional. This allows the
use of Euler forward schemes instead of minimizing movement schemes introduced
by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto. For locally Lipschitz continuous functionals
which are $\lambda$-convex along generalized geodesics, we show that there
exists a unique Wasserstein steepest descent flow which coincides with the
Wasserstein gradient flow.
  The second aim is to study Wasserstein flows of the maximum mean discrepancy
with respect to certain Riesz kernels. The crucial part is hereby the treatment
of the interaction energy. Although it is not $\lambda$-convex along
generalized geodesics, we give analytic expressions for Wasserstein steepest
descent flows of the interaction energy starting at Dirac measures. In contrast
to smooth kernels, the particle may explode, i.e., a Dirac measure becomes a
non-Dirac one. The computation of steepest descent flows amounts to finding
equilibrium measures with external fields, which nicely links Wasserstein flows
of interaction energies with potential theory. Finally, we provide numerical
simulations of Wasserstein steepest descent flows of discrepancies.

suggesting that pure MnPt$_5$P is close to an instability. Once x $>$ 0.010,

localize at the left or the right chain-atom coupling sites in weak
localization regimes. This bipolar localization leads to Bloch-like states,

localization is obviously weaker than the case with two small atoms or open

complete sample of galaxies in a rich environment. The extraordinary
sensitivity of the data allows us to sample the whole dynamic range of the
Halpha luminosity function, from massive (M*~10^11 Mo) to dwarf systems
(M*~10^6 Mo). This extends previous works to a dynamic range in stellar mass
and star formation rate (10^-4<SFR<10 Mo yr^-1) never explored so far. The main
sequence (MS) relation derived for all star forming galaxies within one virial
radius of the Virgo cluster has a slope comparable to that observed in other
nearby samples of isolated objects, but has a dispersion ~3 times larger. The
dispersion is tightly connected to the available amount of HI gas, with
gas-poor systems located far below objects of similar stellar mass but with a
normal HI content. When measured on unperturbed galaxies with a normal HI gas
content, the relation has a slope a=0.92, an intercept b=-1.57, and a scatter
~0.40. We compare these observational results to the prediction of models. The
observed scatter in the MS relation can be reproduced only after a violent and
active stripping process such as ram-pressure that removes gas from the disc
and quenches star formation on short (<1 Gyr) timescales. This rules out milder
processes such as starvation. This interpretation is also consistent with the
position of galaxies of different star formation activity and gas content
within the phase-space diagram. We also show that the star forming regions
formed in the stripped material outside perturbed galaxies are located well
above the MS relation drawn by unperturbed systems. These HII regions, which
might be at the origin of compact sources typical in rich environments, are
living a starburst phase lasting only <50 Myr, later becoming quiescent
systems.

hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising tasks, whose typical ways include
model-based methods and data-based methods. The model-based methods have good
generalization ability, while the runtime cannot meet the fast processing
requirements of the practical situations due to the large size of an HSI data $
\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{MN\times B}$. For the data-based methods, they
perform very fast on new test data once they have been trained. However, their
generalization ability is always insufficient. In this paper, we propose a fast
model-based HSI denoising approach. Specifically, we propose a novel
regularizer named Representative Coefficient Total Variation (RCTV) to
simultaneously characterize the low rank and local smooth properties. The RCTV
regularizer is proposed based on the observation that the representative
coefficient matrix $\mathbf{U}\in\mathbb{R}^{MN\times R} (R\ll B)$ obtained by
orthogonally transforming the original HSI $\mathbf{X}$ can inherit the strong
local-smooth prior of $\mathbf{X}$. Since $R/B$ is very small, the HSI
denoising model based on the RCTV regularizer has lower time complexity.
Additionally, we find that the representative coefficient matrix $\mathbf{U}$
is robust to noise, and thus the RCTV regularizer can somewhat promote the
robustness of the HSI denoising model. Extensive experiments on mixed noise
removal demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method both in denoising
performance and denoising speed compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
Remarkably, the denoising speed of our proposed method outperforms all the
model-based techniques and is comparable with the deep learning-based
approaches.

when this occurs, and then use what we learned to show that every epic lens is

combinator that formalizes the directional derivative from multivariable
calculus. Cartesian differential categories provide a categorical semantics of
the differential lambda-calculus and have also found applications in causal
computation, incremental computation, game theory, differentiable programming,
and machine learning. There has recently been a desire to provide a
(coordinate-free) characterization of Jacobians and gradients in Cartesian
differential categories. One's first attempt might be to consider Cartesian
differential categories which are Cartesian closed, such as models of the
differential lambda-calculus, and then take the curry of the derivative.
Unfortunately, this approach excludes numerous important examples of Cartesian
differential categories such as the category of real smooth functions. In this
paper, we introduce linearly closed Cartesian differential categories, which
are Cartesian differential categories that have an internal hom of linear maps,
a bilinear evaluation map, and the ability to curry maps which are linear in
their second argument. As such, the Jacobian of a map is defined as the curry
of its derivative. Many well-known examples of Cartesian differential
categories are linearly closed, such as, in particular, the category of real
smooth functions. We also explain how a Cartesian closed differential category
is linearly closed if and only if a certain linear idempotent on the internal
hom splits. To define the gradient of a map, one must be able to define the
transpose of the Jacobian, which can be done in a Cartesian reverse
differential category. Thus, we define the gradient of a map to be the curry of
its reverse derivative and show this equals the transpose of its Jacobian. We
also explain how a linearly closed Cartesian reverse differential category is
precisely a linearly closed Cartesian differential category with an appropriate
notion of transpose.

observational diagnostic for the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) effects.
The expected spectra characteristics are applied to a GRB 221009A. The results
show that the cosmic opacity with LIV effects considered here {can} roughly
reproduce the observed $\gamma$-ray spectra for the source, which enabled us to

OM serves as a pre-quantum algebra from which algebraic structures relevant to
real-world classical and quantum mechanics follow. In particular, $\psi_{KvN}$
and $\psi_{QM}$ are both consequences of this pre-quantum formalism. No a
priori Hilbert space is needed. OM admits an algebraic notion of operator
expectation values without invoking states. A phase space bundle ${\cal E}$
follows from this. $\psi_{KvN}$ and $\psi_{QM}$ are shown to be sections in

a quantization map interpreted as ""twisting"" of sections over ${\cal E}$. We

both originate from a pre-quantum operator algebra. Finally, we comment on how

the free algebra for the signature in a category of complete partial orders

uninterpreted side-effects. In particular, the operational flavor of game
semantics carries over to the algebraic context, in the form of the coincidence
between the initial algebras and the terminal coalgebras of cpo endofunctors.
  Conversely, the algebraic point of view sheds new light on the strategy
constructions underlying game semantics. Strategy models can be reformulated as
ideal completions of partial strategy trees (free dcpos on the term algebra).
Extending the framework to multi-sorted signatures would make this construction

dissipative losses are analyzed in the frequency domains. The dipole produces
radiation in bursts of duration T/2 where T is the period of oscillation. The
parameter studied in this paper is the energy, U, dissipated in a single burst
of radiation of duration T/2. We have studied how U vary as a function of the
charge associated with the current in the dipole and the ratio of the length of
the dipole and its radius. We have observed a remarkable result when this ratio
is equal to the ratio of the radius of the universe to the Bohr radius. Our
results, based purely on the classical electrodynamics and general relativity,
show that, as the magnitude of the oscillating charge (as defined by the root
mean square) reduces to the electronic charge, the energy dissipated in a
single burst of radiation reduces to hv, where v is the frequency of
oscillation and h is the Planck constant. The importance of this finding is
discussed. In particular, the results show that the existence of a minimum free
charge in nature, i.e., electronic charge, is a direct consequence of the
photonic nature of the electromagnetic fields. Furthermore, the presented
findings allow to derive for the first time an expression for the vacuum energy
density of the universe in terms of the other fundamental constants in nature,
the prediction of which is consistent with experimental observations. This
equation, which combines the vacuum energy, electronic charge and mass, speed
of light, gravitational constant and Planck constant, creates a link between
classical field theories (i.e., classical electrodynamics and general

challenging problem by providing an effective hyperparameter tuning framework
with differential privacy. The proposed method allows us to adopt a broader
hyperparameter search space and even to perform a grid search over the whole

hyperparameter candidates. Interestingly, it instead correlates with the
utility gained from hyperparameter searching, revealing an explicit and
mandatory trade-off between privacy and utility. Theoretically, we show that
its additional privacy loss bound incurred by hyperparameter tuning is
upper-bounded by the squared root of the gained utility. However, we note that
the additional privacy loss bound would empirically scale like a squared root

expensive numerical modelling, which is often inefficient to adapt to new
simulation parameters. This limits their use in simulating dynamic human
behaviours, which typically proceed along a sequence of small time steps. One
may painstakingly produce a few static simulations at discretised stages, but
not the hundreds of simulations that are essential to capture the dynamic

conditional generative models, which can learn complex relationships between
the underlying generative conditions and the output data whilst remaining
inexpensive to sample from. As a demonstration of this concept, we present
BioMime, a hybrid-structured generative model that combines elements of deep
latent variable models and conditional adversarial training. We demonstrate
that BioMime can learn to accurately mimic a complex numerical model of human
muscle biophysics and then use this knowledge to continuously sample from a
dynamically changing system in a short time. This ultimately converts a static
model into a dynamic one with no effort. We argue that transfer learning
approaches with conditional generative models are a viable solution for dynamic

nonlinearity of the encoder is the critical ingredient towards this end, we

stability on the formation and properties of DWD populations. We performed a
series of binary population synthesis, where the critical mass ratios from
adiabatic mass loss model (Ge's model) and that from the composite polytropic
model are adopted, respectively. For Ge's model, most of the DWDs are produced
from the stable non-conservative Roche lobe overflow plus common envelope (CE)
ejection channel (RL+CE channel) regardless of the CE ejection efficiency
$\alpha_{CE}$. While the results of the polytropic model strongly depend on the
adopted value of $\alpha_{ CE}$. We find DWDs produced from the RL+CE channel
have comparable WD masses and the mass ratio distribution peaks at around 1.
Based on the magnitude-limited sample of DWDs, the space densities for the
detectable DWDs and those with extremely low-mass WD (ELM WD) companions in
Ge's model is $1347$ and $473 kpc^{-3}$, respectively, close to observations.
While the polytropic model overpredicts space density of DWDs by a factor of
about $2-3$. We also find that the results of DWD merger rate distribution in
Ge's model reproduce the observations better than that of the polytropic model,
and the merger rate of DWDs with ELM WD companions in the Galaxy is about
$1.8\times 10^{-3} yr^{-1}$ in Ge's model, which is comparable to the
observation estimation. We confirm that the mass transfer stability plays
important roles in the formation and properties of DWD populations, and then in
the progenitors of SNe Ia and detectable GW sources.

that high rates of cell death relative to efferocytic uptake results in a

potentially slow or halt plaque growth by allowing material to exit the plaque,
but this is contingent on the availability of live macrophage foam cells in the

combining smooth local transitions and abrupt resetting events to a set of
reference values. The inclusion of the resetting mechanism not only provides
the possibility of modeling a wide variety of realistic systems but also leads
to interesting novel phenomenology not present in reset-free cases. However,
most models where stochastic resetting is studied address the case of a finite
number of uncorrelated variables, commonly a single one, such as the position
of non-interacting random walkers. Here we overcome this limitation by framing
the process of network growth with node deletion as a stochastic resetting
problem where an arbitrarily large number of degrees of freedom are coupled and
influence each other, both in the resetting and non-resetting (growth) events.
We find the exact, full-time solution of the model, and several
out-of-equilibrium properties are characterized as function of the growth and
resetting rates, such as the emergence of a time-dependent percolation-like
phase transition, and first-passage statistics. Coupled multiparticle systems
subjected to resetting are a necessary generalization in the theory of
stochastic resetting, and the model presented herein serves as an illustrative,
natural and solvable example of such a generalization.

modalities to mitigate data degradation and provide a measure of robustness
when operating in adverse conditions. Radars and cameras are a popular sensor
combination -- although radar measurements are sparse in comparison to camera
images, radar scans are able to penetrate fog, rain, and snow. Data from both
sensors are typically fused prior to use in downstream perception tasks.
However, accurate sensor fusion depends upon knowledge of the spatial transform
between the sensors and any temporal misalignment that exists in their
measurement times. During the life cycle of an AV, these calibration parameters
may change. The ability to perform in-situ spatiotemporal calibration is
essential to ensure reliable long-term operation. State-of-the-art 3D
radar-camera spatiotemporal calibration algorithms require bespoke calibration
targets that are not readily available in the field. In this paper, we describe
an algorithm for targetless spatiotemporal calibration that is able to operate
without specialized infrastructure. Our approach leverages the ability of the
radar unit to measure its own ego-velocity relative to a fixed external
reference frame. We analyze the identifiability of the spatiotemporal
calibration problem and determine the motions necessary for calibration.
Through a series of simulation studies, we characterize the sensitivity of our
algorithm to measurement noise. Finally, we demonstrate accurate calibration
for three real-world systems, including a handheld sensor rig and a
vehicle-mounted sensor array. Our results show that we are able to match the
performance of an existing, target-based method, while calibrating in arbitrary

  Models",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. A backdoor DNN model behaves normally with clean inputs,
whereas outputs attacker's expected behaviors when the inputs contain a
pre-defined pattern called a trigger. However, in some tasks, the attacker
cannot know the exact target that shows his/her expected behavior, because the
task may contain a large number of classes and the attacker does not have full
access to know the semantic details of these classes. Thus, the attacker is
willing to attack multiple suspected targets to achieve his/her purpose. In
light of this, in this paper, we propose the M-to-N backdoor attack, a new
attack paradigm that allows an attacker to launch a fuzzy attack by
simultaneously attacking N suspected targets, and each of the N targets can be
activated by any one of its M triggers. To achieve a better stealthiness, we
randomly select M clean images from the training dataset as our triggers for
each target. Since the triggers used in our attack have the same distribution
as the clean images, the inputs poisoned by the triggers are difficult to be
detected by the input-based defenses, and the backdoor models trained on the
poisoned training dataset are also difficult to be detected by the model-based
defenses. Thus, our attack is stealthier and has a higher probability of
achieving the attack purpose by attacking multiple suspected targets
simultaneously in contrast to prior backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments
show that our attack is effective against different datasets with various
models and achieves high attack success rates (e.g., 99.43% for attacking 2
targets and 98.23% for attacking 4 targets on the CIFAR-10 dataset) when
poisoning only an extremely small portion of the training dataset (e.g., less
than 2%). Besides, it is robust to pre-processing operations and can resist
state-of-the-art defenses.

form for the so-called complex-orbital basis. Characteristically, with respect
to this basis, the model has two hopping channels, one that is orbital-flavor
conserving, and a second one that is orbital-flavor non-conserving. We show
that the noninteracting electronic structure consists of two nondegenerate
bands of plane-wave real-orbital single-particle states for which the orbital
depends on the wave vector. Due to the latter feature each band is unpolarized
at any filling, and has a non-Gaussian density of states at $d=\infty$. The

systems with a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom. Our main points of
interest are the relations between the timescales of thermalization and the
timescales of chaotization; the choice of appropriate observables and the
structure of equations coupling them; identifying the classes of weakly
nonintegrable dynamics and developing tools to diagnose the properties specific
to such classes. We discuss the traditional in the field methods for
thermalization timescale computation and employ them to study the scaling the
timescale with the proximity to the integrable limit. We then elaborate on a
novel framework based on the full Lyapunov spectra computation for large
systems as a powerful tool for the characterization of weak nonintegrability.
In particular, the Lyapunov spectrum scaling offers a quantitative description
allowing us to infer the structure of the underlying network of observables.
Proximity to integrable limit is associated with the rapid growth of
thermalization timescales and, thus, potential numerical challenges. We solve
these challenges by performing numerical tests using computationally efficient
model - unitary maps. The great advantage of unitary maps for numerical
applications is time-discrete error-free evolution. We use these advantages to
perform large timescale and system size computations in extreme proximity to
the integrable limit. To demonstrate the scope of obtained results we report on
the application of the developed framework to Hamiltonian systems.

of GW astrophysics to extract such information as accurately as possible. Yet,
this is only possible if the tools and technology used to detect and analyze
GWs are advanced enough. A key aspect of GW searches are waveform models, which
encapsulate our best predictions for the gravitational radiation under a

coronal electric currents. Here, we explore the nature of coronal currents in
observed and model active region (ARs) by studying manifestations of these
currents in photospheric vector magnetograms. We employ Gauss's separation
method, recently introduced to the solar physics literature, to partition the
photospheric field into three distinct components, each arising from a separate
source: (i) currents passing through the photosphere, (ii) currents flowing
below it, and (iii) currents flowing above it. We refer to component (iii) as
the photospheric imprint of coronal currents. In both AR 10930 and AR 11158,
photospheric imprints exhibit large-scale, spatially coherent structures along
these regions' central, sheared polarity inversion lines (PILs) that are
consistent with coronal currents flowing horizontally above these PILs, similar
to recent findings in AR 12673 by Schuck et al. (2022). We find similar
photospheric imprints in a simple model of a non-potential AR with known
currents. We find that flare-associated changes in photospheric imprints in AR
11158 accord with earlier reports that near-PIL fields become more horizontal,
consistent with the ""implosion"" scenario. We hypothesize that this evolution
effectively shortens, in an overall sense, current-carrying coronal fields,
leading to decreased inductive energy (DIE) in the coronal field. We further
hypothesize that, in the hours prior to flares, parts of the coronal field
slowly expand, in a process we deem coronal inflation (CI) -- essentially, the
inverse of the implosion process. Both of these hypotheses are testable with
non-potential coronal field extrapolations.

semiconductor detector can be smoothly regulated by the value of the bias
voltage of the detector. Therefore, the energy distribution of the ionization
loss of relativistic particles which cross the detector and move in the
channeling regime in the detector crystal can be measured along the path of the
particles at variation of the bias voltage of the detector. Ionization loss
spectra should be different for channeling and nonchanneling particles, and
both fractions can be determined. The application of a Si surface-barrier
detector-target is considered. Measurements with such a detector would make it
possible to study: the energy distribution of ionization loss of channeling
negatively and positively charged particles; spatial distribution of ionization
loss as a function of the path length of channeling particles; the dechanneling
length of negatively charged particles; and to clear up the role of
rechanneling of the particles in the crystal. Comparison of experimental data

offers a way to include non-local correlations in DMFT while also improving
TPSC. The benchmarks are published diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo results for
the two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping.
This method (TPSC+DMFT) is relevant for weak to intermediate interaction,
satisfies the local Pauli principle and allows us to compute a spin
susceptibility that satisfies the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The DMFT double
occupancy determines the spin and charge vertices through local spin and charge
sum rules. The TPSC self-energy is also improved by replacing its local part
with the local DMFT self-energy. With this method, we find improvements for
both spin and charge fluctuations and for the self-energy. We also find that
the accuracy check developed for TPSC is a good predictor of deviations from
benchmarks for this model. TPSC+DMFT can be used in regimes where quantum Monte
Carlo is inaccessible. In addition, this method paves the way to multi-band

critical step in designing a VA system. This step is challenging because it
requires extensive knowledge about domain problems and visualization to design
effective encodings. Existing visualization designs published in top venues are
valuable resources to inspire designs for problems with similar data structures
and tasks. However, those designs are hard to understand, parse, and retrieve
due to the lack of specifications. To address this problem, we build KB4VA, a
knowledge base of visualization designs in VA systems with comprehensive labels
about their analytical tasks and visual encodings. Our labeling scheme is
inspired by a workshop study with 12 VA researchers to learn user requirements
in understanding and retrieving professional visualization designs in VA
systems. The theme extends Vega-Lite specifications for describing advanced and
composited visualization designs in a declarative manner, thus facilitating
human understanding and automatic indexing. To demonstrate the usefulness of
our knowledge base, we present a user study about design inspirations for VA
tasks. In summary, our work opens new perspectives for enhancing the
accessibility and reusability of professional visualization designs.

is theoretically feasible but practically challenging. Effective learning
requires the noise distribution to be approximately similar to the target
distribution, especially in high-dimensional domains. Previous works have
explored modelling the noise distribution as a separate generative model, and
then concurrently training this noise model with the EBM. While this method
allows for more effective noise-contrastive estimation, it comes at the cost of
extra memory and training complexity. Instead, this thesis proposes a
self-adapting NCE algorithm which uses static instances of the EBM along its
training trajectory as the noise distribution. During training, these static
instances progressively converge to the target distribution, thereby
circumventing the need to simultaneously train an auxiliary noise model.
Moreover, we express this self-adapting NCE algorithm in the framework of
Bregman divergences and show that it is a generalization of maximum likelihood
learning for EBMs. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated across a range
of noise update intervals, and experimental results show that shorter update
intervals are conducive to higher synthesis quality.

the Online Fuzzy-set-based Joint Distribution Adaptation for Regression, to
address this challenge. By converting the continuous real-valued labels to

discrepancy are simultaneously measured to achieve the domain adaptation for
the damage quantification task. Thanks to the superiority of the proposed
method, a state-of-the-art online damage quantification framework based on
domain adaptation is presented. Finally, the framework has been comprehensively
demonstrated with a damaged helicopter panel, in which three types of damage
domain adaptations (across different damage locations, across different damage

accuracy of damage quantification can be significantly improved in a realistic
environment. It is expected that the proposed approach to be applied to the

acceleration system. A prototype of the ITER HNB ion source is being tested in
the SPIDER experiment, part of the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility at Consorzio
RFX. Reaching the design targets for beam current density and fraction of
coextracted electrons is only possible by evaporating cesium in the source, in
particular on the plasma facing grid (PG) of the acceleration system. In this
way the work function of the surfaces decreases, significantly increasing the
amount of surface reactions that convert neutrals and positive ions into H-/D-.
It is then of paramount importance to monitor the density of negative ions and
the density of Cs in the proximity of the PG. Monitoring the Cs spatial
distribution along the PG is also essential to guarantee the uniformity of the
beam current. In SPIDER, this is possible thanks to the Cavity Ringdown
Spectroscopy (CRDS) and the Laser absorption Spectroscopy diagnostics (LAS),
which provide line-integrated measurements of negative ion density and neutral,
ground state Cs density, respectively. The paper discusses the CRDS and LAS
measurements as a function of input power and of the magnetic and electric
field used to reduce the coextraction of electrons. Negative ion density data
are in qualitative agreement with the results in Cs-free conditions. In
agreement with simulations, Cs density is peaked in the center of the source; a
top/bottom non uniformity is however present. Several effects of plasma on Cs

to bound the probability of vanishing to order at least $r$ at the central
point for families of cuspidal newforms of prime level $N \to \infty$, split by
sign. There are three methods to improve bounds on the order of vanishing:
optimizing the test functions, increasing the support, and increasing the
$n$-level density studied. Previous work determined the optimal test functions
for the $1$ and $2$-level densities in certain support ranges, leading to
marginal improvements in bounds and making it not a productive avenue for
further research. Similarly the support has been increased as far as possible,
and further progress is shown to be related to delicate and difficult
conjectures in number theory. Thus we concentrate on the third method, and
study the higher centered moments (which are similar to the $n$-level densities
but combinatorially easier). We find the level at each rank for which the
bounds on the order of vanishing is the best, thus producing world-record
bounds on the order of vanishing to rank at least $r$ for every $r > 2$ (for
example, our bounds for vanishing to order at least 5 or at least 6 are less
than half the previous bounds, a significant improvement). Additionally, we
explicitly calculate the optimal test function for the $1$-level density from
previous work and compare it to the naive test functions for higher levels. In
doing so, we find that the optimal test function for certain levels are not the
optimal for other levels, and some test functions may outperform others for
some levels but not in others. Finally, we explicitly calculate the integrals
needed to determine the bounds, doing so by transforming an $n$-dimensional
integral to a $1$-dimensional integral and greatly reducing the computation
cost in the process.

this study, total 68 samples (33 cancerous and 35 normal) of 18 OSCC patients

Main remarkable finding of the study is presence of three peaks viz ~636 nm,

in case of autofluorescence. Another finding is red shift in fluorescence
spectroscopy of OSCC, dysplasia and fibrosis from normal which is 6.59+-4.54
nm, 3+-4.78 nm and 1.5+-0.5 nm respectively and can be used as cancer marker in
real-time screening. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) based classifier is
applied for classification of OSCC tissue from normal tissue. The average
sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are found as 88.89% ,100 %, and 95%,

classes (and fast promotion speed classes) in the past were currently the most
productive. In contrast, scientists in old promotion age classes (and slow
promotion speed classes) in the past were currently the least productive. In
the three largest disciplines, the young-old promotion age productivity
differential for associate professors was 100-200% (150-200% for full
professors); and the fast-slow promotion speed productivity differential for
associate professors was 80-150% (100-170% for full professors). Our results
were confirmed by a regression analysis in which we found odds ratio estimates
of membership in top productivity classes. We combined data collected from the

feature common to a large class of monostable traveling wave equations. As one
varies the non-linearities it so happens that one can observe, at some critical
non linearity, a transition from pulled fronts to pushed fronts. At this
transition the Bramson shift is modified. In the limit where time goes to
infinity and the non-linearity becomes critical, the position of the front
exhibits a cross-over. The goal of the present note is to give the expression
of this cross-over function, for a particular model which is exactly soluble,
with the hope that this expression would remain valid for more general
traveling wave equations at the transition between pulled and pushed fronts.
Other cross-over functions are also obtained, for this particular model, to
describe the dependence on initial conditions or the effect of a cut-off.

hypothesized that when a drop sinks on a lubricated surface, quasi-static
wetting morphology can be numerically computed only from the knowledge of

Evolver software for the numerical computation of the interface profiles for a
four-phase system. For the experiments, we used drops of 80 wt% formamide on
silicone oil coated substrates with varying lubricant thickness, substrate
wettability and drop volume. Optical images of drops were used to compare the
experimental interfacial profiles and apparent contact angles with the
numerically computed ones. We found good agreement between the experiments and
the simulations for the interfacial profiles and apparent contact angles as a
function of various systems parameters except for very thin lubricating films.
Apparent contact angles varied non-linearly as a function of substrate
wettability and lubricant thickness, however, were found constant with the drop

from computing to communication, primarily the aggregation-averaging (Agg-Avg)
process of DEL. The existing transmission control protocol (TCP)-based data
networking schemes for DEL are application-agnostic and fail to deliver
adjustments according to application layer requirements. As a result, they
introduce massive excess time and undesired issues such as unfairness and
stragglers. Other prior mitigation solutions have significant limitations as
they balance data flow rates from workers across paths but often incur
imbalanced backlogs when the paths exhibit variance, causing stragglers. To
facilitate a more productive DEL, we develop a hybrid multipath TCP (MPTCP) by
combining model-based and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based MPTCP for DEL
that strives to realize quicker iteration of DEL and better fairness (by
ameliorating stragglers). Hybrid MPTCP essentially integrates two radical TCP
developments: i) successful existing model-based MPTCP control strategies and
ii) advanced emerging DRL-based techniques, and introduces a novel hybrid MPTCP
data transport for easing the communication of the Agg-Avg process. Extensive
emulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid MPTCP can overcome
excess time consumption and ameliorate the application layer unfairness of DEL
effectively without injecting additional inconstancy and stragglers.

applications of two-dimensional nanomaterials in electronics or energy storage.
Recently, experimentalists have observed the evolution of boundaries for
fullerene clusters sandwiched by two graphene layers, while vacuum space with
typical dimension of 30 {\AA} was found within the fullerene layer. Because the
pattern of the fullerene cluster impacts the physical properties of the
sandwiches, it is important to understand the mechanisms for their structural
transformations. In the present work, we find that the
graphene/fullerene/graphene sandwich structure transforms among three
configurations, depending on the fullerene to graphene area ratio. Molecular
dynamics simulations show that there are two critical values for the area
ratio. The fullerene pattern transforms from circular to rectangular at the
first critical area ratio of 1/{\pi}. The critical value of 1/{\pi} is
successfully derived by comparing the geometrical perimeter of the circular and
rectangular shapes for the fullerene cluster without any physical parameters.
At the second critical area ratio, the graphene layers surrounding the
fullerene cluster become separated due to the competition between the bending
energy and the cohesive energy. Based on the analytic model, the vacuum space
is predicted to be 34 {\AA}, which agrees quite well with the experimental
result. These findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms driving
structural transformation of fullerene-based sandwiches, which will enable the
selection of appropriate structures and materials to guide the design of future
electronic and energy storage applications.

systems in spatiotemporally correlated channel environments, where the
destination can move within a confined area. The objective is to maximize the
expected sum of SNRs at the receiver over infinite time horizons. The problem
formulation gives rise to a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We propose a deep
actor-critic algorithm that accounts for channel correlations and destination
motion by constructing the state representation to include the current position
of the receiver and the phase shift values and receiver positions that
correspond to a window of previous time steps. The channel variability induces
high frequency components on the spectrum of the underlying value function. We
propose the preprocessing of the critic's input with a Fourier kernel which
enables stable value learning. Finally, we investigate the use of the
destination SNR as a component of the designed MDP state, which is common
practice in previous work. We provide empirical evidence that, when the
channels are spatiotemporally correlated, the inclusion of the SNR in the state
representation interacts with function approximation in ways that inhibit
convergence.

the frequency range of these potentially important devices still remains
obscure. We investigated superconducting micro-bridges of Nb$_{3}$Sn in
out-of-plane magnetic fields; optimum magnetic fields of $\sim$10 mT generate
$\sim $10% diode efficiency, while higher fields of $\sim$15-20 mT quench the
effect. The diode changes its polarity with magnetic field reversal. We
documented superconductive diode rectification at frequencies up to 100 kHz,
the highest reported as of today. Interestingly, the bridge resistance during
diode operation reaches a value that is a factor of two smaller than in its
normal state, which is compatible with the vortex-caused mechanism of
resistivity. This is confirmed by finite element modeling based on
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. To explain experimental findings, no
assumption of lattice thermal inequilibrium was required. Dissimilar edges of
