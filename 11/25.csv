side group substituted at different positions is reported. The infrared
spectral variations due to the position of phenyl substitution, ionization
state and the size of the molecules are discussed and possible contribution of
phenyl-PAHs to the mid-infrared emission features from astrophysical objects is
analyzed. Structurally phenyl group substitution at 2nd position gives more
stable species compared to substitution at other positions. Phenyl-PAHs exhibit
new aromatic bands near 695 and 741 cm$^{-1}$ (14.4 and 13.5 $\mu$m), due to
contribution from quintet C-H wag, that compare well with minor features at
14.2 and 13.5 $\mu$m observed in several astrophysical objects. Just as in
plain PAHs, the C-C stretch vibrational modes ($\sim$1600 cm$^{-1}$) have
negligible intensity in neutrals, but the cations of all phenyl-PAHs exhibit
significantly strong phenyl group C-C stretch peak close to class B type 6.2
$\mu$m astrophysical band. In 2-phenylpyrene, it is the neutral molecule that
exhibits this strong feature in the 6.2 $\mu$m range along with other features
that match with sub-features at 6.66 and 6.9 $\mu$m, observed in astronomical
spectra of some late type objects. The substitution of phenyl side group at
solo position shifts the C-C stretch mode of parent PAH close to the region of
6.2 $\mu$m astrophysical band. The results indicate possibility of phenyl-PAHs
in space and the bottom-up formation of medium sized compact PAHs with phenyl
side group in carbon rich cool circumstellar shells. Phenyl-PAHs need to be
considered in modelling mid-infrared emission spectra of various astrophysical

  Random Covariates",,,,,"stat.ME math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider performing simulation experiments in the presence of covariates.
Here, covariates refer to some input information other than system designs to
the simulation model that can also affect the system performance. To make
decisions, decision makers need to know the covariate values of the problem.
Traditionally in simulation-based decision making, simulation samples are
collected after the covariate values are known; in contrast, as a new
framework, simulation with covariates starts the simulation before the
covariate values are revealed, and collects samples on covariate values that
might appear later. Then, when the covariate values are revealed, the collected
simulation samples are directly used to predict the desired results. This
framework significantly reduces the decision time compared to the traditional
way of simulation. In this paper, we follow this framework and suppose there
are a finite number of system designs. We adopt the metamodel of stochastic
kriging (SK) and use it to predict the system performance of each design and
the best design. The goal is to study how fast the prediction errors diminish
with the number of covariate points sampled. This is a fundamental problem in
simulation with covariates and helps quantify the relationship between the
offline simulation efforts and the online prediction accuracy. Particularly, we
adopt measures of the maximal integrated mean squared error (IMSE) and
integrated probability of false selection (IPFS) for assessing errors of the
system performance and the best design predictions. Then, we establish
convergence rates for the two measures under mild conditions. Last, these
convergence behaviors are illustrated numerically using test examples.

that ac fields with a vanishing time average provide an alternative route to
steering active particles. We exemplify this route for inertial active

of data, missing data; and (iii) Model uncertainty. These challenges must be
resolved to gain the trust in DT framework development. In addition,
DT-enabling technologies consist of three major areas: (i) modeling and

data-informed modeling, (ii) Advanced sensors/instrumentation, and (iii) Data

who showed that it holds for graphs with vertex and edge weights from an
arbitrary field of characteristic 0. In this work, we generalize from graph
homomorphism -- a special case of #CSP with a single binary function -- to
general #CSP by showing that two sets $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of
arbitrary constraint functions are isomorphic if and only if the partition
function of any #CSP instance is unchanged when we replace the functions in

Second, we give a proof using the intertwiners of the automorphism group of a
constraint function set, a concept from the representation theory of compact

the design of materials that can fill specific roles in devices. For example,
materials with low symmetry allow unconventional configurations of

torques. Here, we explore the relationship between crystal symmetry and
geometry of the Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) that causes spin accumulation in
response to an applied electric current. Based on a symmetry analysis performed
for 230 crystallographic space groups, we identify classes of materials that
can host conventional or collinear REE. Although transverse spin accumulation
is commonly associated with the so-called 'Rashba materials', we show that the
presence of specific spin texture does not easily translate to the
configuration of REE. More specifically, bulk crystals may simultaneously host
different types of spin-orbit fields, depending on the crystallographic point
group and the symmetry of the specific $k$-vector, which, averaged over the
Brillouin zone, determine the direction and magnitude of the induced spin
accumulation. To explore the connection between crystal symmetry, spin texture,
and the magnitude of REE, we perform first-principles calculations for
representative materials with different symmetries. We believe that our results
will be helpful for further computational and experimental studies, as well as
the design of spintronics devices.

after every encrypted gate computation.
  We present FPT, a Fixed-Point FPGA accelerator for TFHE bootstrapping. FPT is
the first hardware accelerator to heavily exploit the inherent noise present in
FHE calculations. Instead of double or single-precision floating-point
arithmetic, it implements TFHE bootstrapping entirely with approximate
fixed-point arithmetic. Using an in-depth analysis of noise propagation in
bootstrapping FFT computations, FPT is able to use noise-trimmed fixed-point
representations that are up to 50% smaller than prior implementations using
floating-point or integer FFTs.
  FPT's microarchitecture is built as a streaming processor inspired by
traditional streaming DSPs: it instantiates high-throughput computational
stages that are directly cascaded, with simplified control logic and routing
networks. FPT's streaming approach allows 100% utilization of arithmetic units
and requires only small bootstrapping key caches, enabling an entirely
compute-bound bootstrapping throughput of 1 BS / 35$\mu$s. This is in stark
contrast to the established classical CPU approach to FHE bootstrapping
acceleration, which tends to be heavily memory and bandwidth-constrained.
  FPT is fully implemented and evaluated as a bootstrapping FPGA kernel for an
Alveo U280 datacenter accelerator card. FPT achieves almost three orders of
magnitude higher bootstrapping throughput than existing CPU-based
implementations, and 2.5$\times$ higher throughput compared to recent ASIC
emulation experiments.

  early-stage surveillance",,,,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper we used an adapted version of an existing simulation model of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Scotland to investigate the rise of the Omicron
variant of concern, in order to evaluate plausible scenarios for transmission
advantage and vaccine immune escape relative to the Delta variant. We also
explored possible outcomes of different levels of imposed non-pharmaceutical
intervention. The initial results of these scenarios were used to inform the
Scottish Government in the early outbreak stages of the Omicron variant.
  We use an explicitly spatial agent-based simulation model combined with
spatially fine-grained COVID-19 observation data from Public Health Scotland.
Using the model with parameters fit over the Delta variant epidemic, some
initial assumptions about Omicron transmission advantage and vaccine escape,
and a simple growth rate fitting procedure, we were able to capture the initial
outbreak dynamics for Omicron. We also find the modelled dynamics hold up to
retrospective scrutiny.
  We found that the modelled imposition of extra non-pharmaceutical
interventions planned by the Scottish Government at the time would likely have
little effect in light of the transmission advantage held by the Omicron
variant and the fact that the planned interventions would have occurred too
late in the outbreak's trajectory. Finally, we found that any assumptions made
about the projected distribution of vaccines in the model population had little
bearing on the outcome, in terms of outbreak size and timing, rather that the
detailed landscape of immunity prior to the outbreak was of far greater
importance.

with machine learning on large complex networks.
  Indeed, most modern networks such as citation, blockchain, and online social

of existing TDA methods infeasible. We develop two new, remarkably simple but
effective algorithms to compute the exact persistence diagrams of large graphs
to address this major TDA limitation. First, we prove that $(k+1)$-core of a

$PD_k(\mathcal{G})$. Second, we introduce a pruning algorithm for graphs to
compute their persistence diagrams by removing the dominated vertices. Our
experiments on large networks show that our novel approach can achieve
computational gains up to 95%.

formation, quenching, and feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) seem
to be connected, however, the nature of these relations remains unclear. In
this work, we aim to elucidate them by studying the formation of a barred
galaxy in a major merger of two disks in the IllustrisTNG simulations. This
merger involves a coalescence of two supermassive black holes and a sudden
switch to the kinetic mode of AGN feedback implemented in the simulations,
which leads to the removal of the gas from the inner part of the galaxy,
followed by quenching of star formation and the formation of the bar. This
causal relation between AGN feedback and bar formation explains a number of
correlations observed in the data, such as the higher frequency of bars among
red spirals and the presence of central gas holes in barred galaxies. In such a
picture, the bars do not feed the black holes, so their presence does not
increase the AGN strength, and they do not cause quenching. However, bars do
form in regions characterized by a low gas fraction resulting from AGN
feedback. This scenario is probably applicable to many barred galaxies, not
only those formed in major mergers.

to avoid collisions are designed using dynamic vortex potential fields (PFs)

between the robots, denoted as being cooperative. The repulsive field is
selected as a function of the velocity and position of a robot relative to
another and introducing vorticity in its definition guarantees the absence of
local minima. Such a repulsive field is activated by a robot only when it is on
a collision path with other mobile robots or stationary obstacles. By analysing
the kinematics-based engagement dynamics in polar coordinates, it is shown that
a cooperative robot is able to avoid collisions with non-cooperating robots,
such as stationary and constant velocity robots, as well as those actively
seeking to collide with it. Conditions on the PF parameters are identified that
ensure collision avoidance for all cases. Experimental results acquired using a
mobile robot platform support the theoretical contributions.

reduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances
model performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been
adopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural
language processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging
line of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an
ultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving
impressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches
without using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal
solutions on real-world problems. In particular, standard training that
minimizes the empirical loss on the training data can easily suffer from
overfitting to low-resource tasks or be spoiled by noisy-labeled ones, which
can cause negative transfer between tasks and overall performance drop. To
alleviate such problems, we propose to leverage a recently introduced training

generalization ability on single-task learning. Accordingly, we present a novel
MTL training methodology, encouraging the model to find task-based flat minima
for coherently improving its generalization capability on all tasks. Finally,

manipulating and boosting the coupling between drifting electrons and

we analytically develop expressions for (apparent hydrodynamic) slip lengths

pitch of the ridges divided by the height of the microchannel. When the ridges
are oriented parallel to the flow, we quantify the error in the Nusselt number
expressions in the literature and provide a new closed-form result. The latter
is accurate to $O\left(\epsilon^2\right)$ and valid for any solid (ridge)
fraction, whereas those in the current literature are accurate to
$O\left(\epsilon^1\right)$ and breakdown in the important limit when solid
fraction approaches zero. When the ridges are oriented transverse to the
(periodically fully-developed) flow, the error associated with neglecting
inertial effects in the slip length is shown to be
$O\left(\epsilon^3\mathrm{Re}\right)$, where $\mathrm{Re}$ is the channel-scale
Reynolds number based on its hydraulic diameter. The corresponding Nusselt
number expressions are new and their accuracy is shown to be dependent on
Reynolds number, Peclet number and Prandtl number in addition to $\epsilon$.

handles that can guide spatial properties of the synthesized images. In this
work, we introduce a universal approach to guide a pretrained text-to-image
diffusion model, with a spatial map from another domain (e.g., sketch) during
inference time. Unlike previous works, our method does not require to train a
dedicated model or a specialized encoder for the task. Our key idea is to train
a Latent Guidance Predictor (LGP) - a small, per-pixel, Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) that maps latent features of noisy images to spatial maps, where the deep
features are extracted from the core Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(DDPM) network. The LGP is trained only on a few thousand images and
constitutes a differential guiding map predictor, over which the loss is
computed and propagated back to push the intermediate images to agree with the
spatial map. The per-pixel training offers flexibility and locality which
allows the technique to perform well on out-of-domain sketches, including
free-hand style drawings. We take a particular focus on the sketch-to-image
translation task, revealing a robust and expressive way to generate images that
follow the guidance of a sketch of arbitrary style or domain. Project page:

images showing the same location at different times. Ideally, this teaches the
model to ignore changes caused by seasons, weather conditions or image
acquisition artifacts. However, unlike in traditional contrastive methods, this
can result in undesired positive pairs, since we form them without human
supervision. For example, a positive pair might consist of one image before a
disaster and one after. This could teach the model to ignore the differences
between intact and damaged buildings, which might be what we want to detect in
the downstream task. Similar to false negative pairs, this could impede model
performance. Crucially, in this setting only parts of the images differ in
relevant ways, while other parts remain similar. Surprisingly, we find that
downstream semantic segmentation is either robust to such badly matched pairs
or even benefits from them. The experiments are conducted on the remote sensing
dataset xBD, and a synthetic segmentation dataset for which we have full

double-humped spectral energy distribution. It is of common consensus the
Synchrotron emission to be responsible for the low frequency peak, while the
origin of the high frequency hump is still debated. The analysis of X-rays and
their polarization can provide a valuable tool to understand the physical
mechanisms responsible for the origin of high-energy emission of blazars. We
report the first observations of BL Lacertae performed with the Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer ({IXPE}), from which an upper limit to the polarization
degree $\Pi_X<$12.6\% was found in the 2-8 keV band. We contemporaneously
measured the polarization in radio, infrared, and optical wavelengths. Our
multiwavelength polarization analysis disfavors a significant contribution of
proton synchrotron radiation to the X-ray emission at these epochs. Instead, it
supports a leptonic origin for the X-ray emission in BL Lac.

bolometric luminosity, radio loudness, obscuration, and spectroscopic type. We
find that almost all AGN in this sample exhibit substantial higher-order modes
of variability than is contained in the power spectrum, with approximately half
exhibiting nonlinear or non-stationary behavior. We find that Type 2 AGN are
more likely to contain deterministic variability than Type 1 AGN while the same

whether prescribed functional forms of the pair correlation function $g_2(r)$
[or equivalently, structure factor $S(k)$] at some number density $\rho$ can be
achieved by $d$-dimensional many-body systems. The Zhang-Torquato conjecture
states that any realizable set of pair statistics, whether from a
nonequilibrium or equilibrium system, can be achieved by equilibrium systems
involving up to two-body interactions.
  In light of this conjecture, we study the realizability problem of the
nonequilibrium iso-$g_2$ process, i.e., the determination of density-dependent
effective potentials that yield equilibrium states in which $g_2$ remains
invariant for a positive range of densities.
  Using a precise inverse methodology that determines effective potentials that
match hypothesized functional forms of $g_2(r)$ for all $r$ and $S(k)$ for all
$k$, we show that the unit-step function $g_2$, which is the zero-density limit
of the hard-sphere potential, is remarkably numerically realizable up to the
packing fraction $\phi=0.49$ for $d=1$. For $d=2$ and 3, it is realizable up to
the maximum ``terminal'' packing fraction $\phi_c=1/2^d$, at which the systems
are hyperuniform, implying that the explicitly known necessary conditions for
realizability are sufficient up through $\phi_c$.
  For $\phi$ near but below $\phi_c$, the large-$r$ behaviors of the effective
potentials are given exactly by the functional forms $\exp[-\kappa(\phi) r]$

significant interest in mining population-level EEG patterns using unsupervised

using the canonical polyadic decomposition to discover a parsimonious set of
population-level EEG patterns, retaining the natural multi-dimensional

value using a cohort of patients including varying stages of cognitive
impairment. Our results show that the discovered patterns reflect
physiologically meaningful features and accurately classify the stages of
cognitive impairment (healthy vs mild cognitive impairment vs Alzheimer's

gradients on the distribution of colloidal particles, i.e., colloidal banding,
induced via diffusiophoresis. The solute gradients are generated by spatially
arranged sources and sinks that emit/absorb a time-dependent solute flux. First
we study a dipole system, i.e., one source and one sink, and discover that
interdipole diffusion and flux decay timescales dictate colloidal banding. At
timescales shorter than the interdipole diffusion timescale, we observe a rapid
enhancement in particle enrichment around the source due to repulsion from the
sink. However, at timescales longer than the interdipole diffusion timescale,
the source and sink screen each other, leading to a slower enhancement. If the
solute flux decays at the timescale of interdipole diffusion, an optimal
separation distance is obtained such that particle enrichment is maximized. We
find that the partition coefficient between solute inside the source and the
bulk strongly impacts the optimal separation distance. Surprisingly, the
diffusivity ratio between solute in the source and bulk has a much weaker
impact on the optimal dipole separation distance. We also examine an octupole
configuration, i.e., four sinks and four sources, arranged in a circle, and
demonstrate that the geometric arrangement that maximizes enrichment depends on
the radius of the circle. If the radius of the circle is small, it is preferred
to have sources and sinks arranged in an alternating fashion. However, if the
radius of the circle is large, a consecutive arrangement of sources and sinks
is optimal. Our numerical framework introduces a novel method for spatially and
temporally designing the banded structure of colloidal particles in two
dimensions using diffusiophoresis and opens up new avenues in a field that has
primarily focused on one-dimensional solute gradients.

30%. The key behind such high efficiency is the inclusion of a highly efficient
mirror in the rear of the TPV cell that turns back to the thermal emitter the
outband energy photons. Efficiencies over 50% could be theoretically attainable
by approaching a mirror reflectance of 100%. However, the very few percent of
outband absorption significantly deteriorate the conversion efficiency. Thus,
current research focuses on developing advance mirror designs able to reach an
extreme high outband reflectance over 95%. In this article I propose a bifacial
TPV cell that enables very efficient photon recycling without using mirrors and
that is less sensitive to outband optical losses. The key to this design is
that the cell is introduced in a thermal emitter enclosure where it is
irradiated from both sides. Then, outband photons transmit through the cell and
are re-absorbed in the emitter. Therefore, the optical losses linked to the
mirror/cell interface are eliminated, potentially enabling higher photon
recycling efficiencies. This article presents a detailed balance simulation of
an edge-cooled bifacial TPV cell to demonstrate that bifacial configuration
enables higher conversion efficiencies and twice much as power density than
monofacial designs, the latter being a remarkable advantage for moderate
temperature and low-cost TPV power generation. Therefore, bifacial TPV cells
are appealing for developing practical high-efficient and low-cost TPV devices
for power generation in an extended range of heat source temperatures.

bottleneck. Gradient Coding (GC), introduced by Tandon et al., is an efficient
technique that uses principles of error-correcting codes to distribute gradient
computation in the presence of stragglers. In this paper, we consider the
distributed computation of a sequence of gradients $\{g(1),g(2),\ldots,g(J)\}$,
where processing of each gradient $g(t)$ starts in round-$t$ and finishes by
round-$(t+T)$. Here $T\geq 0$ denotes a delay parameter. For the GC scheme,
coding is only across computing nodes and this results in a solution where
$T=0$. On the other hand, having $T>0$ allows for designing schemes which
exploit the temporal dimension as well. In this work, we propose two schemes
that demonstrate improved performance compared to GC. Our first scheme combines
GC with selective repetition of previously unfinished tasks and achieves
improved straggler mitigation. In our second scheme, which constitutes our main
contribution, we apply GC to a subset of the tasks and repetition for the
remainder of the tasks. We then multiplex these two classes of tasks across
workers and rounds in an adaptive manner, based on past straggler patterns.
Using theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our second scheme achieves
significant reduction in the computational load. In our experiments, we study a
practical setting of concurrently training multiple neural networks over an AWS
Lambda cluster involving 256 worker nodes, where our framework naturally
applies. We demonstrate that the latter scheme can yield a 16\% improvement in

resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ir L3 edge for different x.
We demonstrate that magnetism in Ba$_3$Ti$_{3-x}$Ir$_x$O$_9$ is governed by an
unconventional realization of strong disorder, where cation disorder affects
the character of the local moments. RIXS interferometry, studying the RIXS
intensity over a broad range of transferred momentum q, is ideally suited to
assign different excitations to different Ir sites. We find pronounced Ir-Ti
site mixing. Both ions are distributed over two crystallographically
inequivalent sites, giving rise to a coexistence of quasimolecular singlet
states on Ir2O9 dimers and spin-orbit entangled j=1/2 moments of 5d$^5$
Ir$^{4+}$ ions. RIXS reveals different kinds of strong magnetic couplings for
different bonding geometries, highlighting the role of cation disorder for the
suppression of long-range magnetic order in this family of compounds.

thirty-four human-avatar interactions, performed complete linguistic
microanalysis on video excerpts, and marked all the occurrences of multimodal

comprehend not only how often multimodal actions occur but also how multimodal
events are distributed between the speaker (emitter) and the listener

each modality. The data show evidence that double-loop feedback is established
during a face-to-face conversation. This led us to propose that knowledge from
Conversation Analysis (CA), cognitive science, and Theory of Mind (ToM), among
others, should be incorporated into the ones used for describing human-machine
multimodal interactions. Face-to-face interfaces require an additional control
layer to the multimodal fusion layer. This layer has to organize the flow of
conversation, integrate the social context into the interaction, as well as
make plans concerning 'what' and 'how' to progress on the interaction. This
higher level is best understood if we incorporate insights from CA and ToM into

the simple conceptual premise behind their formation, computational
high-throughput first-principles design of such materials is extremely
challenging due to the large number of realizations required for sufficient
statistical sampling of their design space. Furthermore, MPEMs are also known
to develop short-ranged orderings (SROs) which can play a significant role in
their stability and properties. Here, we present an expedient and efficient
first-principles computational framework for assessing the compositional and
mechanical properties of MPEMs, including SRO effects. This heuristic
methodology systematically corrects phase-averaged free-energies of MPEMs to
include SRO phases, while imposing constraints for materials design. To
illustrate the methodology, we study the stability and mechanical properties of
equi-molar refractory-metal high-entropy alloy carbonitrides (RHEA-CNs) such as
ZrNbMoHfTaWC3N3. We show that SRO, arising due to preferential neighboring
among refractory metals, is necessary for thermodynamic and mechanical
stability and to satisfy the imposed design criteria, leading to complex
compositions for which their molar fraction and mechanical properties are
predicted.

range and have a quadratic dispersion near the zero wavevector. In contrast,
magnons in antiferromagnets are commonly considered to have bands with both
chiralities that are degenerate across the entire Brillouin zone, and to be in
the THz range and to have a linear dispersion near the center of the Brillouin
zone. Here we theoretically demonstrate a new class of magnons on a
prototypical $d$-wave altermagnet RuO$_2$ with the compensated antiparallel
magnetic order in the ground state. Based on density-functional-theory
calculations we observe that the THz-range magnon bands in RuO$_2$ have an
alternating chirality splitting, similar to the alternating spin splitting of
the electronic bands, and a linear magnon dispersion near the zero wavevector.
We also show that, overall, the Landau damping of this metallic altermagnet is
suppressed due to the spin-split electronic structure, as compared to an
artificial antiferromagnetic phase of the same RuO$_2$ crystal with
spin-degenerate electronic bands and chirality-degenerate magnon bands.

learn about the normality based on which it detects if an input image contains
an anomalous/threat object. The proposed model uses a generator with an
encoder-decoder network having dense convolutional skip connections for
enhanced reconstruction and to capture the data distribution. A self-attention
augmented discriminator is used having the ability to check the consistency of
detailed features even in distant portions. We use spectral normalisation to
facilitate stable and improved training of the GAN. Experiments are performed
on three datasets, viz. CIFAR-10, MVTec AD (for industrial applications) and

science. Often, the data formats, structures and semantics of data change over
time, the data sets evolve. Therefore, studies over several decades in
particular have to consider changing database schemas. The evolution of these
databases lead at some point to a large number of schemas, which have to be
stored and managed, costly and time-consuming. However, in the sense of
reproducibility of research data each database version must be reconstructable
with little effort. So a previously published result can be validated and
reproduced at any time.
  Nevertheless, in many cases, such an evolution can not be fully
reconstructed. This article classifies the 15 most frequently used schema
modification operators and defines the associated inverses for each operation.
For avoiding an information loss, it furthermore defines which additional
provenance information have to be stored. We define four classes dealing with
dangling tuples, duplicates and provenance-invariant operators. Each class will
be presented by one representative.
  By using and extending the theory of schema mappings and their inverses for
queries, data analysis, why-provenance, and schema evolution, we are able to
combine data analysis applications with provenance under evolving database
structures, in order to enable the reproducibility of scientific results over
longer periods of time. While most of the inverses of schema mappings used for
analysis or evolution are not exact, but only quasi-inverses, adding provenance
information enables us to reconstruct a sub-database of research data that is
sufficient to guarantee reproducibility.

While over 1000 supernova remnants (SNRs) are estimated to exist in
the Milky Way, only less than 400 have been found to date. In the context of
this apparent deficiency, more than 150 SNR candidates were recently identified
in the D-configuration Very Large Array (VLA-D) continuum images of the 4--8
GHz global view on star formation (GLOSTAR) survey, in the Galactic longitude
range $-2^\circ<l<60^\circ$. Aims. We attempt to find evidence of nonthermal
synchrotron emission from 35 SNR candidates in the region of Galactic longitude
range $28^\circ<l<36^\circ$, and also to study the radio continuum emission
from the previously confirmed SNRs in this region. Methods. Using the
short-spacing corrected GLOSTAR VLA-D+Effelsberg images, we measure ${\sim}6$
GHz total and linearly polarized flux densities of the SNR candidates and the
SNRs that were previously confirmed. We also attempt to determine the spectral
indices by measuring flux densities from complementary Galactic plane surveys
and from the temperature-temperature plots of the GLOSTAR-Effelsberg images.
Results. We provide evidence of nonthermal emission from four candidates that
have spectral indices and polarization consistent with a SNR origin, and,
considering their morphology, we are confident that three of these
(G28.36+0.21, G28.78-0.44, and G29.38+0.10) are indeed SNRs. However, about
$25\%$ of the candidates have spectral index measurements that indicate thermal
emission, and the rest of them are too faint to have a good constraint on the
spectral index yet. Conclusions. Additional observations at longer wavelengths
and higher sensitivities will shed more light on the nature of these
candidates. A simple Monte-Carlo simulation reiterates the view that future
studies must persist with the current strategy of searching for SNRs with small
angular size to solve the problem of the Milky Way's missing SNRs.

ICD codes are infrequently assigned yet infrequent ICD codes are important
clinically. This study addresses the long-tail challenge by transforming this
multi-label classification task into an autoregressive generation task.
Specifically, we first introduce a novel pretraining objective to generate free
text diagnoses and procedure using the SOAP structure, the medical logic
physicians use for note documentation. Second, instead of directly predicting
the high dimensional space of ICD codes, our model generates the lower
dimension of text descriptions, which then infer ICD codes. Third, we designed
a novel prompt template for multi-label classification. We evaluate our

Depending on the nature of the obstacles we call them either entropic or
energetic barriers. For energetic barriers we find that the timescales of first
passage vary non-monotonically with the number of barriers, while for entropic
barriers first passage times increase monotonically. We perform an exact
analytic calculation to derive closed form solutions for the mean first passage
time for different theoretical models of diffusion. Our analytic results
capture this counter-intuitive non-monotonic behaviour for energetic barriers.
We also show non-monotonic effective diffusivity in the case of energetic
barriers. Finally, using numerical simulations, we show this non-monotonic

X-ray-selected sources in the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) in
order to place a lower limit on black hole accretion well into the epoch of
re-ionisation. We confirm the low significance detection with eROSITA of a
previously known, optically faint $z=6.56$ quasar from the Subaru High-z
Exploration of Low-luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) survey. We obtained a pointed
follow-up observation of the source with the Chandra X-ray telescope in order
to confirm the eROSITA detection. Using new near-infrared spectroscopy, we
derived the physical properties of the super-massive black hole. Finally, we
used this detection to infer a lower limit on the black hole accretion density
rate at $z>6$. The Chandra observation confirms the eFEDS source as the most
distant blind X-ray detection to date. The derived X-ray luminosity is high
with respect to the rest-frame optical emission of the quasar. With a narrow
MgII line, low derived black hole mass, and high Eddington ratio, as well as
its steep photon index, the source shows properties that are similar to local
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, which are thought to be powered by young
super-massive black holes. In combination with a previous high-redshift quasar
detection in the field, we show that quasars with $L_{2-10 \, \mathrm{keV}}
>10^{45} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ dominate accretion onto super-massive black
holes at $z\sim 6$.

Nevertheless, agile methodologies focus on contact with contracting customers

end users face in their routines. Hence, UX issues are typically identified
only after the implementation, during user testing and validation. Objective:
Aiming to improve the understanding and definition of the problem in agile
projects, this research investigates the practices and difficulties experienced
by agile teams during the development of data science and process automation
projects. Also, we analyze the benefits and the teams' perceptions regarding
user participation in these projects. Method: We collected data from four agile
teams in an academia-industry collaboration focusing on delivering data science
and process automation solutions. Therefore, we applied a carefully designed
questionnaire answered by developers, scrum masters, and UX designers. In
total, 18 subjects answered the questionnaire. Results: From the results, we
identify practices used by the teams to define and understand the problem and
to represent the solution. The practices most often used are prototypes and
meetings with stakeholders. Another practice that helped the team to understand
the problem was using Lean Inceptions. Also, our results present some specific

help to define elements of the domain and barriers in the implementation. We
identified a need for approaches that facilitate user-team communication in

  Application to cardiac cine-MR images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical image registration is a challenging task involving the estimation of
spatial transformations to establish anatomical correspondence between pairs or
groups of images. Recently, deep learning-based image registration methods have
been widely explored, and demonstrated to enable fast and accurate image
registration in a variety of applications. However, most deep learning-based
registration methods assume that the deformation fields are smooth and
continuous everywhere in the image domain, which is not always true, especially
when registering images whose fields of view contain discontinuities at
tissue/organ boundaries. In such scenarios, enforcing smooth, globally
continuous deformation fields leads to incorrect/implausible registration
results. We propose a novel discontinuity-preserving image registration method
to tackle this challenge, which ensures globally discontinuous and locally
smooth deformation fields, leading to more accurate and realistic registration
results. The proposed method leverages the complementary nature of image
segmentation and registration and enables joint segmentation and pair-wise
registration of images. A co-attention block is proposed in the segmentation
component of the network to learn the structural correlations in the input
images, while a discontinuity-preserving registration strategy is employed in
the registration component of the network to ensure plausibility in the
estimated deformation fields at tissue/organ interfaces. We evaluate our method
on the task of intra-subject spatio-temporal image registration using
large-scale cinematic cardiac magnetic resonance image sequences, and
demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art for medical image registration, and produces high-quality
segmentation masks for the regions of interest.

Children join the game one by one, in a random order, and randomly form some
circles of size at least $2$, so that no child is left alone. The game gives
rise to the cyclic decomposition of a random derangement, inducing an
exchangeable random partition. The rate at which the circles are closed varies
in time, and at each time $t$, depends on the number of individuals who have
not played until t. A $\{0,1\}$-valued Markov chain $ X^n$ records the cycle
type of the corresponding random derangement in that any $1$ represents a
hand-grasping event that closes a circle. Using this, we study the cycle counts

spectral types for five of them, ranging from O8 to O9.5, similar to those
derived from radio continuum data, except for two sources that we assigned
somewhat a later spectral type. We included another seven objects with precise
spectral classification from other works, which allowed us to better constrain
the distance estimate. Our spectrophotometric distance d=4.80\,$\pm$\,1.27\,kpc

epidemiological monitoring of case counts and disease prevalence. Taking
specific motivation from ongoing efforts to identify recurrent cases based on

sampling design and estimation methodology. Our approach offers a more
efficient and defensible alternative to traditional capture-recapture (CRC)
methods by leveraging a relatively small random sample of participants whose
recurrence status is obtained through a principled application of medical
records abstraction. This sample is combined with one or more existing
signaling data streams, which may yield data based on arbitrarily
non-representative subsets of the full registry population. The key extension
developed here accounts for the common problem of false positive or negative
diagnostic signals from the existing data stream(s). In particular, we show
that the design only requires documentation of positive signals in these
non-anchor surveillance streams, and permits valid estimation of the true case
count based on an estimable positive predictive value (PPV) parameter. We
borrow ideas from the multiple imputation paradigm to provide accompanying
standard errors, and develop an adapted Bayesian credible interval approach
that yields favorable frequentist coverage properties. We demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed methods through simulation studies, and provide a data

not guaranteed to exist in zero-sum stochastic games when the payoffs at each
state are not convex-concave in the players' actions. A Stackelberg
equilibrium, however, is guaranteed to exist. Consequently, in this paper, we
study zero-sum stochastic Stackelberg games. Going beyond known existence
results for (non-stationary) Stackelberg equilibria, we prove the existence of
recursive (i.e., Markov perfect) Stackelberg equilibria (recSE) in these games,
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a policy profile to be a recSE,

the diabatic error corresponding to exciting the system. We find that this
error is typically reduced when transport is facilitated by using multiple keys
as one may expect from modeling each piano key press as an effective
Landau-Zener process. However, further increasing the number of keys increases
errors; thus, there exists a nontrivial optimal number of keys that minimizes
the diabatic error given a fixed total shuttle time. As we show, this optimal
number of keys can be explained by modeling each key press as an effective
Landau-Zener process while paying careful attention to power-law corrections
that arise due to the nonanalytic behavior of the time-dependent modulation of
the chemical potential at the beginning and end of each key press.

certain distance from an observer, e.g., $>$50m. Far3Det is particularly
important for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which
require detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking
distances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize
this problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance
(50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult,
particularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away
objects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m)
contain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a
""one-size-fits-all"" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near
and far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo
disparities. Both factors lead to an incomplete analysis of the Far3Det task.
For example, while conventional wisdom tells us that high-resolution RGB
sensors should be vital for 3D detection of far-away objects, lidar-based
methods still rank higher compared to RGB counterparts on the current benchmark

non-maximum suppression, which remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art 3D

malware samples in a controlled environment and static analysis extracts
features using reverse engineering tools. While the former faces the challenges
of anti-virtualization and evasive behavior of malware samples, the latter
faces the challenges of code obfuscation. To tackle these drawbacks, prior
works proposed to develop detection models by aggregating dynamic and static
features, thus leveraging the advantages of both approaches. However, simply
concatenating dynamic and static features raises an issue of imbalanced
contribution due to the heterogeneous dimensions of feature vectors to the
performance of malware detection models. Yet, dynamic analysis is a
time-consuming task and requires a secure environment, leading to detection
delays and high costs for maintaining the analysis infrastructure. In this
paper, we first introduce a method of constructing aggregated features via
concatenating latent features learned through deep learning with
equally-contributed dimensions. We then develop a knowledge distillation
technique to transfer knowledge learned from aggregated features by a teacher
model to a student model trained only on static features and use the trained
student model for the detection of new malware samples. We carry out extensive
experiments with a dataset of 86709 samples including both benign and malware

aggregated features constructed by our method outperforms the state-of-the-art

of the first order to approximate fractional integrals and associated

Convolution Quadrature (CQ) which allows for variable steps. In this paper we
analyze the application of the gCQ to fractional integrals, with a focus on the
low regularity case. It is well known that in this situation the original CQ
presents an order reduction close to the singularity. The available theory for
the gCQ does not cover this situation. Here we use a different expression for
the numerical approximation and the associated error, which allows us to
significantly relax the regularity requirements for the application of the gCQ
method. In particular we are able to eliminate the a priori regularization step
required in the original derivation of the gCQ. We show first order of
convergence for a general time mesh under much weaker regularity requirements
than previous results in the literature. We also prove that uniform first order
convergence is achievable for a graded time mesh, which is appropriately
refined close to the singularity, according to the order of the fractional
integral and the regularity of the data. Then we study how to obtain full order
of convergence for the application to linear fractional diffusion equations. An
important advantage of the gCQ method is that it allows for a fast and memory
reduced implementation. We outline how this algorithm can be implemented and
illustrate our theoretical results with several numerical experiments.

handle penalized estimation as well as quasi-maximum likelihood estimation

including the regular experiment that is locally asymptotically mixed normal.
In penalized estimation, depending on the boundary constraint, even the Bridge

Therefore, some sufficient condition for selection consistency is described,
precisely evaluating the balance between the boundary constraint and the form
of the penalty. Examples handled in the paper are: (i) ML estimation of the

moving around the L4 and L5 triangular Lagrangian points of the Sun-Jupiter
system and their distributions can provide important clues to the early
evolution of the Solar System.
  Aims. The number asymmetry of the L4 and L5 Jupiter Trojans is a longstanding
problem. We aim to test a new mechanism in order to explain this anomalous
feature by invoking the jumping-Jupiter scenario.
  Methods. First, we introduce the orbital evolution of Jupiter caused by the
giant planet instability in the early Solar System. In this scenario, Jupiter
could undergo an outward migration at a very high speed. We then investigate
how such a jump changes the numbers of the L4 (N4) and L5 (N5) Trojans.
  Results. The outward migration of Jupiter can distort the co-orbital orbits
near the Lagrangian points, resulting in L4 Trojans being more stable than the
L5 ones. We find that, this mechanism could potentially explain the unbiased
number asymmetry of N4/N5~1.6 for the known Jupiter Trojans. The uncertainties
of the system parameters, e.g. Jupiter's eccentricity and inclination, the
inclination distribution of Jupiter Trojans, are also taken into account and
our results about the L4/L5 asymmetry have been further validated. However, the
resonant amplitudes of the simulated Trojans are excited to higher values
compared to the current population. A possible solution is that collisions
among the Trojans may reduce their resonant amplitudes.

which is in contrast to the asymmetric trend for same sign of interactions.
Further, two types of anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) orderings, namely A-type and
C-type anti-ferromagnetic order, are observed for opposite sign of
interactions. These AFM spin orientations are switched to ferromagnetic (FM)
phase by increasing the applied magnetic field ($B$). However, the spin
ordering changes from the ordered AFM/FM phase to a disordered paramagnetic

Abstract shortened to meet requirements",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We revisit the problem of finding small $\epsilon$-separation keys introduced
by Motwani and Xu (2008). In this problem, the input is $m$-dimensional tuples
$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n $. The goal is to find a small subset of coordinates that
separates at least $(1-\epsilon){n \choose 2}$ pairs of tuples. They provided a
fast algorithm that runs on $\Theta(m/\epsilon)$ tuples sampled uniformly at
random. We show that the sample size can be improved to
$\Theta(m/\sqrt{\epsilon})$. Our algorithm also enjoys a faster running time.
To obtain this result, we provide upper and lower bounds on the sample size to
solve the following decision problem. Given a subset of coordinates $A$, reject
if $A$ separates fewer than $(1-\epsilon){n \choose 2}$ pairs, and accept if
$A$ separates all pairs. The algorithm must be correct with probability at
least $1-\delta$ for all $A$. We show that for algorithms based on sampling:
  - $\Theta(m/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ samples are sufficient and necessary so that
$\delta \leq e^{-m}$ and
  - $\Omega(\sqrt{\frac{\log m}{\epsilon}})$ samples are necessary so that
$\delta$ is a constant.
  Our analysis is based on a constrained version of the balls-into-bins
problem. We believe our analysis may be of independent interest. We also study
a related problem that asks for the following sketching algorithm: with given
parameters $\alpha,k$ and $\epsilon$, the algorithm takes a subset of
coordinates $A$ of size at most $k$ and returns an estimate of the number of
unseparated pairs in $A$ up to a $(1\pm\epsilon)$ factor if it is at least
$\alpha {n \choose 2}$. We show that even for constant $\alpha$ and success
probability, such a sketching algorithm must use $\Omega(mk \log
\epsilon^{-1})$ bits of space; on the other hand, uniform sampling yields a
sketch of size $\Theta(\frac{mk \log m}{\alpha \epsilon^2})$ for this purpose.

flame, with the goal of predicting the response of the reacting flow to
upstream acoustic actuation. Accounting for heat release fluctuations is a
vital component when investigating thermoacoustic instabilities and flame noise
in a linearized framework. Unlike previous studies this work develops and
applies an active flame approach, meaning the heat release oscillations of the
flame resulting from the acoustic fluctuations are taken into account. To yield
an active flame approach in the linear framework, a combustion model needs to
be linearized. It is demonstrated that linearizing Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) combustion models leads to closure
problems, making their application in the linearized framework troublesome.
Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) combustion models, however, prove to
circumvent this problem, which makes them suitable candidates for this purpose.
The RANS combustion models are linearized around the temporal mean flow of the
turbulent jet flame, which is obtained by LES. An a priori analysis shows that
a linearized RANS-Eddy Break Up (EBU) model is the best suited among all
investigated combustion models for the investigated set-up and reproduces with
high accuracy the fluctuations in reaction rate obtained in the LES.
Furthermore, the linearized governing equations of the flow including the
linearized EBU model for the reaction rate are solved for incoming acoustic
perturbations. The response modes show that the reaction rate oscillations are
caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex rings, which perturb the jet flame. The
results are in good agreement with the LES simulations in terms of the mode
shapes of both reaction rate and velocity fluctuations.

human tissues to study the relationship between genetic variation or single

paper, we develop a multi-tissue eQTL analysis that improves the single tissue

tissues. Specifically, we propose an empirical Bayes regression model for
SNP-expression association analysis using data across multiple tissues. To
allow the effects of SNPs to vary greatly among tissues, we use a mixture
distribution as the prior, which is a mixture of a multivariate Gaussian
distribution and a Dirac mass at zero. The model allows us to assess the
cis-SNP gene expression association in each tissue by calculating the Bayes
factors. We show that the proposed estimator of the cis-SNP effects on gene
expression achieves the minimum Bayes risk among all estimators. Analyses of
the GTEx data show that our proposed method is superior to traditional simple
regression methods in terms of predicting accuracy for gene expression levels
using cis-SNPs in testing data sets. Moreover, we find that although genetic
effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes still
vary greatly across tissues.

Rannacher time-stepping. To this end, we construct an orthogonal cubic spline
wavelet basis on the interval satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions and design a wavelet basis on the unit cube using the sparse tensor
product. The method brings the following advantages. First, the number of basis
functions is significantly smaller than for the full grid, which makes it
possible to overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality. Second, some
matrices involved in the computation are identity matrices, which significantly
simplifies and streamlines the algorithm, especially in higher dimensions.
Further, we prove that discretization matrices have uniformly bounded condition

wavelets, the method is higher-order convergent. Numerical experiments are
presented for options on the geometric average.

Non-thermal signatures in mm/sub-mm and gamma-ray bands are useful to probe

cosmic-ray protons accelerated at the termination shock produce high-energy
gamma rays via hadronuclear interaction with the evaporation plasma. This model
can reproduce gamma-ray data in the impulsive phase of a solar flare. We apply

This work aims to better understand the mechanisms by which explanations are
used for in-context learning. We first study the impact of two different
factors on prompting performance when using explanations: the computation trace
(the way the solution is decomposed) and the natural language of the prompt. By
perturbing explanations on three controlled tasks, we show that both factors
contribute to the effectiveness of explanations, indicating that LLMs do
faithfully follow the explanations to some extent. We further study how to form
maximally effective sets of explanations for solving a given test query. We
find that LLMs can benefit from the complementarity of the explanation set as
they are able to fuse different reasoning specified by individual exemplars in
prompts. Additionally, having relevant exemplars also contributes to more
effective prompts. Therefore, we propose a maximal-marginal-relevance-based
exemplar selection approach for constructing exemplar sets that are both
relevant as well as complementary, which successfully improves the in-context

column wall and the column top are computed separately; (3) the model allows
for a non-zero impact velocity at the stellar surface; and (4) the velocity
profile of the gas merges with Newtonian free-fall far from the star. We show
that these extensions allow the new model to simulate sources over a wide range
of accretion rates. The model is based on a rigorous mathematical approach in
which we obtain an exact series solution for the Green's function describing
the reprocessing of monochromatic seed photons. Emergent spectra are then
computed by convolving the Green's function with bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and
blackbody photon sources. The range of the new model is demonstrated via
applications to the high-luminosity source Her X-1, and the low-luminosity

decrease in the surface impact velocity, which increases the $P$d$V$ work done

present a 3D-consistent novel view synthesis approach for monocular portrait
images based on a recent proposed 3D-aware GAN, namely Generative Radiance
Manifolds (GRAM), which has shown strong 3D consistency at multiview image
generation of virtual subjects via the radiance manifolds representation.
However, simply learning an encoder to map a real image into the latent space
of GRAM can only reconstruct coarse radiance manifolds without faithful fine
details, while improving the reconstruction fidelity via instance-specific
optimization is time-consuming. We introduce a novel detail manifolds
reconstructor to learn 3D-consistent fine details on the radiance manifolds
from monocular images, and combine them with the coarse radiance manifolds for
high-fidelity reconstruction. The 3D priors derived from the coarse radiance
manifolds are used to regulate the learned details to ensure reasonable
synthesized results at novel views. Trained on in-the-wild 2D images, our
method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent portrait synthesis largely
outperforming the prior art.

Thus, the data-driven estimator selection problem is becoming increasingly

ongoing processes. Progress bars frequently display nonuniform speed patterns,
such as acceleration and deceleration. However, which progress bar is perceived
faster remain unclear. Methods: We measured the point of subject equality (PSE)
of the constant progress bar toward four different 5-second progress bars with
a non-constant speed. To measure PSE, in each trial, a constant progress bar
and a non-constant progress bar were presented to participants. Participants
needed to judge which one is shorter. Based on their choice, the model
generated the time duration of constant progress bar in next trial. After 40
trials for each non-constant progress bar, the PSE was calculated by the model.
Eye tracking was recorded during the experiment.Results: Our results show that
the constant progress bar and speed-up progress bar are perceived to be faster.
The anchoring effect fits the results of our study, indicating that the final
part of the progress bar is more important for time perception. Moreover, the
eye-tracking results indicate that the progress bar is perceived to be slower
is related to the overload of cognitive resources.Conclusion: The constant
progress bar and speed-up progress bar are perceived as the quickest.
Application: The results suggest that UX design can use constant or speed-up
progress bar, in order to improve user experience in waiting.

atmospheric neutrino data at KamLAND. This constant is a component of the axial
form factor of the neutral-current quasielastic (NCQE) interaction. The value
of $g_A^s$ significantly changes the ratio of proton and neutron NCQE cross
sections. KamLAND is suitable for measuring NCQE interactions as it can detect
nucleon recoils with low-energy thresholds and measure neutron multiplicity
with high efficiency. KamLAND data, including the information on neutron
multiplicity associated with the NCQE interactions, makes it possible to
measure $g_A^s$ with a suppressed dependence on the axial mass $M_A$, which has
not yet been determined. For a comprehensive prediction of the neutron emission
associated with neutrino interactions, we establish a simulation of particle
emission via nuclear deexcitation of $^{12}$C, a process not considered in
existing neutrino Monte Carlo event generators. Energy spectrum fitting for
each neutron multiplicity gives $g_A^s =-0.14^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$, which is the
most stringent limit obtained using NCQE interactions without $M_A$
constraints. The two-body current contribution considered in this analysis
relies on a theoretically effective model and electron scattering experiments

use of slack variables to represent the inequality constraints in the cost

This paper seeks a set of good practices for multi-modal action recognition,
with a particular interest in circumstances where some modalities are not

the model during training (e.g., data augmentation). Second, we investigate on
fusion methods for robustness to missing modalities: we find that
transformer-based fusion shows better robustness for missing modality than
summation or concatenation. Third, we propose a simple modular network,
ActionMAE, which learns missing modality predictive coding by randomly dropping
modality features and tries to reconstruct them with the remaining modality
features. Coupling these good practices, we build a model that is not only
effective in multi-modal action recognition but also robust to modality
missing. Our model achieves the state-of-the-arts on multiple benchmarks and
maintains competitive performances even in missing modality scenarios. Codes

As a result, both the global and local branches can enjoy the merits of mutual

diversity gain, which seriously degrades secrecy performance. Motivated by
this, this work proposes an artificial noise (AN)-aided secure power control
scheme for CF-mMIMO under passive eavesdropping aiming to achieve a higher
secrecy rate and/or guarantee security. In particular, it will be demonstrated
that a careful use of AN signal in the power control is especially important to
improve the secrecy performance. The performance of the proposed power control
scheme is evaluated and compared with various power control schemes via
numerical experiments, which clearly shows that the proposed power control
scheme outperforms all the competing schemes.

  Validation of the Universal Critical Scaling Relations",,,"10.1063/5.0137753",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While undergoing gelation transition, a material passes through a distinctive
state called the critical gel state. In the neighborhood of this critical gel
state, how viscosity, equilibrium modulus, and relaxation times evolve are
correlated by scaling relations, and their universality has been validated for
materials undergoing the sol to gel transition. In this work, we extend this
approach for the gel to sol transition of a thermoresponsive polymeric system
of aqueous Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) gel that passes through the critical
state upon increasing temperature. We observe that, in the neighborhood of the
critical gel state, the equilibrium modulus and viscosity demonstrate a power
law dependence on the relative distance from the critical state in terms of
normalized temperature. Furthermore, the relaxation times in the gel and the
sol state shows symmetric power law divergence near the critical state. The
corresponding critical power law exponents and the dynamic critical exponents
computed at the critical gel to sol transition state validate the scaling and
hyperscaling relations originally proposed for the critical sol to gel
transition very well. Remarkably, the dependence of complex viscosity on
frequency at different temperatures shows a comprehensive mastercurve
irrespective of the temperature ramp rate independently in the gel and the sol
state. This observation demonstrates how the shape of relaxation time spectrum
is independent of both the temperature as well as the ramp rate. Since sol to
gel as well as the gel to sol transitions are opposite to each other, the
applicability of the scaling relations validated in this work suggests broader
symmetry associated with how the structure evolves around the critical state
irrespective of the direction.

Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on full-view

experience lateral beam shifts, beam-shape distortion, and depolarization, and
these effects have a strong dependence on wavelength, incident angle, and

designing and incorporating a transformer-based encoder, much less attention
and vigor have been devoted to transformer-based decoders. For such a task
whose hallmark quest is pixel-accurate prediction, we argue that the decoder
stage is just as crucial as that of the encoder in achieving superior
segmentation performance, by disentangling and refining the high-level cues and
working out object boundaries with pixel-level precision. In this paper, we
propose a novel transformer-based decoder called UperFormer, which is
plug-and-play for hierarchical encoders and attains high quality segmentation
results regardless of encoder architecture. UperFormer is equipped with
carefully designed multi-head skip attention units and novel upsampling
operations. Multi-head skip attention is able to fuse multi-scale features from
backbones with those in decoders. The upsampling operation, which incorporates
feature from encoder, can be more friendly for object localization. It brings a
0.4% to 3.2% increase compared with traditional upsampling methods. By
combining UperFormer with Swin Transformer (Swin-T), a fully transformer-based
symmetric network is formed for semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments show that our proposed approach is highly effective and
computationally efficient. On Cityscapes dataset, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance. On the more challenging ADE20K dataset, our best model yields a
single-scale mIoU of 50.18, and a multi-scale mIoU of 51.8, which is on-par

existing speech synthesis pipelines deployed on GPU are still non-incremental,
which uncovers limitations in high-concurrency scenarios, especially when the

we present a highly efficient approach to perform real-time incremental TTS on

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of
producing high-quality speech with a first-chunk latency lower than 80ms under
100 QPS on a single NVIDIA A10 GPU and significantly outperforms the
non-incremental twin in both concurrency and latency. Our work reveals the

self-attention mechanism has recently attracted more and more attention in the
computer vision community. However, we empirically found that a typical vision
transformer with the spatial self-attention mechanism could not learn accurate
attention maps for distinguishing different categories of fine-grained images.
To address this problem, motivated by the temporal attention mechanism in
brains, we propose a spatial-temporal attention network for learning
fine-grained feature representations, called STAN, where the features learnt by
implementing a sequence of spatial self-attention operations corresponding to
multiple moments are aggregated progressively. The proposed STAN consists of
four modules: a self-attention backbone module for learning a sequence of
features with self-attention operations, a spatial feature self-organizing
module for facilitating the model training, a spatial-temporal feature learning
module for aggregating the re-organized features via a Long Short-Term Memory
network, and a context-aware module that is implemented as the forget block of
the spatial-temporal feature learning module for preserving/forgetting the
long-term memory by utilizing contextual information. Then, we propose a
STAN-based method for open-set fine-grained recognition by integrating the
proposed STAN network with a linear classifier, called STAN-OSFGR. Extensive
experimental results on 3 fine-grained datasets and 2 coarse-grained datasets
demonstrate that the proposed STAN-OSFGR outperforms 9 state-of-the-art
open-set recognition methods significantly in most cases.

guarantees are applicable only when agents have an unlimited budget. This work
focuses on a combinatorial setting, where multiple projects are available for
CC and agents have a limited budget. We study certain specific conditions where
funding can be guaranteed. Further, funding the optimal social welfare subset
of projects is desirable when every available project cannot be funded due to
budget restrictions. We prove the impossibility of achieving optimal welfare at

that the RDN refinement network significantly reduced image blurring and

cooperation in one-shot games. However, recent studies have revealed that the
effectiveness of costly punishment can be diminished by second-order free
riders (i.e., cooperators who never punish defectors) and antisocial punishers
(i.e., defectors who punish cooperators). In a two-stage prisoner's dilemma
game, players not only need to choose between cooperation and defection in the
first stage, but also need to decide whether to punish their opponent in the
second stage. Here, we extend the theory of punishment in one-shot games by
introducing simple bots, who consistently choose prosocial punishment and do
not change their actions over time. We find that this simple extension of the
game allows prosocial punishment to dominate in well-mixed and networked
populations, and that the minimum fraction of bots required for the dominance
of prosocial punishment monotonically increases with increasing dilemma
strength. Furthermore, if humans possess a learning bias toward a ""copy the
majority"" rule or if bots are present at higher degree nodes in scale-free
networks, the fully dominance of prosocial punishment is still possible at a
high dilemma strength. These results indicate that introducing bots can be a
significant factor in establishing prosocial punishment. We therefore, provide
a novel explanation for the evolution of prosocial punishment, and note that
the contrasting results that emerge from the introduction of different types of
bots also imply that the design of the bots matters.

effectual way to understand real-world physics processes. For complex physics
systems, analytical solutions are not available and numerical solutions are
widely-used. However, traditional numerical algorithms are computationally
expensive and challenging in handling multiphysics systems. Recently, using
neural networks to solve PDEs has made significant progress, called
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs encode physical laws into
neural networks and learn the continuous solutions of PDEs. For the training of
PINNs, existing methods suffer from the problems of inefficiency and unstable
convergence, since the PDE residuals require calculating automatic
differentiation. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Mesh-based Importance
Sampling (DMIS) to tackle these problems. DMIS is a novel sampling scheme based
on importance sampling, which constructs a dynamic triangular mesh to estimate
sample weights efficiently. DMIS has broad applicability and can be easily
integrated into existing methods. The evaluation of DMIS on three widely-used
benchmarks shows that DMIS improves the convergence speed and accuracy in the
meantime. Especially in solving the highly nonlinear Schr\""odinger Equation,
compared with state-of-the-art methods, DMIS shows up to 46% smaller root mean

an electric field directed tangentially to the unperturbed boundary is
investigated numerically. Within the framework of the strong field model, when
the effects of capillarity and gravity are not taken into account, it is shown
that nonlinear surface waves have a tendency to break. In result of the
collapse of the surface waves, the curvature of the boundary and the gradient
of the local electric field undergo infinite discontinuity on the surface of
the liquid. The angles of the boundary inclination remain small. The
characteristic collapse time of a surface wave traveling in a given direction
is calculated versus the dielectric constant of the liquid. It is shown that
the time of the singularity formation increases infinitely at small and high
values of the dielectric constant. The first case corresponds to the transition
of the system to the neutral stability regime (the jump in electrostatic
pressure at the boundary turns into zero). At high values of the dielectric
constant of the liquid, the collapse time also increases. This effect is
associated with the realization of a special regime of fluid motion, in which
the propagation of nonlinear surface waves of an arbitrary configuration occurs
without distortions. For the liquids with relative permittivity close to five,
the wave breaking time reaches a minimum, i.e., the collapse of the surface
waves for such liquids occurs most intensively.

where gravitational collapse occurs which could lead to PBH formation, and the
smaller one is where the velocity dispersion develops due to nonlinear
interactions. We estimate the effect of the velocity dispersion on the PBH
formation by comparing the free-fall timescale and the timescale for a particle
to cross the collapsing region. As a demonstration, we consider a log-normal
power spectrum for the initial density perturbation with the peak value
$\sigma_0^2$ at a scale that corresponds to the larger scale. We find that the

MMS, for agents of equal entitlement, and anyprice share, APS, for agents of
arbitrary entitlement). Aziz, Li and Wu (2022) designed picking sequences that
improve this ratio to $\frac{5}{3}$ for the case of equal entitlement. We
design picking sequences that improve the ratio to~1.733 for the case of

consider two different information feedback models, with full and partial

(1) For general problems, we show that our algorithm gets an $\widetilde
O(T^{\alpha_u} + T^{\alpha_v} + T^{1/2})$ regret against the fluid benchmark.

3 -- 8 $\times 10^4$ years. We also have estimated the distributions of the

artificially increasing the lifetimes of large sunspots in an area evolution

sophisticated interactions among their components. Such interactions may result
in potential attack vectors in terms of side channels, possibly available to
user-land exploits to leak secret data. Exploitation and countering of such
side channels require a detailed understanding of the target component.
However, such detailed information is commonly unpublished for many CPUs.
  In this paper, we introduce the concept of Leakage Templates to abstractly
describe specific side channels and identify their occurrences in binary
applications. We design and implement Plumber, a framework to derive the
generic Leakage Templates from individual code sequences that are known to
cause leakage (e.g., found by prior work). Plumber uses a combination of
instruction fuzzing, instructions' operand mutation and statistical analysis to
explore undocumented behavior of microarchitectural optimizations and derive
sufficient conditions on vulnerable code inputs that, if hold can trigger a
distinguishing behavior. Using Plumber we identified novel leakage primitives
based on Leakage Templates (for ARM Cortex-A53 and -A72 cores), in particular
related to previction (a new premature cache eviction), and prefetching
behavior. We show the utility of Leakage Templates by re-identifying a
prefetcher-based vulnerability in OpenSSL 1.1.0g first reported by Shin et al.

  Approach and Lessons for the Future","under peer-review; contains 3 Tables",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As ChatGPT et al. conquer the world, the optimal liability framework for AI
systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. In a much-anticipated
move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European
approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive and
a revision of the Product Liability Directive. They constitute the final
cornerstone of EU AI regulation. Crucially, the liability proposals and the EU
AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual
rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on
AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a
Brussels Effect in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and
beyond.
  This paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the
Commission proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction,
they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI
liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms
and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and
causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments, which are collected
in an Annex at the end of the paper. Third, based on an analysis of the key
risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of
AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. This includes: a
comprehensive framework for AI liability; provisions to support innovation; an
extension to non-discrimination/algorithmic fairness, as well as explainable
AI; and sustainability. I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via
sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects
in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI
and XAI, but potentially also sustainable AI (SAI).

that is often ignored. Suggested methods are typically only approximate or make
strong assumptions of Gaussianity of the shear field. Probabilistic sampling
methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), draw samples form a
probability distribution, allowing for full and flexible uncertainty
quantification, however these methods are notoriously slow and struggle in the
high-dimensional parameter spaces of imaging problems. In this work we use, for
the first time, a trans-dimensional MCMC sampler for mass-mapping, promoting
sparsity in a wavelet basis. This sampler gradually grows the parameter space
as required by the data, exploiting the extremely sparse nature of mass maps in
wavelet space. The wavelet coefficients are arranged in a tree-like structure,
which adds finer scale detail as the parameter space grows. We demonstrate the
trans-dimensional sampler on galaxy cluster-scale images where the planar
modelling approximation is valid. In high-resolution experiments, this method
produces naturally parsimonious solutions, requiring less than 1% of the
potential maximum number of wavelet coefficients and still producing a good fit
to the observed data. In the presence of noisy data, trans-dimensional MCMC
produces a better reconstruction of mass-maps than the standard smoothed
Kaiser-Squires method, with the addition that uncertainties are fully
quantified. This opens up the possibility for new mass maps and inferences
about the nature of dark matter using the new high-resolution data from
upcoming weak lensing surveys such as Euclid.

around this contested issue. Facebook is a dominant social media platform known
to be a major source of information and online influence, yet discussion of
climate change on the platform has remained largely unstudied due to
difficulties in accessing data. This paper utilises Facebook's repository of
social/political ads to study how climate change is framed as an issue in
adverts placed by different actors. Sponsored content is a strategic investment
and presumably intended to be persuasive, so patterns of who pays for adverts
and how those adverts frame the issue can reveal large-scale trends in public
discourse. We show that most money spent on climate-related messaging is
targeted at users in the US, GB and CA. While the number of advert impressions
correlates with total spend by an actor, there is a secondary effect of unpaid
social sharing which can substantially affect the number of impressions per
dollar spent. Most spend in the US is by political actors, while environmental
non-governmental organisations dominate spend in GB. Analysis shows that
climate change solutions are well represented in GB, while climate change
impacts such as extreme weather events are strongly represented in the US and
CA. Different actor types frame the issue of climate change in different ways;
political actors position the issue as party political and a point of
difference between candidates, whereas environmental NGOs frame climate change
as the focus of collective action and social mobilisation. Overall, our study
provides a first empirical exploration of climate-related advertising on
Facebook. It shows the diversity of actors seeking to use Facebook as a
platform for their campaigns and how they utilise different topic frames to
persuade users to act.

algorithmic monoculture: the same systems, or systems that share components
(e.g. training data), are deployed by multiple decision-makers. While sharing
offers clear advantages (e.g. amortizing costs), does it bear risks? We
introduce and formalize one such risk, outcome homogenization: the extent to
which particular individuals or groups experience negative outcomes from all
decision-makers. If the same individuals or groups exclusively experience
undesirable outcomes, this may institutionalize systemic exclusion and
reinscribe social hierarchy. To relate algorithmic monoculture and outcome
homogenization, we propose the component-sharing hypothesis: if decision-makers
share components like training data or specific models, then they will produce
more homogeneous outcomes. We test this hypothesis on algorithmic fairness
benchmarks, demonstrating that sharing training data reliably exacerbates
homogenization, with individual-level effects generally exceeding group-level
effects. Further, given the dominant paradigm in AI of foundation models, i.e.
models that can be adapted for myriad downstream tasks, we test whether model
sharing homogenizes outcomes across tasks. We observe mixed results: we find
that for both vision and language settings, the specific methods for adapting a
foundation model significantly influence the degree of outcome homogenization.
We conclude with philosophical analyses of and societal challenges for outcome
homogenization, with an eye towards implications for deployed machine learning

availability. To address these challenges, we propose a framework named
Federated Graph-based Sampling (FedGS), to stabilize the global model update
and mitigate the long-term bias given arbitrary client availability
simultaneously. First, we model the data correlations of clients with a
Data-Distribution-Dependency Graph (3DG) that helps keep the sampled clients
data apart from each other, which is theoretically shown to improve the
approximation to the optimal model update. Second, constrained by the
far-distance in data distribution of the sampled clients, we further minimize
the variance of the numbers of times that the clients are sampled, to mitigate
long-term bias. To validate the effectiveness of FedGS, we conduct experiments
on three datasets under a comprehensive set of seven client availability modes.
Our experimental results confirm FedGS's advantage in both enabling a fair
client-sampling scheme and improving the model performance under arbitrary
client availability. Our code is available at

data. However, collecting and annotating data on a large scale is often costly
and time-consuming, which severely hinders the application of DNNs. To address
this issue, we explore a new task, termed as dataset expansion, which seeks to
expand a ready-to-use small dataset by automatically creating new labeled
samples. To this end, we present a Guided Imagination Framework (GIF) that
leverages cutting-edge generative models (e.g., DALL-E2, Stable Diffusion (SD))
to ``imagine'' and create informative new data from the input seed data.
Specifically, GIF conducts data imagination by optimizing the latent features
of the seed data in the semantically meaningful space of the prior model, which
are used to create photo-realistic images with new content. To guide the
imagination towards creating informative samples for model training, we
introduce two key criteria, i.e., class-maintained information boosting and
sample diversity promotion. The two criteria are verified to be essential for
effective dataset expansion: GIF-SD obtains 13.5\% higher model accuracy on
natural image datasets than unguided expansion with SD. With these essential
criteria, GIF expands datasets effectively in various small-data scenarios,
boosting model accuracy by 36.9\% on average over six natural image datasets
and by 13.5\% on average over three medical datasets. The source code will be

  without Concrete Text Labels","Accepted by AAAI23",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have recently shown superior
performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification and
segmentation. However, in fine-grained image re-identification (ReID), the
labels are indexes, lacking concrete text descriptions. Therefore, it remains
to be determined how such models could be applied to these tasks. This paper
first finds out that simply fine-tuning the visual model initialized by the
image encoder in CLIP, has already obtained competitive performances in various
ReID tasks. Then we propose a two-stage strategy to facilitate a better visual
representation. The key idea is to fully exploit the cross-modal description
ability in CLIP through a set of learnable text tokens for each ID and give
them to the text encoder to form ambiguous descriptions. In the first training
stage, image and text encoders from CLIP keep fixed, and only the text tokens
are optimized from scratch by the contrastive loss computed within a batch. In
the second stage, the ID-specific text tokens and their encoder become static,
providing constraints for fine-tuning the image encoder. With the help of the
designed loss in the downstream task, the image encoder is able to represent
data as vectors in the feature embedding accurately. The effectiveness of the
proposed strategy is validated on several datasets for the person or vehicle
ReID tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Syliz517/CLIP-ReID.

often require large-scale datasets and considerable computational resources,
which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and environmentally
unfriendly. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training
model for molecular representation learning, Bi-branch Masked Graph Transformer
Autoencoder (BatmanNet). BatmanNet features two tailored and complementary
graph autoencoders to reconstruct the missing nodes and edges from a masked
molecular graph. To our surprise, BatmanNet discovered that the highly masked
proportion (60%) of the atoms and bonds achieved the best performance. We
further propose an asymmetric graph-based encoder-decoder architecture for
either nodes and edges, where a transformer-based encoder only takes the
visible subset of nodes or edges, and a lightweight decoder reconstructs the
original molecule from the latent representation and mask tokens. With this
simple yet effective asymmetrical design, our BatmanNet can learn efficiently
even from a much smaller-scale unlabeled molecular dataset to capture the
underlying structural and semantic information, overcoming a major limitation
of current deep neural networks for molecular representation learning. For
instance, using only 250K unlabelled molecules as pre-training data, our
BatmanNet with 2.575M parameters achieves a 0.5% improvement on the average AUC

resistivity is observed below about 30 K, which coincides with the sign change

models using the current constraint on the gravitational wave (GW) propagation
speed coming from the binary neutron star GW170817 detection by LIGO-Virgo

density profile of the galactic halo. We constrain the parameter space for
these models using the bounds coming from GW speed measurement and the Milky

sensitivity, the three models considered here remain unconstrained. A
meaningful constraint can only be obtained for detection frequencies $\leq
10^{-9}$ Hz, which falls in the detection range of radio telescopes such as

round-the-clock working hours. However, due to the lack of frequent
communication and coordination in GSD, the planning and managing of the
requirements change process becomes a challenging task. As in DevOps,
requirements are not only shaped by development feedback but also by the
operations team. This means requirements affect development, development
affects operations and operations affect requirements. However, DevOps in GSD
still faces many challenges in terms of requirement management. The purpose of
this research project is to develop a DevOps requirement change management and
implementation maturity model (DevOps-RCMIMM) that could assist the GSD
organizations in modifying and improving their requirement management process
in the DevOps process. The development of DevOps-RCMIMM will be based on the
existing DevOps and RCM literature, industrial empirical study, and
understanding of factors that could impact the implementation of the DevOps
requirement change management process in the domain of GSD. This vision study
presents the initial results of a systematic literature review that will
contribute to the development of maturity levels of the proposed DevOps-RCMIMM.

to mid-infrared regime, to morphologically analyze the nuclear star cluster
(NSC) of NGC 628, a grand-design spiral galaxy. The cluster is located in a 200
pc x 400 pc cavity, lacking both dust and gas. We find roughly constant values
for the effective radius (r_eff ~ 5 pc) and ellipticity ({\epsilon} ~ 0.05),
while the S\'ersic index (n) and position angle (PA) drop from n ~ 3 to ~ 2 and
PA ~ 130{\deg} to 90{\deg}, respectively. In the mid-infrared, r_eff ~ 12pc,
{\epsilon} ~ 0.4, and n ~ 1-1.5, with the same PA ~ 90{\deg}. The NSC has a
stellar mass of log10 (M_nsc / M_Sun) = 7.06 +- 0.31, as derived through B-V,
confirmed when using multi-wavelength data, and in agreement with the
literature value. Fitting the spectral energy distribution, excluding the
mid-infrared data, yields a main stellar population's age of (8 +- 3) Gyr with
a metallicity of Z = 0.012 +- 0.006. There is no indication of any significant
star formation over the last few Gyr. Whether gas and dust were dynamically
kept out or evacuated from the central cavity remains unclear. The best-fit
suggests an excess of flux in the mid-infrared bands, with further indications
that the center of the mid-infrared structure is displaced with respect to the
optical center of the NSC. We discuss five potential scenarios, none of them
fully explaining both the observed photometry and structure.

principles of quantum mechanics is a common challenge in physics, chemistry,

for solving condensed matter and chemistry problems, while for atomic nuclei it
is still quite challenging because of the complicated nucleon-nucleon
interactions, which strongly couple the spatial, spin, and isospin degrees of
freedom. By combining essential physics of the nuclear wave functions and the
strong expressive power of artificial neural networks, we develop FeynmanNet, a
deep-learning variational quantum Monte Carlo approach for \emph{ab initio}
nuclear structure. We show that FeynmanNet can provide very accurate solutions
of ground-state energies and wave functions for $^4$He, $^6$Li, and even up to
$^{16}$O as emerging from the leading-order and next-to-leading-order
Hamiltonians of pionless effective field theory. Compared to the conventional
diffusion Monte Carlo approaches, which suffer from the severe inherent
fermion-sign problem, FeynmanNet reaches such a high accuracy in a variational
way and scales polynomially with the number of nucleons. Therefore, it paves
the way to a highly accurate and efficient \emph{ab initio} method for
predicting nuclear properties based on the realistic interactions between
nucleons.

Our CoMFormer outperforms all the existing baselines by forgetting less old

report an extensive evaluation in the large-scale continual semantic

assistive robot teleoperation, seek to model and help human users with limited
ability in a fixed task. However, these approaches often fail to account for
humans' ability to adapt and eventually learn how to execute a control task
themselves. Furthermore, in applications where it may be desirable for a human
to intervene, these methods may inhibit their ability to learn how to succeed
with full self-control. In this paper, we focus on the problem of assistive
teaching of motor control tasks such as parking a car or landing an aircraft.
Despite their ubiquitous role in humans' daily activities and occupations,
motor tasks are rarely taught in a uniform way due to their high complexity and
variance. We propose an AI-assisted teaching algorithm that leverages skill
discovery methods from reinforcement learning (RL) to (i) break down any motor
control task into teachable skills, (ii) construct novel drill sequences, and
(iii) individualize curricula to students with different capabilities. Through
an extensive mix of synthetic and user studies on two motor control tasks --
parking a car with a joystick and writing characters from the Balinese alphabet
-- we show that assisted teaching with skills improves student performance by
around 40% compared to practicing full trajectories without skills, and
practicing with individualized drills can result in up to 25% further
improvement. Our source code is available at

scattering approach for noninvasive probes, the first- and second-order
conductance corrections caused by the tip potential disturbance are expressed
explicitly in terms of the scattering states of the unperturbed structure.
Numerical calculations confirm the perturbative results, showing that the
second-order term prevails in the conductance plateaus, exhibiting a universal
scaling law for armchair graphene strips. For stronger tips, at specific probe
potential widths and strengths beyond the perturbative regime, the conductance
corrections reveal the appearance of resonances originated from states trapped
below the tip. The zero-transverse-energy mode of an armchair metallic strip is
shown to be insensitive to the long-range electrostatic potential of the probe.
For nanoconstrictions defined on a strip, scanning gate microscopy allows to
get insight into the breakdown of conductance quantization. The first-order
correction generically dominates at low tip strength, while for Fermi energies
associated with faint conductance plateaus, the second-order correction becomes
dominant for relatively small potential tip strengths. In accordance with the
spatial dependence of the partial local density of states, the largest tip
effect occurs in the central part of the constriction, close to the edges.
Nanoribbons and nanoconstrictions with zigzag edges exhibit a similar response
as in the case of armchair nanostructures, except when the intervalley coupling
induced by the tip potential destroys the chiral edge states.

main components: feature extraction, motion estimation, and image synthesis.
Existing approaches are mainly distinguishable in terms of how these modules
are designed. However, when interpolating high-resolution images, e.g. at 4K,
the design choices for achieving high accuracy within reasonable memory
requirements are limited. The feature extraction layers help to compress the
input and extract relevant information for the latter stages, such as motion
estimation. However, these layers are often costly in parameters, computation
time, and memory. We show how ideas from dimensionality reduction combined with
a lightweight optimization can be used to compress the input representation
while keeping the extracted information suitable for frame interpolation.
Further, we require neither a pretrained flow network nor a synthesis network,
additionally reducing the number of trainable parameters and required memory.
When evaluating on three 4K benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art image
quality among the methods without pretrained flow while having the lowest

broadening of high-energy (typically more than 100 uJ) pulses has only been
realized in complex setups, i.e., in large and costly, pressure-controlled
vacuum chambers to avoid strong focusing, ionization, and damage on the
mirrors. Here, we present spectral broadening of 2 mJ pulses in a simple and
compact (60 cm long) multi-pass cell operated in ambient air. Instead of the
traditional Herriott cell with concave-concave (CC/CC) mirrors, we use a
convex-concave (CX/CC) design, where the beam stays large at all times allowing
both to minimize damage and operate in ambient air. We demonstrate spectral
broadening of 2.1 mJ pulses at 100 kHz repetition rate (200 W of average power)
from 2.1 nm (pulse duration of 670 fs) to a spectral bandwidth of 24.5 nm,
supporting 133 fs pulses with 96% transmission efficiency. We show the
compressibility of these pulses down to 134 fs, and verify that the spectral
homogeneity of the beam is similar to previously reported CC/CC designs. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a CX/CC MPC compressor,
operated at high pulse energies in air. Because of its simplicity, small

midrapidity ($|y| < $ 0.5) as a function of collision centrality using the
ALICE detector. The $p_{\rm T}$-integrated yields, the coalescence parameters
and the ratios to protons are reported and compared with nucleosynthesis
models. The comparison of these results in different collision systems at
different centre-of-mass collision energies reveals a suppression of nucleus
production in small systems. In the Statistical Hadronisation Model framework,
this can be explained by a small correlation volume where the baryon number is
conserved, as already shown in previous fluctuation analyses. However, a
different size of the correlation volume is required to describe the proton
yields in the same data sets. The coalescence model can describe this
suppression by the fact that the wave functions of the nuclei are large and the
fireball size starts to become comparable and even much smaller than the actual
nucleus at low multiplicities.

learn the deblurring of different regions and recover realistic details. We

particle within the EFT of spinning gravitating objects, through which we
derive and establish the new precision frontier at the fifth PN (5PN) order.
This frontier includes higher-spin sectors, quadratic and quartic in the spin,
which both display novel physical features, due to the extension of the
effective theory beyond linear order in the curvature. The quadratic-in-spin
sectors give rise to a new tidal effect, and the quartic-in-spin sectors
exhibit a new multipolar deformation. We then generalize the concept of tidal
operators and of spin-induced multipolar operators, and make conjectures on the
numerical values of their Wilson coefficients, and on the effective
point-particle action of Kerr black holes. We confirm the generalized actions
for generic compact binaries of the NLO quartic-in-spin sectors which were
derived via the extension of the EFT of gravitating spinning objects. We first
present the corresponding interaction potentials and general Hamiltonians,
which consist of 12 distinct sectors, with a new one due to the new multipolar
deformation. These Hamiltonians give the full physical information on the
binary system, which mostly gets lost in higher-spin sectors, when going to the
aligned-spins configuration. Moreover these general Hamiltonians uniquely allow
us to find the complete Poincar\'e algebra at the 5PN order with spins,
including the third subleading quadratic-in-spin sectors. We derive consequent
observables for GW applications. Finally, to make contact with the scattering
problem, we also derive the extrapolated scattering angles for aligned spins.
Our completion of the Poincar\'e algebra provides the strongest validation of
our most comprehensive new results, and thus that the 5PN order has now been

the goal is to find the 3D motion of a scene from its consecutive observations.
Recently, there have been efforts to compute the scene flow from 3D point
clouds. A common approach is to train a regression model that consumes source
and target point clouds and outputs the per-point translation vector. An
alternative is to learn point matches between the point clouds concurrently
with regressing a refinement of the initial correspondence flow. In both cases,
the learning task is very challenging since the flow regression is done in the
free 3D space, and a typical solution is to resort to a large annotated
synthetic dataset. We introduce SCOOP, a new method for scene flow estimation
that can be learned on a small amount of data without employing ground-truth
flow supervision. In contrast to previous work, we train a pure correspondence
model focused on learning point feature representation and initialize the flow
as the difference between a source point and its softly corresponding target
point. Then, in the run-time phase, we directly optimize a flow refinement
component with a self-supervised objective, which leads to a coherent and
accurate flow field between the point clouds. Experiments on widespread
datasets demonstrate the performance gains achieved by our method compared to
existing leading techniques while using a fraction of the training data. Our

adapt to recognizable patterns in the estimation error. In this paper, we show
that the regret minimization problem for finite horizon estimation can be cast
into a simple convex optimization problem. For this purpose, we first rewrite
linear time-varying system dynamics using a novel system level synthesis

  an ab initio study",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent experiments have shown that the out-of-plane dielectric constant of
water confined in nanoslits of graphite and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is
vanishingly small. Despite extensive effort based mainly on classical
force-field molecular dynamics (FFMD) approaches, the origin of this phenomenon
is under debate. Here we used ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD)
and AIMD-trained machine learning potentials to explore the structure and
electronic properties of water confined inside graphene and hBN slits. We found
that the reduced dielectric constant arises mainly from the anti-parallel
alignment of the water dipoles in the perpendicular direction to the surface in
the first two water layers near the solid interface. Although the water
molecules retain liquid-like mobility, the interfacial layers exhibit a net
ferroelectric ordering and constrained hydrogen-bonding orientations which lead
to much reduced polarization fluctuations in the out-of-plane direction at room
temperature. Importantly, we show that this effect is independent of the
distance between the two confining surfaces of the slit, and it originates in
the spontaneous polarization of interfacial water. Our calculations also show
no significant variations in the structure and polarization of water near
graphene and hBN, despite their different electronic structures. These results
are important as they offer new insight into a property of water that plays a
critical role in the long-range interactions between surfaces, the electric
double-layer formation, ion solvation and transport, as well as biomolecular
functioning.

Because errors in transmon-based quantum computers appear biasedly as Z type

type errors. Even though these surface codes have been suggested for lattice
structures, since transmons-based quantum computers, developed by IBM, have a

the non-equilibrium description of thermodynamic laws. The comparison between
the law of emergence in both cases shows that the law of emergence from the
non-equilibrium approach describes the expansion of the universe in terms of
the areal volume, unlike the effective volume in the equilibrium case. We have
further shown that the law of emergence also satisfies the condition of the
maximization of entropy for a de Sitter universe; thus, the entropy of the

in such networks is almost always stochastic, fluctuations in the production
are unavoidable. In this paper, we study the effect of fluctuations on the
resource dependencies in complex networks. To this end, we consider a
modification of a threshold model of resource dependencies in networks that was
recently proposed, where each vertex has a fitness that depends on the total
amount of resource it has produced, the amount it has procured from its
neighbours, and the fitness threshold. We study how the ``network fitness'',
defined as the average fitness of vertices in the network, is affected as the
fluctuation size is varied. We show that the fluctuations worsen the network
fitness even when average production on vertices is kept fixed. This is true
independent of whether more than required amount is produced in the network or
not. However, this effect saturates for large fluctuations, and hence very
large fluctuations cannot worsen the network fitness beyond a limit. We further
show that the networks with a homogeneous degree distribution, such as the
Erdos-Renyi network, are less affected by fluctuations and also produce lower
wastage than the networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution like the
Scale-Free network. Our work shows that fluctuations in the resource production
should be avoided in resource dependency networks.

longitudinal component of the magnetic field by applying the weak field
approximation. In this paper, we aim at improving our understanding of the
diagnostic capabilities of these lines by studying the emergent Stokes profiles
resulting from radiative transfer calculations in a radiative
magneto-hydrodynamic (rMHD) time-dependent model representative of a solar
plage. To this end, we create a synthetic observation with temporal and spatial
resolutions similar to those of CLASP2. We find strong asymmetries in the
circular polarization synthetic profiles which considerably complicate the
application of the weak field approximation. We demonstrate that the selective
application of the weak field approximation to fit different spectral regions
in the profile allows to retrieve information about the longitudinal component
of the magnetic field at different regions of the model atmosphere, even when
the circular polarization profiles are not anti-symmetric and are formed in the
presence of strong velocity and magnetic field gradients.

the computation-intensive workloads from low-end devices to a powerful edge
server for video analytics, but the device-server communications will remain a
bottleneck due to the limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a task-oriented
communication framework for edge video analytics, where multiple devices
collect the visual sensory data and transmit the informative features to an
edge server for processing. To enable low-latency inference, this framework
removes video redundancy in spatial and temporal domains and transmits minimal
information that is essential for the downstream task, rather than
reconstructing the videos at the edge server. Specifically, it extracts compact
task-relevant features based on the deterministic information bottleneck (IB)
principle, which characterizes a tradeoff between the informativeness of the
features and the communication cost. As the features of consecutive frames are
temporally correlated, we propose a temporal entropy model (TEM) to reduce the
bitrate by taking the previous features as side information in feature
encoding. To further improve the inference performance, we build a
spatial-temporal fusion module at the server to integrate features of the
current and previous frames for joint inference. Extensive experiments on video
analytics tasks evidence that the proposed framework effectively encodes
task-relevant information of video data and achieves a better rate-performance
tradeoff than existing methods.

restricted in this setting as they estimate garment warping flows mainly based
on 2D poses and appearance, which omits the geometric prior of the 3D human
body shape. Moreover, current garment warping methods are confined to localized
regions, which makes them ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies and
results in inferior flows with artifacts. To tackle these issues, we present
3D-aware global correspondences, which are reliable flows that jointly encode
global semantic correlations, local deformations, and geometric priors of 3D
human bodies. Particularly, given an image pair depicting the source and target
person, (a) we first obtain their pose-aware and high-level representations via
two encoders, and introduce a coarse-to-fine decoder with multiple refinement
modules to predict the pixel-wise global correspondence. (b) 3D parametric
human models inferred from images are incorporated as priors to regularize the
correspondence refinement process so that our flows can be 3D-aware and better
handle variations of pose and viewpoint. (c) Finally, an adversarial generator
takes the garment warped by the 3D-aware flow, and the image of the target
person as inputs, to synthesize the photo-realistic try-on result. Extensive
experiments on public benchmarks and our HardPose test set demonstrate the
superiority of our method against the SOTA try-on approaches.

actions of various durations and complex content. Given limited GPU memory,
training TAL end to end (i.e., from videos to predictions) on long videos is a
significant challenge. Most methods can only train on pre-extracted features
without optimizing them for the localization problem, consequently limiting
localization performance. In this work, to extend the potential in TAL
networks, we propose a novel end-to-end method Re2TAL, which rewires pretrained
video backbones for reversible TAL. Re2TAL builds a backbone with reversible
modules, where the input can be recovered from the output such that the bulky
intermediate activations can be cleared from memory during training. Instead of
designing one single type of reversible module, we propose a network rewiring
mechanism, to transform any module with a residual connection to a reversible
module without changing any parameters. This provides two benefits: (1) a large
variety of reversible networks are easily obtained from existing and even
future model designs, and (2) the reversible models require much less training
effort as they reuse the pre-trained parameters of their original
non-reversible versions. Re2TAL, only using the RGB modality, reaches 37.01%
average mAP on ActivityNet-v1.3, a new state-of-the-art record, and mAP 64.9%

challenges, as their vision sensors are required to transmit vast amounts of

approach to reduce data transmission is to use event-based vision sensors,
whose pixels produce events only when there are changes in the input. However,
even for event-based vision, transmission and processing of visual data can be
quite onerous. Currently, these challenges are solved by using high-speed
communication links and powerful machine vision processing hardware. But if
resources are limited, instead of processing all the sensory information in
parallel, an effective strategy is to divide the visual field into several
small sub-regions, choose the region of highest saliency, process it, and shift
serially the focus of attention to regions of decreasing saliency. This
strategy, commonly used also by the visual system of many animals, is typically
referred to as ``selective attention''. Here we present a digital architecture

tasks an analyst can perform with reasonable accuracy, which makes it
challenging to deploy in practice. This can be alleviated by private sketching,
where the dataset is compressed into a single noisy sketch vector which can be
shared with the analysts and used to perform arbitrarily many analyses.
However, the algorithms to perform specific tasks from sketches must be
developed on a case-by-case basis, which is a major impediment to their use. In
this paper, we introduce the generic moment-to-moment (M$^2$M) method to
perform a wide range of data exploration tasks from a single private sketch.
Among other things, this method can be used to estimate empirical moments of
attributes, the covariance matrix, counting queries (including histograms), and
regression models. Our method treats the sketching mechanism as a black-box
operation, and can thus be applied to a wide variety of sketches from the
literature, widening their ranges of applications without further engineering
or privacy loss, and removing some of the technical barriers to the wider
adoption of sketches for data exploration under differential privacy. We
validate our method with data exploration tasks on artificial and real-world

twinning systems. Understandings on dislocation cores and twin interfaces are
currently not complete or quantitative, despite extensive experimental and

properties in both HCP and BCC Ti using a Deep Potential (DP) and DFT. We
determine the core structures, critical resolved shear stresses and mobilities
of <a>, <c+a>, <c> dislocations in HCP and <111>/2 dislocations in BCC Ti. The
<a> slip consists of slow core migration on pyramidal-I planes and fast
migration on prism-planes, and is kinetically limited by cross-slips among
them. This behaviour is consistent with ""locking-unlocking"" phenomena in TEM
and is likely an intrinsic property. Large-scale DFT calculations provide a
peek at the screw <c+a> core and glide behaviour, which is further quantified
using DP-Ti. The screw <c+a> is unstable on pyramidal-II planes. The mixed
<c+a> is nearly sessile on pyramidal-I planes, consistent with observations of
long dislocations in this orientation. The edge and mixed <c+a> are unstable
against a pyramidal-to-basal (PB) transition and become sessile at high
temperatures, corroborate the difficulties in <c>-axis compression of Ti.
Finally, in BCC Ti, the <111>/2 screw has a degenerate core with average glide
on {112} planes; the <111>/2 edge and mixed dislocations have non-dissociated
cores on {110} planes. This work paints a self-consistent, complete picture on
all dislocations in Ti, rationalises previous experimental observations and
points to future HRTEM examinations of unusual dislocations such as the mixed

Gkenosis et al. (ESA 2018): We are given $n$ tests. Each test $j$ can be
conducted at cost $c_j$, and it succeeds independently with probability $p_j$.
Further, a partition of the (integer) interval $\{0,\dots,n\}$ into $B$ smaller
intervals is known. The goal is to conduct tests so as to determine that
interval from the partition in which the number of successful tests lies while
minimizing the expected cost. Ghuge et al. (IPCO 2022) recently showed that a
polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm exists.
  We show that interweaving the two strategies that order tests increasingly by
their $c_j/p_j$ and $c_j/(1-p_j)$ ratios, respectively, -- as already proposed
by Gkensosis et al. for a special case -- yields a small approximation ratio.
We also show that the approximation ratio can be slightly decreased from $6$ to
$3+2\sqrt{2}\approx 5.828$ by adding in a third strategy that simply orders
tests increasingly by their costs. The similar analyses for both algorithms are
nontrivial but arguably clean. Finally, we complement the implied upper bound
of $3+2\sqrt{2}$ on the adaptivity gap with a lower bound of $3/2$. Since the
lower-bound instance is a so-called unit-cost $k$-of-$n$ instance, we settle
the adaptivity gap in this case.

vanishes and prove that the nonzero polynomial factorizes into smaller skew

$\text{hs}_{\lambda/\mu}(1,\omega^d,\dots,\omega^{d(tn-1)}/1,\omega^d,\dots,\omega^{d(tm-1)})$,
for all divisors $d$ of $t$, in terms of ribbon supertableaux. Lastly, we use

neurodegenerative dementia. Behavioral alterations and cognitive impairments
are found in the clinical courses of both diseases and their differential
diagnosis is sometimes difficult for physicians. Therefore, an accurate tool
dedicated to this diagnostic challenge can be valuable in clinical practice.
However, current structural imaging methods mainly focus on the detection of
each disease but rarely on their differential diagnosis. In this paper, we
propose a deep learning based approach for both problems of disease detection
and differential diagnosis. We suggest utilizing two types of biomarkers for
this application: structure grading and structure atrophy. First, we propose to
train a large ensemble of 3D U-Nets to locally determine the anatomical
patterns of healthy people, patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with
Frontotemporal dementia using structural MRI as input. The output of the
ensemble is a 2-channel disease's coordinate map able to be transformed into a
3D grading map which is easy to interpret for clinicians. This 2-channel map is
coupled with a multi-layer perceptron classifier for different classification
tasks. Second, we propose to combine our deep learning framework with a
traditional machine learning strategy based on volume to improve the model
discriminative capacity and robustness. After both cross-validation and
external validation, our experiments based on 3319 MRI demonstrated competitive
results of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods for both disease

Such a measure of uncertainty is necessary when change point methods are

determining whether an organ is viable for transplant. The key of our proposal
is framing the problem as a product of multiple single changes in the scale
parameter. We fit the model through an iterative procedure similar to what is
done for additive models. The novelty is that each iteration returns a
probability distribution on time instances, which captures the uncertainty in
the change point location. Leveraging a recent result in the literature, we can
show that our proposal is a variational approximation of the exact model
posterior distribution. We study the algorithm's convergence and the change
point localization rate. Extensive experiments in simulation studies illustrate
the performance of our method and the possibility of generalizing it to more
complex data-generating mechanisms. We apply the new model to an experiment

steps: mapping reaction kinetics to low-dimensional manifolds and looking-up
this approximate manifold during CFD run-time to estimate the thermo-chemical
state variables. In our previous work, we showed that using a deep architecture
to learn the two steps jointly, instead of separately, is 73% more accurate at
estimating the source energy, a key state variable, compared to benchmarks and
can be integrated within a DNS turbulent combustion framework. In their natural
form, such deep architectures do not allow for uncertainty quantification of
the quantities of interest: the source energy and key species source terms. In
this paper, we expand on such architectures, specifically ChemTab, by
introducing deep ensembles to approximate the posterior distribution of the
quantities of interest. We investigate two strategies of creating these
ensemble models: one that keeps the flamelet origin information (Flamelets
strategy) and one that ignores the origin and considers all the data
independently (Points strategy). To train these models we used flamelet data
generated by the GRI--Mech 3.0 methane mechanism, which consists of 53 chemical
species and 325 reactions. Our results demonstrate that the Flamelets strategy
is superior in terms of the absolute prediction error for the quantities of
interest, but is reliant on the types of flamelets used to train the ensemble.
The Points strategy is best at capturing the variability of the quantities of
interest, independent of the flamelet types. We conclude that, overall, ChemTab
Deep Ensembles allows for a more accurate representation of the source energy
and key species source terms, compared to the model without these

approach for the within-season phenology estimation for cotton at the field
level. For this, we exploit a variety of Earth observation vegetation indices
(derived from Sentinel-2) and numerical simulations of atmospheric and soil
parameters. Our method is unsupervised to address the ever-present problem of
sparse and scarce ground truth data that makes most supervised alternatives
impractical in real-world scenarios. We applied fuzzy c-means clustering to
identify the principal phenological stages of cotton and then used the cluster
membership weights to further predict the transitional phases between adjacent
stages. In order to evaluate our models, we collected 1,285 crop growth ground
observations in Orchomenos, Greece. We introduced a new collection protocol,
assigning up to two phenology labels that represent the primary and secondary
growth stage in the field and thus indicate when stages are transitioning. Our
model was tested against a baseline model that allowed to isolate the random
agreement and evaluate its true competence. The results showed that our model
considerably outperforms the baseline one, which is promising considering the
unsupervised nature of the approach. The limitations and the relevant future

$\Omega_{QQQ'}$ ($Q,Q'=b,c$) in the framework of potential nonrelativistic

considered as ground chromo-Coulombic bound states. We find that the
chromopolarizability $\beta_\Omega$ of a fully heavy baryon $QQQ$ is 2.6 times
the chromopolarizability $\beta_\psi$ of the quarkonium $\bar{Q}Q$ with the
same heavy quark flavor $Q$. This result is accurate up to the correction of
the order 0.3 for $Q=b$ and provides an order-of-magnitude estimate for $Q=c$.
We discuss the dependence of the ratio $\beta_\Omega/\beta_\psi$ on the heavy
quark mass $m_Q$ and the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ as well as on the
ratio of the masses $m_{Q'}/m_Q$, in the case not all quarks in the baryon are
identical. Since the chromopolarizability of heavy hadrons defines the strength
of their interaction at low energies mediated by soft gluons, which at long
range hadronize into pairs of pions and kaons, our findings argue in favor of
the existence of near-threshold states composed of pairs of fully heavy

create Wigner negativity on Alice's side if and only if there is Gaussian
steering from Alice to Bob. In this work, we attempt to generalise these
findings to a much broader class of scenarios on which Alice and Bob share a
non-Gaussian state. We show that if Alice can initially steer Bob's system with
Wigner-positive measurements, Bob can remotely create Wigner negativity in

safe. This in turn involves an exhaustive search on the entire search space.
That approach can quickly become computationally expensive. We reformulate the

Such results can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following
diffusion process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D
consistency by modeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream

we study $\textbf{3D local editing}$ and propose a two-step solution that can
generate 360$^{\circ}$ manipulated results by editing an object from a single
view. Step 1, we propose to perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted
noises. Step 2, we conduct a noise-to-text inversion process that maps 2D
blended noises into the view-independent text embedding space. Once the
corresponding text embedding is obtained, 360$^{\circ}$ images can be
generated. Last but not least, we extend our model to perform \textbf{one-shot

of the conservation law for energy for each pipe segment to a semi-analytical
input-output relation between the pipe outlet temperature and the pipe inlet
and ground temperatures that can be identified from training data. The ROM
basically is valid for generic pipe configurations involving 3D unsteady heat
transfer and 3D steady flow as long as heat-transfer mechanisms are linearly
dependent on the temperature field. Moreover, the training data can be
generated by physics-based computational ""full-order"" models (FOMs) yet also by
(calibration) experiments or field measurements. Performance tests using
computational training data for a single 1D pipe configuration demonstrate that
the ROM (i) can be successfully identified and (ii) can accurately describe the
response of the outlet temperature to arbitrary input profiles for inlet and
ground temperatures. Application of the ROM to two case studies, i.e. fast
simulation of a small DH network and design of a controller for user-defined
temperature regulation of a DH system, demonstrate its predictive ability and
efficiency also for realistic systems. Dedicated cost analyses further reveal
that the ROM may significantly reduce the computational costs compared to FOMs
by (up to) orders of magnitude for higher-dimensional pipe configurations.
These findings advance the proposed ROM as a robust and efficient simulation
tool for practical DH systems with a far greater predictive ability than
existing compact models.

the currents, as well as density profile. We show that, for any finite system,
for $\alpha<1$, the density profile eventually becomes uniform while for
$\alpha >1$, an eventual non-trivial stationary profile is reached. We also
find that, in the limit of thermodynamic system size, at late times, the

current in the short-time regime using a trajectory-based perturbative
approach. Using numerical simulations, we show that in the long-time regime,
the diffusive current distribution follows a scaling form with an
$\alpha-$dependent scaling function. We also characterise the behaviour of the
total current using renewal approach. We find that the average total current
also grows algebraically $\sim t^{\phi}$ where $\phi = 1/2$ for $\alpha \le 1$,
$\phi=3/2-\alpha$ for $1 < \alpha \le 3/2$, while for $\alpha > 3/2$ the

variance of the total current also shows an algebraic growth with an exponent
$\Delta=1$ for $\alpha \le 1$, and $\Delta=2-\alpha$ for $1 < \alpha \le 2$,
whereas it approaches a constant value for $\alpha>2$. The total current

million people in North America. Currently, the reference standard for
assessing scoliosis is based on the manual assignment of Cobb angles at the
site of the curvature center. This manual process is time consuming and
unreliable as it is affected by inter- and intra-observer variance. To overcome
these inaccuracies, machine learning (ML) methods can be used to automate the
Cobb angle measurement process. This paper proposes to address the Cobb angle
measurement task using YOLACT, an instance segmentation model. The proposed
method first segments the vertebrae in an X-Ray image using YOLACT, then it
tracks the important landmarks using the minimum bounding box approach. Lastly,
the extracted landmarks are used to calculate the corresponding Cobb angles.
The model achieved a Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) score of
10.76%, demonstrating the reliability of this process in both vertebra

often inhibited by energy considerations for thermal electrons. The
transformations include excitation and ionization of atoms and molecules, which
affect the detectability of these gases and constrain the fraction of incident
stellar radiation that transforms into heat. To gain insight into these
important questions, we build a Monte Carlo model that solves the slowing down
of photoelectrons in a gas with arbitrary amounts of H and He atoms and thermal
electrons. Our novel multi-score scheme differs from similar tools in that it
efficiently handles rare collisional channels, as in the case of low-abundance
excited atoms that undergo superelastic and inelastic collisions. The model is
validated and its performance demonstrated. Further, we investigate whether
photoelectrons might affect the population of the excited hydrogen H(2)
detected at some exoplanet atmospheres by transmission spectroscopy in the
H-$\alpha$ line. For the ultra-hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b, we find that
photoelectron-driven excitation of H(2) is inefficient at the pressures probed
by the line core but becomes significant (yet sub-dominant) deeper in the
atmosphere where the line wings form. The contribution of photoelectrons to the
destruction of H(2) either by collisional deexcitation or ionization is
entirely negligible, a conclusion likely to hold for exoplanet atmospheres at
large. Importantly, photoelectrons dominate the gas ionization at the altitudes
probed by the H-$\alpha$ line, a fact that will likely affect, even if
indirectly, the population of H(2) and other tracers such as metastable helium.
Future modeling of these excited levels should incorporate photoelectron-driven

is currently an open question with relatively few and contradictory answers, as
well as important implications for our understanding of the nature of star
formation quenching processes at cosmic noon. Here we revisit far-infrared
(FIR) observations of the REQUIEM-ALMA sample of six z = 1.6 - 3.2 QGs strongly
lensed by intermediate-redshift galaxy clusters. We measured their continuum
emission using priors obtained from high resolution near-infrared (NIR)
imaging, as opposed to focusing on point-source extraction, converted it into
dust masses using a FIR dust emission model derived from statistical samples of
QGs, and compared the results to those of the reference work. We find that,
while at least the most massive sample galaxy is indeed dust-poor, the picture
is much more nuanced than previously reported. In particular, these more
conservative constraints remain consistent with high dust fractions in early
QGs. We find that these measurements are very sensitive to the adopted
extraction method and conversion factors: the use of an extended light model to
fit the FIR emission increases the flux of detections by up to 50% and the
upper limit by up to a factor 6. Adding the FIR-to-dust conversion, this
amounts to an order of magnitude difference in dust fraction, casting doubts on
the power of these data to discriminate between star formation quenching
scenarios. Unless these are identified by other means, mapping the dust and gas
in high-redshift QGs will continue to require somewhat costly observations.

from the 6th internal Data Release of the Gaia-ESO survey. In this sample, we
group stars by similarity in chemical abundances via hierarchical clustering.
Our analysis treats both measured Li abundances and upper limits. The Li
envelope of the previously identified radially migrated stars is well below the
benchmark meteoritic value (<3.26 dex); the star with the highest detected
abundance has A(Li) = 2.76 dex. This confirms the previous trends observed for
old dwarf stars (median ages $\sim$ 8 Gyr), where Li decreases for
[Fe/H]$\gtrsim$0. This result acts as supporting evidence that the abundance of
Li measured in the upper envelope of old dwarf stars should not be considered a
proxy for the interstellar medium Li. Our scenario also indicates that the
stellar yields for [M/H]>0 should not be decreased, as recently proposed in the
literature. Our study backs the recent studies that claimed that old dwarfs on
the hot side of the dip are efficient probes of the ISM abundance of Li,
provided atomic diffusion does not lower significantly the initial Li abundance
in the atmospheres of metal-rich objects.

and application of entanglement renormalization group (ERG) have been playing a
vital role in the study of novel quantum phases of matter, especially
long-range entangled (LRE) states in topologically ordered systems. For
instance, by recursively applying local unitaries as well as adding/removing
qubits that form product states, the 2D toric code ground states, i.e., fixed
point of Z_2 topological order, are efficiently coarse-grained with respect to
the system size. As a further improvement, the addition/removal of 2D toric
codes into/from the ground states of the 3D X-cube model, is shown to be
indispensable and remarkably leads to well-defined fixed points of a large
class of fracton orders that are non-liquid-like. Here, we present a
substantially unified ERG framework in which general degrees of freedom are
allowed to be recursively added/removed. Specifically, we establish an exotic
hierarchy of ERG and LRE states in Pauli stabilizer codes, where the 2D toric
code and 3D X-cube models are naturally included. In the hierarchy, LRE states
like 3D X-cube and 3D toric code ground states can be added/removed in ERG
processes of more complex LRE states. In this way, a large group of Pauli
stabilizer codes are categorized into a series of ``state towers''; with each
tower, in addition to local unitaries including CNOT gates, lower LRE states of
level-$n$ are added/removed in the level-$n$ ERG process of an upper LRE state
of level-$(n+1)$, connecting LRE states of different levels and unveiling
complex relations among LRE states. As future directions, we expect this
hierarchy can be applied to more general LRE states, leading to a unified ERG
scenario of LRE states and exact tensor-network representations in the form of
more generalized branching MERA.

in the electronic structure of Cr-doped VO2 films coherently grown on TiO2
(001) substrates. The electronic phase diagram of CrxV1-xO2 is drawn by a
combination of electric and spectroscopic measurements. The phase diagram is
similar to that of bulk CrxV1-xO2, while the temperature of metal-insulator
transition (TMIT) is significantly suppressed by the epitaxial strain effect.
In the range of x = 0-0.04, where TMIT remains unchanged as a function of x,
the PES spectra show dramatic change across TMIT, demonstrating the
characteristic spectral changes associated with the Peierls phenomenon. In
contrast, for x > 0.04, the TMIT linearly increases, and the metal-insulator
transition (MIT) may disappear at x = 0.08-0.12. The PES spectra at x = 0.08
exhibit pseudogap behavior near the Fermi level, whereas the characteristic
temperature-induced change remains almost intact, suggesting the existence of
local V-V dimerization. The suppression of V-V dimerization with increasing x
was confirmed by polarization-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy. These
spectroscopic investigations reveal that the energy gap and V 3d states are
essentially unchanged with 0 $\le$ x $\le$ 0.08 despite the suppression of V-V
dimerization. The invariance of the energy gap with respect to x suggests that
the MIT in CrxV1-xO2 arises primarily from the strong electron correlations,
namely the Peierls-assisted Mott transition. Meanwhile, the pseudogap at x =
0.08 eventually evolves to a full gap (Mott gap) at x = 0.12, which is
consistent with the disappearance of the temperature-dependent MIT in the
electronic phase diagram. These results demonstrate that a Mott insulating
phase without V-V dimerization is stabilized at x > 0.08 as a result of the
superiority of Mott instability over the Peierls one.

but mass-loss prescriptions fail to reflect this. Evolutionary models show that
the total amount of mass lost during this phase determines if these stars
evolve to warmer temperatures before undergoing core collapse. The current
Geneva evolutionary models mimic episodic mass loss by enhancing the quiescent
prescription rates whenever the star's outer layers exceed the Eddington
luminosity by a large factor. This results in a 20 solar-mass model undergoing
significantly more mass loss during the RSG phase than it would have otherwise,
but has little effect on models of lower masses. We can test the validity of
this approach observationally by measuring the proportion of high-luminosity
RSGs to that predicted by the models. To do this, we use our recent
luminosity-limited census of RSGs in M31 and M33, making modest improvements to
membership, and adopting extinctions based on the recent panchromatic M31 and
M33 Hubble surveys. We then compare the proportions of the highest luminosity
RSGs found to that predicted by published Geneva models, as well as to a
special set of models computed without the enhanced rates. We find good
agreement with the models which include the supra-Eddington enhanced mass loss.

of a pure state of a composite system-environment computational ""universe"" with
a simple system $\mathcal{S}$ coupled to a constant temperature bath
$\mathcal{E}$. The principal focus is ""excess entropy production"" in which the
quantum entropy change is greater than expected from the classical entropy-free
energy relationship. We analyze this in terms of quantum spreading of time
dependent states, and its interplay with the idea of a microcanonical shell.
The entropy takes a basis-dependent Shannon information definition. We argue
for the zero-order $\mathcal{SE}$ energy basis as the unique choice that gives
classical thermodynamic relations in the limit of weak coupling and high
density of states, including an exact division into system and environment
components. Entropy production takes place due to two kinds of processes. The
first is classical ""ergodization"" that fills the full density of states within
the microcanonical shell. The second is excess entropy production related to
quantum spreading or ""quantum ergodization"" of the wavepacket that effectively
increases the width of the energy shell. Lorentzian superpositions with finite
microcanonical shell width lead to classical results as the limiting case, with
no excess entropy. We then consider a single $\mathcal{SE}$ zero-order initial
state, as the examplar of extreme excess entropy production. Systematic formal
results are obtained for a unified treatment of excess entropy production for
time-dependent Lorentzian superpositions, and verified computationally. It is
speculated that the idea of free energy might be extended to a notion of
""available energy"" corresponding to the excess entropy production. A unified
perspective on quantum thermodynamic entropy is thereby attained from the
classical limit to extreme quantum conditions.

capacitor pads and junction wire of transmon qubit makes it possible to
engineer the surface dielectric loss. In this paper, we present the shape
optimization approach for reducing Surface dielectric loss in transmon qubit.
The capacitor pad and junction wire of the transmon qubit are shaped as spline
curves and optimized through the combination of the finite-element method and
global optimization algorithm. Then, we compared the surface participation
ratio, which represents the portion of electric energy stored in each
dielectric layer and proportional to two-level system (TLS) loss, of optimized

The result suggests that the participation ratio of capacitor pad, and junction
wire can be reduced by 16% and 26% compared to previous designs through shape
optimization, while overall footprint and anharmonicity maintain acceptable

constructicon, (ii) the convergence rate of grammars exposed to independent
registers, and (iii) the rate at which constructions are forgotten when they
have not been recently observed. These experiments show that the lexicon grows
more quickly than the grammar and that the growth rate of the grammar is not
dependent on the growth rate of the lexicon. At the same time,
register-specific grammars converge onto more similar constructions as the
amount of exposure increases. This means that the influence of specific
registers becomes less important as exposure increases. Finally, the rate at
which constructions are forgotten when they have not been recently observed
mirrors the growth rate of the constructicon. This paper thus presents a
computational model of usage-based grammar that includes both the emergence and

responsive colloids (RCs) which actively change their size and mutual
interactions. The colloidal size is explicitly resolved in our RC model as an
internal degree of freedom (DOF) in addition to the particle translation. A
Hertzian pair potential between the RCs leads to repulsion and shrinking of the
particles, resulting in an explicit responsiveness of the system to
self-crowding. To render the colloids active, their size is internally driven
by a dichotomous noise, randomly switching ('breathing') between growing and
shrinking states with a predefined rate, as motivated by recent experiments on
synthetic active colloids. The polydispersity of this dichotomous active
responsive colloid (D-ARC) model can be tuned by the parameters of the noise.
Utilizing stochastic computer simulations, we study crowding effects on the
spatial distributions, relaxation times, and self-diffusion of dense
suspensions of the D-ARCs. We find a substantial influence of the 'built-in'
intrinsic noise on the system's behavior, in particular, transitions from
unimodal to bimodal size distributions for an increasing colloid density as
well as intrinsic noise-modified diffusive translational dynamics. We conclude
that controlling the noise of internal DOFs of a macromolecule or cell is a
powerful tool for active colloidal materials to enable autonomous changes in
the system's collective structure and dynamics towards the adaption of
macroscopic properties to external perturbations.

which we refer to as $\Sigma(1400)$. With the idea of motivating experimental
investigations of $\Sigma(1400)$, we have studied its photoproduction process
and determined the respective cross sections and polarization observables. We
have studied also the coupling of $N^*(1895)$ to $K\Sigma(1400)$ and found that
it gives an important contribution to the cross sections near the threshold. In
the process, we have determined the branching ratios of the decay of
$N^*(1895)$, to the final states involving $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Sigma(1400)$,
to be in the range of 6-7 MeV. Our findings can motivate consideration of
alternative processes in partial wave analyses of experimental data, when
studying the properties of $N^*(1895)$.

state-of-the-art method cryoDRGN uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework
to learn a continuous distribution of protein structures from single particle
cryo-EM imaging data. While cryoDRGN can model complex structural motions, the
Gaussian prior distribution of the VAE fails to match the aggregate approximate
posterior, which prevents generative sampling of structures especially for
multi-modal distributions (e.g. compositional heterogeneity). Here, we train a
diffusion model as an expressive, learnable prior in the cryoDRGN framework.
Our approach learns a high-quality generative model over molecular
conformations directly from cryo-EM imaging data. We show the ability to sample
from the model on two synthetic and two real datasets, where samples accurately
follow the data distribution unlike samples from the VAE prior distribution. We
also demonstrate how the diffusion model prior can be leveraged for fast latent

of evidence have been provided by transmission electron microscopy and
atomistic computer simulations that different stable and metastable grain
boundary structures can occur. Meanwhile, theories to treat them
thermodynamically as grain boundary phases have been developed. Whereas atomic
structures were identified at particular grain boundaries for particular
materials, it remains an open question if these structures and their
thermodynamic excess properties are material specific or generalizable to,
e.g., all fcc metals. In order to elucidate that question, we use atomistic
simulations with classical interatomic potentials to investigate a range of
high-angle [111] symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Au, Al, and
Pb. We could indeed find two families of grain boundary phases in all of the
investigated grain boundaries, which cover most of the standard fcc materials.
Where possible, we compared the atomic structures to atomic-resolution electron
microscopy images and found that the structures match. This poses the question
if the grain boundary phases are simply the result of sphere-packing geometry
or if material-specific bonding physics play a role. We tested this using
simple model pair potentials and found that medium-ranged interactions are
required to reproduce the atomic structures, while the more realistic material
models mostly affect the grain boundary (free) energy. In addition to the
structural investigation, we also report the thermodynamic excess properties of
the grain boundaries, explore how they influence the thermodynamic stability of
the grain boundary phases, and detail the commonalities and differences between
the materials.

respect to the observer gives rise to spin-1 polarisation in the observer frame
even in the context of General Relativity. These are pure projection effects,
proportional to the plus and cross polarisations in the source frame, hence
they do not correspond to new degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the
spin-1 modes can always be rewritten as pure spin-2 modes coming from an
aberrated direction. Since gravitational waves are not isotropically emitted
around binary systems, this aberration modifies the apparent orientation of the
binary system with respect to the observer: the system appears slightly rotated
due to the source velocity. Fortunately, this bias does not propagate to other
parameters of the system (and therefore does not spoil tests of General
Relativity), since the impact of the velocity can be fully reabsorbed into new
orientation angles.

up to PeV in energy. The accelerated cosmic rays are expected to interact
hadronically with nearby ambient gas or the interstellar medium, resulting in
{\gamma}-rays and neutrinos. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower
Observatory (LHAASO) identified 12 {\gamma}-ray sources with emissions above
100 TeV, making them candidates for PeV cosmic-ray accelerators (PeVatrons).
While at these high energies the Klein-Nishina effect suppresses exponentially
leptonic emission from Galactic sources, evidence for neutrino emission would
unequivocally confirm hadronic acceleration. Here, we present the results of a
search for neutrinos from these {\gamma}-ray sources and stacking searches
testing for excess neutrino emission from all 12 sources as well as their
subcatalogs of supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae with 11 years of
track events from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. No significant emissions
were found. Based on the resulting limits, we place constraints on the fraction
of {\gamma}-ray flux originating from the hadronic processes in the Crab Nebula

time projection chamber, with an internal $^{37}$Ar source was performed. This
calibration source features a 35-day half-life and provides two mono-energetic
lines at 2.82 keV and 0.27 keV. The photon yield and electron yield at 2.82 keV
are measured to be (32.3$\pm$0.3) photons/keV and (40.6$\pm$0.5) electrons/keV,
respectively, in agreement with other measurements and with NEST predictions.
The electron yield at 0.27 keV is also measured and it is
(68.0$^{+6.3}_{-3.7}$) electrons/keV. The $^{37}$Ar calibration confirms that
the detector is well-understood in the energy region close to the detection
threshold, with the 2.82 keV line reconstructed at (2.83$\pm$0.02) keV, which
further validates the model used to interpret the low-energy electronic recoil
excess previously reported by XENON1T. The ability to efficiently remove argon
with cryogenic distillation after the calibration proves that $^{37}$Ar can be
considered as a regular calibration source for multi-tonne xenon detectors.

DNS responses using digital signatures. DNS operates primarily over UDP, which
leads to several constraints: notably, packets should be at most 1232 bytes
long to avoid problems during transmission. Larger DNS responses either need to
be fragmented into several UDP responses or the request would need to be
repeated over TCP, neither of which is sufficiently reliable in today's DNS
ecosystem. While RSA or elliptic curve digital signatures are sufficiently
small to avoid this problem, even for DNSSEC packets containing both a public
key and a signature, this problem is unavoidable when considering the larger
sizes of post-quantum schemes.
  We propose ARRF, a method of fragmenting DNS resource records at the
application layer (rather than the transport layer) that is request-based,
meaning the initial response contains a truncated fragment and then the
requester sends follow-up requests for the remaining fragments. Using
request-based fragmentation avoids problems identified for several previously
proposed (and rejected) application-level DNS fragmentation techniques. We
implement our approach and evaluate its performance in a simulated network when
used for the three post-quantum digital signature schemes selected by NIST for
standardization (Falcon, Dilithium, and SPHINCS+) at the 128-bit security
level. Our experiments show that our request-based fragmentation approach
provides substantially lower resolution times compared to standard DNS over UDP
with TCP fallback, for all the tested post-quantum algorithms, and with less
data transmitted in the case of both Falcon and Dilithium. Furthermore, our

of an automatic speech recognition interface and a natural language

be used for downstream tasks such as intent prediction. The approach uses a
masked language modelling objective to learn the representations, and thus
benefits from both the left and right contexts. We show that the performance of
the resulting encodings before fine-tuning is better than comparable models on
multiple datasets, and that fine-tuning the top layers of the representation
model improves the current state of the art on the Fluent Speech Command
dataset, also in a low-data regime, when a limited amount of labelled data is
used for training. Furthermore, we propose class attention as a spoken language

Several international agendas for accomplishing common global goals emphasize
the need for active youth participation and engagement for sustainable
development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes the need
for youth engagement and the inclusion of youth perspectives as an important
step toward addressing each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of
this study is to analyze youth perspectives, values, and sentiments towards
issues addressed by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals through social network
analysis using machine learning. Social network data collected during 7 major
sustainability conferences aimed at engaging children and youth is analyzed
using natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis. This data
categorized using a natural language processing text classifier trained on a
sample dataset of social network data during the 7 youth sustainability
conferences for deeper understanding of youth perspectives in relation to the
SDGs. Machine learning identified demographic and location attributes and
features are utilized in order to identify bias and demographic differences
between ages, gender, and race among youth. Using natural language processing,
the qualitative data collected from over 7 different countries in 3 languages
are systematically translated, categorized, and analyzed, revealing key trends
and focus areas for sustainable youth development policies. The obtained
results reveal the general youth's depth of knowledge on sustainable
development and their attitudes towards each of the 17 SDGs. The findings of
this study serve as a guide toward better understanding the interests, roles,
and perspectives of children and youth in achieving the goals of Agenda 2030.

due to its importance. To improve the airspace operation, new technologies are
under development, such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In fact, in the
past few years, there has been a growth in UAS numbers in segregated airspace.
However, there is an interest in integrating these aircraft into the National
Airspace System (NAS). The UAS is vital to different industries due to its
advantages brought to the airspace (e.g., efficiency). Conversely, the
relationship between UAS and Air Traffic Control (ATC) needs to be well-defined
due to the impacts on ATC capacity these aircraft may present. Throughout the
years, this impact may be lower than it is nowadays because the current lack of
familiarity in this relationship contributes to higher workload levels.
Thereupon, the primary goal of this research is to present a comprehensive
review of the advancements in the integration of UAS in the National Airspace
System (NAS) from different perspectives. We consider the challenges regarding
simulation, final approach, and optimization of problems related to the
interoperability of such systems in the airspace. Finally, we identify several

one-period memory, this article demonstrates that the potential function of the
stochastic replicator dynamics (Foster and Young, 1990) allows it to predict
the emergence of error-proof cooperative strategies from the underlying
parameters of the repeated prisoner's dilemma. The observed cooperation rates
between q-learners are related to the ratio between the kinetic energy exerted
by the polar attractors of the replicator dynamics under the grim trigger
strategy. The frontier separating the parameter space conducive to cooperation
from the parameter space dominated by defection can be found by setting the
kinetic energy ratio equal to a critical value, which is a function of the
discount factor, $f(\delta) = \delta/(1-\delta)$, multiplied by a correction
term to account for the effect of the algorithms' exploration probability. The
gradient at the frontier increases with the distance between the game
parameters and the hyperplane that characterizes the incentive compatibility
constraint for cooperation under grim trigger.
  Building on literature from the neurosciences, which suggests that
reinforcement learning is useful to understanding human behavior in risky
environments, the article further explores the extent to which the frontier
derived for q-learners also explains the emergence of cooperation between
humans. Using metadata from laboratory experiments that analyze human choices
in the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma, the cooperation rates between
humans are compared to those observed between q-learners under similar
conditions. The correlation coefficients between the cooperation rates observed
for humans and those observed for q-learners are consistently above $0.8$. The
frontier derived from the simulations between q-learners is also found to
predict the emergence of cooperation between humans.

that fit the given demonstration. To address this, we propose a reward learning
approach, Graph-based Equivalence Mappings (GEM), that can discover spatial
goal representations that are aligned with the intended goal specification,
enabling successful generalization in unseen environments. Specifically, GEM
represents a spatial goal specification by a reward function conditioned on i)
a graph indicating important spatial relationships between objects and ii)
state equivalence mappings for each edge in the graph indicating invariant
properties of the corresponding relationship. GEM combines inverse
reinforcement learning and active reward learning to efficiently improve the

segmented the acute infarct on each scan. The neuroradiologists were divided
into training experts (A) and test experts (B and C). The dataset was randomly

reconstructing the metric tensor. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how
diffeomorphisms behave in this formalism, firstly by considering a specific
class of diffeomorphisms of the circle, namely the ellipses, and subsequently
by performing an explicit diffeomorphism to ``smoothen'' sets of points
generated by the tensor rank decomposition.

manipulation method that interactively edits an image using complex text
instructions. It allows users to not only improve the accuracy of image
manipulation but also achieve complex tasks such as enlarging, dwindling, or
removing objects and replacing the background with the input image. To make
these tasks possible, we apply three strategies. First, the given image is
divided into text-relevant content and text-irrelevant content. Only the
text-relevant content is manipulated and the text-irrelevant content can be
maintained. Second, a super-resolution method is used to enlarge the
manipulation region to further improve the operability and to help manipulate
the object itself. Third, a user interface is introduced for editing the
segmentation map interactively to re-modify the generated image according to
the user's desires. Extensive experiments on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011

learning a transition model from partially observed raw image traces. More
specifically, by considering the preceding and subsequent images in a trace, we
learn the latent state representations of raw observations and then build a
transition model based on such representations. Additionally, we propose a
neural-network-based approach to learn a heuristic model that estimates the

  Sensors on Nano-UAVs","DATE 2023",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nano-size unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) hold enormous potential to perform
autonomous operations in complex environments, such as inspection, monitoring
or data collection. Moreover, their small size allows safe operation close to
humans and agile flight. An important part of autonomous flight is
localization, which is a computationally intensive task especially on a
nano-UAV that usually has strong constraints in sensing, processing and memory.
This work presents a real-time localization approach with low element-count
multizone range sensors for resource-constrained nano-UAVs. The proposed
approach is based on a novel miniature 64-zone time-of-flight sensor from ST
Microelectronics and a RISC-V-based parallel ultra low-power processor, to
enable accurate and low latency Monte Carlo Localization on-board. Experimental
evaluation using a nano-UAV open platform demonstrated that the proposed
solution is capable of localizing on a 31.2m$\boldsymbol{^2}$ map with 0.15m
accuracy and an above 95% success rate. The achieved accuracy is sufficient for
localization in common indoor environments. We analyze tradeoffs in using full
and half-precision floating point numbers as well as a quantized map and
evaluate the accuracy and memory footprint across the design space.
Experimental evaluation shows that parallelizing the execution for 8 RISC-V
cores brings a 7x speedup and allows us to execute the algorithm on-board in
real-time with a latency of 0.2-30ms (depending on the number of particles),
while only increasing the overall drone power consumption by 3-7%. Finally, we
provide an open-source implementation of our approach.

according to the classification loss and domain discrimination loss of each

update rule to learn this network end-to-end, which is guided by
meta-classification loss on the selected pseudo-labeled target samples.
Therefore, this network can fit a weighting function according to the
cross-user WHAR task at hand, which is superior to existing sample
differentiation rules fixed for special scenarios. Extensive experiments on
three public WHAR datasets demonstrate that SWL-Adapt achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the cross-user WHAR task, outperforming the

identification based on the source code is a well studied field, the
identification of vulnerabilities on basis of a binary executable without the
corresponding source code is more challenging. Recent research [1] has shown,
how such detection can be achieved by deep learning methods. However, that
particular approach is limited to the identification of only 4 types of
vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we analyze to what extent we could cover the
identification of a larger variety of vulnerabilities. Therefore, a supervised
deep learning approach using recurrent neural networks for the application of
vulnerability detection based on binary executables is used. The underlying
basis is a dataset with 50,651 samples of vulnerable code in the form of a
standardized LLVM Intermediate Representation. The vectorised features of a
Word2Vec model are used to train different variations of three basic
architectures of recurrent neural networks (GRU, LSTM, SRNN). A binary
classification was established for detecting the presence of an arbitrary
vulnerability, and a multi-class model was trained for the identification of
the exact vulnerability, which achieved an out-of-sample accuracy of 88% and
77%, respectively. Differences in the detection of different vulnerabilities
were also observed, with non-vulnerable samples being detected with a

controlled by the cosmological constant and dominated by the associated vacuum
energy. The universe starts as a classical de Sitter space with an infinite
effective vacuum energy density, which decreases subsequently like 1/t^3. The
corresponding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor also decreases over
time, showing that the common assumption that it describes the expansion of the
universe is incorrect and should be abandoned. Instead, the (cubic) expansion
of the universe is needed to satisfy energy conservation. Once the vacuum
energy density has decreased to the Planck level the first elementary particles
can be created through a direct conversion of vacuum energy. After this epoch,
the enormous kinetic energy enables a quick magnification of the number of
particles through ordinary production processes in tandem with the expansion of
space.
  The dominance of vacuum (dark) energy is supposed to persist into later
epochs, which enables a perturbative treatment of matter and radiation leading
to linear equations, which replace the usual FRW equations. The presence of
matter changes the vacuum metric, inducing a secondary matter term which might
explain the phenomenon of dark matter. Together with a similar induced
radiation term, it provides a possible explanation for the recent acceleration
of the expansion of the universe. The theory unifies particle physics and
cosmology by expressing particle physics units in terms of the gravitational
and cosmological constant. This relationship also explains a number of
numerical coincidences which have long puzzled physicists.
