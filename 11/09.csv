  Online Learned Nonlinear Transform Source-Channel Coding","Accepted by IEEE JSAC",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emerging field semantic communication is driving the research of
end-to-end data transmission. By utilizing the powerful representation ability
of deep learning models, learned data transmission schemes have exhibited
superior performance than the established source and channel coding methods.
While, so far, research efforts mainly concentrated on architecture and model
improvements toward a static target domain. Despite their successes, such
learned models are still suboptimal due to the limitations in model capacity
and imperfect optimization and generalization, particularly when the testing
data distribution or channel response is different from that adopted for model
training, as is likely to be the case in real-world. To tackle this, we propose
a novel online learned joint source and channel coding approach that leverages
the deep learning model's overfitting property. Specifically, we update the
off-the-shelf pre-trained models after deployment in a lightweight online
fashion to adapt to the distribution shifts in source data and environment
domain. We take the overfitting concept to the extreme, proposing a series of
implementation-friendly methods to adapt the codec model or representations to
an individual data or channel state instance, which can further lead to
substantial gains in terms of the bandwidth ratio-distortion performance. The
proposed methods enable the communication-efficient adaptation for all
parameters in the network without sacrificing decoding speed. Our experiments,
including user study, on continually changing target source data and wireless
channel environments, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
approach, on which we outperform existing state-of-the-art engineered
transmission scheme (VVC combined with 5G LDPC coded transmission).

common distance and in quantifiable environments. All are observed through the
Milky Way foreground, with varying degrees of contamination that depend on
observed Galactic latitude and the distance and size of the target galaxy. This
work uses Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) to identify foreground sources via
astrometric measurements and thus quantify foreground contamination for a large
sample of nearby galaxies. There are approximately half a million Gaia sources
in the directions of 1401 galaxies listed in the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue
(D<11 Mpc), excluding the largest Local Group galaxies. About two thirds of the
Gaia sources have astrometric properties consistent with foreground sources;
these sources are brighter, redder, and less centrally-concentrated than
non-foreground sources. Averaged over galaxies, foreground sources make up 50
per cent of Gaia sources at projected radius r50=1.06*a26, where a26 is the
angular diameter at the B=26.5 isophote. Foreground sources make up 50 per cent
of Gaia sources at apparent magnitude m(G,50)=20.50. This limit corresponds to
the tip of the red giant branch absolute magnitude at D = 450 kpc, and to the
globular cluster luminosity function peak absolute magnitude at 5 Mpc. Gaia

through 17 hours on source integration time, reaching a noise level of $\sim
0.2$ mK (T$^{*}_{A}$) with a corresponding extended source CO limit (3$\sigma$)
of 0.09 K km s$^{-1}$, 19 times more sensitive than previous works, we do not
detect the $^{12}$CO(1-0) emission line. However, the observations allow us to
estimate an upper limit (3$\sigma$) for the CO mass of about $7.4 \times 10^9$
M$_\odot$ for the extended emission, and $1.4 \times 10^8$ M$_\odot$ for the

corresponding molecular to atomic gas mass ratio is lower than 0.13. The
evidence suggests a quite different physical conditions for the interstellar

This, in one way to another, keeps an usual molecular gas tracer as CO hidden

particularly NaCl. However, an atomistic scale understanding of the process
remains elusive. Simulations lend themselves conveniently to studying
dissolution since they provide the spatio-temporal resolution that can be
difficult to obtain experimentally. Nevertheless, the complexity of various
inter- and intra-molecular interactions require careful treatment and long time
scale simulations, both of which are typically hindered by computational
expense. Here, we use advances in machine learning potential methodology to
resolve for the first time at an ab initio level of theory the dissolution
mechanism of NaCl in water. The picture that emerges is that of a steady
ion-wise unwrapping of the crystal preceding its rapid disintegration,
reminiscent of crumbling. The onset of crumbling can be explained by a strong
increase in the ratio of the surface to volume of the crystal. Overall,
dissolution is comprised of a series of highly dynamical microscopic
sub-processes, resulting in an inherently stochastic mechanism. These atomistic
level insights now pave the way for a general understanding of dissolution
mechanisms in other crystals, and the methodology is primed for more complex
systems of recent interest such as water/salt interfaces under flow and salt
crystals under confinement.

potentially improve users' experiences of audio AI modules deployed in the

ASR and audio-call enhancement, a PSE solution should operate in a streaming
mode, i.e., input audio cleaning should happen in real-time with a small

extracting a target speaker's voice profile from an enrolment audio, in the

while coercing it towards a prescribed project. We find that three distinct
strategies emerge as potential solutions as a function of just two parameters:
the ratio of herd size to shepherd repulsion length and the ratio of herd speed
to shepherd speed. We term these as: (i) mustering, in which the shepherd
circles the herd to ensure compactness, (ii) droving, in which the shepherd
chases the herd in a desired direction, and (iii) driving, a hitherto
unreported strategy where the flock surrounds a shepherd that drives it from
within. A minimal dynamical model for the size, shape and position of the herd
captures the effective behavior of the ABM, and further allows us to
characterize the different herding strategies in terms of the behavior of the
shepherd that librates (mustering), oscillates (droving) or moves steadily
(driving). All together, our study yields a simple and intuitive classification
of herding strategies that ought to be of general interest in the context of
controlling the collective behavior of active matter.

major common envelope evolution (CEE) phases. After the white dwarf (WD)
companion removes the hydrogen-rich envelope of the asymptotic giant branch
star its spiralling-in halts at few solar radii from the core, rather than
continuing to the carbon-oxygen (CO) core as in the hydrogen-rich SNe Ia-CSM CD
scenario. Only hundreds to tens of thousands of years later, after the
helium-rich core expands, does the WD enters a CEE with the helium-rich layer.
By that time the hydrogen-rich envelope is at a large distance from the center.
The WD merges with the CO core during the second CEE phase, and only after a
merger to explosion delay (MED) time of weeks to tens of years the merger
remnant explodes. The SN Ia ejecta collides with a helium-rich CSM at tens to
hundreds of AU. We follow the evolution of two stellar models with initial
masses of 5Mo and 7Mo to their asymptotic giant branch phase when they are
supposed to engulf the WD companion. We find that there is a sufficiently
massive CO core to merge with the WD in the frame of the CD scenario as well as
a massive helium-rich layer, ~0.3-1Mo, to account for the helium-rich CSM of SN

natural science applications, many aspects of the underlying physics are still
unclear. In particular, at high Re close to many real-life scenarios, the true
nature of the flow is partially masked by the inability of numerical
simulations to resolve all turbulent scales adequately. To overcome this issue,
we aim to numerically investigate fully-developed turbulent pipe flows at
moderate-to-high Re ($361 \leq Re_\tau \leq 6,000$), employing LES. A grid
convergence study, using the WALE subgrid stress model, is presented for
$Re_\tau=361$. Additionally, the prediction accuracy of distinct subgrid-scale
stress models, such as WALE, SMG, OEEVM, LDKM, and DSEM, is examined using a
range of statistical measures. The results infer, as expected, that SMG and
OEEVM are too dissipative, whereas WALE, LDKM, and, more surprisingly, DSEM
perform rather well compared to experiments and results from DNS. Moreover, LES
utilizing WALE are performed and investigated in detail for six different
Reynolds numbers in the interval from $Re_\tau = 361$ to $6,000$ with gradually
refined grids. These computations allow an insight into what turbulence
information is retained when LES with a wall model is applied to such high
Reynolds numbers in the limit of a relatively coarse grid. Second-order
statistics for all values of $Re_\tau$ exhibited excellent agreement with the
DNS data in the outer region. Surprisingly, results also revealed a dramatic
deviation from the DNS data in the sub-viscous layer region irrespective of the
$Re_\tau$, attributed to the considered scaling for mesh refinement. Overall,
the WALE model enabled accurate numerical simulations of high-Reynolds-number
wall-bounded flows at a fraction of the cost incurred if the inner layer was

approach in the style of David Lewis. This account entails reduction of the
upper entities to the bottom ones, when the latter behave appropriately. As
applied to WFR, it shows how the wavefunction can turn out to be identical to
three-dimensional objects, provided certain conditions. The first major goal of
the paper is thus to put forward an improved and more rigorous version of WFR,
which dissolves several extant issues about the theory, and can serve as a
starting point for the future literature about the topic. Moreover, the second
major goal of the article is to take WFR as a case study to demonstrate the
pros of functional reductionism, especially in the form defended here, thereby
helping to bring this view back in the philosophy of science debate. The
positive upshots of this paper suggest a possible application of functional
reductionism also to other contexts.

  Utilization","Accepted for presentation at ASPDAC'23",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimizing data movements is becoming one of the biggest challenges in
heterogeneous computing to cope with data deluge and, consequently, big data
applications. When creating specialized accelerators, modern high-level
synthesis (HLS) tools are increasingly efficient in optimizing the
computational aspects, but data transfers have not been adequately improved. To
combat this, novel architectures such as High-Bandwidth Memory with wider data
busses have been developed so that more data can be transferred in parallel.
Designers must tailor their hardware/software interfaces to fully exploit the
available bandwidth. HLS tools can automate this process, but the designer must
follow strict coding-style rules. If the bus width is not evenly divisible by
the data width (e.g., when using custom-precision data types) or if the arrays
are not power-of-two length, the HLS-generated accelerator will likely not
fully utilize the available bandwidth, demanding even more manual effort from
the designer. We propose a methodology to automatically find and implement a
data layout that, when streamed between memory and an accelerator, uses a
higher percentage of the available bandwidth than a naive or HLS-optimized
design. We borrow concepts from multiprocessor scheduling to achieve such high
efficiency.

neural networks function. Researchers have approached the problem of
determining unit importance in neural networks by probing their learned,
internal representations. Linear classifier probes identify highly selective
units as the most important for network function. Whether or not a network
actually relies on high selectivity units can be tested by removing them from
the network using ablation. Surprisingly, when highly selective units are
ablated they only produce small performance deficits, and even then only in
some cases. In spite of the absence of ablation effects for selective neurons,
linear decoding methods can be effectively used to interpret network function,
leaving their effectiveness a mystery. To falsify the exclusive role of
selectivity in network function and resolve this contradiction, we
systematically ablate groups of units in subregions of activation space. Here,
we find a weak relationship between neurons identified by probes and those
identified by ablation. More specifically, we find that an interaction between
selectivity and the average activity of the unit better predicts ablation
performance deficits for groups of units in AlexNet, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and
ResNet101. Linear decoders are likely somewhat effective because they overlap
with those units that are causally important for network function.
Interpretability methods could be improved by focusing on causally important

Nowadays, researchers have moved their interest towards AD detection from

existing state-of-the-art works proposing multimodal approaches do not take
into consideration the inter- and intra-modal interactions and propose early
and late fusion approaches. To tackle these limitations, we propose deep neural
networks, which can be trained in an end-to-end trainable way and capture the
inter- and intra-modal interactions. Firstly, each audio file is converted to
an image consisting of three channels, i.e., log-Mel spectrogram, delta, and
delta-delta. Next, each transcript is passed through a BERT model followed by a
gated self-attention layer. Similarly, each image is passed through a Swin
Transformer followed by an independent gated self-attention layer. Acoustic
features are extracted also from each audio file. Finally, the representation
vectors from the different modalities are fed to a tensor fusion layer for
capturing the inter-modal interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on the
ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced approaches obtain
valuable advantages over existing research initiatives reaching Accuracy and
F1-score up to 86.25% and 85.48% respectively.

quadratically with the time series' length, resulting in two performance
implications. First, the amount of data parallelism available is significantly
higher than the small number of processing units enabled by commodity systems
(e.g., CPUs). Second, sDTW is bottlenecked by memory because it 1) has low
arithmetic intensity and 2) incurs a large memory footprint. To tackle these
two challenges, we leverage Processing-using-Memory (PuM) by performing in-situ
computation where data resides, using the memory cells. PuM provides a
promising solution to alleviate data movement bottlenecks and exposes immense
parallelism.
  In this work, we present MATSA, the first MRAM-based Accelerator for Time

to enable energy-efficient and fast time series computation in memory. MATSA
provides the following key benefits: 1) it leverages high levels of parallelism
in the memory substrate by exploiting column-wise arithmetic operations, and 2)
it significantly reduces the data movement costs performing computation using
the memory cells. We evaluate three versions of MATSA to match the requirements
of different environments (e.g., embedded, desktop, or HPC computing) based on
MRAM technology trends. We perform a design space exploration and demonstrate

periodically variable and in February 2020 reached a historical minimum, the
Great Dimming. The aims of this study are to characterize Betelgeuse's
variability based on available archival data and to study possible causes of
light variability. Many spectra, from ultraviolet and optical regions, were
evaluated for spectral analysis. The spectra were used primarily to determine
radial velocities from different layers of atmosphere and their long{-}term
evolution. Additionally, photometric data were analyzed in different filters as
well, to construct light curves and to determine periods of the variability.
Spectroscopic and photometric variability are compared to each other and given
into a context with the Great Dimming.
  The two most dominant photometric periods are $ P_{1} = 2190 \pm 270 \: \rm d
$ and $ P_{2} = 417 \pm 17 \: \rm d $, while the dominant optical radial
velocity periods are $ P_{1, v_{\rm r}} = 2510 \pm 440 \: \rm d $ and $ P_{2,
v_{\rm r}} = 415 \pm 11 \: \rm d $. In the same time, the radial velocity
determined from ultraviolet spectra also shows variability and is distinctively
different from the variability of photospheric velocity, undergoing longer
periods of variability. We attribute these velocities to the velocities at the
base of outflowing wind. We also report a maximum of stellar wind velocity
during the Great Dimming, accompanied by the previously reported minimum of
brightness and the maximum of photospheric radial velocity. After the Dimming,
Betelgeuse mode of variability has fundamentally changed and is now instead
following a shorter period of $ \sim 200 \: \rm d $.

state of quarks and gluons and was extended along the years, covering a diverse
ensemble of observables related to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of
strong interactions. The experiment has studied Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, p-Pb and pp
collisions in the multi-TeV energy range, during the Run 1 and Run 2 data
taking periods at the LHC (2009-2018). The aim of this review article is to

properties of strongly interacting matter at the highest temperature reached in
the laboratory. It will be shown that it is possible to have a quantitative

show that various features, commonly ascribed to QGP formation, are detected
for a wide range of interacting system sizes. Precision measurements of

approximate CVP in the $\ell_p$ norm for any $p$ that is not an even integer.
This result was shown by giving a Karp reduction from $k$-SAT on $n$ variables
to approximate CVP on a lattice of rank $n$. In this work, we show a barrier
towards proving a similar result for CVP in the $\ell_p$ norm where $p$ is an
even integer. We show that for any $c, c'>0$, if for every $k > 0$, there
exists an efficient reduction that maps a $k$-SAT instance on $n$ variables to
a $(1+exp(-n^c)))$-CVP instance for a lattice of rank at most $n^{c'}$ in the
Euclidean norm, then $\mathsf{coNP} \subset \mathsf{NP/Poly}$. We prove a
similar result for $(1+exp(-n^c)))$-CVP for all even norms under a mild
additional promise that the ratio of the distance of the target from the
lattice and the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice is bounded by
$exp(n^{O(1)})$.
  Furthermore, we show that for any $c,c' > 0$, and any even integer $p$, if
for every $k > 0$, there exists an efficient reduction that maps a $k$-SAT
instance on $n$ variables to a $(1+exp(-n^c)))$-$SVP_p$ instance for a lattice
of rank at most $n^{c'}$, then $\mathsf{coNP} \subset \mathsf{NP/Poly}$. The
result for SVP does not require any additional promise.
  While prior results have indicated that lattice problems in the $\ell_2$ norm
(Euclidean norm) are easier than lattice problems in other norms, this is the
first result that shows a separation between these problems.
  We achieve this by using a result by Dell and van Melkebeek [JACM, 2014] on
the impossibility of the existence of a reduction that compresses an arbitrary
$k$-SAT instance into a string of length $\mathcal{O}(n^{k-\epsilon})$ for any
$\epsilon>0$. In addition to CVP, we also show that the same result holds for
the Subset-Sum problem using similar techniques.

Texas's electric grid, ERCOT, has been seeing increases in power demand due to
a growing population, increased air conditioning use, and pushes for
electrification across other industries. The electrification of vehicles will
only add to this demand increase. This paper focuses on evaluating different EV

strong increase in the peak demand can lead to challenges to keep the

these models are typically computationally expensive or inaccurate for certain
space weather conditions. In response, this work aims to employ a probabilistic
machine learning (ML) method to create an efficient surrogate for the
Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM), a
physics-based thermosphere model. Our method leverages principal component
analysis to reduce the dimensionality of TIE-GCM and recurrent neural networks
to model the dynamic behavior of the thermosphere much quicker than the

(ROPE) uses Long-Short Term Memory neural networks to perform time-series
forecasting in the reduced state and provide distributions for future density.
We show that across the available data, TIE-GCM ROPE has similar error to
previous linear approaches while improving storm-time modeling. We also conduct
a satellite propagation study for the significant November 2003 storm which

Real-world domain styles can vary substantially due to environment changes and

style gap impedes model generalization on diverse real-world domains. Our
proposed Normalization Perturbation (NP) can effectively overcome this domain
style overfitting problem. We observe that this problem is mainly caused by the
biased distribution of low-level features learned in shallow CNN layers. Thus,
we propose to perturb the channel statistics of source domain features to
synthesize various latent styles, so that the trained deep model can perceive
diverse potential domains and generalizes well even without observations of
target domain data in training. We further explore the style-sensitive channels
for effective style synthesis. Normalization Perturbation only relies on a
single source domain and is surprisingly effective and extremely easy to
implement. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method for

tropospheric temperature field and its variability. Previous studies of Jupiter
hinted at periodic behavior that was non-seasonal, as well as dynamical
relationships between tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures. However,
these observations were made over time frames shorter than Jupiter's orbit or
they used sparse sampling. We derived upper-tropospheric (300-mbar)
temperatures over 40 years, extending those studies to cover several orbits of
Jupiter, revealing unexpected results. Periodicities of 4, 7 8-9 and 10-14
years were discovered that involved different latitude bands and seem
disconnected from seasonal changes in solar heating. Anti-correlations of
variability in opposite hemispheres were particularly striking at 16, 22 and 30
degrees from the equator. Equatorial temperature variations are also
anticorrelated with those 60-70 km above. Such behavior suggests a top-down
control of equatorial tropospheric temperatures from stratospheric dynamics.
Realistic future global climate models must address the origins of these
variations in preparation for their extension to a wider array of gas-giant

and recover the dynamic head as static pressure. Automated computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) shape optimization of the stator blades was performed to
maximize pressure recovery at the operating point of 1.5 LPM and 16,000 RPM.
Additionally, the effect on hemolysis and thrombogenicity was assessed using
numerical modeling. The optimization algorithm favored fewer blades of greater
length over a larger number of short blades. The ratio of wrap angle to axial
length emerged as a key constraint to ensure the viability of a design. The
best design had 2 blades and generated 73 mmHg of pressure recovery in an
isolated stage. When re-introduced to the CFD simulation of the complete flow
path, the added stator stage increased the pump head by 46% and improved the
pump efficiency from 21.9% to 25.7% at the selected operating point. Automated
CFD shape optimization combined with in silico evaluation of hemocompatibility
can be an effective tool for exploring design choices and informing early
development process.

is constructed by using energy distribution arguments. The new energy-based ROM
lengthscale is fundamentally different from the current ROM lengthscales, which
are built by using dimensional arguments. To assess the novel, energy-based ROM
lengthscale, we compare it with a standard, dimensionality-based ROM
lengthscale in two fundamentally different types of models: (i) the
mixing-length ROM (ML-ROM), which is a ROM closure model; and (ii) the
evolve-filter-relax ROM (EFR-ROM), which is a regularized ROM. We test the four
combinations (i.e., ML-ROM and EFR-ROM equipped with the energy-based and
dimensionality-based lengthscales) in the numerical simulation of the turbulent
channel flow at $Re_{\tau} = 395$. The numerical investigation yields the
following conclusions: (i) The new energy-based ROM lengthscale is
significantly (almost two orders of magnitude) larger than the standard
dimensionality-based ROM lengthscale. As a result, the energy-based lengthscale
yields more stable ML-ROMs and EFR-ROMs than the dimensionality-based
lengthscale. (ii) The energy-based lengthscale displays the correct asymptotic
behavior with respect to the ROM dimension, whereas the dimensionality-based
lengthscale does not. (iii) The energy-based lengthscale yields ML-ROMs and
(when significant filtering is effected) EFR-ROMs whose parameters are less
sensitive (i.e., more robust) than the parameters of the ML-ROMs and EFR-ROMs
based on the dimensionality-based lengthscale. The novel energy-based
lengthscale could enable the development of better scale-aware ROM strategies
for flow-specific applications and is expected to have long term applications
in nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics.

H$_{2}$ and super-molecules, such as H$_{2}$ or H$_{2}$, at sufficiently high
densities. When the latter form at $n_{\rm H}$ $\geq$ $10^{14}$~cm$^{-3}$,
collision-induced emission (CIE) provides efficient gas cooling. We investigate
how CIE cooling affects the formation of metal-free binaries comparing
simulations with and without this process. Irrespective of the cooling
mechanism, we find a typical protostellar mass range between 0.01 to 100
M$_{\odot}$. However, models with only H$_{2}$ line cooling produce a greater
number of low-mass protostars which exhibit stronger variations in their radial
velocities than the high-mass protostars. Similarly, in models with both
H$_{2}$ cooling and CIE cooling, significant variations in the radial
velocities are found for protostars in the intermediate mass range. The initial
number of fragments $N_{\rm max}$ decreases with increasing strength of
turbulence. Cooling via super-molecules lets the most massive protobinaries
(MMPBs) efficiently accrete mass. The maximum mass accretion rate $\dot M_{\rm
max}$ for the MMPBs is more than an order of magnitude higher in the presence
of CIE cooling than for pure H$_{2}$ line cooling. As a result, compact
binaries with a semi-major axis as small as 3.57 au may form through the
H$_{2}$ $-$ H$_{2}$ cooling channel. Our results indicate that in addition to
the MMPBs most population III (Pop. III) binaries should be in eccentric i.e.
non-circular orbits. This provides an important connection to the eccentric
binaries reported in previous studies, which were found to exhibit rich
temporal accretion signals during their evolution.

between the ejecta and several solar masses of circumstellar matter (CSM) as
evidenced by strong Balmer-line emission. Within the first few weeks after the
explosion, they may display spectral features similar to overluminous Type Ia
SNe, while at later phase their observation properties exhibit remarkable
similarities with some extreme case of Type IIn SNe that show strong Balmer
lines years after the explosion. We present polarimetric observations of
SN2018evt obtained by the ESO Very Large Telescope from 172 to 219 days after
the estimated time of peak luminosity to study the geometry of the CSM. The
nonzero continuum polarization decreases over time, suggesting that the mass
loss of the progenitor star is aspherical. The prominent H$\alpha$ emission can
be decomposed into a broad, time-evolving component and an intermediate-width,
static component. The former shows polarized signals, and it is likely to arise
from a cold dense shell (CDS) within the region between the forward and reverse
shocks. The latter is significantly unpolarized, and it is likely to arise from
shocked, fragmented gas clouds in the H-rich CSM. We infer that SN2018evt
exploded inside a massive and aspherical circumstellar cloud. The symmetry axes
of the CSM and the SN appear to be similar. SN\,2018evt shows observational
properties common to events that display strong interaction between the ejecta
and CSM, implying that they share similar circumstellar configurations. Our
preliminary estimate also suggests that the circumstellar environment of
SN2018evt has been significantly enriched at a rate of $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ over a period of $>100$ yr.

occupation numbers that refer to a basis of eigenstates of the non-interacting

appropriate characteristic of such states, which can be applied to oscillators
of any dimensionality. For a one-dimensional oscillator, the state purity is
directly related to a thermal occupation number defined with respect to the
number state basis in which the oscillator's quantum state is thermal. Thus, it
naturally introduces a more versatile definition of an average occupation
number. We study optomechanical sideband cooling of one- and two-dimensional
mechanical oscillators in particular, and derive exact analytical expressions
for the maximal mechanical state purity achievable in the quantum backaction
limit. In the case of a one-dimensional oscillator, we show that the thermal
occupation number related to purity can be well approximated by the average
phonon number in the weak-coupling regime, but that the two differ in the
regime of ultrastrong optomechanical coupling or in cases where the
oscillator's resonance frequency is strongly renormalized.

enabling full brain quantitative T1, T2 and proton density (PD) maps at 1.15

embedded in the standard 3D-QALAS encoding scheme, enabling full brain
quantitative parameter maps (T1, T2, and PD) at acceleration factors of R=3x2
with minimum SNR loss due to g-factor penalties. The quantitative parameter

  Maximum Likelihood","13 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partitioning algorithms play a key role in many scientific and engineering
disciplines. A partitioning algorithm divides a set into a number of disjoint
subsets or partitions. Often, the quality of the resulted partitions is
measured by the amount of impurity in each partition, the smaller impurity the
higher quality of the partitions. In general, for a given impurity measure
specified by a function of the partitions, finding the minimum impurity
partitions is an NP-hard problem. Let $M$ be the number of $N$-dimensional
elements in a set and $K$ be the number of desired partitions, then an
exhaustive search over all the possible partitions to find a minimum partition
has the complexity of $O(K^M)$ which quickly becomes impractical for many
applications with modest values of $K$ and $M$. Thus, many approximate
algorithms with polynomial time complexity have been proposed, but few provide
bounded guarantee. In this paper, an upper bound and a lower bound for a class
of impurity functions are constructed. Based on these bounds, we propose a
low-complexity partitioning algorithm with bounded guarantee based on the
maximum likelihood principle. The theoretical analyses on the bounded guarantee
of the algorithms are given for two well-known impurity functions Gini index
and entropy. When $K \geq N$, the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
results in terms of lowest approximations and polynomial time complexity
$O(NM)$. In addition, a heuristic greedy-merge algorithm having the time
complexity of $O((N-K)N^2+NM)$ is proposed for $K<N$. Although the greedy-merge
algorithm does not provide a bounded guarantee, its performance is comparable
to that of the state-of-the-art methods. Our results also generalize some
well-known information-theoretic bounds such as Fano's inequality and
Boyd-Chiang's bound.

significant development in autonomous multiagent and robotic systems research

since there is no generic framework to transfer skills between agents other
than a query-response-based approach. Moreover, natural living systems have a
""forgetfulness"" property for everything they learn. Analyzing such ephemeral
nature (temporal memory properties of new knowledge gained) in artificial
systems has never been studied in the literature. We propose a behavior
tree-based framework to realize a query-response mechanism for transferring
skills encoded as the condition-action control sub-flow of that portion of the
knowledge between agents to fill this gap. We simulate a multiagent group with
different initial knowledge on a foraging mission. While performing basic
operations, each robot queries other robots to respond to an unknown condition.
The responding robot shares the control actions by sharing a portion of the
behavior tree that addresses the queries. Specifically, we investigate the
ephemeral nature of the new knowledge gained through such a framework, where
the knowledge gained by the agent is either limited due to memory or is
forgotten over time. Our investigations show that knowledge grows
proportionally with the duration of remembrance, which is trivial. However, we
found minimal impact on knowledge growth due to memory. We compare these cases
against a baseline that involved full knowledge pre-coded on all agents. We
found that knowledge-sharing strived to match the baseline condition by sharing

contamination of the leading-twist signal. An analysis of the short-distance
behavior of the space-like matrix elements using matching coefficients computed
to next-to-leading order (NLO) exposes the desired PDF up to this additional

to isolate the helicity PDFs normalized by the nucleon axial charge at the same

approach to sample approximately uniformly from the body. The requirement is
that from a suitable initial distribution, the distribution of the walk comes
close to the uniform distribution $\pi_K$ on $K$ after a number of steps
polynomial in $n$ and the aspect ratio $R/r$ (i.e., when $rB_2 \subseteq K
\subseteq RB_{2}$).
  Proofs of rapid mixing of such walks often require the probability density
$\eta_0$ of the initial distribution with respect to $\pi_K$ to be at most
$\mathrm{poly}(n)$: this is called a ""warm start"". Achieving a warm start often
requires non-trivial pre-processing before starting the random walk. This
motivates proving rapid mixing from a ""cold start"", wherein $\eta_0$ can be as
high as $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. Unlike warm starts, a cold start is usually
trivial to achieve. However, a random walk need not mix rapidly from a cold
start: an example being the well-known ""ball walk"". On the other hand, Lov\'asz
and Vempala proved that the ""hit-and-run"" random walk mixes rapidly from a cold
start. For the related coordinate hit-and-run (CHR) walk, which has been found
to be promising in computational experiments, rapid mixing from a warm start
was proved only recently but the question of rapid mixing from a cold start
remained open.
  We construct a family of random walks inspired by classical decompositions of
subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into countably many axis-aligned dyadic cubes. We
show that even with a cold start, the mixing times of these walks are bounded
by a polynomial in $n$ and the aspect ratio. Our main technical ingredient is
an isoperimetric inequality for $K$ for a metric that magnifies distances
between points close to the boundary of $K$. As a corollary, we show that the
CHR walk also mixes rapidly both from a cold start and from a point not too
close to the boundary of $K$.

relation between Loop Quantum Gravity and Loop Quantum Cosmology. According to
our model the evolution of the Universe is periodic. The quantum gravity
effects resolve the Big Bang singularity leading to a Big Bounce and cause the

bootstrap admits scattering amplitudes involving pions and vectors through
five-point tree-level order by order in mass-dimension, but requires the
introduction of a tr(F^3) operator. Gauge theories with this operator were
recently found to require a tower of higher-derivative operators to be

double-copy construction at its most conservative seems to require the UV
completion of DBVIA + pure Poincare supergravity scattering amplitudes to a

supergravity. We also point out an alternative solution to color-dual gauged
pions that allows adjoint double-copy without a tower of higher derivative

radar will track space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) up to 1000 km and at the

intends to discuss possible ways to take advantage of having these two sensors
at the same location. Using both types of sensors takes advantage of the radar
measurements which give precise radial velocity and distance to the objects,
while the telescope gives better sky coordinates measurements. With the
installation of radar and optical sensors, PASO can extend observation time of
space debris and correlate information from optical and radar provenances in
real time. During twilight periods both sensors can be used simultaneously to
rapidly compute new TLEs for LEO objects, eliminating the time delays involved
in data exchange between sites in a large SST network. This concept will not
replace the need for a SST network with sensors in multiple locations around
the globe, but will provide a more complete set of measurements from a given
object passage, and therefore increase the added value for initial orbit
determination, or monitoring of reentry campaigns of a given location. PASO
will contribute to the development of new solutions to better characterize the

Tailoring spectral electromagnetic response underpins important applications
ranging from sensing to energy conversion, and is flourishing with new ideas
from non-Hermitian physics. There exist excellent theoretical tools for
modeling such responses, particularly coupled-mode theories and
quasinormal-mode expansions. Yet these approaches offer little insight into the
outer limits of what is possible when broadband light interacts with any
designable nanophotonic pattern. We show that a special scattering matrix, the
""$\mathbb{T}$"" matrix, can always be decomposed into a set of fictitious
Drude--Lorentz oscillators with matrix-valued (spatially nonlocal)
coefficients. For any application and any scatterer, the only designable
degrees of freedom are these matrix coefficients, implying strong constraints
on lineshapes and response functions that had previously been ""hidden."" To
demonstrate the power of this approach, we apply it to near-field radiative
heat transfer, where there has been a long-standing gap between the best known
designs and theoretical limits to maximum energy exchange. Our new framework
identifies upper bounds that come quite close to the current state-of-the-art,
and explains why unconventional plasmonic materials should be superior to
conventional plasmonic materials. More generally, this approach can be
seamlessly applied to high-interest applications across nanophotonics --
including for metasurfaces, imaging, and photovoltaics -- and may be
generalizable to unique challenges that arise in acoustic and/or quantum

at distance at most $2$ in $G$ receive different colors. We investigate the
complexity of finding a square coloring with a given number of $q$ colors. We
show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable on graphs of bounded
treewidth by presenting an algorithm with running time $n^{2^{\operatorname{tw}
+ 4}+O(1)}$ for graphs of treewidth at most $\operatorname{tw}$. The somewhat
unusual exponent $2^{\operatorname{tw}}$ in the running time is essentially
optimal: we show that for any $\epsilon>0$, there is no algorithm with running
time $f(\operatorname{tw})n^{(2-\epsilon)^{\operatorname{tw}}}$ unless the
Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.
  We also show that the square coloring problem is NP-hard on planar graphs for
any fixed number $q \ge 4$ of colors. Our main algorithmic result is showing
that the problem (when the number of colors $q$ is part of the input) can be
solved in subexponential time $2^{O(n^{2/3}\log n)}$ on planar graphs. The
result follows from the combination of two algorithms. If the number $q$ of
colors is small ($\le n^{1/3}$), then we can exploit a treewidth bound on the
square of the graph to solve the problem in time $2^{O(\sqrt{qn}\log n)}$. If
the number of colors is large ($\ge n^{1/3}$), then an algorithm based on
protrusion decompositions and building on our result for the bounded-treewidth

Unfortunately, the vast majority of partitions of the levels cannot be built

regression tree and a new decision rule prior that can assign multiple levels
to both the left and right child of a decision node. Motivated by spatial
applications with areal data, we introduce a further decision rule prior that
partitions the areas into spatially contiguous regions by deleting edges from
random spanning trees of a suitably defined network. We implemented our new

the predicted SNe Ia rates from WD in binaries are thought to be insufficient
to explain the observed SNe Ia rate, it is important to study similar
interactions in higher-order multiple star systems such as triple systems. We
use the evolutionary population synthesis code Multiple Stellar Evolution (MSE)
to study stellar evolution, binary interactions and gravitational dynamics of
the triple-star systems. Also, unlike previous studies, prescriptions are
included to simultaneously take into account the single and double degenerate
channels, and we consider triples across the entire parameter space (including
those with tight inner binaries). We explore the impact of typically ignored or
uncertain physics such as fly-bys and CE prescription parameters on our

time-integrated SNe Ia rate from the triple channel is found to be $(3.60 \pm

similar to that of the isolated binary channel where the SNe Ia rate is $(3.2

significantly to the binding energy, and therefore is an essential component of
the conjecture. In AdS$_5$, we give analytic expressions for the self-binding

the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound, and in AdS$_4$ when it is massless. We
show that the massless case reproduces the flat-space expressions in the large

present the results of a search for CL behaviour in 412 Swift-BAT detected AGN
with multiple epochs of optical spectroscopy from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic
Survey (BASS). 125 of these AGN also have 14-195 keV ultra-hard X-ray
light-curves from Swift-BAT which are contemporaneous with the epochs of
optical spectroscopy. Eight CL events are presented for the first time, where
the appearance or disappearance of broad Balmer line emission leads to a change
in the observed Seyfert type classification. Combining with known events from
the literature, 21 AGN from BASS are now known to display CL behaviour. Nine CL
events have 14-195 keV data available, and five of these CL events can be
associated with significant changes in their 14-195 keV flux from BAT. The
ultra-hard X-ray flux is less affected by obscuration and so these changes in
the 14-195 keV band suggest that the majority of our CL events are not due to
changes in line-of-sight obscuration. We derive a CL rate of 0.7-6.2 per cent
on 10-25 year time-scales, and show that many transitions happen within at most
a few years. Our results motivate further multi-wavelength observations with
higher cadence to better understand the variability physics of accretion onto
SMBHs.

relativistic integrable string theories, since they allow to derive the

non-relativistic strings in AdS$_5\times S^5$. First we show that for string
solutions whose Lax connection is independent of $\sigma$, the eigenvalues of
the monodromy matrix do not have any spectral parameter dependence. We remark
that this particular behaviour also appears for relativistic strings in flat
space. Second, for some simple non-relativistic string solutions where the path
ordered exponential of the Lax connection can be computed, we show that the
monodromy matrix is either diagonalisable with quasi-momenta independent of the
spectral parameter, or non-diagonalisable. For the latter case, we propose a
notion of generalised quasi-momenta, based on maximal abelian subalgebras,
which retain a dependence on the spectral parameter.

discoveries of ionized gas surrounding X-ray cavities in other radio galaxies

bar evolution in spinning dark matter (DM) halos. Previous works have shown
that the halo spin has a substantial effect on the bar evolution and can lead
to bar dissolution following the vertical buckling instability. Here, we invoke
the DM spin sequence, $\lambda=0-0.09$, and study the effect of DM density
along this $\lambda$-sequence by varying the compactness of DM halo. We find
that (1) varying the DM density has a profound effect on the stellar bar
evolution along the $\lambda$-sequence, namely, on its amplitude, pattern
speed, buckling time, etc.; (2) For $\lambda\gtrsim 0.04$, the buckling
instability has been delayed progressively, and does not occur when the bar has
reached its maximal strength; (3) Instead, stellar bars remain near maximal
strength, and their amplitude plateau stage extends over $\sim 1-7$ Gyr,
terminating with the buckling instability; (4) Although stellar bars remain
strong during the plateau, their pattern speed stays nearly constant. The
reason for this unusual behavior of stellar bars follows from the highly
reduced gravitational torques which they experience due to the DM bar being
aligned with the stellar bar. The performed orbital analysis shows that the
delayed buckling results from a slow evolution of stellar oscillations along
the bar major and vertical axes -- thus postponing the action of the vertical
2:1 resonance which pumps the rotational energy into vertical motions; (5)
Peanut/boxy shaped bulges form at the beginning of the plateau and grow with
time; (6) Strong stellar bars in spinning halos can avoid fast braking,
resolving the long standing discrepancy between observations and $N$-body
simulations. This behavior of stellar bars along the $\lambda$- and DM
density-sequences, reveals a wealth of stellar bar properties which require
additional study.

populations based on their orbital history: recent and ancient infallers, and
backsplash and neighbouring galaxies. We find that $\sim 85$ per cent of the
current population of quenched galaxies located inside the clusters are ancient
infallers with low or null content of hot and cold gas. The fraction of
quenched ancient infallers increases strongly between the first and second
pericentric passage, due to the removal of hot gas by the action of
ram-pressure stripping (RPS). The majority of them quenches after the first
pericentric passage, but a non-negligible fraction needs a second passage,
specially galaxies with $M_\star \leq 10^{10.5} \, {\rm M_\odot}$. Recent
infallers represent $\sim 15$ per cent of the quenched galaxies located inside
the cluster and, on average, they contain a high proportion of hot and cold
gas; moreover, pre-processing effects are the responsible for quenching the
recent infallers prior to infall onto the main cluster progenitor. The $\sim
65$ per cent of quenched galaxies located around clusters are backsplash
galaxies, for which the combination of RPS acting during a pre-processing stage
and inside the cluster is necessary for the suppression of SF in this

to quantify resonant stability, strength and variation instigated by stellar
evolution for a single-planet system containing asteroids on both crossing and

with only main-sequence values by computing a maximum libration width as a
function of asteroid longitude of pericentre. We also quantify the relative
efficiency of mean motion resonances of different orders to stabilize versus
destabilize asteroid orbits during both the giant branch and white dwarf

represent $\sim25-40\%$ of the total number of satellites in the system, and
are roughly perpendicular to their corresponding central disk galaxies during
certain periods, consistently with Milky Way $z=0$ data. KPP satellite members
are statistically distinguishable from satellites outside KPPs: they show
higher specific orbital angular momenta, orbit more perpendicularly to the
central disk galaxy, and have larger pericentric distances, than the latter. We
numerically prove, for the first time, that KPPs and the best-quality

from Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$) and {\it Gaia}. We
reconstruct the proper motion, radial velocity, distance, on-sky track and
stellar density along the stream with spline models. The stream has a total
luminosity of $M_V=-8.2$ and metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1.9$, similar to
classical Milky Way (MW) satellites like Draco. The stream shows drastic
changes in its physical width varying from 200 pc to 1 kpc, but a constant line
of sight velocity dispersion of 5 km/ss. Despite the large apparent variation
in the stellar number density along the stream, the flow rate of stars along
the stream is remarkably constant. We model the 6-D stream track by a
Lagrange-point stripping method with a flexible MW potential in the presence of
a moving extended Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This allows us to constrain the
mass profile of the MW within the distance range 15.6 < r < 55.5 kpc, with the
best measured enclosed mass of $(2.85\pm 0.1)\times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ within
32.4 kpc. Our stream measurements are highly sensitive to the LMC mass profile
with the most precise measurement of its enclosed mass made at 32.8 kpc,
$(7.02\pm 0.9)\times10^{10}\, {\rm M}_\odot$. We also detect that the LMC dark
matter halo extends to at least 53 kpc. The fitting of the OC stream allows us
to constrain the past LMC trajectory and the degree of dynamical friction it
experienced. We demonstrate that the stars in the OC stream show large energy
and angular momentum spreads caused by LMC perturbation.

locally injected in the regime where ions are decoupled from neutrals for its

the formation and growth of planetary cores in a pressure bump, motivated by
the annular structures observed in protoplanetary disks, starting with
sub-micron-sized dust grains. We connect the models of dust coagulation and
drift, planetesimal formation in the streaming instability, gravitational
interactions between planetesimals, pebble accretion, and planet migration,
into one uniform framework. We find that planetesimals forming early at the
massive end of the size distribution grow quickly dominantly by pebble
accretion. These few massive bodies grow on the timescales of ~100 000 years
and stir the planetesimals formed later preventing the emergence of further
planetary cores. Additionally, a migration trap occurs allowing for retention
of the growing cores. Pressure bumps are favourable locations for the emergence
and rapid growth of planetary cores by pebble accretion as the dust density and
grain size are increased and the pebble accretion onset mass is reduced
compared to a smooth-disk model.

This method enables the exploration of the phase-space of binary asteroids,
which is difficult to explore using common detection techniques. We describe a
forward model that projects the center-of-light position with respect to the
center-of-mass, as it is seen by the observer. We study the performance of this
method using simulated Gaia-like data. We apply the astrometric method to a
subset of the Gaia DR2 Solar System catalog and find no significant evidence of
binary asteroids. This is likely because the Gaia DR2 removed astrometric
outliers, which in our case may be due to astrophysical signals. Applying this
method to binary asteroid (4337) Arecibo, for which Gaia DR3 reported a
possible astrometric signal with a period of P = 32.85+/-0.38 hr, reveals a
possible 2.2-sigma solution with a period of 16.26 hr (about half the reported

in the known binary asteroid population from Pravec et al. relative to the
entire asteroid population in the Gaia DR2 Solar System catalog. We also
discuss some caveats like precession and asteroid rotation.

consider two variables commonly used to characterise scalar perturbations: the
curvature perturbation on uniform-density hypersurfaces $\zeta$ and the
comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. For standard cosmological models
in general relativity as well as in loop quantum cosmology, these quantities
are conserved and equal on super-horizon scales for adiabatic perturbations.
Here we show that while these statements can be extended to a more general form
of modified Friedmann equations similar to that of loop quantum cosmology, in
other cases, such as the simplest group field theory bounce scenario, $\zeta$
is conserved across the bounce whereas $\mathcal{R}$ is not. We relate our
results to approaches based on a second order equation for a single

rotational-energy of a highly-magnetized, rapidly-rotating neutron star. The
emission from the associated luminous pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can photoionize
the SN ejecta, leading to a nebular spectrum of the ejecta with signatures
possibly revealing the PWN. SN 2012au is hypothesized to be one such SN. We
investigate the impact of different ejecta and PWN parameters on the SN nebular
spectrum, and test if any photoionization models are consistent with SN 2012au.
We study how constraints from the nebular phase can be linked into modelling of
the diffusion phase and the radio emission of the magnetar. We present a suite
of late-time (1-6y) spectral simulations of SN ejecta powered by an inner PWN.
Over a large grid of 1-zone models, we study the behaviour of the SN physical
state and line emission as PWN luminosity ($L_{\rm PWN}$), injection SED
temperature ($T_{\rm PWN}$), ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$), and composition (pure
O or realistic) vary. We discuss the resulting emission in the context of the
observed behaviour of SN 2012au, a strong candidate for a PWN-powered SN. The
SN nebular spectrum varies as $T_{\rm PWN}$ varies, as the ejecta become less
ionized as $T_{\rm PWN}$ increases. Low ejecta mass models at high PWN power
obtain runaway ionization for O I and, in extreme cases, also O II, causing a
sharp decrease in their ion fraction over a small change in the parameter
space. Certain models can reproduce the oxygen lines luminosities of SN 2012au
reasonably well at individual epochs, but we find no model that fits over the
whole time evolution; this is likely due to the simple model setup. Using our
derived constraints from the nebular phase, we predict that the magnetar
powering SN 2012au had an initial rotation period $\sim$ 15 ms, and should be a
strong radio source (F > 100 $\mu$Jy) for decades.

support exceeds a certain threshold. The non-thermal pressures considered in
the Parker instability are cosmic ray pressure and magnetic pressure. This
instability takes a long time to saturate $(>500 \, \mathrm{Myr})$ and assumes
a background with fixed cosmic ray pressure to gas pressure ratio. In reality,
galactic cosmic rays are injected into localized regions $(< 100
\,\mathrm{pc})$ by events like supernovae, increasing the cosmic ray pressure
to gas pressure ratio. In this work, we examine the effect of such cosmic ray
injection on large scales $ (\sim 1\,\mathrm{kpc})$ in cosmic ray
magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the \texttt{Athena++} code. We vary the
background properties, dominant cosmic ray transport mechanism, and injection
characteristics between our simulation runs. We find the injection will disrupt
the interstellar medium on shorter timescales than the Parker instability. If
cosmic ray transport by advection is dominant, cosmic ray injection disrupts
the disk on short time scales $(<100\,\mathrm{Myr})$. If cosmic ray transport
by the streaming instability is dominant, the injection creates a buoyant flux
tube long after the initial injection $(>150\,\mathrm{Myr})$. Finally, when
cosmic ray transport by diffusion dominates, the injected cosmic rays make an
entire flux tube over pressured in a short time $(\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Myr})$.
This over pressure pushes gas off the tube and drives buoyant rise on time
scales similar to the advection dominated case.

probe this hypothesis. We use full density-matrix simulations to rank the noise
resilience of leading gate-based VQE algorithms in ground-state computations on
a range of molecules. We find that, in the presence of noise: (i) ADAPT-VQEs
that construct ansatz circuits iteratively outperform VQEs that use ""fixed""
ansatz circuits; and (ii) ADAPT-VQEs perform better when circuits are
constructed from gate-efficient elements rather than physically-motivated ones.
Our results show that, for a wide range of molecules, even the best-performing
VQE algorithms require gate-error probabilities on the order of $10^{-6}$ to
$10^{-4}$ to reach chemical accuracy. This is significantly below the
fault-tolerance thresholds of most error-correction protocols. Further, we
estimate that the maximum allowed gate-error probability scales inversely with
the number of noisy (two-qubit) gates. Our results indicate that useful

undirected graph in the value oracle model examined by [RSW18]. This model
arises as a natural special case of submodular function maximization: on query
$S \subseteq V$, the oracle returns the total weight of the cut between $S$ and
$V \backslash S$.
  For most constants $c \in (0,1]$, we nail down the query complexity of
achieving a $c$-approximation, for both deterministic and randomized algorithms
(up to logarithmic factors). Analogously to general submodular function
maximization in the same model, we observe a phase transition at $c = 1/2$: we
design a deterministic algorithm for global $c$-approximate max-cut in $O(\log
n)$ queries for any $c < 1/2$, and show that any randomized algorithm requires
$\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ queries to find a $c$-approximate max-cut for any $c >
1/2$. Additionally, we show that any deterministic algorithm requires
$\Omega(n^2)$ queries to find an exact max-cut (enough to learn the entire
graph), and develop a $\tilde{O}(n)$-query randomized $c$-approximation for any
$c < 1$.
  Our approach provides two technical contributions that may be of independent
interest. One is a query-efficient sparsifier for undirected weighted graphs
(prior work of [RSW18] holds only for unweighted graphs). Another is an
extension of the cut dimension to rule out approximation (prior work of
[GPRW20] introducing the cut dimension only rules out exact solutions).

TempPNet differs from existing prototype learning models in its capability of

using real-world motion sensor data show that TempPNet outperforms
state-of-the-art benchmarks in depression prediction. Moreover, TempPNet
interprets its predictions by visualizing the temporal progression of
depression and its corresponding symptoms detected from sensor data. We further
conduct a user study to demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in
interpretability. This study offers an algorithmic solution for impactful

approximately 1 in 4000 people, RP is caused by a series of genetic mutations;
each specific mutation presents a specific pathological pattern in the patient,
with the same mutation even presenting in different phenotypes in different
patients (14). RP generally starts with peripheral vision loss, attacking the
rods first, causing nyctalopia or night blindness (22). In later stages of the
disease, the cones start to atrophy, further narrowing the field of vision and
obscuring central vision (22). Luckily, with recent advances in medical imaging
techniques and novel therapeutic treatments, both early detection and the
overall prognosis of RP in patients have improved dramatically in the past few
decades. This review will trace RP's physiological causes, how it affects
retinal and ocular physiology, the techniques through which we can diagnose and
image it, and the various treatments developed to try to combat it. The medical
imaging techniques to be discussed include but are not limited to adaptive
optics (AO), OCT including SD-OCT and OCTA, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and
its associated fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy (FLIO), colour
Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), microperimetry, and MRI. The treatments to be
discussed include stem cell therapy, gene therapy, cell transplantation,
pharmacological therapy, and artificial retinal implants. Throughout this
review, it will be made evident of not just the severity and diversity through
which RP can present, but also the advanced made in medical imaging and
innovative treatments designed to combat this pathology.

pipeline performance. We address this issue with QuantPipe, a
communication-efficient distributed edge system that introduces post-training
quantization (PTQ) to compress the communicated tensors. QuantPipe uses
adaptive PTQ to change bitwidths in response to bandwidth dynamics, maintaining
transformer pipeline performance while incurring limited inference accuracy
loss. We further improve the accuracy with a directed-search analytical
clipping for integer quantization method (DS-ACIQ), which bridges the gap
between estimated and real data distributions. Experimental results show that
QuantPipe adapts to dynamic bandwidth to maintain pipeline performance while
achieving a practical model accuracy using a wide range of quantization
bitwidths, e.g., improving accuracy under 2-bit quantization by 15.85\% on
ImageNet compared to naive quantization.

of the turbulence integral length scale ($D/l >0.1$) tend to increase the
turbulent kinetic energy of the carrier fluid above the single-phase value, and
smaller particles tend to suppress it. A revised phenomenological model of the
$k-\epsilon$ type was developed to reproduce these effects with the correct
asymptotic limit of no turbulence modulation for small particles, and
augmentation for larger diameter solids. Particle-kinetic theory was used to
derive the work exchanged between the particles and the fluid due to both drag
and added mass forces to accommodate any particle/fluid density ratios
including bubbles, droplets and heavy solids. For the larger particles, we
devised a new model for vortex shedding induced by the slip between the
particles and the turbulent flow, due to particle inertia. Simple approximate
formulae for the turbulence modulation were obtained through asymptotic
analysis.
  The overall effect for solid particles is that augmentation for large
diameter solids is due to vortex shedding, and turbulence suppression for small
diameters is due to mainly to turbulent drag forces and extra fluid
dissipation. The transition from suppression to augmentation around $D/l = 0.1$
is a robust feature for a wide range of particle Reynolds and Stokes numbers,
but we could not prove this to be a general relation on a theoretical basis.
Indeed, bubbles and droplets may not display turbulence augmentation at all for
the larger diameters due to moderate turbulence levels needed to prevent
breakup, and the velocity difference between particles and fluid may therefore
be too low for vortex shedding to occur. On the basis of the model we find that
some data for solids in vertical gas flow show very large turbulence
augmentation that can only be due to gravitational settling.

estimation methods for mobile platforms. However, when visual tracking fails,
VIO algorithms quickly diverge due to rapid error accumulation during inertial

Gaussian noise and a slowly changing bias which evolves as a random walk. In
this work, we propose to train a neural network to learn the true bias
evolution. We implement and compare two common sequential deep learning
architectures: LSTMs and Transformers. Our approach follows from recent
learning-based inertial estimators, but, instead of learning a motion model, we
target IMU bias explicitly, which allows us to generalize to locomotion
patterns unseen in training. We show that our proposed method improves state
estimation in visually challenging situations across a wide range of motions by
quadrupedal robots, walking humans, and drones. Our experiments show an average
15% reduction in drift rate, with much larger reductions when there is total
vision failure. Importantly, we also demonstrate that models trained with one

trotting) without retraining.

implemented by imposing constraints on the system to make sure that reference

application of their properties to examples of recent interest in quantum

spectrum model that is capable of joining continuum and line emissions that
assume the same prior SFR model. We subsequently analyze the effectiveness of
the joint model in the context of the EXperiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture
Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM), which utilizes the [CII] molecular line to study
the SFR. We numerically compute the theoretical power spectra according to our
model and the EXCLAIM survey specifics, and perform Fisher analysis to obtain
SFR parameter constraints. We find that although the joint model has no
considerable advantage over LIM alone assuming the current survey level of
EXCLAIM, its effects become significant when we consider more optimistic values
of survey resolution and angular span that are expected of future LIM
experiments. By manipulating the Fisher formalism, we show that the CIB is not
only an additional SFR sensitive signal, but also serves to break the SFR
parameter degeneracy that naturally emerges from the [CII] Fisher matrix. For
this reason, addition of the CIB will allow improvements in the survey

sources using string matching techniques is proposed in this paper. Earlier
work has shown that the rate-distortion bound can be asymptotically achieved by
a 'natural type selection' (NTS) mechanism which iteratively encodes
asymptotically long source strings (from an unknown source distribution P) and
regenerates the codebook according to a maximum likelihood distribution
framework, after observing a set of K codewords to 'd-match' (i.e., satisfy the
distortion constraint for) a respective set of K source words. This result was
later generalized for sources with memory under the assumption that the source
words must contain a sequence of asymptotic-length vectors (or super-symbols)
over the source super-alphabet, i.e., the source is considered a vector source.
However, the earlier result suffers from a significant practical flaw, more
specifically, it requires expanding the super-symbols (and correspondingly the
super-alphabet) lengths to infinity in order to achieve the rate-distortion
bound, even for finite memory sources, e.g., Markov sources. This implies that
the complexity of the NTS iteration will explode beyond any practical
capabilities, thus compromising the promise of the NTS algorithm in practical
scenarios for sources with memory. This work describes a considerably more
efficient and tractable mechanism to achieve asymptotically optimal performance

many animals: flow information helps them localize food, mates, and prey and to
escape predators. Across species, many flow sensors take the form of long,
flexible cantilevers. These cantilevers are known to exhibit sustained
oscillations when interacting with fluid flow. In the presence of vortex
shedding, the oscillations occur through mechanisms such as wake- or
vortex-induced vibrations. There is, however, no clear explanation for the
mechanisms governing the sustained oscillation of flexible cantilevers without
vortex shedding. In recent work, we showed that a flexible cylindrical
cantilever could experience sustained oscillations in its first natural
vibration mode in water at Reynolds numbers below the critical Reynolds number
of vortex shedding. The oscillations were shown to be driven by a frequency
match (synchronization) between the flow frequency and the cantilever's
first-mode natural frequency. Here, we use a body-fitted fluid-structure solver
based on the Navier-Stokes and nonlinear structural equations to simulate the
dynamics of a cantilevered whisker in the air at a subcritical value of
Reynolds number. Results show that second-mode synchronization governs the
whisker's sustained oscillation. Wavy patterns in the shear layer dominate the
whisker's wake during the vibrations, indicating that parallel shear layers
synchronize with the whisker's motion. As a result of this synchronization,
oval-shaped motion trajectories, with matching streamwise and cross-flow
vibration frequencies, are observed along the whisker. The outcomes of this
study suggest possible directions for designing artificial bio-inspired flow
sensors.

a mapping from high-dimensional radar measurements to low-dimensional latent

table, perhaps for a game of chance or for dinner. Given a set of agents such
as $\{A,B,C\}$, we can formalize this by defining a cyclic order as a
permutation or linear order on this finite set, under the equivalence relation
where $A\succ B\succ C$ is identified with both $B\succ C\succ A$ and $C\succ
A\succ B$. As with other collections of sets with some structure, we might want
to aggregate preferences of a (possibly different) set of voters on the set of
possible ways to choose a cyclic order.
  However, given the combinatorial explosion of the number of full rankings of
cyclic orders, one may not wish to use the usual voting machinery. This raises
the question of what sort of ballots may be appropriate; a single cyclic order,
a set of them, or some other ballot type? Further, there is a natural action of
the group of permutations on the set of agents. A reasonable requirement for a
choice procedure would be to respect this symmetry (the equivalent of
neutrality in normal voting theory).
  In this paper we will exploit the representation theory of the symmetric
group to analyze several natural types of ballots for voting on cyclic orders,
and points-based procedures using such ballots. We provide a full
characterization of such procedures for two quite different ballot types for
$n=4$, along with the most important observations for $n=5$.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac3286",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Close encounters between two initially unbound objects can result in a binary
system if enough energy is released as gravitational waves (GWs). We address
the scenario in which such encounters occur in merging elliptical galaxies.
There is evidence that elliptical galaxies can harbor intermediate-mass black
holes. Therefore, these systems are potentially the breeding grounds of sources
of gravitational waves corresponding to inspiraling compact objects onto a
massive black hole due to the dynamics, the large densities, and the number of
compact remnants they contain. We show that this process is efficient for
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses ranging from M $\in
(10^3,10^5)$ M$_{\odot}$ and results in the formation of intermediate
mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs). We consider a set of IMBHs and smaller black
holes with masses $m_2 \in (10,10^3)$ M$_{\odot}$ to estimate the IMRI
formation rate. We find rates ranging between 10$^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$, and
10$^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, and the IMRI formation rate per comoving volume in merging
galaxies as a function of the redshift. The peak frequencies of the
gravitational radiation emitted when these IMRIs are formed are within the
detection band of space-borne detectors such as LISA and TianQin; taking into
account the observable volume of these detectors, the total amount of IMRI
detections per year is significant.

and rotation is included as a non-inertial effect. I argue that since spin
polarization induced by thermal vorticity can be obtained in a classical
theory, it can not be dominated by quantum anomalies.
  Second, the spin polarization induced by magnetic field is obtained for a
fluid at local thermal equilibrium using statistical quantum field theory. The
obtained formula is valid beyond the weak field approximation and when
contributions from the non-homogeneity of the magnetic field are small. The
exact form of spin polarization is studied for a free Dirac field at global

crystal and conventional spin-ice with pinch points associated with a Coulomb
phase. In our experimental demagnetised systems, broken symmetry forces
formation of ferromagnetic stripes upon the surface, a configuration that
forbids the formation of the lower energy double-charged monopole crystal.
Instead, we observe crystallites of single magnetic charge, superimposed upon
an ice background. The crystallites are found to form due to the intricate
distribution of magnetic charge around a three-dimensional nanostructured

fusion modules with a single contiguous module with shared latent space
embedding, from which one extracts a human-interpretable representation of the
scene. One of the most popular representations is the Birds-eye View (BEV),
which expresses the location of different traffic participants in the ego
vehicle frame from a top-down view. However, a BEV does not capture the
chromatic appearance information of the participants. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel representation that captures various traffic
participants appearance and occupancy information from an array of monocular
cameras covering 360 deg field of view (FOV). We use a learned image embedding
of all camera images to generate a BEV of the scene at any instant that
captures both appearance and occupancy of the scene, which can aid in
downstream tasks such as object tracking and executing language-based commands.
We test the efficacy of our approach on synthetic dataset generated from CARLA.

statements that affect the value of a variable at a program point for a
specific execution. Despite their many potential uses, applicability is limited
by the fact that they typically cannot scale beyond small-sized applications.
We believe that at the heart of this limitation is the use of memory references
to identify data-dependencies. Particularly, working with memory references
hinders distinct treatment of the code-to-be-sliced (e.g., classes the user has
an interest in) from the rest of the code (including libraries and frameworks).
The ability to perform a coarser-grained analysis for the code that is not
under focus may provide performance gains and could become one avenue toward
scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that completely
replaces memory reference registering and processing with a memory analysis
model that works with program symbols (i.e., terms). In fact, this approach
enables the alternative of not instrumenting -- thus, not generating any trace
-- for code that is not part of the code-to-be-sliced. We report on an
implementation of an abstract dynamic slicer for C\#, \textit{DynAbs}, and an
evaluation that shows how large and relevant parts of Roslyn and Powershell --

an efficient and accurate multiscale framework for SDT simulations of EM. We
introduce a new approach for SDT simulation by using deep learning to model the
mesoscale energy localization of shock-initiated EM microstructures. The
proposed multiscale modeling framework is divided into two stages. First, a
physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) is used to model
the mesoscale energy localization of shock-initiated heterogeneous EM
microstructures. PARC is trained using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of
hotspot ignition and growth within microstructures of pressed HMX material
subjected to different input shock strengths. After training, PARC is employed
to supply hotspot ignition and growth rates for macroscale SDT simulations. We
show that PARC can play the role of a surrogate model in a multiscale
simulation framework, while drastically reducing the computation cost and
providing improved representations of the sub-grid physics. The proposed
multiscale modeling approach will provide a new tool for material scientists in
designing high-performance and safer energetic materials.

differences between this local halo and the stellar halo in its entirety. We
construct a composite stellar halo model by combining observationally motivated
N-body simulations of the Milky Way's nine most massive disrupted dwarf
galaxies that account for almost all of the mass in the halo. We find that (1)
the representation by mass of different dwarf galaxies in the local halo
compared to the whole halo can be significantly overestimated (e.g., the Helmi
Streams) or underestimated (e.g., Cetus) and (2) properties of the overall halo
(e.g., net rotation) inferred via orbit integration of local halo stars are
significantly biased, because e.g., highly retrograde debris from
Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus is missing from the local halo. Therefore,
extrapolations from the local to the global halo should be treated with
caution. From analysis of a sample of 11 MW-like simulated halos, we identify a
population of recently accreted ($\lesssim5$ Gyrs) and disrupted galaxies on
high angular momenta orbits that are entirely missing from local samples, and
awaiting discovery in the outer halo. Our results motivate the need for surveys

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2103.08146",,,,"nucl-th hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The equation of state (EoS) of QCD is a crucial input for the modeling of
heavy-ion-collision (HIC) and neutron-star-merger systems. Calculations of the
fundamental theory of QCD, which could yield the true EoS, are hindered by the
infamous Fermi sign problem which only allows direct simulations at zero or
imaginary baryonic chemical potential. As a direct consequence, the current
coverage of the QCD phase diagram by lattice simulations is limited. In these
proceedings, two different equations of state based on first-principle lattice
QCD (LQCD) calculations are discussed. The first is solely informed by the
fundamental theory by utilizing all available diagonal and non-diagonal
susceptibilities up to $\mathcal{O}(\mu_B^4)$ in order to reconstruct a full
EoS at finite baryon number, electric charge and strangeness chemical
potentials. For the second, we go beyond information from the lattice in order
to explore the conjectured phase structure, not yet determined by LQCD methods,
to assist the experimental HIC community in their search for the critical
point. We incorporate critical behavior into this EoS by relying on the
principle of universality classes, of which QCD belongs to the 3D Ising Model.
This allows one to study the effects of a singularity on the thermodynamical
quantities that make up the equation of state used for hydrodynamical
simulations of HICs. Additionally, we ensure that these EoSs are valid for
applications to HICs by enforcing conditions of strangeness neutrality and
fixed charge-to-baryon-number ratio.

pressure in the HRG model are imposed. On the other hand, we also apply
excluded-volume corrections, which ensure there is no overlap of baryons by
turning on repulsive (anti)baryon-(anti)baryon interactions. We emphasize the
complementary nature of these two extensions and identify combinations of
conserved charge susceptibilities that allow us to constrain them separately.
In particular, we find interesting ratios of susceptibilities that are
sensitive to one correction and not the other. This allows us to constrain the
excluded volume and particle spectrum effects separately. Analysis of the
available lattice results suggests the presence of both the extra states in the
baryon-strangeness sector and the repulsive baryonic interaction, with
indications that hyperons have a smaller repulsive core than non-strange
baryons. We note that these results are interesting for heavy-ion-collision
systems at both the LHC and RHIC.

In the steady-state spectra, resonances originating from IR-active phonons of

understanding as the violent supernova explosion that forms the pulsar
presumably destabilizes the system. Type II supernova explosions lead to the
formation of eccentric bound systems, free-floating planets, neutron stars,
pulsars, and white dwarfs. Analytical and numerical studies of high mass-loss
rate systems based on perturbation theory so far have focused mainly on
planet-star systems. In this paper, we extend our understanding of the fate of
planet-star and binary systems by assuming a homologous envelope expansion
model using a plausible ejection velocity ($1000-10000\,\mathrm{km/s}$),
envelope- and neutron star masses. The investigation covers secondary masses of
1-10MJup for planetary, and 1-20MSun for stellar companions. We conduct and
analyze over 2.5 million simulations assuming different semi-major axes (2.23 -
100au), eccentricities (0-0.8), and true-anomalies (0-2pi) for the companion.
In a homologous expansion scenario, we confirm that the most probable outcome
of the explosion is the destabilization of the system, while the retention of a
bound system requires a highly eccentric primordial orbit. In general, a higher
ejecta velocity results in a lower eccentricity orbit independent of secondary
mass. The explanation of close-in pulsar planets requires exotic formation
scenarios, rather than survival through the type II supernova explosion model.
Post-explosion bound star systems gain a peculiar velocity (<100\,km/s), even
though the explosion model is symmetric. The applied numerical model allows us
to derive velocity components for dissociating systems. The peculiar velocities
of free-floating planets and stellar corpses are in the range of 10^-6-275km/s.

by [Charikar, Fagin, Guruswami, Kleinberg, Raghavan, Sahai (CFGKRS), STOC

infinite) costs. The goal is to find a sorting algorithm with small competitive
ratio, defined as the (worst-case) ratio of the algorithm's cost to the cost of
the cheapest proof of the sorted order.
  1) When all costs are in $\{0,1,n,\infty\}$, we give an algorithm that has
$\widetilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ competitive ratio. Our result refutes the hypothesis
that a widely cited $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on the competitive ratio for
finding the maximum extends to sorting. This lower bound by [Gupta, Kumar, FOCS
2000] uses costs in $\{0,1,n, \infty\}$ and was claimed as the reason why
sorting with arbitrary costs seemed bleak and hopeless. Our algorithm also
generalizes the algorithms for generalized sorting (all costs in
$\{1,\infty\}$), a version initiated by [Huang, Kannan, Khanna, FOCS 2011] and
addressed recently by [Kuszmaul, Narayanan, FOCS 2021].
  2) We answer the problem of bichromatic sorting posed by [CFGKRS]: We are
given two sets $A$ and $B$ of total size $n$, and the cost of an $A-A$
comparison or a $B-B$ comparison is higher than an $A-B$ comparison. The goal
is to sort $A \cup B$. An $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound on competitive ratio
follows from unit-cost sorting. We give a randomized algorithm with an
almost-optimal w.h.p. competitive ratio of $O(\log^{3} n)$.
  We also study generalizations of the problem \emph{universal sorting} and
\emph{bipartite sorting} (a generalization of nuts-and-bolts). Here, we define
a notion of \textit{instance optimality}, and develop an algorithm for
bipartite sorting which is $O(\log^{3} n)$ instance-optimal. Our framework of
instance optimality applies to other static problems and may be of independent

predictive ability and parameter transferability of advanced association
models, such as those derived from the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory
(SAFT). Indeed, several results in the literature have suggested that this
approach can be useful to accurately describe a given family/series of
homologous compounds and their mixtures, with accuracies competitive (and in
some cases better) than those obtained using the more traditional SAFT
variants. However, the parameter transferability of the different groups, i.e.
between different families of compounds, without the introduction of new groups
or refitting existing ones, is seldom reported, and often overlooked, making an
accurate evaluation of the heteronuclear models difficult. This work analyzes
whether the increased complexity of a heteronuclear treatment of a SAFT-type
EoS, namely the SAFT-{\gamma}-Mie EoS, results in a significant increase on
both the predictive ability and parameter transferability of the model, across
different families of compounds. This is done by using a case study involving
some different (yet related) families of compounds, containing a small number
of common functional groups. The results obtained show that the transferability
of group parameters, across different families of compounds, in a heteronuclear
SAFT-type EoS does not allow an adequate description of the phase equilibria of
these systems. Therefore, to achieve a reasonable accuracy in the description
of these systems, a specific refitting of group parameters is required for a
given family, or even for a particular system, destroying the predictive
capability of these models. Moreover, this increases the number of adjustable
parameters to numbers similar to those used in homonuclear approaches, further
reducing the advantages of using heteronuclear models.

and its recent 21st century acceleration in the satellite record. At regional
scale, the evolution of sea level probability distributions is often assumed to
be dominated by changes in the mean. However, a quantification of changes in
distributional shapes in a changing climate is currently missing. To this end,
we propose a novel framework quantifying significant changes in probability
distributions from time series data. The framework first quantifies linear
trends in quantiles through quantile regression. Quantile slopes are then
projected onto a set of four $orthogonal$ polynomials quantifying how such
changes can be explained by $independent$ shifts in the first four statistical
moments. The framework proposed is theoretically founded, general and can be
applied to any climate observable with close-to-linear changes in
distributions. We focus on observations and a coupled climate model (GFDL-CM4).
In the historical period, trends in coastal daily sea level have been driven
mainly by changes in the mean and can therefore be explained by a shift of the
distribution with no change in shape. In the modeled world, robust changes in
higher order moments emerge with increasing CO2 concentration. Such changes are
driven in part by ocean circulation alone and get amplified by sea level
pressure fluctuations, with possible consequences for sea level extremes

type of galaxies in the early Universe and the galaxy merger rate is dominated

second is in an early-stage merger with interacting galaxies having established
a tidal bridge. Both objects have dual, luminous X-ray sources that are most

infrared counterparts, with colors consistent with being AGN. Follow-up

dislocations and thus are promising for the direct control of plasticity. In
this study, atomistic simulations are used to model the effect of linear
complexions on dislocation-based mechanisms for plasticity, demonstrating
unique behaviors that differ from classical dislocation glide mechanisms.
Linear complexions impart higher resistance to the initiation and continuation
of dislocation motion when compared to solid solution strengthening in all of
the face-centered cubic alloys investigated here, with the exact strengthening
level determined by the linear complexion type. Stacking fault linear
complexions impart the most pronounced strengthening effect, as the dislocation
core is delocalized, and initiation of plastic flow requires a dislocation
nucleation event. The nanoparticle and platelet array linear complexions impart
strengthening by acting as pinning sites for the dislocations, where the
dislocations unpin one at a time through bowing mechanisms. For the
nanoparticle arrays, this event occurs even though the obstacles do not cross
the slip plane and instead only interact through modification of the
dislocation's stress field. The bowing modes observed in the current work
appear similar to traditional Orowan bowing around classical precipitates but
differ in a number of important ways depending on the complexion type. As a
whole, this study demonstrates that linear complexions are a unique tool for
microstructure engineering that can allow for the creation of alloys with new
plastic deformation mechanisms and extreme strength.

are built upon the stochastic kinetic and thermal models for stellar feedback
used in the OWLS and EAGLE simulations, respectively. In the thermal channel,
the energy is distributed statistically isotropically and injected
stochastically in large amounts per event, which minimizes spurious radiative
energy losses. In the kinetic channel, we inject the energy in small portions
by kicking gas particles in pairs in opposite directions. The implementation of
kinetic feedback is designed to conserve energy, linear and angular momentum,
and is statistically isotropic. To test the model, we run simulations of
isolated Milky Way-mass and dwarf galaxies, in which the gas is allowed to cool
down to 10 K. Using the thermal and kinetic channels together, we obtain smooth
star formation histories and powerful galactic winds with realistic mass
loading factors. Furthermore, the model produces spatially resolved star
formation rates (SFRs) and velocity dispersions that are in agreement with
observations. We vary the numerical resolution by several orders of magnitude
and find excellent convergence of the global SFRs and wind mass loading. We
show that large thermal-energy injections generate a hot phase of the ISM and
modulate the star formation by ejecting gas from the disc, while the low-energy

However, the performance of deep methods often falls behind the shallow ones on

while shallow models might suffice for accurately representing the structure of
the simple KGs.
  In this paper, we propose a neural network based model, named DeepE, to
address the problem, which stacks multiple building blocks to predict the tail
entity based on the head entity and the relation. Each building block is an
addition of a linear and a non-linear function. The stacked building blocks are
equivalent to a group of learning functions with different non-linear depth.
Hence, DeepE allows deep functions to learn deep features, and shallow
functions to learn shallow features. Through extensive experiments, we find
DeepE outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods. A major advantage of
DeepE is the robustness. DeepE achieves a Mean Rank (MR) score that is 6%, 30%,

A species percolates and/or the blocked sites X (those with at least one A and
one B nearest neighbor) percolate. Analysis of the size-distribution exponent
$\tau$, the wrapping probabilities, and the excess cluster number shows that
the percolation transition is consistent with that of ordinary percolation. We
obtain an exact result for the low $x_B = 1 - x_A$ jamming behavior: $\theta_A
= 1 - x_B +b_2 x_B^2+\mathcal{O}(x_B^3)$, $\theta_B =
x_B/(z+1)+\mathcal{O}(x_B^2)$ for a $z$-coordinated lattice, where $\theta_A$
and $\theta_B$ are respectively the saturation coverages of species A and B. We
also show how differences between wrapping probabilities of A and X clusters,
as well as differences in the number of A and X clusters, can be used to find
the transition point accurately. For the one-dimensional case a three-site
approximation appears to provide exact results for the coverages.

capable of beginning streaming from a random initialization, making base

theoretical convergence guarantees to be derived using analysis of the Neural

existing baselines for streaming learning in experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet,

accurately accounts for the dominant ISM cooling and heating processes in the

photoelectric heating, H$_2$ heating/cooling, cosmic-ray heating, H/He cooling,
metal-line cooling, CO cooling, and dust cooling (recombination and gas-grain
collisions). We validate the model by comparing 1D equilibrium simulations
across six dex in metallicity to existing 1D ISM models in the literature. We
apply PRISM to high-resolution (4.5 pc) isolated dwarf galaxy simulations that
include state-of-the-art models for star formation and stellar feedback to take
an inventory of which cooling and heating processes dominate each different gas
phase of a galaxy and to understand the importance of non-equilibrium effects.
We show that most of the ISM gas is either close to thermal equilibrium or
exhibits a slight cooling instability, while from a chemical perspective, the
non-equilibrium electron fraction is often more than three times higher or
lower than the equilibrium value, which impacts cooling, heating, and
observable emission lines. Electron enhancements are attributed to
recombination lags while deficits are shown to be due to rapid cosmic-ray
heating. The PRISM model and its coupling to RAMSES-RTZ is applicable to a wide

method for recursive maximum likelihood particle filtering for general

incomplete observations of the systems. Score function and conditional observed
information of the incomplete observations/data are introduced and their
distributional properties are discussed. Some identities concerning the score
function and information matrices of the incomplete data are derived. Maximum
likelihood estimation of state-vector is presented in terms of the score
function and observed information matrices. In particular, to deal with
nonlinear state-space, a sequential Monte Carlo method is developed. It is
given recursively by an EM-gradient-particle filtering which extends the work
of Lange (1995) for state estimation. To derive covariance matrix of
state-estimation errors, an explicit form of observed information matrix is
proposed. It extends Louis (1982) general formula for the same matrix to
state-vector estimation. Under (Neumann) boundary conditions of state
transition probability distribution, the inverse of this matrix coincides with
the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the covariance matrix of estimation errors of
unbiased state-estimator. In the case of linear models, the method shows that
the Kalman filter is a fully efficient state estimator whose covariance matrix
of estimation error coincides with the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Some numerical
examples are discussed to exemplify the main results.

to form a seed disc in time $t_c$, that evolves due to the mass gain from the
infalling debris at the constant outer radius with a mass fallback rate
$\dot{M}_{\rm fb}$ and the mass loss through accretion onto the black hole. The
viscous stress in our model depends on gas ($P_g$) and total ($P_t$) pressures
as $\tau_{r\phi} \propto P_g^{1-\mu} P_t^{\mu}$, where $\mu$ is a constant. We
find that the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_a$ evolves from Eddington to
sub-Eddington accretion with a late-time evolution close to $t^{-5/3}$, where
$t$ is the time. We find that the bolometric disc luminosity follows a
late-time evolution close to $t^{-5/3}$. The ratio of total X-ray luminosity
from corona to bolometric disc luminosity increases with $\mu$ and increases at
late times for $\mu \neq 1$. We obtain the X-ray blackbody temperature of the
disc that agrees with the temperature from X-ray observations ($\sim~10^5~{\rm

decreases for a disc when the corona is included. We have neglected the
outflow, and our model is more applicable for near-to-sub-Eddington accretion

methods, based on the Arnoldi algorithm. When setting up these methods, several
computational parameters must be chosen, which affect intrinsic errors of the
procedure, such as the truncation errors, the discretization error of the flow
solver, the error associated with the nonlinear terms of the Navier-Stokes
equations and the error associated with the limited size of the approximation
of the Jacobian matrix. This paper develops theoretical equations for the
estimation of optimal balance between accuracy and cost for each case. The 2D
open cavity flow is used both for explaining the effect of the parameters on
the accuracy and the cost of the solution, and for verifying the quality of the
predictions. The equations demonstrate the impact of each parameter on the
quality of the solution. For example, if higher order methods are used for
approaching a Fr\'echet derivative in the procedure, it is shown that the
solution deteriorates more rapidly for larger grids or less accurate flow
solvers. On the other hand, lower order approximations are more sensitive to
the initial disturbance magnitude. Nevertheless, for accurate flow solvers and
moderate grid dimensions, first order Fr\'echet derivative approximation with
optimal computational parameters can provide 5 decimal place accurate
eigenvalues. It is further shown that optimal parameters based on accuracy tend
to also lead to the most cost-effective solution. The predictive equations,

  the TSP","Comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome!",,,,"cs.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A long-standing conjecture for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) states
that the integrality gap of the standard linear programming relaxation of the
TSP is at most 4/3. Despite significant efforts, the conjecture remains open.
  We consider the half-integral case, in which the LP has solution values in
$\{0, 1/2, 1\}$. Such instances have been conjectured to be the most difficult
instances for the overall four-thirds conjecture. Karlin, Klein, and Oveis
Gharan, in a breakthrough result, were able to show that in the half-integral
case, the integrality gap is at most 1.49993. This result led to the first
significant progress on the overall conjecture in decades; the same authors
showed the integrality gap is at most $1.5- 10^{-36}$ in the non-half-integral
case. For the half-integral case, the current best-known ratio is 1.4983, a
result by Gupta et al.
  With the improvements on the 3/2 bound remaining very incremental even in the
half-integral case, we turn the question around and look for a large class of
half-integral instances for which we can prove that the 4/3 conjecture is
correct.
  The previous works on the half-integral case perform induction on a hierarchy
of critical tight sets in the support graph of the LP solution, in which some
of the sets correspond to ""cycle cuts"" and the others to ""degree cuts"". We show
that if all the sets in the hierarchy correspond to cycle cuts, then we can
find a distribution of tours whose expected cost is at most 4/3 times the value
of the half-integral LP solution; sampling from the distribution gives us a
randomized 4/3-approximation algorithm. We note that the known bad cases for
the integrality gap have a gap of 4/3 and have a half-integral LP solution in
which all the critical tight sets in the hierarchy are cycle cuts; thus our
result is tight.

problems over finite fields. These faster algorithms, which only use arithmetic
operations and lookup table operations, may help to explain the difficulty of

  The Walsh-Hadamard transform of a vector of length $N$ can be computed using
$O(N \log N / \log \log N)$ bit operations. This generalizes to any transform
defined as a Kronecker power of a fixed matrix. By comparison, the Fast
Walsh-Hadamard transform (similar to the Fast Fourier transform) uses $O(N \log
N)$ arithmetic operations, which is believed to be optimal up to constant
factors.
  Any algebraic algorithm for multiplying two $N \times N$ matrices using
$O(N^\omega)$ operations can be converted into an algorithm using $O(N^\omega /
(\log N)^{\omega/2 - 1})$ bit operations. For example, Strassen's algorithm can
be converted into an algorithm using $O(N^{2.81} / (\log N)^{0.4})$ bit
operations. It remains an open problem with practical implications to determine
the smallest constant $c$ such that Strassen's algorithm can be implemented to

range and location estimation errors due to the clock asynchronism between the

time-varying time offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO), leading to
major challenges in uplink sensing. Unlike existing technologies, our scheme
does not require knowing the location of the UE in advance, and retains the
linearity of the sensing parameter estimation problem. We first estimate the
angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) of multipaths and use them to spatially filter the
CSI. Then, we propose a KF-based CSI enhancer that exploits the estimation of
Doppler with CFO as the prior information to significantly suppress the
time-varying noise-like TO terms in spatially filtered CSIs. Subsequently, we
can estimate the accurate ranges of UE and the scatterers based on the
KF-enhanced CSI. Finally, we identify the UE's AoA and range estimation and
locate UE, then locate the dumb scatterers using the bi-static system.
Simulation results validate the proposed scheme. The localization root mean
square error of the proposed method is about 20 dB lower than the benchmarking
scheme.

occurring in systems of interacting bosons immersed in a disordered

the transition obeys conventional scaling at quantum critical points (QCPs):
this scaling would lock the value of the crossover exponent $\phi$ -- dictating
the vanishing of the superfluid critical temperature upon approaching the QCP
-- to the value of quantum critical exponents for the ground-state transition.
Yet such a relation between exponents has been called into question by several
numerical as well as experimental results on the SF-BG transition. Here we
revisit this issue in the case of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a
site-diluted cubic lattice, which lends itself to efficient quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. Our results show that the model exhibits a percolation transition
in zero applied field, with the correlation length exponent $\nu = 0.87(8)$ and
$\phi = 1.1(1)$ consistent with 3d percolation. When applying a sufficiently
strong magnetic field, the dilution-induced transition decouples from geometric
percolation, and it becomes a SF-BG transition; nonetheless, the $\nu$ and
$\phi$ exponents maintain values consistent with those of the percolation
transition. These results contradict the conventional scaling, which predicts
$\phi\geqslant 2$; and they suggest a close connection between the SF-BG
transition and percolation.

developed optimal procedures of data analysis for both cases using Global

First, we find 13 AutoML topics that we group into four categories. The MLOps
topic category (43% questions) is the largest, followed by Model (28%
questions), Data (27% questions), Documentation (2% questions). Second, Most
questions are asked during Model training (29%) (i.e., implementation phase)

opportunity to constrain the dense-matter equation of state. Although it is
known from quantum chromodynamics that hadronic matter will undergo a phase
transition to exotic forms of matter, e.g., quark matter, the onset density of
such a phase transition cannot be computed from first principles. Hence, it
remains an open question if such phase transitions occur inside isolated
neutron stars or during binary neutron star mergers, or if they appear at even
higher densities that are not realized in the Cosmos. In this article, we
perform numerical-relativity simulations of neutron-star mergers and
investigate scenarios in which the onset density of such a phase transition is
exceeded in at least one inspiralling binary component. Our simulations reveal
that shortly before the merger it is possible that such stars undergo a
""reverse phase transition"", i.e., densities decrease and the quark core inside
the star disappears leaving a purely hadronic star at merger. After the merger,
when densities increase once more, the phase transition occurs again and leads,
in the cases considered in this work, to a rapid formation of a black hole. We
compute the gravitational-wave signal and the mass ejection for our simulations
of such scenarios and find clear signatures that are related to the post-merger
phase transition, e.g., smaller ejecta masses due to the softening of the
equation of state through the quark core formation. Unfortunately, we do not
find measurable imprints of the reverse phase transition.

We calculate the spin-flip probability of qubit driven by composite pulses,

When composite pulses and RTN act in x-direction and z-direction respectively,

We report the shortcut of spin-flip qubit, which can be achieved by using
C-pulse, followed by BP-pulse and QW-pulse. When jumps time in RTN are very
fast, tuning of perfect fidelity or spin-flip probability extends to large RTN
correlation time. On the other hand, when the jumps in RTN are very slow, the
BP-pulse can be used to recover the lost fidelities. Nevertheless, the
fidelities of qubit gate operation are larger than 90%, regardless of RTN jumps
environments which may be beneficial in quantum error correction. For more
general case, we have tested several pulse sequences for achieving high
fidelity quantum gates, where we have used the pulses acting in different
directions. From the calculations, we find high fidelity of qubit gate

results show that this model reduces the root mean square error in predicting
HV velocity by 35.64\% compared to the nominal model. Utilizing this model, a

building reduced order models (ROM) by analytical methods. In recent years,
there is a surge of interest in developing ROM using data-driven or
computational tools that offer more applicability and flexibility. This paper
is a work towards that direction.
  Motivated by our previous work of designing ROM for the stationary radiative
transfer equation in [30] by leveraging the low-rank structure of the solution
manifold induced by the angular variable, we here further advance the
methodology to the time-dependent model. Particularly, we take the celebrated
reduced basis method (RBM) approach and propose a novel micro-macro decomposed
reduced basis method (MMD-RBM). The MMD-RBM is constructed by exploiting, in a
greedy fashion, the low-rank structures of both the micro- and macro-solution
manifolds with respect to the angular and temporal variables. Our reduced order
surrogate consists of: reduced bases for reduced order subspaces and a reduced
quadrature rule in the angular space. The proposed MMD-RBM features several
structure-preserving components: 1) an equilibrium-respecting strategy to
construct reduced order subspaces which better utilize the structure of the
decomposed system, and 2) a recipe for preserving positivity of the quadrature
weights thus to maintain the stability of the underlying reduced solver. The
resulting ROM can be used to achieve a fast online solve for the angular flux
in angular directions outside the training set and for arbitrary order moment
of the angular flux.

requires dynamic data and control dependencies that arise in an execution.
During a single execution, memory reference information is recorded and then
traversed to extract dependencies. Execute-once approaches and tools are
challenged even by executions of moderate size of simple and short programs. We
propose to shift practical time complexity from execution size to slice size.
In particular, our approach executes the program multiple times while tracking

follows an on-demand re-execution paradigm that uses a novel concept of
frontier dependency to incrementally build a dynamic slice. To focus dependency

Therefore, the redshift determination exercise is crucial to indirectly placing
tight constraints on the EBL density and to studying blazar population
evolution across cosmic time. Due to the powerful relativistic jets in blazars,
most of their host galaxies' spectral features are outshined, and dedicated
high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations are required. Deep medium- to

liquid-state ferroelectric that would carry many possibilities of spatially
distributed polarization fields. Contrary to traditional magnetic or
crystalline systems, anisotropic liquid crystal interactions can compete with
the polarization counterparts, thereby setting a challenge in understating
their interplays and the resultant topologies. Here, we discover chiral
polarization meron-like structures during the emergence and growth of quasi-2D
ferroelectric nematic domains, which are visualized by fluorescence confocal
polarizing microscopy and second harmonic generation microscopies. Such
micrometre-scale polarization textures are the modified electric variants of
the magnetic merons. Unlike the conventional liquid crystal textures driven
solely by the elasticity, the polarization field puts additional topological
constraints, e.g., head-to-tail asymmetry, to the systems and results in a
variety of previously unidentified polar topological patterns. The chirality
can emerge spontaneously in polar textures and can be additionally biased by
introducing chiral dopants. An extended mean-field modelling for the
ferroelectric nematics reveals that the polarization strength of systems plays
a dedicated role in determining polarization topology, providing a guide for
exploring diverse polar textures in strongly-polarized liquid crystals.

  Yan","NoiSER: Noise is All You Need for Low-Light Image Enhancement",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present an embarrassingly simple yet effective solution to
a seemingly impossible mission, low-light image enhancement (LLIE) without
access to any task-related data. The proposed solution, Noise SElf-Regression
(NoiSER), simply learns a convolutional neural network equipped with a
instance-normalization layer by taking a random noise image,
$\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ for each pixel, as both input and output for each
training pair, and then the low-light image is fed to the learned network for
predicting the normal-light image. Technically, an intuitive explanation for
its effectiveness is as follows: 1) the self-regression reconstructs the
contrast between adjacent pixels of the input image, 2) the
instance-normalization layers may naturally remediate the overall
magnitude/lighting of the input image, and 3) the $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$
assumption for each pixel enforces the output image to follow the well-known
gray-world hypothesis \cite{Gary-world_Hypothesis} when the image size is big
enough, namely, the averages of three RGB components of an image converge to
the same value. Compared to existing SOTA LLIE methods with access to different
task-related data, NoiSER is surprisingly highly competitive in enhancement
quality, yet with a much smaller model size, and much lower training and
inference cost. With only $\sim$ 1K parameters, NoiSER realizes about 1 minute
for training and 1.2 ms for inference with 600x400 resolution on RTX 2080 Ti.
As a bonus, NoiSER possesses automated over-exposure suppression ability and
shows excellent performance on over-exposed photos.

a rectangular region of interest (ROI). The attention mechanism is used to make
the model focus on the small number of informative slices in a stack. Then the
smallest FOV that makes the neural network predicted ROI free of aliasing is
calculated by an algebraic operation derived from MR sampling theory. We

Expressive-VC, a novel end-to-end voice conversion framework that leverages
advantages from both neural bottleneck feature (BNF) approach and information
perturbation approach. Specifically, we use a BNF encoder and a Perturbed-Wav
encoder to form a content extractor to learn linguistic and para-linguistic
features respectively, where BNFs come from a robust pre-trained ASR model and
the perturbed wave becomes speaker-irrelevant after signal perturbation. We
further fuse the linguistic and para-linguistic features through an attention
mechanism, where speaker-dependent prosody features are adopted as the
attention query, which result from a prosody encoder with target speaker
embedding and normalized pitch and energy of source speech as input. Finally
the decoder consumes the integrated features and the speaker-dependent prosody
feature to generate the converted speech. Experiments demonstrate that
Expressive-VC is superior to several state-of-the-art systems, achieving both
high expressiveness captured from the source speech and high speaker similarity
with the target speaker; meanwhile intelligibility is well maintained.

covariant gravities on the propagation of GWs in the cosmological background
and obtain the observational constraints on coupling coefficients in the action

frequency-independent effects on GW speed and friction, 2) parity-violating
amplitude and velocity birefringences, and 3) a Lorentz-violating damping rate
and dispersion of GWs. With these effects, we calculate the corresponding
modified waveform of GWs generated by the coalescence of compact binaries. By
comparing these new effects with the publicly available posterior samples or
results from various tests of gravities with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data in the

in industry scenes. It is an urgent need to ensure the safety and security of
the control logic models. Test case generation technologies are widely used to
ensure the safety and security. State-of-the-art model testing tools employ
model checking techniques or search-based methods to generate test cases.
Traditional search based techniques based on Simulink simulation are plagued by
problems such as low speed and high overhead. Traditional model checking
techniques such as symbolic execution have limited performance when dealing
with nonlinear elements and complex loops. Recently, coverage guided fuzzing
technologies are known to be effective for test case generation, due to their
high efficiency and impressive effects over complex branches of loops.
  In this paper, we apply fuzzing methods to improve model testing and
demonstrate the effectiveness. The fuzzing methods aim to cover more program
branches by mutating valuable seeds. Inspired by this feature, we propose a
novel integration technology SPsCGF, which leverages bounded model checking for
symbolic execution to generate test cases as initial seeds and then conduct
fuzzing based upon these worthy seeds. In this manner, our work combines the
advantages of the model checking methods and fuzzing techniques in a novel way.
Since the control logic models always receive signal inputs, we specifically
design novel mutation operators for signals to improve the existing fuzzing
method in model testing. Over the evaluated benchmarks which consist of
industrial cases, SPsCGF could achieve 8% to 38% higher model coverage and
3x-10x time efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art works.

theory, we study the relative stability of parallel (L$_{\parallel}$) and
perpendicular (L$_{\perp}$) orientations of BCP lamellar phases, ranging in
chain flexibility from flexible Gaussian chains to semi-flexible and rigid
chains. For flat and neutral bounding surfaces (no surface preference for one
of the two BCP components), the stability of the L$_{\perp}$ lamellae increases
with chain rigidity. When the top surface is flat and the bottom substrate is
corrugated, increasing the surface roughness enhances the stability of the
L$_{\perp}$ lamellae for flexible Gaussian chains. However, an opposite
behavior is observed for rigid chains, where the L$_{\perp}$ stability
decreases as the substrate roughness increases. We further show that as the
substrate roughness increases, the critical value of the substrate preference,
$u^{*}$, corresponding to an L$_{\perp}$-to-L$_{\parallel}$ transition,
decreases for rigid chains, while it increases for flexible Gaussian chains.
Our results highlight the physical mechanism of tailoring the orientation of
lamellar phases in thin-film setups. This is of importance, in particular, for
short (semi-flexible or rigid) chains that are in high demand in emerging
nanolithography and other industrial applications.

monolayers placed in an optical microcavity. The charge tunability leads to an
electron gas with nonzero density that brings brightness to the trion - a
polaron quasiparticle formed by an exciton with a nonzero residue bounded to
the electron gas. As a result, a trion-polariton is created under strong
light-matter coupling, as observed in the recent experiment by Sidler
\textit{et al.} {[}Nat. Phys. \textbf{13}, 255 (2017){]}. We analyze in detail
the structure of trion-polaritons, by solving an extended Chevy ansatz for the
trion quasiparticle wave-function. We confirm that the effective light-matter
coupling for trion-polaritons is determined by the residue of the trion
quasiparticle. The solution of the full many-body polaron states within Chevy
ansatz enables us to microscopically calculate the nonlinear 2DCS spectrum of
both trion-polaritons and exciton-polaritons. We predict the existence of three
kinds of off-diagonal cross-peaks in the 2DCS spectrum, as an indication of the
coherence among the different branches of trion-polaritons and
exciton-polaritons. Due to the sensitivity of 2DCS spectrum to quasiparticle

may follow correlations that are different from those at the on-axis. Here we
present a simple analytical derivation for the Amati relation and the Yonetoku

states represents a major challenge in the pursuit of quantum error correction
(QEC). In a QEC circuit, leakage builds over time and spreads through
multi-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the
exponential suppression of logical error with scale, challenging the
feasibility of QEC as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here,
we demonstrate the execution of a distance-3 surface code and distance-21
bit-flip code on a Sycamore quantum processor where leakage is removed from all
qubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its
ability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a ten-fold reduction
in steady-state leakage population on the data qubits encoding the logical
state and an average leakage population of less than $1 \times 10^{-3}$
throughout the entire device. The leakage removal process itself efficiently
returns leakage population back to the computational basis, and adding it to a
code circuit prevents leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles,
restoring a fundamental assumption of QEC. With this demonstration that leakage
can be contained, we resolve a key challenge for practical QEC at scale.

Specifically, we used unsupervised learning based on finite mixture modelling

pseudo-cohorts ranging in age from approximately 3 to 12 years old. We
discovered that smaller size pseudo-cohorts inhabit relatively high --

Larger size pseudo-cohorts inhabit lower -- tropical to subtropical --

that the current tagging technology is unlikely to capture in full. We discuss

is the loss of translational invariance, in which case the zero eigenvalue of
the linearised operator is geometrically simple. Consequently, the stability

methods are proposed for calculating the residual entropy of frustrated states,
including states at phase boundaries, which are based on the Markov property of
the system and involve solving a linear optimization problem for energy and a
nonlinear optimization problem for entropy. These methods allow obvious
generalizations for one-dimensional pseudospin models with anisotropic
interactions. We calculate the composition, entropy and magnetization for the
ground state phases. We prove the absence of pseudo-transitions in the dilute
Ising chain, since the residual entropy of states at phase boundaries is always
higher than the entropy of adjacent phases. The concentration dependencies of
magnetization at the phase boundaries are obtained, and unlike linear
dependencies for adjacent phases, they have nonlinear behavior. Field-induced
transitions between ground states and entropy jumps associated with them are
also considered, and in particular, it is shown that the field-induced
transition from an antiferromagnetic state to a frustrated one is accompanied

which is then discretized by following characteristics for the transport part
with a backward finite difference semi-Lagrangian approach, while the diffusive
part is discretized implicitly. After the macroscopic density is available, the
distribution function can be efficiently solved even with a fully implicit time
discretization, since all discrete velocities are decoupled, resulting in a
low-dimensional linear system from spatial discretizations at each discrete
velocity. Both first and second order discretizations in space and in time are
considered. The resulting schemes can be shown to be asymptotic preserving (AP)
in the diffusive limit. Uniformly unconditional stabilities are verified from a

LHC comprises the replacement of the current endcap calorimeter by a high
granularity sampling calorimeter (HGCAL). The electromagnetic section of the
HGCAL is based on silicon sensors interspersed between lead and copper (or
copper tungsten) absorbers. The hadronic section uses layers of stainless steel
as an absorbing medium and silicon sensors as an active medium in the regions
of high radiation exposure, and scintillator tiles directly readout by silicon
photomultipliers in the remaining regions. As part of the development of the
detector and its readout electronic components, a section of a silicon-based
HGCAL prototype detector along with a section of the CALICE AHCAL prototype was
exposed to muons, electrons and charged pions in beam test experiments at the
H2 beamline at the CERN SPS in October 2018. The AHCAL uses the same technology
as foreseen for the HGCAL but with much finer longitudinal segmentation. The
performance of the calorimeters in terms of energy response and resolution,
longitudinal and transverse shower profiles is studied using negatively charged
pions, and is compared to GEANT4 predictions. This is the first report
summarizing results of hadronic showers measured by the HGCAL prototype using
beam test data.

sensitive data (e.g., personal, health) for security inspection and assurance.
Since such data operations can be highly sensitive, it is vital to ensure that
the audit log achieves not only validity and immutability, but also
confidentiality against active threats to standard data regulations (e.g.,
HIPAA) compliance. Despite its critical needs, state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving audit log schemes (e.g., Ghostor (NSDI '20), Calypso (VLDB
'19)) do not fully obtain a high level of privacy, integrity, and immutability
simultaneously, in which certain information (e.g., user identities) is still
leaked in the log.
  In this paper, we propose Harpocrates, a new privacy-preserving and immutable
audit log scheme. Harpocrates permits data store, share, and access operations
to be recorded in the audit log without leaking sensitive information (e.g.,
data identifier, user identity), while permitting the validity of data
operations to be publicly verifiable. Harpocrates makes use of blockchain
techniques to achieve immutability and avoid a single point of failure, while
cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs are harnessed for confidentiality and
public verifiability. We analyze the security of our proposed technique and
prove that it achieves non-malleability and indistinguishability. We fully
implemented Harpocrates and evaluated its performance on a real blockchain
system (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric) deployed on a commodity platform (i.e.,
Amazon EC2). Experimental results demonstrated that Harpocrates is highly
scalable and achieves practical performance.

centrally collecting possibly sensitive raw data. This paves the way for
stronger privacy guarantees when building predictive models. The most used
algorithms for FL are parameter-averaging based schemes (e.g., Federated
Averaging) that, however, have well known limits: (i) Clients must implement
the same model architecture; (ii) Transmitting model weights and model updates
implies high communication cost, which scales up with the number of model
parameters; (iii) In presence of non-IID data distributions,
parameter-averaging aggregation schemes perform poorly due to client model
drifts. Federated adaptations of regular Knowledge Distillation (KD) can solve

spectrum of surrounding ground-state atoms and facilitate the excitation of
further atoms into Rydberg states by the photoassociation light. Such an
ion-mediated excitation mechanism has been previously called ""Coulomb
anti-blockade"". Pulsed-field ionisation typically doesn't discriminate between
the ionization of a long-range Rydberg molecule and an isolated Rydberg atom,
and thus the number of atomic ions detected by this mechanism is not
proportional to the number of long-range Rydberg molecules present in the probe
volume. By combining high-resolution UV and RF spectroscopy of a dense,
ultracold gas of cesium atoms, theoretical modeling of the molecular level
structures of long-range Rydberg molecules bound below nP_3/2 Rydberg states of
cesium, and a rate model of the photoassociation and decay processes, we
unambiguously identify the signatures of this detection mechanism in the

that the message can be recovered after additional image processing. One of the
most popular processing operations is JPEG recompression. Unfortunately, most
of today's steganographic methods addressing this issue only provide a
probabilistic guarantee of recovering the secret and are consequently not
errorless. That is unacceptable since even a single unexpected change can make
the whole message unreadable if it is encrypted. We propose to create a robust
set of DCT coefficients by inspecting their behavior during recompression,
which requires access to the targeted JPEG compressor. This is done by dividing
the DCT coefficients into 64 non-overlapping lattices because one embedding
change can potentially affect many other coefficients from the same DCT block
during recompression. The robustness is then combined with standard
steganographic costs creating a lattice embedding scheme robust against JPEG
recompression. Through experiments, we show that the size of the robust set and
the scheme's security depends on the ordering of lattices during embedding. We
verify the validity of the proposed method with three typical JPEG compressors
and benchmark its security for various embedding payloads, three different ways
of ordering the lattices, and a range of Quality Factors. Finally, this method
is errorless by construction, meaning the embedded message will always be

to achieve optimal recognition accuracy in the multi-layer network. The latter
module employs the attention operation to model the dependency between
different entities. In this way, our model could learn better entity
representations by capturing the implicit distinctions and relationships
between different categories of entities. Extensive experiments on public

called jihad, in the process of the reversal of fortune over the centuries. In
West Africa, water access in ancient periods predicts the locations of the core
cities of inland trade routes -- the trans-Saharan caravan routes -- founded up
to the 1800s, when historical Islamic states played significant economic roles
before European colonization. In contrast, ancient water access does not have a
persistent influence on contemporary city formation and economic activities.
After European colonization and the invention of modern trading technologies,
along with the constant shrinking of water sources, landlocked pre-colonial
core cities contracted or became extinct. Employing an instrumental variable
strategy, we show that these deserted locations have today been replaced by
battlefields for jihadist organizations. We argue that the power relations
between Islamic states and the European military during the 19th century
colonial era shaped the persistence of jihadist ideology as a legacy of
colonization. Investigations into religious ideology related to jihadism, using
individual-level surveys from Muslims, support this mechanism. Moreover, the
concentration of jihadist violence in ""past-core-and-present-periphery"" areas
in West Africa is consistent with a global-scale phenomenon. Finally,
spillovers of violent events beyond these stylized locations are partly
explained by organizational heterogeneity among competing factions (Al Qaeda
and the Islamic State) over time.

existence of unexplained dips in the lightcurves of a small fraction of
rapidly-rotating M dwarfs in young open clusters and star-forming regions. We
present a theoretical investigation of one possible explanation - that these
are caused by dust clouds trapped in the stellar magnetic fields. The depth and
duration of the observed dips allow us to estimate directly the linear extent
of the dust clouds and their distances from the rotation axis. The dips are
found to be between 0.4-4.8%. We find that their distance is close to the
co-rotation radius: the typical location for stable points where charged
particles can be trapped in a stellar magnetosphere. We estimate the charge
acquired by a dust particle due to collisions with the coronal gas and hence
determine the maximum grain size that can be magnetically supported, the
stopping distance due to gas drag and the timescale on which dust particles can
diffuse out of a stable point. Using the observationally-derived magnetic field
of the active M dwarf V374 Peg, we model the distribution of these dust clouds
and produce synthetic light curves. We find that for 1 micron dust grains, the
light curves have dips of 1% - 3% and can support masses of order of
$10^{12}$kg. We conclude that magnetically-trapped dust clouds (potentially
from residual disc accretion or tidally-disrupted planetesimal or cometary

imitate a displayed image of a face that portrays a particular basic emotion.
Every round played by the player creates new data that consists of a set of
facial features and landmarks, already annotated with the emotion label of the
target facial expression. Such an approach effectively creates a robust,
sustainable, and continuous machine learning training process. We evaluated
Facegame with an experiment that revealed several contributions to the field of
affective computing. First, the gamified data collection approach allowed us to
access a rich variation of facial expressions of each basic emotion due to the
natural variations in the players' facial expressions and their expressive
abilities. We report improved accuracy when the collected data were used to
enrich well-known in-the-wild facial emotion datasets and consecutively used
for training facial emotion recognition models. Second, the natural language

transformations non-interactively (i.e., post-hoc) with only standard
cryptographic hardness assumptions. Unfortunately, this work does not preserve
input privacy, is impractically slow (working only on 128$\times$128 images),

  To address these issues, we present zk-img, a library for attesting to image
transformations while hiding the pre-transformed image. zk-img allows
application developers to specify high level image transformations. Then,
zk-img will transparently compile these specifications to ZK-SNARKs. To hide
the input or output images, zk-img will compute the hash of the images inside
the ZK-SNARK. We further propose methods of chaining image transformations
securely and privately, which allows for arbitrarily many transformations. By
combining these optimizations, zk-img is the first system to be able to
transform HD images on commodity hardware, securely and privately.

layer throughout the sample starting from the softest parts, i.e., the spring

the sample collapse, which indicates damage spreading instead of localization.
In 3D, one can see a fat-tailed local strain rate distribution, indicating that
inside the softwood layers, the damage occurs in localized spots. The observed

development of independent local collapses or irreversible deformation events.
A key feature in the mechanical behavior of wood is then in the complex

particles from the traditional law of Brownian-motion, is a signature feature
of a large number of complex soft-matter and biological systems.
Anomalous-diffusion emerges due to a variety of physical mechanisms, e.g.,
trapping interactions or the viscoelasticity of the environment. However,
sometimes systems dynamics are erroneously claimed to be anomalous, despite the
fact that the true motion is Brownian -- or vice versa. This ambiguity in
establishing whether the dynamics as normal or anomalous can have far-reaching
consequences, e.g., in predictions for reaction- or relaxation-laws.
Demonstrating that a system exhibits normal- or anomalous-diffusion is highly
desirable for a vast host of applications. Here, we present a criterion for
anomalous-diffusion based on the method of power-spectral analysis of single
trajectories. The robustness of this criterion is studied for trajectories of
fractional-Brownian-motion, a ubiquitous stochastic process for the description
of anomalous-diffusion, in the presence of two types of measurement errors. In
particular, we find that our criterion is very robust for subdiffusion. Various
tests on surrogate data in absence or presence of additional positional noise
demonstrate the efficacy of this method in practical contexts. Finally, we
provide a proof-of-concept based on diverse experiments exhibiting both normal

evolution of a quantum mechanical state is determined by the Schr\""odinger
equation. I propose to replace this postulate with an axiom that is firmly
rooted in the representation theory of the Poincar\'e group: It postulates that
(relativistic) multi-particle systems, as well as single particles, are
described by irreducible unitary representations of the Poincar\'e group. These
representation are characterised by fixed eigenvalues of two Casimir operators.
In multi-particle systems, fixing these eigenvalues leads to correlations
between the particles. In the quasi-classical approximation of large quantum
numbers, these correlations take on the structure of a gravitational
interaction described by the field equations of conformal gravity. A realistic
theoretical value for the gravitational constant is determined.

surface interaction models. Establishing the latter commonly requires a higher
level of abstraction and means to dismiss the fundamental atomic fidelity.
Previous works on sputtering processes addressed this issue by establishing
machine learning surrogate models, which include a basic surface state (i.e.,
stoichiometry) as static input. In this work, an evolving surface state and
defect structure are introduced to jointly describe sputtering and growth with
physics-separating artificial neural networks. The data describing the
plasma-surface interactions stem from hybrid reactive molecular
dynamics/time-stamped force bias Monte Carlo simulations of Al neutrals and
Ar$^+$ ions impinging onto Al(001) surfaces. It is demonstrated that the
fundamental processes are comprehensively described by taking the surface state
as well as defect structure into account. Hence, a machine learning
plasma-surface interaction surrogate model is established that resolves the
inherent kinetics with high physical fidelity. The resulting model is not
restricted to input from modeling and simulation, but may similarly be applied
to experimental input data.

represented by an oracle, in time $n^{\mathcal{O}(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ finds a
cycle $C$ in $G$ with $f(C)\leq (1+\varepsilon)\cdot \textsf{OPT}$. This is in
sharp contrast with the non-approximability of the closely related Monotone
Submodular Shortest $(s,t)$-Path problem, which requires exponentially many
queries to the oracle for finding an $n^{2/3-\varepsilon}$-approximation [Goel
et al., FOCS 2009]. We complement our algorithm with a matching lower bound. We
show that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, obtaining a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation requires at least $n^{\Omega(\log 1/
\varepsilon)}$ queries to the oracle. When the function $f$ is integer-valued,
our algorithm yields that a cycle of cost $\textsf{OPT}$ can be found in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(\log \textsf{OPT})}$. In particular, for
$\textsf{OPT}=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ this gives a quasipolynomial-time algorithm
computing a cycle of minimum submodular cost. Interestingly, while a
quasipolynomial-time algorithm often serves as a good indication that a
polynomial time complexity could be achieved, we show a lower bound that
$n^{\mathcal{O}(\log n)}$ queries are required even when $\textsf{OPT} =

supply-chain management and retailing strategies are crucial for good market

Many displays support high dynamic range (HDR) and 10-bit color depth. Since
high bit-depth is an emerging technology, video content is still largely shot

Insufficient bit-depths produce distortions called false contours or banding,
and they are visible on high contrast screens. To deal with such distortions,
researchers have proposed algorithms for bit-depth enhancement
(dequantization). Such techniques convert videos with low bit-depth (LBD) to
videos with high bit-depth (HBD). The quality of converted LBD video, however,
is usually lower than that of the original HBD video, and many consumers prefer
to keep the original HBD versions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to
determine whether a video has undergone conversion before compression. This
problem is complex; it involves detecting outcomes of different dequantization
algorithms in the presence of compression that strongly affects the
least-significant bits (LSBs) in the video frames. Our algorithm can detect
bit-depth enhancement and demonstrates good generalization capability, as it is

The dynamics is studied analytically using the cold plasma model and a
single-particle formalism, and numerically with the inhouse energy and charge
conserving particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions code ECCOPIC1S-M. It is
found that the dynamics differs significantly from that of an unmagnetized

electrode, an enhanced electric field arises during sheath expansion and a
reversed electric field during sheath collapse. Both fields are needed to
ensure discharge sustaining electron transport against the confining effect of
the magnetic field. The corresponding azimuthal ExB-drift can accelerate
electrons into the inelastic energy range which gives rise to a new mechanism
of RF power dissipation. It is related to the Hall current and is different in
nature from Ohmic heating, as which it has been classified in previous

However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light curve evolution more complicated

follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Its synchrotron emission is similar to
that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like
explosion of a He star with a modest (~0.5 - 1 Msun) extended H-rich envelope.
Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the
interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus
suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the `canonical' SN
IIb ejecta) for which the multi-wavelength emission is powered mainly by the
SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity
in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu that showed a flash

  arXiv:2209.02484",,,,"astro-ph.IM physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimetre-wave observations represent an important tool for Cosmology
studies. The Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) technique has been proposed to map in
three dimensions the specific intensity due to line (e.g. [CII], CO) emission,
for example from the primordial galaxies, as a function of redshift.
Hyper-spectral integrated devices have the potential to replace the current
Fourier transform, or the planned Fabry-Perot-based instruments operating at
millimetre and sub-millimetre wavelengths. The aim is to perform hyper-spectral
mapping, with a spectral resolution R = lambda / Delta_lambda = 100 - 1000,
over large, i.e. thousands of beams, instantaneous patches of the Sky. The
innovative integrated device that we have developed allows avoiding moving
parts, complicated and/or dispersive optics or tunable filters to be operated
at cryogenics temperatures. The prototype hyper-spectral focal plane is
sensitive in the 80-90~GHz range and contains nineteen horns for sixteen
spectral-imaging channels, each selecting a frequency band of about 0.1~GHz. A
conical horn antenna, coupled to a planar superconducting filter, collects the
radiation. A capacitively coupled Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detector
(LEKID) is then in charge of dissipating and sensing the super-current
established in the filter. The prototype is fabricated with only two
photo-lithography steps over a commercial mono-crystalline sapphire substrate.
It exhibits a spectral resolution R = 800. The optical noise equivalent power
is in the observational relevant $10^{-17}~W/\sqrt{Hz}$ range. The device, as
expected from 3-D simulations, is polarisation-sensitive, paving the way to
spectro-polarimetry measurements over very large instantaneous field-of-views.

Both of these factors are clinically relevant for the assessment of multiple

phenomena in non-magnetic systems where certain spatial symmetries are reduced
or absent. Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), a term that generically
refers to a spin-dependent electron transfer in non-magnetic chiral systems, is
one such case, appearing in a variety of seemingly unrelated situations ranging
from inorganic materials to molecular devices. In particular, the origin of
CISS in molecular junctions is a matter of an intense current debate. Here we
derive a set of geometrical conditions for this effect to appear, hinting at
the fundamental role of symmetries beyond otherwise relevant quantitative
issues. Our approach, which draws on the use of point-group symmetries within
the scattering formalism for transport, shows that electrode symmetries are as
important as those of the molecule when it comes to the emergence of a
spin-polarization and, by extension, to the possible appearance of CISS. It
turns out that standalone metallic nanocontacts can exhibit spin-polarization
when relative rotations which reduce the symmetry are introduced. As a
corollary, molecular junctions with $\textbf{achiral}$ molecules can also
exhibit spin-polarization along the direction of transport, provided that the
whole junction is chiral in a specific way. This formalism also allows the
prediction of qualitative changes of the spin-polarization upon substitution of
a chiral molecule in the junction with its enantiomeric partner. Quantum
transport calculations based on density functional theory corroborate all of
our predictions and provide further quantitative insight within the
single-particle framework.

transformation is difficult to achieve a satisfactory result. In this paper, we

image from another viewpoint, the 3DFill first aligns the two images by a
two-stage method: 3D projection + 2D transformation, which has better results
than 2D image alignment. The 3D projection is an overall alignment between
images and the 2D transformation is a local alignment focused on the hole
region. The entire process of image alignment is self-supervised. We then fill
the hole in the target image with the contents of the aligned image. Finally,
we use a conditional generation network to refine the filled image to obtain
the inpainting result. 3DFill achieves state-of-the-art performance on image
inpainting across a variety of wide view shifts and has a faster inference
speed than other inpainting models.

show that the density of particles satisfies a law of large numbers with
respect to the NESS, with an explicit rate of convergence, and we also show
that at mesoscopic scales the NESS is well approximated by a local equilibrium
(product) measure, in the total variation distance. In addition, in dimensions
$d \leq3$ we show a central limit theorem (CLT) for the density of particles
under the NESS. The corresponding Gaussian limit can be represented as an
independent sum of a white noise and a massive Gaussian free field, and in
particular it presents macroscopic correlations.

glass condensate effective theory, we consider next-to-leading order (NLO)
corrections to the production of a pair of hadrons in electron-proton, or
electron-nucleus, collisions at small Bjorken $x$. To the order of interest,
the process involves the fluctuation of a virtual photon into a quark-antiquark
pair, followed by the emission of a gluon from either the quark, or the
antiquark. For the case of a virtual photon with transverse polarization, we
compute the real NLO corrections, where the emitted gluon is present in the
final state. We first compute the tree-level cross-section for the production
of the quark-antiquark-gluon system and then deduce the real NLO corrections to
dihadron production by integrating out the kinematics of the gluon. We verify
in detail that, in the limit where the gluon is soft, our calculation
reproduces the (real piece of the) B-JIMWLK evolution of the leading-order
cross-section for quark-antiquark production. Similarly, in the limit where the
gluon is collinear with its emitter, we recover the real terms in the DGLAP
evolution of the fragmentation function. The virtual NLO corrections to
dihadron production will be presented by one of us in a subsequent publication.

the existing approaches to extrapolating the coronal magnetic field and to

reconstructing the evolutionary past of a polyploid dataset generally start
with a multi-labelled tree obtained for a dataset of interest and then derive a
(phylogenetic) network from that tree in some way that reflects that past by
interpreting the networks's vertices of indegree at least two as
polyploidization events. Since obtaining such a tree can be computationally
expensive it is paramount to have alternative approaches available that allow
one to shed light into the reticulate evolutionary past of a polyploid dataset.
SPRINT aims to reconstruct the evolutionary past of a polyploid dataset in
terms of a binary network which realises the dataset's ploidy profile (vector
of ploidy levels of the dataset's taxa) and requires the fewest number of
polyploidization events. It does this by representing the ploidy level of a
species x in terms of the number of directed paths from the root of the network
to the leaf of the network labelled by x. SPRINT is distributed on GitHub:

ultra-clean DWCNTs as tailored hosts to trace the growth of carbyne, which
allows to identify the precursor and unravel the formation mechanism of carbyne
during high-vacuum annealing at high-temperatures. Using this approach,
ultra-clean DWCNTs with 80.4% 13C-enriched inner walls and outer tubes of
naturally abundant served to unambiguously prove that only the carbonaceous
materials inside the DWCNTs can act as precursors. The exchange of C atoms
between inner and outer tubes happens without any growth of carbyne. After
applying a secondary oxidation step, it is possible to produce the carbonaceous
precursors from the partially oxidized DWCNTs. In this manner, not only carbyne
with a record of ~28.8% 13C enrichment is grown, but concomitant healing,
reorganization and regrowth of the DWCNTs occurs. This work enables to identify

segmentation, but merely in static learning, i.e., optimizing the network once
for all, ignoring potential needs for model updating. In real-world scenarios,
new data continues to be gathered from multiple institutions over time and new
demands keep growing to pursue more satisfying performance. The desired model
should incrementally learn from each incoming dataset and progressively update
with improved functionality as time goes by. As the datasets sequentially
delivered from multiple sites are normally heterogenous with domain
discrepancy, each updated model should not catastrophically forget previously
learned domains while well generalizing to currently arrived domains or even
unseen domains. In medical scenarios, this is particularly challenging as
accessing or storing past data is commonly not allowed due to data privacy. To
this end, we propose a novel domain-incremental learning framework to recover
past domain inputs first and then regularly replay them during model
optimization. Particularly, we first present a style-oriented replay module to
enable structure-realistic and memory-efficient reproduction of past data, and
then incorporate the replayed past data to jointly optimize the model with
current data to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. During optimization, we
additionally perform domain-sensitive feature whitening to suppress model's
dependency on features that are sensitive to domain changes (e.g.,
domain-distinctive style features) to assist domain-invariant feature
exploration and gradually improve the generalization performance of the
network. We have extensively evaluated our approach with the M&Ms Dataset in
single-domain and compound-domain incremental learning settings with improved

experimentally. Simulations are performed using the continuous 3D granular
model introduced in Daviet & Bertails-Descoubes (2016), which represents the
granular medium as an inelastic and dilatable continuum subject to the
Drucker-Prager yield criterion in the dense regime. One notable feature of this
numerical model is to resolve such a non-smooth rheology without any
regularisation.
  We show that this non-smooth model, which relies on a constant friction
coefficient, is able to reproduce with high fidelity various experimental
granular collapses over inclined erodible beds, provided the friction
coefficient is set to the avalanche angle - and not to the stop angle, as
generally done.
  To better characterise the range of validity of the fully plastic rheology in
transient frictional flows, we further revisit established scaling laws
regarding the shape of the final collapse deposit, and accurately recover the
expected power-law dependences.
  The influence of side wall friction is then investigated using experimental
and simulated collapses with a varying channel width. The analysis provides a
comprehensive framework to estimate the effective flow thickness in relation to
the channel width and initial pile height and invalidates assumptions on the
effective flow thickness formerly made in the literature.
  Finally, we extend the constant coefficient model with a hysteretic model,
thereby improving the predictions of the early-stage dynamics of the collapse.
This illustrates the potential effects of such phenomenology on transient
flows, paving the way to more elaborate analysis.

utilise a large number of auxiliary transformation-predicting tasks between

of 19 volunteers in a volunteer study, the hold-out test performance is
quantified by frame prediction accuracy, volume reconstruction overlap,
accumulated tracking error and final drift, based on ground-truth from an
optical tracker. The results show the importance of modelling the
temporal-spatially correlated input frames as well as output transformations,
with further improvement owing to additional past and/or future frames. The
best performing model was associated with predicting transformation between
moderately-spaced frames, with an interval of less than ten frames at 20 frames
per second (fps). Little benefit was observed by adding frames more than one
second away from the predicted transformation, with or without LSTM-based RNNs.
Interestingly, with the proposed approach, explicit within-sequence loss that
encourages consistency in composing transformations or minimises accumulated
error may no longer be required. The implementation code and volunteer data

fourth moments are approximated as behaving as if the velocities were Normally
distributed. Except for particles with weak inertia, the QNA leads to large
quantitative errors, and is not consistent with the known asymptotic
predictions of Sikovsky (Flow Turbulence Combust, vol. 92, 2014, pp. 41-64) for
the moments of the PDF in the viscous sublayer. We derive a new closure
approximation based on an asymptotic solution to the transport equations in
regions where the effect of particle inertia is significant. The new closure is
consistent with the asymptotic predictions of Sikovsky, but applies even
outside the viscous sublayer. Comparisons with direct numerical simulations
(DNS) show that the new closure gives similar results to the QNA (with the QNA
results in slightly better agreement with the DNS) when the viscous Stokes
number is $St<10$, but for $St>10$ the new model is in far better agreement
with the DNS than the QNA. While the predictions from the new model leave room
for improvement, the results suggest that this new closure strategy is a very
effective alternative to the traditional QNA approach, and the closure could be
refined in future work.

described by an attractive interaction that bounds electrons into Cooper pairs.
To date, the highest critical temperature at ambient conditions is achieved in
copper oxides. While layered nickel oxides were long proposed to be analogous
to cuprates, superconductivity was only demonstrated in 2019 albeit without
clarifying the pairing mechanism. Here we use Density Functional Theory (DFT)
to show that superconductivity in nickelates is driven by an electron-phonon
coupling originating from a charge ordering. Due to an intrinsic electronic
instability in half-doped compounds, Ni1.5+ cations dismutate into more stable
Ni+ and Ni2+ cations, which is accompanied by a bond disproportionation of NiO4
complexes producing an insulating charge ordered state. Once doping suppresses
the instability, the bond disproportionation vibration is sufficient to
reproduce the key characteristic of nickelates observed experimentally, notably
the dome of Tc as a function of doping content. These phenomena are identified
if relevant degrees of freedom as well as an exchange correlation functional
that sufficiently amends self-interaction errors are involved in the
simulations. Finally, despite the presence of correlation effects inherent to
3d elements, nickelates superconductors appear similar to non-magnetic bismuth
oxide superconductors.

only two nontrivial classes in the theory of $u$-representable graphs:
11-representable graphs, which correspond to word-representable graphs, and
12-representable graphs. This study deals with 12-representable graphs.
  Jones et al. (2015) provided a characterization of 12-representable trees in
terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. Chen and Kitaev (2022) presented a
forbidden induced subgraph characterization of a subclass of 12-representable

  This paper shows that a bipartite graph is 12-representable if and only if it
is an interval containment bigraph. The equivalence gives us a forbidden
induced subgraph characterization of 12-representable bipartite graphs since
the list of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs is known for interval
containment bigraphs. We then have a forbidden induced subgraph
characterization for grid graphs, which solves an open problem of Chen and
Kitaev (2022). The study also shows that a graph is 12-representable if and
only if it is the complement of a simple-triangle graph. This equivalence
indicates that a necessary condition for 12-representability presented by Jones

12-representability can be determined in $O(n^2)$ time for bipartite graphs and
in $O(n(\bar{m}+n))$ time for arbitrary graphs, where $n$ and $\bar{m}$ are the

induces a specific norm, which helps to quantify the manifold curvature and
determine the corresponding proper subset in the manifold tangent space. The
complexity of tangent space subset is then bridged to the complexity of

zero dipole moment but a finite quadrupole momentum that rapidly increases with
growing magnetic charge. For large charges, the monopole configurations are
strongly squashed and show inside a bubble of symmetric phase filled with a
U(1) hypercharge field produced by a pointlike magnetic charge at the origin,
strong enough to suppress all other fields and restore the full gauge symmetry.
The bubble is surrounded by a large belt of broken phase containing a
magnetically charged ring filled with a nonlinear W-condensate, squeezed
between two superconducting rings of opposite electric currents. In the far
field region there remains only the magnetic field supported by the total
magnetic charge contained at the origin and in the magnetic ring. The axially

treatment receipt and, through treatment receipt, on the outcome (a ""trial

business process, interventions that, if followed, prevent a negative outcome
of the process. Such interventions have to be reliable, that is, they have to
guarantee the achievement of the desired outcome or performance, and they have
to be flexible, that is, they have to avoid overturning the normal process
execution or forcing the execution of a given activity. Most of the existing
Prescriptive Process Monitoring solutions, however, while performing well in
terms of recommendation reliability, provide the users with very specific
(sequences of) activities that have to be executed without caring about the
feasibility of these recommendations. In order to face this issue, we propose a
new Outcome-Oriented Prescriptive Process Monitoring system recommending
temporal relations between activities that have to be guaranteed during the
process execution in order to achieve a desired outcome. This softens the
mandatory execution of an activity at a given point in time, thus leaving more
freedom to the user in deciding the interventions to put in place. Our approach
defines these temporal relations with Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
patterns that are used as features to describe the historical process data
recorded in an event log by the information systems supporting the execution of
the process. Such encoded log is used to train a Machine Learning classifier to
learn a mapping between the temporal patterns and the outcome of a process
execution. The classifier is then queried at runtime to return as
recommendations the most salient temporal patterns to be satisfied to maximize
the likelihood of a certain outcome for an input ongoing process execution. The
proposed system is assessed using a pool of 22 real-life event logs that have
already been used as a benchmark in the Process Mining community.

over other biometric modalities such as fingerprint, in that it is larger in
area, richer in information and able to work at a distance. However, the issue
of palmprint privacy and security (especially palmprint template protection)
remains under-studied. Among the very few research works, most of them only use
the directional and orientation features of the palmprint with transformation
processing, yielding unsatisfactory protection and identification performance.
Thus, this paper proposes a palmprint template protection-oriented operator
that has a fixed length and is ordered in nature, by fusing point features and
orientation features. Firstly, double orientations are extracted with more
accuracy based on MFRAT. Then key points of SURF are extracted and converted to
be fixed-length and ordered features. Finally, composite features that fuse up
the double orientations and SURF points are transformed using the irreversible
transformation of IOM to generate the revocable palmprint template. Experiments
show that the EER after irreversible transformation on the PolyU and CASIA

0.08% and 0.07%, respectively, which proves the advantage of our method.

$1$. More precisely, we prove our results for a large class of newforms $f$ and
prime numbers $p$ that are ordinary for $f$ and such that the weight of $f$ is
congruent to $2$ modulo $2(p-1)$. Inspired by work of W. Zhang in weight $2$,
the key ingredient in our strategy is an analogue for $p$-adic Galois
representations attached to higher (even) weight newforms of Kolyvagin's
conjecture on the $p$-indivisibility of derived Heegner points on elliptic
curves, which we prove via a $p$-adic variation method exploiting the
arithmetic of Hida families. Along the way, we also prove (under similar

rationality conjecture of Beilinson and Deligne on the existence of zeta
elements on the fundamental line in analytic ranks $0$ and $1$. Prior to this
work, the only known results on (questions related to) the $p$-TNC for modular

gravity, with some frozen degrees of freedom. We focus on the minisuperspace
reduction whith a finite number of degrees of freedom. Minisuperspaces are
treated as mechanical models, evolving in one spacetime direction. This
evolution parameter represents the orthogonal coordinate to the homogeneous
foliation of the spacetime. I investigate their classical symmetries and the
algebra of the corresponding Noether charges. After presenting the formalism
allowing us to describe the reduced models in terms of an action principle, we
discuss the condition for having an (extended) conformal symmetry. In
particular, the black hole model enlightens the subtle role of the spacelike
boundary of the homogeneous slice. The latter interplays with the conformal
symmetry, being associated with a conserved quantity from the mechanical point
of view. The absence of the infinite tower of charges, characteristic of the
full theory, is due here to a symmetry-breaking mechanism. This is made
explicit by looking at the infinite-dimensional extension of the symmetry
group. This allows to look at the equation of motion of the mechanical system
in terms of the infinite-dimensional group, who in turn has the effect of
rescaling the coupling constants of the theory. Finally, the presence of the
finite symmetry group allows defining a quantum model in terms of the
corresponding representation theory. At the level of the effective theory,
accounting for the quantum effects, the request that the symmetry is protected
provides a powerful tool to discriminate between different modifications. In
the end, the conformal invariance of the black hole background opens the door
to its holographic properties and might have important consequences in the
corresponding perturbation theory.

band gap that their charge carriers behave relativistically in one direction
and Schr\""odinger-like in the other. In the present work, we show that besides
the two well-known energy bands features (curvature and chirality), the
band-gap parameter also play a crucial role in the index- and magnetic
field-dependence of the Landau levels (LLs) in a GSD system. We take the
monolayer phosphorene as a GSD representative example to explicitly provide
physical insights into the role of this parameter in determining the index- and
magnetic field-dependence of LLs. We derive an effective one-dimensional
Schr\""odinger equation for charge carriers in the presence of a perpendicular
magnetic field and argue that the form of its effective potential is clearly
sensitive to a dimensionless band-gap that is tunable by structural parameters.
The theoretical magnitude of this effective gap and its interplay with oval
shape $k$-space cyclotron orbits resolve the seeming contradiction in
determining the type of the quantum Hall effect in the pristine monolayer
phosphorene. Our results strongly confirm that the dependence of LLs on the
magnetic field in this GSD material is as conventional two-dimensional
semiconductor electron gases up to a very high field regime. Using the
strain-induced gap modification scheme, we show the field dependence of the LLs
continuously evolves into $B^{2/3}$ behavior, which holds for a gapless
semi-Dirac system. The highlighted role of the band-gap parameter may affect
the consequences of the band anisotropy in the physical properties of a GSD
material, including magnetotransport, optical conductivity, dielectric
function, and thermoelectric performance.

electronics is studied using thousands of flat-field images from which we
derive stability, high resolution photon transfer curves and estimates of the
individual pixel gain. The sensor quantum efficiency is then measured relative
to a NIST-calibrated photodiode. Flat-field scans at 16 different wavelengths
are used to build maps of the sensor response. We demonstrate statistical
uncertainty on quantum efficiency below \SI{0.001}{e^-/\gamma} between
\SI{387}{nm} and \SI{950}{nm}. Systematic uncertainties in the bench optics are
controlled at the level of \SI{1e-3}{e^-/\gamma}. Uncertainty in the overall
normalization of the QE curve is 1\%. Regarding the camera we demonstrate
stability in steady state conditions at the level of \SI{32.5}{ppm}.
Homogeneity in the response is below \SI{1}{\percent} RMS across the entire
sensor area. Quantum efficiency stays above \SI{50}{\percent} in most of the
visible range, peaking well above \SI{80}{\percent} between \SI{440}{nm} and
\SI{570}{nm}. Differential non-linearities at the level of \SI{1}{\percent} are
detected. A simple 2-parameter model is proposed to mitigate the effect.

(GO) beamforming, tailored to acoustic broadband sources. Given, that
properties such as the source location, multipole rotation, or flow conditions
are parameterized over the frequency, a CSM-fitting can be performed for all
frequencies at once. A numerical analysis shows that the nonlinear energy
function for the standard GO problem is equivalent to the source's Point Spread
Function (PSF) and contains local minima at the grating- and side lobes'
locations. The energy function is improved with the proposed broadband energy,
as it averages the PSF. Further, it simplifies the process of identifying
sources and reconstructing their spectra from the results. The paper shows that
the method is superior on synthetic monopoles compared to standard GO and
CLEAN-SC. For real-world data the results of the proposed method and CLEAN-SC
are similar, and outperform standard GO. The main difference is that source
assumption violations cause noisy maps for CLEAN-SC and cause wrong spectral
estimations of the proposed method. By using reasonable initial values, the GO
problem reduces to a Local Optimization problem with similar results. Further,
the proposed method is able to identify synthetic multipoles with different
pole amplitudes and unknown pole rotations.

$\rho$ can be decomposed into a probability distribution on the subsets of $E$
such that the resulting random set intersects each $P \in \mathcal{P}$ with
probability at least $\pi_P$.
  Extending a result by Dahan, Amin, and Jaillet (MOR 2022) motivated by a
network security game in directed acyclic graphs, we show that such a
distribution exists if $\mathcal{P}$ is an abstract network and the
requirements are of the form $\pi_P = 1 - \sum_{e \in P} \mu_e$ for some $\mu

distribution that can be computed efficiently. As a consequence, equilibria for
the security game studied by Dahan et al. can be efficiently computed even when
the underlying digraph contains cycles. As a subroutine of our algorithm, we
provide a combinatorial algorithm for computing shortest paths in abstract
networks, answering an open question by McCormick (SODA 1996). We further show
that a conservation law proposed by Dahan et al. for requirement functions in
partially ordered sets can be reduced to the setting of affine requirements

large size and significant photon to charge particle discrimination. Air shower
telescopes for gamma-ray astronomy consist of an array of detectors capable of
measuring the passage of particles through the array elements. To maximize
signal at energies of a TeV or so, the array needs to be built at high altitude
as the maximum number of shower particles is high in the atmosphere. These
detectors have included sparse arrays of shower counters, dense arrays of
scintillators or resistive plate counters (RPC), buried muon detectors in
concert with surface detectors, or many-interaction-deep Water Cherenkov

typically due to shower-to-shower fluctuations and the intrinsic sampling of
the detector. These telescopes though, operate continuously, despite weather,
moonlight, day or night, and without needing to be pointed to a specific target

associated instability is examined for fluids featuring different density and
viscosity laws. In particular, a supercritical fluid is considered in order to
shed light on the new unstable mode found by Ren et al. (2019) in such fluids.
All the fluids considered feature a minimum of kinematic viscosity at a given
temperature. Their inviscid stability in plane Couette flow, whose walls are
differentially heated, is numerically assessed. A simple analytical stability
model introduced by Rayleigh is generalised to stratified flows. It is based on
the assumption that the instability is driven by the existence, in the base
flow profile, of a localised layer containing an excess of $\Phi$, the
density-weighted vorticity. We show that this layer is associated with the
characteristic scales of the minimum of kinematic viscosity in the flow. This
model is able to reproduce the behaviour of long waves, thereby offering good
predictions of the stability diagram for all types of stratification. It also
provides further physical insights regarding the driving parameters of the
instability and stabilising effects. The mechanism of the instability is
finally interpreted in terms of shear and inertial baroclinic effects. The
existence of the instability in different fluids and flows (e.g. miscible
fluids) is finally discussed.

  Aims: We provide new and more accurate (to the $0.1$ mas level) estimations
of the relativistic corrections to be included in the BCRS model of the
orientation and rotation of Mars to avoid a misinterpretation of the data.
  Methods: There are two types of relativistic contributions in Mars rotation
and orientation: (i) those that directly impact the Euler angles and (ii) those
resulting from the time transformation between a local Mars reference frame and
BCRS. The former correspond essentially to the geodetic effect. We compute them
assuming that Mars evolves on a Keplerian orbit. As for the latter, we compute
the effect of the time transformation and compare the rotation angle
corrections obtained using realistic orbits as described by ephemerides.
  Results: The relativistic correction in longitude comes mainly from the
geodetic effect and results in the geodetic precession (6.754mas/yr) and the
geodetic annual nutation (0.565 mas amplitude). For the rotation angle, the
correction is dominated by the effect of the time transformation. The main
annual, semi-annual, and ter-annual terms have amplitudes of 166.954 mas, 7.783
mas, and 0.544mas, respectively. The amplitude of the annual term differs by
about 9 mas from the estimate usually considered by the community. We identify
new terms at the Mars-Jupiter and Mars-Saturn synodic periods (0.567 mas and
0.102 mas amplitude) that are relevant considering the current level of
uncertainty of the measurements, as well as a contribution to the rotation rate
(7.3088 mas/day). There is no significant correction that applies to the

Boolean functions, are widely used, in many distinct contexts like model
verification, machine learning. The most famous variant, called reduced ordered
binary decision diagram (ROBDD for short), can be viewed as the result of a
compaction procedure on the full decision tree. In this paper we aim at
computing the exact distribution of the Boolean functions in $k$~variables
according to the ROBDD size, where the ROBDD size is equal to the size of the
underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. Recall the number of Boolean
functions is equal to $2^{2^k}$, which is of double exponential growth; hence a
combinatorial explosion is to be expected. The maximal size of a ROBDD with $k$
variables is $M_k \sim 2^k / k$ and thus, the support of the ROBDD size
distribution is also of length $M_k$, making $M_k$ a natural complexity unit
for our problem. In this paper, we develop the first polynomial algorithm to
derive the distribution of the Boolean functions with respect to their ROBDD
sizes. The algorithm is essentially quartic in $M_k$ for the time complexity
and quadratic for the space complexity. The main obstacle is to take into
account dependencies inside the DAG structure, and we propose a new
combinatorial counting procedure reminiscent of the inclusion-exclusion
principle. As a by-product, we present an efficient polynomial unranking
algorithm for ROBDDs, which in turn yields a uniform random sampler over the
set of ROBDDs of a given size or of a given profile. This is a great
improvement to the uniform sampler over the set of all Boolean functions in $k$
variables. Indeed, due to the Shannon effect, the uniform distribution over
Boolean functions is heavily biased to extremely complex functions, with near
maximal ROBDD size, thus preventing to sample small ROBDDs

  Lipschitz domains","49pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Concerned with elliptic operator with stationary random coefficients of
integrable correlations and bounded Lipschitz domains, arising from stochastic
homogenization theory, this paper is mainly devoted to studying
Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates. As an application, we obtain the homogenization
error in the sense of oscillation and fluctuation, and these results are
optimal up to a quantity $O(\ln(1/\varepsilon))$, which is coming from the
quantified sublinearity of correctors in dimension two and less smoothness of
the boundary of the domain.
  The main scheme relies on (weighted) annealed Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates,
which was recently developed by Josien and Otto \cite{Josien-Otto22} via a
robust non-perturbative argument, independent of the quenched
Calder\'on-Zygmund estimate that originally developed by Armstrong and Daniel
\cite{Armstrong-Daniel16} and Gloria, Neukamm and Otto
\cite{Gloria-Neukamm-Otto20}.
  Enlightened by Duerinckx and Otto's job \cite{Duerinckx-Otto20}, the main
innovation of the present work is to apply Shen's real arguments (of weighted
version) to study elliptic systems with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary
conditions. We start from a qualitative description of homogenization theorem
in a local way (without using boundary correctors), and find a new form of
\emph{minimal radius}, which proved to be a suitable key to open quantitative
homogenization on the boundary value problems, if adopting
Gloria-Neukamm-Otto's strategy that originally inspired by Naddaf and Spencer's
pioneering work.

matching capabilities, which makes them a common choice for hybrid IR systems.
However, these models exhibit a performance bottleneck in the online query

  In this paper we investigate heterogeneous dual-encoder models, where the two
encoders are separate models that do not share parameters or initializations.
We empirically show that heterogeneous dual-encoders are susceptible to
collapsing representations, causing them to output constant trivial
representations when they are fine-tuned using a standard contrastive loss due
to a distribution mismatch. We propose DAFT, a simple two-stage fine-tuning
approach that aligns the two encoders in order to prevent them from collapsing.
We further demonstrate how DAFT can be used to train efficient heterogeneous

  Environment","Submitted to IEEE RA-L",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Designing safety-critical control for robotic manipulators is challenging,
especially in a cluttered environment. First, the actual trajectory of a
manipulator might deviate from the planned one due to the complex collision
environments and non-trivial dynamics, leading to collision; Second, the
feasible space for the manipulator is hard to obtain since the explicit
distance functions between collision meshes are unknown. By analyzing the
relationship between the safe set and the controlled invariant set, this paper
proposes a data-driven control barrier function (CBF) construction method,
which extracts CBF from distance samples. Specifically, the CBF guarantees the
controlled invariant property for considering the system dynamics. The
data-driven method samples the distance function and determines the safe set.
Then, the CBF is synthesized based on the safe set by a scenario-based sum of
square (SOS) program. Unlike most existing linearization based approaches, our
method reserves the volume of the feasible space for planning without
approximation, which helps find a solution in a cluttered environment. The
control law is obtained by solving a CBF-based quadratic program in real time,
which works as a safe filter for the desired planning-based controller.
Moreover, our method guarantees safety with the proven probabilistic result.
Our method is validated on a 7-DOF manipulator in both real and virtual
cluttered environments. The experiments show that the manipulator is able to
execute tasks where the clearance between obstacles is in millimeters.

complex node embeddings that can be difficult to learn via standard

potential of adaptive readouts given by neural networks that do not necessarily
give rise to permutation invariant hypothesis spaces. We argue that in some
problems such as binding affinity prediction where molecules are typically

permutation invariance of the hypothesis space and learn a more effective model
of the affinity by employing an adaptive readout function. Our empirical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of neural readouts on more than 40

neural network (CNN) followed by recurrent neural network in an encoder-decoder
framework. In recent times, the transformer architecture is being widely
adopted in STR as it shows strong capability in capturing long-term dependency
which appears to be prominent in scene text images. Many researchers utilized
transformer as part of a hybrid CNN-transformer encoder, often followed by a
transformer decoder. However, such methods only make use of the long-term
dependency mid-way through the encoding process. Although the vision
transformer (ViT) is able to capture such dependency at an early stage, its
utilization remains largely unexploited in STR. This work proposes the use of a
transformer-only model as a simple baseline which outperforms hybrid
CNN-transformer models. Furthermore, two key areas for improvement were
identified. Firstly, the first decoded character has the lowest prediction
accuracy. Secondly, images of different original aspect ratios react
differently to the patch resolutions while ViT only employ one fixed patch
resolution. To explore these areas, Pure Transformer with Integrated Experts
(PTIE) is proposed. PTIE is a transformer model that can process multiple patch
resolutions and decode in both the original and reverse character orders. It is
examined on 7 commonly used benchmarks and compared with over 20

sparked our interest in the behaviour of chromospheric activity during this

series of TIGRE and Mount Wilson values, and we compare this long time series
with photometric data from the AAVSO database. In addition, we determine the
absolute and normalised excess flux of the Ca II H&K lines. To do so, we
estimate the changing effective temperature from TIGRE spectra and find a clear
drop of about 80 K between November 2019 and February 2020, which coincides
with the minimum of visual brightness. During the same period, the S-index
increased significantly, yet this is a mere contrast effect, because the
normalised excess flux of the Ca II H&K lines did not change significantly.
However, the latter dropped immediately after this episode. Comparing the
combined S_MWO values and visual magnitude time series, we find a similar
increase in the S-index during another noticeable decrease in the visual
magnitude of alpha Ori, which took place in 1984 and 1985. To also probe the
dynamics of the upper photosphere, we analysed the lines in 6251-6263 A and
found core distance varies which shows a relation with the great dimming event.
This type of variation could be caused by rising and sinking cool plumes as a
temporary spill-over of convection on alpha Ori. Based on our study, we
conclude that the cause for the great dimming is located in the photosphere.
Furthermore, the long-term spectroscopic and photometric time series suggests
that this great dimming does not appear to be a unique phenomenon, but rather
that such dimmings do occur more frequently, which motivates further monitoring
of alpha Ori with facilities such as TIGRE.

the need for fast and precise protocols for implementing quantum operations.
Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are a powerful tool for achieving these goals,
as they enable us to perform an exactly adiabatic evolution in finite time. In
this paper we present a shortcut to adiabaticity for the control of an
optomechanical cavity with two moving mirrors. Given reference trajectories for
the mirrors, we find analytical expressions that give us effective trajectories
which implement a STA for the quantum field inside the cavity. We then solve
these equations numerically for different reference protocols, such as
expansions, contractions and rigid motions; thus confirming the successful
implementation of the STA and finding some general features of these effective
trajectories.

in the (001) film of Mn${_3}$Pt, a noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin source
with face-centered cubic structure. Such spin current anisotropy originates
from the intertwined time reversal-odd ($T$-odd) and time reversal-even

characterizations of the current-induced spin torques in Mn${_3}$Pt-based
heterostructures, we find that the spin current generated by Mn${_3}$Pt (001)
exhibits exotic dependences on the current direction for all the spin

demonstrate that such an anisotropic spin current can be used to realize
low-power spintronic applications such as the efficient field-free switching of
the perpendicular magnetizations.

community: online RL and offline RL. In the online RL setting, the agent has no

an $\epsilon$-optimal policy. In the offline RL setting, the learner instead
has access to a fixed dataset to learn from, but is unable to otherwise
interact with the environment, and must obtain the best policy it can from this
offline data. Practical scenarios often motivate an intermediate setting: if we
have some set of offline data and, in addition, may also interact with the

online interactions necessary to learn an $\epsilon$-optimal policy?
  In this work, we consider this setting, which we call the \textsf{FineTuneRL}

of online samples needed in this setting given access to some offline dataset,

hexahedral elements are a good choice thanks to their superior numerical

take on a shape which prevents accurate computations. Such elements are

miniaturized, high-resolution Hyperspectral Imager (HSI), a 5MP RGB camera, and
a Software Defined Radio (SDR). The sensor generated data will be processed and
aggregated for end-users in a new web-based Data Analysis Center (DAC). The HSI
has 150 spectrally contiguous bands covering visible to near-infrared with 10
nm bandwidth. The HSI collects ocean color data to support studies of
oceanographic characteristics known to influence the spatio-temporal
distribution and movement behavior of marine organisms. Usage of an SDR expands
AEROS's operational and communication range and allows for remote
reconfiguration. The SDR receives, demodulates, and retransmits short duration
messages, from sources including tagged marine organisms, autonomous vehicles,
subsurface floats, and buoys. The future DAC will collect, store, process, and
analyze acquired data, taking advantage of its ability to disseminate data
across the stakeholders and the scientific network. Correlation of animal-borne
Argos platform locations and oceanographic data will advance fisheries
management, ecosystem-based management, monitoring of marine protected areas,
and bio-oceanographic research in the face of a rapidly changing environment.
For example, correlation of oceanographic data collected by the HSI, geolocated
with supplementary images from the RGB camera and fish locations, will provide
researchers with near real-time estimates of essential oceanographic variables
within areas selected by species of interest.

function. Experimental methods, namely Hi-C, reveal the spatial conformation
but output a 2D matrix representation. Biologists leverage simulation to bring
this information back to 3D, assembling a 3D chromatin shape prediction using
the 2D matrices as constraints. Our overview of existing chromatin
visualization software shows that the available tools limit the utility of 3D
through ineffective shading and a lack of advanced interactions. We designed
ChromoSkein to encourage analytical work directly with the 3D representation.
Our tool features a 3D view that supports understanding the shape of the highly
tangled chromatin fiber and the spatial relationships of its parts. Users can
explore and filter the 3D model using two interactions. First, they can manage
occlusion both by toggling the visibility of semantic parts and by adding
cutting planes. Second, they can segment the model through the creation of
custom selections. To complement the 3D view, we link the spatial
representation with non-spatial genomic data, such as 2D Hi-C maps and 1D
genomic signals. We demonstrate the utility of ChromoSkein in two exemplary use
cases that examine functional genomic loci in the spatial context of

distinct advantages as a hybrid quantum-classical approach to quantum machine

Kernel methods rely on the notion of similarity between points in a higher

of similarity assumes that points close in the feature space should be close in
the machine learning task space. In this paper, we discuss the use of
variational quantum kernels with task-specific quantum metric learning to
generate optimal quantum embeddings (a.k.a. quantum feature encodings) that are
specific to machine learning tasks. Such task-specific optimal quantum
embeddings, implicitly supporting feature selection, are valuable not only to
quantum kernel methods in improving the latter's performance, but they can also
be valuable to non-kernel QML methods based on parameterized quantum circuits

demonstrates the quantum utility, and quantum advantage (with

time, we show that the usefulness of the rounding error comes from its
covariance with the embedding changes. Unfortunately, this covariance between
continuous and discrete variables is not analytically available. An estimate of
the covariance is proposed, which allows to model steganography as a change in
the variance of DCT coefficients. Since steganalysis today is best performed in
the spatial domain, we derive a likelihood ratio test to preserve a model of a
decompressed JPEG image. The proposed method then bounds the power of this test
by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the cover and stego
distributions. We experimentally demonstrate in two popular datasets that it
achieves state-of-the-art performance against deep learning detectors.
Moreover, by considering a different pixel variance estimator for images
compressed with Quality Factor 100, even greater improvements are obtained.

write language-agnostic analyses. However, they suffer from several
shortcomings. They work mostly on source code and exclude the analysis of

Furthermore, they are limited in their analysis to whether an individual

where a decision maker is provided a context (a random set of actions drawn
from a distribution). The expected reward of each action is specified by the
inner product of the action and an unknown parameter. The goal is to design an
algorithm that learns to play as close as possible to the unknown optimal
policy after a number of action plays. This problem is considered more
challenging than the linear bandit problem, which can be viewed as a contextual
bandit problem with a \emph{fixed} context. Surprisingly, in this paper, we
show that the stochastic contextual problem can be solved as if it is a linear
bandit problem. In particular, we establish a novel reduction framework that
converts every stochastic contextual linear bandit instance to a linear bandit
instance, when the context distribution is known. When the context distribution
is unknown, we establish an algorithm that reduces the stochastic contextual
instance to a sequence of linear bandit instances with small misspecifications
and achieves nearly the same worst-case regret bound as the algorithm that
solves the misspecified linear bandit instances.
  As a consequence, our results imply a $O(d\sqrt{T\log T})$ high-probability
regret bound for contextual linear bandits, making progress in resolving an
open problem in (Li et al., 2019), (Li et al., 2021).
  Our reduction framework opens up a new way to approach stochastic contextual
linear bandit problems, and enables improved regret bounds in a number of
instances including the batch setting, contextual bandits with
misspecifications, contextual bandits with sparse unknown parameters, and
contextual bandits with adversarial corruption.

and edges of $\tilde{A}$ indicate the identical or different amounts of walks
of any sort in any length between vertices in $A$. Three processes are then
developed to obtain description graphs. They reveal relations among matrix
power, spectral decomposition and adjoint matrices, which is of independent
interest. 2. We show that the stabilization of description graphs can be
implemented via matrix-power stabilization, a new approach to distinguish
vertices and edges to graphs. The approach is proven to be equivalent in the

  This work presents techniques that allow the treatment of cut background

others, quadratic gravity admits vacua with non-constant scalar curvature. In a
recent publication [Phys. Rev. D 106, 104004 (2022)], we revitalized a program
that Buchdahl originated but prematurely abandoned circa 1962 [Nuovo Cimento
23, 141 (1962)], and uncovered a novel exhaustive class of static spherically
symmetric vacua for pure $R^2$ gravity. The Buchdahl-inspired metrics we
obtained therein are exact solutions which exhibit non-constant scalar
curvature. A product of fourth-order gravity, the metrics entail a new
(Buchdahl) parameter $k$ which allows the Ricci scalar to vary on the manifold.
The metrics are able to defeat the generalized Lichnerowicz theorem by evading
an overly strong restriction on the asymptotic falloff in the Ricci scalar as
assumed in the theorem. The Buchdahl parameter $k$ is a new characteristic of
pure $R^2$ gravity, a higher-derivative theory. By venturing that the Buchdahl
parameter should be a universal hallmark of higher-derivative gravity at large,
in this paper we seek to extend the concept to the quadratic action
$R^2+\gamma\,(R-2\Lambda)$. We are able to determine that the quadratic field
equation admits a perturbative vacuo that is valid up to the order $O(k^2)$.
Conforming with our guiding intuition, the Ricci scalar is non-constant,
including the asymptotically flat case, as long as $k\neq0$ and $\gamma\neq0$.
The existence of such an asymptotically flat vacuo with non-constant scalar
curvature defeats the generalized Lichnerowicz theorem in its entirety. Our
finding thus warrants restoring the $R^2$ term in the full quadratic action,
$\gamma\,R+\beta\,R^2-\alpha\,C^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, when

understand their universal low-temperature properties. One well studied feature
is the excess low-frequency density of states over the Debye model prediction.
Here we examine the system size dependence of the density of states for
two-dimensional glasses. For systems of fewer than 100 particles, the density
of states scales with the system size as if all the modes were plane-wave-like.
However, for systems greater than 100 particles we find a different system-size
scaling of the cumulative density of states below the first transverse sound
mode frequency, which can be derived from the assumption that these modes are
quasi-localized. Moreover, for systems greater than 100 particles, we find that
the cumulative density of states scales with frequency as a power law with the
exponent that leads to the exponent $\beta=3.5$ for the density of states
independent of system size.

manifold induce homogeneous linear transformations on its tangent spaces. We
see that a pseudo-orthonormal frame in a given tangent space is the basis for a
set of Riemann normal coordinates. A Lorentz subgroup of the general linear
transformations preserves this pseudo-orthonormality. We borrow techniques from
the methodology of non-linear realizations to analyze this group-subgroup
structure.
  `Parallel maps' are used to relate tangent space at different points.
`Parallelisms' across a finite region of the manifold may be built up from
them. These are used to define Weitzenb\""{o}ck connections and Levi-Civita
connections.
  This provides a new formulation of teleparallel gravity, in which the tetrad
field is viewed as a field-valued group element relating the coordinate basis
to the frame basis used in defining a parallelism. This formulation separates
the metric degrees of freedom from those associated with the choice of
parallelism. The group element can be combined by matrix multiplication with
Lorentz transformations of frame or with other Jacobian matrices. We show how
this facilitates a new understanding of inertial forces and local Lorentz
transformations.
  The analysis is also applied to translations of the coordinates. If they are
constant across spacetime, this has no effect on the tangent space bases. If
the translation parameters become fields, they induce general linear
transformations of the coordinate basis; however, the tetrad components can
only be expressed in terms of translations on a flat spacetime.

behavioural shifts in real-time, comprising a tool that helps clinicians
supervise patients' evolution over time and enhance the associated treatments'
outcomes. Frequently, sleep disturbances and mental health deterioration are
closely related, as mental health condition worsening regularly entails shifts
in the patients' circadian rhythms. Therefore, Sleep Activity Recognition
constitutes a behavioural marker to portray patients' activity cycles and to
detect behavioural changes among them. Moreover, mobile passively sensed data
captured from smartphones, thanks to these devices' ubiquity, constitute an
excellent alternative to profile patients' biorhythm.
  In this work, we aim to identify major sleep episodes based on passively
sensed data. To do so, a Heterogeneous Hidden Markov Model is proposed to model
a discrete latent variable process associated with the Sleep Activity
Recognition task in a self-supervised way. We validate our results against
sleep metrics reported by clinically tested wearables, proving the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  2000 to 2019","23 pages, 10 figures",,,,"stat.AP econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  An information entropy statistical methodology was used to evaluate the
growth of the UK economy over the period 2000 to 2019, with an emphasis on the
impact of labour productivity on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and
the average growth in real wages, during this time period. The growth of the UK
economy over the period 2000 to 2019 can be described in terms of three
distinct phases: 1) 2000 to 2007 - strong sustained economic growth 2) 2008 to
2013 - the impact of the international financial crisis, its immediate
aftermath, and period of recovery 3) 2014 to 2019 - weak sustained economic
growth The key determinant of the UK economic performance over this period
would appear to the annual rate of growth in labour productivity. It was
closely related to the annual rate of growth in GDP per capita, and it was
significantly weaker in the period 2014 to 2019 compared to the period 2000 to
2007. This also corresponded with a weaker rate of growth in annual average
real wages over the period 2014 to 2019 compared to the period 2000 to 2007.
Throughout the period 2000 to 2019, UK CPI was maintained, on average, at
approximately 2.1% per annum. More rapid UK economic growth would be expected
to be achieved by sustained investment in measures that enhance labour
productivity, with the further expectation that a sustained improvement in
labour productivity would increase the annual rate of growth of UK GDP per
capita and average real wages. While the results given in this paper are
specific to the UK over the time period 2000 to 2019, the expectation is that
the methodology and approach adopted can be applied to quantifying the dynamics
of any developed economy over any time period.

when compared with DRAM. Its main drawback is that it is slower than DRAM. On
the other hand, DRAM has scalability problems due to its cost and energy
consumption. NVM will likely coexist with DRAM in computer systems and the
biggest challenge is to know which data to allocate on each type of memory. A
state-of-the-art approach is AutoNUMA, in the Linux kernel. Prior work is
limited to measuring AutoNUMA solely in terms of the application execution
time, without understanding AutoNUMA's behavior. In this work we provide a more
in-depth characterization of AutoNUMA, for instance, identifying where exactly
a set of pages are allocated, while keeping track of promotion and demotion
decisions performed by AutoNUMA. Our analysis shows that AutoNUMA's benefits
can be modest when running graph processing applications, or graph analytics,
because most pages have only one access over the entire execution time and
other pages accesses have no temporal locality. We make a case for exploring
application characteristics using object-level mappings between DRAM and NVM.
Our preliminary experiments show that an object-level memory tiering can better
capture the application behavior and reduce the execution time of graph
analytics by 21% (avg) and 51% (max), when compared to AutoNUMA, while
significantly reducing the number of memory accesses in NVM.
