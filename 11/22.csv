  Human Feedback",,,,,"cs.LG cs.HC cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  An important goal in artificial intelligence is to create agents that can
both interact naturally with humans and learn from their feedback. Here we
demonstrate how to use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve upon simulated, embodied agents trained to a base level of competency
with imitation learning. First, we collected data of humans interacting with
agents in a simulated 3D world. We then asked annotators to record moments
where they believed that agents either progressed toward or regressed from
their human-instructed goal. Using this annotation data we leveraged a novel
method - which we call ""Inter-temporal Bradley-Terry"" (IBT) modelling - to
build a reward model that captures human judgments. Agents trained to optimise
rewards delivered from IBT reward models improved with respect to all of our
metrics, including subsequent human judgment during live interactions with
agents. Altogether our results demonstrate how one can successfully leverage
human judgments to improve agent behaviour, allowing us to use reinforcement
learning in complex, embodied domains without programmatic reward functions.

  Learning","Offline RL Workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many real-world applications, collecting large and high-quality datasets
may be too costly or impractical. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to
infer an optimal decision-making policy from a fixed set of data. Getting the
most information from historical data is then vital for good performance once
the policy is deployed. We propose a model-based data augmentation strategy,
Trajectory Stitching (TS), to improve the quality of sub-optimal historical
trajectories. TS introduces unseen actions joining previously disconnected
states: using a probabilistic notion of state reachability, it effectively
`stitches' together parts of the historical demonstrations to generate new,
higher quality ones. A stitching event consists of a transition between a pair
of observed states through a synthetic and highly probable action. New actions
are introduced only when they are expected to be beneficial, according to an
estimated state-value function. We show that using this data augmentation
strategy jointly with behavioural cloning (BC) leads to improvements over the
behaviour-cloned policy from the original dataset. Improving over the BC policy
could then be used as a launchpad for online RL through planning and
demonstration-guided RL.

Magneto-optic isolators have excellent operating characteristics, including

The technique of temporal modulation of dielectric constant offers an

its own drawbacks. In this work I examine diverse methods of optical isolation
via temporal modulation and show that independent on whether modulation is
achieved by carrier injection, Pockels and acousto-optic effects, or any other
conceivable method, there is essentially the same set of constraints on

different macrofouling classes. The establishment of macrofouling localization
allows for the generation of a successional model which enables the

remotely operating anomaly detectors in a privacy-preserving manner. We
consider the following problem setup. A remote station seeks to identify
anomalies based on system input-output signals transmitted over communication
networks. However, it is not desired to disclose true data of the system
operation as it can be used to infer private information. To prevent
adversaries from eavesdropping on the network or at the remote station itself
to access private data, we propose a privacy-preserving coding scheme to
distort signals before transmission. As a next step, we design a new anomaly
detector that runs on distorted signals and produces distorted diagnostics
signals, and a decoding scheme that allows extracting true diagnostics data
from distorted signals without error. The proposed scheme is built on the
synergy of matrix encryption and system Immersion and Invariance (I&I) tools
from control theory. The idea is to immerse the anomaly detector into a
higher-dimensional system (the so-called target system). The dynamics of the
target system is designed such that: the trajectories of the original anomaly
detector are immersed/embedded in its trajectories, it works on randomly
encoded input-output signals, and produces an encoded version of the original
anomaly detector alarm signals, which are decoded to extract the original alarm
at the user side. We show that the proposed privacy-preserving scheme provides
the same anomaly detection performance as standard Kalman filter-based
chi-squared anomaly detectors while revealing no information about system data.

to do as little of it as possible. To make the most of a given ""annotation
budget"" we can turn to active learning (AL) which aims to identify the most
informative samples in a dataset for annotation. Active learning algorithms are
typically uncertainty-based or diversity-based. Both have seen success in image
classification, but fall short when it comes to object detection. We
hypothesise that this is because: (1) it is difficult to quantify uncertainty
for object detection as it consists of both localisation and classification,
where some classes are harder to localise, and others are harder to classify;
(2) it is difficult to measure similarities for diversity-based AL when images
contain different numbers of objects. We propose a two-stage active learning
algorithm Plug and Play Active Learning (PPAL) that overcomes these
difficulties. It consists of (1) Difficulty Calibrated Uncertainty Sampling, in
which we used a category-wise difficulty coefficient that takes both
classification and localisation into account to re-weight object uncertainties
for uncertainty-based sampling; (2) Category Conditioned Matching Similarity to
compute the similarities of multi-instance images as ensembles of their
instance similarities. PPAL is highly generalisable because it makes no change

weight function is proportional to the target density. We show both

be think of as MTM algorithms which sample an infinite number of candidates at

algorithms which sample a finite number of candidates. Our analysis unveils a
strong distinction between the convergence and stationary phases: in the
former, local balancing is crucial and effective to achieve fast convergence,

a novel perspective focusing on the transition of the target recovery/fitting
accuracy as a function of the training data size. We propose a rank
stratification for general nonlinear models to uncover a model rank as an
""effective size of parameters"" for each function in the function space of the

that a target function almost surely becomes linearly stable when the training
data size equals its model rank. Supported by our experiments, we propose a
linear stability hypothesis that linearly stable functions are preferred by
nonlinear training. By these results, model rank of a target function predicts
a minimal training data size for its successful recovery. Specifically for the
matrix factorization model and DNNs of fully-connected or convolutional

target functions can be much lower than the size of model parameters. This
result predicts the target recovery capability even at heavy
overparameterization for these nonlinear models as demonstrated quantitatively
by our experiments. Overall, our work provides a unified framework with
quantitative prediction power to understand the mysterious target recovery
behavior at overparameterization for general nonlinear models.

between two Gaussian process models, such as those widely used in computer

design or from the beginning of observation. The selection relies on the
maximisation of the difference between the symmetric Kullback Leibler
divergences for the two models, which depends on the observations, or on the
mean squared error of both models, which does not. Then, we consider static
criteria, such as the familiar log-likelihood ratios and the Fr\'echet distance
between the covariance functions of the two models. Other distance-based
criteria, simpler to compute than previous ones, are also introduced, for
which, considering the framework of approximate design, a necessary condition

""loose clusters"" which do not power a collective wind termination shock. SNR
shocks then expand in a low-density and weakly magnetised medium, and this
population mainly contributes up to the ""knee"" of the CR spectrum around 1 PeV.
The second population are young compact clusters, which are powerful and
compact enough to sustain a collective wind outflow. SNR shocks then expand
from the cluster into the strongly magnetised wind and accelerate nuclei up to
ultra-high energies. This population, representing only about 15% of all
Galactic massive star clusters, nevertheless dominates the spectrum between ~ 1

spectrum up to hundreds of PeV, adding a light sub-ankle extragalactic
component motivated by composition and anisotropy measurements, allows to
reproduce the spectrum up to the highest energies. Fitting parameters are
systematically linked to physical variables whose values are in line with

approaches have ignored the online latency that can cause severe performance
degradation during real-world processing. Especially for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), where robust tracking is more challenging and onboard
computation is limited, the latency issue can be fatal. In this work, we
present a simple framework for end-to-end latency-aware tracking, i.e.,
end-to-end predictive visual tracking (PVT++). Unlike existing solutions that
naively append Kalman Filters after trackers, PVT++ can be jointly optimized,
so that it takes not only motion information but can also leverage the rich
visual knowledge in most pre-trained tracker models for robust prediction.
Besides, to bridge the training-evaluation domain gap, we propose a relative
motion factor, empowering PVT++ to generalize to the challenging and complex
UAV tracking scenes. These careful designs have made the small-capacity
lightweight PVT++ a widely effective solution. Additionally, this work presents
an extended latency-aware evaluation benchmark for assessing an any-speed
tracker in the online setting. Empirical results on a robotic platform from the
aerial perspective show that PVT++ can achieve significant performance gain on
various trackers and exhibit higher accuracy than prior solutions, largely
mitigating the degradation brought by latency. Our code will be made public.

interacting with the phonons of a material, whose lattice parameters are much
smaller than the polaron scale. The electron-phonon interaction also leads to
an attractive interaction between electrons, which can allow two polarons to
pair up and form a bipolaron. It has been shown that large bipolarons can form
in theory due to strong 1-electron-1-phonon coupling, but they have not been
seen in real materials because the critical value of the required
electron-phonon interaction is too large. Here, we investigate the effect of
1-electron-2-phonon coupling on the large bipolaron problem.
  Starting from a generalization of the Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian that includes
both the standard 1-electron-1-phonon interaction as well as an anharmonic
1-electron-2-phonon interaction, we use the path integral method to find a
semi-analytical upper bound for the bipolaron energy that is valid at all
values of the Fr\""ohlich coupling strength $\alpha$. We find the bipolaron
phase diagram and conditions for the bipolaron stability by comparing the
bipolaron energy to the energy of two free polarons. The critical value of the
Fr\""ohlich coupling strength $\alpha_{\text{crit}}$ is calculated as a function
of the strength of the 1-electron-2-phonon interaction. The results suggest
that large bipolaron formation is more likely in materials with significant
1-electron-2-phonon interaction as well as strong 1-electron-1-phonon
interaction, such as strontium titanate.

  Perspective","CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We revisit and advance visual prompting (VP), an input prompting technique
for vision tasks. VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to
accomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating
universal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream
data points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a
ruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes.
Inspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to
exploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer
into the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better
'quality' of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can
consistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior
art where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP
framework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting),
which automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and
progressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a
contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model, we propose to integrate an
LM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the
target task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VP methods. As highlighted below, we
show that when reprogramming an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 to 13 target
tasks, our method outperforms baselines by a substantial margin, e.g., 7.9% and
6.7% accuracy improvements in transfer learning to the target Flowers102 and

as it replaces the usual Poincar\'e algebra with a vanishing speed of light
version thereof. These symmetries have found universal applications in the
physics of null manifolds as they arise in diverse situations ranging from
black hole horizons to condensed matter systems with vanishing Fermi
velocities. In this work, we concentrate on fermions living on two dimensional
($2d$) null manifolds and explore the Carroll invariant structure of the
associated field theories in a systematic manner. The free massless versions of
these fermions are shown to exhibit $2d$ Conformal Carroll or equivalently the
$3d$ Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra as their symmetry. Due to the degenerate
nature of the manifold, we show the presence of two distinct classes of
Clifford Algebras. We also find that in two dimensions there are two distinct
fermion actions. We study discrete and continuous symmetries of both theories,
and quantize them using highest weight representation of the vacuum. We also
discuss how the symmetries of $2d$ free fermion CFTs can be continually
deformed by infinite boosts or degenerate linear transformations on
coordinates, leading to the corresponding BMS invariant theory at singular
points.

metrics on Carroll spacetimes, there is the possibility of two different
versions of Carroll Clifford algebras. We consider both possibilities and
construct explicit representations of Carrollian gamma matrices and show how to
build higher spacetime dimensional representations out of lower ones. Actions
for Carroll fermions are constructed with these gamma matrices and the
properties of these actions are investigated.
  We show that in condensed matter systems where the dispersion relation
becomes trivial i.e. the energy is not dependent on momentum and bands flatten
out, Carroll symmetry generically appears. We give explicit examples of this
including that of twisted bi-layer graphene, where superconductivity appears at
so called magic angles and connect this to Carroll fermions.

able to reflect or introspect, i.e., to shift from meta-reasoning to

SDEwMS are not available in the literature, perhaps because of the absence of
the It\^o-Taylor expansion. In this article, first, we overcome these
challenges and derive the It\^o-Taylor expansion for SDEwMS, under some
suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients, by developing new
techniques. Secondly, we demonstrate an application of our first result on the
It\^o-Taylor expansion in the numerical approximations of SDEwMS. We derive an

strong rate of convergence of our scheme is equal to
$\gamma\in\{n/2:n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ under some suitable Lipschitz-type conditions

designing and analysis of the It\^o-Taylor expansion and the

  This paper studies PIFO trees from a programming language perspective. We
formalize the syntax and semantics of PIFO trees in an operational model that
decouples the scheduling policy running on a tree from the topology of the
tree. Building on this formalization, we develop compilation algorithms that
allow the behavior of a PIFO tree written against one topology to be realized
using a tree with a different topology. Such a compiler could be used to
optimize an implementation of a PIFO trees, or realize a logical PIFO tree on a
target with a fixed topology baked into the hardware. To support

  Recommendation Systems",,,"10.1145/3485447.3512110",,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, user-oriented auto-encoders (UAEs) have been widely used in
recommender systems to learn semantic representations of users based on their
historical ratings. However, since latent item variables are not modeled in
UAE, it is difficult to utilize the widely available item content information
when ratings are sparse. In addition, whenever new items arrive, we need to
wait for collecting rating data for these items and retrain the UAE from
scratch, which is inefficient in practice. Aiming to address the above two
problems simultaneously, we propose a mutually-regularized dual collaborative
variational auto-encoder (MD-CVAE) for recommendation. First, by replacing
randomly initialized last layer weights of the vanilla UAE with stacked latent
item embeddings, MD-CVAE integrates two heterogeneous information sources,
i.e., item content and user ratings, into the same principled variational
framework where the weights of UAE are regularized by item content such that
convergence to a non-optima due to data sparsity can be avoided. In addition,
the regularization is mutual in that user ratings can also help the dual item
content module learn more recommendation-oriented item content embeddings.
Finally, we propose a symmetric inference strategy for MD-CVAE where the first
layer weights of the UAE encoder are tied to the latent item embeddings of the
UAE decoder. Through this strategy, no retraining is required to recommend
newly introduced items. Empirical studies show the effectiveness of MD-CVAE in
both normal and cold-start scenarios. Codes are available at

  Aims. We aim to investigate long-term, single-site observations of the

determine as many eigenmodes for asteroseismology as possible and then to carry
out a seismic analysis of this target.
  Methods. We performed a Fourier analysis of the light curves obtained in
different epochs. After finding the normal modes of the pulsation, we ran the
2018 version of the White Dwarf Evolution Code to build model grids for the
period fits. We compared the seismic distance of the best-fit model with the
geometric value provided by Gaia measurements.
  Results. We find that GD 99 is rich in pulsation modes in the 200-1100 s
period range, as we detected seven new periods. Together with the literature
data, we were able to use 11 modes for the asteroseismic fits. We accepted an

fit, however, this suggests a hotter and more massive star than we might have
expected based on the spectroscopic values. We also estimated the rotational

point clouds with natural images. Second, we leverage large-scale language
models to automatically design a more descriptive 3D-semantic prompt for CLIP's

any training in 3D domains, our approach significantly surpasses PointCLIP by

quark-meson model have been computed and compared in an extended mean-field
approximation (e-MFA) where the model parameters are fixed by using different
renormalization prescriptions after including quark one-loop vacuum
fluctuations. When the vacuum one-loop divergence is regularized in the minimal
subtraction scheme and the curvature masses of the scalar and pseudo-scalar
mesons are used for fixing the parameters, the setting of the quark-meson model
with the vacuum term (QMVT) turns out to be inconsistent as one notes that the
curvature masses are defined by the evaluation of self-energy at zero momentum.
This work constitutes the first application of the consistent on-shell
parameter fixing scheme to the three flavor quark-meson (QM) model. In this
setting of the renormalized quark-meson (RQM) model, the physical (pole) masses
of the $\pi, K, \eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ pseudo-scalar mesons and the scalar
$\sigma$ meson,the pion decay constant and kaon decay constant are put into the
relation of the running mass parameter and couplings by using the on-shell and
the minimal subtraction renormalization schemes. The nonstrange direction
normalized vacuum effective potential plots for both the RQM model and QMVT
model, are exactly identical for the $m_\sigma=$ 658.8 MeV while the nonstrange
direction order parameter temperature variations and phase diagrams for both
the models RQM and PQMVT are identical when the $m_\sigma $ value is smaller by
10 MeV i.e. $m_\sigma=$ 648 MeV. This happens because the normalized vacuum
effective potential variation in the nonstrange direction is somewhat
influenced by its variation in the strange direction.

computing, especially for echocardiography, where the anatomical structures are
relatively noisy compared to other imaging modalities. Traditional
(non-learning) registration approaches rely on the iterative optimization of a
similarity metric which is usually costly in time complexity. In recent years,
convolutional neural network (CNN) based image registration methods have shown
good effectiveness. In the meantime, recent studies show that the
attention-based model (e.g., Transformer) can bring superior performance in
pattern recognition tasks. In contrast, whether the superior performance of the
Transformer comes from the long-winded architecture or is attributed to the use
of patches for dividing the inputs is unclear yet. This work introduces three
patch-based frameworks for image registration using MLPs and transformers. We
provide experiments on 2D-echocardiography registration to answer the former
question partially and provide a benchmark solution. Our results on a large
public 2D echocardiography dataset show that the patch-based MLP/Transformer
model can be effectively used for unsupervised echocardiography registration.
They demonstrate comparable and even better registration performance than a
popular CNN registration model. In particular, patch-based models better
preserve volume changes in terms of Jacobian determinants, thus generating
robust registration fields with less unrealistic deformation. Our results
demonstrate that patch-based learning methods, whether with attention or not,
can perform high-performance unsupervised registration tasks with adequate time
and space complexity. Our codes are available

of simulating even a single halo. In this paper, we make use of a set of high
resolution, cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive M_star>10^10.5M_sol at
z=2), star-forming galaxies from the FIRE suite. We run the SKIRT radiative
transfer code on hundreds of snapshots in the redshift range 1.5<z<5 and
calibrate a power law scaling relation between dust mass, star formation rate
and 870um flux density. The derived scaling relation shows encouraging
consistency with observational results from the sub-millimeter-selected AS2UDS
sample. We extend this to other wavelengths, deriving scaling relations between
dust mass, stellar mass, star formation rate and redshift and sub-millimeter
flux density at observed-frame wavelengths between 340um and 870um. We then
apply the scaling relations to galaxies drawn from EAGLE, a large box

of a partial differential equation (PDE) by incorporating the residual of the
PDE along with its initial/boundary conditions into the loss function. In spite
of their partial success, PINNs are known to struggle even in simple cases
where the closed-form analytical solution is available. In order to better
understand the learning mechanism of PINNs, this work focuses on a systematic
analysis of PINNs for the linear advection-diffusion equation (LAD) using the
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Thanks to the NTK analysis, the effects of
the advection speed/diffusion parameter on the training dynamics of PINNs are
studied and clarified. We show that the training difficulty of PINNs is a
result of 1) the so-called spectral bias, which leads to difficulty in learning
high-frequency behaviours; and 2) convergence rate disparity between different
loss components that results in training failure. The latter occurs even in the
cases where the solution of the underlying PDE does not exhibit high-frequency
behaviour. Furthermore, we observe that this training difficulty manifests
itself, to some extent, differently in advection-dominated and
diffusion-dominated regimes. Different strategies to address these issues are
also discussed. In particular, it is demonstrated that periodic activation
functions can be used to partly resolve the spectral bias issue.

networks to domains that are not seen in the training time. Hence, we need to
understand the extrapolation of nonlinear models -- under what conditions on

to new test distributions. The question is very challenging because even
two-layer neural networks cannot be guaranteed to extrapolate outside the
support of the training distribution without further assumptions on the domain
shift. This paper makes some initial steps toward analyzing the extrapolation
of nonlinear models for structured domain shift. We primarily consider settings
where the marginal distribution of each coordinate of the data (or subset of
coordinates) does not shift significantly across the training and test
distributions, but the joint distribution may have a much bigger shift. We
prove that the family of nonlinear models of the form $f(x)=\sum f_i(x_i)$,
where $f_i$ is an arbitrary function on the subset of features $x_i$, can
extrapolate to unseen distributions, if the covariance of the features is
well-conditioned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that
goes beyond linear models and the bounded density ratio assumption, even though
the assumptions on the distribution shift and function class are stylized.

emerged as a data-efficient and parameter-efficient method for adapting large

existing approaches usually consider learning prompt vectors for each task
independently from scratch, thereby failing to exploit the rich shareable
knowledge across different vision-language tasks. In this paper, we propose
multitask vision-language prompt tuning (MVLPT), which incorporates cross-task
knowledge into prompt tuning for vision-language models. Specifically, (i) we
demonstrate the effectiveness of learning a single transferable prompt from
multiple source tasks to initialize the prompt for each target task; (ii) we
show many target tasks can benefit each other from sharing prompt vectors and
thus can be jointly learned via multitask prompt tuning. We benchmark the
proposed MVLPT using three representative prompt tuning methods, namely text
prompt tuning, visual prompt tuning, and the unified vision-language prompt
tuning. Results in 20 vision tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms all single-task baseline prompt tuning methods, setting the new
state-of-the-art on the few-shot ELEVATER benchmarks and cross-task
generalization benchmarks. To understand where the cross-task knowledge is most
effective, we also conduct a large-scale study on task transferability with 20
vision tasks in 400 combinations for each prompt tuning method. It shows that
the most performant MVLPT for each prompt tuning method prefers different task
combinations and many tasks can benefit each other, depending on their visual
similarity and label similarity. Code is available at

the well-known cut-matching game framework.
  Constant-hop expanders strengthen expanders with constant conductance by
guaranteeing that any demand can be (obliviously) routed along constant-hop
paths - in contrast to the $\Omega(\log n)$-hop routes in expanders.
  Cut-matching games for expanders are key tools for obtaining
close-to-linear-time approximation algorithms for many hard problems, including
finding (balanced or approximately-largest) sparse cuts, certifying the
expansion of a graph by embedding an (explicit) expander, as well as computing
expander decompositions, hierarchical cut decompositions, oblivious routings,
multi-cuts, and multicommodity flows. The cut-matching game provided in this
paper is crucial in extending this versatile and powerful machinery to
constant-hop expanders. It is also a key ingredient towards close-to-linear
time algorithms for computing a constant approximation of multicommodity-flows
and multi-cuts - the approximation factor being a constant relies on the
expanders being constant-hop.

Structured Vision&Language Concepts (SVLC) which includes object attributes,

Recent studies have shown that even the best VL models struggle with SVLC. A
possible way of fixing this issue is by collecting dedicated datasets for

Instead, we propose a more elegant data-driven approach for enhancing VL

understanding of image structure still remains largely unsolved, language
structure is much better modeled and understood, allowing for its effective
utilization in teaching VL models. In this paper, we propose various techniques
based on language structure understanding that can be used to manipulate the

ratio of the current noise to the average current in the DC limit. This system
is representative of metals in which electron correlations are extremely
strong. Here we carry out the first theoretical study on the shot noise of

this level of precision with just five free parameters beyond those describing
the baryonification model. At fixed cosmology, we find that galaxy-galaxy
lensing provides a general consistency test but little additional information
on galaxy modelling parameters beyond that encoded in the redshift-space
multipoles. It does, however, improve constraints if only the projected
correlation function is available, as in surveys with only photometric
redshifts. We expect SHAMe to have a higher fidelity across a wider range of
scales than more traditional methods such as Halo Occupation Distribution
modelling. Thus it should provide a significantly more powerful and more robust
tool for analysing next-generation large-scale surveys.

must explore to discover the goal, i.e., search efficiently using learned
priors. Once the goal is discovered, the agent must accurately calibrate the
last-mile of navigation to the goal. As with any robust system, switches
between exploratory goal discovery and exploitative last-mile navigation enable
better recovery from errors. Following these intuitive guide rails, we propose
SLING to improve the performance of existing image-goal navigation systems.
Entirely complementing prior methods, we focus on last-mile navigation and
leverage the underlying geometric structure of the problem with neural
descriptors. With simple but effective switches, we can easily connect SLING
with heuristic, reinforcement learning, and neural modular policies. On a
standardized image-goal navigation benchmark (Hahn et al. 2021), we improve
performance across policies, scenes, and episode complexity, raising the
state-of-the-art from 45% to 55% success rate. Beyond photorealistic
simulation, we conduct real-robot experiments in three physical scenes and find
these improvements to transfer well to real environments.

diversity of physical processes observed in a broad range of applications, the
underlying instabilities observed in practice have a universal characterization
which is determined by the overall gain and loss curves of a given system. The
universal behavior of damped-driven systems can be understood from a
geometrical description of the energy balance with a minimal number of
assumptions. The assumptions on the energy dynamics are as follows: the energy
increases monotonically as a function of increasing gain, and the losses become
increasingly larger with increasing energy, i.e. there are many routes for
dissipation in the system for large input energy. The intersection of the gain
and loss curves define an energy balanced solution. By constructing an
iterative map between the loss and gain curves, the dynamics can be shown to be
homeomorphic to the logistic map, which exhibits a period doubling cascade to
chaos. Indeed, the loss and gain curves allow for a geometrical description of
the dynamics through a simple Verhulst diagram (cobweb plot). Thus irrespective
of the physics and its complexities, this simple geometrical description
dictates the universal set of logistic map instabilities that arise in complex
damped-driven systems. More broadly, damped-driven systems are a class of
non-equilibrium pattern forming systems which have a canonical set of
instabilities that are manifest in practice.

Crucial ingredients that arise in such effective field theories are generalized
$\theta$-terms. These introduce non-linear couplings between axion fields and
topological terms quadratic in the gauge field strengths which break a large

further be broken by assuming the existence of some charged states. However, we
illustrate that the presence of generalized $\theta$-terms leads to a

responsible for reducing cooling flows in cool-core galaxy clusters. We use
simulations to model feedback from hydrodynamic jets in isolated halos. While
the jet propagation converges only after the diameter of the jet is well
resolved, reliable predictions about the effects these jets have on the cooling
time distribution function only require resolutions sufficient to keep the
jet-inflated cavities stable. Comparing different model variations, as well as
an independent jet model using a different hydrodynamics code, we show that the
dominant uncertainties are the choices of jet properties within a given model.
Independent of implementation, we find that light, thermal jets with low
momentum flux tend to delay the onset of a cooling flow more efficiently on a
$50$ Myr timescale than heavy, kinetic jets. The delay of the cooling flow
originates from a displacement and boost in entropy of the central gas. If the
jet kinetic luminosity depends on accretion rate, collimated, light,
hydrodynamic jets are able to reduce cooling flows in halos, without a need for
jet precession or wide opening angles. Comparing the jet feedback with a
`kinetic wind' implementation shows that equal amounts of star formation rate
reduction can be achieved by different interactions with the halo gas: the jet
has a larger effect on the hot halo gas while leaving the denser, star forming
phase in place, while the wind acts more locally on the star forming phase,
which manifests itself in different time-variability properties.

main stellar properties from a set of pre-computed evolutionary tracks. We

exploring a number of models for electron-capture, core-collapse and
pair-instability supernovae, different assumptions for common envelope,
stability of mass transfer, quasi-homogeneous evolution and stellar tides. We
find that stellar evolution has a dramatic impact on the formation of single

efficiency we obtain with SEVN show significant differences with respect to the
results of other population-synthesis codes, even when the same
binary-evolution parameters are used. For example, the main traditional
formation channel of BCOs is strongly suppressed in our models: at high
metallicity ($Z\gtrsim{0.01}$) only $<20$% of the merging binary black holes
and binary neutron stars form via this channel, while other authors found
fractions $>70$%. The local BCO merger rate density of our fiducial models is
consistent with the most recent estimates by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA

representation of the Wilson line, certain defect operators can become
marginal, leading to interesting renormalization group flows and for
sufficiently large representations to complete or partial screening by charged
fields. This result is universal: in large enough representations, Wilson lines
are screened by the charged matter fields. We observe that the onset of the
screening instability is associated with fixed-point mergers. We study this
phenomenon in a variety of applications. In some cases, the screening of the
Wilson lines takes place by dimensional transmutation and the generation of an
exponentially large scale. We identify the space of infrared conformal Wilson
lines in weakly coupled gauge theories in 3+1 dimensions and determine the
screening cloud due to bosons or fermions. We also study QED in 2+1 dimensions
in the large $N_f$ limit and identify the nontrivial conformal Wilson lines. We
briefly discuss 't Hooft lines in 3+1-dimensional gauge theories and find that
they are screened in weakly coupled gauge theories with simply connected gauge
groups. In non-Abelian gauge theories with S-duality, this together with our

twist defects in MSCs can encode twice the amount of topologically protected

to twists encoding both logical qubits and ""logical MZMs,"" with the latter
enhancing the protection microscopic MZMs can offer. We explain how to perform
universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while using far
fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be
implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce
measurement-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical
qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also
show that logical MZMs result in an improved scaling of spatial overheads with
respect to code distance for all steps of the computation. Finally, we
introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded
Clifford gates in small codes by braiding microscopic MZMs. MSC twist defects
thus open new paths towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.

predicted to be influenced by the growth of their host dark matter halos. This
co-evolution potentially leaves signatures in present-day observed galaxy
properties, which might be essential to further understand how the growth and
properties of galaxies are connected to those of their host halos. In this
work, we study the evolutionary histories of nearby galaxies both in terms of
their host halos and the scatter of the star-forming main sequence by
investigating their time-resolved stellar populations using absorption optical
spectra drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that galaxy star
formation histories depend on the masses of their host halos, and hence they
shape the evolution of the star-forming main sequence over cosmic time.
Additionally, we also find that the scatter around the z=0 star-forming main
sequence is not (entirely) stochastic, as galaxies with currently different
star formation rates have experienced, on average, different star formation
histories. Our findings suggest that dark matter halos might play a key role in
modulating the evolution of star formation in galaxies, and thus of the main
sequence, and further demonstrate that galaxies at different evolutionary
stages contribute to the observed scatter of this relation.

outflows -- jets -- that drill their way out of collapsing massive stars.
Accurately modeling this process requires realistic stellar profiles for the
jets to propagate through and break out of. Most previous studies have used
simple power laws or pre-collapse models for massive stars. However, the
relevant stellar profile for lGRB models is in fact that of a star after its
core has collapsed to form a compact object. To self-consistently compute such
a stellar profile, we use the open-source code GR1D to simulate the
core-collapse process for a suite of low-metallicity, rotating, massive stellar
progenitors that have undergone chemically homogeneous evolution. Our models
span a range of zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses: $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 13,
18, 21, 25, 35, 40$, and $45 M_\odot$. All of these models, at the onset of
core-collapse, feature steep density profiles, $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with
$\alpha\approx 2.5$, which would result in jets that are inconsistent with lGRB
observables. We follow the collapse of four out of our seven models until they
form BHs and the other three proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We find, across all
models, that the density profile outside of the newly-formed BH or PNS is
well-represented by a flatter power law with $\alpha \approx 1.35{-}1.55$. Such
flat density profiles are conducive to successful formation and breakout of
BH-powered jets and, in fact, required to reproduce observable properties of
lGRBs. Future models of lGRBs should be initialized with shallower
\textit{post-collapse} stellar profiles like those presented here instead of
the much steeper pre-collapse profiles that are typically used.

gradual transition from star-forming galaxies with narrow emission lines and

high-quality quasar spectra, which might not capture the full diversity of the
quasar population. In this study, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic
model, \textit{Quasar Factor Analysis} (QFA), which combines factor analysis
(FA) with physical priors of the intergalactic medium (IGM) to overcome these
limitations. QFA captures the posterior distribution of quasar continua through
generatively modeling quasar spectra. We demonstrate that QFA can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, $\sim 2\%$ relative error, for continuum
prediction in the Ly$\alpha$ forest region compared to previous methods. We
further fit 90,678 $2<\mathrm{z}<3.5$, SNR$>2$ quasar spectra from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 and found that for $\sim 30\%$ quasar
spectra where the continua were ill-determined with previous methods, QFA
yields visually more plausible continua. QFA also attains $\lesssim 1\%$ error
in the 1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum measurements at $\mathrm{z}\sim 3$ and
$\sim 4\%$ in $\mathrm{z}\sim 2.4$. In addition, QFA determines latent factors
representing more physically motivated than PCA. We investigate the evolution
of the latent factors and report no significant redshift or luminosity
dependency except for the Baldwin effect. The generative nature of QFA also
enables outlier detection robustly; we showed that QFA is effective in
selecting outlying quasar spectra, including damped Ly$\alpha$ systems and
potential Type II quasar spectra.

and mixing fermions with a time-dependent mass and a weak coupling to a thermal

  We introduce a new local approximation (LA) method and use it to derive
quantum kinetic equations which can describe coherence and also include effects
of the spectral width. The method is based on a local ansatz of the collision
term. We also improve the earlier coherent quasiparticle approximation (cQPA)
by giving a straightforward derivation of the spectral ansatz, a new way of
organizing the gradient expansion, and a transparent way to derive the
coherence-gradient resummed collision term. In both methods the transport
equations can describe flavor coherence and particle--antiparticle coherence,
and the related oscillations, of the mixing fermions.
  In addition to formulating the local equations we apply them to baryogenesis
in the early universe. More specifically, we study the details of CP-asymmetry
generation in resonant leptogenesis and the evolution of the axial vector
current in electroweak baryogenesis (in a time-dependent analogue). We solve
the equations numerically, and perform extensive analysis and compare the
results to semiclassical (Boltzmann) equations. The results cover known
semiclassical effects. We find that dynamical treatment of local quantum
coherence is necessary for an accurate description of CP-asymmetry generation.
When these details are known they can then be partially incorporated into
simpler (e.g. semiclassical) approaches. However, coherent quantum kinetic
equations are needed for accurate results across different scenarios or wide
parameter ranges.

widely used Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton accretion into the binary phase and
incorporates preferential mass accretion onto the secondary SMBH, which is
motivated by results from small-scale hydrodynamical circumbinary disc
simulations. We perform idealised gas-rich disc galaxy merger simulations using
pure thermal or pure kinetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Our binary
accretion model provides more physically motivated SMBH mass ratios, which are
one of the key parameters for computing gravitational wave (GW) induced recoil
velocities. The merger time-scales of our simulated SMBH binaries are in the
range $t_{\rm merge}{\sim} 10$--$400$ Myr. Prograde in-plane equal-mass galaxy
mergers lead to the shortest merger time-scales, as they experience the
strongest starbursts, with the ensuing high stellar density resulting in a
rapid SMBH coalescence. Compared to the thermal AGN feedback, the kinetic AGN
feedback predicts longer merger time-scales and results in more core-like
stellar profiles, as it is more effective in removing gas from the galaxy
centre and quenching star formation. This suggests that the AGN feedback
implementation plays a critical role in modelling SMBH coalescences. Our model
will be useful for improving the modelling of SMBH mergers in gas-rich

expected to be the result of the interplay between the minimum angle of such
radiation due to transverse momentum broadening and the dead-cone angle. Since
the measurement of a fully corrected Lund plane in heavy-ion collisions is
currently challenging, we propose to use jet grooming techniques to identify a
particular splitting in the jet tree that is both perturbative and sensitive to
the dead-cone effect. To that end, we propose a new jet substructure groomer,
dubbed Late-$k_t$, that selects the most collinear splitting in a QCD jet above
a certain transverse momentum cutoff $k_{t,\rm{cut}}$. The role of
$k_{t,\rm{cut}}$ is to guarantee perturbative splittings, while selecting the
most collinear splitting enhances the sensitivity to mass effects. As a proof
of concept, we study the angular distribution of the splitting tagged by
Late-$k_t$ both analytically and with Monte Carlo simulations. First, we derive
the logarithmic resummation structure in vacuum and demonstrate its capability
to distinguish between inclusive and heavy-flavoured jets. Next, we extend the
calculation for in-medium jets and show that medium-induced emissions lead to
an enhancement of collinear emissions below the dead cone angle. Numerically,
we demonstrate an excellent resilience of Late-$k_t$ against uncorrelated
thermal background, thus confirming this observable as a potential candidate to
unveil medium dynamics around the dead cone regime.

VIPERS survey statistical power, which observed $\sim90,000$ galaxies at $z >

distinguish 12 galaxy classes. Studies of their environmental dependence
indicate that this classification may actually reflect different galaxy
evolutionary paths. For instance, a class of the most passive red galaxies
gathers galaxies $\sim20\%$ smaller than other red galaxies of a similar
stellar mass, revealing the first sample of red nuggets at intermediate
redshift. On the other end, a class of blue dwarf galaxies is composed mainly
of AGN, challenging commonly used mid-infrared AGN selections.

exoplanets. Despite this abundance, our understanding of the nature and
compositional diversity of sub-Neptunes remains limited, to a large part
because atmospheric studies via transmission spectroscopy almost exclusively
aimed for low-density sub-Neptunes and even those were often affected by
high-altitude clouds. The recent TESS discovery of the hot, dense TOI-824b
($2.93\,R_\oplus$ and $18.47\,M_\oplus$) opens a new window into sub-Neptune
science by enabling the study of a dense sub-Neptune via secondary eclipses.
Here, we present the detection of TOI-824b's hot day side via Spitzer secondary
eclipse observations in the $3.6$ and $4.5\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ channels, combined
with a reanalysis of its interior composition. The measured eclipse depths
(142$^{+57}_{-52}$ and 245$^{+75}_{-77}$ ppm) and brightness temperatures
(1463$^{+183}_{-196}$ and 1484$^{+180}_{-202}$ K) indicate a poor heat
redistribution ($f>$ 0.49) and a low Bond albedo (A$_{B}<$ 0.26). We conclude
that TOI-824b could be an ""exposed Neptune mantle"": a planet with a
Neptune-like water-rich interior that never accreted a hydrogen envelope or
that subsequently lost it. The hot day-side temperature is then naturally
explained by a high-metallicity envelope re-emitting the bulk of the incoming
radiation from the day side. TOI-824b's density is also consistent with a
massive rocky core that accreted up to 1% of hydrogen, but the observed eclipse
depths favor our high-metallicity GCM simulation to a solar-metallicity GCM
simulation with a likelihood ratio of 7:1. The new insights into TOI-824b's
nature suggest that the sub-Neptune population may be more diverse than
previously thought, with some of the dense hot sub-Neptunes potentially not
hosting a hydrogen-rich envelope as generally assumed for sub-Neptunes.

Jets propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) as the jet shower evolves;
their interaction with the QGP, known as jet quenching, generates observable
phenomena that provide incisive probes of the structure and dynamics of the
QGP. For instance, medium-induced modification of jet substructure probes color
coherence, and may be sensitive to differences in quark and gluon energy loss
due to their different Casimir factors. Jet grooming can be used to focus on
specific regions of phase space, isolating medium-induced effects on hard
splittings in the jet shower. ALICE is well suited for such substructure
measurements due to its precise charged-particle tracking, which enables
high-efficiency measurements of narrow splittings in jets down to low
transverse momentum. In these proceedings several recent jet substructure
measurements in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV are
reported, for both ungroomed jets and jets that have been groomed using the
Soft Drop and Dynamical Grooming algorithms. Measurements of the groomed jet
radius, $\theta_g \equiv R_g/R$; the groomed jet momentum fraction, $z_g$; and
the groomed relative transverse momentum, $k_{\mathrm{T,g}}$ are reported.
These measurements show direct evidence of modification of the angular
structure of jets in the QGP, and provide new constraints on the search for
large-angle scattering of jets off of quasi-particles by interaction with the
QGP. New measurements of sub-jet fragmentation, generalized jet angularities,
and jet-axis differences, which provide insight into the angular and momentum
structure of modified jets are also presented. Comparisons to model

potential to transfer the successes of reinforcement learning (RL) to domains
where data collection is acutely problematic. In this offline setting, a key
challenge is overcoming overestimation bias for actions not present in data
which, without the ability to correct for via interaction with the environment,
can propagate and compound during training, leading to highly sub-optimal
policies. One simple method to reduce this bias is to introduce a policy
constraint via behavioural cloning (BC), which encourages agents to pick
actions closer to the source data. By finding the right balance between RL and
BC such approaches have been shown to be surprisingly effective while requiring
minimal changes to the underlying algorithms they are based on. To date this
balance has been held constant, but in this work we explore the idea of tipping
this balance towards RL following initial training. Using TD3-BC, we
demonstrate that by continuing to train a policy offline while reducing the
influence of the BC component we can produce refined policies that outperform
the original baseline, as well as match or exceed the performance of more
complex alternatives. Furthermore, we demonstrate such an approach can be used
for stable online fine-tuning, allowing policies to be safely improved during
deployment.

DST is observed in a large range of volume fraction presenting some
specificities relatively to other systems. In particular, in a given range of
volume fraction, the DST transition appears suddenly without being preceded by
shear thickening. The presence of a frictional network of particles is
confirmed by a simultaneous measurement of the electric resistance of the
suspension and of the rheological curve. Using the Wyart-Cates model we show
that, increasing the volume fraction, the fraction of frictional contacts grows
more and more quickly with the stress that disagrees with the prediction of
computer simulations. The same kind of behavior is observed in the presence of
a magnetic field with, in addition, a very strong increase of the viscosity
with the magnetic field before the transition. We interpret this behavior by
the interpenetration of the polymer layer under the effect of the shear
stress-and of the magnetic stress-followed by the expulsion of the polymer out
of the surfaces. Besides we point that, above the DST transition, we do not
observe a jamming in the range of volume fraction whereas it is predicted by
the W-C model. Based on the fact that in the absence of shear flow, the polymer
should come back to the surface and destroy the frictional contacts we can
predict an asymptotic non-zero shear rate and reproduce the experimental

to within additive error $\epsilon$ provided $\mathrm{Tr}(O^2)\leq B$ and
$\lVert O \rVert = 1$. Our main result applies to the joint measurement

structure with well-defined and computable geodesics on its configuration
space. This general result applies to concrete classes of articulated objects
such as robot manipulators, and we demonstrate as a proof of concept the
computation of geodesic paths for a free flying rod and planar robotic arms as
well as their use in path planning with many obstacles.

many image processing and computer vision tasks. However, a standard CNN model
is not invariant to image rotations. In fact, even slight rotation of an input
image will seriously degrade its performance. This shortcoming precludes the
use of CNN in some practical scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we focus on
designing convolutional layer with good rotation invariance. Specifically,
based on a simple rotation-invariant coordinate system, we propose a new
convolutional operation, called Rotation-Invariant Coordinate Convolution
(RIC-C). Without additional trainable parameters and data augmentation, RIC-C
is naturally invariant to arbitrary rotations around the input center.
Furthermore, we find the connection between RIC-C and deformable convolution,
and propose a simple but efficient approach to implement RIC-C using Pytorch.
By replacing all standard convolutional layers in a CNN with the corresponding
RIC-C, a RIC-CNN can be derived. Using MNIST dataset, we first evaluate the
rotation invariance of RIC-CNN and compare its performance with most of
existing rotation-invariant CNN models. It can be observed that RIC-CNN
achieves the state-of-the-art classification on the rotated test dataset of
MNIST. Then, we deploy RIC-C to VGG, ResNet and DenseNet, and conduct the
classification experiments on two real image datasets. Also, a shallow CNN and
the corresponding RIC-CNN are trained to extract image patch descriptors, and
we compare their performance in patch verification. These experimental results
again show that RIC-C can be easily used as drop in replacement for standard
convolutions, and greatly enhances the rotation invariance of CNN models
designed for different applications.

significantly to the uncertainty in GCM predictions. One approach to improving
the accuracy of a coarse-grid global climate model is to add machine-learned

We train neural networks to learn the state-dependent temperature, humidity,

ordinary systems, first in the usual way having the Schr\""{o}dinger equation
and second by promoting them as parametrized theories by introducing embedding
coordinate fields, which yields first class constraints and the WDW equation.
We observe that the time evolution in the WDW framework can be described with

determines a suitable Hilbert space with a viable probability interpretation.

diffusive dynamics in the leading edge of invasion fronts. To overcome this, we
introduce coordinate transformations which allow us to recognize a leading
order diffusive equation relying only on an assumption of generic marginal

detailed description of diffusive dynamics in the leading edge, which we match
with a traveling invasion front in the wake. We then establish front selection
by controlling these matching errors in a nonlinear iteration scheme, relying
on sharp estimates on the linearization about the invasion front. Using
appropriate rescalings and a functional analytic approach to regularize
singular perturbations, we show that our assumptions hold in general
reaction-diffusion systems when the nonlinearity undergoes a transcritical,

distributed plastic behaviour with increasing pressure and temperature. This
brittle-plastic is empirically observed to occur when the material strength
becomes lower than the confining stress, which is termed Goetze's criterion.
Such a criterion works well for most silicates but is not universal for all
materials. We aim to determine the microphysical controls and stress-strain
behaviour of rocks in the brittle-plastic transition. We use a micro-mechanical
approach due to Horii and Nemat-Nasser, and consider representative volume
elements containing sliding wing-cracks and plastic zones. We find solutions
for frictional slip, plastic deformation and crack opening at constant
confining pressure, and obtain stress-strain evolution. We show that the
brittle-plastic transition depends on the confining stress, fracture toughness
and plastic yield stress but also critically on the friction coefficient on
preexisting defects. Materials with low friction are expected to be more
brittle, and experience transition to fully plastic flow at higher pressure
than anticipated from Goetze's criterion. The overall success of Goetze's
criterion for the brittle-plastic transition in rocks is likely arising from
the low toughness, high strength, and medium friction coefficient character of
most rock forming minerals.

velocity spectrograph MAROON-X to measure the obliquity of the late M dwarf
TRAPPIST-1. With the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, we measure a system obliquity
of $-2^{+17}_{-19}$ degrees and a stellar rotational velocity of 2.1 $\pm$ 0.3
km s$^{-1}$. We were unable to detect stellar surface differential rotation,

the both the slow rotation of the star and the low SNR of the data. Overall,
TRAPPIST-1 appears to have a low obliquity, which could imply that the system

whose accuracy tightens as the number of agents increases relative to the
number of coupled constraints. Next, we form an equivalent Lagrangian saddle
point problem, and then regularize the Lagrangian in both the primal and dual
spaces to create a regularized Lagrangian that is
strongly-convex-strongly-concave. We then develop a parallelized algorithm to
compute saddle points of the regularized Lagrangian. This algorithm partitions
problems into blocks, which are either scalars or sub-vectors of the primal or
dual decision variables, and it is shown to tolerate asynchrony in the
computations and communications of primal and dual variables. Suboptimality
bounds and convergence rates are presented for convergence to a saddle point.
The suboptimality bound includes (i) the regularization error induced by
regularizing the Lagrangian and (ii) the suboptimality gap between solutions to
the original MILP and its relaxed form. Simulation results illustrate these
theoretical developments in practice, and show that relaxation and
regularization together have only a mild impact on the quality of solution

shallow dependence on the spin-down energy, proportional to
$\dot{E}^{0.15\pm0.04}$, that contradicts some previous proposals of population

steepness of the observed flux density spectra and $\dot{E}$, and correlations
of the fractional linear polarization with $\dot{E}$, the spectral index, and
the pulse width, which we discuss in the context of what is known about pulsar
radio emission and how pulsars evolve with time. On the whole, we do not see
significant correlations with the estimated surface magnetic field strength,

of GCNs and GATs, we show that there exists no clear winner between the three
(neither theoretically nor in practice) as their performance directly depends
on the nature of the data (i.e., of the graph and features). This result brings
us to the main contribution of our work, the learnable graph convolutional
attention network (L-CAT): a GNN architecture that automatically interpolates
between GCN, GAT and CAT in each layer, by adding only two scalar parameters.
Our results demonstrate that L-CAT is able to efficiently combine different GNN
layers along the network, outperforming competing methods in a wide range of
datasets, and resulting in a more robust model that reduces the need of
cross-validating.

built covert channels using different MESMs on Windows and Linux, including

complexity of solving a linear program with $d$ variables and $n$ constraints
as the expected running time when Gaussian noise of variance $\sigma^2$ is
added to the LP data. We prove that the smoothed complexity of the simplex

$1/\sigma$ compared to the previous bound of $O(\sigma^{-2} d^2\sqrt{\log n})$.
We accomplish this through a new analysis of the \emph{shadow bound}, key to

two-dimensional polygons.

tracking and real-time simulation. We rely on rigorous calibration routines to
ensure that the digital twin representation precisely mimics all real-world

Significantly, Twin-S updates and reflects real-world drilling of the

We further illustrate how segmentation masks derived from the continuously

minimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose
LoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of
self-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted
semantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features. In a warm-up

lack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art
Macaw question-answering (QA) model answers 'Yes' to 'Is a sparrow a bird?' and
'Does a bird have feet?' but answers 'No' to 'Does a sparrow have feet?'. To
address this failure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction
through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and
accuracy of pre-trained NLP models using pre-trained natural language inference
(NLI) models without fine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs,
ConCoRD samples several candidate outputs for each input and instantiates a
factor graph that accounts for both the model's belief about the likelihood of
each answer choice in isolation and the NLI model's beliefs about pair-wise
answer choice compatibility. We show that a weighted MaxSAT solver can
efficiently compute high-quality answer choices under this factor graph,
improving over the raw model's predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of off-the-shelf
closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models, notably
increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5% absolute. See

we aim to reduce the severity of mistakes made by neural networks in

generate targeted adversarial attacks during the training process in order to
increase the semantic similarity between a model's predictions and true labels

characterize these atmospheres. However, based on observations of Earth and

weather and long-term climate variability, implying that cloud cover may be
less during some observing periods. We identify and describe a mechanism
driving periodic clear sky events at the terminators in simulations of tidally
locked Earth-like planets. A feedback between dayside cloud radiative effects,
incoming stellar radiation and heating, and the dynamical state of the
atmosphere, especially the zonal wavenumber-1 Rossby wave identified in past
work on tidally locked planets, leads to oscillations in Rossby wave phase
speeds and in the position of Rossby gyres and results in advection of clouds
to or away from the planet's eastern terminator. We study this oscillation in

dynamic game. Second, we study both cooperative and non-cooperative solutions
to this RICE dynamic game. In cooperative settings, we investigate the global
social welfare equilibrium that maximizes the weighted and cumulative social
welfare across regions. We next divide the regions into two clusters: developed
and developing, and look at the social welfare frontier under the notion of
Pareto optimality. We also present a receding horizon approach to approximate
the global social welfare equilibrium for robustness and computational
efficiency. For non-cooperative settings, we study best-response dynamics and
open-loop Nash equilibrium of the RICE game. A Recursive Best-response
Algorithm for Dynamic Games (RBA-DG) is proposed to describe the sequences of
best-response decisions for dynamic games, which indicates convergence to
open-loop Nash equilibrium when applied to the RICE game by numerical studies.
We also study online receding horizon feedback decisions of the RICE game. A

All these proposed solution concepts are implemented and open sourced using the

regional relations shape climate change for our future.

physics threshold is expected to emerge in the TeV regime. We extend the
Standard Model by adding an arbitrary SU(2) dark matter multiplet in non-chiral
representation. The pseudo-real representations can be viable DM candidates
providing that one includes a higher dimensional mass-splitting operator, which
avoids the tree-level inelastic scattering through Z-boson exchange. These
effective operators give rise to sizable contributions from Higgs mediated dark
matter interactions with quarks and gluons. A linear combination of the
effective couplings named $\lambda$ is identified as the critical parameter in
determining the magnitude of the cross-section. When $\lambda$ is smaller than
the critical value, the theory behaves similar to the known renormalisable
model, and the scattering rate stays below the current experimental reach.
Nevertheless, above the criticality, the contribution from the higher
dimensional operators significantly changes the phenomenology. The scattering
amplitude of pseudo-real models will be coherently enhanced, so that it would
be possible for next generation large-exposure experiments to fully probe these
multiplets. We studied the parameter space of the theory, taking into account
both indirect astrophysical and direct search constraints. It is inferred that
multi-TeV mass scale remains a viable region, quite promising for forthcoming

maintain a far-from-equilibrium steady state and perform work. The entropy
production measures how far from equilibrium such a particle system operates
and serves as a proxy for the work performed. Field theory offers a promising
route to calculating entropy production, as it allows for many interacting
particles to be considered simultaneously. Approximate field theories obtained
by coarse-graining or smoothing that draw on additive noise can capture
densities and correlations well, but they generally ignore the microscopic
particle nature of the constituents, thereby producing spurious results for the
entropy production. As an alternative we demonstrate how to use Doi-Peliti
field theories, which capture the microscopic dynamics, including reactions and
interactions with external and pair potentials. Such field theories are in
principle exact, while offering a systematic approximation scheme, in the form
of diagrammatics. We demonstrate how to construct them from a Fokker-Planck
equation (FPE) of the single-particle dynamics and show how to calculate
entropy production of active matter from first principles. This framework is
easily extended to include interaction. We use it to derive exact, compact and
efficient general expressions for the entropy production for a vast range of
interacting particle systems. These expressions are independent of the
underlying field theory and can be interpreted as the spatial average of the
local entropy production. They are readily applicable to numerical and
experimental data. In general, any pair interaction draws at most on the three
point, equal time density and an n-point interaction on the (2n-1)-point
density. We illustrate the technique in a number of exact, tractable examples,
including some with pair-interaction.

compete, and the thermal fluctuations can reduce the effectiveness of the
quenched disorder, leading to a reentrant ordered phase in agreement with the
predictions of Nelson [Phys. Rev. B 27, 2902 (1983)]. The onset of the
reentrant phase can be deduced based on changes in the transport response,
where the reentrant ordering appears as an increase in the mobility or the
occurrence of a depinning transition. We also find that when the system is in
the ordered state and thermally melts, there is an increase in the effective
damping or pinning. This produces a drop in the electron mobility that is
similar to the peak effect phenomenon found in superconducting vortices, where
thermal effects soften the lattice or break down its elasticity, allowing the

Stable coloring, also called color refinement, is a well-studied technique in

lossless representations of graphs. However, its usefulness is limited due to
its reliance on strict symmetries. Real data compresses very poorly using color
refinement. We propose the first, to our knowledge, approximate color
refinement scheme, which we call quasi-stable coloring. By using approximation,
we alleviate the need for strict symmetry, and allow for a tradeoff between the
degree of compression and the accuracy of the representation. We study three
applications: Linear Programming, Max-Flow, and Betweenness Centrality, and
provide theoretical evidence in each case that a quasi-stable coloring can lead
to good approximations on the reduced graph. Next, we consider how to compute a
maximal quasi-stable coloring: we prove that, in general, this problem is
NP-hard, and propose a simple, yet effective algorithm based on heuristics.
Finally, we evaluate experimentally the quasi-stable coloring technique on
several real graphs and applications, comparing with prior approximation
techniques.

implementation. Because the Data Center network's extreme scale performance
requires hardware implementation, which is only accessible to a few. However,
the emergence of reconfigurable match-action table (RMT) paradigm-based
switches have finally opened up the development life cycle of data plane
devices. The P4 language is the dominant language choice for programming these
devices. Now, Network operators can implement the desired feature over white
box RMT switches. The process involves an innovator writing new algorithms in
the P4 language and getting them compiled for the target hardware. However,
there is still a roadblock. After designing an algorithm, the P4 program's
compilation technology is not fully open-source. Thus, it is very difficult for
an average researcher to get deep insight into the performance of his/her
innovation when executed at the silicon level. There is no open-source compiler
backend available for this purpose. Proprietary compiler backends provided by
different hardware vendors are available for this purpose. However, they are
closed-source and do not provide access to the internal mapping mechanisms.
Which inhibits experimenting with new mapping algorithms and innovative
instruction sets for reconfigurable match-action table architecture. This paper
describes our work toward an open-source compiler backend for compiling P416
targeted for the V1Model architecture-based programmable switches.

end-to-end with all the data available at once by minimizing the empirical risk
on the whole training set. On the inference side, after training the model, the
user fetches a static computation graph and runs the full model on some
specified observed mixture signal to get the estimated source signals.
Additionally, many of those models consist of several basic processing blocks
which are applied sequentially. We argue that we can significantly increase
resource efficiency during both training and inference stages by reformulating
a model's training and inference procedures as iterative mappings of latent
signal representations. First, we can apply the same processing block more than
once on its output to refine the input signal and consequently improve
parameter efficiency. During training, we can follow a block-wise procedure
which enables a reduction on memory requirements. Thus, one can train a very
complicated network structure using significantly less computation compared to
end-to-end training. During inference, we can dynamically adjust how many
processing blocks and iterations of a specific block an input signal needs
using a gating module.

of sets of species believed to have undergone hybridization or gene flow during
their evolution. The mutation process for a set of such species can be modeled
as a Markov process on a phylogenetic network. Previous work has shown that a
site-pattern probability distributions from a Jukes-Cantor phylogenetic network
model must satisfy certain algebraic invariants. As a corollary, aspects of the
phylogenetic network are theoretically identifiable from site-pattern
frequencies. In practice, because of the probabilistic nature of sequence
evolution, the phylogenetic network invariants will rarely be satisfied, even
for data generated under the model. Thus, using network invariants for
inferring phylogenetic networks requires some means of interpreting the
residuals, or deviations from zero, when observed site-pattern frequencies are
substituted into the invariants. In this work, we propose a method of utilizing
invariant residuals and support vector machines to infer 4-leaf level-one
phylogenetic networks, from which larger networks can be reconstructed. Given
data for a set of species, the support vector machine is first trained on model
data to learn the patterns of residuals corresponding to different network
structures to classify the network that produced the data. We demonstrate the
performance of our method on simulated data from the specified model and

extractor for identity retrieval without exploiting identity labels. Due to the
blind trust in imperfect clustering results, the learning is inevitably misled
by unreliable pseudo labels. Albeit the pseudo label refinement has been
investigated by previous works, they generally leverage auxiliary information
such as camera IDs and body part predictions. This work explores the internal
characteristics of clusters to refine pseudo labels. To this end,
Confidence-Guided Centroids (CGC) are proposed to provide reliable cluster-wise
prototypes for feature learning. Since samples with high confidence are
exclusively involved in the formation of centroids, the identity information of
low-confidence samples, i.e., boundary samples, are NOT likely to contribute to
the corresponding centroid. Given the new centroids, current learning scheme,
where samples are enforced to learn from their assigned centroids solely, is
unwise. To remedy the situation, we propose to use Confidence-Guided pseudo
Label (CGL), which enables samples to approach not only the originally assigned
centroid but other centroids that are potentially embedded with their identity
information. Empowered by confidence-guided centroids and labels, our method
yields comparable performance with, or even outperforms, state-of-the-art
pseudo label refinement works that largely leverage auxiliary information.

high degrees of freedom, unmodeled nonlinear dynamics, or random disturbances
from the environment. A commonly adopted solution to overcome these challenges
is to use optimization-based algorithms and approximate the system with a
simplified, reduced-order model. Additionally, deep neural networks are
becoming a more promising option for achieving agile and robust legged
locomotion. These approaches, however, either require large amounts of onboard
calculations or the collection of millions of data points from a single robot.
To address these problems and improve tracking performance, this paper proposes
a method based on iterative learning control. This method lets a robot learn
from its own mistakes by exploiting the repetitive nature of legged locomotion
within only a few trials. Then, a torque library is created as a lookup table
so that the robot does not need to repeat calculations or learn the same skill
over and over again. This process resembles how animals learn their muscle
memories in nature. The proposed method is tested on the A1 robot in a
simulated environment, and it allows the robot to pronk at different speeds
while precisely following the reference trajectories without heavy
calculations.

Euclidean spaces has attracted significant attention for the past decade. A
central problem in the coreset literature is to understand what is the best
possible coreset size for $(k,z)$-clustering in Euclidean space. While there
has been significant progress in the problem, there is still a gap between the
state-of-the-art upper and lower bounds. For instance, the best known upper
bound for $k$-means ($z=2$) is $\min \{O(k^{3/2} \varepsilon^{-2}),O(k
\varepsilon^{-4})\}$ [1,2], while the best known lower bound is
$\Omega(k\varepsilon^{-2})$ [1].
  In this paper, we make significant progress on both upper and lower bounds.
For a large range of parameters (i.e., $\varepsilon, k$), we have a complete
understanding of the optimal coreset size. In particular, we obtain the
following results:
  (1) We present a new coreset lower bound $\Omega(k \varepsilon^{-z-2})$ for
Euclidean $(k,z)$-clustering when $\varepsilon \geq \Omega(k^{-1/(z+2)})$. In
view of the prior upper bound $\tilde{O}_z(k \varepsilon^{-z-2})$ [1], the
bound is optimal. The new lower bound is surprising since
$\Omega(k\varepsilon^{-2})$ [1] is ``conjectured"" to be the correct bound in
some recent works (see e.g., [1,2]]).
  (2) For the upper bound, we provide efficient coreset construction algorithms
for Euclidean $(k,z)$-clustering with improved coreset sizes. In particular, we
provide an $\tilde{O}_z(k^{\frac{2z+2}{z+2}} \varepsilon^{-2})$-sized coreset,
with a unfied analysis, for $(k,z)$-clustering for all $z\geq 1$ in Euclidean
space.

Several deep learning models have been proposed for visible-infrared (V-I)
person ReID to recognize individuals from images captured using RGB and IR
cameras. However, performance may decline considerably if RGB and IR images
captured at test time are corrupted (e.g., noise, blur, and weather
conditions). Although various data augmentation (DA) methods have been explored
to improve the generalization capacity, these are not adapted for V-I person
ReID. In this paper, a specialized DA strategy is proposed to address this
multimodal setting. Given both the V and I modalities, this strategy allows to
diminish the impact of corruption on the accuracy of deep person ReID models.
Corruption may be modality-specific, and an additional modality often provides
complementary information. Our multimodal DA strategy is designed specifically
to encourage modality collaboration and reinforce generalization capability.
For instance, punctual masking of modalities forces the model to select the
informative modality. Local DA is also explored for advanced selection of
features within and among modalities. The impact of training baseline fusion
models for V-I person ReID using the proposed multimodal DA strategy is
assessed on corrupted versions of the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD
datasets in terms of complexity and efficiency. Results indicate that using our
strategy provides V-I ReID models the ability to exploit both shared and
individual modality knowledge so they can outperform models trained with no or
unimodal DA. GitHub code: https://github.com/art2611/ML-MDA.

Additionally, most current gaze estimation models require the use of either

implements the ResNet and Inception model architectures and makes predictions
using only one eye image. Furthermore, we propose an ensemble calibration

subject-specific predictions. With the use of lightweight architectures, we
achieve high performance on the GazeCapture dataset with very low model

of 1.591 cm on the test set without calibration and 1.439 cm with an ensemble
calibration model. With just one eye as input, we still achieve an average
prediction error of 2.312 cm on the test set without calibration and 1.951 cm

network bandwidth utilization without congesting the network and ensure
fairness among contending transfers. We extensively evaluated our RL-based

to enhance the sum-of-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of a two-user multiple-input

two-user MIMO IC with arbitrary antenna configurations. In particular, RIS
beamforming, transmit zero-forcing, and interference decoding are integrated
together to combat the interference problem. In order to maximize the
achievable sum-DoF, an integer optimization problem is formulated to optimize
the number of eliminating interference links by RIS beamforming. As a result,
the derived achievable sum-DoF can be higher than the sum-DoF of two-user MIMO
IC, leading to a RIS gain. Furthermore, a sufficient condition of the RIS gain
is given as the relationship between the number of RIS elements and the antenna

  Timed requests : In this variant, each demand request is a pair $(x,t)$ where

not always be enhanced by knowledge learned from a source domain, especially
when the source domain has sparse data. In this study, we propose CAT-ART, a

participating domains through representation learning and embedding transfer.
Our method consists of two parts: a self-supervised Contrastive AuToencoder
(CAT) framework to generate global user embeddings based on information from
all participating domains, and an Attention-based Representation Transfer (ART)
framework which transfers domain-specific user embeddings from other domains to

  Methods: We used a linked dataset including hospital administrative data,

patients who received catheter ablation for AF. Traditional and deep survival
models were trained to predict major bleeding events and a composite of heart
failure, stroke, cardiac arrest, and death.
  Results: Out of a total of 3285 patients in the cohort, 177 (5.3%)
experienced the composite outcome (heart failure, stroke, cardiac arrest,
death) and 167 (5.1%) experienced major bleeding events after catheter ablation
treatment. Models predicting the composite outcome had high risk discrimination
accuracy, with the best model having a concordance index > 0.79 at the
evaluated time horizons. Models for predicting major bleeding events had poor
risk discrimination performance, with all models having a concordance index <
0.66. The most impactful features for the models predicting higher risk were
comorbidities indicative of poor health, older age, and therapies commonly used

  Conclusions: Diagnosis and medication history did not contain sufficient
information for precise risk prediction of experiencing major bleeding events.
The models for predicting the composite outcome have the potential to enable

increasing preliminary evidences that the RM behaviors of broad emission lines
are influenced by BLR densities, however, the influences have not been
investigated systematically from theoretical perspective. In the present paper,
we adopt locally optimally emitting cloud model and use CLOUDY to obtain the
one-dimensional transfer functions of the prominent UV and optical emission
lines for different BLR densities. We find that the influences of BLR densities
to RM behaviors have mainly three aspects. First, rarefied BLRs (with low gas
densities) may show anomalous responses in RM observations. Their emission-line
light curves inversely response the variations of continuum light curves, which
may have been observed in some UV RM campaigns. Second, the different BLR
densities in AGNs may result in correlations between the time lags and
equivalent widths of emission lines, and may contribute to the scatters of the
radius-luminosity relationships. Third, the variations of BLR densities may
explain the changes of time lags in individual objects in different years. Some
weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) are probably extreme cases of rarefied BLRs.

rendering (DR) is an active research topic in computer vision. DR-based methods
minimize the difference between the rendered and target images by optimizing
both the shape and appearance and realizing a high visual reproductivity.
However, most approaches perform poorly for textureless objects because of the
geometrical ambiguity, which means that multiple shapes can have the same
rendered result in such objects. To overcome this problem, we introduce active
sensing with structured light (SL) into multi-view 3D object reconstruction
based on DR to learn the unknown geometry and appearance of arbitrary scenes
and camera poses. More specifically, our framework leverages the
correspondences between pixels in different views calculated by structured
light as an additional constraint in the DR-based optimization of implicit
surface, color representations, and camera poses. Because camera poses can be
optimized simultaneously, our method realizes high reconstruction accuracy in
the textureless region and reduces efforts for camera pose calibration, which
is required for conventional SL-based methods. Experiment results on both
synthetic and real data demonstrate that our system outperforms conventional
DR- and SL-based methods in a high-quality surface reconstruction, particularly
for challenging objects with textureless or shiny surfaces.

runtime (which determines the circuit depth) is $\delta/\epsilon$, where
$\epsilon$ is the target precision, and the preconstant $\delta$ can be
arbitrarily close to $0$ as the initial state approaches the target eigenstate.
The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$. This is different from all previous
proposals, where $\delta \gtrsim \pi$ is required even if the initial state is
an exact eigenstate. As a result, our algorithm may significantly reduce the
circuit depth for performing phase estimation tasks on early fault-tolerant
quantum computers. The key technique is a simple subroutine called quantum
complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our algorithm can be readily applied
to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum
Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the initial state and the ground state is
large. If this initial overlap is small, we can combine our method with the
Fourier filtering method developed in [Lin, Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022],
and the resulting algorithm provably reduces the circuit depth in the presence
of a large relative overlap compared to $\epsilon$. The relative overlap
condition is similar to a spectral gap assumption, but it is aware of the
information in the initial state and is therefore applicable to certain
Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We observe that the circuit depth can be
reduced by around two orders of magnitude in numerical experiments under
various settings.

partial contribution of tensor force in the intermediate-range region and the

recognition can infer objects' category, pose, and extent. These objects can
serve as stable semantic landmarks for viewpoint-independent and non-ambiguous
loop closure. However, there is a critical object-level data association
problem due to the lack of efficient and robust algorithms.
  We introduce a novel object-level data association algorithm, which
incorporates IoU, instance-level embedding, and detection uncertainty,
formulated as a linear assignment problem. Then, we model the objects as TSDF
volumes and represent the environment as a 3D graph with semantics and
topology. Next, we propose a graph matching-based loop detection based on the
reconstructed 3D semantic graphs and correct the accumulated error by aligning
the matched objects. Finally, we refine the object poses and camera trajectory

  Experimental results show that the proposed object-level data association

attention to improve deformability, controllability, and stability. However,
for the existing stiffness soft actuator, high lateral stiffness and a wide
range of bending stiffness are hard to be provided at the same time. This paper
presents a bioinspired bidirectional stiffening soft actuator (BISA) combining
the air-tendon hybrid actuation (ATA) and a bone-like structure (BLS). The ATA
is the main actuation of the BISA, and the bending stiffness can be modulated
with a maximum stiffness of about 0.7 N/mm and a maximum magnification of 3
times when the bending angle is 45 deg. Inspired by the morphological structure
of the phalanx, the lateral stiffness can be modulated by changing the pulling
force of the BLS. The lateral stiffness can be modulated by changing the
pulling force to it. The actuator with BLSs can improve the lateral stiffness
about 3.9 times compared to the one without BLSs. The maximum lateral stiffness
can reach 0.46 N/mm. And the lateral stiffness can be modulated decoupling
about 1.3 times (e.g., from 0.35 N/mm to 0.46 when the bending angle is 45
deg). The test results show the influence of the rigid structures on bending is
small with about 1.5 mm maximum position errors of the distal point of actuator
bending in different pulling forces. The advantages brought by the proposed
method enable a soft four-finger gripper to operate in three modes: normal
grasping, inverse grasping, and horizontal lifting. The performance of this

conducted, proving the robust performance and potential application of the

existing methods utilize 2D pose annotations to help 3D pose estimation, they

from the camera, called relative depth. We collect a 2D pose dataset (MCPC) and
generate relative depth labels. Based on MCPC, we propose a weakly-supervised
pre-training (WSP) strategy to distinguish the depth relationship between two
points in an image. WSP enables the learning of the relative depth of two
keypoints on lots of in-the-wild images, which is more capable of predicting
depth and generalization ability for 3D human pose estimation. After
fine-tuning on 3D pose datasets, WSP achieves state-of-the-art results on two

nonthermal electrons and their emissions should contribute to the observed

differences detectable by current and future observational capabilities. We
introduce nonthermal electrons in a semi-analytical accretion disk, which
considers viscosity-leading heating processes, and adopt a continued hybrid
electron energy distribution of thermal distribution and power-law tail. We
generate the black hole images and extract the structural features as crescent
parameters. We find the existence of nonthermal electron radiation makes the
crescent much brighter, slightly larger, moderately thicker, and much more
symmetric. When the nonthermal connecting Lorentz factor $\gamma_c=65$, which
is equivalent to the nonthermal electrons accounting for $\sim1.5$% of the
totals, nonthermal effects cause $\sim2$% size difference at 230 GHz. Comparing
with the structural changes caused by other physical factors, including
inclination between the system and the observer, black hole spin, and

  Linearization and Zonotopes",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performing real-time receding horizon motion planning for autonomous vehicles
while providing safety guarantees remains difficult. This is because existing
methods to accurately predict ego vehicle behavior under a chosen controller
use online numerical integration that requires a fine time discretization and
thereby adversely affects real-time performance. To address this limitation,
several recent papers have proposed to apply offline reachability analysis to
conservatively predict the behavior of the ego vehicle. This reachable set can
be constructed by utilizing a simplified model whose behavior is assumed a
priori to conservatively bound the dynamics of a full-order model. However,
guaranteeing that one satisfies this assumption is challenging. This paper
proposes a framework named REFINE to overcome the limitations of these existing
approaches. REFINE utilizes a parameterized robust controller that partially
linearizes the vehicle dynamics even in the presence of modeling error.
Zonotope-based reachability analysis is then performed on the closed-loop,
full-order vehicle dynamics to compute the corresponding control-parameterized,
over-approximate Forward Reachable Sets (FRS). Because reachability analysis is
applied to the full-order model, the potential conservativeness introduced by
using a simplified model is avoided. The pre-computed, control-parameterized
FRS is then used online in an optimization framework to ensure safety. The
proposed method is compared to several state of the art methods during a
simulation-based evaluation on a full-size vehicle model and is evaluated on a
1/10th race car robot in real hardware testing. In contrast to existing
methods, REFINE is shown to enable the vehicle to safely navigate itself
through complex environments.

The recent detection of gravitational wave event GW190814 has confirmed the
existence of compact stars with masses as high as $\sim2.5-2.67M_{\odot}$
within the so-called mass gap, indicating the existence of highly massive
neutron stars. One of the primary goals to invoke massive compact objects was
to explain the recent detections of over a dozen Type Ia supernovae, whose
peculiarity lies with their unusual light curve, in particular the high
luminosity and low ejecta velocity. In a series of recent papers, our group has
proposed that highly magnetised white dwarfs with super-Chandrasekhar masses
can be promising candidates for the progenitors of these peculiar supernovae.
The mass-radius relations of these magnetised stars are significantly different
from those of their non-magnetised counterparts, which leads to a revised
super-Chandrasekhar mass-limit. These compact stars have wider ranging
implications, including those for soft gamma-ray repeaters, anomalous X-ray
pulsars, white dwarf pulsars and gravitational radiation. Here we review the
development of the subject over the last decade or so, describing the overall
state of the art of the subject as it stands now. We mainly touch upon the
possible formation channels of these intriguing stars as well as the
effectiveness of direct detection methods. These magnetised stars can have many
interesting consequences, including reconsideration of them as possible

Predictive performance is necessary but insufficient, however, with

comparisons between models (traditional versus deep) and various explainability

performance between and within traditional (XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM

a donation solicitation. The design balances two competing objectives:
optimizing the outcomes for the subjects in the experiment (``cumulative regret
minimization'') and gathering data that will be most useful for policy
learning, that is, for learning an assignment rule that will maximize welfare
if used after the experiment (``simple regret minimization''). We evaluate
alternative experimental designs by collecting pilot data and then conducting a
simulation study. Next, we implement our selected algorithm. Finally, we
perform a second simulation study anchored to the collected data that evaluates
the benefits of the algorithm we chose. Our first result is that the value of a
learned policy in this setting is higher when data is collected via a uniform
randomization rather than collected adaptively using standard cumulative regret
minimization or policy learning algorithms. We propose a simple heuristic for
adaptive experimentation that improves upon uniform randomization from the
perspective of policy learning at the expense of increasing cumulative regret
relative to alternative bandit algorithms. The heuristic modifies an existing
contextual bandit algorithm by (i) imposing a lower bound on assignment
probabilities that decay slowly so that no arm is discarded too quickly, and
(ii) after adaptively collecting data, restricting policy learning to select
from arms where sufficient data has been gathered.

imperceptible perturbations to it. Since such perturbations aim at hurting the
entire training process, they should reflect the vulnerability of DNN training,
rather than that of a single model. Based on this new idea, we seek perturbed
examples that are always unrecognized (never correctly classified) in training.
In this paper, we uncover them by model checkpoints' gradients, forming the
proposed self-ensemble protection (SEP), which is very effective because (1)
learning on examples ignored during normal training tends to yield DNNs
ignoring normal examples; (2) checkpoints' cross-model gradients are close to
orthogonal, meaning that they are as diverse as DNNs with different
architectures. That is, our amazing performance of ensemble only requires the
computation of training one model. By extensive experiments with 9 baselines on
3 datasets and 5 architectures, SEP is verified to be a new state-of-the-art,

logic $\mathcal{ALC}$ and neural models for symbol grounding; in particular, it
infuses an $\mathcal{ALC}$ knowledge base into neural models through
differentiable concept and role embeddings. We define a hierarchical loss to
the constraint that the grounding learned by neural models must be semantically
consistent with $\mathcal{ALC}$ knowledge bases. And we find that capturing the
semantics in grounding solely by maximizing satisfiability cannot revise
grounding rationally. We further define a rule-based loss for DF adapting to
symbol grounding problems. The experiment results show that DF-$\mathcal{ALC}$
with rule-based loss can improve the performance of image object detectors in
an unsupervised learning way, even in low-resource situations.

solve one of these problems by segmenting ball deliveries in a cricket
broadcast using deep learning models, MobileNet and YOLO, thus enabling

our research can be used by cricket coaches and players to analyze ball
deliveries which are played during the match. This paper presents an approach
to segment and extract video shots in which only the ball is being delivered.
The video shots are a series of continuous frames that make up the whole scene
of the video. Object detection models are applied to reach a high level of
accuracy in terms of correctly extracting video shots. The proof of concept for
building large datasets of video shots for ball deliveries is proposed which
paves the way for further processing on those shots for the extraction of
semantics. Ball tracking in these video shots is also done using a separate
RetinaNet model as a sample of the usefulness of the proposed dataset. The
position on the cricket pitch where the ball lands is also extracted by
tracking the ball along the y-axis. The video shot is then classified as a
full-pitched, good-length or short-pitched delivery.

dependence of the PVED of H$_2X_2$ in excited states is studied. If the
contribution from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the PVED in
the ground state is larger than the sum of those from all occupied orbitals,
the PVED in the first excited state has a much larger value compared to the

This enhancement is named cancellation breaking enhancement. The PVED
enhancement is also studied for CHFClBr, CHFClI, and CHFBrI in excited states,

real-world systems is a fundamental step in promoting interpretability of, and

cause effect identification (VCEI) framework for causal discovery in bivariate
systems from a single observational setting. Our framework relies on the
principle of independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) under the assumption of
an existing acyclic causal link, and offers a practical realization of this
principle. Principally, we artificially construct two settings in which the
marginal distributions of one covariate, claimed to be the cause, are
guaranteed to have non-negligible variations. This is achieved by re-weighting
samples of the marginal so that the resultant distribution is notably distinct
from this marginal according to some discrepancy measure. In the causal
direction, such variations are expected to have no impact on the effect
generation mechanism. Therefore, quantifying the impact of these variations on
the conditionals reveals the genuine causal direction. Moreover, we formulate
our approach in the kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy, lifting all
constraints on the data types of cause-and-effect covariates, and rendering
such artificial interventions a convex optimization problem. We provide a
series of experiments on real and synthetic data showing that VCEI is, in

breakup of a Newtonian droplet under impulsive acceleration. A Buckingham-Pi
analysis reveals that the critical Weber number $\mathit{We}_\mathit{cr}$ for a
non-vibrational breakup depends on the density ratio $(\rho)$, the drop
$(\mathit{Oh}_d)$ and the ambient $(\mathit{Oh}_o)$ Ohnesorge numbers. Volume
of fluid (VOF) multiphase flow simulations are performed using Basilisk to
conduct a reasonably complete parametric sweep of the non-dimensional
parameters involved. It is found that, contrary to current consensus, even for
$\mathit{Oh}_d \leq 0.1$, a decrease in $\mathit{Oh}_d$ has a substantial
impact on the breakup morphology, motivating plume formation. In addition to
$\rho$, $\mathit{Oh}_o$ also affects the balance between pressure differences
between a droplet's pole and its periphery, and the shear stresses on its
upstream surface, which ultimately dictates the flow inside the droplet. This
behavior manifests in simulations through the observed pancake shapes and
ultimately the breakup morphology (forward or backward bag). All these factors
affecting droplet deformation process are specified and theories explaining the
observed results are provided. A $\mathit{We}_\mathit{cr}-\mathit{Oh}_d$ plot

approach, Level-S$^2$fM, which estimates the camera poses and scene geometry

Our novel formulation poses some new challenges due to inevitable two-view and
few-view configurations in the incremental SfM pipeline, which complicates the
optimization of coordinate MLPs for volumetric neural rendering with unknown
camera poses. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the strong inductive basis
conveying in the 2D correspondences is promising to tackle those challenges by
exploiting the relationship between the ray sampling schemes. Based on this, we
revisit the pipeline of incremental SfM and renew the key components, including
two-view geometry initialization, the camera poses registration, the 3D points
triangulation, and Bundle Adjustment, with a fresh perspective based on neural
implicit surfaces. By unifying the scene geometry in small MLP networks through
coordinate MLPs, our Level-S$^2$fM treats the zero-level set of the implicit
surface as an informative top-down regularization to manage the reconstructed
3D points, reject the outliers in correspondences via querying SDF, and refine
the estimated geometries by NBA (Neural BA). Not only does our Level-S$^2$fM
lead to promising results on camera pose estimation and scene geometry

Our results demonstrate that the droplet contact line dynamics resulting from
the presence of various nanoparticles plays a dominant role in the evaporation
process. This is in contrast to the widely-held assumption that the enhanced
evaporation rate observed in sessile nanofluid droplets is due to the higher
thermal conductivity of the added nanoparticles. We observe that even though
the thermal conductivity of Al$_2$O$_3$ is an order of magnitude lower than
that of Cu, droplets containing 25 nm-sized Al$_2$O$_3$ exhibit pinned contact
line dynamics and evaporate much more rapidly than droplets containing Cu
nanoparticles of both sizes and 75 nm Al$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles that exhibit
stick-slip behaviour. We also found that the droplets with different

contact line behaviour, which alters the heat transfer inside the droplets. We
establish this counter-intuitive observation by analysing the temporal

systems of motile particles with alignment interactions through extensive
numerical simulations of the incompressible Toner-Tu (ITT) field theory and a
detailed finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis. The transition looks continuous in
the explored parameter space, but the effective susceptibility exponent
$\gamma/\nu$ and the dynamic exponent $z$ exhibit a strong, non-monotonic
variation on the system size in the form of double crossovers. At small sizes,
mean-field exponents are observed for the homogeneous $k=0$ mode whereas
spatial fluctuations follow Gaussian statistics. A first crossover marks the
departure from this regime to one where the system behaves like the equilibrium
XY model with long-ranged dipolar interaction and vortex excitations. At larger
sizes, scaling deviates from the dipolar XY behavior and a second crossover is
observed, to presumably the asymptotic ITT universality class. At this
crossover to genuinely off-equilibrium behavior, advection comes in to expedite
transport of fluctuations, suppress large-scale fluctuations and help stabilize
long-range order. We obtain estimates and bounds of the universal Binder
cumulant and exponents of the ITT class. We propose a reduced hydrodynamic
theory, previously overlooked, that quantitatively describes the first scaling
regime. By providing a relatively comprehensive numerical picture and a novel
analytical description, our results help elucidate finite-size effects in
critical active matter systems, which have been argued to be relevant for
understanding scale-free behavior in real flocks or swarms.

Interestingly, the activity of FRB 180916 shows a well-regulated behavior, with
a period of 16.35 days. The bursts are found to occur in a duty circle of about
5 days in each period. In this study, we suggest that the bursts of FRB 180916
are produced by a strange star interacting with its planet. The planet moves in
a highly eccentric orbit around its compact host, with the periastron only
slightly beyond the tidal disruption radius. As a result, the planet will be
partially disrupted every time it passes through the periastron. The stripped
material from the planet will be accreted by the strange star, falling to the
polar cap region along the magnetic field lines and accumulated there. It will
finally lead to a local collapse when the crust at the polar region is
overloaded, triggering an FRB. The observed 16.35 day period corresponds to the
orbital motion of the planet, and the 5 day duty circle is explained as the
duration of the partial disruption near the periastron. The energy released in
each local collapse event can be as high as $\sim 10^{42}~\rm {erg}$, which is
large enough to account for typical FRBs even if the radiation efficiency is
extremely low.

bounded from below. While the $\beta=0$ case has been much well studied, the
motivation behind taking such a hybrid potential corresponds to the fact that
it might generate finite negative vacuum expectation values of $V(\phi)$ as
well of $\phi$, leading to some dynamical screening of the inflationary
cosmological constant $\Lambda$, at late times, with the initial conditions,
$\langle \phi \rangle=0=\langle V(\phi) \rangle $. In this work we first
compute the vacuum expectation values of $\phi,\, \phi^2$ and $V(\phi)$, using
the late time, non-perturbative and infrared effective stochastic formalism.
The backreactions to the inflationary $\Lambda$ are estimated. We also compute
the dynamically generated mass of the scalar field using $\langle \phi^2

with respect to the initial Bunch-Davies vacuum at one and two loops, using the
Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. These results show non-perturbative secular
logarithms, growing with the cosmological time. Using next a recently proposed
renormalisation group inspired formalism, we attempt to find out a resummed
$\langle\phi^2\rangle$. We have been able to resum some part of the same which
contains contributions only from the local self energy. The corresponding
dynamically generated mass is computed. Comparison of the stochastic and the
quantum field theory results shows that they differ numerically, although they
have similar qualitative behaviour. Possible reasons for such quantitative
mismatch is discussed. The manifestation of strong non-classical effects in the
results found via both the formalisms has been emphasised.

helps people to order what you want. Compared with traditional e-commerce
recommendation systems, users' interests may be diverse under different
spatiotemporal contexts, leading to various spatiotemporal data distribution,
which limits the fitting capacity of the model. However, numerous current works
simply mix all samples to train a set of model parameters, which makes it
difficult to capture the diversity in different spatiotemporal contexts.
Therefore, we address this challenge by proposing a Bottom-up Adaptive
Spatiotemporal Model(BASM) to adaptively fit the spatiotemporal data
distribution, which further improve the fitting capability of the model.
Specifically, a spatiotemporal-aware embedding layer performs weight adaptation
on field granularity in feature embedding, to achieve the purpose of
dynamically perceiving spatiotemporal contexts. Meanwhile, we propose a
spatiotemporal semantic transformation layer to explicitly convert the
concatenated input of the raw semantic to spatiotemporal semantic, which can
further enhance the semantic representation under different spatiotemporal
contexts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel spatiotemporal adaptive bias tower
to capture diverse spatiotemporal bias, reducing the difficulty to model
spatiotemporal distinction. To further verify the effectiveness of BASM, we
also novelly propose two new metrics, Time-period-wise AUC (TAUC) and City-wise
AUC (CAUC). Extensive offline evaluations on public and industrial datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modle. The online
A/B experiment also further illustrates the practicability of the model online

trade-offs between multiple objectives, including limits on urban build-up

to urban planners to have a fast surrogate model to predict urban
characteristics of a hypothetical layout, e.g. pedestrian-level wind velocity,
without having to run computationally expensive and time-consuming
high-fidelity numerical simulations. This fast surrogate can then be
potentially integrated into other design optimization frameworks, including
generative models or other gradient-based methods. Here we present the use of

ground state of baryonic matter at low pressure. We find that the interplay
between the hadronic matter and quark matter compositions of CrSs can help to
reconcile the small radii constraints indicated by the LIGO/Virgo GW170817
event, the large radii constraints set for massive compact stars by recent
NICER X-ray observations, and the recent observation of the most-massive pulsar
PSR J0952-0607. This leaves more space open for the equation of states of both
hadronic matter and quark matter.

companies and organizations have begun to outsource the training process.
However, the externally trained DNNs can potentially be backdoor attacked. It
is crucial to defend against such attacks, i.e., to postprocess a suspicious
model so that its backdoor behavior is mitigated while its normal prediction
power on clean inputs remain uncompromised. To remove the abnormal backdoor
behavior, existing methods mostly rely on additional labeled clean samples.
However, such requirement may be unrealistic as the training data are often
unavailable to end users. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of
circumventing such barrier. We propose a novel defense method that does not
require training labels. Through a carefully designed layer-wise weight
re-initialization and knowledge distillation, our method can effectively
cleanse backdoor behaviors of a suspicious network with negligible compromise
in its normal behavior. In experiments, we show that our method, trained
without labels, is on-par with state-of-the-art defense methods trained using
labels. We also observe promising defense results even on out-of-distribution
data. This makes our method very practical. Code is available at:

rotor robots with icosahedron tensegrity structures. The tensegrity aerial
vehicles can withstand high-speed impacts and resume operation after
collisions. To guide the design process of these aerial vehicles, we propose a
model-based methodology that predicts the stresses in the structure with a
dynamics simulation and selects components that can withstand the predicted
stresses. Meanwhile, an autonomous re-orientation controller is created to help
the tensegrity aerial vehicles resume flight after collisions. The
re-orientation controller can rotate the vehicles from arbitrary orientations
on the ground to ones easy for takeoff. With collision resilience and
re-orientation ability, the tensegrity aerial vehicles can operate in cluttered
environments without complex collision-avoidance strategies. Moreover, by
adopting an inertial navigation strategy of replacing flight with short hops to
mitigate the growth of state estimation error, the tensegrity aerial vehicles
can conduct short-range operations without external sensors. These capabilities
are validated by a test of an experimental tensegrity aerial vehicle operating
with only onboard inertial sensors in a previously-unknown forest.

been demonstrated under strictly controlled settings, with little attention
paid to less ideal scenarios, including with the presence of noise such as
exposure, illumination changes, and blur. In particular, though blur frequently
occurs in real situations, NeRF that can handle blurred images has received
little attention. The few studies that have investigated NeRF for blurred
images have not considered geometric and appearance consistency in 3D space,
which is one of the most important factors in 3D reconstruction. This leads to
inconsistency and the degradation of the perceptual quality of the constructed
scene. Hence, this paper proposes a DP-NeRF, a novel clean NeRF framework for
blurred images, which is constrained with two physical priors. These priors are
derived from the actual blurring process during image acquisition by the
camera. DP-NeRF proposes rigid blurring kernel to impose 3D consistency
utilizing the physical priors and adaptive weight proposal to refine the color
composition error in consideration of the relationship between depth and blur.
We present extensive experimental results for synthetic and real scenes with
two types of blur: camera motion blur and defocus blur. The results demonstrate
that DP-NeRF successfully improves the perceptual quality of the constructed
NeRF ensuring 3D geometric and appearance consistency. We further demonstrate
the effectiveness of our model with comprehensive ablation analysis.

collaborative training without compromising data privacy, Federated Learning
(FL) has been increasingly used in AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things)
design. However, due to the lack of efficient management of straggling devices,
existing FL methods greatly suffer from the problems of low inference accuracy
and long training time. Things become even worse when taking various uncertain
factors (e.g., network delays, performance variances caused by process
variation) existing in AIoT scenarios into account. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a novel asynchronous FL framework named GitFL, whose
implementation is inspired by the famous version control system Git. Unlike
traditional FL, the cloud server of GitFL maintains a master model (i.e., the
global model) together with a set of branch models indicating the trained local
models committed by selected devices, where the master model is updated based
on both all the pushed branch models and their version information, and only
the branch models after the pull operation are dispatched to devices. By using
our proposed Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based device selection mechanism, a
pulled branch model with an older version will be more likely to be dispatched
to a faster and less frequently selected device for the next round of local
training. In this way, GitFL enables both effective control of model staleness
and adaptive load balance of versioned models among straggling devices, thus
avoiding the performance deterioration. Comprehensive experimental results on
well-known models and datasets show that, compared with state-of-the-art
asynchronous FL methods, GitFL can achieve up to 2.64X training acceleration
and 7.88% inference accuracy improvements in various uncertain scenarios.

setting, where processes can freely join and leave. In such a setting, to
safeguard against Sybil attacks, correct processes rely on cryptographic proofs
tied to a particular type of resource to make them eligible to order
transactions. For example, in the case of Proof-of-Work (PoW), this resource is
computation, and the proof is a solution to a computationally hard puzzle.
Conversely, in Proof-of-Stake (PoS), the resource corresponds to the number of
coins that every process in the system owns, and a secure lottery selects a
process for participation proportionally to its coin holdings.
  Although many resource-based blockchain protocols are formally proven secure
in the literature, the existing security proofs fail to demonstrate why
particular types of resources cause the blockchain protocols to be vulnerable
to distinct classes of attacks. For instance, PoS systems are more vulnerable
to long-range attacks, where an adversary corrupts past processes to re-write
the history, than Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Storage systems.
Proof-of-Storage-based and Proof-of-Stake-based protocols are both more
susceptible to private double-spending attacks than Proof-of-Work-based
protocols; in this case, an adversary mines its chain in secret without sharing
its blocks with the rest of the processes until the end of the attack.
  In this paper, we formally characterize the properties of resources through
an abstraction called resource allocator and give a framework for understanding
longest-chain consensus protocols based on different underlying resources. In
addition, we use this resource allocator to demonstrate security trade-offs
between various resources focusing on well-known attacks (e.g., the long-range
attack and nothing-at-stake attacks).

receptive field size and reduce computational costs. This practice, however,
also leads to the loss of high-frequency information and fails to consider
within-scale characteristics. Recently, dynamic convolution has exhibited
powerful capabilities in processing high-frequency information (e.g., edges,
corners, textures), but previous works lack sufficient spatial contextual
information in filter generation. To alleviate these issues, we propose to
employ dynamic convolution to improve the learning of high-frequency and
multi-scale features. Specifically, we design a spatially enhanced kernel
generation (SEKG) module to improve dynamic convolution, enabling the learning
of spatial context information with a very low computational complexity. Based
on the SEKG module, we propose a dynamic convolution block (DCB) and a
multi-scale dynamic convolution block (MDCB). The former enhances the
high-frequency information via dynamic convolution and preserves low-frequency
information via skip connections. The latter utilizes shared adaptive dynamic
kernels and the idea of dilated convolution to achieve efficient multi-scale
feature extraction. The proposed multi-dimension feature integration (MFI)
mechanism further fuses the multi-scale features, providing precise and
contextually enriched feature representations. Finally, we build an efficient
denoising network with the proposed DCB and MDCB, named ADFNet. It achieves
better performance with low computational complexity on real-world and

that we can correct to NNLO for finite-volume, pion-mass mistuning and

perturbation theory, emphasizing that it provides a systematic EFT approach to
the HVP contribution, but not to short- or intermediate-distance window

considering systematic uncertainties, at a mass of

the data set is limited in size, the upper limits are evaluated at the 90\%
confidence level on the product of the Born cross sections
($\sigma^{\mathrm{Born}}$) and the branching fraction ($\mathcal{B}$) of
$Z_{cs}^{\prime-}\rightarrow D_{s}^{*-}D^{* 0}$, under different assumptions of

$\mathcal{O}(1)$ pb at each energy. Larger data samples are needed to confirm
the $Z_{cs}^{\prime -}$ state and clarify its nature in the coming years.

expanding population is a persistent financial challenge for many of the
rapidly expanding cities in developing nations like Ethiopia. The land lease
system has received little academic attention as a means of financing urban
infrastructure in developing countries. Therefore, the main objective of this
study is to assess the contribution of land leasing in financing urban
infrastructure and services using evidence from Bahir Dar city, Ethiopia.
Primary and secondary data-gathering techniques have been used. Descriptive
statistics and qualitative analysis have been adopted. The results show land
lease revenue is a dominant source of extra-budgetary revenue for Bahir Dar
city. As evidenced by Bahir Dar city, a significant portion of urban
infrastructure expenditure is financed by revenues from land leasing. However,
despite the critical importance of land lease revenue to investments in urban
infrastructure, there is inefficiency in the collection of potential lease
revenue due to weak information exchange, inadequate land provision for various
uses, lack of transparency in tender committees, and the existence of poor
documentation. Our findings suggest that Bahir Dar City needs to manage lease
revenue more effectively to increase investment in urban infrastructure while
giving due consideration to availing more land for leasing.

exist only for sufficiently large masses if the interaction is repulsive. In
the latter case, if the power is less or equal to four, ground states coincide
with the only bound state. If instead, the power is greater than four, then
there are values of the mass for which two bound states exist, and neither of
the two is a ground state, and values of the mass for which two bound states

accounting across multiple data accesses from per-access privacy bounds.
However they often result in weaker bounds compared with end-to-end analysis.
Two popular tools that mitigate that are the exponential mechanism (or report
noisy max) and the sparse vector technique. They were generalized in a couple
of recent private selection/test frameworks, including the work by Liu and
Talwar (STOC 2019), and Papernot and Steinke (ICLR 2022).
  In this work, we first present an alternative framework for private selection
and testing with a simpler privacy proof and equally-good utility guarantee.
Second, we observe that the private selection framework (both previous ones and
ours) can be applied to improve the accuracy/confidence trade-off for many
fundamental privacy-preserving data-analysis tasks, including query releasing,
top-$k$ selection, and stable selection.
  Finally, for online settings, we apply the private testing to design a
mechanism for adaptive query releasing, which improves the sample complexity
dependence on the confidence parameter for the celebrated private
multiplicative weights algorithm of Hardt and Rothblum (FOCS 2010).

and the causal wedges, their existence encodes deep aspects of the entanglement
wedge reconstruction in the context of subregion duality in AdS/CFT. In this
paper, we study the perturbation theory of the causal shadows and their
relation to the properties of the associated modular flows. We first revisit
the cases of degenerate causal shadows based on known examples, and discuss the
origin for their degeneracy via the local nature of the modular flow. We then
focus on the perturbative case in which the CFT subregion consists of two
spheres separated by a large distance $L\gg R_{1,2}$. The RT surfaces still
agree with the causal horizons, giving a degenerate causal shadow classically.
We compute the corrections to the quantum extremal surfaces (Q.E.S) from the
bulk mutual information, which then give rise to a non-degenerate causal shadow
at order $G_N$. We end by discussing the causal shadow perturbation theory more
generally, in particular we explore the possibility of extracting the
positivity conditions characterizing perturbative causal shadows in the
boundary CFTs.

natural phenomena such as sounds, earthquakes, ionospheric and brain activity,
and various emissions from cosmic objects is extremely difficult. As a method
for finding periodicity in such challenging data sets, the 2D Hybrid approach,
which employs wavelets, is presented. Our technique produces a wavelet
transform correlation intensity contour map for two (or one) time series on a
period plane defined by two independent period axes. Notably, by spreading
peaks across the second dimension, our method improves apparent resolution of
detected oscillations in the period plane and identifies the direction of
signal changes using correlation coefficients. We demonstrate the performance
of the 2D Hybrid technique on a very low frequency (VLF) signal emitted in
Italy and recorded in Serbia in time vicinity of the occurrence of an
earthquake on November 3, 2010, near Kraljevo, Serbia. We identified a distinct
signal in the range 120-130 s that appears only in association with the
considered earthquake. Other wavelets, such as Superlets, which may detect fast
transient oscillations, will be employed in the future analysis.

detailed discussion on the SS generation at gNB but a limited understanding of
their blind search, and detection is available. Unlike 4G, 5G SS may not be
transmitted at the center of carrier frequency and their frequency location is
unknown to UE. In this work, we demonstrate the 5G CS by designing 3GPP
compatible hardware realization of the physical layer (PHY) of the gNB

down-sampling approach resulting in a significant reduction in complexity and
latency. Via detailed performance analysis, we analyze the functional
correctness, computational complexity, and latency of the proposed approach for
different word lengths, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and down-sampling factors.

ill-posed inverse problem. In these proceedings we report on a recent approach
that instead utilises the non-perturbative constraints imposed by field
locality to extract spectral function information directly from spatial
correlators. In particular, we focus on the application of this approach to
lattice QCD data of the spatial pseudo-scalar meson correlator in the
temperature range $220-960 \, \text{MeV}$, and outline why this data supports
the conclusion that there exists a distinct pion state above the chiral
pseudo-critical temperature $T_{\!\text{pc}}$.

multi-agent reinforcement learning methods with linear value decomposition

overgeneralization. As a result, they can not ensure optimal consistency (i.e.,
the correspondence between individual greedy actions and the maximal true Q

of LVD and MVD. According to the expression, we draw a transition diagram,
where each self-transition node (STN) is a possible convergence. To ensure
optimal consistency, the optimal node is required to be the unique STN.
Therefore, we propose the greedy-based value representation (GVR), which turns
the optimal node into an STN via inferior target shaping and further eliminates
the non-optimal STNs via superior experience replay. In addition, GVR achieves
an adaptive trade-off between optimality and stability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in experiments on various benchmarks. Theoretical
proofs and empirical results on matrix games demonstrate that GVR ensures

overprovisioning leads to high resource wastage, underprovisioning can result
in long runtimes or even failed tasks.
  In this paper, we propose two different reinforcement learning approaches

prototypical implementation in the well-known scientific workflow management

However, existing DG methods can hardly achieve effective disentanglement to
get high generalizability. To deal with this problem, we propose an efficient
Contrastive Domain Disentanglement and Style Augmentation (CDDSA) framework for
generalizable medical image segmentation. First, a disentangle network is
proposed to decompose an image into a domain-invariant anatomical
representation and a domain-specific style code, where the former is sent to a
segmentation model that is not affected by the domain shift, and the
disentangle network is regularized by a decoder that combines the anatomical
and style codes to reconstruct the input image. Second, to achieve better
disentanglement, a contrastive loss is proposed to encourage the style codes
from the same domain and different domains to be compact and divergent,
respectively. Thirdly, to further improve generalizability, we propose a style
augmentation method based on the disentanglement representation to synthesize
images in various unseen styles with shared anatomical structures. Our method
was validated on a public multi-site fundus image dataset for optic cup and
disc segmentation and an in-house multi-site Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Magnetic

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more readily accessible and
does not involve ionizing radiation. This study presents a convolutional
encoder-decoder network with attention mechanisms to predict gold-standard
15O-water PET CBF from multi-sequence MRI scans, thereby eliminating the need
for radioactive tracers. Inputs to the prediction model include several
commonly used MRI sequences (T1-weighted, T2-FLAIR, and arterial spin

a group of 126 subjects consisting of healthy controls and cerebrovascular
disease patients, all of whom underwent simultaneous $15O-water PET/MRI. The
results show that such a model can successfully synthesize high-quality PET CBF
measurements (with an average SSIM of 0.924 and PSNR of 38.8 dB) and is more

demonstrate the clinical significance of the proposed algorithm by evaluating
the agreement for identifying the vascular territories with abnormally low CBF.
Such methods may enable more widespread and accurate CBF evaluation in larger

the invasion of the new virus variant Omicron BA.1. After that, side waves were
formed by the coupling of the invasion of the new virus variant Omicron BA.2

simple analytical solution based on the Boltzmann transport equation is also
presented (together with the solution using Chapman-Enskog (CE) method) using
which various transport coefficients are obtained. The central idea of our
approach is the realization that, in polydisperse system, the collision
scattering cross section is proportional to a random variable \textit{z} which
is equal to the sum of two random variables $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_j$
(representing particle diameters), and the distribution of \textit{z} can be
written as the convolution of the two distributions $P(\sigma_i)$ and
$P(\sigma_j)$. The obtained transport coefficients are expressed as explicit
function of polydispersity index, $\delta$, and their dependence on the nature
of particle size distribution is explored. It is observed that in the low
polydispersity limit, the transport coefficients are found to be insensitive to
the type of size distribution functions considered. The analytical results (for
diffusion coefficients and thermal conductivity) obtained using Chapman-Enskog
method and our simple analytical approach agrees well with the simulation.
However, for shear viscosity, our analyical approach agress for $\delta \le
20\%$, while it agrees upto $\delta \approx 40\%$ with the result obtained

effect of scaling mass (i.e., mass proportional to the particle size and thus a

connect to each other in multiple ways, for example friend, family, and

network analysis allowing us to forecast the future status of a network: which
new connections are the most likely to appear in the future? In multiplex link
prediction we also ask: of which type? Because this last question is
unanswerable with classical link prediction, here we investigate the use of
graph association rules to inform multiplex link prediction. We derive such
rules by identifying all frequent patterns in a network via multiplex graph
mining, and then score each unobserved link's likelihood by finding the
occurrences of each rule in the original network. Association rules add new
abilities to multiplex link prediction: to predict new node arrivals, to
consider higher order structures with four or more nodes, and to be memory
efficient. We improve over previous work by creating a framework that is also
efficient in terms of runtime, which enables an increase in prediction
performance. This increase in efficiency allows us to improve a case study on a
signed multiplex network, showing how graph association rules can provide
valuable insights to extend social balance theory.

conceptual revolution has started. However, since Einstein's relativistic
theories and the subsequent advent of quantum mechanics, physicists and
philosophers have taken different paths, both kidnapped by the intrinsic
conceptual and mathematical difficulties inherited by their studies. Is it
possible to restore a unitary vision of knowledge, overcoming the
scientific-humanistic dichotomy that has established itself over time? The
answer is certainly not trivial, but we can start from school to experience a
new vision of a unified knowledge. From this need, the Gravitas project has
born. Gravitas is a multidisciplinary outreach and educational program devoted
to high school students (17-19 years old) that mixes contemporary physics and
the philosophy of science. Coordinated by the Cagliari Section of the National
Institute of Nuclear Physics, in Italy, Gravitas has started on December 2021
with an unconventional online format: two researchers coming from different
fields of research meet a moderator and informally discuss about gravity and
related phenomena. The public can chat and indirectly interact with them during
the YouTube live. The project involved about 250 students from 16 high schools
in Sardinia, Italy. Students should also create posts thought for social media

present the project and discuss its possible outcomings concerning the

the number of occurrences of temporal motifs is a fundamental problem for
temporal network analysis. However, existing methods either cannot support
temporal motifs or suffer from performance issues. Moreover, they cannot work
in the streaming model where edges are observed incrementally over time. In
this paper, we focus on approximate temporal motif counting via random
sampling. We first propose two sampling algorithms for temporal motif counting
in the offline setting. The first is an edge sampling (ES) algorithm for
estimating the number of instances of any temporal motif. The second is an
improved edge-wedge sampling (EWS) algorithm that hybridizes edge sampling with
wedge sampling for counting temporal motifs with $3$ vertices and $3$ edges.
Furthermore, we propose two algorithms to count temporal motifs incrementally

SES and SEWS. We provide comprehensive analyses of the theoretical bounds and

better accuracy, and greater scalability than state-of-the-art sampling methods

achieve up to three orders of magnitude speedups over ES and EWS while having

effectiveness of the proposed method, subject-independent experiments are

outstanding performance, and the accuracies of arousal and valence

the computation and memory boost significantly with the increase of domains. To
reduce computational complexity, manually grouping domains with particular
business strategies is common in industrial applications. However, this
pre-defined data partitioning way heavily relies on prior knowledge, and it may
neglect the underlying data distribution of each domain, hence limiting the
model's representation capability. Regarding the above issues, we propose an
elegant and flexible multi-distribution modeling paradigm, named Adaptive
Distribution Hierarchical Model (AdaptDHM), which is an end-to-end optimization
hierarchical structure consisting of a clustering process and classification
process. Specifically, we design a distribution adaptation module with a
customized dynamic routing mechanism. Instead of introducing prior knowledge
for pre-defined data allocation, this routing algorithm adaptively provides a
distribution coefficient for each sample to determine which cluster it belongs
to. Each cluster corresponds to a particular distribution so that the model can
sufficiently capture the commonalities and distinctions between these distinct
clusters. Extensive experiments on both public and large-scale Alibaba
industrial datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of AdaptDHM: Our
model achieves impressive prediction accuracy and its time cost during the
training stage is more than 50% less than that of other models.

cross section has been studied for $^9$Be projectile incident on $^{169}$Tm,
$^{181}$Ta, $^{187}$Re and $^{197}$Au targets around Coulomb barrier energy.
The measured one neutron stripping cross sections for these systems have been
compared with the coupled channel calculations. The recently developed global
set of optical model potential parameters for $^9$Be projectile has been used
in the present calculations. The cumulative of measured complete fusion (CF),
incomplete fusion (ICF), one neutron stripping and calculated non-capture
breakup (NCBU) cross sections is found to explain almost the reaction cross
sections for all the targets. A very small contribution from target inelastic
states and elastic breakup may contribute to the remaining part. The percentage
fraction of cross section for CF, ICF, one neutron stripping, and NCBU over
reaction cross section show the dominance of neutron transfer and NCBU at below
barrier energies while CF and ICF processes have the major contribution at
above barrier energies.

action and a payoff-dominant one. The network plasticity is measured by the
probability to rewire links. Changing this plasticity parameter, there is a
transition from a regime in which the system fully coordinates in a single
connected component to a regime in which the system fragments in two connected
components, each one coordinated on a different action (either if both actions
are equivalent or not). The nature of this fragmentation transition is
different for different update rules. Second, we find that both for RD and UI
in a GCG, there is a regime of intermediate values of plasticity, before the
fragmentation transition, for which the system is able to fully coordinate in a
single component network on the payoff-dominant action, i. e., coevolution
enhances payoff-dominant equilibrium selection for both update rules.

progress with the development of deep convolutional networks over the past
years. While their performance is often jeopardized by the inaccuracy of flow
map estimation, especially in the case of large motion and occlusion. In this
paper, we propose a flow guidance deformable compensation network (FGDCN) to
overcome the drawbacks of existing motion-based methods. FGDCN decomposes the
frame sampling process into two steps: a flow step and a deformation step.
Specifically, the flow step utilizes a coarse-to-fine flow estimation network
to directly estimate the intermediate flows and synthesizes an anchor frame
simultaneously. To ensure the accuracy of the estimated flow, a distillation
loss and a task-oriented loss are jointly employed in this step. Under the
guidance of the flow priors learned in step one, the deformation step designs a
pyramid deformable compensation network to compensate for the missing details
of the flow step. In addition, a pyramid loss is proposed to supervise the
model in both the image and frequency domain. Experimental results show that
the proposed algorithm achieves excellent performance on various datasets with
fewer parameters.

high-quality images for low-quality inputs. Therefore, recent works are
directed toward leveraging the supervision of paired high-quality and
low-quality images for inversion. However, these methods are infeasible in
real-world scenarios and further hinder performance improvement. In this paper,
we resolve this problem by introducing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
into the Inversion process, namely UDA-Inversion, for both high-quality and
low-quality image inversion and editing. Particularly, UDA-Inversion first
regards the high-quality and low-quality images as the source domain and
unlabeled target domain, respectively. Then, a discrepancy function is
presented to measure the difference between two domains, after which we
minimize the source error and the discrepancy between the distributions of two
domains in the latent space to obtain accurate latent codes for low-quality
images. Without direct supervision, constructive representations of
high-quality images can be spontaneously learned and transformed into
low-quality images based on unsupervised domain adaptation. Experimental
results indicate that UDA-inversion is the first that achieves a comparable
level of performance with supervised methods in low-quality images across
multiple domain datasets. We hope this work provides a unique inspiration for
latent embedding distributions in image process tasks.

the multifractal analysis (MA) for the mass configuration of the dried pattern,
we numerically show that, the mass-fractal dimension is $1.76\pm 0.04$ for the

the fact that the droplet becomes more hydrophilic, resulting in more sparse

The role of the ligand molecule in these QD heterostructures is poorly
understood. In this study, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) is
employed in order to explore how the ligand affect the charge transfer at the
ultra-fast timescale. We study the charge transfer dynamics in CdS-MoS2
heterostructures both with and without an organic linker molecule. We find that
the ligand molecule enhances the ultrafast charge transfer, and that electrons
are preferentially transferred from CdS to MoS2 as band alignment would
predict. The electronic dynamics and time-evolved projection character are
sensitive to the ionic temperature and excitation density.

an availability point is often represented by a ''temporal edge'' that can be
traversed from its tail only at a specific departure time, for arriving in its
head after a specific travel time. In such a graph, the connectivity from one
node to another is naturally captured by the existence of a temporal path where
temporal edges can be traversed one after the other. When imposing constraints
on how much time it is possible to wait at a node in-between two temporal
edges, it then becomes interesting to consider temporal walks where it is
allowed to visit several times the same node, possibly at different times. We
study the complexity of computing minimum-cost temporal walks from a single
source under waiting-time constraints in a temporal graph, and ask under which
conditions this problem can be solved in linear time. Our main result is a
linear time algorithm when the input temporal graph is given by its (classical)
space-time representation. We use an algebraic framework for manipulating
abstract costs, enabling the optimization of a large variety of criteria or
even combinations of these. It allows to improve previous results for several
criteria such as number of edges or overall waiting time even without waiting
constraints. It saves a logarithmic factor for all criteria under waiting

complexity appears to be necessary with a more basic input consisting of a

Since aerial images are globally available at low cost, they represent a
potential compromise between two established paradigms of autonomous driving,
i.e. using expensive high-definition prior maps or relying entirely on the
sensor data captured at runtime.
  We present an end-to-end differentiable model that uses the ground and aerial
images to predict a probability distribution over possible vehicle poses. We
combine multiple vehicle datasets with aerial images from orthophoto providers
on which we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Since the ground truth
poses are often inaccurate w.r.t. the aerial images, we implement a
pseudo-label approach to produce more accurate ground truth poses and make them
publicly available.
  While previous works require training data from the target region to achieve
reasonable localization accuracy (i.e. same-area evaluation), our approach
overcomes this limitation and outperforms previous results even in the strictly
more challenging cross-area case. We improve the previous state-of-the-art by a
large margin even without ground or aerial data from the test region, which
highlights the model's potential for global-scale application. We further
integrate the uncertainty-aware predictions in a tracking framework to
determine the vehicle's trajectory over time resulting in a mean position error

pairs. However, for many targeted languages, sufficient paired data are not
available. To this end, we introduce the unpaired video captioning task aiming
to train models without coupled video-caption pairs in target language. To
solve the task, a natural choice is to employ a two-step pipeline system: first
utilizing video-to-pivot captioning model to generate captions in pivot
language and then utilizing pivot-to-target translation model to translate the
pivot captions to the target language. However, in such a pipeline system, 1)
visual information cannot reach the translation model, generating visual
irrelevant target captions; 2) the errors in the generated pivot captions will
be propagated to the translation model, resulting in disfluent target captions.
To address these problems, we propose the Unpaired Video Captioning with Visual
Injection system (UVC-VI). UVC-VI first introduces the Visual Injection Module
(VIM), which aligns source visual and target language domains to inject the
source visual information into the target language domain. Meanwhile, VIM
directly connects the encoder of the video-to-pivot model and the decoder of
the pivot-to-target model, allowing end-to-end inference by completely skipping
the generation of pivot captions. To enhance the cross-modality injection of
the VIM, UVC-VI further introduces a pluggable video encoder, i.e., Multimodal
Collaborative Encoder (MCE). The experiments show that UVC-VI outperforms
pipeline systems and exceeds several supervised systems. Furthermore, equipping
existing supervised systems with our MCE can achieve 4% and 7% relative margins
on the CIDEr scores to current state-of-the-art models on the benchmark MSVD

monotonic games, are increasingly used in different fields. Applications have
been built within computer science and artificial intelligence related to e.g.
decision making, image processing, machine learning for both classification,
and regression. Tools for measure identification have been built. In short, as
non-additive measures are more general than additive ones (i.e., than
probabilities), they have better modeling capabilities allowing to model
situations and problems that cannot be modeled by the latter. See e.g. the
application of non-additive measures and the Choquet integral to model both
Ellsberg paradox and Allais paradox.
  Because of that, there is an increasing need to analyze non-additive
measures. The need for distances and similarities to compare them is no
exception. Some work has been done for defining $f$-divergence for them. In
this work we tackle the problem of defining the optimal transport problem for
non-additive measures. Distances for pairs of probability distributions based
on the optimal transport are extremely used in practical applications, and they
are being studied extensively for their mathematical properties. We consider
that it is necessary to provide appropriate definitions with a similar flavour,

observed data is a very challenging but important task. Due to the limited
quantity and quality of observed data, and non-identifiability of causal graph,
it is almost impossible to infer a single precise DAG. Some methods approximate
the posterior distribution of DAGs to explore the DAG space via Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC), but the DAG space is over the nature of super-exponential
growth, accurately characterizing the whole distribution over DAGs is very
intractable. In this paper, we propose {Reinforcement Causal Structure Learning
on Order Graph} (RCL-OG) that uses order graph instead of MCMC to model
different DAG topological orderings and to reduce the problem size. RCL-OG
first defines reinforcement learning with a new reward mechanism to approximate
the posterior distribution of orderings in an efficacy way, and uses deep
Q-learning to update and transfer rewards between nodes. Next, it obtains the
probability transition model of nodes on order graph, and computes the
posterior probability of different orderings. In this way, we can sample on
this model to obtain the ordering with high probability. Experiments on
synthetic and benchmark datasets show that RCL-OG provides accurate posterior
probability approximation and achieves better results than competitive causal
discovery algorithms.

adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) for a wide
range of Reynolds numbers $Re_\tau = 1400 - 4000$. The study is based on
estimation of the convection velocity using decomposed streamwise skewness
factor introduced in (Drozdz A., Elsner W., Int. J. of Heat and Fluid Flow. 63
(2017) 67\-74) and verified by means of two-point correlation method. It was
shown that in the overlapping region of APG flows, the convection velocity
profiles (when scaled in viscous units) reassemble the universal logarithmic
law characteristic for the ZPG flows up to Clauser-Rota pressure gradient
parameter $\beta \lesssim 19$ for the considered range of Reynolds number, what
means that in the inner region of TBL the friction velocity in APG is not
proportional to $U$ (as in ZPG) but to $U_C$ instead. The physical mechanism
that explains the impact of increased convection velocity on the mean flow is
proposed. The difference between $U_C$ and $U$ increases as a function of APG,
which causes the stronger sweeping that enhances momentum transfer to the wall
and compensates the weaker mean shear profile that is created by lower
vorticity near the wall. This effect is a result of an enhancement of amplitude
modulation of the small scales by large scale motion. The process becomes more
pronounced as eddy density grows, so with increasing Re. The proposed model
addresses a number of literature observations found in adverse pressure
gradient flows which have been so far left without a well-founded explanation.

nature. As suggested by higher dimensional models, this unification may require
space and time variation of some dimensionless fundamental constants. In this
scenario, probing temporal variation of the electromagnetic fine structure
constant ($\alpha= \frac{e^2} {\hbar c}$) in low energy regimes at the
cosmological time scale is of immense interest. Atomic clocks are ideal
candidates for probing $\alpha$ variation because their transition frequencies
are measured to ultra-high precision accuracy. Since atomic transition
frequencies are functions of $\alpha$, measurements of clock frequencies at
different temporal and spatial locations can yield signatures to ascertain such
conjecture. Electrons in highly charged ions (HCIs) experience unusually
enhanced relativistic effects. Hence level-crossings can be observed often in
these ions compared to their isoelectronic neutral or singly charged atomic
systems. Such a process features by their more significant relativistic
sensitive coefficients ($q$) of atomic transitions. For unambiguous detection
of subtle changes in the transition frequencies due to $\alpha$ variation, it
would be judicious to contemplate transitions for which $q$ values are
enormous. HCIs are considered one of the most suitable candidates for making
atomic clocks as they are the least sensitive to external electromagnetic
fields owing to their exceptionally contracted orbitals. The first HCI clock
has been realized, but its accuracy is much less than the counter optical
clocks based on neutral atoms and singly charged ions. The realization of HCI
clocks can add an extra dimension to investigating fundamental physics. In this
work, we survey HCIs suitable for clock candidates on the grounds of general
features, including their potential to probe temporal variation of $\alpha$.

states at a high Chandrasekhar number of $Q=10^3$ over a range of the Rayleigh

deflation with a continuation of steady states at low Chandrasekhar number,
which allows us to explore the influence of the strength of the magnetic field
as $Q$ increases from low coupling, where the magnetic effect is almost
negligible, to strong coupling at $Q=10^3$. We discover a large profusion of
states with rich dynamics and observe a complex bifurcation structure with
several pitchfork, Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations. Our numerical simulations
show that the onset of bifurcations in the problem is delayed when $Q$
increases, while solutions with fluid velocity patterns aligning with the

branch of states that stabilizes at high magnetic coupling, suggesting that one

consistent word problems of TC (Transfer-Case) type, involving object transfers
among agents. Though we provide a dataset of consistent 2-agent TC-problems for
training, only about 36% of the outputs of an LSTM-based generator are found
consistent. We use an extension of TC-Ontology, proposed by us previously, to
determine the consistency of problems. Among the remaining 64%, about 40% have
minor errors which we repair using the same ontology. To check consistency and
for the repair process, we construct an instance-specific representation (ABox)
of an auto-generated problem. We use a sentence classifier and BERT models for
this task. The training set for these LMs is problem-texts where sentence-parts
are annotated with ontology class-names. As three-agent problems are longer,
the percentage of consistent problems generated by an LSTM-based approach drops
further. Hence, we propose an ontology-based method that extends consistent
2-agent problems into consistent 3-agent problems. Overall, our approach
generates a large number of consistent TC-type AWPs involving 2 or 3 agents. As
ABox has all the information of a problem, any annotations can also be

the bare mass of the lattice model receives an additive renormalization. In
order to measure this mass shift directly, we develop a method that is suitable
for the Hamiltonian formulation, which relies on the fact that the vacuum
expectation value of the electric field density vanishes when the renormalized
mass is zero. We examine the dependence of the mass shift on the lattice
spacing, the lattice volume, the $\theta$-parameter, and the Wilson parameter.
Using the mass shift, we then perform the continuum extrapolation of the
electric field density and compare the resulting mass dependence to the
analytical predictions of mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that
incorporating the mass shift significantly improves the continuum
extrapolation. Finally, we apply our method to the same model using staggered

high-energy nuclear (and possibly hadronic) collisions, where the process takes
place not in the vacuum, but in the presence of other color charges. We explore
its effect on the charmed hadron yields and kinematic distributions once the
latter is applied at the end of transport calculations used to simulate the
propagation of heavy quarks in the deconfined fireball produced in nuclear
collisions. The model is based on the formation of color-singlet clusters
through the recombination of charm quarks with light antiquarks or diquarks
from the same fluid cell. This local mechanism of color neutralization leads to
a strong space-momentum correlation, which provides a substantial enhancement
of charmed baryon production -- with respect to expectations based on $e^+e^-$
collisions -- and of the collective flow of all charmed hadrons. We also
discuss the similarities between our model and recently developed mechanisms
implemented in QCD event generators to simulate medium corrections to
hadronization in the presence of other nearby color charges.

descriptions to guide speech synthesis. Thus, we develop a text-to-speech (TTS)
system (dubbed as PromptTTS) that takes a prompt with both style and content
descriptions as input to synthesize the corresponding speech. Specifically,
PromptTTS consists of a style encoder and a content encoder to extract the
corresponding representations from the prompt, and a speech decoder to
synthesize speech according to the extracted style and content representations.
Compared with previous works in controllable TTS that require users to have
acoustic knowledge to understand style factors such as prosody and pitch,
PromptTTS is more user-friendly since text descriptions are a more natural way
to express speech style (e.g., ''A lady whispers to her friend slowly''). Given
that there is no TTS dataset with prompts, to benchmark the task of PromptTTS,
we construct and release a dataset containing prompts with style and content
information and the corresponding speech. Experiments show that PromptTTS can
generate speech with precise style control and high speech quality. Audio
samples and our dataset are publicly available.

the existence of stable solutions for popular combinatorial games that involve
the structure of matchings in graphs, such as network bargaining games and
cooperative matching games.
  The vertex-stabilizer problem asks to compute a minimum number of players to
block (i.e., vertices of G to remove) in order to ensure stability for such
games. The problem has been shown to be solvable in polynomial-time, for
unit-capacity graphs. This stays true also if we impose the restriction that
the set of players to block must not intersect with a given specified maximum
matching of G.
  In this work, we investigate these algorithmic problems in the more general
setting of arbitrary capacities. We show that the vertex-stabilizer problem
with the additional restriction of avoiding a given maximum matching remains
polynomial-time solvable. Differently, without this restriction, the
vertex-stabilizer problem becomes NP-hard and even hard to approximate, in
contrast to the unit-capacity case.
  Finally, in unit-capacity graphs there is an equivalence between the
stability of a graph, existence of a stable solution for network bargaining
games, and existence of a stable solution for cooperative matching games. We
show that this equivalence does not extend to the capacitated case.

than one pathology present. As such, image retrieval systems for the medical
domain must be designed for the multi-label scenario. In this paper, we propose
a novel multi-label metric learning method that can be used for both
classification and content-based image retrieval. In this way, our model is
able to support diagnosis by predicting the presence of diseases and provide
evidence for these predictions by returning samples with similar pathological
content to the user. In practice, the retrieved images may also be accompanied
by pathology reports, further assisting in the diagnostic process. Our method
leverages proxy feature vectors, enabling the efficient learning of a robust
feature space in which the distance between feature vectors can be used as a
measure of the similarity of those samples. Unlike existing proxy-based
methods, training samples are able to assign to multiple proxies that span
multiple class labels. This multi-label proxy assignment results in a feature
space that encodes the complex relationships between diseases present in
medical imaging data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval

performing detailed spectral analysis and model comparisons, we investigate two
GRB spectral-energy correlations: the cosmological rest-frame peak energy

tight correlation between $E_{\rm p,z}$ and $E_{\gamma, \rm iso}$ (and
$L_{\gamma,\rm iso}$) is found for both the Band-like and CPL-like bursts. More
interestingly, the CPL-like bursts do not fall on the Band-like burst Amati and
Yonetoku correlations, suggesting distinct radiation processes, and pointing
towards the fact that these spectral-energy correlations are tightly reliant on

Process mining techniques are used to characterize successful study paths, as

are combined with recommendations and requirements of the corresponding study
programs extracted from examination regulations. Here, event calculus and
answer set programming are used to provide models of the study programs which
support planning and conformance checking while providing feedback on possible

The clinical applicability of deep pose estimation models, however, is limited
by their poor generalization under domain shifts along with their need for
sufficient labeled training data. As a remedy, we present a novel domain
adaptation method, adapting a model from a labeled source to a shifted
unlabeled target domain. Our method comprises two complementary adaptation
strategies based on prior knowledge about human anatomy. First, we guide the
learning process in the target domain by constraining predictions to the space
of anatomically plausible poses. To this end, we embed the prior knowledge into
an anatomical loss function that penalizes asymmetric limb lengths, implausible
bone lengths, and implausible joint angles. Second, we propose to filter pseudo
labels for self-training according to their anatomical plausibility and
incorporate the concept into the Mean Teacher paradigm. We unify both
strategies in a point cloud-based framework applicable to unsupervised and
source-free domain adaptation. Evaluation is performed for in-bed pose
estimation under two adaptation scenarios, using the public SLP dataset and a
newly created dataset. Our method consistently outperforms various
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, surpasses the baseline model by

address to flexibly map to any physical address. This flexibility necessitates
large data structures to store virtual-to-physical mappings, which incurs
significantly high address translation latency and translation-induced
interference in the memory hierarchy, especially in data-intensive workloads.
Restricting the address mapping so that a virtual address can map to only a
specific set of physical addresses can significantly reduce the overheads
associated with the conventional address translation by making use of compact
and more efficient translation structures. However, restricting the address
mapping flexibility across the entire main memory severely limits data sharing
across different processes and increases memory under-utilization. In this
work, we propose Utopia, a new hybrid virtual-to-physical address mapping
scheme that allows both flexible and restrictive hash-based address mapping
schemes to co-exist in a system. The key idea of Utopia is to manage the
physical memory using two types of physical memory segments: restrictive
segments and flexible segments. A restrictive segment uses a restrictive,
hash-based address mapping scheme to map the virtual addresses to only a
specific set of physical addresses and enable faster address translation using
compact and efficient translation structures. A flexible segment is similar to
the conventional address mapping scheme and provides full virtual-to-physical
address mapping flexibility. By mapping data to a restrictive segment, Utopia
enables faster address translation with lower translation-induced interference
whenever a flexible address mapping is not necessary. Our evaluation using 11
data-intensive workloads shows that Utopia improves performance by 24% on
average in single-core workloads over the baseline four-level radix-tree page

features, traits, or opinions has been identified as one of the main driving
forces behind the formation of structured societies. Here we ask to what extent
homophily can explain the formation of social groups, particularly their size
distribution. We propose a spin-glass-inspired framework of self-assembly,
where opinions are represented as multidimensional spins that dynamically
self-assemble into groups; individuals within a group tend to share similar
opinions (intra-group homophily), and opinions between individuals belonging to
different groups tend to be different (inter-group heterophily). We compute the
associated non-trivial phase diagram by solving a self-consistency equation for
'magnetization' (combined average opinion). Below a critical temperature, there
exist two stable phases: one ordered with non-zero magnetization and large
clusters, the other disordered with zero magnetization and no clusters. The
system exhibits a first-order transition to the disordered phase. We
analytically derive the group-size distribution that successfully matches
empirical group-size distributions from online communities.

  monitoring","The paper is 35 pages long and it has 8 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  DNA-based biodiversity surveys involve collecting physical samples from
survey sites and assaying the contents in the laboratory to detect species via
their diagnostic DNA sequences. DNA-based surveys are increasingly being
adopted for biodiversity monitoring. The most commonly employed method is
metabarcoding, which combines PCR with high-throughput DNA sequencing to
amplify and then read `DNA barcode' sequences. This process generates count
data indicating the number of times each DNA barcode was read. However,
DNA-based data are noisy and error-prone, with several sources of variation. In
this paper, we present a unifying modelling framework for DNA-based data
allowing for all key sources of variation and error in the data-generating
process. The model can estimate within-species biomass changes across sites and
link those changes to environmental covariates, while accounting for species
and sites correlation. Inference is performed using MCMC, where we employ Gibbs
or Metropolis-Hastings updates with Laplace approximations. We also implement a
re-parameterisation scheme, appropriate for crossed-effects models, leading to
improved mixing, and an adaptive approach for updating latent variables,
reducing computation time. We discuss study design and present theoretical and
simulation results to guide decisions on replication at different stages and on
the use of quality control methods. We demonstrate the new framework on a
dataset of Malaise-trap samples. We quantify the effects of elevation and
distance-to-road on each species, infer species correlations, and produce maps
identifying areas of high biodiversity, which can be used to rank areas by
conservation value. We estimate the level of noise between sites and within
sample replicates, and the probabilities of error at the PCR stage, which are
close to zero for most species considered, validating the employed laboratory
processing.

length of $5.57\delta$ from protrusion face was traced from oil-flow
visualization. The averaged pressure distribution surveyed using static
pressure ports placed on the wall has mapped plateau, high-pressure, and a
low-pressure region in the separated flow, distinctive to three-dimensional

along mid-span in the different pressure zones. Significant spanwise `Mean
Reduction in Separation Length' of up to $0.93\delta$ was observed from

In this paper, we focus on predicting what types of returning strokes will be

has not been addressed to date, movement forecasting can be tackled through
sequence-based and graph-based models by formulating as a sequence prediction
task. However, existing sequence-based models neglect the effects of
interactions between players, and graph-based models still suffer from
multifaceted perspectives on the next movement. Moreover, there is no existing
work on representing strategic relations among players' shot types and
movements. To address these challenges, we first introduce the procedure of the
Player Movements (PM) graph to exploit the structural movements of players with
strategic relations. Based on the PM graph, we propose a novel Dynamic Graphs

style extractors to capture the mutual interactions of players themselves and
between both players within a rally, and dynamic players' tactics across time.
In addition, hierarchical fusion modules are designed to incorporate the style
influence of both players and rally interactions. Extensive experiments show
that our model empirically outperforms both sequence- and graph-based methods

computationally efficient. Therefore, SNNs have the natural advantage of
drawing the sparse structural plasticity of brain development to alleviate the
energy problems of deep neural networks caused by their complex and fixed
structures. However, previous SNNs compression works are lack of in-depth
inspiration from the brain development plasticity mechanism. This paper
proposed a novel method for the adaptive structural development of SNN
(SD-SNN), introducing dendritic spine plasticity-based synaptic constraint,
neuronal pruning and synaptic regeneration. We found that synaptic constraint
and neuronal pruning can detect and remove a large amount of redundancy in
SNNs, coupled with synaptic regeneration can effectively prevent and repair
over-pruning. Moreover, inspired by the neurotrophic hypothesis, neuronal
pruning rate and synaptic regeneration rate were adaptively adjusted during the
learning-while-pruning process, which eventually led to the structural
stability of SNNs. Experimental results on spatial (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and
temporal neuromorphic (N-MNIST, DVS-Gesture) datasets demonstrate that our
method can flexibly learn appropriate compression rate for various tasks and
effectively achieve superior performance while massively reducing the network
energy consumption. Specifically, for the spatial MNIST dataset, our SD-SNN
achieves 99.51\% accuracy at the pruning rate 49.83\%, which has a 0.05\%
accuracy improvement compared to the baseline without compression. For the
neuromorphic DVS-Gesture dataset, 98.20\% accuracy with 1.09\% improvement is

unsatisfied overall performance. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we
propose a novel Scope-Sensitive Result Attention Network (SSRAN) based on
Transformer, which contains a Scope Recognizer (SR) and a Result Attention
Network (RAN). Scope Recognizer assignments scope information to each token,
reducing the distraction of out-of-scope tokens. Result Attention Network
effectively utilizes the bidirectional interaction between results of slot

domain-specific language (DSL) to uniformly model optimization problems of this

associated objective functions. The framework can be instantiated to obtain an
optimizing Horn solver. As an illustration, the application of an optimizing

the future bits to be estimated later are treated as random variables. However,
polar codes inevitably involve frozen bits, and their concatenated coding
schemes also include parity bits causally generated from the past bits
estimated earlier. We refer to the frozen and parity bits located behind a
target decoding bit as its future constraints (FCs). Although the values of FCs
are deterministic given the past estimates, they have not been exploited in the
conventional SC-based decoders, not leading to optimality. In this paper, we
propose SC-check (SCC) and belief-propagation SCC (BP-SCC) decoding algorithms
in order to leverage FCs in decoding.We further devise a tree search technique
based on stack-based backjumping (SBJ) to solve dynamic constraint satisfaction
problems (CSPs) formulated by FCs. Over the binary erasure channel (BEC),
numerical results show that a combination of the BP-SCC algorithm and the SBJ
tree search technique achieves the erasure recovery performance close to the
dependence testing (DT) bound, a bound of achievable finite-length performance.

coronal plasma. We quantitatively assess the applicability of the weak thermal
conduction theory to coronal seismology by slow waves. We numerically model the
linear standing slow wave in a 1D coronal loop, with field-aligned thermal
conduction $\kappa_\parallel$ as a free parameter and no restrictions on its
efficiency. The time variations of the perturbed plasma parameters, obtained
numerically with full conductivity, are treated as potential observables and
analysed with the standard data processing techniques. The slow wave
oscillation period is found to increase with $\kappa_\parallel$ by about 30%,
indicating the corresponding modification in the effective wave speed, which is
missing from the weak conduction theory. Phase shifts between plasma
temperature and density perturbations are found to be well consistent with the
approximate weakly conductive solution for all considered values of
$\kappa_\parallel$. In contrast, the comparison of the numerically obtained
ratio of temperature and density perturbation amplitudes with the weak theory
revealed relative errors up to 30-40%. We use these parameters to measure the
effective adiabatic index of the coronal plasma directly as the ratio of the
effective slow wave speed to the standard sound speed and in the polytropic
assumption, which is found to be justified in a weakly conductive regime only,
with relative errors up to 14% otherwise. The damping of the initial
perturbation is found to be of a non-exponential form during the first cycle of
oscillation, which could be considered as an indirect signature of entropy
waves in the corona, also not described by weak conduction theory. The
performed analysis and obtained results offer a more robust scheme of coronal
seismology by slow waves, with reasonable simplifications and without the loss
of accuracy.

Spiking Neural Network (SNN) operation, based on a hardware-friendly photonic
system of just one Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL), is reported
alongside a novel binary weight 'significance' training scheme that fully
capitalises on the discrete nature of the optical spikes used by the SNN to
process input information. The VCSEL-based photonic SNN is tested with a highly
complex, multivariate, classification task (MADELON) before performance is
compared using a traditional least-squares training method and the alternative
novel binary weighting scheme. Excellent classification accuracies of >94% are
reached by both training methods, exceeding the benchmark performance of the

also dramatically reduces training set size requirements as well as the number
of trained nodes (<1% of the total network node count). This VCSEL-based
photonic SNN, in combination with the reported 'significance' weighting scheme,

prone to failure in weakly textured or motionless scenes, while standard
cameras can still provide appearance information in this case. Thus, exploiting
the complementarity of standard cameras and event cameras can effectively
improve the performance of VPR algorithms. In the paper, we propose
FE-Fusion-VPR, an attention-based multi-scale network architecture for VPR by
fusing frames and events. First, the intensity frame and event volume are fed
into the two-stream feature extraction network for shallow feature fusion.
Next, the three-scale features are obtained through the multi-scale fusion

However, it fails in describing the spatial nonuniform magnetic dynamics which
gives rises to many important phenomenons such as the domain walls and
skyrmions. Here we develop the two-dimensional atomistic model and provide a

spin-transfer torque, the magnetization oscillates in the exchange mode or the
flipped exchange mode. When the Gd composition is increased, the exchange mode
firstly disappears, and then appears again as the magnetization compensation

the spatial distribution of magnetization and effective fields. In particular,
when the sample is small, a spatial nonuniform oscillation is also observed in
the square film. Our work reveals the importance of spatial magnetic

perform a Gilbert-Eliott burst-error analysis that is analytically derived as a
combination of two separate latency measurement campaigns and provide an
upper-bound analysis of the UAVAP system. The analysis is centered around a
UAVAP that uses its LTE connection to reach the backhaul, while providing
service to ground nodes (GNs) with a Wi-Fi access point (AP). Thus, we combine
both measurement campaigns to analyze the plausibility of the described setup
in casual, crowded or mixed network settings.

Transformers in the frequency domain for high-quality image deblurring. Our
method is motivated by the convolution theorem that the correlation or
convolution of two signals in the spatial domain is equivalent to an
element-wise product of them in the frequency domain. This inspires us to
develop an efficient frequency domain-based self-attention solver (FSAS) to
estimate the scaled dot-product attention by an element-wise product operation
instead of the matrix multiplication in the spatial domain. In addition, we
note that simply using the naive feed-forward network (FFN) in Transformers
does not generate good deblurred results. To overcome this problem, we propose
a simple yet effective discriminative frequency domain-based FFN (DFFN), where
we introduce a gated mechanism in the FFN based on the Joint Photographic
Experts Group (JPEG) compression algorithm to discriminatively determine which
low- and high-frequency information of the features should be preserved for
latent clear image restoration. We formulate the proposed FSAS and DFFN into an
asymmetrical network based on an encoder and decoder architecture, where the
FSAS is only used in the decoder module for better image deblurring.
Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against
the state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be available at

applications, intuitively editing NeRF scenes is still an open challenge. One
important editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such
that the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context.
We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both
consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a
small set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our
framework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object.
Using the mask, a perceptual optimizationbased approach is then introduced that
leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D
space, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse
benchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset
comprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains
views of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more
principled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task. We first demonstrate the
superiority of our approach on multiview segmentation, comparing to NeRFbased
methods and 2D segmentation approaches. We then evaluate on the task of 3D
inpainting, establishing state-ofthe-art performance against other NeRF

under adverse conditions is demanding in the practical systems. One prevalent
solution is to bridge the domain gap between clear- and adverse-condition
images to make satisfactory prediction on the target. However, previous methods
often reckon on additional reference images of the same scenes taken from
normal conditions, which are quite tough to collect in reality. Furthermore,
most of them mainly focus on individual adverse condition such as nighttime or
foggy, weakening the model versatility when encountering other adverse
weathers. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel framework,
Visibility Boosting and Logit-Constraint learning (VBLC), tailored for superior
normal-to-adverse adaptation. VBLC explores the potential of getting rid of
reference images and resolving the mixture of adverse conditions
simultaneously. In detail, we first propose the visibility boost module to
dynamically improve target images via certain priors in the image level. Then,
we figure out the overconfident drawback in the conventional cross-entropy loss
for self-training method and devise the logit-constraint learning, which
enforces a constraint on logit outputs during training to mitigate this pain
point. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new perspective for tackling
such a challenging task. Extensive experiments on two normal-to-adverse domain

essential for identifying their host galaxy and understanding their mysterious

aims to predict missing relationships between entities. Recent subgraph-based
models for inductive relation prediction have received increasing attention,
which can predict relation for unseen entities based on the extracted subgraph
surrounding the candidate triplet. However, they are not completely inductive
because of their disability of predicting unseen relations. Moreover, they fail
to pay sufficient attention to the role of relation as they only depend on the
model to learn parameterized relation embedding, which leads to inaccurate
prediction on long-tail relations. In this paper, we introduce
Relation-dependent Contrastive Learning (ReCoLe) for inductive relation
prediction, which adapts contrastive learning with a novel sampling method
based on clustering algorithm to enhance the role of relation and improve the
generalization ability to unseen relations. Instead of directly learning
embedding for relations, ReCoLe allocates a pre-trained GNN-based encoder to
each relation to strengthen the influence of relation. The GNN-based encoder is
optimized by contrastive learning, which ensures satisfactory performance on
long-tail relations. In addition, the cluster sampling method equips ReCoLe
with the ability to handle both unseen relations and entities. Experimental
results suggest that ReCoLe outperforms state-of-the-art methods on commonly

into In-Candidate (IC) and OC groups for each OC pixel according to their prior
annotation correlation and posterior prediction correlation. Then, we derive a
differentiable rectification loss to force OC pixels to shift to the IC group.
Incorporating our OCR with seminal baselines (e.g., AffinityNet, SEAM,
MCTformer), we can achieve remarkable performance gains on both Pascal VOC
(+3.2%, +3.3%, +0.8% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.0%, +1.3%, +0.5% mIoU) datasets with
negligible extra training overhead, which justifies the effectiveness and
generality of our OCR.

variation during dental surgery on restoration lifetime. Methods: We have
coupled an environmental chamber to control both temperature and humidity on
the sample, with an optical microscope to measure precisely the strain on the
sample surface, after a quantification of the measurement noise. This set-up is
used on carefully prepared samples placed on a compression device to measure
the elastic parameters. Results: Dentin dilates when the relative humidity
increases, with a coefficient of hygroscopic expansion of typically 6.10-3
%.(%RH)-1. This dilatation occurs in about ten minutes. Young modulus and
Poisson's ratio are not modified by the variation of relative humidity.
Conclusions: Hygroscopic expansion is an order of magnitude larger than thermal

their ability to synthesize novel scene views with great accuracy. However,
inherent to their underlying formulation, the sampling of points along a ray
with zero width may result in ambiguous representations that lead to further
rendering artifacts such as aliasing in the final scene. To address this issue,
the recent variant mip-NeRF proposes an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE)
based on a conical view frustum. Although this is expressed with an integral
formulation, mip-NeRF instead approximates this integral as the expected value
of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This approximation is reliable for
short frustums but degrades with highly elongated regions, which arises when
dealing with distant scene objects under a larger depth of field. In this
paper, we explore the use of an exact approach for calculating the IPE by using
a pyramid-based integral formulation instead of an approximated conical-based
one. We denote this formulation as Exact-NeRF and contribute the first approach
to offer a precise analytical solution to the IPE within the NeRF domain. Our
exploratory work illustrates that such an exact formulation Exact-NeRF matches
the accuracy of mip-NeRF and furthermore provides a natural extension to more
challenging scenarios without further modification, such as in the case of
unbounded scenes. Our contribution aims to both address the hitherto unexplored

a received signal's raw I/Q samples, but they mostly are limited to
single-carrier signal recognition thus not pragmatic for identifying
spectro-temporal OFDM/OFDMA signals whose modulation varies with time and

DeepLabV3+'s 2D convolutions with 'flattened' convolutions to enforce the
time-frequency orthogonality constraint and to achieve the grid-like pattern of

namely, the heating of the solar chromosphere and the origin of the solar wind.
Our aim is to reveal the related mechanisms behind chromospheric heating and
plasma outflows in a quiet-Sun. \textbf{Methods:} The approach is based on a
two-fluid numerical model that accounts for thermal non-equilibrium
(ionization/recombination), non-adiabatic, and non-ideal dynamics of
protons+electrons and hydrogen atoms. The model is applied to numerically
simulate the propagation and dissipation of granulation-generated waves in the
chromosphere and plasma flows inside a quiet region. \textbf{Results:} The
obtained results demonstrate that collisions between protons+electrons and
hydrogen atoms supplemented by plasma viscosity, magnetic resistivity, and
recombination lead to thermal energy release, which compensates radiative and
thermal losses in the chromosphere, and sustains the atmosphere with vertical
profiles of averaged temperature and periods of generated waves that are
consistent with recent observational data. \textbf{Conclusion:} Our model
conjectures a most robust and global physical picture of granulation-generated
wave motions, plasma flows, and subsequent heating, which form and dynamically
couple the various layers of the solar atmosphere.

design considerations of safe marine vehicles. The water-entry problem is
firstly studied numerically using the finite-volume discretization of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the volume-of-fluid method to
capture the air-water interface. The choice of the mesh size and time-step is
validated by comparison with experimental data of a free fall water-entry of a
wedge. The key original contribution of the article concerns the derivation of
a relationship for azmax (as well as the correlated parameters when azmax
occurs), the initial velocity, the deadrise angle and the mass of the wedge
based on the transformation of von Karman momentum theory which is extended
with the inclusion of the pile-up effect. The pile-up coefficient, which has
been proven dependent on the deadrise angle in the case of water-entry with a
constant velocity, is then investigated for the free fall motion and the
dependence law derived from Dobrovol'skaya is still valid for varying deadrise
angle. Reasonable good theoretical estimates of the kinematic parameters are
provided for a relatively wide range of initial velocity, deadrise angle and
mass using the extended von Karman momentum theory which is the combination of
the original von Karman method and Dobrovol'skaya's solution and this
theoretical approach can be extended to predict the kinematic parameters during
the whole impacting phase.

The main challenge of exemplar-free continual learning is maintaining
plasticity of the learner without causing catastrophic forgetting of previously
learned tasks. This is often achieved via exemplar replay which can help
recalibrate previous task classifiers to the feature drift which occurs when
learning new tasks. Exemplar replay, however, comes at the cost of retaining
samples from previous tasks which for many applications may not be possible. To
address the problem of continual ViT training, we first propose gated
class-attention to minimize the drift in the final ViT transformer block. This
mask-based gating is applied to class-attention mechanism of the last
transformer block and strongly regulates the weights crucial for previous
tasks. Importantly, gated class-attention does not require the task-ID during
inference, which distinguishes it from other parameter isolation methods.
Secondly, we propose a new method of feature drift compensation that
accommodates feature drift in the backbone when learning new tasks. The
combination of gated class-attention and cascaded feature drift compensation
allows for plasticity towards new tasks while limiting forgetting of previous
ones. Extensive experiments performed on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and
ImageNet100 demonstrate that our exemplar-free method obtains competitive
results when compared to rehearsal based ViT methods.

this paper, we consider employing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)
for IBFD communications. While the BS transmits and receives the signals to and

reflection coefficients of the RIS to configure the wireless channel so that
the self-interference of the BS is sufficiently mitigated in the propagation
domain. Taking the impact of the quantization noise into account, we propose to
jointly design the downlink (DL) precoding matrix and the RIS coefficients to
maximize the sum of uplink (UL) and DL rates. The effectiveness of the proposed

scene understanding. While various point cloud completion models have
demonstrated their powerful capabilities, their robustness against adversarial
attacks, which have been proven to be fatally malicious towards deep neural
networks, remains unknown. In addition, existing attack approaches towards
point cloud classifiers cannot be applied to the completion models due to
different output forms and attack purposes. In order to evaluate the robustness
of the completion models, we propose PointCA, the first adversarial attack
against 3D point cloud completion models. PointCA can generate adversarial
point clouds that maintain high similarity with the original ones, while being
completed as another object with totally different semantic information.
Specifically, we minimize the representation discrepancy between the
adversarial example and the target point set to jointly explore the adversarial
point clouds in the geometry space and the feature space. Furthermore, to
launch a stealthier attack, we innovatively employ the neighbourhood density
information to tailor the perturbation constraint, leading to geometry-aware
and distribution-adaptive modifications for each point. Extensive experiments
against different premier point cloud completion networks show that PointCA can
cause a performance degradation from 77.9% to 16.7%, with the structure chamfer
distance kept below 0.01. We conclude that existing completion models are
severely vulnerable to adversarial examples, and state-of-the-art defenses for
point cloud classification will be partially invalid when applied to incomplete

  Motivating examples include the scientific process based on scientific

allows for errors. Furthermore, the process includes checks aimed at catching

  The two basic parameters associated with the checking process are the {\em

intelligent manufacturing process, while some limitations still need to be
addressed under such a context. First, existing reconstruction-based methods
struggle with the identity mapping of trivial shortcuts where the
reconstruction error gap is legible between the normal and abnormal samples,
leading to inferior detection capabilities. Then, the previous studies mainly
concentrated on the convolutional neural network (CNN) models that capture the
local semantics of objects and neglect the global context, also resulting in
inferior performance. Moreover, existing studies follow the individual learning
fashion where the detection models are only capable of one category of the
product while the generalizable detection for multiple categories has not been
explored. To tackle the above limitations, we proposed a self-induction vision
Transformer(SIVT) for unsupervised generalizable multi-category industrial
visual anomaly detection and localization. The proposed SIVT first extracts
discriminatory features from pre-trained CNN as property descriptors. Then, the
self-induction vision Transformer is proposed to reconstruct the extracted
features in a self-supervisory fashion, where the auxiliary induction tokens
are additionally introduced to induct the semantics of the original signal.
Finally, the abnormal properties can be detected using the semantic feature
residual difference. We experimented with the SIVT on existing Mvtec AD

state-of-the-art detection performance with an improvement of 2.8-6.3 in AUROC,

learned at a nuts-and-bolts level. What are the fundamental primitives of
neural network representations? Previous mechanistic descriptions have used
individual neurons or their linear combinations to understand the
representations a network has learned. But there are clues that neurons and
their linear combinations are not the correct fundamental units of description:
directions cannot describe how neural networks use nonlinearities to structure
their representations. Moreover, many instances of individual neurons and their
combinations are polysemantic (i.e. they have multiple unrelated meanings).
Polysemanticity makes interpreting the network in terms of neurons or
directions challenging since we can no longer assign a specific feature to a
neural unit. In order to find a basic unit of description that does not suffer
from these problems, we zoom in beyond just directions to study the way that
piecewise linear activation functions (such as ReLU) partition the activation
space into numerous discrete polytopes. We call this perspective the polytope
lens. The polytope lens makes concrete predictions about the behavior of neural
networks, which we evaluate through experiments on both convolutional image
classifiers and language models. Specifically, we show that polytopes can be
used to identify monosemantic regions of activation space (while directions are
not in general monosemantic) and that the density of polytope boundaries
reflect semantic boundaries. We also outline a vision for what mechanistic
interpretability might look like through the polytope lens.

These have long been recognized as parts of the crusts of fully differentiated
planetesimals. Thus, their multiplicity, distribution, and physical
characteristics are crucial for providing context for and constraining the
theoretical evolution models of the Solar System. In this work, we perform
spectral analysis with an extended data set of spectral measurements from the
ESA Gaia mission Data Release 3, thus increasing the sample size of the
analyzed V-types by more than three times as compared to the literature. Using
the data provided by Gaia we identified ~2000 possible V-type asteroids. About
350 of them successfully pass our data validation criteria. This sample
includes 31 new V-type asteroids beyond 2.5 au and 6 in the Phocaea region. We
confirm that the V-type asteroids in the middle and outer part of the main belt
show distinct spectral properties compared to typical vestoids. In the inner
main belt, we found a great diversity of spectral parameters among the V-types
in all populations. Number of asteroids show band depths even greater than that
of (1459) Magnya. Furthermore, some objects present 0.9~\textmu{}m band-centers
more than one standard deviation away from the typical value for vestoids.
However since the DR3 band centers are often overestimated, those findings are
to be confirmed. Overall our results indicate that the inner main belt may
contain remnants of multiple differentiated planetesimals, not just (4) Vesta.

develop a new class of image splicing detection and localization algorithms.
These algorithms identify spliced content by detecting localized

deep learning has enabled new forms of anti-forensic attacks, such as
adversarial examples and generative adversarial network (GAN) based attacks.
Thus far, however, no anti-forensic attack has been demonstrated against image
splicing detection and localization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new
GAN-based anti-forensic attack that is able to fool state-of-the-art splicing
detection and localization algorithms such as EXIF-Net, Noiseprint, and
Forensic Similarity Graphs. This attack operates by adversarially training an
anti-forensic generator against a set of Siamese neural networks so that it is
able to create synthetic forensic traces. Under analysis, these synthetic
traces appear authentic and are self-consistent throughout an image. Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate that our attack is capable of fooling
forensic splicing detection and localization algorithms without introducing
visually detectable artifacts into an attacked image. Additionally, we
demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing alternative attack approaches.

validated using the data from a new subject, hindering the utility of the
personalised musculoskeletal model in clinical applications. This paper
develops an active physics-informed deep transfer learning framework to enhance
the dynamic tracking capability of the musculoskeletal model on the unseen
data. The salient advantages of the proposed framework are twofold: 1) For the
generic model, physics-based domain knowledge is embedded into the loss
function of the data-driven model as soft constraints to penalise/regularise
the data-driven model. 2) For the personalised model, the parameters relating
to the feature extraction will be directly inherited from the generic model,
and only the parameters relating to the subject-specific inference will be
finetuned by jointly minimising the conventional data prediction loss and the
modified physics-based loss. In this paper, we use the synchronous muscle
forces and joint kinematics prediction from surface electromyogram (sEMG) as
the exemplar to illustrate the proposed framework. Moreover, convolutional

Transformers are relatively more biased towards functions of low sensitivity.
(ii) When trained on Boolean functions, both Transformers and LSTMs prioritize
learning functions of low sensitivity, with Transformers ultimately converging
to functions of lower sensitivity. (iii) On sparse Boolean functions which have
low sensitivity, we find that Transformers generalize near perfectly even in
the presence of noisy labels whereas LSTMs overfit and achieve poor
generalization accuracy. Overall, our results provide strong quantifiable
evidence that suggests differences in the inductive biases of Transformers and

storage. The vanadium redox flow battery is the most widely commercialized
system thanks to its chemical stability and performance. This work aims to
optimize the scheduling of a vanadium flow battery that stores energy produced
by a renewable power plant, keeping into account a thorough characterization of
the battery performance, with variable efficiencies and capacity fade effects.
A detailed characterization of the battery performance improves the calculation
of the optimal number of cycles and revenue associated with the battery use if
compared to the results obtained using simpler models, which take into account
constant efficiencies and no capacity fade effects. The presented problem is
nonlinear due to the functions of the battery efficiency, which depend upon
charging and discharging powers and state of charge with nonlinear, non-convex
correlations. The problem is linearized using convex hulls. The optimization
program also calculates the progressive battery capacity fade due to undesired
secondary electrochemical reactions and the economic impact of capacity
restoration through periodic maintenance. The final problem is solved as a
Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) to guarantee the global optimality of the
linearized problem. The proposed optimization model has been applied to two
different case studies: a case of energy arbitrage and a case of load-shifting.
The optimization results have been compared to those obtained with constant
battery efficiency models, which do not consider the capacity fade effects.
Results show that simpler models overestimate the optimal number of cycles of
the battery and the revenue by up to 15% if they do not take into account the
degradation model of the battery, and respectively up to 32% and 42% if they
also assume constant efficiency for the battery.

involves understanding the dynamics of the game, the complexity of events, and
the variation of video sequences. Most approaches have focused on the latter,
given that their models exploit the global visual features of the sequences. In
this work, we focus on the former by (a) identifying and representing the
players, referees, and goalkeepers as nodes in a graph, and by (b) modeling
their temporal interactions as sequences of graphs. For the player
identification, or player classification task, we obtain an accuracy of 97.72%
in our annotated benchmark. For the action spotting task, our method obtains an
overall performance of 57.83% average-mAP by combining it with other
audiovisual modalities. This performance surpasses similar graph-based methods

that equilibrium is achieved for all lattice potential depths that we sample,

thermalization is slow and non-exponential, requiring up to 500 tunneling

equilibration driven by lattice-light heating by varying the laser wavelength.
The thermalization timescale is comparable to the next-nearest-neighbor

We present DOLCE, a new deep model-based framework for LACT that uses a
conditional diffusion model as an image prior. Diffusion models are a recent
class of deep generative models that are relatively easy to train due to their
implementation as image denoisers. DOLCE can form high-quality images from
severely under-sampled data by integrating data-consistency updates with the
sampling updates of a diffusion model, which is conditioned on the transformed
limited-angle data. We show through extensive experimentation on several
challenging real LACT datasets that, the same pre-trained DOLCE model achieves
the SOTA performance on drastically different types of images. Additionally, we
show that, unlike standard LACT reconstruction methods, DOLCE naturally enables
the quantification of the reconstruction uncertainty by generating multiple

closure models. Adaptive symbols utilize gradient information to learn locally
optimal numerical constants during model training, for which we investigate two
types of nonlinear optimization algorithms. The second contribution of this
work is implementing two regularization techniques to incentivize the
development of implementable and interpretable closure models. We apply $L_2$
regularization to ensure small magnitude numerical constants and devise a novel
complexity metric that supports the development of low complexity models via
custom symbol complexities and multi-objective optimization. This extended
framework is employed to four use cases, namely rediscovering Sutherland's
viscosity law, developing laminar flame speed combustion models and training
two types of fluid dynamics turbulence models. The model prediction accuracy
and the convergence speed of training are improved significantly across all of
the more and less complex use cases, respectively. The two regularization
methods are essential for developing implementable closure models and we
demonstrate that the developed turbulence models substantially improve
simulations over state-of-the-art models.

important. One approach has been to look at the infinitely wide limits of such

learn features and the empirical kernel changes significantly during training
in contrast to infinite networks. In this work, we derive an iterative
linearised training method to investigate this distinction, allowing us to
control for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequency
of feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justify
iterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of the
infinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradient
descent training, which does. We also show that it is analogous to a damped
version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. We show that in
a variety of cases, iterative linearised training performs on par with standard
training, noting in particular how much less frequent feature learning is
required to achieve comparable performance. We also show that feature learning
is essential for good performance. Since such feature learning inevitably
causes changes in the NTK kernel, it provides direct negative evidence for the
NTK theory, which states the NTK kernel remains constant during training.

Editing (HAE), a simple yet effective method. Unlike other methods that work in
Euclidean space, HAE captures the hierarchy among images using data from seen
categories in hyperbolic space. Given a well-trained HAE, images of unseen
categories can be generated by moving the latent code of a given image toward
any meaningful directions in the Poincar\'e disk with a fixing radius. Most
importantly, the hyperbolic space allows us to control the semantic diversity
of the generated images by setting different radii in the disk. Extensive
experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE is capable of not only
generating images with promising quality and diversity using limited data but
achieving a highly controllable and interpretable editing process.

Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have been reported. To generate these phenomena,
electrons have to complete a closed intersurface orbit. Due to the unavoidable
impurities in real materials, this orbit would be destroyed by the impurity
scattering, which limits the detection of the surface states in WSMs. Here, we
investigate the RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities, solely mediated
by a single surface band, in semi-infinite WSMs. It is found that peculiar
oscillations and slowly decaying laws of the RKKY interaction can act as the
signals to capture the dispersive nature of the surface states of WSMs. The
underlying physics is attributed to two effects: the band-edge effect and the
bending effect of the surface band, which can control the RKKY interaction
individually or compete with each other to produce more complex magnetic
behaviors. In addition, the band-edge effect together with the finite Fermi
energy would result in another interesting oscillation with battering pattern.
All the results are significantly different from that in previous literatures
where surface states have to couple with bulk states (or other surface states
of different spins) to generate nonzero magnetic interaction. Compared to the
previous models of surface states, the model here is more practical and is
helpful for the deeper understanding of the surface magnetic properties in

distribution. Inspired by this intuition, in this work we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first method for learning a generative model of HDR

The key idea is to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate HDR
images which, when projected to LDR under various exposures, are
indistinguishable from real LDR images. The projection from HDR to LDR is
achieved via a camera model that captures the stochasticity in exposure and
camera response function. Experiments show that our method GlowGAN can
synthesize photorealistic HDR images in many challenging cases such as
landscapes, lightning, or windows, where previous supervised generative models
produce overexposed images. We further demonstrate the new application of
unsupervised inverse tone mapping (ITM) enabled by GlowGAN. Our ITM method does
not need HDR images or paired multi-exposure images for training, yet it
reconstructs more plausible information for overexposed regions than

massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF mMIMO) technology can provide
uniform services for all devices by deploying distributed access points (APs).
In this paper, we adopt CF mMIMO to support URLLC in a smart factory.
Specifically, we first derive the lower bound (LB) on achievable uplink data
rate under the finite blocklength (FBL) with imperfect channel state
information (CSI) for both maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and full-pilot
zero-forcing (FZF) decoders. \textcolor{black}{The derived LB rates based on

relatively strong seeding in the early Universe. One theory proposes that
magnetic fields of the order of $\mu$G were expelled by supernova (SN)

interiors. In this work, we calculate the maximum magnetic energy that can be
injected in the interstellar medium by a stellar cluster of mass $M_{cl}$ based
on what is currently known about stellar magnetism. We consider early-type
stars and adopt either a Salpeter or a top-heavy IMF. For their magnetic
fields, we adopt either a Gaussian or a bimodal distribution. The Gaussian
model assumes that all massive stars are magnetized with $10^3 < \langle B_*
\rangle < 10^4$ G, while the bimodal, consistent with observations of Milky Way
stars, assumes only 5-10 per cent of OB stars have $10^3 < \langle B_* \rangle
< 10^4$ G, while the rest have $10 < \langle B_* \rangle < 10^2$ G. We find
that the maximum magnetic energy that can be injected by a stellar population
is between $10^{-10}-10^{-7}$ times the total SN energy. The highest end of
these estimates is about five orders of magnitude lower than what is usually
employed in cosmological simulations, where about $10^{-2}$ of the SN energy is
injected as magnetic. Pure advection of the stellar magnetic field by SN
explosions is a good candidate for seeding a dynamo, but not enough to
magnetize galaxies. Assuming SNe as main mechanism for galactic magnetization,
the magnetic field cannot exceed an intensity of $10^{-7}$ G in the best-case
scenario for a population of $10^{5}$ solar masses in a superbubble of 300 pc
radius, while more typical values are between $10^{-10}-10^{-9}$~G. Therefore,
other scenarios for galactic magnetization at high redshift need to be
explored.

flow proposed recently [Yoshida et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 244501 (2017)] is

Crucially, the routing and charging activities of these fleets are impacted by
the design of the individual vehicles and the surrounding charging
infrastructure which, in turn, should be designed to account for the intended
fleet operation. This paper presents a modeling and optimization framework
where we optimize the activities of the fleet jointly with the placement of the
charging infrastructure. We adopt a mesoscopic planning perspective and devise
a time-invariant model of the fleet activities in terms of routes and charging
patterns, explicitly capturing the state of charge of the vehicles by
resampling the road network as a digraph with iso-energy arcs. Then, we cast
the problem as a mixed-integer linear program that guarantees global optimality
and can be solved in less than 10 min. Finally, we showcase two case studies
with real-world taxi data in Manhattan, NYC: The first one captures the optimal
trade-off between charging infrastructure prevalence and the empty-mileage
driven by the fleet. We observe that jointly optimizing the infrastructure
siting significantly outperforms heuristic placement policies, and that
increasing the number of stations is beneficial only up to a certain point. The
second case focuses on vehicle design and shows that deploying vehicles
equipped with a smaller battery results in the lowest energy consumption:
Although necessitating more trips to the charging stations, such fleets require
about 12% less energy than the vehicles with a larger battery capacity.

architectures for fluorescence imaging. In CLSM, a focused laser beam excites
the fluorescence emission from a specific specimen position. Some actuators
scan the probed region across the sample and a photodetector collects a single
intensity value for each scan point, building a two-dimensional image
pixel-by-pixel. Recently, new fast single-photon array detectors have allowed
the recording of a full bi-dimensional image of the probed region for each scan
point, transforming CLSM into image scanning microscopy (ISM). This latter
offers significant improvements over traditional imaging but requires an
optimal processing tool to extract a super-resolved image from the
four-dimensional dataset. Here we describe the image formation process in ISM
from a statistical point of view, and we use the Bayesian framework to
formulate a multi-image deconvolution problem. Notably, the single-photon
detector suffers exclusively from the photon shot noise, enabling the
development of an effective likelihood model. We derive an iterative likelihood
maximization algorithm and test it on experimental and simulated data.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ISM dataset is redundant, enabling the
possibility of obtaining reconstruction sampled at twice the scanning step. Our
results prove that in ISM, under appropriate conditions, the Nyquist-Shannon
sampling criterium is effectively relaxed. This finding can be exploited to
speed up the acquisition process by a factor of four, further improving the
versatility of ISM systems.

However, these methods have yet to be used to study coherence between emotional

we use emotion predictions from our transformer based emotion recognition model

proposed to synchronize the physical sensors and the numerical model using

method is derived using implicit time integration. The second-order ordinary
differential formulation and its projection-based reduced-order modeling is
used to avoid two times larger degrees of freedom within the state space form.
Then, the Tikhonov regularization noise-filtering algorithm is employed instead
of Kalman filtering. The performance of the proposed method is investigated on

ShearletX, a novel mask explanation method for image classifiers based on the

mask explanation methods are regularized by smoothness constraints that protect
against undesirable fine-grained explanation artifacts. However, the smoothness
of a mask limits its ability to separate fine-detail patterns, that are
relevant for the classifier, from nearby nuisance patterns, that do not affect
the classifier. ShearletX solves this problem by avoiding smoothness
regularization all together, replacing it by shearlet sparsity constraints. The
resulting explanations consist of a few edges, textures, and smooth parts of
the original image, that are the most relevant for the decision of the
classifier. To support our method, we propose a mathematical definition for
explanation artifacts and an information theoretic score to evaluate the

due to its ability to train models more efficiently on multiple tasks compared
to using a group of conventional single-task models. However, MTL can be
impractical as certain tasks can dominate training and hurt performance in
others, thus making some tasks perform better in a single-task model compared
to a multi-task one. Such problems are broadly classified as negative transfer,
and many prior approaches in the literature have been made to mitigate these
issues. One such current approach to alleviate negative transfer is to weight
each of the losses so that they are on the same scale. Whereas current loss
balancing approaches rely on either optimization or complex numerical analysis,
none directly scale the losses based on their observed magnitudes. We propose
multiple techniques for loss balancing based on scaling by the exponential
moving average and benchmark them against current best-performing methods on
three established datasets. On these datasets, they achieve comparable, if not
higher, performance compared to current best-performing methods.

process is a valuable tip not only from a purely theoretical, but also

in terms of the first-passage time statistics. Although first-passage
properties of diffusive processes, usually modeled by different types of the
linear differential equations, are permanently explored with unflagging
intensity, there still exists noticeable niche in this subject concerning the
study of the non-linear diffusive processes. Therefore, the objective of the
present paper is to fill this gap, at least to some extent. Here, we consider
the non-linear diffusion equation in which a diffusivity is power-law dependent
on the concentration/probability density, and analyse its properties from the
viewpoint of the first-passage time statistics. Depending on the value of the
power-law exponent, we demonstrate the exact and approximate expressions for
the survival probability and the first-passage time distribution along with its
asymptotic representation. These results refer to the freely and harmonically
trapped diffusing particle. While in the former case the mean first-passage
time is divergent, even though the first-passage time distribution is
normalized to unity, it is finite in the latter. To support this result, we
derive the exact formula for the mean first-passage time to the target
prescribed in the minimum of the harmonic potential.

any given subproblem. Eventually, every part of the search space will be either
explored or pruned by the algorithm, thus proving optimality. This paper
presents new ingredients to speed up the search by exploiting the structure of
dynamic programming models. The key idea is to prevent the repeated exploration
of nodes corresponding to the same dynamic programming states by storing and
querying thresholds in a data structure called the Barrier. These thresholds
are based on dominance relations between partial solutions previously found.
They can be further strengthened by integrating the filtering techniques
introduced by Gillard et al. in 2021. Computational experiments show that the
pruning brought by the Barrier allows to significantly reduce the number of
nodes expanded by the algorithm. This results in more benchmark instances of
difficult optimization problems being solved in less time while using narrower

realize an autonomous driving (AD) system. The key success factor of DRL is
that it embraces the perception capability of deep neural networks which,
however, have been proven vulnerable to Trojan attacks. Trojan attacks have
been widely explored in supervised learning (SL) tasks (e.g., image
classification), but rarely in sequential decision-making tasks solved by DRL.
Hence, in this paper, we explore Trojan attacks on DRL for AD tasks. First, we
propose a spatio-temporal DRL algorithm based on the recurrent neural network
and attention mechanism to prove that capturing spatio-temporal traffic
features is the key factor to the effectiveness and safety of a DRL-augment AD
system. We then design a spatial-temporal Trojan attack on DRL policies, where
the trigger is hidden in a sequence of spatial and temporal traffic features,
rather than a single instant state used in existing Trojan on SL and DRL tasks.
With our Trojan, the adversary acts as a surrounding normal vehicle and can
trigger attacks via specific spatial-temporal driving behaviors, rather than
physical or wireless access. Through extensive experiments, we show that while
capturing spatio-temporal traffic features can improve the performance of DRL
for different AD tasks, they suffer from Trojan attacks since our designed
Trojan shows high stealthy (various spatio-temporal trigger patterns),
effective (less than 3.1\% performance variance rate and more than 98.5\%
attack success rate), and sustainable to existing advanced defenses.

problems has tremendous potential. Research in this direction has focused on
the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, both because of its theoretical
centrality and practical importance. A major roadblock faced, though, is that
training sets are restricted to random formulas of size several orders of
magnitude smaller than formulas of practical interest, raising serious concerns
about generalization. This is because labeling random formulas of increasing
size rapidly becomes intractable. By exploiting the probabilistic method in a
fundamental way, we remove this roadblock entirely: we show how to generate
correctly labeled random formulas of any desired size, without having to solve
the underlying decision problem. Moreover, the difficulty of the classification
task for the formulas produced by our generator is tunable by varying a simple
scalar parameter. This opens up an entirely new level of sophistication for the
machine learning methods that can be brought to bear on Satisfiability. Using
our generator, we train existing state-of-the-art models for the task of
predicting satisfiability on formulas with 10,000 variables. We find that they
do no better than random guessing. As a first indication of what can be
achieved with the new generator, we present a novel classifier that performs
significantly better than random guessing 99% on the same datasets, for most
difficulty levels. Crucially, unlike past approaches that learn based on
syntactic features of a formula, our classifier performs its learning on a
short prefix of a solver's computation, an approach that we expect to be of

strength of which is related to the normalisation constant $\omega$ of the
two-particle states by $4\pi\,\omega^2$. The numerical value of
$4\pi\,\omega^2$ is found to match the experimental value of the
electromagnetic fine structure constant $\alpha$. This strongly suggests that
the correlation of two particles in an irreducible two-particle representation
of the Poincar\'e group manifests itself in the electromagnetic interaction.

generate natural-sounding text, there are growing concerns around possible
negative effects of LLMs such as data memorization, bias, and inappropriate
language. Unfortunately, the complexity and generation capacities of LLMs make
validating (and correcting) such concerns difficult. In this work, we introduce
ReLM, a system for validating and querying LLMs using standard regular
expressions. ReLM formalizes and enables a broad range of language model
evaluations, reducing complex evaluation rules to simple regular expression
queries. Our results exploring queries surrounding memorization, gender bias,
toxicity, and language understanding show that ReLM achieves up to 15x higher
system efficiency, 2.5x data efficiency, and increased statistical and
prompt-tuning coverage compared to state-of-the-art ad-hoc queries. ReLM offers
a competitive and general baseline for the increasingly important problem of
LLM validation.

  Transformations for profanity detection",,,,,"cs.CL cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  On current {\it e-}learning platforms, live classes are an important tool
that provides students with an opportunity to get more involved while learning
new concepts. In such classes, the element of interaction with teachers and
fellow peers helps in removing learning silos and gives each student a chance
to experience some aspects relevant to offline learning in this era of virtual
classes. One common way of interaction in a class is through the chats /
messaging framework, where the teacher can broadcast messages as well as get
instant feedback from the students in the live class. This freedom of
interaction is a crucial aspect for any student's learning growth but misuse of
it can have serious repercussions. Some miscreants use this framework to send
profane messages which can have a negative impact on other students as well as
the teacher of the class. These rare but high impact situations obviate the
need for automatic detection mechanisms that prevent the posting of such chats
on any platform. In this work we develop YZR-Net which is a self-supervised
framework that is able to robustly detect profane words used in a chat even if
the student tries to add clever modifications to fool the system. The matching
mechanism on token / word level allows us to maintain a compact as well as
dynamic profane vocabulary which can be updated without retraining the
underlying model. Our profanity detection framework is language independent and
can handle abuses in both English as well as its transliterated counterpart
Hinglish (Hindi language words written in English).

with human judgments. We define clear guidelines for minimal editing of
automatic hypotheses. We validate the guidelines using 4-way inter-annotator
agreement. We evaluate a large number of metrics in terms of correlation with
human judgments. The metrics we consider vary in terms of representation
(orthographic, phonological, semantic), directness (intrinsic vs extrinsic),
granularity (e.g. word, character), and similarity computation method. The
highest correlation to human judgment is achieved using transliteration
followed by text normalization. We release the first corpus for human

or more specifically machine learning (ML) algorithms for object recognition
and natural language processing - it seems to be the majority view that current
AI approaches are still no real match for natural intelligence (NI). More
importantly, philosophers have collected a long catalogue of features which
imply that NI works differently from current AI not only in a gradual sense,
but in a more substantial way: NI is closely related to consciousness,
intentionality and experiential features like qualia (the subjective contents
of mental states) and allows for understanding (e.g., taking insight into
causal relationships instead of 'blindly' relying on correlations), as well as
aesthetical and ethical judgement beyond what we can put into (explicit or
data-induced implicit) rules to program machines with. Additionally,
Psychologists find NI to range from unconscious psychological processes to
focused information processing, and from embodied and implicit cognition to
'true' agency and creativity. NI thus seems to transcend any neurobiological
functionalism by operating on 'bits of meaning' instead of information in the
sense of data, quite unlike both the 'good old fashioned', symbolic AI of the
past, as well as the current wave of deep neural network based, 'sub-symbolic'
AI, which both share the idea of thinking as (only) information processing. In
the following I propose an alternative view of NI as information processing
plus 'bundle pushing', discuss an example which illustrates how bundle pushing
can cut information processing short, and suggest first ideas for scientific
experiments in neuro-biology and information theory as further investigations.

design. For the material interpolation scheme, it is usual to employ the SIMP
(Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) or the homogenization based
interpolation function for the parameterization of the material properties with
respect to the design variables assigned to each finite element. For topology
optimization with single material design, i.e., solid or void, the
parameterization with 1 for solid and 0 for void becomes relatively straight
forward using a polynomial function. For the case of multiple materials, some
issues of the equality modeling of each material and \textcolor{red}{the clear
0, 1 result of each element for the topology optimization} issues become
serious because of the curse of the dimension. To relieve these issues, this
research proposes a new mapping based interpolation function for multi-material
topology optimization. Unlike the polynomial based interpolation, this new
interpolation is formulated by the ratio of the $p$-norm of the design
variables to the 1-norm of the design variable multiplied by the design
variable for a specific material. With this alternative mapping based
interpolation function, each material are equally modeled and \textcolor{red}{
the clear 0, 1 result of each material for the multi-material topology
optimization model} can be improved. This paper solves several topology
optimization problems to prove the validity of the present interpolation
function.

  Models",,,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Equation-based modelling is a powerful approach to tame the complexity of
large-scale simulation problems. Equation-based tools automatically translate
models into imperative languages. When confronted with nowadays' problems,
however, well assessed model translation techniques exhibit scalability issues,
that are particularly severe when models contain very large arrays. In fact,
such models can be made very compact by enclosing equations into looping
constructs, but reflecting the same compactness into the translated imperative
code is not trivial. In this paper, we face this issue by concentrating on a
key step of equations-to-code translation, the equation/variable matching. We
first show that an efficient translation of models with (large) arrays needs
awareness of their presence, by defining a figure of merit to measure how much
the looping constructs are preserved along the translation. We then show that
the said figure of merit allows to define an optimal array-aware matching, and
as our main result, that the so stated optimal array-aware matching problem is
NP-complete. As an additional result, we propose a heuristic algorithm capable
of performing array-aware matching in polynomial time. The proposed algorithm
can be proficiently used by model translator developers in the implementation
of efficient tools for large-scale system simulation.
