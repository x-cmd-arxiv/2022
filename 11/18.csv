beam transport and equipment design becomes essential. The future should be
equipped with planet-friendly facilities, that is, solutions that reduce
environmental impact and improve economic competitiveness. The tendency to
increase the intensity of the current and the power of the beams obliges us and
brings us to new challenges. Installations tend to have larger dimensions with
increased areas, volumes, weights and costs. A new ion beam transport prototype

trillion USD per year. In particular, this paper focuses on pricing in
e-commerce when the objective function is profit maximization and only
transaction data are available. This setting is one of the most common in
real-world applications. Our work aims to find a pricing strategy that allows
defining optimal prices at different volume thresholds to serve different
classes of users. Furthermore, we face the major challenge, common in
real-world settings, of dealing with limited data available. We design a
two-phase online learning algorithm, namely PVD-B, capable of exploiting the
data incrementally in an online fashion. The algorithm first estimates the
demand curve and retrieves the optimal average price, and subsequently it
offers discounts to differentiate the prices for each volume threshold. We ran
a real-world 4-month-long A/B testing experiment in collaboration with an
Italian e-commerce company, in which our algorithm PVD-B-corresponding to A
configuration-has been compared with human pricing specialists-corresponding to
B configuration. At the end of the experiment, our algorithm produced a total
turnover of about 300 KEuros, outperforming the B configuration performance by
about 55%. The Italian company we collaborated with decided to adopt our

supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, and propose
algorithms to learn the communication system and the task jointly in an

derive an inequality that resembles well-known entanglement criteria, but

This criterion is invariant under local unitary operations and can be used to
find regions in the space of moments of randomized correlations. After
implementing such an algorithm in practical cases, we show that it detects

dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online
nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex
optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable
guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other
frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other
control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform
comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control,
both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical
model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a
priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in
hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online
convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are
based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by
finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.

stellar values for species previously detected in the atmosphere of WASP-121b.
Our retrieval framework can also be used to identify potential exospheric

model Spitzer spectra by decomposing the continua into nuclear and star-forming
components from which we then measure the nuclear optical depth, $\tau_N$, of
the $9.8 \mu$m silicate absorption feature. We also use Spitzer spectral maps
to investigate how PAH EW ratios vary with aperture size for objects hosting
CONs. Results. We find that the nuclear optical depth, $\tau_N$, strongly
correlates with the HCN-vib emission line in the millimetre for CONs with a
Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91. We find the PAH EW ratios technique to
be effective at selecting CONs and robust against highly inclined galaxies
where strong dust lanes may mimic a CON like spectrum by producing a high
$\tau_N$. Our analysis of the Spitzer spectral maps showed that the efficacy of
the PAH EW ratios to isolate CONs is reduced when there is a strong
star-forming component from the host galaxy. In addition, we find that the use

valued centralized Markov decision process (MDP), where the agents' identities
are not relevant but only their state information is used for the optimal

and show that the strategies chosen based on this formulation, which only keep
track of how many agents are in the discretized aggregate sets, are nearly
optimal with increasing discretization rates. (iii) Finally, we look at large

Different from the usual approach in the literature, instead of going to the

further discretizations again, we perform approximations by choosing a smaller

magnetar) that powers two highly relativistic jets. To distinguish between

for these energetic explosions, our team studies the polarization of the light
during the first minutes after the explosion (using novel instruments on fully
autonomous telescopes around the globe) to directly probe the magnetic field
properties in these extragalactic jets. This technology allowed the detection
of highly polarized optical light in GRB 120308A and confirmed the presence of
mildly magnetized jets with large-scale primordial magnetic fields in a reduced

we discuss the observations of the most energetic and first GRB detected at
very high TeV energies, GRB 190114C, which opens a new frontier in GRB magnetic
field studies suggesting that some jets can be launched highly magnetized and
that the collapse and destruction of these magnetic fields at very early times
may have powered the explosion itself. Additionally, our most recent
polarimetric observations of the jet of GRB 141220A indicate that, when the
jetted ejected material is decelerated by the surrounding environment, the
magnetic field amplification mechanisms at the front shock (needed to generate
the observed synchrotron emission) produce small magnetic domains. These
measurements validate theoretical expectations and contrast with previous
observations that suggest large magnetic domains in collisionless shocks (i.e.

on developing a mixed precision scheme or learning the best way to partition a

improve the accuracy of networks that have already been quantized, simply by
perturbing the quantization scales. Borrowing the idea of contrastive loss from
self-supervised learning, we find a robust way to jointly minimize a loss
function using just 1,000 calibration images. In order to determine the best
performing quantization scale, CPT-V contrasts the features of quantized and
full precision models in a self-supervised fashion.
  Unlike traditional reconstruction-based loss functions, the use of a
contrastive loss function not only rewards similarity between the quantized and
full precision outputs but also helps in distinguishing the quantized output
from other outputs within a given batch. In addition, in contrast to prior
works, CPT-V proposes a block-wise evolutionary search to minimize a global
contrastive loss objective, allowing for accuracy improvement of existing
vision transformer (ViT) quantization schemes. For example, CPT-V improves the
top-1 accuracy of a fully quantized ViT-Base by 10.30%, 0.78%, and 0.15% for

mechanical manipulation of polar skyrmions in ferroelectric superlattices by
applying external local compressive stress through an atomic force microscopy

force (<1 uN), the skyrmions coalesce to form a long stripe; while increasing
the applied load (e.g., above 2 uN) leads to the suppression of spontaneous
polarization, forming a new metastable topological structure, namely the
post-skyrmion. It is constructed by attaching multiple merons onto a center
Bloch skyrmion, showing a topological charge of 1.5 (under 2 uN) or 2 (under 3

first-passage time (FPT) quantities for the spectator field. The EEOM for the
one- and two-point function are enough to accurately predict the average time
taken $\left\langle \mathcal{N}\right\rangle$ to travel between two field
values with a barrier in between and the variation in that time $\delta
\mathcal{N}^2$. It can also accurately resolve the full PDF for time taken
$\rho (\mathcal{N})$, predicting the correct exponential tail. This suggests
that an extension of this analysis to the inflaton can correctly capture the
exponential tail that is expected in models producing Primordial Black Holes.

the rates obtained by such an approach strongly depend on the rather arbitrary
choice one makes for these model functions. An alternative approach, consisting
in monitoring the radial evolution of the adiabatic invariants, based on
locally and consistently measured plasma and magnetic field parameters, is free
from such a flaw. We apply this technique to a recently released Helios proton
dataset, and confirm the existence of a clear perpendicular heating of solar
wind's protons. On the other hand, no significant change in the parallel
adiabatic invariant is visible in the data. We conclude that to date, and in
the distance range of 0.3 to 1 AU, no clear observation of a deviation of solar
wind's protons from parallel adiabaticity has ever been made.

energy conservation alone implies strong constraints on the threshold
singularity structure of Feynman diagrams. In particular, we show that it
implies a representation of loop integrals in terms of Fourier transforms of
non-simplicial convex cones. We then engineer a triangulation that has a direct
diagrammatic interpretation in terms of a straightforward edge-contraction

Fourier integrations in closed form, yielding the novel Cross-Free Family
three-dimensional representation of loop integrals. Contrary to the TOPT and

expressed in terms of the graph-theoretic notions of connectedness and

Computing an MPC is a basic polynomial problem, dating back to Dilworth's and

performance limitation below nominal during magnet testing. A novel inspection
method, including advanced non-destructive and destructive techniques, was
developed to explore the root-causes of quenches occurring in
performance-limiting coils. The most relevant results obtained for MQXF coils
through this innovative inspection method are presented. This approach allows
for precise assessment of the physical events associated to the quenches
experienced b y magnet coils, mainly occurring under the form of damaged
strands with transversely broken sub-elements. Coil-slice preparation,
micro-optical observations of transverse and longitudinal cross-sections, and a
deep etching technique of copper will be illustrated in the present work, with
a focus on the results achieved for a CERN coil from a non-conforming
quadrupole magnet prototype, and two coils fabricated in the US, in the
framework of the Accelerator Upgrade Project (AUP) collaboration, from two
different non-conforming quadrupole magnets, respectively. The results obtained
through the proposed inspection method will be illustrated.

message remains intact. Quantum error correction and quantum authentication
both aim to protect (quantum) information, but approach this task from two very
different directions: error-correcting codes protect against probabilistic
channel noise and are meant to be very robust against small errors, while
authentication codes prevent adversarial attacks and are designed to be very
sensitive against any error, including small ones.
  In practice, when sending an authenticated state over a noisy channel, one
would have to wrap it in an error-correcting code to counterbalance the
sensitivity of the underlying authentication scheme. We study the question of
whether this can be done more efficiently by combining the two functionalities
in a single code. To illustrate the potential of such a combination, we design
the threshold code, a modification of the trap authentication code which
preserves that code's authentication properties, but which is naturally robust
against depolarizing channel noise. We show that the threshold code needs
polylogarithmically fewer qubits to achieve the same level of security and
robustness, compared to the naive composition of the trap code with any
concatenated CSS code. We believe our analysis opens the door to combining more
general error-correction and authentication codes, which could improve the
practicality of the resulting scheme.

``\textit{is not an option}'', because of the wide gap between the observation
time required to collect statistically valid data and the mutational times of
the organisms under study. Here, we have taken a first step towards a possible
solution of this problem by exploiting modern machine learning (ML) methods to
reduce the duration of MOT measurements from several tens of minutes down to
one second. This has been achieved by focusing on the analysis of computer
simulated trajectories of an optically trapped particle suspended in a set of
Newtonian fluids having viscosity values spanning three orders of magnitude,
i.e. from $10^{-3}$ to $1$ Pa$\cdot$s. When the particle trajectory is analysed
by means of conventional statistical mechanics principles, we explicate for the
first time in literature the relationship between the required duration of MOT
experiments ($T_m$) and the fluids relative viscosity ($\eta_r$) to achieve an
uncertainty as low as $1\%$; i.e., $T_m\cong 17\eta_r^3$ minutes. This has led
to further evidences explaining why conventional MOT measurements commonly
underestimate the materials' viscoelastic properties, especially in the case of
high viscous fluids or soft-solids such as gels and cells. Finally, we have
developed a ML algorithm to determine the viscosity of Newtonian fluids that
uses feature extraction on raw trajectories acquired at a kHz and for a
duration of only one second, yet capable of returning viscosity values carrying
an error as low as $\sim0.3\%$ at best; hence the opening of a doorway for MOT
in living systems.

successful experiments. In this paper, we present QUESO, an efficient approach
for automatically synthesizing a quantum-circuit optimizer for a given quantum
device. For instance, in 1.2 minutes, QUESO can synthesize an optimizer with
high-probability correctness guarantees for IBM computers that significantly
outperforms leading compilers, such as IBM's Qiskit and TKET, on the majority

  A number of theoretical and algorithmic insights underlie QUESO: (1) An
algebraic approach for representing rewrite rules and their semantics. This
facilitates reasoning about complex symbolic rewrite rules that are beyond the
scope of existing techniques. (2) A fast approach for probabilistically
verifying equivalence of quantum circuits by reducing the problem to a special
form of polynomial identity testing. (3) A novel probabilistic data structure,

associative memories (BAMs). Introduced by Kosko in 1988 as a generalization of
the Hopfield model to a bipartite structure, the simplest architecture is
defined by two layers of neurons, with synaptic connections only between units
of different layers: even without internal connections within each layer,
information storage and retrieval are still possible through the reverberation
of neural activities passing from one layer to another. We characterize the
computational capabilities of a stochastic extension of this model in the
thermodynamic limit, by applying rigorous techniques from statistical physics.
A detailed picture of the phase diagram at the replica symmetric level is
provided, both at finite temperature and in the noiseless regimes. Also for the
latter, the critical load is further investigated up to one step of replica
symmetry breaking. An analytical and numerical inspection of the transition
curves (namely critical lines splitting the various modes of operation of the
machine) is carried out as the control parameters - noise, load and asymmetry
between the two layer sizes - are tuned. In particular, with a finite asymmetry
between the two layers, it is shown how the BAM can store information more
efficiently than the Hopfield model by requiring less parameters to encode a
fixed number of patterns. Comparisons are made with numerical simulations of
neural dynamics. Finally, a low-load analysis is carried out to explain the
retrieval mechanism in the BAM by analogy with two interacting Hopfield models.
A potential equivalence with two coupled Restricted Boltmzann Machines is also
discussed.

($\langle R\rangle\sim 1\,R_\mathrm{e}$) betraying ongoing star formation in a
number of these objects. Activity gradients averaged over bins of
galactocentric radius up to $\sim 1.5\,R_\mathrm{e}$ have been measured in the
subspace defined by the first two principal components of the optical spectra
of these galaxies. We find that the sign of the gradients is closely related to
the presence of such rings in the spectral maps, which are especially
conspicuous in the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ emission line,
EW(H$\alpha$), with a fractional abundance
$\unicode{x2014}21\unicode{x2013}34\%\unicode{x2014}$ notably larger than that
inferred from optical images. While the numbers of S0s with positive, negative,
and flat activity gradients are comparable, star-forming rings are largely
found in objects for which quenching proceeds from the inside out, in good
agreement with predictions from cosmological simulations studying S0 buildup.
Assessment of these ringed structures indicates that their frequency increases
with the mass of their hosts, that they have shorter lifetimes in galaxies with
ongoing star formation, that they may feed on gas from the disks, and that the
local environment does not play a relevant role in their formation. We conclude
that the presence of inner rings in the EW(H$\alpha$) is a common phenomenon in
fully formed S0s, possibly associated with annular disk resonances driven by
weakly disruptive mergers preferentially involving a relatively massive primary
galaxy and a tiny satellite strongly bound to the former.

training procedure. This paper presents a new curriculum learning approach for
the efficient training of visual backbones (e.g., vision Transformers). Our
work is inspired by the inherent learning dynamics of deep networks: we
experimentally show that at an earlier training stage, the model mainly learns
to recognize some 'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns within each
example, e.g., the lower-frequency components of images and the original
information before data augmentation. Driven by this phenomenon, we propose a
curriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at each
epoch, while the curriculum starts with only exposing the 'easier-to-learn'
patterns of each example, and introduces gradually more difficult patterns. To
implement this idea, we 1) introduce a cropping operation in the Fourier
spectrum of the inputs, which enables the model to learn from only the
lower-frequency components efficiently, 2) demonstrate that exposing the
features of original images amounts to adopting weaker data augmentation, and
3) integrate 1) and 2) and design a curriculum learning schedule with a
greedy-search algorithm. The resulting approach, EfficientTrain, is simple,
general, yet surprisingly effective. In the absence of hyper-parameter tuning,
it reduces the training wall-time of a wide variety of popular models (e.g.,
ResNet, ConvNeXt, DeiT, PVT, Swin, and CSWin) by >1.5x on ImageNet-1K/22K
without sacrificing the accuracy. It is also effective for self-supervised
learning (e.g., MAE). Code is available at

Secondly, we demonstrate the sensitivity of commonly used metrics to a range of

comprehensive validation studies performed with patient data from six clinical

to high inter-center variability. Furthermore, our results clearly demonstrate
that the adaptation of standard hyperparameters used in the computer vision
community does not generally lead to the clinically most plausible results.
Finally, we present localization criteria that correspond well to clinical

open-source MATLAB/Simulink simulator for rigid-body articulated systems,
including manipulators and floating-base robots. Thanks to MATLAB/Simulink
features like MATLAB system classes and Simulink function blocks, the presented
simulator combines a programmatic and block-based approach, resulting in a
flexible design in the sense that different parts, including its physics
engine, robot-ground interaction model, and state evolution algorithm are
simply accessible and editable. Moreover, through the use of Simulink dynamic
mask blocks, the proposed simulation framework supports robot models
integrating open-chain and closed-chain kinematics with any desired number of
links interacting with the ground. The simulator can also integrate
second-order actuator dynamics. Furthermore, the simulator benefits from a
one-line installation and an easy-to-use Simulink interface.

Western Journal, aspiring writers post their writings for various reasons with
their names often proudly open. However, it may occur that such a writer wants
to write in other venues anonymously or under a pseudonym (e.g., activist,
whistle-blower). However, if an attacker has already built an accurate
authorship attribution (AA) model based off of the writings from such
platforms, attributing an anonymous writing to the known authorship is
possible. Therefore, in this work, we ask a question ""can one make the writings
and texts, T, in the open spaces such as opinion sharing platforms
unattributable so that AA models trained from T cannot attribute authorship
well?"" Toward this question, we present a novel solution, UPTON, that exploits
textual data poisoning method to disturb the training process of AA models.
UPTON uses data poisoning to destroy the authorship feature only in training
samples by perturbing them, and try to make released textual data unlearnable
on deep neuron networks. It is different from previous obfuscation works, that
use adversarial attack to modify the test samples and mislead an AA model, and
also the backdoor works, which use trigger words both in test and training
samples and only change the model output when trigger words occur. Using four
authorship datasets (e.g., IMDb10, IMDb64, Enron and WJO), then, we present
empirical validation where: (1)UPTON is able to downgrade the test accuracy to
about 30% with carefully designed target-selection methods. (2)UPTON poisoning
is able to preserve most of the original semantics. The BERTSCORE between the
clean and UPTON poisoned texts are higher than 0.95. The number is very closed
to 1.00, which means no sematic change. (3)UPTON is also robust towards
spelling correction systems.

  local and global ductility in dual-phase steels",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimental findings in the literature reveal that DP steels with identical
strength and composition, but different microstructures, exhibit inconsistent
trends under either necking-controlled or damage-controlled ductility tests. A
special case of this phenomenon is referred to in the forming community as the
cut-edge failure or edge cracking issue of DP steels. It is observed that
globally ductile microstructures are prone to premature damage at cut edges
while a comparatively less ductile DP steel performs better under the locally
applied deformation at such edges. In this paper, a systematical statistical
study is conducted to analyse this paradox from a micromechanical point of
view. The obtained results qualitatively confirm the experimental observations
and allowed us to explain/rationalize them, as follows. To reach a higher
necking-controlled ductility, i.e. global ductility, the mechanical contrast
between ferrite and martensite must be increased. Since martensite reveals a
very high initial hardening and fast saturation, activation of martensite
plasticity will lead to early necking in the microstructure and should
therefore be avoided; a high mechanical phase contrast has this effect.
However, at the same time a higher mechanical phase contrast is detrimental for
the local ductility. More heterogeneity in the microstructure causes the
generation of higher local plastic strains and triaxial stresses which leads to
early damages. Therefore, in DP steel, increasing the global ductility may come
at the expense of decreasing local ductility, and vice versa. The martensite
hardening behavior is the main factor governing this phenomenon, and therefore
also constitutes the key to processing improved steels that combine the best of
both.

if for any set of vertices of fractional size at most $\varepsilon$, at least
$\gamma$ of the edges that are adjacent to it go outside. In this paper, we
give a unified approach to several known complexity-theoretic results on
small-set expanders. In particular, we show:
  1. Max-Cut: we show that if a regular graph $G = (V,E)$ is an
$(\varepsilon,\gamma)$ small-set expander that contains a cut of fractional
size at least $1-\delta$, then one can find in $G$ a cut of fractional size at
least $1-O\left(\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon\gamma^6}\right)$ in polynomial time.
  2. Improved spectral partitioning, Cheeger's inequality and the parallel
repetition theorem over small-set expanders. The general form of each one of
these results involves square-root loss that comes from certain rounding
procedure, and we show how this can be avoided over small set expanders.
  Our main idea is to project a high dimensional vector solution into a
low-dimensional space while roughly maintaining $\ell_2^2$ distances, and then
perform a pre-processing step using low-dimensional geometry and the properties
of $\ell_2^2$ distances over it. This pre-processing leverages the small-set
expansion property of the graph to transform a vector valued solution to a
different vector valued solution with additional structural properties, which
give rise to more efficient integral-solution rounding schemes.

pulse is restricted by the carrier relaxation time. These limitations can be
overcome by modulating, instead, the loss of the laser by the scheme of cavity
dumping, which is ideal for intense and ultrashort pulse extraction. However,
the miniaturization of cavity-dumped lasers has been a long-standing challenge,
and no microscopic cavity-dumped lasers were yet realized. Here we demonstrate
an ultra-small cavity-dumped microscopic laser based on an optical Fano
resonance, which generates optical pulses with peak power more than one order
of magnitude higher than the corresponding conventional gain-modulated laser.
This demonstration paves the way for realizing microscopic lasers for low-power
chip-scale applications.

reported different CDW orders with transition temperatures in the range of 130
to 220 K, making this monolayer very controversial. Here we perform
first-principles non-perturbative anharmonic phonon calculations in monolayer

temperature. Our analysis solves previous experimental contradictions as we
reveal that monolayer VSe$_2$ develops two independent charge density wave
orders associated to $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{7}$ and $4 \times 4$ modulations
that compete as a function of strain. In fact, tiny variations of only 1.5% in
the lattice parameter are enough to stabilize one order or the other, which
underlines that the CDW order becomes substrate-dependent. The predicted CDW
temperature is strain-dependent and has a value of around 220 K, in good
agreement with experiments. Moreover, we analyze the impact of external
Lennard-Jones interactions on the CDW. We show that these can act together with
the anharmonicity to suppress the CDW orders. In the particular case of

learning-based framework to generate counterfactual explanations. The key idea
is to train a surrogate model to learn the effect of removing a subset of user
history on the recommendation. To this end, we first artificially simulate the
counterfactual outcomes on the recommendation after deleting subsets of
history. Then we train a surrogate model to learn the mapping between a history
deletion and the corresponding change of the recommendation caused by the
deletion. Finally, to generate an explanation, we find the history subset
predicted by the surrogate model that is most likely to remove the
recommendation. Through offline experiments and online user studies, we show
our method, compared to baselines, can generate explanations that are more
counterfactually valid and more satisfactory considered by users.

  substructure",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In particular types of layer- or lamellar-like microstructures such as
pearlite and lath martensite, plastic slip occurs favorably in directions
parallel to inter-lamellar boundaries. This may be due to the interplay between
morphology and crystallographic orientation or, more generally, due to
constraints imposed on the plastic slip due to the lamellar microstructural
geometry. This paper proposes a micromechanics based, computationally
efficient, scale independent model for particular type of lamellar
microstructures containing softer lamellae, which are sufficiently thin to be
considered as discrete slip planes embedded in a matrix representing the harder
lamellae. Accordingly, the model is constructed as an isotropic visco-plastic
model which is enriched with an additional orientation-dependent planar plastic
deformation mechanism. This additional mode is activated when the applied load,
projected on the direction of the soft films, induces a significant amount of
shear stress. Otherwise, the plastic deformation is governed solely by the
isotropic part of the model. The response of the proposed model is assessed via
a comparison to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an infinite periodic
two-phase laminate. It is shown that the yielding behavior of the model follows
the same behavior as the reference model. It is observed that the proposed
model is highly anisotropic, and the degree of anisotropy depends on the
contrast between the slip resistance (or yield stress) of the planar mode
versus that of the isotropic part. The formulation is then applied to model the
substructure of lath martensite with inter-layer thin austenite films. It is
exploited in a mesoscale simulation of a dual-phase (DP) steel
microstructure.The results are compared with those of a standard isotropic
model and a full crystal plasticity model.

  welcome",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a pivotal role in regulating gas flows
around galaxies and thus shapes their evolution. However, the details of how
galaxies and their CGM co-evolve remain poorly understood. We present a new
time-dependent two-zone model that self-consistently tracks not just mass and
metal flows between galaxies and their CGM but also the evolution of the global
thermal and turbulent kinetic energy of the CGM. Our model accounts for heating
and turbulence driven by both supernova winds and cosmic accretion as well as
radiative cooling, turbulence dissipation, and halo outflows due to CGM
overpressurization. We demonstrate that, depending on parameters, the CGM can
undergo a phase transition (``thermalization'') from a cool,
turbulence-supported phase to a virial-temperature, thermally-supported phase.
This CGM phase transition is largely determined by the ability of radiative
cooling to balance heating from supernova winds and turbulence dissipation. We
perform an initial calibration of our model to the FIRE-2 cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations and show that it is remarkably successful in
reproducing the baryon cycles of the simulated galaxies and their CGM. In
particular, we find that, for these parameters, the phase transition occurs at
high-redshift in ultrafaint progenitors and at low redshift in classical
$M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{11}M_{\odot}$ dwarfs, while Milky Way-mass halos undergo
the transition at $z\approx0.5$, in agreement with the simulations. We discuss
the ways in which our model is complementary to existing approaches for
modeling the CGM--galaxy connection and possible future directions.

identifies features in a record with a strong statistical connection to the

decreases the time complexity of the algorithm, it also decreases noise within
the data which assists in avoiding overfitting. In all, feature selection
assists in training a robust statistical model that performs well and is
stable. Given the lack of scalability in classical computation, current
techniques only consider the predictive power of the feature and not redundancy
between the features themselves. Recent advancements in feature selection that
leverages quantum annealing (QA) gives a scalable technique that aims to
maximize the predictive power of the features while minimizing redundancy. As a
consequence, it is expected that this algorithm would assist in the
bias/variance trade-off yielding better features for training a statistical

show the geometrical equivalence between a two-harmonic-mode coupled system of
ordinary differential equations arising from a weakly nonlinear analysis of the

multiple-time-scale expansion as a reduced model of the dynamics. Then,
inspired by the well-known delay behavior of time-dependent Hopf bifurcations,
we design a slowly time-varying magnetic field such that the timing and

the dynamic bifurcation and delayed onset of instability. The amplitude

introduce loss and noise that will degrade the performance of a quantum
network. We explore how DPTs can be used to construct a network capable of
distributing remote two-mode microwave entanglement over an optical link by
comparing fourteen different network topologies. The fourteen topologies we
analyze consist of combinations of different transducer operations, entangled
resources, and entanglement swapping measurements. For each topology, we derive
a necessary and sufficient analytic threshold on DPT parameters that must be
exceeded in order to distribute microwave-microwave entanglement. We find that
the thresholds are dependent on the given network topology, along with the
available entanglement resources and measurement capabilities. In the high
optical loss limit, which is relevant to realistic networks, we find that
down-conversion of each half of an optical two-mode squeezed vacuum state is
the most robust topology. Finally, we numerically evaluate the amount of
microwave--microwave entanglement generated for each topology using currently
achievable values for DPT parameters, entangled resources, and swapping
measurements, finding the encouraging result that several topologies are within
reach of current experimental capabilities.

transfer that knowledge to a pretrained 3D object generative latent space to
unravel disentangled embeddings to represent different shape semantics of
component parts of an object in the form of linear subspaces, despite the
unavailability of part-level labels during the training. Finally, we utilize
those identified subspaces to show that controllable 3D object part

that 3DLatNav outperforms existing unsupervised latent disentanglement methods

  Reweighted Eigenvalues","51 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM cs.LG math.CO math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We derive Cheeger inequalities for directed graphs and hypergraphs using the
reweighted eigenvalue approach that was recently developed for vertex expansion
in undirected graphs [OZ22,KLT22,JPV22]. The goal is to develop a new spectral
theory for directed graphs and an alternative spectral theory for hypergraphs.
  The first main result is a Cheeger inequality relating the vertex expansion
$\vec{\psi}(G)$ of a directed graph $G$ to the vertex-capacitated maximum
reweighted second eigenvalue $\vec{\lambda}_2^{v*}$: \[ \vec{\lambda}_2^{v*}
\lesssim \vec{\psi}(G) \lesssim \sqrt{\vec{\lambda}_2^{v*} \cdot \log
(\Delta/\vec{\lambda}_2^{v*})}. \] This provides a combinatorial
characterization of the fastest mixing time of a directed graph by vertex
expansion, and builds a new connection between reweighted eigenvalued, vertex
expansion, and fastest mixing time for directed graphs.
  The second main result is a stronger Cheeger inequality relating the edge
conductance $\vec{\phi}(G)$ of a directed graph $G$ to the edge-capacitated
maximum reweighted second eigenvalue $\vec{\lambda}_2^{e*}$: \[
\vec{\lambda}_2^{e*} \lesssim \vec{\phi}(G) \lesssim \sqrt{\vec{\lambda}_2^{e*}
\cdot \log (1/\vec{\lambda}_2^{e*})}. \] This provides a certificate for a
directed graph to be an expander and a spectral algorithm to find a sparse cut
in a directed graph, playing a similar role as Cheeger's inequality in
certifying graph expansion and in the spectral partitioning algorithm for
undirected graphs.
  We also use this reweighted eigenvalue approach to derive the improved
Cheeger inequality for directed graphs, and furthermore to derive several
Cheeger inequalities for hypergraphs that match and improve the existing
results in [Lou15,CLTZ18]. These are supporting results that this provides a
unifying approach to lift the spectral theory for undirected graphs to more
general settings.

in healthcare is complicated by the issue of confounding medical interventions
(CMI): when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse
event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and
alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict. A simple approach is
to ignore CMI and monitor only the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain
unaltered. In general, ignoring CMI may inflate Type I error because (i)
untreated patients disproportionally represent those with low predicted risk
and (ii) evolution in both the model and clinician trust in the model can
induce complex dependencies that violate standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we
show that valid inference is still possible if one monitors conditional
performance and if either conditional exchangeability or time-constant
selection bias hold. Specifically, we develop a new score-based cumulative sum
(CUSUM) monitoring procedure with dynamic control limits. Through simulations,
we demonstrate the benefits of combining model updating with monitoring and
investigate how over-trust in a prediction model may delay detection of

manipulations is essential to their deployment in the real world. Recently,
semantic manipulations of real images have been considered for this purpose, as
they may not arise using standard adversarial settings. However, such semantic
manipulations are often limited to style, color or attribute changes. While
expressive, these manipulations do not consider the full capacity of a
pretrained generator to affect adversarial image manipulations. In this work,
we aim at leveraging the full capacity of a pretrained image generator to
generate highly detailed, diverse and photorealistic image manipulations.
Inspired by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method
called Adversarial Pivotal Tuning (APT). APT first finds a pivot latent space
input to a pretrained generator that best reconstructs an input image. It then
adjusts the weights of the generator to create small, but semantic,
manipulations which fool a pretrained classifier. Crucially, APT changes both
the input and the weights of the pretrained generator, while preserving its
expressive latent editing capability, thus allowing the use of its full
capacity in creating semantic adversarial manipulations. We demonstrate that
APT generates a variety of semantic image manipulations, which preserve the
input image class, but which fool a variety of pretrained classifiers. We
further demonstrate that classifiers trained to be robust to other robustness
benchmarks, are not robust to our generated manipulations and propose an
approach to improve the robustness towards our generated manipulations. Code

determining the location and orientation of this coordinate frame on unseen

editing. To edit a real image using these state-of-the-art tools, one must
first invert the image with a meaningful text prompt into the pretrained
model's domain. In this paper, we introduce an accurate inversion technique and
thus facilitate an intuitive text-based modification of the image. Our proposed
inversion consists of two novel key components: (i) Pivotal inversion for
diffusion models. While current methods aim at mapping random noise samples to
a single input image, we use a single pivotal noise vector for each timestamp
and optimize around it. We demonstrate that a direct inversion is inadequate on
its own, but does provide a good anchor for our optimization. (ii) NULL-text
optimization, where we only modify the unconditional textual embedding that is
used for classifier-free guidance, rather than the input text embedding. This
allows for keeping both the model weights and the conditional embedding intact
and hence enables applying prompt-based editing while avoiding the cumbersome
tuning of the model's weights. Our Null-text inversion, based on the publicly
available Stable Diffusion model, is extensively evaluated on a variety of
images and prompt editing, showing high-fidelity editing of real images.

particularly for image-to-image generation tasks such as super-resolution and
inpainting. Current diffusion-based methods do not provide statistical
guarantees regarding the generated results, often preventing their use in
high-stakes situations. To bridge this gap, we construct a confidence interval
around each generated pixel such that the true value of the pixel is guaranteed
to fall within the interval with a probability set by the user. Since diffusion
models parametrize the data distribution, a straightforward way of constructing
such intervals is by drawing multiple samples and calculating their bounds.
However, this method has several drawbacks: i) slow sampling speeds ii)
suboptimal bounds iii) requires training a diffusion model per task. To
mitigate these shortcomings we propose Conffusion, wherein we fine-tune a
pre-trained diffusion model to predict interval bounds in a single forward
pass. We show that Conffusion outperforms the baseline method while being three
orders of magnitude faster.

a decade, with the possibility that it might be due to dark matter annihilation

investigates how the gamma-ray emission model ($\gamma$EM) used in Galactic
center analyses affects the interpretation of the GCE's nature. To address this
issue, we construct an ultra-fast and powerful inference pipeline based on
convolutional Deep Ensemble Networks. We explore the two main competing
hypotheses for the GCE using a set of $\gamma$EMs with increasing parametric
freedom. We calculate the fractional contribution ($f_{\mathrm{src}}$) of a dim
population of MSPs to the total luminosity of the GCE and analyze its
dependence on the complexity of the $\gamma$EM. For the simplest $\gamma$EM, we
obtain $f_{\mathrm{src}} = 0.10 \pm 0.07$, while the most complex model yields
$f_{\mathrm{src}} = 0.79 \pm 0.24.$ In conclusion, we find that the statement
about the nature of the GCE (dark matter or not) strongly depends on the
assumed $\gamma$EM. The quoted results for $f_{\mathrm{src}}$ do not account
for the additional uncertainty arising from the fact that the observed
gamma-ray sky is out-of-distribution concerning the investigated $\gamma$EM
iterations. We quantify the reality gap between our $\gamma$EMs using
deep-learning-based One-Class Deep Support Vector Data Description networks,
revealing that all employed $\gamma$EMs have gaps to reality. Our study casts
doubt on the validity of previous conclusions regarding the GCE and dark
matter, and underscores the urgent need to account for the reality gap and
consider previously overlooked ''out of domain'' uncertainties in future

proposed models can be high-dimensional and we employ the notion of basis
function expansions to provide an effective approach to dimension reduction.
The HGT component lends flexibility to our model to incorporate multi-type

degenerate wavefunctions. They are the building blocks of topological quantum
computing. However, experimental observation of non-Abelian anyons and their

experimentally that these twists follow the fusion rules and non-Abelian

ungapped localized excitations, the vortons, satisfying a dispersion $\omega
\propto k^2$ and carrying a vorticity dipole. The vortons are also
characterized by very distinctive derivative interactions whose structure is
fixed by symmetry. Departing from the original incompressible fluid, we
constructed a class of field theories where the vortons appear, right from the
start, as the quanta of either bosonic or fermionic local fields.

and dipolar molecules, the quantum simulation of lattice models with strongly
interacting dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and high densities is now within
experimental reach. This rapid development raises the issue about the validity
of quantum simulation in such regimes. In this study, we address this question
by performing a full quantitative comparison between the continuum description
of a one-dimensional gas of dipolar bosons in an optical lattice, and the
single-band Bose-Hubbard lattice model that it quantum simulates. By comparing
energies and density distributions, and by calculating direct overlaps between
the continuum and lattice many-body wavefunctions, we demonstrate that in
regimes of strong DDI and high densities the continuum system fails to recreate
the desired lattice model. Two-band Hubbard models become necessary to reduce
the discrepancy observed between continuum and lattice descriptions, but
appreciable deviations in the density profile still remain. Our study
elucidates the role of strong DDI in generating physics beyond lowest-band
descriptions and should offer a guideline for the calibration of near-term
dipolar quantum simulators.

by the interplay between the protostellar disk and the star's contraction. At
ages exceeding 100 million years (Myr), magnetic spin-down erases the initial
stellar spin rate and enables rotation-based age dating (gyrochronology). The
exact time at which the transition between these two regimes occurs depends on
stellar mass, and has been challenging to empirically resolve due to a lack of
viable calibration clusters. The $\alpha$ Persei open cluster ($t\approx80$
Myr, $d\approx170$ pc) may provide the needed calibrator, but recent analyses
of the Gaia data have provided wildly varying views of its age and spatial
extent. As such, we analyze a combination of TESS, Gaia, and LAMOST data to
calibrate gyrochronology at the age of $\alpha$ Per and to uncover the
cluster's true morphology. By assembling a list of rotationally-confirmed
$\alpha$ Per members, we provide strong evidence that $\alpha$ Per is part of a
larger complex of similarly-aged stars. Through kinematic back-integration, we
show that the most diffuse components of $\alpha$ Per were five times closer
together 50 Myr ago. Finally, we use our stellar rotation periods to derive a
relative gyrochronology age for $\alpha$ Per of 67 $\pm$ 12% the age of the
Pleiades, which yields 86 $\pm$ 16 Myr given current knowledge. We show that by
this age, stars more massive than $\approx$0.8 M$_{\odot}$ have converged to
form a well-defined slow sequence.

and 51 for Stock 20. Two-color diagrams were used to derive the reddening and
photometric metallicity for each cluster. The reddening for Berkeley 68 is
$E(B-V)=0.520 \pm 0.032$ and $0.400 \pm 0.048$ mag for Stock 20. Photometric
metallicity [Fe/H] is $-0.13 \pm 0.08$ dex for Berkeley 68, and $-0.01 \pm
0.06$ dex for Stock 20. Keeping as constant reddening and metallicity, we
determined the distance moduli and ages of the clusters through fitting
isochrones to the UBV and Gaia based color-magnitude diagrams. Photometric
distances are $d=3003 \pm 165$ pc for Berkeley 69 and $2911 \pm 216$ pc for
Stock 20. The cluster ages are $2.4 \pm 0.2$ Gyr and $50 \pm 10$ Myr for

found to be $\Gamma = 1.38 \pm 0.71$ and $\Gamma = 1.53 \pm 0.39$ for Berkeley

Salpeter (1955). The relaxation times were estimated as 32.55 Myr and 23.17 Myr
for Berkeley 68 and Stock 20, respectively. These times are less than the
estimated cluster ages, indicating that both clusters are dynamically relaxed.
Orbit integration was carried out only for Berkeley 68 since radial velocity

we examine the impact of quadratically-coupled ultralight dark matter on the
predictions of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The presence of ultralight dark matter
can modify the effective values of fundamental constants during Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis, modifying the predicted abundances of the primordial elements
such as Helium-4. We improve upon the existing literature in two ways: firstly,
we take into account the thermal mass acquired by the ultralight dark matter
due to its quadratic interactions with the Standard Model bath, which affects
the cosmological evolution of the dark matter. Secondly, we treat the weak
freeze-out using the full kinetic equations instead of using an instantaneous
approximation. Both improvements were shown to impact the Helium-4 prediction
in the context of universally-coupled dark matter in previous work. We extend
these lessons to more general couplings. We show that with these modifications,
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis provides strong constraints of ultralight dark matter
with quadratic couplings to the Standard Model for a large range of masses as
compared to other probes of this model, such as equivalence principle tests,
atomic and nuclear clocks, as well as astrophysical and other cosmological

goal is a comprehensive look at the physics of galaxy formation, including
stellar and black-hole feedback and flows of baryonic matter into and out of
galaxies. These processes are best studied in X-rays, and emission-line mapping
is the pressing need in this area. LEM will use a large microcalorimeter
array/IFU, covering a 30x30' field with 10"" angular resolution, to map the soft
X-ray line emission from objects that constitute galactic ecosystems. These
include supernova remnants, star-forming regions, superbubbles, galactic
outflows (such as the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way and their analogs
in other galaxies), the Circumgalactic Medium in the Milky Way and other
galaxies, and the Intergalactic Medium at the outskirts and beyond the confines
of galaxies and clusters. LEM's 1-2 eV spectral resolution in the 0.2-2 keV
band will make it possible to disentangle the faintest emission lines in those
objects from the bright Milky Way foreground, providing groundbreaking
measurements of the physics of these plasmas, from temperatures, densities,
chemical composition to gas dynamics. While LEM's main focus is on galaxy
formation, it will provide transformative capability for all classes of
astrophysical objects, from the Earth's magnetosphere, planets and comets to
the interstellar medium and X-ray binaries in nearby galaxies, AGN, and cooling
gas in galaxy clusters. In addition to pointed observations, LEM will perform a
shallow all-sky survey that will dramatically expand the discovery space.

nuclei (LLAGN) leaves behind a faint optical nuclear continuum whose nature has
been largely debated, mainly due to serious observational limitations in the IR
to UV range. We combine multi-wavelength sub-arcsecond resolution observations
-- able to isolate the genuine nuclear continuum -- with nebular lines in the
mid-IR, to indirectly probe the shape of the extreme UV continuum. We found
that 8 of the nearest prototype LLAGN are compatible with pure compact jet
emission (self-absorbed synchrotron plus the associated self-Compton component)
over more than ten orders of magnitude in frequency. When compared with typical
radio galaxies, the LLAGN continua show two peculiarities: $i)$ a very steep
spectral slope in the IR-to-optical/UV range ($-3.7 < \alpha_0 < -1.3$; $F_\nu
\propto \nu^{\alpha_0}$); and $ii)$ a very high turnover frequency ($0.2-30\,
\rm{THz}$; $1.3\,\rm{mm}-10\,\rm{\mu m}$). These attributes can be explained if
the synchrotron continuum is mainly dominated by thermalised particles at the
jet base or corona with considerably high temperatures, whereas only a small
fraction of the energy ($\sim 20\%$) would be distributed along the high-energy
power-law tail of accelerated particles. On the other hand, the nebular gas
excitation in LLAGN is in agreement with photo-ionisation from inverse Compton
radiation ($\alpha_{\rm x} \sim -0.7$), which would dominate the nuclear
continuum shortwards of $\sim 3000$ \r{A}. Our results suggest that the LLAGN
continuum can be dominated at all wavelengths by undeveloped jets, powered by a
thermalised particle distribution, similar to the behaviour observed in compact
jets of quiescent black hole X-ray binaries. This has important implications in
the context of galaxy evolution, since LLAGN may represent a major but
underestimated source of kinetic feedback in galaxies.

believed to be a crucial mechanism in several astrophysical processes, such as
formation of planets in protostellar discs, of molecular clouds in galactic
discs, and of stars in molecular clouds. Gravitational instability is fairly
well understood for infinitesimally thin discs. However, the thin-disc
approximation is not justified in many cases, and it is of general interest to
study the gravitational instability of rotating fluids with different degrees
of rotation support and stratification. We derive dispersion relations for
axisymmetric perturbations, which can be used to study the local gravitational
stability at any point of a rotating axisymmetric gaseous system with either
barotropic or baroclinic distribution. 3D stability criteria are obtained,
which generalize previous results and can be used to determine whether and
where a rotating system of given 3D structure is prone to clump formation. For
a vertically stratified gaseous disc of thickness $h_z$ (defined as containing
$\approx$70% of the mass per unit surface), a sufficient condition for local
gravitational instability is $Q_{\rm 3D}\equiv\left(\sqrt{\kappa^2+\nu^2}+c_s
h_z^{-1}\right)/{\sqrt{4\pi G\rho}}<1$, where $\rho$ is the gas volume density,
$\kappa$ the epicycle frequency, $c_s$ the sound speed, and $\nu^2\equiv\rho_z
p_z/\rho^2$, where $\rho_z$ and $p_z$ are the vertical gradients of,
respectively, gas density and pressure. The combined stabilizing effects of
rotation ($\kappa^2$) and stratification ($\nu^2$) are apparent. In unstable

Cancri), has now been observed in the optical for more than two decades.
Although it is thought to be a double degenerate binary undergoing mass
transfer, an early surprise was that its orbital frequency, $f_0$, is currently
increasing as the result of gravitational wave radiation. This is unusual since
it was expected that the mass donor was degenerate and would expand on mass
loss, leading to a decreasing $f_0$. We exploit two decades of high-speed
photometry to precisely quantify the trajectory of HM Cancri, allowing us to
find that $\ddot f_0$ is negative, where $\ddot
f_0~=~(-5.38\pm2.10)\times10^{-27}$ Hz s$^{-2}$. Coupled with our positive
frequency derivative, we show that mass transfer is counteracting
gravitational-wave dominated orbital decay and that HM Cancri will turn around
within $2100\pm800\,$yrs from now. We present Hubble Space Telescope
ultra-violet spectra which display Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption, indicative of the
presence of hydrogen accreted from the donor star. We use these pieces of
information to explore a grid of permitted donor and accretor masses with the
Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics suite, finding models in good
accordance with many of the observed properties for a cool and initially
hydrogen-rich extremely-low-mass white dwarf ($\approx0.17\,$M$_\odot$) coupled
with a high accretor mass white dwarf ($\approx 1.0\,$M$_\odot$). Our
measurements and models affirm that HM~Cancri is still one of the brightest
verification binaries for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna spacecraft.

implement measurements based on random ensembles of unitaries. Originally
derived for global Clifford unitaries and products of single-qubit Clifford
gates, practical implementations are limited to the latter scheme for moderate
numbers of qubits. Beyond local gates, the accurate implementation of very
short random circuits with two-local gates is still experimentally feasible
and, therefore, interesting for implementing measurements in near-term
applications. In this work, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for
shadow estimation using brickwork circuits with two layers of parallel
two-local Haar-random (or Clifford) unitaries. Besides the construction of the
classical shadow, our results give rise to sample-complexity guarantees for
estimating Pauli observables. We then compare the performance of shadow
estimation with brickwork circuits to the established approach using local
Clifford unitaries and find improved sample complexity in the estimation of
observables supported on sufficiently many qubits.

reionization remains to date largely unconstrained. Here we present JWST/NIRCam
imaging of the most highly magnified galaxy known at z ~ 6, the Sunrise arc. We
identify six young massive star clusters (YMCs) with measured radii spanning ~
20 pc down to ~ 1 pc (corrected for lensing magnification), estimated stellar
masses of ~ $10^{(6-7)}$ Msun, and with ages 1-30 Myr based on SED fitting to
photometry measured in 8 filters extending to rest-frame 7000A. The resulting
stellar mass surface densities are higher than 1000 Msun pc$^{-2}$ (up to a few
$10^5$ Msun pc$^{-2}$) and their inferred dynamical ages qualify the majority
of these systems as gravitationally-bound stellar clusters. The star cluster
ages map the progression of star formation along the arc, with to evolved
systems (>~ 10 Myr old) followed by very young clusters. The youngest stellar
clusters (< 5 Myr) show evidence of prominent Hbeta + [OIII]4959,5007 emission,
based on photometry, with equivalent widths larger than 1000 A rest-frame, and
are hosted in a 200 pc sized star-forming complex. Such a region dominates the
ionizing photon production, with a high efficiency log($\xi_{ion}$ [Hz
erg$^{-1}$]) ~ 25.7. A significant fraction of the recently formed stellar mass
of the galaxy (> 10-30 %) occurred in these YMCs. We speculate that such
sources of ionizing radiation boost the ionizing photon production efficiency
which eventually carve ionized channels that might favor the escape of Lyman
continuum radiation. The survival of some of the clusters would make them the
progenitors of massive and relatively metal-poor globular clusters in the local
Universe.

high-contrast imaging campaign of stars exhibiting proper motion changes
between Hipparcos and Gaia, and was also recently identified by Bonavita et al.
(2022) and Kuzuhara et al. (2022). Our Keck/NIRC2 and SCExAO/CHARIS imaging of
HIP~21152 revealed a comoving companion at a separation of
$0.37^{\prime\prime}$ (16 au). We perform a joint orbit fit of all available
relative astrometry and radial velocities together with the Hipparcos-Gaia
proper motions, yielding a dynamical mass of $24^{+6}_{-4}\,\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$,
which is $1{-}2{\sigma}$ lower than evolutionary model predictions. Hybrid
grids that include the evolution of cloud properties best reproduce the
dynamical mass. We also identify a comoving wide-separation
($1837^{\prime\prime}$ or $7.9 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{au}$) early-L dwarf with
an inferred mass near the hydrogen-burning limit. Finally, we analyze the
spectra and photometry of HIP~21152~B using the Saumon & Marley (2008)
atmospheric models and a suite of retrievals. The best-fit grid-based models
have $f_{\mathrm{sed}}=2$, indicating the presence of clouds,
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}=1400 \, \mathrm{K}$, and $\log{g}=4.5 \, \mathrm{dex}$. These
results are consistent with the object's spectral type of $\mathrm{T0\pm1}$. As
the first benchmark brown dwarf companion in the Hyades, HIP~21152~B joins the
small but growing number of substellar companions with well-determined ages and
dynamical masses.

positioning a single-antenna user in 3D space based on the received signal from
a single-antenna base station and reflected signal from an RIS by taking into
account the mobility of the user and spatial-wideband (WB) effects. To do so,
we first derive the spatial-WB channel model under the far-field assumption,
for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signal transmission with the
user having a constant velocity. We derive the Cramer Rao bounds to serve as a
benchmark. Furthermore, we devise a low-complexity estimator that attains the
bounds in high signal-to-noise ratios. Our estimator neglects the spatial-WB
effects and deals with the user mobility by estimating the radial velocities
and compensating for their effects in an iterative fashion. We show that the
spatial-WB effects can degrade the localization accuracy for large RIS sizes
and large signal bandwidths as the direction of arrival or departure deviate
from the RIS normal. In particular, for a 64X64 RIS, the proposed estimator is
resilient against the spatial-WB effects up to 140 MHz bandwidth. Regarding
user mobility, our results suggest that the velocity of the user influences
neither the bounds nor the accuracy of our estimator. Specifically, we observe
that the state of the user with a high speed (42 m/s) can be estimated
virtually with the same accuracy as a static user.

be caused by large-scale spiral-shaped density structures in the stellar wind.
We consider novel 3-D radiation-hydrodynamic models of rotating hot star winds

However, such claims are undermined by the fact that the specific aspects of

the question of what other aspects of the phenomenology of interference do in

that the most basic quantum wave-particle duality relation, which expresses the
precise trade-off between path distinguishability and fringe visibility, cannot
be reproduced in any noncontextual model. We do this by showing that it is a
specific type of uncertainty relation, and then leveraging a recent result
establishing that noncontextuality restricts the functional form of this

yield a safe set which has forward invariance property. In addition, the
proposed framework explicitly addresses control input constraints during the

learning a CBF for an nonlinear Moore Greitzer jet engine, where the system

personalize their care. In this work, we provide an answer to the following
research question: How to utilize machine learning to estimate probability of
relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer patients?
  Methods: For predicting relapse in 1,387 early-stage (I-II), non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from the Spanish Lung Cancer Group data (65.7
average age, 24.8% females, 75.2% males) we train tabular and graph machine
learning models. We generate automatic explanations for the predictions of such
models. For models trained on tabular data, we adopt SHAP local explanations to
gauge how each patient feature contributes to the predicted outcome. We explain
graph machine learning predictions with an example-based method that highlights
influential past patients. Results: Machine learning models trained on tabular
data exhibit a 76% accuracy for the Random Forest model at predicting relapse
evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation (model was trained 10 times with
different independent sets of patients in test, train and validation sets, the
reported metrics are averaged over these 10 test sets). Graph machine learning
reaches 68% accuracy over a 200-patient, held-out test set, calibrated on a
held-out set of 100 patients. Conclusions: Our results show that machine
learning models trained on tabular and graph data can enable objective,
personalised and reproducible prediction of relapse and therefore, disease
outcome in patients with early-stage NSCLC. With further prospective and
multisite validation, and additional radiological and molecular data, this
prognostic model could potentially serve as a predictive decision support tool
for deciding the use of adjuvant treatments in early-stage lung cancer.

set does not adequately cover all the settings where they are deployed.
Focusing on image classification, we consider the setting where we have an
error distribution $\mathcal{E}$ representing a deployment scenario where the
model fails. We have access to a small set of samples $\mathcal{E}_{sample}$
from $\mathcal{E}$ and it can be expensive to obtain additional samples. In the
traditional model development framework, mitigating failures of the model in
$\mathcal{E}$ can be challenging and is often done in an ad hoc manner. In this
paper, we propose a general methodology for model debugging that can
systemically improve model performance on $\mathcal{E}$ while maintaining its
performance on the original test set. Our key assumption is that we have access
to a large pool of weakly (noisily) labeled data $\mathcal{F}$. However,
naively adding $\mathcal{F}$ to the training would hurt model performance due
to the large extent of label noise. Our Data-Centric Debugging (DCD) framework
carefully creates a debug-train set by selecting images from $\mathcal{F}$ that
are perceptually similar to the images in $\mathcal{E}_{sample}$. To do this,
we use the $\ell_2$ distance in the feature space (penultimate layer
activations) of various models including ResNet, Robust ResNet and DINO where
we observe DINO ViTs are significantly better at discovering similar images
compared to Resnets. Compared to LPIPS, we find that our method reduces compute

alternative energy-momentum tensors that have been proposed to ameliorate known

resolution is to treat the continuum electromagnetic system as a subsystem and
add a phenomenological material subsystem energy-momentum tensor. We show that
the four-divergence of the total, electromagnetic plus material,

Adopting a new and
better social contract is usually challenging because the current one is
already widely adopted and stable due to deviants' sanctions. Thus, how does a
population shift from the current social contract to a better one? In other
words, how can a social system leave a local social optimum configuration to
achieve an optimum global state? Here, we investigate the effect of promoting
diversity on the evolution of social contracts. We considered group-structured
populations where individuals play the Stag-hunt game in all groups. We model
the diversity incentive as a Snow-drift game played in a single focus group
where the individual is more prone to adopt a deviant norm. We show that
moderate diversity incentives can change the system dynamics, leading the whole
population to move from the locally optimal social normal to the globally
optimal one. Thus, an initial fraction of adopters of the new norm can drive
the system toward the new social optimum norm. After the new social contract
becomes the new equilibrium, it remains stable even without the incentive. The
results are obtained using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical approximation
methods.

forces and torques on study samples, with magnitudes that allow the controlled

theoretical research has mostly focused on the study of forces and linear
momentum transfers from swift electrons (like those used in STEM) to
nanoparticles. However, theoretical research on the rotational aspects of the
interaction would benefit not only the development of electron tweezers, but
also other fields within electron microscopy such as electron vortices.
Starting from a classical-electrodynamics description, we present a theoretical
model, alongside an efficient numerical methodology, to calculate the angular
momentum transfer from a STEM swift electron to a spherical nanoparticle. We
show simulations of angular momentum transfers to aluminum, gold, and bismuth
nanoparticles of different sizes. We found that the transferred angular
momentum is always perpendicular to the system's plane of symmetry, displaying
a constant direction for all the cases considered. In the simulations, the
angular momentum transfer increased with the radius of the nanoparticle, but
decreased as the speed of the electron or the impact parameter increased. Also,
the electric contribution to the angular momentum transfer dominated over the
magnetic one, being comparable only for high electron's speeds (greater than
90% of the speed of light). Additionally, for nanoparticles with 1 nm radius of
the studied materials, we found validity criteria for the small-particle
approximation (in which the nanoparticle is modeled as an electric point
dipole). We believe that these findings contribute to the understanding of
rotational aspects present in STEM experiments, and might be useful for further
developments in electron tweezers and other electron microscopy related
techniques.

therefore arbitrarily close to having Poissonian pair correlations (which
corresponds to the case $\beta = \tfrac{1}{d}$). In this paper, we further
elaborate on the closeness of the two notions. We show that $d$-dimensional
Kronecker sequences for badly approximable vectors $\vec{\alpha}$ with an
arbitrary small uniformly distributed stochastic error term generically have
$\beta = \tfrac{1}{d}$-Poissonian pair correlations.

It is known that variable selection is practical in identifying significant

of charge of the battery used to power the vehicle. Accurate battery state
estimation requires nonlinear differential equations to be solved. This state
estimation is important in path planning to ensure flyable paths, however when
using MILPs to formulate the path planning problem these nonlinear equations
cannot be implemented. Poor accuracy in battery estimation during the path
planning runs the risk of the planned path being feasible by the estimation
model but in reality will deplete the battery to a critical level. To the end
of higher accuracy battery estimation within a MILP, we present here a simple
linear battery model which predicts the change in state-of-charge (SOC) of a
battery given a power draw and duration. This model accounts for changes in
battery voltage due to applied electrical load and changes in battery SOC. The
battery model is presented and then tested against alternate battery models in
numerical and in experimental tests. Further, the effect the proposed linear
model has over a simpler SOC estimation on the time-to-solve a resource

A comparator compares the input analog signal with the tracking window to

centered on the notion of reciprocal interactions between neurons and
astrocytes, which permitted a critical leap forward in uncovering many roles of
astrocytes in brain circuits, and signaled the rise of a major new force in
neuroscience: that of glial biology. In the past decade, a multitude of
unconventional and disparate functions of astrocytes have been documented that
are not predicted by these canonical models and that are challenging to piece
together into a holistic and parsimonious picture. This highlights a disconnect
between the rapidly evolving field of astrocyte biology and the conceptual
frameworks guiding it, and emphasizes the need for a careful reconsideration of
how we theorize the functional position of astrocytes in brain circuitry. Here,
we propose a unifying, highly transferable, data-driven, and
computationally-relevant conceptual framework for astrocyte biology, which we
coin contextual guidance. It describes astrocytes as contextual gates that
decode multiple environmental factors to shape neural circuitry in an adaptive,
state-dependent fashion. This paradigm is organically inclusive of all
fundamental features of astrocytes, many of which have remained unaccounted for
in previous theories. We find that this new concept provides an intuitive and
powerful theoretical space to improve our understanding of brain function and
computational models thereof across scales because it depicts astrocytes as a
hub for circumstantial inputs into relevant specialized circuits that permits
adaptive behaviors at the network and organism level.

computational and memory costs. To reduce the costs, first-order
(computationally efficient) and asynchronous-parallel (memory efficient)
algorithms are necessary to minimize non-convex functions in machine learning.
However, asynchronous-first-order methods applied within non-convex settings
run into two difficulties: (i) parallelization delays, which affect convergence
by disrupting the monotonicity of first-order methods, and (ii) sub-optimal
saddle points where the gradient is zero. To solve these two difficulties, we
propose an asynchronous-coordinate-gradient-descent algorithm shown to converge
to local minima with a bounded delay. Our algorithm overcomes
parallelization-delay issues by using a carefully constructed Hamiltonian
function. We prove that our designed kinetic-energy term, incorporated within
the Hamiltonian, allows our algorithm to decrease monotonically per iteration.
Next, our algorithm steers iterates clear of saddle points by utilizing a
perturbation sub-routine. Similar to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms,
we achieve a poly-logarithmic convergence rate with respect to dimension.
Unlike other SOTA algorithms, which are synchronous, our work is the first to
study how parallelization delays affect the convergence rate of asynchronous
first-order algorithms. We prove that our algorithm outperforms synchronous
counterparts under large parallelization delays, with convergence depending
sublinearly with respect to delays. To our knowledge, this is the first local
optima convergence result of a first-order asynchronous algorithm for
non-convex settings.

dependent state variable can be differentiated with respect to the topology,
thus leading to a linearised system resembling those occurring in standard
optimal control problems. However, a lot of care has to be taken when handling
the regularity of the solutions of this linearised system. In fact, we should
expect different notions of (very) weak solutions, depending on whether the
main part of the operator or its lower order terms are being perturbed. We also
study the relationship with the topological state derivative, usually obtained
through classical topological expansions involving boundary layer correctors. A
feature of the topological state derivative is that it can either be derived
via Stampacchia-type regularity estimates or alternately with classical
asymptotic expansions. It should be noted that our approach is flexible enough
to cover more than the usual case of point perturbations of the domain. In
particular, and in the line of [8,9], we deal with more general dilatations of
shapes, thereby yielding topological derivatives with respect to curves,

applications such as spintronics and valleytronics. Here we report
magneto-transport experiments demonstrating how the valley degree of freedom
impacts the fractional quantum states (FQHSs), and the related
magnetic-flux-electron composite fermions (CFs), at very high magnetic fields
in the extreme quantum limit when only the lowest Landau level is occupied.
Unlike in other multivalley two-dimensional electron systems such as Si or
monolayer graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides, in our AlAs sample we
can continuously tune the valley polarization via the application of in-situ
strain. We find that the FQHSs remain exceptionally strong even as they make
valley polarization transitions, revealing a surprisingly robust ferromagnetism
of the FQHSs and the underlying CFs. Our observation implies that the CFs are
strongly interacting in our system. We are also able to obtain a phase diagram
for the FQHS and CF valley polarization in the extreme quantum limit as we
monitor transitions of the FHQSs with different valley polarizations.

different intermediate clusters of particles, known as subjets. The resulting
distribution of subjet connections is different for signal jets originating
from top quarks, whose subjets typically correspond to its three decay

technique to improve a well-performing model learned from large-scale data

focus on single domain adaptation, which neglects a more practical scenario
where training data are collected from multiple acoustic domains needed in
forensic scenarios. Audio analysis for forensic speaker recognition offers
unique challenges in model training with multi-domain training data due to
location/scenario uncertainty and diversity mismatch between reference and
naturalistic field recordings. It is also difficult to directly employ
small-scale domain-specific data to train complex neural network architectures
due to domain mismatch and performance loss. Fine-tuning is a commonly-used
method for adaptation in order to retrain the model with weights initialized
from a well-trained model. Alternatively, in this study, three novel adaptation
methods based on domain adversarial training, discrepancy minimization, and
moment-matching approaches are proposed to further promote adaptation
performance across multiple acoustic domains. A comprehensive set of
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that: 1) diverse acoustic environments
do impact speaker recognition performance, which could advance research in
audio forensics, 2) domain adversarial training learns the discriminative
features which are also invariant to shifts between domains, 3)
discrepancy-minimizing adaptation achieves effective performance simultaneously
across multiple acoustic domains, and 4) moment-matching adaptation along with
dynamic distribution alignment also significantly promotes speaker recognition
performance on each domain, especially for the LENA-field domain with noise

horizon discrete-time and continuous-time optimal control problems whose
dynamics are control-affine and whose cost is quadratic in the input. The
optimal control policy for this problem is the projection of minus the gradient
of the value function onto the space formed by all feasible control directions.
This projection points along the control direction of steepest decrease of the
value function. For discrete-time systems and a quadratic value function the
optimal control law can be obtained as the solution of a regularized least

step ahead. For the single input case and a quadratic value function the
solution for small weights in the control energy is interpreted as a control
policy that at each step brings the trajectories of the system as close as
possible to the origin, as measured by an appropriate norm. Conditions under
which the optimal control law is linear are also stated. Additionally, the
paper offers a mapping of the optimal control formulation to an equivalent
reinforcement learning formulation. Examples show the application of the

feedback control assuming that a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) has been
previously designed for the system. The main idea is to use a quadratic
candidate Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system parameterized by the
unique positive definite matrix that solves the Riccati equation. A converse
result will also be proved guaranteeing the existence of matrices verifying the
LMI if the system is static output feedback stabilizable. The proposed method
will then be extended to the design of static output feedback for the H1
control problem. Besides being a sufficient condition for which a converse
result is proved, there are another four main advantages of the proposed
methodology. First, it is computationally tractable. Second, one can use
weighting matrices and obtain a solution in a similar way to LQR design. Third,
the proposed method has an extremely simple LMI structure when compared with
other LMI methods proposed in the literature. Finally, for the cases where the
output is equal to the state it is shown that the LQR solution verifies the
proposed LMI. Therefore, the static output feedback includes the LQR solution
as a special case when the state is available, which is a desired property.
Several examples show that the method is consistently successful and works well
in practice.

crossover from two distinct quadrupolar states, both characterized by regular
tetrahedral patterns of surface topological defects, to either longitudinal,

densities. These transitions, along with the intermediary arrangements that
they involve, are attributed to the combination of orientational wetting with
subtle variations in their liquid-crystal (LC) elastic anisotropies. Our

technique that is unaffected by weather conditions. Deep Learning algorithms
can be applied to SAR data, but training them requires large labeled datasets.
In the case of landslides, these datasets are laborious to produce for
segmentation, and often they are not available for the specific region in which
the event occurred. Here, we study how deep learning algorithms for landslide
segmentation on SAR products can benefit from pretraining on a simpler task and
from data from different regions. The method we explore consists of two
training stages. First, we learn the task of identifying whether a SAR image
contains any landslides or not. Then, we learn to segment in a sparsely labeled
scenario where half of the data do not contain landslides. We test whether the
inclusion of feature embeddings derived from stage-1 helps with landslide
detection in stage-2. We find that it leads to minor improvements in the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve, but also to a significantly lower false
positive rate in areas without landslides and an improved estimate of the
average number of landslide pixels in a chip. A more accurate pixel count
allows to identify the most affected areas with higher confidence. This could
be valuable in rapid response scenarios where prioritization of resources at a

M7 science program. It will target a number of science cases in stellar physics
including the characterisation of star-planet interactions. The concept is
based on a 1-m class Ritchey-Chretien F/13 telescope mounted on an Ariel-type
platform. The scientific payload includes a common polarimetric unit and 2
spectrographs connected via a dichroic splitter. The polarimetric unit consists
of 6 MgF2 plates in pairs connected by optical contact and a Wollaston
analyzer. Each of the spectral channels represents an echelle spectrograph. The
first one will operate in the UV range 119-320 nm with the spectral resolving
power of R>25 000. It consists of an off-axis parabolic collimator, an echelle
grating in a quasi-Littrow mounting, a cross-disperser concave grating, and a
CMOS camera. The cross-disperser grating works also as a camera mirror and
represents a holographic grating recorded with aberrated wavefronts and on a
spherical substrate. The spectral image is projected onto a d-doped CMOS
detector. The second spectral channel operates in the visible range 350-888 nm
with R>35 000 and uses an immersed grating. The image is focused with a 4-lens
objective onto a CMOS detector. In addition, the optical design includes two
stages of fine-guiding system. The first stage represents a projecting system
tracking the image around the entrance pinhole and communicating with the
platform actuators. The second one is fed by the 0-th diffraction order of the
visible channel echelle. It is communicating with a tip-tilt mirror in front of
the dichroic. The first stage should improve the platform pointing accuracy
from 8"" to 200 mas precision to guarantee that the star images passes through
the instrument's entrance pinhole. The second stage should correct the pointing
accuracy further as well as some thermo-elastic deformations.

low-order plant (i.e. process) models are considered in this tutorial. The
first polynomial method finds the controller coefficients that place the poles
of the closed-loop feedback system at specified positions for adroit controls,
i.e. for a rapid and compressed transient response, when the plant model is
known precisely. The poles and zeros of the resulting controller are
unconstrainted, although an integrator may be included in the controller
structure as a special case to drive steady-state errors towards zero. The
second frequency method ensures that the feedback system has the desired
phase-margin at a specified gain cross-over frequency (for the desired
bandwidth) yielding robust stability with respect to plant model uncertainty.
The poles of the controller are at specified positions, e.g. for a standard
Proportional-Integral (PI), Proportional-Derivative (PD),
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), structure or other more general
configurations if necessary, and the problem is solved for the controller
zeros. The poles and zeros of the resulting closed-loop feedback system are
unconstrained. These complementary design procedures allow simple and effective
controls to be derived analytically from a plant model, using a matrix inverse
operation to solve a small set of linear simultaneous equations, as an
alternative to more heuristic (e.g. trial-and-error) or empirical PID-tuning
approaches. An azimuth controller for a pan-tilt-zoom camera mount is used as
an illustrative example. The ways in which both procedures may be used to
design controls with the desired balance between adroitness and robustness are
discussed.

propose a prompting-based strategy for extracting executable plans from an LLM,
which leverages a novel and readily-accessible source of information:
precondition errors. Our approach assumes that actions are only afforded
execution in certain contexts, i.e., implicit preconditions must be met for an
action to execute (e.g., a door must be unlocked to open it), and that the
embodied agent has the ability to determine if the action is/is not executable
in the current context (e.g., detect if a precondition error is present). When
an agent is unable to execute an action, our approach re-prompts the LLM with
precondition error information to extract an executable corrective action to
achieve the intended goal in the current context. We evaluate our approach in
the VirtualHome simulation environment on 88 different tasks and 7 scenes. We
evaluate different prompt templates and compare to methods that naively
re-sample actions from the LLM. Our approach, using precondition errors,
improves executability and semantic correctness of plans, while also reducing
the number of re-prompts required when querying actions.

separating transient (bursty) loop heating from the diffuse background (steady)
heating. We present a method of quantifying coronal heating's bursty and steady
components in ARs, applying it to FeXVIII (hot94) emission of an AR observed by
SDO/AIA. The maximum, minimum, and average brightness values for each pixel,
over a 24 hour period, yield a maximum-brightness map, a minimum-brightness
map, and an average-brightness map of the AR. Running sets of such three maps
come from repeating this process for each time step of running windows of 20,
16, 12, 8, 5, 3, 1 and 0.5 hours. From each running window's set of three maps,
we obtain the AR's three corresponding luminosity light curves. We find: (1)
The time-averaged ratio of minimum-brightness-map luminosity to
average-brightness-map luminosity increases as the time window decreases, and
the time-averaged ratio of maximum-brightness-map luminosity to
average-brightness-map luminosity decreases as the window decreases. (2) For
the 24-hour window, the minimum-brightness map's luminosity is 5% of the
average-brightness map's luminosity, indicating that at most 5% of the AR's
hot94 luminosity is from heating that is steady for 24 hours. (3) This upper
limit on the fraction of the hot94 luminosity from steady heating increases to
33% for the 30-minute running window. This requires that the heating of the
4--8 MK plasma in this AR is mostly in bursts lasting less than 30 minutes: at
most a third of the heating is steady for 30 minutes.

this paper, the traditional techniques of conventional astronomy are
reconsidered to properly utilise the event-based camera for space imaging and

used for calibrating an event-based camera for reliable and accurate

By calibrating sources detected using the event-based camera, the

related to the photometric characteristics of the underlying astrophysical

However, they have a high computational cost, which is cubic in the number of

Despite this increase in capability, most modern methods for the automatic

method for the detection of biological behaviours in videos. TempNet uses an
encoder bridge and residual blocks to maintain model performance with a
two-staged, spatial, then temporal, encoder. TempNet also presents temporal
attention during spatial encoding as well as Wavelet Down-Sampling
pre-processing to improve model accuracy. Although our system is designed for
applications to diverse fish behaviours (i.e, is generic), we demonstrate its
application to the detection of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) startle events.
We compare the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art end-to-end video
detection method (ReMotENet) and a hybrid method previously offered exclusively
for the detection of sablefish's startle events in videos from an existing
dataset. Results show that our novel method comfortably outperforms the
comparison baselines in multiple metrics, reaching a per-clip accuracy and
precision of 80% and 0.81, respectively. This represents a relative improvement
of 31% in accuracy and 27% in precision over the compared methods using this
dataset. Our computational pipeline is also highly efficient, as it can process
each 4-second video clip in only 38ms. Furthermore, since it does not employ
features specific to sablefish startle events, our system can be easily
extended to other behaviours in future works.

nanomaterials to attract investment for large-scale production, it is necessary
to clarify how physical properties relate to consumer demand. In this paper, we
show how density functional theory (DFT), a technique from computational
physics, can be integrated into econometrics to develop models for nanomaterial
market shares. Concretely, we study a simple discrete-choice model in which
consumers select one of two firms from which to purchase platinum catalyst
materials for hydrogen fuel cells. One of these firms produces an ordinary
material catalyst (platinum) and the other produces a nanomaterial catalyst
(monolayer platinum). Consumers make their selections according to hedonic
utility expressions, which depend upon the physical characteristics of the
materials in question. In turn, these physical characteristics can be
calculated using the DFT technique. As an application of our model, we show how
marginal production costs necessary for the nanomaterial catalyst to achieve a
particular market share can be inferred, thereby providing a means for
entrepreneurs to formulate cost targets for large-scale nanomaterial
production. Our model, which can be generalised beyond the situation considered
here, represents the first step towards the unification of econometrics and
computational physics, an intellectual advancement which may facilitate future
efforts at nanomaterial commercialisation.

making use of depth-wise recurrent networks. We show that a broad class of
architectures named equilibrium models display strong upwards generalization,
and find that stronger performance on harder examples (which require more
iterations of inference to get correct) strongly correlates with the path
independence of the system -- its tendency to converge to the same steady-state
behaviour regardless of initialization, given enough computation. Experimental
interventions made to promote path independence result in improved
generalization on harder problem instances, while those that penalize it
degrade this ability. Path independence analyses are also useful on a
per-example basis: for equilibrium models that have good in-distribution
performance, path independence on out-of-distribution samples strongly
correlates with accuracy. Our results help explain why equilibrium models are
capable of strong upwards generalization and motivates future work that
harnesses path independence as a general modelling principle to facilitate

temporal and spectral averages for speckle reduction, it is extremely
challenging to reconstruct high-homogeneity, edge-sharp and shape-unlimited
images via holography. Here we predict that holographic speckles can be removed
by narrowing the probability density distribution of encoded phase to
homogenize optical superposition. Guided by this physical insight, a
machine-learning-assisted probability-shaping (MAPS) method is developed to
prohibit the fluctuations of intensity in a computer-generated hologram (CGH),
which empowers the experimental reconstruction of irregular images with
ultralow speckle contrast (C=0.08) and record-high edge sharpness (~1000 mm-1).
It breaks the ultimate barrier of demonstrating high-end CGH lithography, thus
enabling us to successfully pattern arbitrary-shape and edge-sharp structures

linearly independent subset of rows or columns (a basis), solving linear
regression, or computing a subspace embedding. For these problems, we consider
input matrices $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ with $n > d$. The input
can be read in $\text{nnz}(\mathbf{A})$ time, which denotes the number of
nonzero entries of $\mathbf{A}$. In this paper, we show that beyond the time
required to read the input matrix, these fundamental linear algebra problems
can be solved in $d^{\omega}$ time, i.e., where $\omega \approx 2.37$ is the
current matrix-multiplication exponent.
  To do so, we introduce a constant-factor subspace embedding with the optimal
$m=\mathcal{O}(d)$ number of rows, and which can be applied in time
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\text{nnz}(\mathbf{A})}{\alpha}\right) + d^{2 +

sampling, we use fast semidefinite programming to reweight the rows. We then
use our constant-factor subspace embedding to give the first optimal runtime
algorithms for finding a maximal linearly independent subset of columns,

subroutine that iteratively grows a set of independent rows, which may be of

hydrodynamical simulations of Illustris, IllustrisTNG and SIMBA. By comparing
to the observed atomic and molecular neutral hydrogen measurements for central
galaxies, we find that Illustris over-predicts the cold gas masses in
star-forming galaxies and significantly under-predicts them for quenched
galaxies. IllustrisTNG performs better in this comparison than Illustris, but
quenched galaxies retain too much cold gas compared with observations. SIMBA
shows good agreement with observations, by depleting the global cold gas
reservoir for quenched galaxies. We find that the discrepancies in IllustrisTNG
are caused by its weak kinetic AGN feedback that only redistributes the cold
gas from the inner disks to the outer regions and reduces the inner cold gas
densities. It agrees with observations much better when only the cold gas
within the stellar disk is considered to infer the star formation rates. From
dependences of cold gas reservoir on the black hole mass and Eddington ratio,
we find that the cumulative energy release during the black hole growth is the
dominant reason for the cold gas depletion and thus the galaxy quenching. We
further measure the central stellar surface density within 1 kpc ($\Sigma_1$)
for the high-resolution run of IllustrisTNG and find a tight correlation
between $\Sigma_1$ and black hole mass. It suggests that the observed
decreasing trend of cold gas mass with $\Sigma_1$ is also a reflection of the
black hole growth.

extreme metastability of diamond at very high pressures has been discovered in
recent dynamic compression experiments. This work addresses an important
question about the existence of other competitive metastable carbon phases that
might be observed in shock experiments. It was found that diamond polytypes,
carbon crystals with mixed cubic and hexagonal diamond stacking planes, are the
only metastable carbon crystal phases energetically competitive with cubic
diamond at pressures between 100 and 1,000 GPa. Above 1 TPa, no metastable
phases are found to be energetically competitive with thermodynamically stable
BC8 and simple cubic phases. The existence of low enthalpy diamond polytypes
suggests that they are likely candidates for metastable phases of carbon to
appear upon shockwave loading of diamond.

foundational training: (1) Realistic trainers and simulators: Representative

This paper introduces a new term encompassing the variables of space maneuver

Interoperable Software Tools: Adapt to new software tools without reliance on a

audio-visual events (AVEs). Given a video, we aim to localize video segments

discriminative features for each video segment. Unlike existing work focusing
on audio-visual feature fusion, in this paper, we propose a new contrastive
positive sample propagation (CPSP) method for better deep feature
representation learning. The contribution of CPSP is to introduce the available
full or weak label as a prior that constructs the exact positive-negative
samples for contrastive learning. Specifically, the CPSP involves comprehensive
contrastive constraints: pair-level positive sample propagation (PSP),
segment-level and video-level positive sample activation (PSA$_S$ and PSA$_V$).
Three new contrastive objectives are proposed (\emph{i.e.},
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{avpsp}}$, $\mathcal{L}_\text{spsa}$, and
$\mathcal{L}_\text{vpsa}$) and introduced into both the fully and weakly
supervised AVE localization. To draw a complete picture of the contrastive
learning in AVE localization, we also study the self-supervised positive sample
propagation (SSPSP). As a result, CPSP is more helpful to obtain the refined
audio-visual features that are distinguishable from the negatives, thus
benefiting the classifier prediction. Extensive experiments on the AVE and the
newly collected VGGSound-AVEL100k datasets verify the effectiveness and
generalization ability of our method.

this paper, we explore how ensemble methods can improve recent SSL techniques
by developing a framework that permits data-dependent weighted cross-entropy

yields an efficient ensemble method that incurs a small training cost and
requires no architectural changes or computational overhead to downstream

ImageNet-1K, particularly in the few-shot setting. We explore several weighting

distribution in a galaxy. We treat the galaxy as a one-zone object and include
five main processes (stellar dust production, dust destruction in supernova
shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by
shattering). In this paper, we improve the predictions related to small
carbonaceous grains, which are responsible for the 2175 \AA\ bump in the
extinction curve and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission
features in the dust emission spectral energy distribution (SED), both of which
were underpredicted in our previous model. In the new model, we hypothesize
that small carbonaceous grains are not involved in interstellar processing.
This avoids small carbonaceous grains being lost by coagulation. We find that
this hypothetical model shows a much better match to the Milky Way (MW)
extinction curve and dust emission SED than the previous one. The following two
additional modifications further make the fit to the MW dust emission SED
better: (i) The chemical enrichment model is adjusted to give a nearly solar
metallicity in the present epoch, and the fraction of metals available for dust
growth is limited to half. (ii) Aromatization for small carbonaceous grains is
efficient, so that the aromatic fraction is unity at grain radii $\lesssim 20$
\AA. As a consequence of our modelling, we succeed in obtaining a dust
evolution model that explains the MW extinction curve and dust emission SED at
the same time.

focus on small and non-isolated traffic subsystems, while the Traffic4cast 2022

the congestion classes for all road segments and the expected times of arrival
along super-segments 15 minutes into the future. The sparsity of loop counter
data and highly uncertain real-time traffic conditions make the competition
challenging. For this reason, we propose a multi-task learning network that can
simultaneously predict the congestion classes and the speed of each road
segment. Specifically, we use clustering and neural network methods to learn
the dynamic features of loop counter data. Then, we construct a graph with road
segments as nodes and capture the spatial dependence between road segments
based on a Graph Neural Network. Finally, we learn three measures, namely the
congestion class, the speed value and the volume class, simultaneously through
a multi-task learning module. For the extended competition, we use the
predicted speeds to calculate the expected times of arrival along

incorporates particle-tracking from TeV to eV energies using a combination of
GEANT4 and a custom low-energy particle generation and tracking code. The
electrostatic environment of the test mass is simulated allowing for a
comparison of the test-mass charging-rate dependence on local electric fields
with observations made in orbit. The model is able to reproduce the observed
charging behavior with good accuracy using gold surface properties compatible
with literature values. The results of the model confirm that a significant
fraction of the net charging current is caused by a population of low-energy
($\sim$eV) electrons produced by electron- and ion-induced kinetic emission
from the test mass and surrounding metal surfaces. Assuming a gold work
function of 4.2 eV, the unbalanced flow of these electrons to and from the
unbiased test mass contributes $\sim$10% of the overall test mass charging
rate. Their contribution to the charging-current shot noise is
disproportionately higher and it adds $\sim$40% to the overall predicted noise.
However, even with this increased noise contribution the overall
charging-current noise is still only 40% of that measured in-orbit, and this
remains an unsolved issue.

employ (a) the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms
(DAVE4VM) to determine the photospheric fluxes of energy and helicity, and (b)
non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations to estimate the coronal
content of energy and helicity in source-region fields. Using Superposed Epoch
analysis (SPE), we find, on average: (1) decreases in both magnetic energy and
helicity, in both photospheric fluxes and coronal content, that persist for a
few hours after eruptions, but no clear changes, notably in relative helicity,
for confined events; (2) significant increases in the twist of photospheric
fields in eruptive events, with twist uncertainties too large in confined
events to constrain twist changes (and lower overall twist in confined events);
and (3) on longer time scales (event time +12 hours), replenishment of free
magnetic energy and helicity content to near pre-event levels for eruptive
events. For eruptive events, magnetic helicity and free energy in coronal
models clearly decrease after flares, with the amounts of decrease proportional
to each region's pre-flare content.

is close to a non-collapsed Riemannian manifold of lower dimension. The

  Our construction of a nilpotent fibration requires a new proof for a result

$M$ is diffeomorphic to an infra-nilmanifold. The proof in [HKRX] is to show
that the Ricci flows produces an almost flat metric, thus the result follows

independent of the Gromov's theorem, thus has which as a corollary. If the

feature both a wide observing field of view and true imaging capability,
promising sky monitoring with significantly improved sensitivity and spatial
resolution in soft X-rays. Since first proposed by Angel (1979), the optics
have been extensively studied, developed and trialed over the past decades. In
this Letter, we report on the first-light results from a flight experiment of
the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy ($LEIA$), a pathfinder of the wide-field
X-ray telescope of the Einstein Probe mission. The piggyback imager, launched
in July 2022, has a mostly un-vignetted field of view of $18.6^\circ \times
18.6^\circ $. Its spatial resolution is in the range of 4$-$7 arcmin in FWHM
and the focal spot effective area is 2$-$3 cm$^2$, both showing only mild
fluctuations across the field of view. We present images of the Galactic center
region, Sco X-1 and the diffuse Cygnus Loop nebular taken in snapshot
observations over 0.5$-$4 keV. These are truly wide-field X-ray images of
celestial bodies observed, for the first time, by a focusing imaging telescope.
Initial analyses of the in-flight data show excellent agreement between the
observed images and the on-ground calibration and simulations. The instrument
and its characterization are briefly described, as well as the flight
experiment. The results provide a solid basis for the development of the
present and proposed wide-field X-ray missions using lobster eye MPO.

and the imbalance of observed confounders in IV regression and aims at unbiased
causal effect estimation. Recently, nonlinear IV estimators were proposed to
allow for nonlinear model in both stages. However, the observed confounders may
be imbalanced in stage 2, which could still lead to biased treatment effect
estimation in certain cases. To this end, we propose a Confounder Balanced IV
Regression (CB-IV) algorithm to jointly remove the bias from the unmeasured
confounders and the imbalance of observed confounders. Theoretically, by
redefining and solving an inverse problem for potential outcome function, we
show that our CB-IV algorithm can unbiasedly estimate treatment effects and
achieve lower variance. The IV methods have a major disadvantage in that little
prior or theory is currently available to pre-define a valid IV in real-world
scenarios. Thus, we study two more challenging settings without pre-defined
valid IVs: (1) indistinguishable IVs implicitly present in observations, i.e.,
mixed-variable challenge, and (2) latent IVs don't appear in observations,
i.e., latent-variable challenge. To address these two challenges, we extend our
CB-IV by a latent-variable module, namely CB-IV-L algorithm. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our CB-IV(-L) outperforms the existing approaches.

well known, the investigation of the asymptotic properties is far behind,
leading to difficulties in developing more precise $k$-means methods in

spin qubits in silicon an attractive platform for quantum computing. In recent
years, hole spin qubits are being developed as they have the advantages of weak

constructing high-fidelity quantum gates. However, there are relatively few
studies on the hole spin qubits in a single acceptor, which requires only low
density of the metallic gates. In particular, the investigation of flexible
tunability using controllable strain for fault-tolerant quantum gates of
acceptor-based qubits is still lacking. Here, we study the tunability of
electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) of acceptor-based hole spin qubits with
controllable strain. The flexible tunability of LH-HH splitting and spin-hole
coupling (SHC) with the two kinds of strain can avoid high electric field at
the ""sweet spot"", and the operation performance of the acceptor qubits could be
optimized. Longer relaxation time or stronger EDSR coupling at low electric
field can be obtained. Moreover, with asymmetric strain, two ""sweet spots"" are
induced and may merge together, and form a second-order ""sweet spot"". As a
result, the quality factor $Q$ can reach $10^{4}$ for single-qubit operation,
with high tolerance for the electric field variation. Furthermore, the
two-qubit operation of acceptor qubits based on dipole-dipole interaction is
discussed for high-fidelity two-qubit gates. The tunability of spin qubit
properties in acceptor via strain could provide promising routes for spin-based

the cytoskeleton in-vitro. They are composed of a polymer network (backbone),
swollen by the presence of a liquid solvent, and active molecules (molecular
motors, MMs) that transduce chemical energy into the mechanical work of
contraction. These motors attach to the polymer chains to shorten them and/or
act as dynamic crosslinks, thereby constraining the thermal fluctuation of the
chains. We describe both mechanisms thermodynamically as a microstructural
reconfiguration, where the backbone stiffens to motivate solvent (out)flow and
accommodate contraction. Via simple steady-state energetic analysis, under the
simplest case of isotropic contraction, we quantify the mechanical energy
required to achieve contraction as a function of polymer chain density and
molecular motor density. We identify two limit cases, (fm) fast MM activation
for which MMs provide all the available mechanical energy instantaneously and
leave the polymer in a stiffened state, i.e. their activity occurs at a time
scale that is much smaller than solvent diffusion, and (sm) slow MM activation
for which the MM activation timescale is much longer. To achieve the same final
contracted state, fm requires the largest amount of work per unit reference
volume, while sm requires the least. For all intermediate cases where the
timescale of MM activation is comparable with that of solvent flow, the
required work ranges between the two cases. We provide all these quantities as
a function of chain density and MM density. Finally, we compare our results

systems with many antennas. We propose low-resolution multiuser MIMO receivers
where the signals are simultaneously processed by 1-bit ADCs and a comparator
network, which can be interpreted as additional virtual channels with binary
outputs. We distinguish the proposed comparator networks in fully and partially
connected. For such receivers, we develop the low-resolution aware linear
minimum mean-squared error (LRA-LMMSE) channel estimator and detector according
to the Bussgang theorem. We also develop a robust detector which takes into
account the channel state information (CSI) mismatch statistics. By exploiting
knowledge of the channel coefficients we devise a mean-square error (MSE)
greedy search and a sequential signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
search for optimization of partially connected networks. Numerical results show
that a system with extra virtual channels can outperform a system with
additional receive antennas, in terms of bit error rate (BER). Furthermore, by
employing the proposed channel estimation with its error statistics, we
construct a lower bound on the ergodic sum rate for a linear receiver.
Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms the
conventional 1-bit MIMO system in terms of BER, MSE and sum rate.

The first generator takes at input the underwater image and predicts the
dewatered scene, while the second generator learns the underwater image

affecting KG-related downstream tasks. Detecting errors in KGs is challenging
since the patterns of errors are unknown and diverse, while ground-truth labels
are rare or even unavailable. A traditional solution is to construct logical
rules to verify triples, but it is not generalizable since different KGs have
distinct rules with domain knowledge involved. Recent studies focus on
designing tailored detectors or ranking triples based on KG embedding loss.
However, they all rely on negative samples for training, which are generated by
randomly replacing the head or tail entity of existing triples. Such a negative
sampling strategy is not enough for prototyping practical KG errors, e.g.,
(Bruce_Lee, place_of_birth, China), in which the three elements are often
relevant, although mismatched. We desire a more effective unsupervised learning
mechanism tailored for KG error detection. To this end, we propose a novel
framework - ContrAstive knowledge Graph Error Detection (CAGED). It introduces
contrastive learning into KG learning and provides a novel way of modeling KG.
Instead of following the traditional setting, i.e., considering entities as
nodes and relations as semantic edges, CAGED augments a KG into different
hyper-views, by regarding each relational triple as a node. After joint
training with KG embedding and contrastive learning loss, CAGED assesses the
trustworthiness of each triple based on two learning signals, i.e., the
consistency of triple representations across multi-views and the
self-consistency within the triple. Extensive experiments on three real-world
KGs show that CAGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in KG error detection.

training and target domain meta testing. Specifically, in the meta-training
stage, we design and train two separate convolutional neural network (CNN)
modules on the source domain dataset to fully capture the implicit amplitude
and phase features of CSI measurements related to human activities. A
subsequent knowledge distillation procedure is designed to iteratively update
the CNN parameters for better generalization performance. In the meta-testing

a private item $X_i$ from a size-$d$ domain and a server aims to estimate the
empirical frequency (i.e., histogram) of $n$ items with $n \ll d$. Without any
security and privacy considerations, each user can communicate its item to the
server by using $\log d$ bits. A naive application of secure aggregation
protocols would, however, require $d\log n$ bits per user. Can we reduce the
communication needed for secure aggregation, and does security come with a
fundamental cost in communication?
  In this paper, we develop an information-theoretic model for secure
aggregation that allows us to characterize the fundamental cost of security and
privacy in terms of communication. We show that with security (and without
privacy) $\Omega\left( n \log d \right)$ bits per user are necessary and
sufficient to allow the server to compute the frequency distribution. This is
significantly smaller than the $d\log n$ bits per user needed by the naive
scheme, but significantly higher than the $\log d$ bits per user needed without
security. To achieve differential privacy, we construct a linear scheme based
on a noisy sketch which locally perturbs the data and does not require a
trusted server (a.k.a. distributed differential privacy). We analyze this
scheme under $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ loss. By using our
information-theoretic framework, we show that the scheme achieves the optimal
accuracy-privacy trade-off with optimal communication cost, while matching the
performance in the centralized case where data is stored in the central server.

to be crucial to the realisation of large-scale quantum algorithms that could
lead to extremely impactful scientific or commercial results. Achieving a
universal set of quantum gate operations in a fault-tolerant error-corrected
framework suffers from a `conservation of unpleasantness'. In general, no
matter what error correction technique is employed, there is always one element
of a universal gate set that carries a significant resource overhead - either
in physical qubits, computational time, or both. Specifically, this is due to
the application of non-Clifford gates. A common method for realising these
gates for stabiliser codes such as the surface code is a combination of three
protocols: state injection, distillation and gate teleportation. These
protocols contribute to the resource overhead compared to logical operations
such as a CNOT gate and contributes to the qubit resources for any
error-corrected quantum algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a very simple
protocol to potentially reduce this overhead for non-Clifford gates:
Transversal Injection. Transversal injection modifies the initial physical
states of all data qubits in a stabiliser code before standard encoding and
results in the direct preparation of a large class of single qubit states,
including resource states for non-Clifford logic gates. Preliminary results
hint at high quality fidelities at larger distances and motivate further
research on this technique.

algebraic geometry and Bayesian statistics in the last two decades. Many
statistical models and learning machines which contain hierarchical structures
or latent variables are called nonidentifiable, because the map from a
parameter to a statistical model is not one-to-one. In nonidentifiable models,
both the likelihood function and the posterior distribution have singularities
in general, hence it was difficult to analyze their statistical properties.
However, from the end of the 20th century, new theory and methodology based on
algebraic geometry have been established which enables us to investigate such
models and machines in the real world. In this article, the following results
in recent advances are reported. First, we explain the framework of Bayesian
statistics and introduce a new perspective from the birational geometry.
Second, two mathematical solutions are derived based on algebraic geometry. An
appropriate parameter space can be found by a resolution map, which makes the
posterior distribution be normal crossing and the log likelihood ratio function
be well-defined. Third, three applications to statistics are introduced. The
posterior distribution is represented by the renormalized form, the asymptotic
free energy is derived, and the universal formula among the generalization
loss, the cross validation, and the information criterion is established. Two
mathematical solutions and three applications to statistics based on algebraic
geometry reported in this article are now being used in many practical fields
in data science and artificial intelligence.

anomaly detection method is proposed to integrate the spatiotemporal

detection is realized according to the difference between the output frame and
the true value. In order to strengthen the characteristic information
connection between continuous video frames, the residual temporal shift module
and the residual channel attention module are introduced to improve the
modeling ability of the network on temporal information and channel
information, respectively. Due to the excessive generalization of convolutional
neural networks, in the memory enhancement modules, the hopping connections of
each codec layer are added to limit autoencoders' ability to represent abnormal
frames too vigorously and improve the anomaly detection accuracy of the
network. In addition, the objective function is modified by a feature
discretization loss, which effectively distinguishes different normal behavior
patterns. The experimental results on the CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech datasets
show that the proposed method is superior to the current mainstream video
anomaly detection methods while meeting the real-time requirements.

We are concerned here with likelihood ratio tests in the $\beta$-model for

specified null $H_0: \beta_i=\beta_i^0$ for $i=1,\ldots, r$ and a homogenous
null $H_0: \beta_1=\cdots=\beta_r$, we reveal high dimensional Wilks' phenomena
that the normalized log-likelihood ratio statistic,
$[2\{\ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) -
\ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^0)\} - r]/(2r)^{1/2}$, converges in
distribution to the standard normal distribution as $r$ goes to infinity. Here,
$\ell( \boldsymbol{\beta})$ is the log-likelihood function on the vector

$\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under
the full parameter space, and $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^0$ is the

Leveraging the contrastive losses, we propose three metrics featuring a

With features pre-trained on the image classification task, the metrics can
already yield high-quality importance scores, demonstrating competitive or
better performance than past heavily-trained methods. We show that by refining
the pre-trained features with a lightweight contrastively learned projection

given to unsupervised methods for defect detection. Although existing
reconstruction-based methods have been widely studied recently, establishing a

remains a challenging task due to homogeneous and nonregular surface textures.
In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised reconstruction-based method
called the normal reference attention and defective feature perception network
(NDP-Net) to accurately inspect a variety of textured defects. Unlike most
reconstruction-based methods, our NDP-Net first employs an encoding module that
extracts multi scale discriminative features of the surface textures, which is
augmented with the defect discriminative ability by the proposed artificial
defects and the novel pixel-level defect perception loss. Subsequently, a novel

features of the fixed reference image to repair the defective features and
restrain the reconstruction of the defects. Next, the repaired features are fed
into a decoding module to reconstruct the normal textured background. Finally,
the novel multi scale defect segmentation module (MSDSM) is introduced for
precise defect detection and segmentation. In addition, a two-stage training
strategy is utilized to enhance the inspection performance.

industry such as asset tracking, resource monitoring and automation. As
security mechanisms are often neglected during the deployment of IoT devices,
they are more easily attacked by complicated and large volume intrusion attacks
using advanced techniques. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used by the
cyber security community in the past decade to automatically identify such
attacks. However, deep learning methods have yet to be extensively explored for
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) specifically for IoT. Most recent works are
based on time sequential models like LSTM and there is short of research in
CNNs as they are not naturally suited for this problem. In this article, we
propose a novel solution to the intrusion attacks against IoT devices using
CNNs. The data is encoded as the convolutional operations to capture the
patterns from the sensors data along time that are useful for attacks detection
by CNNs. The proposed method is integrated with two classical CNNs: ResNet and
EfficientNet, where the detection performance is evaluated. The experimental
results show significant improvement in both true positive rate and false
positive rate compared to the baseline using LSTM.

Given that MYSOs were previously identified based on the extended structure and
the observational data for them is limited, screening the Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE) objects showing green features (for the common coding of
the 4.6 $\mu$m band as green channel in three-color composite WISE images) will
yield more MYSO candidates. Using WISE images in the whole Galactic Plane ($
0^\circ<l<360^\circ $ and $\mid b \mid <2^\circ$), we identified sources with
strong emissions at 4.6 $\mu$m band, then according to morphological features
divided them into three groups. We present a catalog of 2135 WISE Green Objects
(WGOs). 264 WGOs have an extended structure. 1366 WGOs show compact green
feature but without extended structure. 505 WGOs have neither extended
structure nor green feature, but the intensity at 4.6 $\mu$m is numerically at
least 4.5 times that of 3.4 $\mu$m. According to the analysis of the
coordinates of WGOs, we find WGOs are mainly distributed in $\mid l \mid<
60^\circ$, coincident with the position of the giant molecular clouds in $\mid
l \mid> 60^\circ$. Matching results with various masers show that those three
groups of WGOs are at different evolutionary stages. After cross-matching WGOs
with published YSO survey catalogs, we infer that $\sim$50% of WGOs are samples
of newly discovered YSOs. In addition, 1260 WGOs are associated with Hi-GAL
sources, according to physical parameters estimated by spectral energy
distribution fitting, of which 231 are classified as robust MYSOs and 172 as
candidate MYSOs.

the glass transition is considered a critical finding in the quest to
understand the physics of glass formation. These understandings helped us
understand various dynamical phenomena observed in supercooled liquids. It is
known that at least two different length scales exist - one is of thermodynamic
origin, while the other is dynamical in nature. Recent observations of glassy
dynamics in biological and synthetic systems where the external or internal
driving source controls the dynamics, apart from the usual thermal noise, led
to the emergence of the field of active matter. A question of whether the
physics of glass formation in these active systems is also accompanied by
growing dynamic and static lengths is indeed timely. In this article, we probe
the growth of dynamic and static lengths in a model active glass system using
rod-like elongated probe particles, an experimentally viable method. We show
that the dynamic and static lengths in these non-equilibrium systems grow much
more rapidly than their passive counterparts. We then offer an understanding of
the violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation and Stokes-Einstein-Debye
relation using these lengths via a scaling theory.

Though GAN based models seem promising, there has been a lack of purpose built

performance-oriented, data-generating strategy that utilizes a new
architecture, coined draGAN, to generate both minority and majority samples.
The samples are generated with the objective of optimizing the classification
model's performance, rather than similarity to the real data. We benchmark our
approach against state-of-the-art methods from the SMOTE family and competitive
GAN based approaches on 94 tabular datasets with varying degrees of imbalance

well defined on such Riemannian manifolds and enjoy strong theoretical

sliced-Wasserstein distances, which leverage a closed-form of the Wasserstein

readily available on hyperbolic spaces. In this work, we propose to derive
novel hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein discrepancies. These constructions use

(GC) of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) is strongly coupled to gas
transport properties, thereby affecting the electrochemical conversion rates.
In this study, the GDL and GC regions are utilized as the simulation domain,
which differs from previous studies that only focused on any one of them. A
volume-of-fluid method is adopted to numerically investigate the two-phase flow
(gas and liquid) behavior, e.g., water transport pattern evolution, water
coverage ratio as well as local and total water saturation. To obtain GDL
geometries, an in-house geometry-based method is developed for GDL
reconstruction. Furthermore, to study the effect of GDL carbon fiber diameter,
the same procedure is used to reconstruct three GDL structures by varying the
carbon fiber diameter but keeping the porosity and geometric dimensions
constant. The wall wettability is introduced with static contact angles at
carbon fiber surfaces and channel walls. The results show that the GDL fiber
microstructure has a significant impact on the two-phase flow patterns in the
cathode field. Different stages of two-phase flow pattern evolution in both
cathode domains are observed. Due to the difference in wettability, the water
coverage of the GDL/GC interface is smaller than that of the channel side and
top walls. It is also found that the water saturation inside the GDLs
stabilizes after the water breakthrough, while local water saturation at the
interface keeps irregular oscillations. Last but not the least, a water

Many algorithms have been proposed for this critical task. However, most of
them consider the learning algorithms for directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
Bayesian network (BN). These BN-based models only have limited causal
explainability because of the issue of Markov equivalence class. Moreover, they
are dependent on the assumption of stationarity, whereas many sampling time
series from complex system are nonstationary. The nonstationary time series
bring dataset shift problem, which leads to the unsatisfactory performances of
these algorithms. To fill these gaps, a novel causation model named Unique
Causal Network (UCN) is proposed in this paper. Different from the previous
BN-based models, UCN considers the influence of time delay, and proves the
uniqueness of obtained network structure, which addresses the issue of Markov
equivalence class. Furthermore, based on the decomposability property of UCN, a
higher-order causal entropy (HCE) algorithm is designed to identify the
structure of UCN in a distributed way. HCE algorithm measures the strength of
causality by using nearest-neighbors entropy estimator, which works well on
nonstationary time series. Finally, lots of experiments validate that HCE
algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy when time series are
nonstationary, compared to the other baseline algorithms.

from binary neutron star mergers could be detected in a 10-year observation of
the Einstein Telescope and the THESEUS satellite mission. Based on this mock

Compared with the traditional EM observational data such as CMB, BAO, and SN

stringent cosmological fits. We find that the GW data could play a more
important role for determining the interaction in the models with $Q=3 \beta H

actuarial sciences. As a result, a number of goodness-of-fit tests have been
proposed for these distributions in the literature. We provide an overview of
the existing tests for the Pareto distribution, focussing specifically on the
Pareto type I distribution. To date, only a single overview paper on
goodness-of-fit testing for Pareto distributions has been published. However,
the mentioned paper has a much wider scope than is the case for the current
paper as it covers multiple types of Pareto distributions. The current paper
differs in a number of respects. First, the narrower focus on the Pareto type I
distribution allows a larger number of tests to be included. Second, the
current paper is concerned with composite hypotheses compared to the simple
hypotheses (specifying the parameters of the Pareto distribution in question)
considered in the mentioned overview. Third, the sample sizes considered in the
two papers differ substantially.
  In addition, we consider two different methods of fitting the Pareto Type I
distribution; the method of maximum likelihood and a method closely related to
moment matching. It is demonstrated that the method of estimation has a
profound effect, not only on the powers achieved by the various tests, but also
on the way in which numerical critical values are calculated. We show that,
when using maximum likelihood, the resulting critical values are shape
invariant and can be obtained using a Monte Carlo procedure. This is not the
case when moment matching is employed.
  The paper includes an extensive Monte Carlo power study. Based on the results
obtained, we recommend the use of a test based on the phi divergence together
with maximum likelihood estimation.

deformation is of paramount importance in many areas, such as foods,
pharmaceuticals, solid-liquid separations, cosmetics, aerogels and drug
delivery. Most of the understanding of the elasticity of gel materials is based
on the concept of fractal scaling with very little microscopic insights.
Previous experimental observations strongly suggest that the gel material loses
the fractal correlations upon deformation and the range of packing fraction up
to which the fractal scaling can be applied is very limited. Also, correctly
implementing the fractal modeling requires identifying the elastic backbone,
which is a formidable task. So far, there is no clear understanding of the gel
elasticity at high packing fraction and the correct length scale that governs
its mechanical response. In this work, we undertake extensive numerical
simulations to elucidate the different aspects of stress transmission in the
gel materials. We observe the existence of two percolating networks of
compressive and tensile normal forces close to the gel point. We also find that
the probability distribution for the compressive and tensile part normalized by
their respective mean shows universal behavior irrespective of varied
interaction potential, thermal energy and particle size distribution.
Interestingly, there are also large number of contacts with zero normal force,
and consequently, a peak in the normal force distribution is observed at
$f_n\approx0$ even at higher pressure. We also identify the critical internal
state parameters such as mean normal force, force anisotropies and the average
coordination number and propose simple constitutive relations that relate the
different components of the stress to the internal state parameters. The
agreement between our model prediction and the simulation observation is
excellent.

DCT coefficients of JPEG image can form an embedding domain that is robust to

modification on the robustness, the modified DCT coefficients of the stego
image after TCM will change after recompression. To reduce the number of
changed coefficients after recompression, this paper proposes a robust
steganography algorithm which dynamically updates the robustness cost of every

the modified DCT coefficient can resist recompression in every step of STC
embedding process. By adding robustness cost to the distortion cost and using
the framework of STC embedding algorithm to embed the message, the stego images
have good performance both in robustness and security. The experimental results

information. The first, originally proposed in a lesser-known work by Claude
Shannon, describes how the information content of channels can be described
qualitatively, but still abstractly, in terms of information elements, i.e.
equivalence relations over the data source domain. Shannon showed that these
elements form a complete lattice, with the order expressing when one element is
more informative than another. In the context of security and information flow
this structure has been independently rediscovered several times, and used as a
foundation for reasoning about information flow.
  The second theory of information is Dana Scott's domain theory, a
mathematical framework for giving meaning to programs as continuous functions
over a particular topology. Scott's partial ordering also represents when one
element is more informative than another, but in the sense of computational
progress, i.e. when one element is a more defined or evolved version of
another.
  To give a satisfactory account of information flow in programs it is
necessary to consider both theories together, to understand what information is
conveyed by a program viewed as a channel (\`a la Shannon) but also by the
definedness of its encoding (\`a la Scott). We combine these theories by
defining the Lattice of Computable Information (LoCI), a lattice of preorders
rather than equivalence relations. LoCI retains the rich lattice structure of
Shannon's theory, filters out elements that do not make computational sense,
and refines the remaining information elements to reflect how Scott's ordering
captures the way that information is presented.
  We show how the new theory facilitates the first general definition of
termination-insensitive information flow properties, a weakened form of
information flow property commonly targeted by static program analyses.

This is often the result of the reward for a good action only being available
after other agents have taken theirs, and these actions are not credited
accordingly. Recurrent neural networks have proven to be a viable solution
strategy for solving these types of problems, resulting in significant
performance increase when compared to other methods. In this paper, we explore
a different approach and focus on the experiences used to update the
action-value functions of each agent. We introduce the concept of
credit-cognisant rewards (CCRs), which allows an agent to perceive the effect
its actions had on the environment as well as on its co-agents. We show that by
manipulating these experiences and constructing the reward contained within
them to include the rewards received by all the agents within the same action
sequence, we are able to improve significantly on the performance of

utilized in solving low-vision tasks recently, e.g., rain removal and
super-resolution. Stereo image restoration methods usually obtain better
performance than monocular methods by learning the disparity between dual views
either implicitly or explicitly. However, existing stereo rain removal methods
still cannot make full use of the complementary information between two views,
and we find it is because: 1) the rain streaks have more complex distributions
in directions and densities, which severely damage the complementary
information and pose greater challenges; 2) the disparity estimation is not
accurate enough due to the imperfect fusion mechanism for the features between
two views. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new \underline{Stereo}
\underline{I}mage \underline{R}ain \underline{R}emoval method (StereoIRR) via
sufficient interaction between two views, which incorporates: 1) a new
Dual-view Mutual Attention (DMA) mechanism which generates mutual attention
maps by taking left and right views as key information for each other to
facilitate cross-view feature fusion; 2) a long-range and cross-view
interaction, which is constructed with basic blocks and dual-view mutual
attention, can alleviate the adverse effect of rain on complementary
information to help the features of stereo images to get long-range and
cross-view interaction and fusion. Notably, StereoIRR outperforms other related
monocular and stereo image rain removal methods on several datasets. Our codes
and datasets will be released.

  by Masked Image Modeling",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a mainstream direction in
automatic machine learning. Since the discovery that original DARTS will
inevitably converge to poor architectures, recent works alleviate this by
either designing rule-based architecture selection techniques or incorporating
complex regularization techniques, abandoning the simplicity of the original
DARTS that selects architectures based on the largest parametric value, namely
$\alpha$. Moreover, we find that all the previous attempts only rely on
classification labels, hence learning only single modal information and
limiting the representation power of the shared network. To this end, we
propose to additionally inject semantic information by formulating a patch
recovery approach. Specifically, we exploit the recent trending masked image
modeling and do not abandon the guidance from the downstream tasks during the
search phase. Our method surpasses all previous DARTS variants and achieves
state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet without complex
manual-designed strategies.

spatial and temporal dynamics are often shaped by movement patterns of

visual features. In this paper, we address small target motion detection
problem by developing a visual system with spatio-temporal feedback loop, and
further reveal its important roles in suppressing false positive background
movement while enhancing network responses to small targets. Specifically, the
proposed visual system is composed of two complementary subnetworks. The first
subnetwork is designed to extract spatial and temporal motion patterns of
cluttered backgrounds by neuronal ensemble coding. The second subnetwork is
developed to capture small target motion information and integrate the
spatio-temporal feedback signal from the first subnetwork to inhibit background
false positives. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
spatio-temporal feedback visual system is more competitive than existing
methods in discriminating small moving targets from complex dynamic

may have suboptimal behaviour on binary constraints -- this is detrimental from
an AI perspective where binary constraints are predominant in, for instance,
spatiotemporal applications. In response to this, we introduce sidedoors as an

explains, by respecting representative solid-phase element abundances,
simultaneously the typical wavelength-dependent reddening, extinction, and
emission of polarized and unpolarized light by interstellar dust particles
between far UV and millimetre wavelengths. The physical properties of dark dust
are derived. Dark dust consists of micrometre-sized particles, which have been
recently detected in-situ. It provides significant wavelength-independent
reddening from the far UV to the near-infrared. Light absorbed by dark dust is
re-emitted in the submillimeter region by grains at dust temperatures of 8-12K.
Such very cold dust has been frequently observed in external galaxies. Dark
dust contributes to the polarisation at greater than about 1 mm to ~35% and at

Open Domain Question Answering, largely by leveraging their decoder to attend
over multiple encoded passages and combining their information. However,
generative models tend to be larger than extractive models due to the need for
a decoder, run slower during inference due to auto-regressive decoder beam
search, and their generated output often suffers from hallucinations. We
propose to extend transformer encoders with the ability to fuse information
from multiple passages, using global representation to provide cross-sample
attention over all tokens across samples. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative answer span probability calculation to better aggregate answer
scores in the global space of all samples. Using our proposed method, we
outperform the current state-of-the-art method by $2.5$ Exact Match score on
the Natural Question dataset while using only $25\%$ of parameters and $35\%$
of the latency during inference, and $4.4$ Exact Match on WebQuestions dataset.
When coupled with synthetic data augmentation, we outperform larger models on
the TriviaQA dataset as well. The latency and parameter savings of our method
make it particularly attractive for open-domain question answering, as these
models are often compute-intensive.

the position of the DOMs, which are not static due to the sea currents, must be

Positioning System, which is composed of fixed acoustic emitters on the sea
bottom, a hydrophone in each DU base, and a piezoceramic sensor in each DOM, as
acoustic receivers. This network of acoustic sensors can be used not only for

ship noise monitoring, environmental noise control, and acoustic neutrinos
detection. This work explores the possibility of creating a trigger for saving
the data for ultra-high-energy neutrino candidates detected acoustically by the
hydrophones. The acoustic signal caused by the neutrino interaction in a fluid

astronomical objects through photometry. A challenge to derive accurate
photometry is that narrow-band filters are based on interference of multiple
reflections and refractions between thin layers of transparent dielectric
material. When the light rays reach the surface of a filter not perpendicular
to it, they cross the layers obliquely travelling a path longer than the
thickness of the layers and different for each inclination. This results in a
blue-shift of the central wavelength and a distortion of the transmission
curve. Hence, particular care should be taken when narrow band filters are used
in presence of small f-numbers and large non-telecentric angles, as frequent in
the large field of view (FoV) instruments. Sometimes, the broadening and
central wavelength shift of the transmission curve are considered and
compensated in the design of filters for instruments with a small f-number.
Here we consider the combined effect of small f-number, non-telecentricity and
large FoV. Where single spectral lines are considered, a shift in central
wavelength or a change in the shape of the transmission curve may introduce an
instrumental dispersion in luminosity and in the linked color indices. We found
that transmission curves of narrow band filters can be significantly different
in shape than the nominal ones. The bottom limits for filters' effective FWHM
for each f-number; the monotonic behavior of the blue-shift with distance from
the center of FoV; the monotonic quality decrease of the transmission curves
and the photometric dispersion introduced by the filters are computationally
estimated. This work could represent a useful tool to evaluate the fitness of a
particular filter at a particular facility.

their spectral evolution in a bolometric luminosity range of 1\%--15\%$L_{\rm

are consistent well, which implies that the accretion disk is close to the NS
surface. For the decay stage, we report a steep change of the accretion disk
emission within one day, i.e., the soft-to-hard transition, which could be due
to the propeller effect and the corresponding neutron star surface magnetic
field is 1.8--2.2$\times10^{8}$ G. Moreover, the inner disk radius is truncated
at the corotation radius, which is similar to the propeller effect detected
from 4U~1608--52. The absence of the propeller effect in the hard-to-soft state

constrain the initial stages after a heavy-ion collision makes imperative to
have a better understanding of the process of medium-induced radiation before
the formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and its impact on observables at
high-$p_T$. In this work, we generalize the BDMPS-Z framework for
medium-induced radiation to account for additional emissions occurring before
the creation of the QGP. For simplicity, we assume that during the
pre-hydrodynamics phase the hard parton propagates as in vacuum. This set-up,
allows us to isolate the contribution from the additional initial radiation by
comparing with the usual scenarios in which the emitter is created inside the
medium but with different starting points. Using both a numerical
implementation of the fully resummed emission spectrum and the usual analytical
approximations, we find that replacing an initial slab of the medium by vacuum
yields to a significant reduction of the emission spectrum for low radiated
gluon energies, while the high-energy tails remain largely unmodified. Finally,
we assess the effect of replacing the initial medium by vacuum propagation on
the single-inclusive particle suppression $R_{AA}$ and high-$p_T$ azimuthal
asymmetry $v_2$. Our findings indicate that considering vacuum propagation
prior to hydrodynamization leads to an increase in the $v_2$, thus
corroborating the importance of the treatment of jet quenching in the initial
stages for the correct description of both observables.

high-energy stellar radiation affects atmospheric evolution, we account for the
entire range of possible stellar rotation histories. To set the planetary
parameters at formation, we use analytical approximations based on formation
models. Finally, we build a grid of synthetic planets with parameters
reflecting those of the observed distribution. The predicted radius spread
reproduces well the observed MR distribution, except for two distinct groups of
outliers (~20% of the population). The first one consists of close-in
Saturn-mass planets with Jupiter-like radii for which we underpredict the
radius likely because it lacks additional heating similar to that responsible
for inflation in hot Jupiters. The second group consists of warm sub-Neptunes,
which should host massive primordial H-dominated atmospheres, but instead
present high densities indicative of small gaseous envelopes. This suggests
that their formation, internal structure, and evolution are different from that
of atmospheric evolution through the escape of H-dominated envelopes accreted
onto rocky cores. The observed characteristics of low-mass planets (<10-15Me)
strongly depend on the impact of atmospheric escape, and thus on the evolution
of the host star, while primordial parameters are less relevant. Instead, for
more massive planets, the parameters at formation play the dominant role in

has been the subject of much attention in recent years. This is due to the
excellent results obtained on a variety of subsequent tasks (in particular
classification), without requiring a large amount of labeled samples. However,
most reference CL algorithms (such as SimCLR and MoCo, but also BYOL and Barlow
Twins) are not adapted to pixel-level downstream tasks. One existing solution
known as PixPro proposes a pixel-level approach that is based on filtering of
pairs of positive/negative image crops of the same image using the distance
between the crops in the whole image. We argue that this idea can be further
enhanced by incorporating semantic information provided by exogenous data as an
additional selection filter, which can be used (at training time) to improve
the selection of the pixel-level positive/negative samples. In this paper we
will focus on the depth information, which can be obtained by using a depth
estimation network or measured from available data (stereovision, parallax
motion, LiDAR, etc.). Scene depth can provide meaningful cues to distinguish
pixels belonging to different objects based on their depth. We show that using
this exogenous information in the contrastive loss leads to improved results
and that the learned representations better follow the shapes of objects. In
addition, we introduce a multi-scale loss that alleviates the issue of finding
the training parameters adapted to different object sizes. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our ideas on the Breakout Segmentation on Borehole Images
where we achieve an improvement of 1.9\% over PixPro and nearly 5\% over the
supervised baseline. We further validate our technique on the indoor scene
segmentation tasks with ScanNet and outdoor scenes with CityScapes ( 1.6\% and

microfluidic chip that follows the concept of glass capillary micropipette
aspiration in order to quantify the viscoelastic behavior of spheroids in an
easy- to-handle, high-throughput manner. Spheroids are loaded in parallel
pockets via a gentle flow, after which spheroid tongues are aspirated into
adjacent aspiration channels using hydrostatic pressure. After each experiment,
the spheroids are easily removed from the chip by reversing the pressure and
new spheroids can be injected. The presence of multiple pockets with a uniform
aspiration pressure, combined with the ease to conduct successive experiments,
allows for a high throughput of tens of spheroids per day. We demonstrate that
the chip provides accurate deformation data when working at different
aspiration pressures. Lastly, we measure the viscoelastic properties of
spheroids made of different cell lines and show how these are consistent with
previous studies using established experimental techniques. In summary, our
chip provides a high-throughput way to measure the viscoelastic deformation

in the weak spatial inhomogeneity of the electromagnetic field on the atomic
scale. In molecules, such effects are well described by the multipole theory of
electromagnetism, where the coupling to light is treated semiclassically beyond
the electric-dipole approximation. That theory has two shortcomings: it is
limited to bounded systems, and its building blocks - the multipole transition
moments - are origin dependent. In this work, we recast the multipole theory in
a translationally-invariant form that remains valid for crystals. Working in
the independent-particle approximation, we introduce ""intrinsic"" multipole
transition moments that are origin independent and transform covariantly under
gauge transformations of the Bloch eigenstates. Electric-dipole transitions are
given by the interband Berry connection, while magnetic-dipole and
electric-quadrupole transitions are described by matrix generalizations of the
intrinsic magnetic moment and quantum metric. In addition to multipole-like
terms, the response of crystals at first order in the wavevector of light
contains band-dispersion terms that have no counterpart in molecular theories.
The full response is broken down into magnetoelectric and quadrupolar parts,
which can be isolated in the static limit where electric and magnetic fields
become decoupled. The rotatory-strength sum rule for crystals is found to be
equivalent to the topological constraint for a vanishing chiral magnetic effect
in equilibrium, and the formalism is validated by numerical tight-binding
calculations.

parameter $\lambda$ over two orders of magnitude, effectively varying the mass
of radiated particles $m_H \sim \sqrt{\lambda}$. We perform an in-depth
investigation into the effects of AMR on massive radiation emission, including
radiation trapping and the refinement required to resolve high frequency modes.
We use quantitative diagnostic tools to determine the eigenmode decomposition,
showing a complex superposition of high frequency propagating modes with
different phase and group velocities. We conclude that massive radiation is
generally strongly suppressed relative to the preferred massless channel, with
suppression increasing at lower amplitudes and higher $\lambda$. Only in
extreme nonlinear regimes (e.g.\ with relative amplitude $\varepsilon \sim 1.5$
and $\lambda < 1$) do we observe massive and massless radiation to be emitted
at comparable magnitude. We find that massive radiation is emitted in distinct
high harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the string, and we demonstrate
that, for the sinusoidal configurations studied, massive radiation is
exponentially suppressed with $\sqrt{\lambda}$ (i.e. the particle mass).
Finally, we place these results in the context of axions and gravitational
waves produced by cosmological cosmic string networks, and note that AMR
provides a significant opportunity to explore higher $\lambda$ (thin string)
regimes whilst using fewer computational resources.

complex robot-environment interactions. Soft robotic manipulators, or slender
continuum structure robots have the potential to exploit these interactions to
enable new exploration and manipulation capabilities and safe human-robot
interactions. However, the interactions, or perturbations by external forces
cause the soft structure to deform in an infinite degree of freedom (DOF)
space. To control such system, reduced order models are needed; typically
models consider piecewise sections of constant curvature although external
forces often deform the structure out of the constant curvature hypothesis. In
this work we perform an analysis of the trade-off between computational
treatability and modelling accuracy. We then propose a new kinematic model, the
Piecewise Affine Curvature (PAC) which we validate theoretically and
experimentally showing that this higher-order model better captures the
configuration of a soft continuum body robot when perturbed by the external
forces. In comparison to the current state of the art Piecewise Constant
Curvature (PCC) model we demonstrate up to 30\% reduction in error for the end
position of a soft continuum body robot.

Ejections, fast solar wind streams, and solar energetic particles are among the
most relevant events in Space Weather. Moreover, solar flares are the most
energetic processes that occur in our solar system. The in-depth study of their
occurrence statistics, both over extended periods or during individual solar
cycles, allows us to improve and constrain the basic physical models of their
origin. Increasing the number of detected events, especially those of lower
intensity, and the number of physical parameters that describe the detected
flares is, therefore, a mandatory goal. In this paper, we present a
computationally efficient algorithm for the detection of solar flares in the
soft-X solar flux provided by the GOES (NASA/NOAA) satellite constellation. Our
code produces a new flare catalogue increasing the number of events with
respect to the official GOES list. In addition to increasing the number of
identified events, the catalogue contains information such as: an estimate of
the total energy released, start and end time of the event, possible overlap
with other events, background level of the GOES X-ray emission close to the
revealed event. After a detailed description of the detection algorithm, we
carry out a preliminary analysis of the flares reported in our catalogue and
compare our results with the official list of GOES for the period from 1998 to

contrast using Born data, including the full aperture, limited-aperture, and
multi-frequency data. We propose a class of data-driven basis for these inverse
problems based on the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions and related
eigenfunctions. Such data-driven eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of a Fourier
integral operator; they remarkably extend analytically to the whole space, are
doubly orthogonal, and are complete in the class of band-limited functions. We
first establish a Picard criterion for reconstructing the contrast using the
data-driven basis, where the reconstruction formula can also be understood in
the viewpoint of data processing and analytic extrapolation. Another salient
feature associated with the generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions is
that the data-driven basis for a disk is also a basis for a Sturm-Liouville
differential operator. With the help of Sturm-Liouville theory, we estimate the
$L^2$ approximation error for a spectral cutoff approximation of $H^s$

noisy data and an explicit stability estimate for contrast in $H^s$ ($0<s\le1$)

shuffling and remixing the separated signals. The solver then separates the
pseudo-mixtures and remixes the separated signals back to the observed

need to consider their inflexibility to meet sudden peaks in demand. It is
therefore important to reduce the peak load placed on our energy system. For
individual households this means spreading out the use of high-powered
appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, throughout the day.
Traditional approaches to this problem have relied on differential pricing set
by a centralised utility company, but this mechanism has not been effective in
promoting widespread shifting of appliance usage. Our previous research
investigated a decentralised mechanism where agents receive an initial
allocation of time-slots to use their appliances, which they can then exchange
with other agents. This was found to be an effective approach to reducing the
peak load within a community energy system when we introduced social capital,
the tracking of favours given and received, in order to incentivise agents to
act flexibly by accepting exchanges that do not immediately benefit them. This
system encouraged self-interested agents to learn socially beneficial behaviour
in order to earn social capital that they could later use to improve their own
performance. In this paper we expand this work by implementing real world
household appliance usage data in order to ensure that our mechanism could
adapt to the challenging demand needs of real households. We also demonstrate
how smaller and more diverse populations can optimise more effectively than
larger community energy systems and better overcome the challenges of
real-world demand peaks.

this work, we address the above problem and the very relevant aspect of
sub-slice reuse among different services. Further, unlike prior art, we account
for the services' finite lifetime and time-varying traffic load. We identify
two major sources of inefficiency in service management: (i) the overspending
of computing resources due to traffic of multiple services with different
latency requirements being processed by the same virtual machine (VM), and (ii)
the poor packing of traffic processing requests in the same VM, leading to
opening more VMs than necessary. To cope with the above issues, we devise an

  Attacks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2202.02242",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Machine learning (ML) models have been deployed for high-stakes applications,
e.g., healthcare and criminal justice. Prior work has shown that ML models are
vulnerable to attribute inference attacks where an adversary, with some
background knowledge, trains an ML attack model to infer sensitive attributes
by exploiting distinguishable model predictions. However, some prior attribute
inference attacks have strong assumptions about adversary's background
knowledge (e.g., marginal distribution of sensitive attribute) and pose no more
privacy risk than statistical inference. Moreover, none of the prior attacks
account for class imbalance of sensitive attribute in datasets coming from
real-world applications (e.g., Race and Sex). In this paper, we propose an
practical and effective attribute inference attack that accounts for this
imbalance using an adaptive threshold over the attack model's predictions. We
exhaustively evaluate our proposed attack on multiple datasets and show that
the adaptive threshold over the model's predictions drastically improves the
attack accuracy over prior work. Finally, current literature lacks an effective
defence against attribute inference attacks. We investigate the impact of
fairness constraints (i.e., designed to mitigate unfairness in model
predictions) during model training on our attribute inference attack. We show
that constraint based fairness algorithms which enforces equalized odds acts as
an effective defense against attribute inference attacks without impacting the
model utility. Hence, the objective of algorithmic fairness and sensitive
attribute privacy are aligned.

matter-antimatter asymmetry in the observable Universe. These particles can be
produced in the decay of hadrons typically produced in a neutrino beamline used
for oscillation experiments, and have sufficient lifetime to propagate to a
near detector, where they decay to observable particles. For the approximation
of a single new mass eigenstate mixing with the Standard Model via the lepton
mixing matrix, a simulation framework based on the GENIE event generator has
been developed. This module is designed to facilitate searches for HNL through
a unified, minimal interface employing a detailed treatment of the kinematics
and dynamics of massive unstable neutrinos, with a transparently organised
suite of physics effects tracking the HNL from its production to its decay.
These mechanisms are expounded on in the current work, underlining the rich
landscape for novel, non-trivial physics that has already been identified in

have virial ratios smaller than 2, and can be classified as gravitationally
bound cores. The derived core mass function (CMF) for bound starless cores
which are not associate with protostars has a slope similar to Salpeter's
initial mass function (IMF) for the mass range above 1 $M_\odot$, with a peak
at $\sim$ 0.1 $M_\odot$. We divide the cloud into four parts based on the
declination, OMC-1/2/3, OMC-4/5, L1641N/V380 Ori, and L1641C, and derive the
CMFs in these regions. We find that starless cores with masses greater than 10
$M_\odot$ exist only in OMC-1/2/3, whereas the CMFs in OMC-4/5, L1641N, and
L1641C are truncated at around 5--10 $M_\odot$. From the number ratio of bound
starless cores and Class II objects in each subregion, the lifetime of bound
starless cores is estimated to be 5--30 free-fall times, consistent with
previous studies for other regions. In addition, we discuss core growth by mass
accretion from the surrounding cloud material to explain the coincidence of
peak masses between IMFs and CMFs. The mass accretion rate required for
doubling the core mass within a core lifetime is larger than that of
Bondi-Hoyle accretion by a factor of order 2. This implies that more dynamical
accretion processes are required to grow cores.

filament structure into two branches, and the upper branch erupts eventually.
Doppler shifts indicate clear bidirectional outflows of ~100 km/s, which
decelerate beyond the reconnection site. Differential-emission-measure analysis
reveals that in the reconnection region the temperature reaches over 10 MK and
the thermal energy is much larger than the kinetic energy. This Letter provides

vehicles. Early works mainly focused on designing complicated architectures for
deep-learning-based prediction models in normal-illumination environments,
which fail in dealing with low-light conditions. This paper proposes a novel
approach for trajectory prediction in low-illumination scenarios by leveraging
multi-stream information fusion, which flexibly integrates image, optical flow,
and object trajectory information. The image channel employs Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract
temporal information from the camera. The optical flow channel is applied to
capture the pattern of relative motion between adjacent camera frames and
modelled by Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN). The
trajectory channel is used to recognize high-level interactions between
vehicles. Finally, information from all the three channels is effectively fused
in the prediction module to generate future trajectories of surrounding
vehicles in low-illumination conditions. The proposed multi-channel graph
convolutional approach is validated on HEV-I and newly generated Dark-HEV-I,
egocentric vision datasets that primarily focus on urban intersection
scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines,
in standard and low-illumination scenarios. Additionally, our approach is

and predicts the flow behavior of particulate and fluid systems. GNS
discretizes the domain with nodes representing a collection of material points
and the links connecting the nodes representing the local interaction between
particles or clusters of particles. The GNS learns the interaction laws through
message passing on the graph. GNS has three components: (a) Encoder, which
embeds particle information to a latent graph, the edges are learned functions;
(b) Processor, which allows data propagation and computes the nodal
interactions across steps; and (c) Decoder, which extracts the relevant
dynamics (e.g., particle acceleration) from the graph. We introduce
physics-inspired simple inductive biases, such as an inertial frame that allows
learning algorithms to prioritize one solution (constant gravitational
acceleration) over another, reducing learning time. The GNS implementation uses
semi-implicit Euler integration to update the next state based on the predicted
accelerations. GNS trained on trajectory data is generalizable to predict
particle kinematics in complex boundary conditions not seen during training.
The trained model accurately predicts within a 5\% error of its associated
material point method (MPM) simulation. The predictions are 5,000x faster than
traditional MPM simulations (2.5 hours for MPM simulations versus 20 s for GNS
simulation of granular flow). GNS surrogates are popular for solving
optimization, control, critical-region prediction for in situ viz, and
inverse-type problems. The GNS code is available under the open-source MIT

simultaneous and continuous PN X-ray and OM UV (UVW1 2910\AA) lightcurves which
sample short-timescale variations better than previous observations. These
observations were simultaneous with 22d of Swift X-ray and UV/optical
monitoring, reported previously, and 4d of AstroSat X-ray (SXT), far (FUV
1541\AA), and near (NUV 2632\AA) UV allowing lag measurements between them and
the highly-sampled XMM. From the XMM we find that UVW1 lags behind the X-rays
by 29.5$\pm$1.3ks, $\sim$half the lag previously determined from the Swift
monitoring. Re-examination of the \textit{Swift} data reveals a bimodal lag
distribution, with evidence for both the long and short lags. However if we
detrend the Swift lightcurves by LOWESS filtering with a 5d width, only the
shorter lag (23.8$\pm$21.2ks) remains. The NUV observations, compared to PN and
SXT, confirm the $\sim$30ks lag found by XMM and, after 4d filtering is applied
to remove the long-timescale component, the FUV shows a lag of $\sim$23ks. The
resultant new UVW1, FUV, and NUV lag spectrum extends to the X-ray band without
requiring additional X-ray to UV lag offset, which if the UV arises from
reprocessing of X-rays, implies direct illumination of the reprocessor. By
referencing previous Swift and HST lag measurements, we obtain an X-ray to
optical lag spectrum which agrees with a model using the KYNreverb
disc-reprocessing code, assuming the accepted mass of
$7.63\times10^{6}M_{\odot}$ and a spin approaching maximum. Previously noted

(SDO) and the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board the Solar Orbiter.
We synthesize the Stokes profiles in a snapshot of a three dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar photosphere under both LTE and NLTE
conditions. The simulation cube contains a sunspot and a plage region around
it. The LTE and NLTE Stokes profiles formed in different features are compared
and analysed. NLTE effects are evident in both intensity and polarization
profiles. For the 6173 A line, UV overionization is the dominant NLTE
mechanism, and scattering effects are much less important. In addition to Fe,
an NLTE treatment of Si, Mg and Al is necessary to set the right photon density
in the UV. This is found to further enhance the LTE departures compared to the
case where Fe alone is treated in NLTE. These effects in the Stokes profiles
survive even when the profiles are averaged spatially or sampled on a coarse
wavelength grid such as that used by the SDO/HMI and other magnetographs. The
deviations from the LTE profiles are stronger in the Fe I 6173 A compared to
the 6301 A - 6302 A lines because in case of the latter, line scattering
compensates the effect of UV overionization. Based on the nature of departures
from LTE, treating the 6173 A line in LTE will likely result in an
over-estimation of temperature and an under-estimation of the magnetic field
strength.

These observables are usually referred to as oriented event shapes, and it has
been shown that the $\theta_T$ dependence can be split in two structures,
dubbed the unoriented and angular terms. Since the unoriented part is already
known, we compute the differential and cumulative distributions in fixed-order
for the angular part up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$. Our results show that, for
the vector current, there is a non-zero $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^0)$ contribution,
in contrast to the axial-vector current or for massless quarks. This entails
that for the vector current one should expect singular terms at
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ as well as infrared divergences in real- and
virtual-radiation diagrams that should cancel when added up. On the
phenomenological side, and taking into account that electroweak factors enhance
the vector current, it implies that finite bottom-mass effects are an important
correction since they are not damped by a power of the strong coupling and
therefore cannot be neglected in precision studies. Finally, we show that the

then fine-tune it using a support set comprising a few randomly selected and
annotated training target images. In this paper, we argue that the random
selection of unlabelled training target images to be annotated and included in
the support set may not enable an effective fine-tuning process, so we propose
a new approach to optimise this image selection process. Our approach involves
a new scoring function to find informative unlabelled target images. In
particular, we propose to measure the consistency in the model predictions on
target images against specific data augmentations. However, we observe that the
model trained with source datasets does not reliably evaluate consistency on
target images. To alleviate this problem, we propose novel self-supervised
pretext tasks to compute the scores of unlabelled target images. Finally, the
top few images with the least consistency scores are added to the support set
for oracle (i.e., expert) annotation and later used to fine-tune the model to
the target images. In our evaluations that involve the segmentation of five
different types of cell images, we demonstrate promising results on several
target test sets compared to the random selection approach as well as other
selection approaches, such as Shannon's entropy and Monte-Carlo dropout.

circuit design, improving the predictability and adaptability of each component
for predictive maintenance. This approach is envisioned to encourage the
development of new EDA tools such as automatic digital shadow generation and

that adequately define the operating conditions for dynamic prediction and
fault detection. Integration of a supplementary artificial intelligence block
within the control loop is considered for capturing non-linearities and
gain/bandwidth constraints of the main controller and identifying changes in
the operating conditions beyond the response of the controller. System
integration topics are discussed regarding integration within OPC Unified

between infinite-layer nickelates and cuprates. However, despite some formal
valence and crystal symmetry analogies, the electronic properties of
infinite-layer nickelates are remarkably original accounting, among other
properties, of a unique Nd5d-Ni3d hybridization. This designates infinite-layer
nickelates as a new class of oxide superconductors which should be considered
on their own. Here we report about Nd1-xSrxNiO2 (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.2) thin
films synthesized with and without a SrTiO3 capping-layer, showing very smooth
and step-terraced surface morphologies. Angle-dependent anisotropic
magnetoresistance measurements performed with a magnetic field rotating
in-plane or out-of-plane with respect to the sample surface, rendered important
information about the magnetic properties of undoped SrTiO3-capped and uncapped
samples. The results point at a key role of the capping-layer in controlling
the magnitude and the anisotropy of the anisotropic magnetoresistance
properties. We discuss this control in terms of a combined effect between the
Nd-Ni hybridization and an intra-atomic exchange coupling between the Nd-4f and
Nd-5d states, the latter essentially contributing to the (magneto)transport.
Further studies foresee the influence of the capping layer on infinite-layer
nickelates with no magnetic rare-earth.

work, we leverage the capabilities of LE-$\mu$SR to perform an investigation of
the SiO$_\text{2}$-SiC interface. Thermally oxidized samples are investigated
before and after annealing in nitric oxide (NO) and argon (Ar) ambience.
Thermal oxidation is found to result in structural changes both in the SiC
crystal close to the interface and at the interface itself. Annealing in NO
environment is known to passivate the defects leading to a reduction of the
density of interface traps (D$_{it}$); LE-$\mu$SR further reveals that the NO
annealing results in a thin layer of high carrier concentration in SiC,
extending to more than 50 nm depending on the annealing conditions. We also see
indications of Si vacancy (V$_{Si}$) formation in SiC after thermal oxidation.
Following NO annealing, nitrogen occupies the V$_{Si}$ sites, leading to the
reduction in D$_{it}$ and at the same time, creating a charge-carrier-rich
region near the interface. By comparing the LE-$\mu$SR data from a sample with
known doping density, we perform a high-resolution quantification of the free
carrier concentration near the interface after NO annealing and discuss the
origin of observed near-surface variations. Finally, the depletion of carriers
in a MOS capacitor in the region below the interface is shown using LE-$\mu$SR.
The NO annealed sample shows the narrowest depletion region, likely due to the
reduced D$_{it}$ and charge-carrier-rich region near the interface. Our
findings demonstrate the many benefits of utilizing LE-$\mu$SR to study
critical regions of semiconductor devices that have been inaccessible with
other techniques while retaining nanoscale depth resolution and a

we experimentally and analytically demonstrate that a 2D photonic borophene

by the band flatness, NLSs play a key role in studying the fundamental physics
of flat band systems. Our results truly transform the current understanding of

show that the increase of $M_\chi$ favors the model to attain data from LVC

of the crustal fraction of the moment of inertia ($I_{\rm{\tiny crust}}/I$).

However, most existing efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches for VLMs

Kafka and Flink, already provide basic extensions for the training of neural
networks in a stream-processing pipeline. However, these extensions are not

integrate the neural-network libraries as a first-class citizen into their
architectures. In this paper, we present TensAIR, which provides an end-to-end

asynchronous iterative routing. TensAIR supports the common dataflow operators,
such as Map, Reduce, Join, and has been augmented by the data-parallel OL
functions train and predict. These belong to the new Model operator, in which
an initial TensorFlow model (either freshly initialized or pre-trained) is
replicated among multiple decentralized worker nodes. Our decentralized
architecture allows TensAIR to efficiently shard incoming data batches across
the distributed model replicas, which in turn trigger the model updates via
asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. We empirically demonstrate that
TensAIR achieves a nearly linear scale-out in terms of (1) the number of worker
nodes deployed in the network, and (2) the throughput at which the data batches
arrive at the dataflow operators. We exemplify the versatility of TensAIR by
investigating both sparse (Word2Vec) and dense (CIFAR-10) use-cases, for which
we are able to demonstrate very significant performance improvements in
comparison to Kafka, Flink, and Horovod. We also demonstrate the magnitude of

result in domains that are micrometers or larger, and non-uniform in size,
limiting their surface area, mechanical strength, and interaction with

$3/2^+$ parity-doublet partner and the $3/2^-$ ground state is perfectly suited
to apply the sensitive technique of recoil-free selfabsorption, commonly known
as M\""ossbauer spectroscopy. In this experimental approach, the lifetime of the
$3/2^+$ upper parity-doublet partner allows an estimate of the lower limit of
$\Delta E = 2\cdot \Gamma_{\gamma}$= $23.7(1) \times 10^{-9}$ eV for the
achievable energy resolution to be made. This resolution must be exceeded by
the interaction of a CP-violating moment and the corresponding multipole moment
of the field distribution in the lattice. This work presents the first ideas
for patterns caused by CP-violating moments on the expected quadrupole
splitting and nuclear Zeeman effect.

transmitter extracts the interpretable latent representation from the original

a privacy filter and a knowledge base to erase private information and replace

  Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The widespread success of convolutional neural networks may largely be
attributed to their intrinsic property of translation equivariance. However,
convolutions are not equivariant to variations in scale and fail to generalize
to objects of different sizes. Despite recent advances in this field, it
remains unclear how well current methods generalize to unobserved scales on
real-world data and to what extent scale equivariance plays a role. To address
this, we propose the novel Scaled and Translated Image Recognition (STIR)
benchmark based on four different domains. Additionally, we introduce a new
family of models that applies many re-scaled kernels with shared weights in
parallel and then selects the most appropriate one. Our experimental results on
STIR show that both the existing and proposed approaches can improve
generalization across scales compared to standard convolutions. We also
demonstrate that our family of models is able to generalize well towards larger
scales and improve scale equivariance. Moreover, due to their unique design we
can validate that kernel selection is consistent with input scale. Even so,
none of the evaluated models maintain their performance for large differences
in scale, demonstrating that a general understanding of how scale equivariance
can improve generalization and robustness is still lacking.

a non-monotonic evolution with increasing pressure. The superconducting

robust and persists up to the high-pressure regime. Considering both robust

Galaxy triplets (systems composed of three physically bound galaxies)
constitute one of simplest group of galaxies and are therefore excellent
laboratories to study evolutionary mechanisms where effects of the environment
are minimal. We present a statistical study of the dynamical properties of
isolated galaxy triplets as a function of their local and large scale
environments. To explore the connection of the dynamical evolution on the
systems with the evolution of the galaxies composing the triplets, we consider
observational properties as morphology and star formation rate (SFR). We used
the SDSS-based catalog of Isolated Triplets (SIT), which contains 315 triplets.
We classified each triplet according to galaxy morphologies and defined a
parameter $Q_{trip}$ to quantify the total local tidal strengths in the
systems. To quantify the dynamical stage of the system we used the parameters
harmonic radius, $R_H$, velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{vr}$, crossing time,
$H_0t_c$, and virial mass, $M_{vir}$. Triplets composed of three early type
galaxies present smallest $R_H$, indicating that they are in general more
compact than triplets with one or more late type galaxies. Among triplets with
low values of $R_H$ and $H_0t_c$, SIT triplets with $Q_{trip}$<-2 are relaxed
systems, more dynamically evolved, while triplets with $Q_{trip}$>-2 show
compact configurations due to interactions within the system, such as on-going
mergers. We found that there is no dominant galaxy in triplets in terms of
properties of stellar populations such as global colour and SFR. Moreover, the
global SFR in isolated triplets composed of two or more early-type galaxies
increases with the stellar mass ratio of the galaxies with respect to the
central galaxy, therefore the system is globally 'rejuvenated'.

  The model with solar metallicity and C/O ratio provides a poor fit because
the H$^{-}$ signal is stronger than expected, requiring an excess of electrons.
This pushes our retrievals toward high atmospheric metallicities
($[M/H]=1.98^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$) and a C/O ratio that is subsolar by 2.4$\sigma$.
We question the viability of forming such a high-metallicity planet, and
therefore provide other scenarios to increase the electron density in this

results in an atmosphere with a slightly subsolar metallicity and subsolar C/O

results in predicting cancer response to drug treatments while utilizing deep
learning methods. These papers investigate diverse data representations, neural
network architectures, learning methodologies, and evaluations schemes.
However, deciphering promising predominant and emerging trends is difficult due
to the variety of explored methods and lack of standardized framework for
comparing drug response prediction models. To obtain a comprehensive landscape
of deep learning methods, we conducted an extensive search and analysis of deep
learning models that predict the response to single drug treatments. A total of
60 deep learning-based models have been curated and summary plots were
generated. Based on the analysis, observable patterns and prevalence of methods
have been revealed. This review allows to better understand the current state

(iCOMs) for decades, it is still a matter of debate whether they are
synthesized in the gas-phase or on the icy surface of interstellar grains. In
the past, molecular deuteration has been used to constrain the formation paths
of small and abundant hydrogenated interstellar species. More recently, the
deuteration degree of formamide, one of the most interesting iCOM, has also
been explained in the hypothesis that it is formed by the gas-phase reaction
NH$_2$ + H$_2$CO. In this article, we aim at using molecular deuteration to
constrain the formation of another iCOM, glycolaldehyde, which is an important
prebiotic species. More specifically, we have performed dedicated electronic
structure and kinetic calculations to establish the glycolaldehyde deuteration
degree in relation to that of ethanol, which is its possible parent species
according to the suggestion of Skouteris et al. (2018). We found that the
abundance ratio of the species containing one D-atom over the all-protium
counterpart depends on the produced D isotopomer and varies from 0.9 to 0.5.
These theoretical predictions compare extremely well with the monodeuterated
isotopomers of glycolaldehyde and that of ethanol measured towards the
Solar-like protostar IRAS 16293-2422, supporting the hypothesis that
glycolaldehyde could be produced in the gas-phase for this source. In addition,
the present work confirms that the deuterium fractionation of iCOMs cannot be
simply anticipated based on the deuterium fractionation of the parent species
but necessitates a specific study, as already shown for the case of formamide.

iteratively improves it by searching a large neighborhood around the current

correlation between variables to be optimized, leading to compromised
performance. This paper presents a general adaptive constraint partition-based
optimization framework (ACP) for large-scale IPs that can efficiently use any
existing optimization solver as a subroutine. Specifically, ACP first randomly
partitions the constraints into blocks, where the number of blocks is
adaptively adjusted to avoid local optima. Then, ACP uses a subroutine solver
to optimize the decision variables in a randomly selected block of constraints
to enhance the variable correlation. ACP is compared with LNS framework with
different subroutine solvers on four IPs and a real-world IP. The experimental
results demonstrate that in specified wall-clock time ACP shows better
performance than SCIP and Gurobi.

boxes and category labels for each object of interest in a given image. The
category is related to a linguistic symbol such as 'dog' or 'person' and there
should be relationships among them. However the object detector only learns to
classify the categories and does not treat them as the linguistic symbols.
Multi-modal models often use the pre-trained object detector to extract object
features from the image, but the models are separated from the detector and the
extracted visual features does not change with their linguistic input. We
rethink the object detection as a vision-and-language reasoning task. We then
propose targeted detection task, where detection targets are given by a natural
language and the goal of the task is to detect only all the target objects in a
given image. There are no detection if the target is not given. Commonly used
modern object detectors have many hand-designed components like anchor and it
is difficult to fuse the textual inputs into the complex pipeline. We thus
propose Language-Targeted Detector (LTD) for the targeted detection based on a
recently proposed Transformer-based detector. LTD is a encoder-decoder
architecture and our conditional decoder allows the model to reason about the
encoded image with the textual input as the linguistic context. We evaluate
detection performances of LTD on COCO object detection dataset and also show
that our model improves the detection results with the textual input grounding

towards the previous results obtained for the neutral perfect fluid star.
Therefore, the criterion for the dynamic stability of our charged star in
dynamic equilibrium within the symplectic complement of the trivial
perturbaions with the ADM $3$-momentum unchanged is given by the non-negativity
of the canonical energy associated with the timelike Killing field, where it is
further shown for both non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric perturbations that the
dynamic stability against these restricted perturbations also implies the
dynamic stability against more generic perturbations. On the other hand, the
necessary condition for the thermodynamic stability of our charged star in
thermodynamic equilibrium is given by the positivity of the canonical energy of
all the linear on-shell perturbations with the ADM angular momentum unchanged
in the comoving frame, which is equivalent to the positivity of the canonical
energy associated with the timelike Killing field when restricted onto the
axisymmetric perturbations. As a by-product, we further establish the
equivalence of the dynamic and thermodynamic stability with respect to the
spherically symmetric perturbations of the static, spherically symmetric

implicitly assumes asymmetry i.e., for a phone, we would like to recommend a

a phone. We also do not limit ourselves to complementary or substitute product
recommendation. For example, for a specific night wear t-shirt, we can suggest
similar t-shirts as well as track pants. So, the notion of relatedness is
subjective to the query product and dependent on customer preferences. Further,
various factors such as product price, availability lead to presence of

orthogonal to each other deeming our problem nontrivial. To address these, we

Particularly, random-LTD achieves considerable speedups and comparable accuracy
as the standard training baseline. Compared to other token dropping methods,
random-LTD does not require (1) any importance score-based metrics, (2) any
special token treatment (e.g., [CLS]), and (3) many layers in full sequence
length training except the first and the last layers. Besides, a new LayerToken
learning rate schedule is proposed for pretraining problems that resolve the

demonstrate that random-LTD can be applied to broader applications, including

and common-sense knowledge, resolving ambiguities can be notoriously hard for
machines. In this work, we study ambiguities that arise in text-to-image
generative models. We curate a benchmark dataset covering different types of
ambiguities that occur in these systems. We then propose a framework to
mitigate ambiguities in the prompts given to the systems by soliciting
clarifications from the user. Through automatic and human evaluations, we show
the effectiveness of our framework in generating more faithful images aligned
with human intention in the presence of ambiguities.

  Extracted from Network Automata",,,,,"cs.SI cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Network modeling has proven to be an efficient tool for many
interdisciplinary areas, including social, biological, transport, and many
other real world complex systems. In addition, cellular automata (CA) are a
formalism that has been studied in the last decades as a model for exploring
patterns in the dynamic spatio-temporal behavior of these systems based on
local rules. Some studies explore the use of cellular automata to analyze the
dynamic behavior of networks, denominating them as network automata (NA).
Recently, NA proved to be efficient for network classification, since it uses a
time-evolution pattern (TEP) for the feature extraction. However, the TEPs
explored by previous studies are composed of binary values, which does not
represent detailed information on the network analyzed. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose alternate sources of information to use as descriptor for the
classification task, which we denominate as density time-evolution pattern
(D-TEP) and state density time-evolution pattern (SD-TEP). We explore the
density of alive neighbors of each node, which is a continuous value, and
compute feature vectors based on histograms of the TEPs. Our results show a
significant improvement compared to previous studies at five synthetic network
databases and also seven real world databases. Our proposed method demonstrates
not only a good approach for pattern recognition in networks, but also shows
great potential for other kinds of data, such as images.

One measure of physical activity, the step count, is well known as a predictor
of long-term morbidity and mortality. Step Counting (SC) is the automated
counting of the number of steps an individual takes over a specified period of
time and space. Due to the ubiquity of smartphones and smartwatches, most
current SC approaches rely on the built-in accelerometer sensors on these
devices. The sensor signals are analyzed as multivariate time series, and the
number of steps is calculated through a variety of approaches, such as
time-domain, frequency-domain, machine-learning, and deep-learning approaches.
Most of the existing approaches rely on dividing the input signal into windows,
detecting steps in each window, and summing the detected steps. However, these
approaches require the determination of multiple parameters, including the
window size. Furthermore, most of the existing deep-learning SC approaches
require ground-truth labels for every single step, which can be arduous and
time-consuming to annotate. To circumvent these requirements, we present a
novel SC approach utilizing many-to-one attention-based LSTM. With the proposed
LSTM network, SC is solved as a regression problem, taking the entire sensor
signal as input and the step count as the output. The analysis shows that the
attention-based LSTM automatically learned the pattern of steps even in the
absence of ground-truth labels. The experimental results on three publicly
available SC datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully counts
the number of steps with low values of mean absolute error and high values of
SC accuracy.

The most noteworthy advantage of our method is that we can simply exploit the
initial-boundary data of a solution of a certain nonlinear equation to obtain
the data-driven solution of another evolution equation with the aid of PINNs
and during the process, the Miura transformation plays an indispensable role of
a bridge between solutions of two separate equations. It is tailored to the
inverse process of the Miura transformation and can overcome the difficulties
in solving solutions based on the implicit expression. Moreover, two schemes
are applied to perform abundant computational experiments to effectively
reproduce dynamic behaviors of solutions for the well-known KdV equation and
mKdV equation. Significantly, new data-driven solutions are successfully
simulated and one of the most important results is the discovery of a new
localized wave solution: kink-bell type solution of the defocusing mKdV
equation and it has not been previously observed and reported to our knowledge.
It provides a possibility for new types of numerical solutions by fully
leveraging the many-to-one relationship between solutions before and after
Miura transformations. Performance comparisons in different cases as well as
advantages and disadvantages analysis of two schemes are also discussed. On the
basis of the performance of two schemes and no free lunch theorem, they both
have their own merits and thus more appropriate one should be chosen according

location A and exchange conversations specific to location B, which we call the
Location A/B problem. The problem is considered solved if location entities can
be classified as either origin locations (Location As) or non-origin locations
(Location Bs). In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework--the
True Origin Model--to address the problem that uses machine-level natural
language understanding to identify tweets that conceivably contain their origin

state (67%), city (58%), county (56%) and district (64%) levels with support

employ a tweet contexualizer (locBERT) which is one of the core components of
the proposed model, to investigate multiple tweets' distributions for
understanding Twitter users' tweeting behavior in terms of mentioning origin

from the point of infinitely large energy density. We briefly discuss the
physical meaning of this prediction and its experimental confirmation
consisting of the discovery of redshift in the spectra of remote galaxies and
relic radiation. After mentioning the horizon problem in the theory of the hot
universe, the inflationary model is considered in connection with the concept
of quantum vacuum as an alternative to the inflaton field. The accelerated
expansion of the universe is discussed as powered by the cosmological constant

Significantly different from warehouse-scale computers that serve independent
concurrent user requests, this new class of computer systems directly interacts

safety-critical and mission-critical operations; their computations have
intertwined dependencies between not only adjacent execution loops but also
actions or decisions triggered by IoTs, edge, datacenters, or

  We have numerical evidence that the constrained disparity preserves the
original super-convergence: ${2p}$ order for planar curves and $\lfloor\frac

  Our optimization scheme consists of a globalized Newton method with a

inversion in the curve re-parameterization. Moreover, we introduce a
\emph{Julia} interface to the EGADS geometry kernel and a parallel optimization
algorithm. We test the potential of our curve mesh generation tool on a

challenge with CSSI is that conventional CDI reconstruction techniques cannot
be directly applied to CSSI because the Fourier-transform-based forward models
cannot reproduce the dynamical scattering phenomenon near the critical angle of
total external reflection of the substrate-supported samples. To overcome this

demonstrate that the system is time-reversal-symmetry-broken quantum spin Hall
insulator when $m_b<\lambda_{so}$, where $m_b$ is the exchange field operating
on the bottom Hg sublattice and $\lambda_{so}$ is the intrinsic SOC. For $m_b >

each valley is swapped (the Chern number becomes $C=-1$) by reversing the sign
of the exchange field. The system transitions to a valley-polarized metal and
quantum valley Hall phase as V increases. Along the phase boundaries, we
