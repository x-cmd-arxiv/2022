There are several ways to figure them out, but the main question is which acts
more reasonably than others. In this paper, we focus on the maximum entropy
principle as a suitable method of discovering the unknown distribution, which
recommends some prior information based on the available data set. We explain
its features by reviewing some papers. Furthermore, we recommend some articles
to study around the generalized maximum entropy issue, which is more suitable
when autocorrelation data exists. Then, we list the beneficial features of the
maximum entropy as a result. Finally, some disadvantages of entropy are
expressed to have a complete look at the maximum entropy principle, and we list
its drawbacks as the final step.

surface of a spherical TX is covered by heterogeneous receptors with different
sizes and arbitrary locations. If molecules hit any receptor, they are absorbed
by the TX immediately. Within the TX, molecules are stored in vesicles that are
continuously generated and released by the TX via the membrane fusion process.
Considering a transparent receiver (RX) and molecular degradation during the
propagation from the TX to the RX, we derive the molecule release rate and the
fraction of molecules absorbed by the TX as well as the received signal at the
RX. Notably, this analytical result is applicable for different numbers, sizes,
and locations of receptors, and its accuracy is verified via particle-based
simulations. Numerical results show that different vesicle generation rates
result in the same number of molecules absorbed by the TX, but different peak
received signals at the RX.

between non-rigid objects, by exploiting a reduced representation of
deformation fields. Different from existing works that represent deformation
fields by training a general-purpose neural network, we advocate for an
approximation based on mesh-free methods. By letting the network learn
deformation parameters at a sparse set of positions in space (nodes), we
reconstruct the continuous deformation field in a closed-form with guaranteed
smoothness. With this reduction in degrees of freedom, we show significant
improvement in terms of data-efficiency thus enabling limited supervision.
Furthermore, our approximation provides direct access to first-order
derivatives of deformation fields, which facilitates enforcing desirable
regularization effectively. Our resulting model has high expressive power and
is able to capture complex deformations. We illustrate its effectiveness
through state-of-the-art results across multiple deformable shape matching
benchmarks. Our code and data are publicly available at:

networks using posterior distributions for model parameters and network output.
By looking at these posterior distributions, one can separate the origin of
uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic. We use the joint distribution of
predictive uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty to quantify how this
interpretation of uncertainty depends upon model architecture, dataset
complexity, and data distributional shifts in image classification tasks. We
conclude that the origin of uncertainty is subjective to each neural network
and that the quantification of the induced uncertainty from data distributional
shifts depends on the complexity of the underlying dataset. Furthermore, we
show that the joint distribution of predictive and epistemic uncertainty can be
used to identify data domains where the model is most accurate. To arrive at
these results, we use two common posterior approximation methods, Monte-Carlo

then be learned well from a single decision tree. Therefore, MoDT can be
considered as a method that improves performance while maintaining
interpretability by making each of its decisions understandable and traceable
to humans.
  Our work is accompanied by a Python implementation, which uses an
interpretable gating function, a fast learning algorithm, and a direct

confirm that the implementation works and, more importantly, show the
superiority of our approach compared to single decision trees and random

perceive a remarkable distinction in arguments and techniques to achieve our

independently of sentence length and annotation style. Moreover, the
break-point is fairly stable across languages and averages values of 4-5 words,
suggesting that the amount of words that can be simultaneously processed
abstracts from the specific language to a high degree. Finally, we give an

the widths of dark windows are carefully analyzed, and the saturation point of
pumping light for nonlinear crystal conversion is obtained. We find that the
noise suppression effect is strongly sensitive to the pumping light power. The
degree of noise suppression can be up to 13.9 dB when the pumping light power
is 6.5 Beta_th. Moreover, a phase-sensitive modulation scheme is demonstrated,
which well fills the gap that multi-channel quantum noise suppression is
difficult to realize at the quadrature amplitude of squeezed field. Our result
is meaningful for various applications in precise measurement physics, quantum
information processing and quantum communications of system-on-a-chip.

star which is usually 8-10 orders of magnitude brighter than the planets. This
is achieved with the help of a stellar coronagraph. In the current work, a
concept of a new type of stellar coronagraph is introduced where the star light
is blocked by a linear polarizer in the collimated beam. It is based on
differential rotation between the linear polarization state of planet light and
that of star light. This is achieved with the help of a set of thick
birefringent crystals in the collimated beam of a telescope where the planet
light is made to travel extra optical path length compared to star light. By
adjusting the orientation and thickness of the crystal, the optical path length
can be made to cause a phase difference of {\pi}, just enough to rotate the
initial plane of polarization by 90{\deg} for planet-light without affecting
the star light. Theoretical calculations involving the phase difference due to
birefringent crystals are presented here along with the basic configuration and
design. It is shown that the design blocks the star light identically at all
wavelengths. Application of this concept for detecting Earth-like extrasolar
planet is discussed using a one-meter class telescope.

recently emerged. Despite its superiority to classical methods, it requires
many training iterations to converge and detect informative features. The
computational time becomes prohibitively long for datasets with a large number
of samples or a very high dimensional feature space. In this paper, we present
a new efficient unsupervised method for feature selection based on sparse
autoencoders. In particular, we propose a new sparse training algorithm that
optimizes a model's sparse topology during training to pay attention to
informative features quickly. The attention-based adaptation of the sparse
topology enables fast detection of informative features after a few training
iterations. We performed extensive experiments on 10 datasets of different
types, including image, speech, text, artificial, and biological. They cover a
wide range of characteristics, such as low and high-dimensional feature spaces,
and few and large training samples. Our proposed approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of selecting informative features while
reducing training iterations and computational costs substantially. Moreover,
the experiments show the robustness of our method in extremely noisy

behind the rapid urbanization in a city. Since there are high levels of social

discover all UVs for making appropriate renovation policies. Existing
approaches to detecting UVs are labor-intensive or have not fully addressed the
unique challenges in UV detection such as the scarcity of labeled UVs and the
diverse urban patterns in different regions. To this end, we first build an
urban region graph (URG) to model the urban area in a hierarchically structured

detect the urban village from the URG. The core idea of such a framework is to
firstly pre-train a basis (or master) model over the URG, and then to
adaptively derive specific (or slave) models from the basis model for different
regions. The proposed framework can learn to balance the generality and
specificity for UV detection in an urban area. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments in three cities to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

cause cosmic catastrophe if it comes to dominate the Universe. The network may
be made unstable by invoking a `tilt' in the axion potential due to Planck
scale suppressed non-renormalisable operators. Alternatively the random walk of
the axion field during inflation can generate a `bias' favouring one of the
degenerate vacua, but we find that this mechanism is in practice irrelevant.
Consideration of the axion abundance generated by the decay of the wall network

the DFSZ axion with mass below 11 meV, where most experimental searches are in

result, designing a deep learning model to count cells in a source domain

this issue, manual annotation costs are typically the norm when training deep
learning-based cell counting models across different domains. In this paper, we
propose a cross-domain cell counting approach that requires only weak human
annotation efforts. Initially, we implement a cell counting network that
disentangles domain-specific knowledge from domain-agnostic knowledge in cell
images, where they pertain to the creation of domain style images and cell
density maps, respectively. We then devise an image synthesis technique capable
of generating massive synthetic images founded on a few target-domain images
that have been labeled. Finally, we use a public dataset consisting of
synthetic cells as the source domain, where no manual annotation cost is
present, to train our cell counting network; subsequently, we transfer only the
domain-agnostic knowledge to a new target domain of real cell images. By
progressively refining the trained model using synthesized target-domain images
and several real annotated ones, our proposed cross-domain cell counting method
achieves good performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques that rely on
fully annotated training images in the target domain. We evaluated the efficacy
of our cross-domain approach on two target domain datasets of actual microscopy

to control the physical world in different phases, which differentiates from
attackers activities. For example, it is typical for SCADA to setup ICS device
objects during initialization, but anomalous during processcontrol. To extract
unique behaviors of SCADA execution phases, SCAPHY first leverages open ICS
conventions to generate a novel physical process dependency and impact graph
(PDIG) to identify disruptive physical states. SCAPHY then uses PDIG to inform
a physical process-aware dynamic analysis, whereby code paths of SCADA
process-control execution is induced to reveal API call behaviors unique to
legitimate process-control phases. Using this established behavior, SCAPHY
selectively monitors attackers physical world-targeted activities that violates
legitimate processcontrol behaviors. We evaluated SCAPHY at a U.S. national lab

maneuvers performed by sea birds and gliders in which differences in wind speed
are exploited to gain velocity, in the proposed technique a lift-generating
spacecraft circles between regions of the heliosphere that have different wind
speeds, gaining energy without the use of propellant and only modest onboard
power requirements. The spacecraft motion can be modeled as a series of elastic
collisions between regions of the medium moving at different speeds. Models of
the trajectory are developed to predict the potential velocity gains and the
maximum velocity that may be achieved in terms of the lift-to-drag ratio of the
vehicle. A lift-generating mechanism is proposed in which power is extracted
from the flow over the vehicle in the flight direction and then used to
accelerate the surrounding medium in the transverse direction, generating lift.
Large values of lift-to-drag ratio are shown to be possible in the case where a
small transverse velocity is imparted over a large area of interaction. The
requirement for large interaction area in the extremely low density of the

influences several functional properties, in particular optical properties.
However, a fast and reliable first-principles prediction of band gaps remains a
challenging problem. Standard DFT approximations tend to strongly underestimate
band gaps, while the more accurate $GW$ and hybrid functionals are much more
computationally demanding and unsuitable for high-throughput screening. In this
work, we have performed an extensive benchmark of several approximations with
different computational complexity ($G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol, HSE06, PBEsol, mBJ,
PBEsol$-1/2$, and ACBN0) to evaluate and compare their performance in
predicting the band gap of semiconductors. The benchmark is based on 114 binary
semiconductors of different compositions and crystal structures, where about
half of them have experimental band gaps. We find that, as expected,
$G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol performs well relative to the experiment, with a noticeable
underestimation of the band gaps by about 14% on average. Surprisingly,
$G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol is followed closely by the much computationally cheaper
pseudo-hybrid ACBN0 functional, showing an excellent performance with respect
to experimental data. The meta-GGA mBJ functional also performs well relative
to the experiment, even slightly better than $G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol in terms of
mean absolute (percentage) error. The HSE06 and PBEsol$-1/2$ schemes perform
overall worse than ACBN0 and mBJ schemes but much better than PBEsol. Comparing
the calculated band gaps on the whole data set (including the samples with no
experimental band gap), we find that HSE06 and mBJ have excellent agreement
with respect to the reference $G_{0}W_{0}$@PBEsol band gaps. Thus, we propose
the mBJ band gaps as economic descriptors when developing artificial
intelligence models for high-throughput screening of semiconductor band gaps.

very important to understand and interpret model predictions. However, this is
non-trivial for vision models since masking out parts of the input image and
replacing them with a baseline color like black or grey typically causes large
distribution shifts. Masking may even make the model focus on the masking
patterns for its prediction rather than the unmasked portions of the image. In
recent work, it has been shown that vision transformers are less affected by
such issues as one can simply drop the tokens corresponding to the masked image
portions. They are thus more easily interpretable using techniques like LIME
which rely on input perturbation. Using the same intuition, we devise a masking
technique for CNNs called layer masking, which simulates running the CNN on
only the unmasked input. We find that our method is (i) much less disruptive to
the model's output and its intermediate activations, and (ii) much better than

  The first application is based on a systematic investigation of transverse
collimator offsets relative to the laser and electron beam axis. We show that
the maximum energy of the LCS $\gamma$-ray beam is altered by vertical
collimator offsets, where the edge shifts towards lower energies with the
increase in the offset.
  Secondly, using the eliLaBr code, we investigate the effect of the laser
polarization plane orientation on the properties of the LCS $\gamma$-ray beams
produced with asymmetric emittance electron beams. We show that:
  1. The use of vertically polarized lasers contributes to the preservation of
the LCS $\gamma$-ray beam maximum energy edge by increasing the precision in
the vertical collimator alignment.
  2. Under identical conditions for the electron and laser beams phase-space
distributions, the energy spectrum of the scattered LCS $\gamma$-ray beam
changes with the laser beam polarization plane orientation: the use of
vertically polarized laser beams slightly deteriorates the LCS $\gamma$-ray

bite acquisition works consider single-arm spoon scooping or fork skewering,

For example, when acquiring a group of peas, skewering could smoosh the peas
while scooping without a barrier could result in chasing the peas on the plate.
In order to acquire foods with such diverse properties, we propose stabilizing
food items during scooping using a second arm, for example, by pushing peas
against the spoon with a flat surface to prevent dispersion. The added
stabilizing arm can lead to new challenges. Critically, this arm should
stabilize the food scene without interfering with the acquisition motion, which
is especially difficult for easily breakable high-risk food items like tofu.
These high-risk foods can break between the pusher and spoon during scooping,
which can lead to food waste falling out of the spoon. We propose a general
bimanual scooping primitive and an adaptive stabilization strategy that enables
successful acquisition of a diverse set of food geometries and physical
properties. Our approach, CARBS: Coordinated Acquisition with Reactive Bimanual
Scooping, learns to stabilize without impeding task progress by identifying
high-risk foods and robustly scooping them using closed-loop visual feedback.
We find that CARBS is able to generalize across food shape, size, and
deformability and is additionally able to manipulate multiple food items
simultaneously. CARBS achieves 87.0% success on scooping rigid foods, which is
25.8% more successful than a single-arm baseline, and reduces food breakage by

pendulum swing-up and stabilization, in simulation and on physical hardware.
Our experiments show that DT struggles with continuous control problems, such

a net force, resulting flows in an unbounded two-dimensional incompressible
low-Reynolds-number fluid or displacements in a two-dimensional linearly

center, which has led to some debate. Recently, we have demonstrated that such
divergences cancel when the total (net) force vanishes. Here, we illustrate
that, if a net force is present, the boundaries play a prominent role. Already
a single no-slip boundary regulates the flow and displacement fields and leads
to their decay to leading order inversely in distance from a force center and
the boundary. In other words, it is the boundary that stabilizes the system in
this situation, unlike the three-dimensional case, where an unbounded medium by
itself is able to absorb a net force. We quantify the mobility and

than one protein. In this work, we explore the atomic force microscope (AFM)
assisted deep learning-based methods to predict the 3D structure of PCs. The
images produced by AFM capture the protein structure in different and random
orientations. These multi-view images can help train the neural network to
predict the 3D structure of protein complexes. However, obtaining the dataset
of actual AFM images is time-consuming and not a pragmatic task. We propose a
virtual AFM imaging pipeline that takes a 'PDB' protein file and generates
multi-view 2D virtual AFM images using volume rendering techniques. With this,
we created a dataset of around 8K proteins. We train a neural network for 3D
reconstruction called Pix2Vox++ using the synthesized multi-view 2D AFM images
dataset. We compare the predicted structure obtained using a different number
of views and get the intersection over union (IoU) value of 0.92 on the
training dataset and 0.52 on the validation dataset. We believe this approach
will lead to better prediction of the structure of protein complexes.

morphology and motions. Recent advances in creating bio-inspired morphing
robots and machines have led to the study of variable geometry truss (VGT),
structures that can approximate arbitrary geometries and has large degree of
freedom to deform. However, they are limited to simple geometries and motions
due to the excessively complex control system. While a recent work PneuMesh
solves this challenge with a novel VGT design that introduces a selective
channel connection strategy, it imposes new challenge in identifying effective
channel groupings and control methods.
  Building on top of the hardware concept presented in PneuMesh, we frame the
challenge into a co-design problem and introduce a learning-based model to find
a sub-optimal design. Specifically, given an initial truss structure provided
by a human designer, we first adopt a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the
channel grouping, and then couple GA with reinforcement learning (RL) for the
control. The model is tailored to the PneuMesh system with customized
initialization, mutation and selection functions, as well as the customized
translation-invariant state vector for reinforcement learning. The result shows
that our method enables a robotic table-based VGT to achieve various motions
with a limited number of control inputs. The table is trained to move, lower
its body or tilt its tabletop to accommodate multiple use cases such as
benefiting kids and painters to use it in different shape states, allowing
inclusive and adaptive design through morphing trusses.

where the goal is to classify unlabeled data with only one or ""a few"" labeled
exemplary samples. Neural networks are typically trained to minimize a distance
metric between labeled exemplary samples and a query set. Early few-shot
approaches use an episodic training process to sub-sample the training data
into few-shot batches. This training process matches the sub-sampling done on
evaluation. Recently, conventional supervised training coupled with a cosine
distance has achieved superior performance for few-shot. Despite the diversity
of few-shot approaches over the past decade, most methods still rely on the
cosine or Euclidean distance layer between the latent features of the trained
network. In this work, we investigate the distributions of trained few-shot
features and demonstrate that they can be roughly approximated as exponential
distributions. Under this assumption of an exponential distribution, we propose
a new maximum log-likelihood metric for few-shot architectures. We demonstrate

Three different secure centralized multi-transmitter coded caching scenarios

caching with reduced feedback, are considered and closed-form coding delay and
secret shared key storage expressions are provided. As our security guarantee,
we show that the delivery phase does not reveal any information to the

secure decentralized multi-transmitter coded caching scenario, in which there
is no cooperation between the clients and transmitters during the cache content
placement phase and study its performance compared to the centralized scheme.
We analyze the system's performance in terms of Coding Delay and guarantee the
security of our presented schemes using the Mutual Information metric.
Numerical evaluations verify that security incurs a negligible cost in terms of
memory usage when the number of files and users are scaled up, in both
centralized and decentralized scenarios. Also, we numerically show that by
increasing the number of files and users, the secure coding delay of
centralized and decentralized schemes became asymptotically equal.

occasionally sampling the trait of a neighbor, while an invasion bias
$\delta\geq 0$ expresses the stochastic preference to adopt the novel trait $A$
over the resident trait $B$. The strength of an invasion is measured by the
probability that eventually the whole population adopts trait $A$, i.e., the
fixation probability. In more realistic settings, however, the invasion bias is
not ubiquitous, but rather manifested only in parts of the network. For
instance, when modeling the spread of a social trait, the invasion bias
represents localized incentives. In this paper, we generalize the standard

examine the impacts of the magnetic permeability of a steel-cased well on
electromagnetic responses in grounded source experiments. We consider a
vertical wellbore and simulate time and frequency domain data on 3D cylindrical

domain and contributes to a phase shift in the frequency domain. We develop our
understanding of how permeability alters currents within, and external to, the
casing by focussing first on the time domain response and translating insights
to the frequency domain. Following others, we rewrite Maxwell's equations to
separate the response into terms that describe the magnetization and induction
effects. Magnetic permeability impacts the responses in two ways: (1) it
enhances the inductive component of the response in the casing, and (2) it
creates a magnetization current on the outer wall of the casing. The
interaction of these two effects results in a poloidal current system within
the casing. It also generates anomalous currents external to the casing that
can alter the geometry and magnitude of currents in the surrounding geologic
formation. This has the potential to be advantageous for enhancing responses in
monitoring applications.

digital reality. This need for integrating DTs into the metaverse while
operating them at the network edge has increased the demand for a decentralized
edge-enabled metaverse. Hence, to consolidate the fusion between real and
digital entities, it is necessary to harmonize the interoperability between DTs
and the metaverse at the edge. In this paper, a novel decentralized metaverse
framework that incorporates DT operations at the wireless edge is presented. In
particular, a system of autonomous physical twins (PTs) operating in a
massively-sensed zone is replicated as cyber twins (CTs) at the mobile edge
computing (MEC) servers. To render the CTs' digital environment, this zone is
partitioned and teleported as distributed sub-metaverses to the MEC servers. To
guarantee seamless synchronization of the sub-metaverses and their associated
CTs with the dynamics of the real world and PTs, respectively, this joint
synchronization problem is posed as an optimization problem whose goal is to
minimize the average sub-synchronization time between the real and digital
worlds, while meeting the DT synchronization intensity requirements. To solve
this problem, a novel iterative algorithm for joint sub-metaverse and DT
association at the MEC servers is proposed. This algorithm exploits the
rigorous framework of optimal transport theory so as to efficiently distribute
the sub-metaverses and DTs, while considering the computing and communication
resource allocations. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can
orchestrate the interplay between DTs and sub-metaverses to achieve a 25.75 %
reduction in the sub-synchronization time in comparison to the signal-to-noise
ratio-based association scheme.

can be approximated using sparse directed acyclic graphs to achieve scalable

typically assumed conditionally dependent on a small set of parents which

exhibit excellent empirical performance, but the lack of theoretical validation

radial neighbors Gaussian processes and corresponding theoretical guarantees.
We propose to approximate GPs using a sparse directed acyclic graph in which a
directed edge connects every location to all of its neighbors within a
predetermined radius. Using our novel construction, we show that one can
accurately approximate a Gaussian process in Wasserstein-2 distance, with an
error rate determined by the approximation radius, the spatial covariance
function, and the spatial dispersion of samples. Our method is also insensitive
to specific graphical model choice. We offer further empirical validation of
our approach via applications on simulated and real world data showing
state-of-the-art performance in posterior inference of spatial random effects.

strategies like output-regularization, data-augmentation, use of pre-trained

applicability of these strategies is 1) often constrained to particular
settings, e.g., availability of a pretrained GAN; or 2) increases training
time, e.g., when using pruning. In contrast, we propose a Discriminator

between the norm of the gradient of a discriminator's prediction w.r.t.\ real

and an outcome variable given a vector of covariates usually assume exact
knowledge of the conditional distribution of the predictor given the

conditional distribution learned in sample. We investigate the consequences of
this choice through the lens of the distilled conditional randomization test
(dCRT). We find that Type-I error control is still possible, but only if the
mean of the outcome variable given the covariates is estimated well enough.
This demonstrates that the dCRT is doubly robust, and motivates a comparison to
the generalized covariance measure (GCM) test, another doubly robust
conditional independence test. We prove that these two tests are asymptotically
equivalent, and show that the GCM test is optimal against (generalized)
partially linear alternatives by leveraging semiparametric efficiency theory.
In an extensive simulation study, we compare the dCRT to the GCM test. These
two tests have broadly similar Type-I error and power, though dCRT can have
somewhat better Type-I error control but somewhat worse power in small samples
or when the response is discrete. We also find that post-lasso based test
statistics (as compared to lasso based statistics) can dramatically improve
Type-I error control for both methods.

distribution in the attention and output of the model across domains, i.e.,
attention-level and output-level alignment. We also enforce consistency in
attention maps between different augmented views to further strengthen the
attention-based alignment. Combining these two components, our method mitigates
the discrepancy in attention maps across domains and further boosts the
performance of the transformer under unsupervised domain adaptation settings.
Our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baseline model on three
widely used benchmarks, including GTAV-to-Cityscapes by 1.3 percent point (pp),
Synthia-to-Cityscapes by 0.6 pp, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC by 1.1 pp, on average.
Additionally, we verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our method
through extensive experiments. Our code will be publicly available.

Transformer has demonstrated the tremendous potential of Transformer for vision
tasks. It surmounts the key challenge of high computational complexity by
performing local self-attention within shifted windows. In this work we propose
the Semantic-Aware Local-Global Vision Transformer (SALG), to further
investigate two potential improvements towards Swin Transformer. First, unlike
Swin Transformer that performs uniform partition to produce equal size of
regular windows for local self-attention, our SALG performs semantic
segmentation in an unsupervised way to explore the underlying semantic priors
in the image. As a result, each segmented region can correspond to a
semantically meaningful part in the image, potentially leading to more
effective features within each of segmented regions. Second, instead of only
performing local self-attention within local windows as Swin Transformer does,
the proposed SALG performs both 1) local intra-region self-attention for
learning fine-grained features within each region and 2) global inter-region
feature propagation for modeling global dependencies among all regions.
Consequently, our model is able to obtain the global view when learning
features for each token, which is the essential advantage of Transformer. Owing
to the explicit modeling of the semantic priors and the proposed local-global
modeling mechanism, our SALG is particularly advantageous for small-scale
models when the modeling capacity is not sufficient for other models to learn
semantics implicitly. Extensive experiments across various vision tasks
demonstrates the merit of our model over other vision Transformers, especially
in the small-scale modeling scenarios.

three phases by synergizing contrastive learning and generative learning
methods: 1) Sample Space Diversification: Reconstructive proxy tasks have been
enabled to embed a priori knowledge with context highlighted to diversify the
expanded sample space; 2) Enhanced Representation Learning: Informative
noise-contrastive estimation loss regularizes the encoder to enhance
representation learning of annotation-free images; 3) Correlated Optimization:
Optimization operations in pre-training the encoder and the decoder have been
correlated via image restoration from proxy tasks, targeting the need for
semantic segmentation. Experiments have been conducted on public datasets of
biomedical microscopy images against the state-of-the-art counterparts (e.g.,
SimCLR and BYOL), and results demonstrate that: TOWER statistically excels in
all self-supervised methods, achieving a Dice improvement of 1.38 percentage

point of view. If a particle is prepared by a single slit of spatial width
$\Delta x$, it has been shown that a finite standard deviation
$\sigma_p<\infty$ can only be ensured if the wave-function is zero at the edge
of $\Delta x$, otherwise it does not exist [8]. Under this circumstances the
corresponding sharp inequality is $\sigma_p \Delta x\geq \pi\hbar$. This bound
will be reconsidered from the mathematical point of view in terms of a
variational problem in Hilbert space and will furthermore be tested in a
4f-single slit diffraction experiment of a laser beam. Our results will be
compared with a laser-experiment recently given by Fern\'andez-Guasti (2022)

has been applied in recommender systems (RS) to reduce inference latency.
Traditional solutions first train a full teacher model from the training data,
and then transfer its knowledge (\ie \textit{soft labels}) to supervise the
learning of a compact student model. However, we find such a standard
distillation paradigm would incur serious bias issue -- popular items are more
heavily recommended after the distillation. This effect prevents the student
model from making accurate and fair recommendations, decreasing the
effectiveness of RS.
  In this work, we identify the origin of the bias in KD -- it roots in the
biased soft labels from the teacher, and is further propagated and intensified
during the distillation. To rectify this, we propose a new KD method with a
stratified distillation strategy. It first partitions items into multiple
groups according to their popularity, and then extracts the ranking knowledge
within each group to supervise the learning of the student. Our method is
simple and teacher-agnostic -- it works on distillation stage without affecting
the training of the teacher model. We conduct extensive theoretical and

endoscopy is a fundamental task for surgical navigation in robotic surgery.
However, traditional stereo matching adopts binocular images to perceive the
depth information, which is difficult to transfer to the soft robotics-based
surgical systems due to the use of monocular endoscopy. In this paper, we
present a novel framework that combines robot kinematics and monocular
endoscope images with deep unsupervised learning into a single network for
metric depth estimation and then achieve 3D reconstruction of complex anatomy.
Specifically, we first obtain the relative depth maps of surgical scenes by
leveraging a brightness-aware monocular depth estimation method. Then, the
corresponding endoscope poses are computed based on non-linear optimization of
geometric and photometric reprojection residuals. Afterwards, we develop a
Depth-driven Sliding Optimization (DDSO) algorithm to extract the scaling
coefficient from kinematics and calculated poses offline. By coupling the
metric scale and relative depth data, we form a robust ensemble that represents
the metric and consistent depth. Next, we treat the ensemble as supervisory
labels to train a metric depth estimation network for surgeries (i.e.,
MetricDepthS-Net) that distills the embeddings from the robot kinematics,
endoscopic videos, and poses. With accurate metric depth estimation, we utilize
a dense visual reconstruction method to recover the 3D structure of the whole
surgical site. We have extensively evaluated the proposed framework on public
SCARED and achieved comparable performance with stereo-based depth estimation
methods. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach to
recover the metric depth and 3D structure with monocular inputs.

of over more than half the north sky. There was a physical disturbance within
the stream, 500 million years ago, which could have been the scar of a dark
matter collision. Due to its proximity to the galactic center, the GD-1 stellar
stream can act as an antenna for gravitational perturbations. In 2018, a
significant gap in GD-1 was discovered due to perturbation. A stream gap occurs
when a massive object collides with the stellar stream. Based on the chasm
location and width, we can guess when and where the impact occurred. Using
globular cluster sky coordinates and simulated galactocentric distributions, we
calculated how close each globular cluster came to the GD-1 stream. This would
be the first time a globular cluster has come close enough to the GD-1 stream
to impact another object. Clusters, on the other hand, rarely approach GD-1,
indicating that it was struck by something more exotic, like a clump of dark
matter, when discovered. A simulation and theoretical model were created to
better understand the GD-1 stellar stream behavior. These details can be used
to map the large-scale distribution of dark matter in our galaxy as well as the
small-scale structure of dark matter in the host galaxies of the streams.
Examination of stellar streams and detection of subhalos will not only confirm
the presence of dark matter but also reveal information about its particle

occluders. In this paper, we propose a feature pruning and consolidation (FPC)
framework to circumvent explicit human structure parse, which mainly consists
of a sparse encoder, a global and local feature ranking module, and a feature
consolidation decoder. Specifically, the sparse encoder drops less important
image tokens (mostly related to background noise and occluders) solely
according to correlation within the class token attention instead of relying on
prior human shape information. Subsequently, the ranking stage relies on the
preserved tokens produced by the sparse encoder to identify k-nearest neighbors
from a pre-trained gallery memory by measuring the image and patch-level
combined similarity. Finally, we use the feature consolidation module to
compensate pruned features using identified neighbors for recovering essential
information while disregarding disturbance from noise and occlusion.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on

outperforms state-of-the-art results by at least 8.6% mAP and 6.0% Rank-1

observes an isotropic background of thermal radiation reveals that de Sitter
space is equivalent to a thermal bath at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature in
Minkowski space, as far as the response rate of the detector is concerned.
Meanwhile, for a static detector which is endowed with a proper acceleration
with respect to the local freely-falling detectors, the temperature becomes the
square root of the sum of the squared Gibbons-Hawking temperature and the
squared Unruh temperature associated with the proper acceleration of the
detector. Here, we demonstrate, by examining the interaction of two static
detectors in the de Sitter invariant vacuum, that de Sitter space in regard to
its thermal nature is unique on its own right in the sense that it is even
neither equivalent to the thermal bath in Minkowski space when the static
detectors become freely-falling nor to the Unruh thermal bath at the
cosmological horizon where the Unruh effect dominates, insofar as the behavior
of the inter-detector interaction in de Sitter space dramatically differs both
from that in the Minkowski thermal bath and the Unruh thermal bath.

advance toward this goal, the AI community attempts to imitate qualities/skills
possessed by humans and imbibes them into machines with the help of
datasets/tasks. Earlier, many tasks which require knowledge about the objects
present in an image are satisfactorily solved by vision models. Recently, with
the aim to incorporate knowledge about non-object image regions (hideouts,
turns, and other obscured regions), a task for identification of potential
hideouts termed Covert Geo-Location (CGL) detection was proposed by Saha et al.
It involves identification of image regions which have the potential to either
cause an imminent threat or appear as target zones to be accessed for further
investigation to identify any occluded objects. Only certain occluding items
belonging to certain semantic classes can give rise to CGLs. This fact was
overlooked by Saha et al. and no attempts were made to utilize semantic class
information, which is crucial for CGL detection. In this paper, we propose a
multitask-learning-based approach to achieve 2 goals - i) extraction of
features having semantic class information; ii) robust training of the common
encoder, exploiting large standard annotated datasets as training set for the
auxiliary task (semantic segmentation). To explicitly incorporate class
information in the features extracted by the encoder, we have further employed
attention mechanism in a novel manner. We have also proposed a better
evaluation metric for CGL detection that gives more weightage to recognition
rather than precise localization. Experimental evaluations performed on the CGL

a speciation scheme is developed to protect evolution from early convergence by
restricting selection competition within species. To evaluate SANE, we carry

environmental challenges. Specifically, the genome of the selected cell
population from a blood sample is amplified by the well-known PCR process of
successive heating and cooling, producing a large number of reads. They number
roughly 30,000 to 300,000. Each read corresponds to a particular rearrangement
of so-called V(D)J sequences. In the end, the observation consists of a set of
numbers of reads corresponding to different V(D)J sequences. The underlying
relative frequencies of distinct V(D)J sequences can be summarized by a
probability vector, with the cardinality being the number of distinct V(D)J
rearrangements present in the blood. Statistical question is to make inferences
on a summary parameter of the probability vector based on a single
multinomial-type observation of a large dimension. Popular summary of the
diversity of a cell population includes clonality and entropy, or more
generally, is a suitable function of the probability vector. A point estimator
of the clonality based on multiple replicates from the same blood sample has
been proposed previously. After obtaining a point estimator of a particular
function, the remaining challenge is to construct a confidence interval of the
parameter to appropriately reflect its uncertainty. In this paper, we have
proposed to couple the empirical Bayes method with a resampling-based
calibration procedure to construct a robust confidence interval for different
population diversity parameters. The method has been illustrated via extensive

for nickel and silicon indicate that the produced topographies comprise both

consideration of the role of the non-thermal excited electron population (for

on old classes, resulting in poor generalization. To solve the problems, the
study proposes an Augmented Graph Convolutional Network (AGCN++) that can
construct the cross-task label relationships in MLCL and sustain catastrophic
forgetting. First, we build an Augmented Correlation Matrix (ACM) across all
seen classes, where the intra-task relationships derive from the hard label
statistics. In contrast, the inter-task relationships leverage hard and soft
labels from data and a constructed expert network. Then, we propose a novel

soft labels to create a more convincing ACM and suppress forgetting. Last, to
suppress the forgetting of label dependencies across old tasks, we propose a
relationship-preserving constrainter to construct label relationships. The
inter-class topology can be augmented automatically, which also yields
effective class representations. The proposed method is evaluated using two

the generalization ability of methods for FSS, which requires to effectively
exploit the dependency of the query image and the support examples. Most
existing methods abstracted support features into prototype vectors and
implemented the interaction with query features using cosine similarity or
feature concatenation. However, this simple interaction may not capture spatial
details in query features. To alleviate this limitation, a few methods utilized
all pixel-wise support information via computing the pixel-wise correlations
between paired query and support features implemented with the attention
mechanism of Transformer. These approaches suffer from heavy computation on the
dot-product attention between all pixels of support and query features. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework built upon Transformer
termed as ProtoFormer to fully capture spatial details in query features. It
views the abstracted prototype of the target class in support features as Query
and the query features as Key and Value embeddings, which are input to the
Transformer decoder. In this way, the spatial details can be better captured
and the semantic features of target class in the query image can be focused.
The output of the Transformer-based module can be viewed as semantic-aware
dynamic kernels to filter out the segmentation mask from the enriched query
features. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-$5^{i}$ and COCO-$20^{i}$ show that
our ProtoFormer significantly advances the state-of-the-art methods.

wavelength/velocity. Reverberations of spectroastrometric signals naturally
arise in broad-line regions (BLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as a result
of the continuum variations that drive responses of the broad emission lines
with time delays. Such signals provide a new diagnostic for mapping BLR
kinematics and geometry, complementary to the traditional intensity
reverberation mapping (RM) technique. We present the generic mathematical
formalism for spectroastrometric RM and show that under realistic parameters of
a phenomenological BLR model, the spectroastrometric reverberation signals vary
on a level of several to tens of microarcseconds, depending on the BLR size,
continuum variability, and angular-size distance. We also derive the analytical
expressions of spectroastrometric RM for an inclined ring-like BLR. We develop
a Bayesian framework with a sophisticated Monte Carlo sampling technique to
analyze spectroastrometric data and infer the BLR properties, including the
central black hole mass and angular-size distance. We demonstrate the potential
of spectroastrometric RM in spatially resolving BLR kinematics and geometry
through a suite of simulation tests. The application to realistic observation
data of 3C~273 obtains tentative, but enlightening results, reinforcing the
practical feasibility of conducting spectroastrometric RM experiments on bright

the Successive Rejects framework, which recommends an optimal arm and flags the

that it is designed on the basis of an information theoretic lower bound for
two-armed instances. We characterize an instance-dependent upper bound on the

visual environments by keeping data locally at each client (the individual
environment) during training. However, since the local data is inaccessible to
the server under federated learning, attackers may easily poison the training
data of the local client to build a backdoor in the agent without notice.
Deploying such an agent raises the risk of potential harm to humans, as the
attackers may easily navigate and control the agent as they wish via the
backdoor. Towards Byzantine-robust federated embodied agent learning, in this
paper, we study the attack and defense for the task of vision-and-language
navigation (VLN), where the agent is required to follow natural language
instructions to navigate indoor environments. First, we introduce a simple but
effective attack strategy, Navigation as Wish (NAW), in which the malicious
client manipulates local trajectory data to implant a backdoor into the global
model. Results on two VLN datasets (R2R and RxR) show that NAW can easily
navigate the deployed VLN agent regardless of the language instruction, without
affecting its performance on normal test sets. Then, we propose a new
Prompt-Based Aggregation (PBA) to defend against the NAW attack in federated
VLN, which provides the server with a ''prompt'' of the vision-and-language
alignment variance between the benign and malicious clients so that they can be
distinguished during training. We validate the effectiveness of the PBA method
on protecting the global model from the NAW attack, which outperforms other
state-of-the-art defense methods by a large margin in the defense metrics on

and thus addressing the imbalance in graphs has become of paramount importance.
In the context of node classification, one class has less examples than others.
Changing data composition is a popular way to address the imbalance in node
classification. This is done by resampling the data to balance the dataset.
However, that can sometimes lead to loss of information or add noise to the

dilemma is to design an efficient information sharing scheme among users to
replace the heavy and repetitive computation. In this paper, we propose a
free-space information sharing mechanism based on full-duplex device-to-device

results and the semantic features extracted from the user's own view image to
nearby users (i.e., other devices). On this basis, other users can use the
received semantic features to obtain the spatial matching of the computational
results under their own view images without repeating the computation. Using
generalized small-scale fading models, we analyze the key performance

the logit distillation in both instance-level and class-level. CLKD enables the
student model mimic higher semantic information from the teacher model, hence
improving the distillation performance. We further introduce a novel loss

the following three aspects: 1) document-level alignment by leveraging the
cross-modal and intra-modal contrastive loss; 2) global-local alignment for
modeling localized and structural information in document images; and 3)
local-level alignment for more accurate patch-level information. Experiments on

freestanding TMN membranes. Taken CrN as an example, the relatively small
lattice mismatch and identical cubic structure between BaO and CrN ensure the
growth of heterostructures. Millimeter-size CrN membrane allows us to directly
observe the planar-view of atomic structure and to correlate its electronic
state with intrinsic transport properties. Our work provides the opportunity to
fabricate freestanding TMN membranes and the ability to transfer them to
arbitrary substrates. The integration of TMN membranes with other materials
will stimulate further studies in the emergent phenomena at heterointerfaces.

uncontrolled behavior of selfish users. This may result in societal costs that
are significantly higher compared to what could be achieved by a centralized
system-optimal controller. Monetary tolling schemes can effectively align the
behavior of selfish users with the system-optimum. Yet, they inevitably
discriminate the population in terms of income. Artificial currencies were
recently presented as an effective alternative that can achieve the same
performance, whilst guaranteeing fairness among the population. However, those

adapt artificial-currency tolls within repetitive-game settings. We first
consider a parallel-arc setting whereby users commute on a daily basis from an
individual origin to an individual destination, choosing a route in exchange of
an artificial-currency price or reward, while accounting for the impact of the
choices of the other users on travel discomfort. Second, we devise a
model-based reinforcement learning controller that autonomously learns the
optimal pricing policy by interacting with the proposed framework considering
the closeness of the observed aggregate flows to a desired system-optimal
distribution as a reward function. Our numerical results show that the proposed
data-driven pricing scheme can effectively align the users' flows with the
system optimum, significantly reducing the societal costs with respect to the
uncontrolled flows (by about 15% and 25% depending on the scenario), and
respond to environmental changes in a robust and efficient manner.

a mask-based stochastic reconstruction module to make the gradients

progressive-resolution technique to guarantee fidelity, which produces
photorealistic images. Furthermore, we introduce a distance metric loss and a
non-trivial distribution loss to ensure classification neural networks can

challenging yet essential task as domain shifts are quite common among clinical
image datasets. Previous attempts most conduct global-only/random augmentation.
Their augmented samples are usually insufficient in diversity and
informativeness, thus failing to cover the possible target domain distribution.
In this paper, we rethink the data augmentation strategy for SDG in medical
image segmentation. Motivated by the class-level representation invariance and
style mutability of medical images, we hypothesize that unseen target data can
be sampled from a linear combination of $C$ (the class number) random
variables, where each variable follows a location-scale distribution at the
class level. Accordingly, data augmented can be readily made by sampling the
random variables through a general form. On the empirical front, we implement
such strategy with constrained B$\acute{\rm e}$zier transformation on both
global and local (i.e. class-level) regions, which can largely increase the
augmentation diversity. A Saliency-balancing Fusion mechanism is further
proposed to enrich the informativeness by engaging the gradient information,
guiding augmentation with proper orientation and magnitude. As an important
contribution, we prove theoretically that our proposed augmentation can lead to
an upper bound of the generalization risk on the unseen target domain, thus
confirming our hypothesis. Combining the two strategies, our Saliency-balancing
Location-scale Augmentation (SLAug) exceeds the state-of-the-art works by a
large margin in two challenging SDG tasks. Code is available at

electricity prices in the wholesale market, as the flexibility of the demand
can be harnessed to lower the demand level for price reductions. As an
across-the-board DR in a system is impractical due to the enrollment budget for
instance, it is necessary to select a small group of nodes for DR implementing.
Current studies resort to intuitive yet naive approaches for DR targeting, as
price is implicitly associated with demand, though optimality cannot be
ensured. In this paper, we derive such a relationship in the
security-constrained economic dispatch via the multi-parametric programming
theory, based on which the DR targeting problem is rigorously formulated as a
mixed-integer quadratic programming problem aiming at reducing the averaged
price to a reference level by efficiently reducing targeted nodes' demand. A
solution strategy is proposed to accelerate the computation. Numerical studies
demonstrate compared with the benchmarking strategy, the proposed approach can
reduce the price to the reference point with less efforts in demand reduction.
Besides, we empirically show that the proposed approach is immune to inaccurate
system parameters, and can be generalized to variants of DR targeting tasks.

properties. Switchability of the resistance states in the memristors have been
found to depend strongly on the VOs concentration in the WO3-x layer. Depending
on x, the memristors exhibited forming-free bipolar, forming-required bipolar

cm-3) exhibited lower initial resistance and memory window of only 15, which
has been increased to ~6500 with reducing VOs concentration to ~5.8*1020 cm-3.
Forming-free, stable RS with memory window of ~2000 have been realized for a

accurately exploit the multi-user interference (MUI) in the multi-user

correct detection, which is the so-called constructive interference (CI). Its
performance superiority comes at the cost of solving a nonlinear optimization
problem on a symbol-by-symbol basis, for which the resulting complexity becomes
prohibitive in realistic wireless communication systems. In this paper, we
investigate low-complexity SLP algorithms for both phase-shift keying (PSK) and
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Specifically, we first prove that the
max-min SINR balancing (SB) SLP problem for PSK signaling is not separable,
which is contrary to the power minimization (PM) SLP problem, and accordingly,
existing decomposition methods are not applicable. Next, we establish an
explicit duality between the PM-SLP and SB-SLP problems for PSK modulation. The
proposed duality facilitates obtaining the solution to the SB-SLP given the
solution to the PM-SLP without the need for one-dimension search, and vice
versa. We then propose a closed-form power scaling algorithm to solve the
SB-SLP via PM-SLP to take advantage of the separability of the PM-SLP. As for
QAM modulation, we convert the PM-SLP problem into a separable equivalent
optimization problem, and decompose the new problem into several simple
parallel subproblems with closed-form solutions, leveraging the proximal
Jacobian alternating direction method of multipliers (PJ-ADMM). We further
prove that the proposed duality can be generalized to the multi-level
modulation case, based on which a power scaling parallel inverse-free algorithm
is also proposed to solve the SB-SLP for QAM signaling. Numerical results show
that the proposed algorithms offer optimal performance with lower complexity
than the state-of-the-art.

body shapes from front and side silhouettes. Most recent silhouette-based
approaches use a deep neural network trained by silhouettes and key points to
estimate the shape parameters but cannot accurately fit the model to the body
contours and consequently are struggling to cover detailed body geometry,
especially in the torso. In addition, in most of these cases, body parts have
the same accuracy priority, making the optimization harder and avoiding
reaching the optimum possible result in essential body parts, like the torso,
which is visually important in most applications, such as virtual garment
fitting. In the proposed method, we can adjust the expected accuracy for each
body part based on our purpose by assigning coefficients for the distance of
each body part between the projected 3D body and 2D silhouettes. To measure
this distance, we first recognize the correspondent body parts using body
segmentation in both views. Then, we align individual body parts by 2D rigid
registration and match them using pairwise matching. The objective function
tries to minimize the distance cost for the individual body parts in both views
based on distances and coefficients by optimizing the statistical model
parameters. We also handle the slight variation in the degree of arms and limbs
by matching the pose. We evaluate the proposed method with synthetic body
meshes from the normalized S-SCAPE. The result shows that the algorithm can
more accurately reconstruct visually important body parts with high

physically-based rendering (PBR) would render low-quality images or videos for
scenes that are constructed by R3DMs. One promising solution would be
representing real-world objects as Neural Fields such as NeRFs, which are able
to generate photo-realistic renderings of an object under desired viewpoints.
However, a drawback is that the synthesized views through Neural Fields
Rendering (NFR) cannot reflect the simulated lighting details on R3DMs in PBR
pipelines, especially when object interactions in the 3D scene creation cause
local shadows. To solve this dilemma, we propose a lighting transfer network

LighTNet reasons about a simplified image composition model, remedies the

classification and slot filling. The success of pre-training language models
resulted in a significant breakthrough in the two tasks. One of the promising
solutions called BERT can jointly optimize the two tasks. We note that
BERT-based models convert each complex token into multiple sub-tokens by
wordpiece algorithm, which generates a mismatch between the lengths of the
tokens and the labels. This leads to BERT-based models do not do well in label
prediction which limits model performance improvement. Many existing models can
be compatible with this issue but some hidden semantic information is discarded
in the fine-tuning process. We address the problem by introducing a novel joint
method on top of BERT which explicitly models the multiple sub-tokens features
after wordpiece tokenization, thereby contributing to the two tasks. Our method
can well extract the contextual features from complex tokens by the proposed
sub-words attention adapter (SAA), which preserves overall utterance
information. Additionally, we propose an intent attention adapter (IAA) to
obtain the full sentence features to aid users to predict intent. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed model is significantly improved on two public
benchmark datasets. In particular, the slot filling F1 score is improved from
96.1 to 98.2 (2.1% absolute) on the Airline Travel Information Systems (ATIS)

polarization, which lifts the degeneracy of the states in the two valleys,

to target individual tumors, particularly for immunotherapy. However, the
methods to assess such properties are expensive, time-consuming, and often not
routinely performed. Applying machine learning to H&E images can provide a more
cost-effective screening method. Dozens of studies over the last few years have
demonstrated that a variety of molecular biomarkers can be predicted from H&E
alone using the advancements of deep learning: molecular alterations, genomic
subtypes, protein biomarkers, and even the presence of viruses. This article
reviews the diverse applications across cancer types and the methodology to
train and validate these models on whole slide images. From bottom-up to
pathologist-driven to hybrid approaches, the leading trends include a variety
of weakly supervised deep learning-based approaches, as well as mechanisms for
training strongly supervised models in select situations. While results of
these algorithms look promising, some challenges still persist, including small
training sets, rigorous validation, and model explainability. Biomarker
prediction models may yield a screening method to determine when to run
molecular tests or an alternative when molecular tests are not possible. They
also create new opportunities in quantifying intratumoral heterogeneity and
predicting patient outcomes.

explanation methods for image-based DNNs: by making small visual changes to the
input image -- hardly influencing the network's output -- we demonstrate how
explanations may be arbitrarily manipulated through the use of evolution
strategies. Our novel algorithm, AttaXAI, a model-agnostic, adversarial attack
on XAI algorithms, only requires access to the output logits of a classifier
and to the explanation map; these weak assumptions render our approach highly
useful where real-world models and data are concerned. We compare our method's

different pretrained deep-learning models: VGG16-CIFAR100, VGG16-ImageNet,
MobileNet-CIFAR100, and Inception-v3-ImageNet. We find that the XAI methods can
be manipulated without the use of gradients or other model internals. Our novel

However, existing DPP approaches suffer from poor performance, high complexity,

novel DPP approach in wideband THz massive MIMO systems. First, the
optimization problem is converted into a compressive sensing (CS) form, which
can be solved by the extended spatially sparse precoding (SSP) algorithm. To
compensate for beam split, frequency-dependent measurement matrices are
introduced, which can be approximately realized by feasible phase and delay

further reduce the complexity of extended SSP. In simulation, the proposed DPP
approach achieves superior performance, complexity, and robustness by using it

surfaces under the hypotheses of quasicompleteness. In particular, we show
that, for $k>\text{Max}(0,-c)$, the only quasicomplete immersed surfaces of
constant extrinsic curvature equal to $k$ in the $3$-dimensional space-form of
constant sectional curvature equal to $c$ are the geodesic spheres. Together
with earlier work of the author, this completes the classification of
quasicomplete immersed surfaces of constant positive extrinsic curvature in
$3$-dimensional space-forms.

makes non-LTE (NLTE) spectral synthesis feasible on a new 3D ab-initio
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) filament/prominence simulation, in a post-processing
step. Methods. We clarify the need to introduce filament/prominent-specific
Lightweaver boundary conditions that accurately model incident chromospheric
radiation, and include a self-consistent and smoothly varying limb darkening
function. Results. Progressing from isothermal/isobaric models to the
self-consistently generated stratifications within a fully 3D MHD
filament/prominence simulation, we find excellent agreement between our 1.5D
non local thermodynamic equilibrium Lightweaver synthesis and a popular
Hydrogen H{\alpha} proxy. We compute additional lines including Ca~\textsc{ii}
8542 alongside the more optically-thick Ca~\textsc{ii} H&K & Mg~\textsc{ii} h&k
lines, for which no comparable proxy exists, and explore their formation
properties within filament/prominence atmospheres. Conclusions. The versatility
of the Lightweaver framework is demonstrated with this extension to 1.5D
filament/prominence models, where each vertical column of the instantaneous 3D
MHD state is spectrally analysed separately, without accounting for (important)
multi-dimensional radiative effects. The general agreement found in the line
core contrast of both observations and the Lightweaver-synthesised simulation
further validates the current generation of solar filaments/prominences models
constructed numerically with MPI-AMRVAC.

outcomes, such as infants with extremely low birth weights. Existing
changes-in-changes (CIC) estimators are tailored to middle quantiles and do not
work well for such subpopulations. This paper proposes a new CIC estimator to
accurately estimate treatment effects at extreme quantiles. With its asymptotic
normality, we also propose a method of statistical inference, which is simple
to implement. Based on simulation studies, we propose to use our extreme CIC
estimator for extreme, such as below 5% and above 95%, quantiles, while the
conventional CIC estimator should be used for intermediate quantiles. Applying
the proposed method, we study the effects of income gains from the 1993 EITC

from blood is important for early diagnosis of the disease. Deep learning
techniques are potent classifiers for AD diagnosis, but most have been unable
to identify biomarkers because of their lack of interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose a pathway information-based neural network
(PINNet) to predict AD patients and analyze blood and brain transcriptomic
signatures using an interpretable deep learning model. PINNet is a deep neural
network (DNN) model with pathway prior knowledge from either the Gene Ontology
or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Then, a
backpropagation-based model interpretation method was applied to reveal
essential pathways and genes for predicting AD. We compared the performance of
PINNet with a DNN model without a pathway. Performances of PINNet outperformed
or were similar to those of DNN without a pathway using blood and brain gene
expressions, respectively. Moreover, PINNet considers more AD-related genes as
essential features than DNN without a pathway in the learning process. Pathway
analysis of protein-protein interaction modules of highly contributed genes
showed that AD-related genes in blood were enriched with cell migration,
PI3K-Akt, MAPK signaling, and apoptosis in blood. The pathways enriched in the
brain module included cell migration, PI3K-Akt, MAPK signaling, apoptosis,
protein ubiquitination, and t-cell activation. Collectively, with prior
knowledge about pathways, PINNet reveals essential pathways related to AD.

is available to the network as well as optimal for the downstream task. Latent
graph inference allows models to dynamically learn the intrinsic graph
structure of problems where the connectivity patterns of data may not be
directly accessible. In this work, we generalize the discrete Differentiable
Graph Module (dDGM) for latent graph learning. The original dDGM architecture
used the Euclidean plane to encode latent features based on which the latent
graphs were generated. By incorporating Riemannian geometry into the model and
generating more complex embedding spaces, we can improve the performance of the
latent graph inference system. In particular, we propose a computationally
tractable approach to produce product manifolds of constant curvature model
spaces that can encode latent features of varying structure. The latent
representations mapped onto the inferred product manifold are used to compute
richer similarity measures that are leveraged by the latent graph learning
model to obtain optimized latent graphs. Moreover, the curvature of the product
manifold is learned during training alongside the rest of the network
parameters and based on the downstream task, rather than it being a static
embedding space. Our novel approach is tested on a wide range of datasets, and
outperforms the original dDGM model.

multi-scale mask attention, which attends to the instrument region and masks

selection of libraries make it the most popular scientific programming
language, so it is a fitting language in which to implement and analyze these
algorithms.
  In this paper, we use Python packages multiprocessing and mpi4py to implement
several different parallel merge sort algorithms. Experiments are conducted on
an academic supercomputer, upon which benchmarks are performed using Cloudmesh.
We find that hybrid multiprocessing merge sort outperforms several other
algorithms, achieving a 1.5x speedup compared to the built-in Python sorted()
and a 34x speedup compared to sequential merge sort. Our results provide
insight into different approaches to implementing parallel merge sort in Python

that is robust to assumptions about the number of sensors, occupancy threshold
(in dBm), sensor noise, number of emitters and the propagation environment. We
show that such a system may be designed with neural networks using a process of
aggregation to allow a variable number of sensors during training and testing.
This process transforms the variable number of measurements into approximate
log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), which are fed as a fixed-resolution image into a
neural network. The use of LLR's provides robustness to the effects of noise
and occupancy threshold. In other words, a system may be trained for a nominal
number of sensors, threshold and noise levels, and still operate well at
various other levels without retraining. Our system operates without knowledge
of the number of emitters and does not explicitly attempt to estimate their
number or power. Receiver operating curves with realistic propagation
environments using topographic maps with commercial network design tools show
how performance of the neural network varies with the environment. The use of
very low-resolution sensors in this system can still yield good performance.
