  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2207.06973",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A novel metric that describes the vulnerability of the measurements in power
systems to data integrity attacks is proposed. The new metric, coined
vulnerability index (VuIx), leverages information theoretic measures to assess
the attack effect on the fundamental limits of the disruption and detection
tradeoff. The result of computing the VuIx of the measurements in the system
yields an ordering of their vulnerability based on the level of exposure to
data integrity attacks. This new framework is used to assess the measurement
vulnerability of IEEE 9-bus and 30-bus test systems and it is observed that
power injection measurements are overwhelmingly more vulnerable to data
integrity attacks than power flow measurements. A detailed numerical evaluation
of the VuIx values for IEEE test systems is provided.

observatory of the European Space Agency. It is formed by 3 spacecraft
exchanging laser beams in order to form multiple real and virtual
interferometers. The data streams to be used in order to extract the large
number and variety of GW sources are Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) data. One
important processing to produce these data is the TDI on-ground processing
which recombines multiple interferometric on-board measurements to remove
certain noise sources from the data such as laser frequency noise or spacecraft
jitter. The LISA noise budget is therefore expressed at the TDI level in order
to account for the different TDI transfer functions applied for each noise
source and thus estimate their real weight on mission performance. In order to
derive a usable form of these transfer functions, a model of the beams, the
measurements, and TDI have been developed, and several approximation have been
made. A methodology for such a derivation has been established, as well as
verification procedures. It results in a set of transfer functions, which are
now used by the LISA project, in particular in its performance model. Using
these transfer functions, realistic noise curves for various instrumental
configurations are provided to data analysis algorithms and used for instrument
design.

to be able to plan a safe maneuver. Towards this goal, modern approaches reason
about the map, the agents' past trajectories and their interactions in order to
produce accurate forecasts. The predominant approach has been to encode the map
and other agents in the reference frame of each target agent. However, this
approach is computationally expensive for multi-agent prediction as inference
needs to be run for each agent. To tackle the scaling challenge, the solution
thus far has been to encode all agents and the map in a shared coordinate frame

domain shift (e.g., when the SDV visits uncommon states). In contrast, in this
paper, we propose an efficient shared encoding for all agents and the map
without sacrificing accuracy or generalization. Towards this goal, we leverage
pair-wise relative positional encodings to represent geometric relationships
between the agents and the map elements in a heterogeneous spatial graph. This
parameterization allows us to be invariant to scene viewpoint, and save online

comparative evolutionary analyses in model and emerging non-model systems.
Understanding complexity and the functional components of the genome is an
untapped wealth of knowledge ripe for exploration. With the ""remarkable lack of
correspondence"" between genome size and complexity, there needs to be a way to
quantify complexity across organisms. In this study we use a set of complexity
metrics that allow for evaluation of changes in complexity using TranD. We
ascertain if complexity is increasing or decreasing across transcriptomes and
at what structural level, as complexity is varied. We define three metrics --
TpG, EpT, and EpG in this study to quantify the complexity of the transcriptome
that encapsulate the dynamics of alternative splicing. Here we compare
complexity metrics across 1) whole genome annotations, 2) a filtered subset of
orthologs, and 3) novel genes to elucidate the impacts of ortholog and novel
genes in transcriptome analysis. We also derive a metric from Hong et al.,
2006, Effective Exon Number (EEN), to compare the distribution of exon sizes
within transcripts against random expectations of uniform exon placement. EEN
accounts for differences in exon size, which is important because novel genes
differences in complexity for orthologs and whole transcriptome analyses are
biased towards low complexity genes with few exons and few alternative
transcripts. With our metric analyses, we are able to implement changes in
complexity across diverse lineages with greater precision and accuracy than
previous cross-species comparisons under ortholog conditioning. These analyses
represent a step forward toward whole transcriptome analysis in the emerging
field of non-model evolutionary genomics, with key insights for evolutionary
inference of complexity changes on deep timescales across the tree of life. We
suggest a means to quantify biases generated in ortholog calling and correct
complexity analysis for lineage-specific effects. With these metrics, we
directly assay the quantitative properties of newly formed lineage-specific
genes as they lower complexity in transcriptomes.

determining their sample size; a too small sample size may lead to inconclusive

combine the original data and external knowledge in a design prior distribution

success may be defined through Bayesian or non-Bayesian criteria, and different

conclusive inferences based on multiple analysis approaches. We investigate

for biologically inspired learning rules for improving current artificial
intelligence technology. Most biological models are composed of point neurons,
and cannot achieve the state-of-the-art performances in machine learning.
Recent works have proposed that segregation of dendritic input (neurons receive
sensory information and higher-order feedback in segregated compartments) and
generation of high-frequency bursts of spikes would support error
backpropagation in biological neurons. However, these approaches require
propagating errors with a fine spatio-temporal structure to the neurons, which
is unlikely to be feasible in a biological network.
  To relax this assumption, we suggest that bursts and dendritic input
segregation provide a natural support for biologically plausible target-based
learning, which does not require error propagation. We propose a pyramidal
neuron model composed of three separated compartments. A coincidence mechanism
between the basal and the apical compartments allows for generating
high-frequency bursts of spikes. This architecture allows for a burst-dependent
learning rule, based on the comparison between the target bursting activity
triggered by the teaching signal and the one caused by the recurrent
connections, providing the support for target-based learning. We show that this
framework can be used to efficiently solve spatio-temporal tasks, such as the
store and recall of 3D trajectories.
  Finally, we suggest that this neuronal architecture naturally allows for
orchestrating ``hierarchical imitation learning'', enabling the decomposition
of challenging long-horizon decision-making tasks into simpler subtasks. This
can be implemented in a two-level network, where the high-network acts as a
``manager'' and produces the contextual signal for the low-network, the
``worker''.

assisted and autonomous vehicles, airplanes and drones, are deeply influenced
by the road-tire friction experienced during the maneuver. Therefore, the
availability of accurate estimation algorithms is of major importance in the
development of advanced control schemes. The focus of this paper is on the
estimation problem. In particular, a novel estimation algorithm is proposed,
based on a multi-layer neural network. The training is based on a synthetic
data set, derived from a widely used friction model. The open loop performances
of the proposed algorithm are evaluated in a number of simulated scenarios.
Moreover, different control schemes are used to test the closed loop scenario,
where the estimated optimal slip is used as the set-point. The experimental
results and the comparison with a model based baseline show that the proposed
approach can provide an effective best slip estimation.

from in situ observations. We also simulate in situ profiles that spacecraft
would have measured at the Earth, and we compare with the results of
statistical studies. We find a good match between simulated in situ profiles

ropes interact with the magnetic field of the wind but still show realistic

optimization (BO) are compared with seven metaheuristics and other baselines on
a set of ten deterministic simulative single-objective tuning problems in
control. Results indicate that deterministic noise, low multimodality, and
substantial areas with infeasible parametrizations (crash constraints)
characterize control engineering tuning problems. Therefore, a flexible method
to handle crash constraints with BO is presented. A resulting increase in
sample efficiency is shown in comparison to standard BO. Furthermore, benchmark
results indicate that pattern search (PS) performs best on a budget of 25 d
objective function evaluations and a problem dimensionality d of d = 2.
Bayesian adaptive direct search, a combination of BO and PS, is shown to be
most sample efficient for 3 <= d <= 5. Using these optimizers instead of random

problems related to flow control. In this work, an ANN trained through a DRL
agent is used to perform active flow control. Two-dimensional simulations of
the flow around a cylinder are conducted and an active control based on two
jets located on the walls of the cylinder is considered. By gathering
information from the flow surrounding the cylinder, the ANN agent is able to
learn effective control strategies for the jets, leading to a significant drag
reduction. In the present work, a Reynolds-number range beyond those previously
considered is studied and compared with results obtained using classical
flow-control methods. Significantly different nature in the control strategies
is identified by the DRL as the Reynolds number Re increases. For Re <= 1000
the classical control strategy based on an opposition control relative to the
wake oscillation is obtained. For Re = 2000 the new strategy consists of an
energisation of the boundary layers and the separation area, which modulate the
flow separation and reduce drag in a fashion similar to that of the drag
crisis, through a high frequency actuation. A cross-application of agents is
performed for a flow at Re = 2000, obtaining similar results in terms of drag
reduction with the agents trained at Re = 1000 and 2000. The fact that two
different strategies yield the same performance make us question whether this
Reynolds number regime (Re = 2000) belongs to a transition towards a
nature-different flow which would only admit a high-frequency actuation
strategy to obtain drag reduction. This finding allows the application of ANNs
trained at lower Reynolds numbers but comparable in nature, saving
computational resources.

these approaches are affected by a severe over-screening error. By using an
out-of-equilibrium Many-Body technique I discuss how to merge the many-body
approach with density-functional perturbation theory in order to correct the
over-screening error. A symmetric statically screened phonon self-energy is
obtained by down-folding the exact Baym-Kadanoff equations. The statically
screened approximation proposed here is shown to have the same long-range
spatial limit of the exact self-energy and to respect the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The doubly screened approximation, commonly
used in the literature, is shown, instead, to be over-screened, to violate
several Many-Body properties and to have a wrong spatial long-range decay. The
accuracy of the proposed approximation is tested against the exact solution of
an extended model Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian and it is applied to a paradigmatic

failure mode are performance drops due to differences between the training and

robustness of machine learning models to such dataset drifts, existing
approaches do not account for explicit models of the primary object of
interest: the data. This limits our ability to study and understand the
relationship between data generation and downstream machine learning model
performance in a physically accurate manner. In this study, we demonstrate how
to overcome this limitation by pairing traditional machine learning with
physical optics to obtain explicit and differentiable data models. We
demonstrate how such data models can be constructed for image data and used to
control downstream machine learning model performance related to dataset drift.
The findings are distilled into three applications. First, drift synthesis
enables the controlled generation of physically faithful drift test cases to
power model selection and targeted generalization. Second, the gradient
connection between machine learning task model and data model allows advanced,
precise tolerancing of task model sensitivity to changes in the data
generation. These drift forensics can be used to precisely specify the
acceptable data environments in which a task model may be run. Third, drift

summarization have achieved high correlations with human judgment, but they do
not account for the vision modality and thus are not adequate for
vision-and-language summarization. We propose CLIPBERTScore, a simple weighted
combination of CLIPScore and BERTScore to leverage the robustness and strong
factuality detection performance between image-summary and document-summary,
respectively. Next, due to the lack of meta-evaluation benchmarks to evaluate
the quality of multimodal factuality metrics, we collect human judgments of
factuality with respect to documents and images. We show that this simple
combination of two metrics in the zero-shot setting achieves higher
correlations than existing factuality metrics for document summarization,
outperforms an existing multimodal summarization metric, and performs
competitively with strong multimodal factuality metrics specifically fine-tuned
for the task. Our thorough analysis demonstrates the robustness and high
correlation of CLIPBERTScore and its components on four factuality
metric-evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we demonstrate two practical downstream
applications of our CLIPBERTScore metric: for selecting important images to
focus on during training, and as a reward for reinforcement learning to improve
factuality of multimodal summary generation w.r.t automatic and human

scenario. The ASG approach is introduced by implementing gravitational and
cosmological running coupling constants directly in the black string metric. We
calculate the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity of the improved
black string metric in two cases: considering the cosmological constant fixed
in some fixed point and the general case where both Newton's constant and
cosmological constant are improved. For the identification of the scale moment
we used an general inverse law setting $k(r)\sim 1/r^{n}$. We show that
improving only the Newton's constant the problem of singularity is solved for
the identifications with $n>1$. However, if the cosmological constant is also
running the singularity persists in the solution. Also, we show that the ASG
effects predicts the presence of a remnant mass in the final evaporation
process. Besides that, a logarithmic correction is observed in the entropy.
However, a running cosmological constant introduces new correction terms to the
entropy beyond that. We show that the improved black string solution remains
stable, as in the usual case. Phase transitions are not observed in both cases
studied here.

density perturbations have recently attracted a lot of attention because the
amplified perturbations can seed a sizable amount of primordial black holes
(PBHs) and stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). While the power
spectra in these models are computed based on the linear equation of motion, it
is not obvious whether loop corrections are negligible when such a large
amplification occurs during inflation. In this paper, as a first step to
discuss the loop corrections in such models, we use the in-in formalism and
calculate the one-loop scalar power spectrum numerically and analytically in an
illustrative model where the density perturbations are resonantly amplified due
to oscillatory features in the inflaton potential. Our calculation is
technically new in that the amplified perturbations are numerically taken into
account in the in-in formalism for the first time. In arriving at our
analytical estimates, we highlight the role that the Wronskian condition of
perturbations, automatically satisfied in our model, plays in obtaining the
correct estimates. In addition, the analytical estimates show that the
contribution originating from the quantum nature of the perturbations in the
loop can be dominant. We also discuss the necessary conditions for subdominant
loop corrections in this model. We find that, for the typical parameter space
leading to the $\mathcal O(10^7)$ amplification of the power spectrum required
for a sufficient PBH production, the one-loop power spectrum dominates over the
tree-level one, indicating the breakdown of the perturbation theory.

asymptotic analytic solutions and idealized 2D simulations have shown that
laminar flow solutions can transport heat even more efficiently, with $Nu \sim
Ra$. The turbulent nature of the flow thus has a profound impact on its
transport properties. In the present contribution we give this statement a
precise mathematical sense. We show that the Nusselt number maximized over all
solutions is bounded from above by const.$\times Ra$, before restricting
attention to 'fully turbulent branches of solutions', defined as families of
solutions characterized by a finite nonzero limit of the dissipation
coefficient at large driving amplitude. Maximization of $Nu$ over such branches
of solutions yields the better upper-bound $Nu \lesssim \sqrt{Ra}$. We then
provide 3D numerical and experimental data of CISS compatible with a finite
limiting value of the dissipation coefficient at large driving amplitude. It
thus seems that CISS achieves the maximal heat transport scaling over fully

an enhanced level of patient care and safety. In this paper, we show the first
medical robot that autonomously navigates a needle inside living tissue around
anatomical obstacles to an intra-tissue target. Our system leverages an aiming
device and a laser-patterned highly flexible steerable needle, a type of needle
capable of maneuvering along curvilinear trajectories to avoid obstacles. The
autonomous robot accounts for anatomical obstacles and uncertainty in living
tissue/needle interaction with replanning and control and accounts for
respiratory motion by defining safe insertion time windows during the breathing
cycle. We apply the system to lung biopsy, which is critical in the diagnosis
of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.

for understanding the role of dust in astrophysical systems and its influence

non-linear and such simulations are computationally expensive in case of
realistic 3D inhomogeneous dust distributions. We explore a novel technique for
post-processing MCRT output to reduce the total computational run time by
enhancing the output of computationally less expensive simulations of
lower-quality.
  Methods. We combine principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) as dimensionality reduction techniques together with
Gaussian Markov random fields and the Integrated nested Laplace approximation
(INLA), an approximate method for Bayesian inference, to detect and reconstruct
the non-random spatial structure in the images of lower signal-to-noise or with

  Results. We test our methodology using synthetic observations of a galaxy

that only 24 light curves in 7 sources are significantly variable. In order to
characterise the origin of X-ray variability in these blazars, we fit the flux
distributions of all these light curves using Gaussian and lognormal
distributions, as any non-Gaussian perturbation could indicate the imprints of
fluctuations in the accretion disc, which could be Doppler boosted through the
relativistic jets in blazars. However, intra-day variability, as seen in our
observations, is difficult to reconcile using disc components as the emissions
in such sources are mostly dominated by jets. We used Anderson-Darling (AD) and
$\chi^{2}$ tests to fit the histograms. In 11 observations of 4 blazars,
namely, ON 231, 3C 273, PKS 0235+164 and PKS 0521-365, both models equally fit
the flux distributions. In the rest of the observations, we are unable to model
them with any distribution. In two sources, namely, BL Lacertae and S4
0954+650, the lognormal distribution is preferred over the normal distribution,
which could arise from non-Gaussian perturbations from relativistic jets or
linear Gaussian perturbation in the particle time scale leading to such flux

statistically significant results fail to replicate in subsequent experiments.
We show that this problem arises because standard `point-form null'
significance tests consider only within-experiment but ignore
between-experiment variation, and so systematically underestimate the degree of
random variation in results. We give an extension to standard significance
testing that addresses this problem by analysing both within- and
between-experiment variation. This `distributional null' approach does not
underestimate experimental variability and so is not overconfident in
identifying significance; because this approach addresses between-experiment
variation, it gives mathematically coherent estimates for the probability of
replication of significant results. Using a large-scale replication dataset
(the first `Many Labs' project), we show that many experimental results that
appear statistically significant in standard tests are in fact consistent with
random variation when both within- and between-experiment variation are taken
into account in this approach. Further, grouping experiments in this dataset
into `predictor-target' pairs we show that the predicted replication
probabilities for target experiments produced in this approach (given predictor
experiment results and the sample sizes of the two experiments) are strongly
correlated with observed replication rates. Distributional null hypothesis
testing thus gives researchers a statistical tool for identifying statistically
significant and reliably replicable results.

oscillation models involving light sterile neutrinos. In the commonly-used 3+1
plane wave model, there is a well-known 4.9$\sigma$ tension between data sets
sensitive to appearance versus disappearance of neutrinos. We find that models
that damp the oscillation prediction for the reactor data sets, especially at
low energy, substantially improve the fits and reduce the tension. We consider
two such scenarios. The first scenario introduces the quantum mechanical
wavepacket effect that accounts for the source size in reactor experiments into
the 3+1 model. We find that inclusion of the wavepacket effect greatly improves
the overall fit compared to a 3$\nu$ model by $\Delta \chi^2/$DOF$=61.1/4$
($7.1\sigma$ improvement) with best-fit $\Delta m^2=1.4$ eV$^2$ and wavepacket
length of 67fm. The internal tension is reduced to 3.4$\sigma$. If reactor-data
only is fit, then the wavepacket preferred length is 91 fm ($>20$ fm at 99\%
CL). The second model introduces oscillations involving sterile flavor and
allows the decay of the heaviest, mostly sterile mass state, $\nu_4$. This
model introduces a damping term similar to the wavepacket effect, but across
all experiments. Compared to a three-neutrino fit, this has a $\Delta
\chi^2/$DOF$=60.6/4$ ($7\sigma$ improvement) with preferred $\Delta m^2=1.4$
eV$^2$ and decay $\Gamma = 0.35$ eV$^2$. The internal tension is reduced to
3.7$\sigma$.
  For many years, the reactor event rates have been observed to have structure
that deviates from prediction. Community discussion has focused on an excess
compared to prediction observed at 5 MeV; however, other deviations are
apparent. This structure has $L$ dependence that is well-fit by the damped
models. Before assuming this points to new physics, we urge closer examination
of systematic effects that could lead to this $L$ dependence.

hydrophobic compound rhodamine 6G (R6G). The quantitative analysis of R6G
concentration is obtained from 10^-5 to 10^-11 M. In addition, for a model
micro-pollutant in water triclosan, the detection limit of 10^-6 M is achieved
by using microliter sample solutions. The intensity of SERS detection in this
approach is robust to the dispersity of the nanoparticles in the drop but
became stronger after a longer drying time. The ultrasensitive detection
mechanism is the sequential process of concentration, extraction, and
absorption of the analyte during evaporation of self-lubrication drop and hot
spot generation for intensification of SERS signals. This novel approach for
sample preparation in ultrasensitive SERS detection can be applied to the
detection of chemical and biological signatures in areas such as environment

the interdisciplinary study of quantum machine learning. Sequential modeling is
an important task with high scientific and commercial value. Existing VQC or
QNN-based methods require significant computational resources to perform the
gradient-based optimization of a larger number of quantum circuit parameters.
The major drawback is that such quantum gradient calculation requires a large
amount of circuit evaluation, posing challenges in current near-term quantum
hardware and simulation software. In this work, we approach sequential modeling
by applying a reservoir computing (RC) framework to quantum recurrent neural
networks (QRNN-RC) that are based on classical RNN, LSTM and GRU. The main idea
to this RC approach is that the QRNN with randomly initialized weights is
treated as a dynamical system and only the final classical linear layer is
trained. Our numerical simulations show that the QRNN-RC can reach results
comparable to fully trained QRNN models for several function approximation and
time series prediction tasks. Since the QRNN training complexity is
significantly reduced, the proposed model trains notably faster. In this work
we also compare to corresponding classical RNN-based RC implementations and
show that the quantum version learns faster by requiring fewer training epochs
in most cases. Our results demonstrate a new possibility to utilize quantum
neural network for sequential modeling with greater quantum hardware
efficiency, an important design consideration for noisy intermediate-scale

is considered inevitable to resort to non-perturbative methods at the price of
treating the system semiclassically. We show that a fully quantum perturbative
treatment, in which the background is resolved as a multi-particle state,
recovers the semiclassical non-perturbative results and allows going beyond. We
reproduce particle-creation by a classical field in a theory of two scalars as
well as in scalar QED in terms of scattering processes of high multiplicity.
The multi-particle treatment also gives a transparent picture of why a
single-process transition from a classical to a quantum state, which we call
quantumization, is exponentially suppressed, whereas the opposite process,
classicalization, can take place swiftly if the microstate degeneracy of the
classical state is high. An example is provided by the $N$-graviton portrait of
a black hole: a black hole can form efficiently via a $2\to N$ classicalization
process in the collision of high-energy particles but its quantumization via a
decay $N \to 2$ is exponentially suppressed.

There are
two popular CL settings, class incremental learning (CIL) and task incremental
learning (TIL). A major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting (CF). While
a number of techniques are already available to effectively overcome CF for
TIL, CIL remains to be highly challenging. So far, little theoretical study has
been done to provide a principled guidance on how to solve the CIL problem.
This paper performs such a study. It first shows that probabilistically, the
CIL problem can be decomposed into two sub-problems: Within-task Prediction
(WP) and Task-id Prediction (TP). It further proves that TP is correlated with
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which connects CIL and OOD detection. The
key conclusion of this study is that regardless of whether WP and TP or OOD
detection are defined explicitly or implicitly by a CIL algorithm, good WP and
good TP or OOD detection are necessary and sufficient for good CIL
performances. Additionally, TIL is simply WP. Based on the theoretical result,
new CIL methods are also designed, which outperform strong baselines in both
CIL and TIL settings by a large margin.

increase of L$_X$ with M$_*$. The L$_X$/SFR ratio has a weak dependence on
M$_*$, and at fixed M$_*$ it is highest in Q systems. The latter trend is
mostly driven by the significant drop in SFR in the Q state. The measured
strong variations in SFR from the SB/SF to Q mirror those predicted in merger

variance with the same models. We also study the evolution of SFR for a galaxy

dynamical evolution. We found that the inner stellar density profile
significantly deviates from a King model while is well reproduced by a steep
cusp with a power-law slope alpha=-0.89, thus implying that the cluster is
currently in the post core-collapse (PCC) phase. This is also confirmed by the
very high segregation level of the BSS population measured through the A+
parameter. We also found that the distribution of BSSs in the color-magnitude
diagram is characterized by a collimated blue sequence and a red more sparse
component, as already observed in other three PCC clusters. The comparison with
appropriate collisional models demonstrates that the vast majority of the BSSs
lying along the collimated blue sequence is consistent with a generation of
coeval (1 Gyr-old) stars with different masses originated by an event that
highly enhanced the collisional rate of the system (i.e. the core collapse).
This study confirms that the segregation level of BSSs is a powerful dynamical
diagnostic also of star cluster in a very advanced stage of dynamical
evolution. Moreover, it pushes forward the possibility of using the morphology
of the BSS in the color-magnitude diagram as a tracer of the core-collapse and
subsequent dynamical evolutionary phases.

perturbations on the stability of rotating black strings, focusing on the six
dimensional equal-spinning Myers-Perry black string. We find that rapidly
rotating black strings are unstable to gravitational superradiant modes within
a bounded range of string lengths. The instability occurs because momentum
along the string direction creates a potential barrier that allows for the
confinement of superradiant modes. Yet, five dimensional Myers-Perry black
holes do not have stable particle orbits so, unlike other known superradiant
systems, these black strings remain stable to perturbations with sufficiently
high azimuthal mode number -- this is a `finite-$m$' superradiant instability.
For some parameters, this instability competes with the Gregory-Laflamme
instability, but otherwise exists independently. The onset of this instability
is degenerate and branches to multiple steady-state solutions. This paper is
the first of a trilogy: in the next two, we construct two distinct families of
rotating strings emerging from the superradiant onset (the `black resonator
strings' and `helical black strings'). We argue that similar physics is present
in 5-dimensional Kerr black strings, but not in $D>6$ equal-spinning

adopting -- due to current quantum-hardware limitations -- a single-site
(zero-dimensional) version of the scalar Yukawa-coupling model as our point of
departure, we design low-depth quantum circuits that emulate its dynamics with
up to three bosons. In particular, using advanced circuit-optimization
techniques, in the one-boson case we demonstrate circuit compression, i.e.
design a shallow (constant-depth) circuit that contains only two CNOT gates,
regardless of the total simulation time. In the three-boson case -- where such
a compression is not possible -- we design a circuit in which one Trotter step
entails 8 CNOTs, this number being far below the maximal CNOT-cost of a generic

also provide a CNOT-cost estimate for quantum circuits emulating the system
dynamics for higher boson-number truncations. Finally, based on the proposed
circuits for one- and three-boson cases, we quantify the system dynamics for
several different initial states by evaluating the expected fermion- and boson
numbers at an arbitrary time after the quench. We validate our results by
finding their good agreement with the exact ones obtained through classical

degrees of strain, the effect is amplified by the inverse twist angle, e.g., by
a factor of 50 in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Samples of TBG
typically have heterostrains of 0.1-0.7%, increasing the bandwidth of the
""flat'' bands by as much as tenfold, placing TBG in an intermediate coupling
regime. Here we study the phase diagram of TBG in the presence of heterostrain
with unbiased, large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations
(bond dimension $\chi=24576$), including all spin and valley degrees of
freedom. Working at filling $\nu = -3$, we find a strain of $0.05\%$ drives a
transition from a quantized anomalous Hall insulator into an
incommensurate-Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) phase. This peculiar order, proposed and
studied at mean-field level by Kwan et al (PRX 11, 041063), breaks both valley
conservation and translation symmetry $\hat{T}$, but preserves a modified
translation symmetry $\hat{T}'$ with moir\'e-incommensurate phase modulation.
Even higher strains drive the system to a fully symmetric metal.

By observing that rounding and partitioning of $\mathbb{R}^d$ are equivalent,
we introduce the following natural partition problem which we call the {\em
secluded hypercube partition problem}: Given $k\in \mathbb{N}$ (ideally small)
and $\epsilon>0$ (ideally large), is there a partition of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with
unit hypercubes such that for every point $p \in \mathbb{R}^d$, its closed
$\epsilon$-neighborhood (in the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm) intersects at most $k$
hypercubes?
  We undertake a comprehensive study of this partition problem. We prove that
for every $d\in \mathbb{N}$, there is an explicit (and efficiently computable)
hypercube partition of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $k = d+1$ and $\epsilon =
\frac{1}{2d}$. We complement this construction by proving that the value of
$k=d+1$ is the best possible (for any $\epsilon$) for a broad class of
``reasonable'' partitions including hypercube partitions. We also investigate
the optimality of the parameter $\epsilon$ and prove that any partition in this
broad class that has $k=d+1$, must have $\epsilon\leq\frac{1}{2\sqrt{d}}$.
These bounds imply limitations of certain deterministic rounding schemes
existing in the literature. Furthermore, this general bound is based on the
currently known lower bounds for the dissection number of the cube, and
improvements to this bound will yield improvements to our bounds.
  While our work is motivated by the desire to understand rounding algorithms,
one of our main conceptual contributions is the introduction of the {\em
secluded hypercube partition problem}, which fits well with a long history of
investigations by mathematicians on various hypercube partitions/tilings of
Euclidean space.

TCP. Away from it, nonwetting prevails and no wetting transition takes place,
not even when a critical endpoint is approached. Far from the TCP, reentrant
wetting may occur, with a different wetting phase. These findings shed light on

the process of maintaining the document and detecting conflicts between

remains difficult to describe in general; we study this group in detail in the

transforms on Chow rings of abelian varieties over any field. They allow us to
prove the integral Hodge conjecture for one-cycles on complex Jacobian
varieties, and the real integral Hodge conjecture modulo torsion for real
abelian threefolds.
  For the theory of real algebraic cycles, and for several other purposes in
real algebraic geometry, it is useful to have moduli spaces of real varieties

insight in the geometry of a real variety that defines a point in it, and the
other way around. In the moduli space of real abelian varieties, as well as in
the Torelli locus contained in it, we prove density of the set of moduli points

F475W-passband and the F850LP-passband is on average smaller in the ACSVCS. (3)
The distribution of the LMXBs with the luminosity of the GCs is different
between both surveys. These findings are significant. The first finding could
be a consequence of a wider spread in the distances of the GCs in the ACSVCS,
but the others must have internal reasons in the GCs. Thus, the GC systems are
also different on a galaxy cluster scale.

supervised fine-tuning, has shown impressive quality improvements on automatic
speech recognition (ASR) tasks. Fine-tuning separate foundation models for many
downstream tasks are expensive since the foundation model is usually very big.
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g. adapter, sparse update methods)
offer an alternative paradigm where a small set of parameters are updated to
adapt the foundation model to new tasks. However, these methods still suffer
from a high computational memory cost and slow training speed because they
require backpropagation through the entire neural network at each step. In the
paper, we analyze the performance of features at different layers of a
foundation model on the speech recognition task and propose a novel
hierarchical feature fusion method for resource-efficient transfer learning
from speech foundation models. Experimental results show that the proposed
method can achieve better performance on speech recognition task than existing
algorithms with fewer number of trainable parameters, less computational memory
cost and faster training speed. After combining with Adapters at all layers,
the proposed method can achieve the same performance as fine-tuning the whole
model with $97\%$ fewer trainable encoder parameters and $53\%$ faster training
speed.

optimization problems on disk graphs, a common generalization of both planar
graphs and unit-disk graphs. Our main contribution is a general framework for
designing efficient polynomial-time approximation schemes (EPTASes) for
vertex-deletion problems on disk graphs, which results in EPTASes for many
problems including Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Small Cycle Hitting (in
particular, Triangle Hitting), $P_k$-Hitting for $k\in\{3,4,5\}$, Path
Deletion, Pathwidth $1$-Deletion, Component Order Connectivity, Bounded Degree
Deletion, Pseudoforest Deletion, Finite-Type Component Deletion, etc. All
EPTASes obtained using our framework are robust in the sense that they do not
require a realization of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, prior
to this work, the only problems known to admit (E)PTASes on disk graphs are
Maximum Clique, Independent Set, Dominating set, and Vertex Cover, among which
the existing PTAS [Erlebach et al., SICOMP'05] and EPTAS [Leeuwen, SWAT'06] for
Vertex Cover require a realization of the input disk graph (while ours does
not).
  The core of our framework is a reduction for a broad class of (approximation)
vertex-deletion problems from (general) disk graphs to disk graphs of bounded
local radius, which is a new invariant of disk graphs introduced in this work.
Disk graphs of bounded local radius can be viewed as a mild generalization of
planar graphs, which preserves certain nice properties of planar graphs.
Specifically, we prove that disk graphs of bounded local radius admit the
Excluded Grid Minor property and have locally bounded treewidth. This allows
existing techniques for designing approximation schemes on planar graphs (e.g.,
bidimensionality and Baker's technique) to be directly applied to disk graphs
of bounded local radius.

explicit statements of such advantages and their respective conditions are

the sampling positions are known, with grid deviations generated i.i.d. from a

compressive sampling, an effective paradigm for undersampling and

$s$-sparse representation in some transform domain, we show that
$\mathcal{O}(s\log N)$ random off-the-grid samples are sufficient to recover an

comparison to equispaced sampling where $\mathcal{O}(N)$ measurements are
needed for the same quality of reconstruction (Nyquist-Shannon sampling
theorem). We further consider noise attenuation via oversampling (relative to a
desired bandwidth), a standard technique with limited theoretical understanding

(DSD), a framework that applies deep learning-based surrogate modeling to
accelerate the docking process substantially. DSD can be interpreted as a
formalism of several earlier surrogate prefiltering techniques, adding novel
metrics and practical training practices. Specifically, we show that graph

attaining more accurate and stable performance by allowing the model to filter
out irrelevant information from data more efficiently. Through extensive

layer mobility procedure outperforms the existing handover mechanisms with
respect to radio communication reliability at the expense of higher number of

enabling a complete description of the microscopic state. In these bidisperse
size mixtures, particle interactions are non-additive because interfacial
pinning to the droplet surface causes the equators of differently sized
particles to lie in separate planes. By varying the size ratio we control the
extent of non-additivity in order to achieve phase behavior inaccessible to
additive 2D systems. Across the range of size ratios we tune the system from a
mobile small-particle phase ($\sigma<0.24$), to an interstitial solid
($0.24<\sigma<0.33$), to a disordered glass ($\sigma>0.33$). These distinct
phase regimes are classified through measurements of hexagonal ordering of the
large-particle host lattice and the lattice's capacity for small-particle
transport. Altogether, we explain these structural and dynamic trends by
considering the combined influence of interparticle interactions and the
colloidal packing geometry. Our measurements are reproduced in molecular
dynamics simulations of 2D non-additive disks, suggesting an efficient method
for describing confined systems with reduced dimensionality representations.

The overall premise of this strategy is to reduce the overall sampling costs by
querying inexpensive low-fidelity sources whose data are correlated with
high-fidelity samples. Here, we propose a multi-fidelity cost-aware BO
framework that dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art technologies in

simultaneously learn from an ensemble of multi-fidelity datasets, but also
identify the severely biased low-fidelity sources that should be excluded from

intelligent actions based on the visual feedback from their environment.
Understanding when these controllers might lead to system safety violations is
important for their integration in safety-critical applications and engineering
corrective safety measures for the system. Existing methods leverage
simulation-based testing (or falsification) to find the failures of
vision-based controllers, i.e., the visual inputs that lead to closed-loop
safety violations. However, these techniques do not scale well to the scenarios
involving high-dimensional and complex visual inputs, such as RGB images. In
this work, we cast the problem of finding closed-loop vision failures as a
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability problem. Our approach blends simulation-based
analysis with HJ reachability methods to compute an approximation of the
backward reachable tube (BRT) of the system, i.e., the set of unsafe states for
the system under vision-based controllers. Utilizing the BRT, we can tractably
and systematically find the system states and corresponding visual inputs that
lead to closed-loop failures. These visual inputs can be subsequently analyzed
to find the input characteristics that might have caused the failure. Besides
its scalability to high-dimensional visual inputs, an explicit computation of
BRT allows the proposed approach to capture non-trivial system failures that
are difficult to expose via random simulations. We demonstrate our framework on
two case studies involving an RGB image-based neural network controller for (a)
autonomous indoor navigation, and (b) autonomous aircraft taxiing.

Magnetic impurities and defects break time-reversal invariance and,
consequently, time-reversal invariant (TRI) topological superconductors are
fragile against this type of disorder. Non-magnetic impurities, however,
preserve time-reversal symmetry and one naively expects a TRI topological
superconductor to persist in the presence of non-magnetic impurities. In this
work, we study the effect of non-magnetic disorder on a TRI topological

interface of an Fe-based superconductor and a strongly spin-orbit coupled
Rashba layer. We model two different types of non-magnetic random disorder and
analyze both the bulk density of states and edge state spectrum. Contrary to
naive expectations, we find that the disorder strongly affects the topological
phase by closing the energy gap, while trivial superconducting phases remain
stable and fully gapped. The disorder phase diagram reveals a strong expansion
of a nodal phase with increasing disorder. We further show the decay of the
helical Majorana edge states in the topological phase and how they eventually
disappear with increasing disorder. These results alter our understanding of

fragile topological bands in the spectrum of a twisted kagome elastic lattice
with three-fold rotational symmetry, in the so-called self-dual configuration.
A necessary requirement is that the lattice is a structural metamaterial, in
which the role of the hinges is played by elastic finite-thickness ligaments.
The interplay between the edge modes appearing in the bandgaps bounding the

control signals vary continuously in time. In our algorithm, the classical data
is transformed into the parameters of the time-varying Hamiltonian of the

control parameters of the Hamiltonian. We performed numerical simulations that
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for performing binary and
multi-class classification on linearly inseparable datasets such as concentric
circles and MNIST digits. Our classifier can reach accuracy comparable with the
best classical classifiers. We find the performance of our classifier can be
increased by increasing the number of qubits until the performance saturates
and fluctuates. Moreover, the number of optimization parameters of our
classifier scales linearly with the number of qubits. The increase of number of
training parameters when the size increases is therefore not as fast as that of
neural network. Our algorithm presents the possibility of using current quantum

useful to explore quantum advantage in quantum machine learning.

intermittent particle rearrangements. Under the action of these fluctuations,
the raft transitions from a predominantly quiescent, crystalline structure, to
a two-dimensional liquid-like state. We show that this transition is
characterized by dynamic heterogeneity and intermittency, as well as
cooperative particle movements, that produce an effectively `cageless' crystal.
These findings shed light on fluid-coupling driven excitations that are
difficult to isolate and control in many other hydrodynamic systems.

physical cosmology, especially in the context of the observational evidence for
the recent acceleration of the universe, which demonstrates that canonical
theories of cosmology and particle physics are incomplete and that there is new
physics still to be discovered. Cosmography is a phenomenological approach to
cosmology, where (with some caveats) physical quantities are expanded as a
Taylor series in the cosmological redshift $z$, or analogous parameters such as
the rescaled redshift $y=z/(1+z)$ or the logarithmic redshift $x=\ln{(1+z)}$.
Moreover, the redshift drift of objects following cosmological expansion
provides a model-independent observable, detectable by facilities currently
under construction, {\it viz.} the Extremely Large Telescope and the Square
Kilometre Array Observatory (at least in its full configuration). Here we use
simulated redshift drift measurements from the two facilities to carry out an
assessment of the cosmological impact and model discriminating power of
redshift drift cosmography. We find that the combination of measurements from
the two facilities can provide a stringent test of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm,
and that overall the logarithmic based expansions of the spectroscopic velocity
drift are the most reliable ones, performing better than analogous expansions
in the redshift or the rescaled redshift: the former nominally gives the
smaller error bars for the cosmographic coefficients but is vulnerable to
biases in the higher order terms (in other words, it is only reliable at low
redshifts), while the latter always performs poorly.

known about mean response time. In simpler settings, such as various known-size
single-server-job settings, minimizing mean response time is merely a matter of
prioritizing small jobs. However, for the multiserver-job system, prioritizing
small jobs is not enough, because we must also ensure servers are not
unnecessarily left idle. Thus, minimizing mean response time requires
prioritizing small jobs while simultaneously maximizing throughput. Our
question is how to achieve these joint objectives.
  We devise the ServerFilling-SRPT scheduling policy, which is the first policy
to minimize mean response time in the multiserver-job model in the heavy

empirical evidence that ServerFilling-SRPT outperforms all existing scheduling

subject to prescribed bounds on the classical or generalized familywise error
probabilities. It is not required that the exact number of signals be a priori
known, only upper bounds on the number of signals and noises are assumed
instead. A decentralized formulation is adopted, according to which the sample
size and the decision for each testing problem must be based only on
observations from the corresponding data stream. A novel multistage testing
procedure is proposed for this problem and is shown to enjoy a high-dimensional
asymptotic optimality property. Specifically, it achieves the optimal, average
over all streams, expected sample size, uniformly in the true number of
signals, as the maximum possible numbers of signals and noises go to infinity
at arbitrary rates, in the class of all sequential tests with the same global
error control. In contrast, existing multistage tests in the literature are
shown to achieve this high-dimensional asymptotic optimality property only
under additional sparsity or symmetry conditions. These results are based on an
asymptotic analysis for the fundamental binary testing problem as the two error
probabilities go to zero. For this problem, unlike existing multistage tests in
the literature, the proposed test achieves the optimal expected sample size
under both hypotheses, in the class of all sequential tests with the same error
control, as the two error probabilities go to zero at arbitrary rates. These
results are further supported by simulation studies and extended to problems

text mining are introduced then a new classification system for the Arabic

The distribution of genus across all the embeddings of a graph is only known
explicitly for a few graphs. In order to study these genus distributions,
[Gross et al., European J. Combin. 2016] introduced local genus distributions.
These describe how the faces are distributed around a single vertex across all
the embeddings of a graph. Not much is known about the local or non-local genus
distributions for general graphs.
  [F{\'e}ray, 2015] noted that it is possible to study local genus
distributions by studying the product of conjugacy classes $C_n C_\lambda$. We
therefore start by showing a central limit theorem on this product. We show
that the difference between $C_n C_\lambda$ and the uniform distribution on all
even/odd permutations is at most the number of fixed points in $\lambda$ plus
one, divided by $\sqrt{n-1}$. This can be thought of as an analogue of a result
of [Chmutov and Pittel, Adv. Appl. Math. 2016], who show a similar result for
the product $C_{2^n} C_\lambda$.
  We use this to show that any graph with large vertex degrees and a small
average number of faces has an asymptotically uniform local genus distribution
at each of its vertices. Then, we study the whole genus distribution of the
complete graph. We show that a portion of the complete graph of size
$(1-o(1))|K_n|$ has the same genus distribution as the set of all permutations,
up to parity.

design multiple testing procedures controlling the false discovery rate (FDR)

as Knockoffs and conditional randomization tests, achieve the first goal of
finite-sample FDR control under the assumption of known covariates
distribution. However, it is not clear whether these methods can concurrently
achieve the second goal of maximizing the number of discoveries. In fact,
designing procedures to discover more relevant variables with finite-sample FDR
control is a largely open question, even in the arguably simplest linear
models.
  In this paper, we derive near-optimal testing procedures in high dimensional
Bayesian linear models with isotropic covariates. We propose a Model-X multiple
testing procedure, PoEdCe, which provably controls the frequentist FDR from
finite samples even under model misspecification, and conjecturally achieves
near-optimal power when the data follow the Bayesian linear model with a known
prior. PoEdCe has three important ingredients: Posterior Expectation, distilled
Conditional randomization test (dCRT), and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
with e-values (eBH). The optimality conjecture of PoEdCe is based on a
heuristic calculation of its asymptotic true positive proportion (TPP) and
false discovery proportion (FDP), which is supported by methods from
statistical physics as well as extensive numerical simulations. Furthermore,
when the prior is unknown, we show that an empirical Bayes variant of PoEdCe
still has finite-sample FDR control and achieves near-optimal power.

that data is distributed and with multiple individual sources (referred to as
``clients'' in some studies). Integrating raw data, although powerful, is often
not feasible, for example, when there are considerations on privacy protection.
Distributed learning techniques have been developed to integrate summary
statistics as opposed to raw data. In many of the existing distributed learning
studies, it is stringently assumed that all the clients have the same model. To
accommodate data heterogeneity, some federated learning methods allow for
client-specific models. In this article, we consider the scenario that clients
form clusters, those in the same cluster have the same model, and different
clusters have different models. Further considering the clustering structure
can lead to a better understanding of the ``interconnections'' among clients
and reduce the number of parameters. To this end, we develop a novel
penalization approach. Specifically, group penalization is imposed for
regularized estimation and selection of important variables, and fusion
penalization is imposed to automatically cluster clients. An effective ADMM
algorithm is developed, and the estimation, selection, and clustering
consistency properties are established under mild conditions. Simulation and
data analysis further demonstrate the practical utility and superiority of the
proposed approach.

antiferromagnetic properties of the layered semiconductor CrSBr through
hydrostatic pressure and ligand substitution. Hydrostatic pressure compresses
the unit cell, increasing the interlayer exchange energy while lowering the
N\'eel temperature. Ligand substitution, realized synthetically through Cl
alloying, anisotropically compresses the unit cell and suppresses the
Cr-halogen covalency, reducing the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and
decreasing the N\'eel temperature. A detailed structural analysis combined with
first-principles calculations reveal that alterations in the magnetic
properties are intricately related to changes in direct Cr-Cr exchange
interactions and the Cr-anion superexchange pathways. Further, we demonstrate
that Cl alloying enables chemical tuning of the interlayer coupling from
antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, which is unique amongst known
two-dimensional magnets. The magnetic tunability, combined with a high ordering
temperature, chemical stability, and functional semiconducting properties, make
CrSBr an ideal candidate for pre- and post-synthetic design of magnetism in

architecture which is searched through the classification task is sub-optimal
because of the gap between the task of image and object detection. As while
work focuses on backbone network architecture search for mobile device object
detection is limited, mainly because the backbone always requires expensive
ImageNet pre-training. Accordingly, it is necessary to study the approach of
network architecture search for mobile device object detection without
expensive pre-training. In this work, we propose a mobile object detection
backbone network architecture search algorithm which is a kind of evolutionary
optimized method based on non-dominated sorting for NAS scenarios. It can
quickly search to obtain the backbone network architecture within certain
constraints. It better solves the problem of suboptimal linear combination
accuracy and computational cost. The proposed approach can search the backbone
networks with different depths, widths, or expansion sizes via a technique of
weight mapping, making it possible to use NAS for mobile devices detection
tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness
of the proposed approach on YoloX-Lite, a lightweight version of the target
detection framework. Under similar computational complexity, the accuracy of
the backbone network architecture we search for is 2.0% mAP higher than
MobileDet. Our improved backbone network can reduce the computational effort
while improving the accuracy of the object detection network. To prove its
effectiveness, a series of ablation studies have been carried out and the

developed formalism for specifying CPS resiliency in terms of sets of
$(\mathit{rec},\mathit{dur})$ real-valued pairs, where $\mathit{rec}$
represents the system's capability to rapidly recover from a property violation
(recoverability), and $\mathit{dur}$ is reflective of its ability to avoid
violations post-recovery (durability). We define the resilient STL control
problem as one of multi-objective optimization, where the recoverability and
durability of the desired STL specification are maximized. When neither
objective is prioritized over the other, the solution to the problem is a set
of Pareto-optimal system trajectories. We present a precise solution method to
the resilient STL control problem using a mixed-integer linear programming
encoding and an a posteriori $\epsilon$-constraint approach for efficiently
retrieving the complete set of optimally resilient solutions. In ResilienC, at
each time-step, the optimal control action selected from the set of
Pareto-optimal solutions by a Decision Maker strategy realizes a form of Model
Predictive Control. We demonstrate the practical utility of the ResilienC
framework on two significant case studies: autonomous vehicle lane keeping and
deadline-driven, multi-region package delivery.

space-time white noise, also called the stochastic heat equation, on the real

intermittency, but less is known about spatial regions between peaks, which may
loosely refer to as valleys. We present two results about the valleys of the

  Our first theorem provides information about the size of valleys and the
supremum of the solution over a valley. More precisely, we show that the
supremum of the solution over a valley vanishes as $t\to\infty$, and we
establish an upper bound of $\exp\{-\text{const}\cdot t^{1/3}\}$ for the rate
of decay. We demonstrate also that the length of a valley grows at least as
$\exp\{+\text{const}\cdot t^{1/3}\}$ as $t\to\infty$.
  Our second theorem asserts that the length of the valleys are eventually
infinite when the initial data has subgaussian tails.

closed form, as a function of the gain/loss parameter and the fractional
exponent. Examination of the spectrum reveals that an increase of the gain/loss
parameter favors the early appearance of complex eigenvalues, thus is, the
onset of a broken ${\cal PT}$ symmetry. On the other hand, as the fractional
exponent decreases from unity, at a critical value a gap opens up separating
the upper and lower bands, and the spectrum becomes real. Further decrease of
the exponent increases the width of the gap and the system remains in the
$\cal{PT}$-symmetric phase down to a vanishing value of the fractional
exponent. Examination of the density of states and the participation ratio
reinforce these observations and lead one to conclude that, unlike the
standard, non-fractional case where the binary lattice is always in the broken
$\cal{PT}$ phase, for the fractional case it is possible to have a symmetric
$\cal{P}{\cal T}$ phase in the presence of a finite gain/loss parameter and a

optimal statistical ML models as surrogates for exact quantum-number projection
calculations for norm and Hamiltonian kernels. The model space of the original
GCM is reduced to a subspace relevant for nuclear low energy spectra and the
NME of ground state to ground state $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay based on the
orthogonality condition (OC) and the energy-transition-orthogonality procedure
(ENTROP), respectively. For simplicity, the polynomial ridge regression (RR)
algorithm is used to learn the norm and Hamiltonian kernels of axially deformed

for 76Ge and 76Se by comparing results obtained using the optimal RR models to
direct GCM calculations. The low-lying energy spectra of $^{76}$Ge and

  alignments",,,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cosmology, we routinely choose between models to describe our data, and
can incur biases due to insufficient models or lose constraining power with
overly complex models. In this paper we propose an empirical approach to model
selection that explicitly balances parameter bias against model complexity. Our
method uses synthetic data to calibrate the relation between bias and the
$\chi^2$ difference between models. This allows us to interpret $\chi^2$ values
obtained from real data (even if catalogues are blinded) and choose a model
accordingly. We apply our method to the problem of intrinsic alignments -- one
of the most significant weak lensing systematics, and a major contributor to
the error budget in modern lensing surveys. Specifically, we consider the
example of the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3), and compare the commonly
used nonlinear alignment (NLA) and tidal alignment & tidal torque (TATT)
models. The models are calibrated against bias in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane.
Once noise is accounted for, we find that it is possible to set a threshold
$\Delta \chi^2$ that guarantees an analysis using NLA is unbiased at some
specified level $N\sigma$ and confidence level. By contrast, we find that
theoretically defined thresholds (based on, e.g., $p-$values for $\chi^2$) tend
to be overly optimistic, and do not reliably rule out cosmological biases up to
$\sim 1-2\sigma$. Considering the real DES Y3 cosmic shear results, based on
the reported difference in $\chi^2$ from NLA and TATT analyses, we find a
roughly $30\%$ chance that were NLA to be the fiducial model, the results would
be biased (in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane) by more than $0.3\sigma$. More
broadly, the method we propose here is simple and general, and requires a
relatively low level of resources. We foresee applications to future analyses
as a model selection tool in many contexts.

divides the vertices into two parts: embedding set and prediction set. And
after integer mapping, the embedding ability of the embedding set is calculated
by the prediction set. It is then passed to the data hider for embedding
additional data. Finally, the additional data and the original models can be

  Pre-training","EMNLP 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fact verification has attracted a lot of research attention recently, e.g.,
in journalism, marketing, and policymaking, as misinformation and
disinformation online can sway one's opinion and affect one's actions. While
fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be
easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information.
Hence, table-based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and
growing research area. Yet, progress has been limited due to the lack of
datasets that can be used to pre-train language models (LMs) to be aware of
common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To
bridge this gap, in this paper we introduce PASTA, a novel state-of-the-art
framework for table-based fact verification via pre-training with synthesized
sentence-table cloze questions. In particular, we design six types of common
sentence-table cloze tasks, including Filter, Aggregation, Superlative,
Comparative, Ordinal, and Unique, based on which we synthesize a large corpus
consisting of 1.2 million sentence-table pairs from WikiTables. PASTA uses a
recent pre-trained LM, DeBERTaV3, and further pretrains it on our corpus. Our
experimental results show that PASTA achieves new state-of-the-art performance
on two table-based fact verification benchmarks: TabFact and SEM-TAB-FACTS. In
particular, on the complex set of TabFact, which contains multiple operations,
PASTA largely outperforms the previous state of the art by 4.7 points (85.6%
vs. 80.9%), and the gap between PASTA and human performance on the small
TabFact test set is narrowed to just 1.5 points (90.6% vs. 92.1%).

graph structures in relation triples and the weak heterogeneity in attribute
triples. Towards a critical evaluation of embedding-based entity alignment
methods, we construct a new dataset with heterogeneous relations and attributes
based on event-centric KGs. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
existing popular methods, and find that they fail to achieve promising

vertex, some color is used exactly once on its neighborhood. Caro,
Petru\v{s}evski, and \v{S}krekovski proved that every graph $G$ has a proper
conflict-free coloring with at most $5\Delta(G)/2$ colors and conjectured that
$\Delta(G)+1$ colors suffice for every connected graph $G$ with $\Delta(G)\ge

1.6550826\Delta(G)+\sqrt{\Delta(G)}\right\rceil$ colors suffice for every graph
$G$ with $\Delta(G)\ge 10^{9}$; we also prove slightly weaker bounds for all
graphs with $\Delta(G)\ge 750$. These results follow from our more general
framework on proper conflict-free list-coloring of a pair consisting of a graph
$G$ and a ``conflict'' hypergraph ${\mathcal H}$. As another corollary of our
results in this general framework, every graph has a proper
$(\sqrt{30}+o(1))\Delta(G)^{1.5}$-list-coloring such that every bi-chromatic
component is a path on at most three vertices, where the number of colors is
optimal up to a constant factor. Our proof uses a fairly new type of recursive
counting argument called Rosenfeld counting, which is a variant of the
Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma or entropy compression.
  We also prove an asymptotically optimal result for a fractional analogue of
our general framework for proper conflict-free coloring for pairs of a graph
and a conflict hypergraph. A corollary states that every graph $G$ has a
fractional $(1+o(1))\Delta(G)$-coloring such that every fractionally
bi-chromatic component has at most two vertices. In particular, it implies that
the fractional analogue of the conjecture of Caro et al. holds asymptotically

SN~2020jfo shows significant H$\alpha$ absorption in the plateau phase similar

networks might already suffice for certain users, in this work, we propose
CANet, a conceptually simple yet very scalable framework for assigning adaptive
network architecture in an input-dependent manner to reduce unnecessary
computation. The core idea of CANet is to route the input user behaviors with a
light-weighted router module. Specifically, we first construct the routing
space with various submodels parameterized in terms of multiple model
dimensions such as the number of layers, hidden size and embedding size. To
avoid extra storage overhead of the routing space, we employ a weight-slicing
schema to maintain all the submodels in exactly one network. Furthermore, we
leverage several solutions to solve the discrete optimization issues caused by
the router module. Thanks to them, CANet could adaptively adjust its network
architecture for each input in an end-to-end manner, in which the user
preference can be effectively captured. To evaluate our work, we conduct
extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that
CANet reduces computation by 55 ~ 65% while preserving the accuracy of the
original model. Our codes are available at

which one uses coarse scale observations to reconstruct the high-resolution
solution of the system states. Continuous Data Assimilation (CDA) is a recently
introduced downscaling algorithm that constructs an increasingly accurate
representation of the system states by continuously nudging the large scales
using the coarse observations. We introduce a Discrete Data Assimilation (DDA)
algorithm as a downscaling algorithm based on CDA with discrete-in-time
nudging. We then investigate the performance of the CDA and DDA algorithms for
downscaling noisy observations of the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system in
the chaotic regime. In this computational study, a set of noisy observations
was generated by perturbing a reference solution with Gaussian noise before
downscaling them. The downscaled fields are then assessed using various error-
and ensemble-based skill scores. The CDA solution was shown to converge towards
the reference solution faster than that of DDA but at the cost of a higher
asymptotic error. The numerical results also suggest a quadratic relationship
between the $\ell_2$ error and the noise level for both CDA and DDA. Cubic and
quadratic dependences of the DDA and CDA expected errors on the spatial
resolution of the observations were obtained, respectively.

watching humans perform the task. In this work, we explore how demonstrations
for fabric manipulation tasks can be collected directly by humans, providing an
extremely natural and fast data collection pipeline. Then, using only a handful
of such demonstrations, we show how a pick-and-place policy can be learned and
deployed on a real robot, without any robot data collection at all. We

overlapping angles of the ground target, which can be stitched together to
provide 360{\deg} views. This requires coordinated formation of UAVs that is
adaptive to movements of the ground target. In this paper, we propose a joint
UAV formation and tracking framework to capture 360{\deg} angles of the target.
The proposed framework uses a zero touch approach for automated and adaptive
reconfiguration of multiple UAVs in a coordinated manner without the need for

maximum $k$ such that if $S$ is an $(r-1)$-set contained in a edge of

common dark matter scenarios alternative to standard cold dark matter (CDM):
warm dark matter (WDM), fuzzy dark matter ($\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark

the Hubble Space Telescope out to $z\lesssim 10$ and down to UV magnitudes
$M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -17$. We extrapolate these to fainter yet unexplored
magnitude ranges, and perform abundance matching with the halo mass functions
in a given DM scenario, so obtaining a relationship between the UV magnitude
and the halo mass. We then compute the cosmic SFR density by integrating the
extrapolated UV luminosity functions down to a faint magnitude limit $M_{\rm
UV}^{\rm lim}$, which is determined via the above abundance matching
relationship by two free parameters: the minimum threshold halo mass $M_{\rm
H}^{\rm GF}$ for galaxy formation, and the astroparticle quantity $X$
characterizing each DM scenario (namely, particle mass for WDM and $\psi$DM,
and kinetic temperature at decoupling $T_X$ for SIDM). We perform Bayesian
inference on such parameters via a MCMC technique by comparing the cosmic SFR
density from our approach to the current observational estimates at $z\gtrsim
4$, constraining the WDM particle mass to $m_X\approx
1.2^{+0.3\,(11.3)}_{-0.4\,(-0.5)}$ keV, the $\psi$DM particle mass to

systems, have been rapidly evolving to meet the requirements of next generation
optical networks with respect to high speed, low power consumption, small form

semiconductor laser reliability. Therefore, a great deal of attention has been
devoted to improving it and thereby ensuring reliable transmission. In this
paper, a predictive maintenance framework using machine learning techniques is
proposed for real-time heath monitoring and prognosis of semiconductor laser
and thus enhancing its reliability. The proposed approach is composed of three
stages: i) real-time performance degradation prediction, ii) degradation
detection, and iii) remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. First of all, an
attention based gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is adopted for real-time
prediction of performance degradation. Then, a convolutional autoencoder is
used to detect the degradation or abnormal behavior of a laser, given the
predicted degradation performance values. Once an abnormal state is detected, a
RUL prediction model based on attention-based deep learning is utilized.
Afterwards, the estimated RUL is input for decision making and maintenance
planning. The proposed framework is validated using experimental data derived
from accelerated aging tests conducted for semiconductor tunable lasers. The
proposed approach achieves a very good degradation performance prediction
capability with a small root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.01, a good anomaly
detection accuracy of 94.24% and a better RUL estimation capability compared to
the existing ML-based laser RUL prediction models.

attention. However, existing efforts mainly focus on the OOD issue of
correlation shift. While another type, covariate shift, remains largely
unexplored but is the focus of this work. From a data generation view, causal
features are stable substructures in data, which play key roles in OOD
generalization. While their complementary parts, environments, are unstable
features that often lead to various distribution shifts. Correlation shift
establishes spurious statistical correlations between environments and labels.
In contrast, covariate shift means that there exist unseen environmental
features in test data. Existing strategies of graph invariant learning and data
augmentation suffer from limited environments or unstable causal features,
which greatly limits their generalization ability on covariate shift. In view
of that, we propose a novel graph augmentation strategy: Adversarial Causal
Augmentation (AdvCA), to alleviate the covariate shift. Specifically, it
adversarially augments the data to explore diverse distributions of the
environments. Meanwhile, it keeps the causal features invariant across diverse
environments. It maintains the environmental diversity while ensuring the
invariance of the causal features, thereby effectively alleviating the
covariate shift. Extensive experimental results with in-depth analyses
demonstrate that AdvCA can outperform 14 baselines on synthetic and real-world
datasets with various covariate shifts.

also uses a non-iterative algorithm to change the basis sets to circumvent the
construction of the maximally localized Wannier functions. As a result, HT can
significantly outperform WI in terms of the accuracy of the band structure
calculation. We also find that the eigenvalue transformation can be of

DC traction power systems (TPSs). Near-optimal solutions can be solved with
high computational efficiency by the proposed quasi-OPF. Unlike conventional
OPF utilizing mathematical optimization algorithms, the proposed quasi-OPF
adopts analytical mapping from load information to near-optimal solutions,
hence considerably accelerating the computation. First, we study the mechanism
and physical meaning interpretation of conventional OPF based on a new modeling
method and successfully interpret the mechanism of conventional OPF in flexible
DC TPSs. Then, the analytical mapping from load information to near-optimal
solutions is obtained inspired by the mechanism of conventional OPF, and the
quasi-OPF algorithm is designed based on the mapping. Since the mapping is
based on simple arithmetic, the quasi-OPF algorithm can solve OPF with much
less execution time, achieving subsecond level calculation and a speed-up of 57
times compared to conventional OPF. The effectiveness is verified by
mathematical proofs and a case study with Beijing Metro Line 13. It provides an
insight into the mechanism and physical meaning of OPF, and is a powerful tool
for flexible DC TPSs to analyze the effects of coordinated control, design
real-time control strategies, and solve operational problems in planning.

  Compression",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantizing a floating-point neural network to its fixed-point representation
is crucial for Learned Image Compression (LIC) because it assures the decoding
consistency for interoperability and reduces space-time complexity for
implementation. Existing solutions often have to retrain the network for model
quantization which is time-consuming and impractical. This work suggests the
use of Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) to process pretrained, off-the-shelf
LIC models directly. We theoretically prove that minimizing the mean square
error (MSE) of model parameters (e.g., weight, bias, and activation) in PTQ is
sub-optimal for compression tasks and thus develop a novel Rate-Distortion
(R-D) Optimized PTQ (RDO-PTQ) to best retain the compression performance. Given
a LIC model, RDO-PTQ layer-wisely determines the quantization factors to
transform the original 32-bit floating-point (FP32) parameters to the 8-bit
fixed-point (INT8) precision, for which a tiny calibration image set is
compressed in optimization to minimize R-D loss. Experiments reveal the
outstanding efficiency of the proposed method on different LICs, showing the
closest coding performance to their floating-point counterparts. And, our
method is a lightweight and plug-and-play approach without any need for model
retraining which is attractive to practitioners. Such an RDO-PTQ is a
task-oriented PTQ scheme, which is then extended to quantize popular
super-resolution and image classification models with negligible performance
loss, further evidencing the generalization of our methodology. The materials
will be released at https://njuvision.github.io/RDO-PTQ.

decision-making processes is well documented. Our study's contribution is a
methodology for tackling missing data problems using a combination of synthetic
dataset generation, missing data imputation and deep learning methods to
resolve missing data challenges. Specifically, we conducted a series of
experiments with these objectives; $a)$ generating a realistic synthetic
dataset, $b)$ simulating data missingness, $c)$ recovering the missing data,
and $d)$ analyzing imputation performance. Our methodology used a gaussian
mixture model whose parameters were learned from a cleaned subset of a real
demographic and health dataset to generate the synthetic data. We simulated
various missingness degrees ranging from $10 \%$, $20 \%$, $30 \%$, and $40\%$
under the missing completely at random scheme MCAR. We used an integrated
performance analysis framework involving clustering, classification and direct
imputation analysis. Our results show that models trained on synthetic and
imputed datasets could make predictions with an accuracy of $83 \%$ and $80 \%$
on $a) $ an unseen real dataset and $b)$ an unseen reserved synthetic test
dataset, respectively. Moreover, the models that used the DAE method for
imputed yielded the lowest log loss an indication of good performance, even

demonstrates that using our methodology, one can reverse engineer a solution to
resolve missingness on an unseen dataset with missingness. Moreover, though we
used a health dataset, our methodology can be utilized in other contexts.

protons and intermediate-mass nuclei. The origin of this intermediate-mass

spectroscopy requires realistic modeling of stellar magnetic features, since
features that are attributable to an exoplanet atmosphere could instead stem
from the host star's magnetic activity. Current retrieval algorithms for
analysing transmission spectra rely on intensity contrasts of magnetic features
from 1D radiative-convective models. However, magnetic features, especially
faculae, are not fully captured by such simplified models. Here we investigate
how well such 1D models can reproduce 3D facular contrasts, taking a G2V star
as an example. We employ the well established radiative magnetohydrodynamic
code MURaM to obtain three-dimensional simulations of the magneto-convection
and photosphere harboring a local small-scale-dynamo. Simulations without
additional vertical magnetic fields are taken to describe the quiet solar
regions, while simulations with initially 100 G, 200 G and 300 G vertical
magnetic fields are used to represent different magnetic activity levels.
Subsequently, the spectra emergent from the MURaM cubes are calculated with the
MPS-ATLAS radiative transfer code. We find that the wavelength dependence of
facular contrast from 1D radiative-convective models cannot reproduce facular
contrasts obtained from 3D modeling. This has far reaching consequences for
exoplanet characterization using transmission spectroscopy, where accurate
knowledge of the host star is essential for unbiased inferences of the
planetary atmospheric properties.

computationally expensive task with a solution space that grows
combinatorically. In this work, we consider in particular a quadratic feature
selection problem that can be tackled with the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA), already employed in combinatorial optimization. First we
represent the feature selection problem with the QUBO formulation, which is
then mapped to an Ising spin Hamiltonian. Then we apply QAOA with the goal of
finding the ground state of this Hamiltonian, which corresponds to the optimal
selection of features. In our experiments, we consider seven different
real-world datasets with dimensionality up to 21 and run QAOA on both a quantum
simulator and, for small datasets, the 7-qubit IBM (ibm-perth) quantum
computer. We use the set of selected features to train a classification model
and evaluate its accuracy. Our analysis shows that it is possible to tackle the
feature selection problem with QAOA and that currently available quantum
devices can be used effectively. Future studies could test a wider range of
classification models as well as improve the effectiveness of QAOA by exploring
better performing optimizers for its classical step.

High-order interaction of order semantic information. Apart from the

have shown that the probability of violating the conjecture not only for the
prime numbers, but also for any subset of natural numbers whose distribution is
similar to the prime numbers is negligible. This result makes it possible to
generalize the conjecture to any subset of natural numbers whose distribution
is similar to the prime numbers. Additionally, we selected several new subsets
whose distribution amongst the natural numbers are similar to the prime numbers
by randomly addition of +1 and -1 to the prime numbers and checked the Goldbach
conjecture for every even integer less than $2 \times 10^8$ by computer. As it
was expected, the Goldbach conjecture holds true for these new reconstructed
sets, as well. Consequently, the conjecture can be generalized to any subset of
natural numbers whose distribution is similar to the prime numbers. That is
""being prime"" is not necessary for the conjecture to hold for the instances.
This fact brings to mind the idea that perhaps what makes the Conjecture to
hold for the instances is ""probability"", not number theory facts.

conditional generative adversarial neural network-based augmentation method
which is able to synthesize mel spectrograms from a learned data distribution

2.84% of Macro F1-Score for a classifier trained on the augmented data set, an
enhancement of $1.14\%$ in relation to previous work. By analyzing the

can lead to further enhancement of heat transfer are still highly desirable.
Here, by employing a three-dimensional, multiphase computational approach, we
present an effective out-of-plane biphilic surface topography, that reveals an
unexplored capillarity-driven departure mechanism of condensate droplets. This
texture consists of biphilic diverging micro-cavities wherein a matrix of small
hydrophilic spots is placed at their bottom, that is, amongst the

by Friends inside a laboratory and superobservers outside a laboratory, who
have access to an entangled state of the measurement apparatus. The
contradictions lead to no-go theorems for observer-independent facts, thus
challenging concepts of objectivity. Here, we examine the paradoxes from the
perspective of establishing consistency with macroscopic realism. We present
versions of the Brukner-Wigner-friend and Frauchiger-Renner paradoxes in which
the spin-$1/2$ system measured by the Friends corresponds to two
macroscopically distinct states. The local unitary operations $U_{\theta}$ that
determine the measurement setting $\theta$ are carried out using nonlinear
interactions, thereby ensuring measurements need only distinguish between the
macroscopically distinct states. The macroscopic paradoxes are perplexing,
seemingly suggesting there is no objectivity in a macroscopic limit. However,
we demonstrate consistency with a contextual weak form of macroscopic realism
(wMR): The premise wMR asserts that the system can be considered to have a
definite spin outcome $\lambda_{\theta}$, at the time after the system has
undergone the unitary rotation $U_{\theta}$ to prepare it in a suitable pointer
basis. We further show that the paradoxical outcomes imply failure of
deterministic macroscopic local realism, and arise when there are unitary
interactions $U_{\theta}$ occurring due to a change of measurement setting at
both sites, with respect to the state prepared by each Friend. In models which
validate wMR, there is a breakdown of a subset of the assumptions that
constitute the Bell-Locality premise. A similar interpretation involving a weak
contextual form of realism exists for the original paradoxes.

abnormal cases in which they are similar. Once a malicious query is detected,
the account of the user who made it can be blocked. Thus, the attacker must
create many accounts to perpetrate the attack. To decrease this number, the
attacker could create the adversarial program against a surrogate classifier
and then fine-tune it by making few queries to the target model. In this
scenario, the effectiveness of the stateful defense is reduced, but we show
that it is still effective.

consistent with a measurement of mass indicating a rocky body and the
prediction by a hydrodynamic model that any H-dominated atmosphere would be
unstable and already have been lost. Differential spectra obtained during the
transit of TOI-2076b contain a He I-like feature, but this closely resembles
the stellar line and extends beyond the transit interval. Until additional
transits are observed, we suspect this to be the result of variation in the
stellar He I line produced by rotation of active regions and/or flaring on the
young, active host star. Non-detection of escape could mean that TOI-2076b is
more massive than expected, the star is less EUV-luminous, the models
overestimate escape, or the planet has a H/He-poor atmosphere that is primarily
molecules such as H$_2$O. Photochemical models of planetary winds predict a
semi-major axis at which triplet He I observations are most sensitive to mass
loss: TOI-2076b orbits near this optimum. Future surveys could use a distance
criterion to increase the yield of detections.

novel state-object compositions that are absent during the training stage.
Previous methods of learning compositional embedding have shown effectiveness
in closed-world CZSL. However, in Open-World CZSL (OW-CZSL), their performance
tends to degrade significantly due to the large cardinality of possible
compositions. Some recent works separately predict simple primitives (i.e.,
states and objects) to reduce cardinality. However, they consider simple
primitives as independent probability distributions, ignoring the heavy
dependence between states, objects, and compositions. In this paper, we model
the dependence of compositions via feasibility and contextuality.
Feasibility-dependence refers to the unequal feasibility relations between
simple primitives, e.g., \textit{hairy} is more feasible with \textit{cat} than
with \textit{building} in the real world. Contextuality-dependence represents
the contextual variance in images, e.g., \textit{cat} shows diverse appearances
under the state of \textit{dry} and \textit{wet}. We design Semantic Attention
(SA) and generative Knowledge Disentanglement (KD) to learn the dependence of
feasibility and contextuality, respectively. SA captures semantics in
compositions to alleviate impossible predictions, driven by the visual
similarity between simple primitives. KD disentangles images into unbiased
feature representations, easing contextual bias in predictions. Moreover, we
complement the current compositional probability model with feasibility and
contextuality in a compatible format. Finally, we conduct comprehensive
experiments to analyze and validate the superior or competitive performance of

Ariel transmission spectra of representative targets of the Ariel mission

of a hot Jupiter and a hot Neptune, as well as the secondary atmosphere of a
super-Earth that also exhibits a cloud presence. We extracted information on
the various properties of the atmospheres for the cases of unknown mass or mass
with different uncertainties. We also tested how the signal-to-noise ratio
impacts atmospheric retrieval for different wavelength ranges. We accurately
retrieved the primordial atmospheric composition independently from mass
uncertainties for clear atmospheres, while we found that the uncertainties
increased for high altitude clouds. We highlight the importance of the
signal-to-noise ratio in the Rayleigh scattering region of the spectrum. For
the secondary atmosphere cases, a mass uncertainty no larger than 50% is
sufficient to retrieve the atmospheric parameters, even in the presence of
clouds. Our analysis suggests that even in the worst-case scenario, a 50% mass
precision level is enough for producing reliable retrievals, while an
atmospheric retrieval without any knowledge of a planetary mass could lead to
biases in cloudy primary atmospheres as well as in secondary atmospheres.

Comparing the OU-driven Burgers turbulence with that driven by temporal white

VISinger has several problems: text-to-phase problem, the end-to-end model
learns the meaningless mapping of text-to-phase; glitches problem, the harmonic
components corresponding to the periodic signal of the voiced segment occurs a
sudden change with audible artefacts; low sampling rate, the sampling rate of
24KHz does not meet the application needs of high-fidelity generation with the
full-band rate (44.1KHz or higher). In this paper, we propose VISinger 2 to
address these issues by integrating the digital signal processing (DSP) methods
with VISinger. Specifically, inspired by recent advances in differentiable
digital signal processing (DDSP), we incorporate a DSP synthesizer into the
decoder to solve the above issues. The DSP synthesizer consists of a harmonic
synthesizer and a noise synthesizer to generate periodic and aperiodic signals,
respectively, from the latent representation z in VISinger. It supervises the
posterior encoder to extract the latent representation without phase
information and avoid the prior encoder modelling text-to-phase mapping. To
avoid glitch artefacts, the HiFi-GAN is modified to accept the waveforms
generated by the DSP synthesizer as a condition to produce the singing voice.
Moreover, with the improved waveform decoder, VISinger 2 manages to generate
44.1kHz singing audio with richer expression and better quality. Experiments on
OpenCpop corpus show that VISinger 2 outperforms VISinger, CpopSing and
RefineSinger in both subjective and objective metrics.

resulting HAQJSK kernels are defined by measuring the Quantum Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (QJSD) between their transitive aligned graph structures. We show
that the proposed HAQJSK kernels not only reflect richer intrinsic global graph

neglecting structural correspondence information arising in most existing
R-convolution kernels. Furthermore, unlike the previous Quantum Jensen-Shannon

To address the issue of having all the data in one location, federated
learning, which maintains the ability to learn over decentralized data sets,
combines privacy and technology. Until the model converges, the server combines
the updated weights obtained from each dataset over a number of rounds. The
majority of the literature suggested client selection techniques to accelerate
convergence and boost accuracy. However, none of the existing proposals have
focused on the flexibility to deploy and select clients as needed, wherever and
whenever that may be. Due to the extremely dynamic surroundings, some devices
are actually not available to serve as clients in FL, which affects the
availability of data for learning and the applicability of the existing
solution for client selection. In this paper, we address the aforementioned
limitations by introducing an On-Demand-FL, a client deployment approach for
FL, offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We
make use of the containerization technology such as Docker to build efficient
environments using IoT and mobile devices serving as volunteers. Furthermore,
Kubernetes is used for orchestration. The Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to
solve the multi-objective optimization problem due to its evolutionary
strategy. The performed experiments using the Mobile Data Challenge (MDC)

approach and the efficiency of the on-the-fly deployment of clients whenever

equivalent to an image taken in a dark environment with only a flash on. This
flash-only image is visually reflection-free and thus can provide robust cues
to infer the reflection in the ambient image. Since the flash-only image
usually has artifacts, we further propose a dedicated model that not only
utilizes the reflection-free cue but also avoids introducing artifacts, which
helps accurately estimate reflection and transmission. Our experiments on
real-world images with various types of reflection demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model with reflection-free flash-only cues: our model
outperforms state-of-the-art reflection removal approaches by more than 5.23dB

This region recalibration strategy enables the network to focus more on

U-net with deep supervision constraints to adaptively capture the robust
representation of breast tumors. Extensive experiments with twelve

on the relative proportion of such edges in a network, and on whether the

adopted in the integrated multi-media system. Specifically, the messages of
devices using heterogeneous propagation media, are firstly transmitted to the
medium-matched AP, with the aid of the RIS-based dual-hop transmission. After
the operation of intermediate frequency conversion, the access point (AP)
uploads the received signals to the cloud for further demodulating and decoding
process. Based on time division multiple access (TDMA), the cloud is able to
distinguish the downlink data transmitted to different devices and transforms
them into the input of the RIS controller via the dedicated control channel.
Thereby, the RIS can passively reflect the incident carrier back into the
original receiver with the exchanged information during the preallocated slots,
following the idea of an index modulation-based transmitter. Moreover, the
iterative optimization algorithm is utilized for optimizing the RIS phase,
transmit rate and time allocation jointly in the delay-constrained cross-media
communication model. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
RIS-based scheme can improve the end-to-end throughput than that of the

maximally entangled state shared between the sender and the receiver. In this
work, we consider a situation where the sender and the receiver are in a
superposed situation of sharing a maximally entangled state and not sharing
anything, controlled by a quantum switch. We consider two distinct protocols:
in the first case, the sender and the receiver do nothing when there is no
shared entanglement and in the second case, they use classical communication in
absence of entanglement. In each of the protocols, we follow two different
paths. In the first path, after the protocol is completed, we simply throw away
the switch. In the second path, after accomplishing the protocol, we operate a
Hadamard gate on the switch, measure the switch's state, and consider the
outcome corresponding to a particular state of the switch. We compare the two
paths with the maximum fidelity achievable through random guess or utilizing
classical resources only. In particular, we provide conditions to achieve
nonclassical fidelity in teleportation by applying quantum switch. We comment
on whether the difference between the two paths can be expressed in terms of

Boosting (XGB) classifier might not be reliable for binary classification under
the conditions this work presents. Second, we demonstrate that at least one of

accuracy and reliability with better uncertainty calibration based on the
assumption that the RS determines the difference between MC and MA metrics, and
this difference should be zero to increase reliability. For example, Method 3
presents the best RS of 0.65 even when compared to the XGB classifier, which
achieves RS of 7.22.

divisible resource -- modeled as a line segment $[0,1]$ and typically called as
a \emph{cake} -- among $n$ agents. This work considers an interesting variant
of the problem where agents are embedded on a graph. The graphical constraint
entails that each agent evaluates her allocated share only against her
neighbors' share. Given a graph, the goal is to efficiently find a
\emph{locally envy-free} allocation where every agent values her share of the
cake to be at least as much as that of any of her neighbors' share.
  The most significant contribution of this work is a bounded protocol that
finds a locally envy-free allocation among $n$ agents on a tree graph using
$n^{O(n)}$ queries under the standard Robertson-Webb (RW) query model. The
query complexity of our proposed protocol, though exponential, significantly
improves the currently best known hyper-exponential query complexity bound of
Aziz and Mackenzie [AM16] for complete graphs. In particular, we also show that
if the underlying tree graph has a depth of at most two, one can find a locally
envy-free allocation with $O(n^4 \log n)$ RW queries. This is the first and the
only known locally envy-free cake cutting protocol with polynomial query
complexity for a non-trivial graph structure.
  Interestingly, our discrete protocols are simple and easy to understand, as
opposed to highly involved protocol of [AM16]. This simplicity can be
attributed to their recursive nature and the use of a single agent as a
designated \emph{cutter}. We believe that these results will help us improve
our algorithmic understanding of the arguably challenging problem of envy-free
cake-cutting by uncovering the bottlenecks in its query complexity and its
relation to the underlying graph structures.

interrupted by blocks, repetitions or prolongations of syllables, words and
phrases. The majority of existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) interfaces
perform poorly on utterances with stutter, mainly due to lack of matched
training data. Synthesis of speech with stutter thus presents an opportunity to
improve ASR for this type of speech. We describe Stutter-TTS, an end-to-end
neural text-to-speech model capable of synthesizing diverse types of stuttering
utterances. We develop a simple, yet effective prosody-control strategy whereby
additional tokens are introduced into source text during training to represent
specific stuttering characteristics. By choosing the position of the stutter
tokens, Stutter-TTS allows word-level control of where stuttering occurs in the
synthesized utterance. We are able to synthesize stutter events with high
accuracy (F1-scores between 0.63 and 0.84, depending on stutter type). By
fine-tuning an ASR model on synthetic stuttered speech we are able to reduce
word error by 5.7% relative on stuttered utterances, with only minor (<0.2%
relative) degradation for fluent utterances.

explainable-by-design neural models providing logic explanations for their
predictions. However, these models have only been applied to vision and tabular
data, and they mostly favour the generation of global explanations, while local
ones tend to be noisy and verbose. For these reasons, we propose LENp,
improving local explanations by perturbing input words, and we test it on text
classification. Our results show that (i) LENp provides better local
explanations than LIME in terms of sensitivity and faithfulness, and (ii) logic
explanations are more useful and user-friendly than feature scoring provided by
LIME as attested by a human survey.

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) requires eliciting strong brain responses in a
short span of time, as much as the accurate classification of such evoked
potentials remains challenging and imposes hard constraints for signal
processing and machine learning techniques. Recent advances in stimulus
presentation and deep learning showcased a promising direction in significantly
improving the efficacy of those systems, in this study we propose the
combination of colored inverted face stimulation with classification using
convolutional neural networks in the hard settings of dry electrodes and fast
flashing single-trial ERP-based BCI. The high online accuracy achieved, with
two subjects passing the 90 percent correct symbol detection bar and a transfer
rate above 60 bits per minute, demonstrates the approach potential in improving
the practicality of ERP based BCIs.

physicists to understand the processes in materials and their properties. This
paper presents a general statistical methodology for the analysis of
crystallographic orientations of grains in a 3D Laguerre tessellation dataset
which represents the microstructure of a polycrystalline material. We introduce
complex stochastic models which may substitute expensive laboratory
experiments: conditional on the Laguerre tessellation, we suggest interaction
models for the distribution of cubic crystal lattice orientations, where the
interaction is between pairs of orientations for neighbouring grains in the
tessellation. We discuss parameter estimation and model comparison methods
based on maximum pseudolikelihood as well as graphical procedures for model
checking using simulations. Our methodology is applied for analysing a dataset
representing a nickel-titanium shape memory alloy.
