masses has recently been proposed. Proposals using qubits to witness this
entanglement can afford to bring two masses close enough so that the complete

and micron-sized masses separated by 10-100 microns (with or without
electromagnetic screening) suffice to provide a 0.01-1 Hz rate of growth of

so far has been to employ spins embedded in the masses, whose correlations are
used to witness the entanglement developed between masses during
interferometry. This comes with the dual challenge of incorporating spin
coherence-preserving methodologies into the protocol, as well as a demanding
precision of control fields for the accurate completion of spin-aided
(Stern-Gerlach) interferometry. Here we show that if superpositions of distinct
spatially localized states of each mass can be created, whatever the means,
simple position correlation measurements alone can yield a spatial qubit

of digital images. Encrypting large-sized colour images in their original
dimension generally results in low encryption/decryption speed along with
exerting a burden on the limited bandwidth of the transmission channel. To
address the aforementioned issues, a new encryption scheme for colour images
employing convolutional autoencoder, DNA and chaos is presented in this paper.
The proposed scheme has two main modules, the dimensionality conversion module
using the proposed convolutional autoencoder, and the encryption/decryption
module using DNA and chaos. The dimension of the input colour image is first
reduced from N $\times$ M $\times$ 3 to P $\times$ Q gray-scale image using the
encoder. Encryption and decryption are then performed in the reduced dimension
space. The decrypted gray-scale image is upsampled to obtain the original
colour image having dimension N $\times$ M $\times$ 3. The training and
validation accuracy of the proposed autoencoder is 97% and 95%, respectively.
Once the autoencoder is trained, it can be used to reduce and subsequently
increase the dimension of any arbitrary input colour image. The efficacy of the
designed autoencoder has been demonstrated by the successful reconstruction of
the compressed image into the original colour image with negligible perceptual
distortion. The second major contribution presented in this paper is an image
encryption scheme using DNA along with multiple chaotic sequences and
substitution boxes. The security of the proposed image encryption algorithm has
been gauged using several evaluation parameters, such as histogram of the
cipher image, entropy, NPCR, UACI, key sensitivity, contrast, etc. encryption.

re-ID setting where the training samples are labeled, our novel scenario
combines their key challenges: the training samples are unlabeled, and
collected form various domains which do no align with the test domain. In other
words, we aim to learn a representation in an unsupervised manner and directly
use the learned representation for re-ID in novel domains. To fulfill this
goal, we make two main contributions: First, we propose Cycle Association
(CycAs), a scalable self-supervised learning method for re-ID with low training
complexity; and second, we construct a large-scale unlabeled re-ID dataset
named LMP-video, tailored for the proposed method. Specifically, CycAs learns
re-ID features by enforcing cycle consistency of instance association between
temporally successive video frame pairs, and the training cost is merely linear
to the data size, making large-scale training possible. On the other hand, the
LMP-video dataset is extremely large, containing 50 million unlabeled person
images cropped from over 10K Youtube videos, therefore is sufficient to serve
as fertile soil for self-supervised learning. Trained on LMP-video, we show
that CycAs learns good generalization towards novel domains. The achieved
results sometimes even outperform supervised domain generalizable models.
Remarkably, CycAs achieves 82.2% Rank-1 on Market-1501 and 49.0% Rank-1 on

in a strictly convex and analytic set having the origin and that is dilated by
a factor $t$. The aim is to generalize the result of a previous article. We
first show that the study of the error, when it is normalized by $\sqrt{t}$,
when this parameter tends to infinity and when the considered lattice is
random, is reduced to the study of a Siegel transform $\mathcal{S}(f_{t})(L)$
which depends on $t$. Then, we come back to the study of the asymptotic
behaviour of a Siegel transform with random weights, $\mathcal{S}(F)(\theta,L)$
where $\theta$ is a second random parameter. Then, we show that this last
quantity converges almost surely and we study the existence of moments of its
law. Finally, we show that this result is still valid if we translate, after
dilation, the strictly convex set of a fixed vector $\alpha \in
\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

Hence, it is imperative to design efficient channel tracking schemes to avoid
the complex channel estimation procedure. In this paper, we develop a novel
channel tracking scheme with two advantages over conventional schemes. First,
our tracking scheme is based on the cascaded angles at the RIS instead of the
accurate angle values, which is more practical. Second, it can be employed
under a more general setting where the noise can be non-Gaussian. Simulation
results show the high tracking accuracy of our proposed scheme, and validate
the superiority to the existing EKF-based tracking scheme.

nanophotonics, impacting diverse fields from higher harmonic generation and
energy conversion to surface-enhanced spectroscopy. Plasmonic perfect absorbers
(PAs), where resonant antennas couple to their mirror images in adjacent metal
films, have been instrumental for obtaining different coupling regimes by
tuning the antenna-film distance. However, for on-chip uses, the ideal PA gap
size can only match one wavelength, and wide range multispectral approaches
remain challenging. Here, we introduce a new paradigm for plasmonic PAs by
combining mirror-coupled resonances with the unique loss engineering
capabilities of plasmonic bound states in the continuum (BICs). Our BIC-driven
PA platform leverages the asymmetry of the constituent meta-atoms as an
additional degree of freedom for reaching the critical coupling (CC) condition,
delivering resonances with unity absorbance and high quality factors
approaching 100 in the mid-infrared. Such a platform holds flexible tuning
knobs including asymmetry parameter, dielectric gap, and geometrical scaling
factor to precisely control the coupling condition, resonance frequency, and
selective enhancement of magnetic and electric fields while maintaining CC. We
demonstrate a pixelated PA metasurface with optimal absorption over a broad
range of mid-infrared frequencies (950 ~ 2000 1/cm) using only a single spacer
layer thickness and apply it for multispectral surface-enhanced molecular
spectroscopy in tailored coupling regimes. Our concept greatly expands the
capabilities and flexibility of traditional gap-tuned PAs, opening new
perspectives for miniaturized sensing platforms towards on-chip and in-situ
detection.

the pairwise distances between the points are determined by their spatial

distance $d(\mathbf x,\mathbf y)=\delta$ between two points is fixed by the
choice of $\mathbf x$ and $\mathbf y$ and $d$. We study the related problem of
fixing the value $\delta$, and the points $\mathbf x,\mathbf y$, and ask if
there is a topological metric $d$ that computes the desired distance $\delta$.
We demonstrate this problem to be solvable by constructing a metric to
simultaneously give desired pairwise distances between up to $O(\sqrt\ell)$
many points in $\mathbb{R}^\ell$. We then introduce the notion of an
$\varepsilon$-semimetric $\tilde{d}$ to formulate our main result: for all
$\varepsilon>0$, for all $m\geq 1$, for any choice of $m$ points $\mathbf
y_1,\ldots,\mathbf y_m\in\mathbb{R}^\ell$, and all chosen sets of values

results by using them to attack unsupervised learning algorithms, specifically
$k$-Means and density-based (DBSCAN) clustering algorithms. These have manifold
applications in artificial intelligence, and letting them run with externally
provided distance measures constructed in the way as shown here, can make
clustering algorithms produce results that are pre-determined and hence

generally be trustworthy, unless there is a standardized and fixed prescription

of $Q$ factor can be achieved in a finite PhC by combining avoiding crossing of
two symmetry protected (SP) quasi-BICs in parametric space and merging BICs in

the proposed mechanism results in the transition of asymptotic behavior of the
$Q$ factor over the numbers of resonators from $N^2$ to exclusive $N^3$ for
SP-BICs, which is of vital importance for realizing quasi-BICs in a compact
PhC. Microwave experiments are performed to validate the theoretical results.
Our results provide a paradigm shift for manipulating the physical properties

human bodies. However, training a part-based model is a challenging task for
two reasons. Firstly, individual body part appearance is not as discriminative
as global appearance (two distinct IDs might have the same local appearance),
this means standard ReID training objectives using identity labels are not

  Conclusion: The use of learning-based feature descriptors in LLR is
promising, as it can help achieve an accurate initial rigid alignment, which,
in turn, serves as an initialization for subsequent non-rigid registration. We

an extra control parameter, the detuning of the two-photon drive with respect

symmetries in the system, leading to multiple degeneracies in the spectrum of
the effective confinement Hamiltonian. Overall, these degeneracies lead to a
stronger suppression of bit-flip errors. We also study the combination of such
Hamiltonian confinement with colored dissipation to suppress leakage outside of

perform fast and high-fidelity gates while preserving a strong suppression of

advantage of them without violating users' privacy one of the fundamental
problems of computer science for the 21st century. This question has been
investigated thoroughly under the framework of differential privacy. However,
most of the literature has not focused on settings where the amount of data is
so large that we are not able to compute the exact answer in the non-private
setting (such as in the streaming setting, sublinear-time setting, etc.). This
can often make the use of differential privacy unfeasible in practice. In this
paper, we show a general approach for making Monte-Carlo randomized
approximation algorithms differentially private. We only need to assume the
error $R$ of the approximation algorithm is sufficiently concentrated around
$0$ (e.g.\ $E[|R|]$ is bounded) and that the function being approximated has a
small global sensitivity $\Delta$.
  First, we show that if the error is subexponential, then the Laplace
mechanism with error magnitude proportional to the sum of $\Delta$ and the
\emph{subexponential diameter} of the error of the algorithm makes the
algorithm differentially private. This is true even if the worst-case global
sensitivity of the algorithm is large or even infinite. We then introduce a new
additive noise mechanism, which we call the zero-symmetric Pareto mechanism. We
show that using this mechanism, we can make an algorithm differentially private
even if we only assume a bound on the first absolute moment of the error
$E[|R|]$.
  Finally, we use our results to give the first differentially private
algorithms for various problems. This includes results for frequency moments,
estimating the average degree of a graph in sublinear time, or estimating the
size of the maximum matching. Our results raise many new questions; we state
multiple open problems.

agent refines the path design in the new domain based on the subsequent

path policy, previously trained at sub-6 GHz path, is the solution to a
connectivity-aware path problem that we formulate as a constrained Markov

design of these mechanisms is formulated as a privacy-utility (tradeoff)
problem where system utility is characterized by anomaly detection performance,

networking requirements by exploiting the workload's temporal structure.
However, operating networks adaptively is algorithmically challenging, as
meeting networks' stringent dependability requirements relies on maintaining
basic consistency and performance properties, such as loop freedom and
congestion minimization, even during the update process. This paper leverages
an augmentation-speed tradeoff to significantly speed up consistent network
updates. We show that allowing for a small and short (hence practically
tolerable, e.g., using buffering) oversubscription of links allows us to solve
many network update instances much faster, as well as to reduce computational
complexities (i.e., the running times of the algorithms). We first explore this
tradeoff formally, revealing the computational complexity of scheduling
updates. We then present and analyze algorithms that maintain logical and
performance properties during the update. Using an extensive simulation study,
we find that the tradeoff is even more favorable in practice than our
analytical bounds suggest. In particular, we find that by allowing just 10%
augmentation, update times reduce by more than 32% on average, across a

In this work it is shown how arbitrary, fluctuation-driven electronic order may
be introduced into density functional theory using the quantum
order-by-disorder framework. This is a method of calculating the free energy
correction due to collective spin and charge fluctuations about a state that
hosts static order, in a self-consistent manner. In practical terms, the
quantum order-by-disorder method is applied to the Kohn-Sham auxiliary system
of density functional theory to give an order-dependent correction to the
exchange-correlation functional. Calculation of fluctuation propagators within

of order are considered as examples -- fluctuation-driven superconductivity and
spin nematic order -- and implementation schemes are presented in each case.

at high friction Reynolds numbers in the range of $4500 \le Re_\tau \le 15000$.
The efficacy of the approach, using streamwise travelling waves of spanwise
wall oscillations, is studied for two actuation regimes: (i) inner-scaled
actuation (ISA), as investigated in Part 1 of this study, which targets the
relatively high-frequency structures of the near-wall cycle, and (ii)
outer-scaled actuation (OSA), which was recently presented by Marusic et al.
(Nat. Commun., vol. 12, 2021) for high-$Re_\tau$ flows, targeting the
lower-frequency, outer-scale motions. Multiple experimental techniques were
used, including a floating-element balance to directly measure the
skin-friction drag force, hot-wire anemometry to acquire long-time fluctuating
velocity and wall-shear stress, and stereoscopic-PIV (particle image
velocimetry) to measure the turbulence statistics of all three velocity
components across the boundary layer. Under the ISA pathway, drag reduction of
up to 25% was achieved, but mostly with net power saving losses due to the
high-input power cost associated with the high-frequency actuation. The
low-frequency OSA pathway, however, with its lower input power requirements,
was found to consistently result in positive net power savings of 5 - 10%, for
moderate drag reductions of 5 - 15%. The results suggest that OSA is an
attractive pathway for energy-efficient drag reduction in high Reynolds number
applications. Both ISA and OSA strategies are found to produce complex
inter-scale interactions, leading to attenuation of the turbulent fluctuations
across the boundary layer for a broad range of length and time scales.

areas of science ranging from brainwave entrainment and neuromorphic computing

materials play a pivotal role combining very fast switching with permanent
retention of information. However, it has been shown that, at very short time

resulting in incoherent spin-wave excitations that ultimately destroy magnetic
ordering. Here, contrary to all expectations, we show that such chaos gives
rise to a periodic pattern of reversed magnetic domains, with a feature size
far smaller than the spatial extent of the excitation. We explain this pattern
as a result of phase-synchronisation of magnon-polaron waves, driven by strong
coupling of magnetic and elastic modes. Our results reveal not only the

information (SI) collected from contact tracing (CT) into
nonadaptive/single-stage group testing algorithms. We generate different types
of possible CT SI data by incorporating different possible characteristics of
the spread of the disease. These data are fed into a group testing framework
based on generalized approximate message passing (GAMP). Numerical results show
that our GAMP-based algorithms provide improved accuracy. Compared to a loopy
belief propagation algorithm, our proposed framework can increase the success
probability by 0.25 for a group testing problem of n = 500 individuals with m =
100 pooled samples.

during the CVR period if the substation voltage is not lowered. The proposed
algorithm consists of two key steps: selection of similar days and iterative
bidirectional-GB training. In the first step, pre- and post-event temperature
profiles of the targeted CVR day are used to select similar days from
historical non-CVR days. In the second step, the pre-event and post-event
similar days are used to train two GBMs iteratively: a forward-GBM and a
backward-GBM. After each iteration, the two generated CVR baselines are
reconciled and only the first and the last points on the reconciled baseline
are kept. The iteration repeats until all CVR baseline points are generated. We
tested two gradient boosting methods (i.e., GBM and LighGBM) with two data
resolutions (i.e., 15- and 30-minute). The results demonstrate that both the
accuracy and performance of the algorithm are satisfactory.

charged-current muon neutrino interactions on argon with one muon, two protons,
and no pions in the final state. Such interactions leave the target nucleus in
a two-particle two-hole state; these states are of great interest, but
currently there is limited information about their production in
neutrino-nucleus interactions. Detailed investigations of the production of
two-particle two-hole states are vital to support upcoming experiments
exploring the nature of the neutrino, and the development of the liquid-argon
time-projection-chamber has made possible the isolation of such final states.
The opening angle between the two protons, the angle between the total proton
momentum and the muon, and the total transverse momentum of the final state
system are sensitive to the underlying physics processes as embodied in a
variety of models. Realistic initial-state momentum distributions are shown to
be important in reproducing the data.

Incorporate an ambient solar wind instead of using a static potential magnetic
field extrapolation as the initial state. (2) In addition to imposing the
emergence of a twisted flux rope, also impose at the lower boundary a random
electric field that represents the effect of turbulent convection, which drives
field-line braiding and produces resistive and viscous heating in the corona.
With the inclusion of this heating, which depends on the magnetic field
topology, we are able to model the synthetic soft X-ray images that would be
observed by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) of the Hinode satellite, produced by the
simulated coronal magnetic field. We find that the simulated pre-eruption
magnetic field with the build up of a twisted magnetic flux rope, produces
synthetic soft X-ray emission that shows qualitatively similar morphology as
that observed by the Hinode/XRT for both the ambient coronal loops of the
active region and the central inverse-S shaped ""sigmoid"" that sharpens just
before the onset of the eruption. The synthetic post-flare loop brightening
also shows similar morphology as that seen in the Hinode/XRT image during the
impulsive phase of the eruption. It is found that the kinematics of the
erupting flux rope is significantly affected by the open magnetic fields and
fast solar wind streams adjacent to the active region.

physics despite weak spin-orbit coupling. However, other theoretical and

interactions in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO), which calls for a further study
to clarify the origin of the discrepancies. Here we derive the analytical
expressions of the spin model using strong-coupling perturbation theory. With
tight binding parameters obtained by {\it ab-initio} calculations for idealized
honeycomb BCAO, we find that the largest intraorbital $t_{2g}-t_{2g}$ exchange
path, which was assumed to be small in the earlier theory proposal, leads to a
ferromagnetic (FM) Heisenberg interaction. This becomes the dominant
interaction, as other $t_{2g}-e_g$ and $e_g-e_g$ contributions almost cancel
each other. Exactly the same assumed-to-be-small channel also generates an
antiferromagnetic Kitaev interaction, which then cancels a FM Kitaev
interaction from $t_{2g}-e_g$ paths, resulting in a small Kitaev interaction.
Under the trigonal distortion, the preeminent isotropic Heisenberg becomes an
anisotropic XXZ model as expected, which is the case for BCAO. However, in
Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ the intraorbital $t_{2g}-t_{2g}$ hopping is smaller and
comparable to the $t_{2g}-e_g$ hopping, leading to a delicate competition
between enhanced Kitaev and reduced Heisenberg interactions.

time, providing a unique opportunity to map the many pathways of galaxy
assembly to an incredibly high resolution. However, the huge amount of data
also poses an immediate computational challenge: current tools for inferring
parameters from the light of galaxies take $\gtrsim 10$ hours per fit. This is
prohibitively expensive. Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a promising
solution. However, it requires simulated data with identical characteristics to
the observed data, whereas real astronomical surveys are often highly
heterogeneous, with missing observations and variable uncertainties determined
by sky and telescope conditions. Here we present a Monte Carlo technique for
treating out-of-distribution measurement errors and missing data using standard
SBI tools. We show that out-of-distribution measurement errors can be
approximated by using standard SBI evaluations, and that missing data can be
marginalized over using SBI evaluations over nearby data realizations in the
training set. While these techniques slow the inference process from $\sim 1$
sec to $\sim 1.5$ min per object, this is still significantly faster than
standard approaches while also dramatically expanding the applicability of SBI.
This expanded regime has broad implications for future applications to
astronomical surveys.

collapse of porosity can occur via a wide range of mechanisms dependent on pore
morphology, shockwave pressure, and material properties. The mechanisms that
occur under weaker shocks tend to be more efficient at localizing thermal
energy, but do not result in high, absolute temperatures or spatially large
localizations compared to mechanisms found under strong shock conditions.
However, the energetic material TATB undergoes a wide range of collapse
mechanisms that are not typical of similar materials, leaving the collapse
mechanisms and the resultant energy localization from collapse, i.e., hotspots,
relatively uncharacterized. Therefore, we present pore collapse simulations of
cylindrical pores in TATB for a wide range of pore sizes and shock strengths
that trigger viscoplastic collapses that occur almost entirely perpendicular to
the shock direction for weak shocks and hydrodynamic-like collapses for strong
shocks that do not break the strong hydrogen bonds of the TATB basal planes.
The resulting hotspot temperature fields from these mechanisms follow trends
that differ considerably from other energetic materials; hence we compare them
under normalized temperature values to assess the relative efficiency of each
mechanism to localize energy. The local intra-molecular strain energy of the
hotspots is also assessed to better understand the physical mechanisms behind

Gamma-rays that are produced close to SMBH therefore have to propagate in the

gamma-ray emission can be strongly absorbed in the extended jet radiation,
producing a second generation of electron-positron pairs that loses energy

AIs can surpass human performance by a large margin. Given that the state space
of Go is extremely large and a human player can play the game from any legal
state, we ask whether adversarial states exist for Go AIs that may lead them to
play surprisingly wrong actions. In this paper, we first extend the concept of
adversarial examples to the game of Go: we generate perturbed states that are
``semantically'' equivalent to the original state by adding meaningless moves
to the game, and an adversarial state is a perturbed state leading to an
undoubtedly inferior action that is obvious even for Go beginners. However,
searching the adversarial state is challenging due to the large, discrete, and
non-differentiable search space. To tackle this challenge, we develop the first
adversarial attack on Go AIs that can efficiently search for adversarial states
by strategically reducing the search space. This method can also be extended to
other board games such as NoGo. Experimentally, we show that the actions taken
by both Policy-Value neural network (PV-NN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
can be misled by adding one or two meaningless stones; for example, on 58\% of
the AlphaGo Zero self-play games, our method can make the widely used KataGo
agent with 50 simulations of MCTS plays a losing action by adding two
meaningless stones. We additionally evaluated the adversarial examples found by
our algorithm with amateur human Go players and 90\% of examples indeed lead
the Go agent to play an obviously inferior action. Our code is available at

diseases including COVID-19. Clinical assessment of dyspnea is mainly performed
by subjective self-report, which has limited accuracy and is challenging for
continuous monitoring. The objective of this research study is to determine if
dyspnea progression in COVID patients can be assessed using a non-invasive
wearable sensor and if the findings are comparable to a learning model of
physiologically induced dyspnea on healthy subjects. Methods: Non-invasive
wearable respiratory sensors were employed to retrieve continuous respiratory
characteristics with user comfort and convenience. Overnight (~16h) respiratory
waveforms were collected on 12 COVID-19 patients, and a benchmark on 13 healthy
subjects with exertion-induced dyspnea were also performed for blind
comparison. The learning model was built from the respiratory features with
self report on 32 healthy subjects under exertion and airway blockage. Results:
High similarity between dyspnea on COVID patients and physiologically induced
dyspnea on healthy subjects was established. COVID patients have consistently
high objective dyspnea scores in comparison with normal breathing of healthy
subjects. We also exhibited continuous dyspnea scoring capability for 12-16
hours on patients. Conclusion: This paper validates the viability to use our
objective dyspnea scoring for clinical dyspnea assessment on COVID patients.
Significance: The proposed system can help the identification of dyspneic
exacerbation in conditions such as COVID, leading to early intervention and
possibly improving their outcome. This approach can be potentially applied to
other pulmonary disorders such as asthma, emphysema, and pneumonia.

entanglements in their native structures. To gain more insight into the
significance of protein knotting, researchers have been investigating protein
knot formation using both experimental and theoretical methods. Motivated by
the hypothesized folding pathway of $\alpha$-haloacid dehalogenase (DehI)
protein, Flapan, He, and Wong proposed a theory of how protein knots form,
which includes existing folding pathways described by Taylor and B\""olinger et
al. as special cases. In their topological descriptions, two loops in an
unknotted open protein chain containing at most two twists each come close
together, and one end of the protein eventually passes through the two loops.
In this paper, we build on Flapan, He, and Wong's theory where we pay attention
to the crossing signs of the threading process and assume that the unknotted
protein chain may arrange itself into a more complicated configuration before
threading occurs. We then apply tangle calculus, originally developed by Ernst
and Sumners to analyze the action of specific proteins on DNA, to give all
possible knots or knotoids that may be discovered in the future according to
our model and give recipes for engineering specific knots in proteins from
simpler pieces. We show why twists knots are the most likely knots to occur in
proteins. We use chirality to show that the most likely knots to occur in
proteins via Taylor's twisted hairpin model are the knots $+3_1$, $4_1$, and
$-5_2$.

repeat, or remain irreversible with chaotic motion. R-IR transitions were first
systematically studied for periodically sheared dilute colloids, and appear in
a wide variety of both soft and hard matter systems, including amorphous
solids, crystals, vortices in type-II superconductors, and magnetic textures.
In some cases, the reversible transition is an absorbing phase transition with
a critical divergence in the organization time scale. R-IR systems can store
multiple memories and exhibit return point memory. We give an overview of R-IR
transitions including recent advances in the field, and discuss how the general
framework of R-IR transitions could be applied to a much broader class of
periodically driven nonequilibrium systems, including soft and hard condensed
matter systems, astrophysics, biological systems, and social systems. Some
likely candidate systems are commensurate-incommensurate states, systems
exhibiting hysteresis or avalanches, and nonequilibrium pattern forming states.
Periodic driving could be applied to hard condensed matter systems to see if
R-IR transitions occur in metal-insulator transitions, semiconductors, electron
glasses, electron nematics, cold atom systems, or Bose-Einstein condensates.
R-IR transitions could also be examined in dynamical systems where
synchronization or phase locking occurs. We discuss the use of complex periodic
driving such as changing drive directions or multiple frequencies as a method
to retain complex multiple memories. Finally, we describe features of classical
and quantum time crystals that could suggest the occurrence of R-IR transitions
in these systems.

half filling, we identify the Luther-Emery liquid (LEL) phase, which can be
distinguished as the pairing-dominant and charge density-dominant regime by
comparing the Luttinger parameter $K_{\rho}$. With the growing NNN couplings,
pairing correlations are enhanced and correspondingly $K_{\rho}$ increases,
driving the system from the density-dominant to the pairing-dominant regime. In

that in the LEL phase of the two-leg ladder, the NNN couplings seem to play the

distribution of relative position angles peaks at ~30deg and exhibits a broad
dispersion of ~50deg. These results indicate that magnetic fields have
dynamical influence in regulating the launching and/or propagation directions
of outflows. However, the significant dispersion around perfect alignment
orientation implies that there are large measurement uncertainties and/or a
high degree of intrinsic variation caused by other physical processes, such as
turbulence or strong stellar dynamical interactions. Outflow to magnetic field
alignment is expected to lead to a correlation in the directions of nearby
outflow pairs, depending on the degree of order of the field. Analyzing this
effect we find limited correlation, except on relatively small scales < 0.5 pc.
Furthermore, we train a convolutional neural network to infer the inclination
angle of outflows with respect to the line of sight and apply it to our outflow

topological subsystem codes to systems of composite-dimensional qudits and
establishes that the classification is at least as rich as that of Abelian
anyon theories. We exemplify the construction with topological subsystem codes
defined on four-dimensional qudits based on the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{(1)}$ anyon
theory with degenerate braiding relations and the chiral semion theory--both of
which cannot be captured by topological stabilizer codes. The construction
proceeds by ""gauging out"" certain anyon types of a topological stabilizer code.
This amounts to defining a gauge group generated by the stabilizer group of the
topological stabilizer code and a set of anyonic string operators for the anyon
types that are gauged out. The resulting topological subsystem code is
characterized by an anyon theory containing a proper subset of the anyons of
the topological stabilizer code. We thereby show that every Abelian anyon
theory is a subtheory of a stack of toric codes and a certain family of twisted
quantum doubles that generalize the double semion anyon theory. We further
prove a number of general statements about the logical operators of translation
invariant topological subsystem codes and define their associated anyon

understanding the growth of supermassive black holes across cosmic time. A
significant challenge toward this goal is the whereabouts of heavily obscured
AGN that remain uncertain. This paper sets new constraints on the demographics
of this population by developing a methodology that combines X-ray spectral
information with priors derived from multiwavelength observations. We select
X-ray AGN in the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey and fit their $2.2-500\mu m$
spectral energy distributions with galaxy and AGN templates to determine the
mid-infrared ($6\mu m$) luminosity of the AGN component. Empirical correlations
between X-ray and $6\mu m$ luminosities are then adopted to infer the intrinsic
accretion luminosity at X-rays for individual AGN. This is used as prior
information in our Bayesian X-ray spectral analysis to estimate physical
properties, such as line-of-sight obscuration. Our approach breaks the
degeneracies between accretion luminosity and obscuration that affect X-ray
spectral analysis, particularly for the most heavily obscured (Compton-Thick)
AGN with low photon counts X-ray spectra. The X-ray spectral results are then
combined with the selection function of the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey to
derive the AGN space density and a Compton-Thick fraction of
$21.0^{+16.1}_{-9.9}\%$ at redshifts $z<0.5$. At higher redshift, our analysis
suggests upper limits to the Compton-Thick AGN fraction of $\le 40\%$. These
estimates are at the low end of the range of values determined in the
literature and underline the importance of multiwavelength approaches for
tackling the challenge of heavily obscured AGN demographics.

Namely, an arbitrary number of identical bulk Dirac nodes will always remain

protecting symmetry is preserved. In this work, we find that this
single-particle classification for $C_n$-symmetric DSMs will break down to
$\mathbb{Z}_{n/\text{gcd}(2,n)}$ in the presence of symmetry-preserving

which reduces a 3D Dirac fermions to 1D building blocks, i.e., vortex-line
modes, while respecting all the key symmetries. Using bosonization technique,
we find that there exists a minimal number $N=n/\text{gcd}(2,n)$ such that the
collection of vortex-line modes in $N$ copies of DSMs can be symmetrically
eliminated via four-fermion interactions. While this gapping mechanism does not
have any free-fermion counterpart, it yields an intuitive ``electron-trion

further checking the anomaly-free condition, we independently arrive at the
same classification results. Our theory paves the way for understanding

training progressively more complex variational autoencoders (VAEs) and graph

in VS performance, these methods suffer from reduced performance when scaling
to large virtual compound datasets. The performance of these methods has shown
only incremental improvements in the past few years. To address this problem,
we developed a novel method using multiparameter persistence (MP) homology that
produces topological fingerprints of the compounds as multidimensional vectors.
Our primary contribution is framing the VS process as a new topology-based

informed by the periodic properties of its atoms and extracting their
persistent homology features at multiple resolution levels. We show that the
margin loss fine-tuning of pretrained Triplet networks attains highly

establish theoretical guarantees for the stability properties of our proposed

parameterized by a new $3\times 3$ coupling matrix $\lambda$. Consistent with
the field content of the model, also the Standard Model's approximate flavour

Universe content behaves like radiation, the mass fraction of these black
holes, that is tiny at formation, becomes significant later. If sufficiently
small, these black holes will evaporate while the Universe is still radiation
dominated. We revisit this process and point out that gravitons produced during
the evaporation behave as ``dark radiation"". If the initial black holes are
uniformly distributed so will be the gravitons and in this case they will be
free of Silk damping and avoid current limits on ""dark radiation"" scenarios.
Seeds for such black holes can arise during the last phases of inflation. We
show here that with suitable parameters, this background graviton field can
resolve the Hubble tension. We present current observational constraints on
this scenario and suggest upcoming observational tests to prove or refute it.
Finally, we also elaborate on the graviton background produced by particle
annihilation during the Planck era or shortly after inflation.

two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulations, although recent work suggests that
3D effects may significantly alter the structure of the inner cavity created by
the binary. In this study, we present the results of 3D hydrodynamical
simulations of circumbinary discs that orbit around analogues of the Kepler-16

cooling on the thermal disc structure. We find that compared to their 2D
counterparts, the structures of the cavities in 3D circumbinary disc models
appear to reach a quasi-stationary state more rapidly, and in a subset of our
runs the evidence for this is unambiguous. Furthermore, the sizes and
eccentricities of the inner cavity are smaller in 3D compared to 2D. We
attribute this difference to enhanced spiral wave dissipation in disc regions
above the midplane, where the cooling time is of the order of the dynamical
timescale, resulting in smaller inner cavity sizes in 3D disc models. Our
results suggest that migrating planets should park closer to the central binary
in 3D models of circumbinary discs, and point to the importance of including
the 3D structure when simulating circumbinary discs and planets.

requirements is to mask the complexity of specifying such requirements in a
timed temporal logic for verification. For this purpose, they provide frontends
to express and translate pattern-based natural language requirements to
formulae in a suitable logic. However, the widely used real-time model checking
tool UPPAAL only supports a restricted subset of those formulae that focus only
on basic and non-nested reachability, safety, and liveness properties. This
restriction renders many specification patterns inapplicable. As a workaround,
timed observer automata need to be constructed manually to express
sophisticated requirements envisioned by these patterns. Objective: In this
work, we fill these gaps by providing a comprehensive specification pattern
catalog for UPPAAL. The catalog supports qualitative and real-time requirements
and covers all corresponding patterns of existing catalogs. Method: The catalog
we propose is integrated with UPPAAL. It supports the specification of
qualitative and real-time requirements using patterns and provides an automated
generator that translates these requirements to observer automata and TCTL
formulae. The resulting artifacts are used for verifying systems in UPPAAL.
Thus, our catalog enables an automated end-to-end verification process for
UPPAAL based on property specification patterns and observer automata. Results:
We evaluate our catalog on three UPPAAL system models reported in the
literature and mostly applied in an industrial setting. As a result, not only
the reproducibility of the related UPPAAL models was possible, but also the
validation of an automated, seamless, and accurate pattern- and observer-based
verification process. Conclusion: The proposed property specification pattern
catalog for UPPAAL enables practitioners to specify qualitative and real-time
requirements...

densities between those of the slow and rapid neutron-capture processes. It can
be triggered by the ingestion of protons in a convective helium-burning region.
One possible astrophysical site is low-mass low-metallicity asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars. We study here the possibility that actinides (particularly
Th and U) may be significantly synthesized through i-process nucleosynthesis in
AGB stars. We computed a 1 $M_{\odot}$ model at [Fe/H] $= -2.5$ with the
stellar evolution code STAREVOL. We used a nuclear network of 1160 species from
H to Cf coupled to the transport processes. During the proton ingestion event,
the neutron density goes up to $\sim 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. While most of the
nuclear flow cycles in the neutron-rich Pb-Bi-Po region, a non-negligible
fraction leaks towards heavier elements and eventually synthesizes actinides.
The surface enrichment in Th and U is subject to nuclear and astrophysical
model uncertainties that could be lowered in the future, in particular by a
detailed analysis of the nuclear inputs that affect the neutron capture rates
of neutron-rich isotopes between Pb and Pa. One stellar candidate that may
confirm the production of actinides by the i-process is the carbon-enhanced
metal-poor r/s star J0949-1617, which shows Th lines in its spectrum. Its
surface abundance is shown to be reasonably well reproduced by our AGB model.
Combined with cosmochronometry, this finding opens the way to dating the
i-process event and thus obtaining a lower limit for the age of CEMP-r/s stars.
Such a dating is expected to be accurate only if surface abundances of Th and U
can be extracted simultaneously. This work shows that actinides can be
synthesized in AGB stars through the i-process. As a consequence, the r-process
may not be the sole mechanism for the production of U and Th.

stochastic instead of classical calculus, we propose a new mathematical
formulation that resolves the particle MSD at all time scales for any
two-dimensional shear flow described by a polynomial velocity profile. The
theory is validated for the cases of Couette and Plane-Poiseuille flows while
neglecting the effect of boundaries on particle diffusion. We show that for
times much longer than the relaxation time scale, $\tau_p$, the time dependency
of the MSD is $t^{n+2}$, where $n$ is the polynomial order of the transverse
velocity profile. The coupling between Brownian motion in the transverse
direction and the flow velocity gradients significantly alters the particle
diffusion in the streamwise direction. Finally, we generalize the theory to
resolve any polynomial shear flow at all time scales, including the order of
$\tau_p$, which is not resolved in current theories. Thus, higher temporal and
spatial resolution for diffusion processes in shear flows may be realized,
suggesting a more accurate analytical approach for the diffusion of Brownian

processes within social and spatial networks of communities. Existing knowledge
regarding the diffusion of recovery in community socio-spatial networks,
however, is rather limited. To bridge this gap, in this study, we created a
network diffusion model to characterize the unfolding of population activity
recovery in spatial networks of communities. Using data related to population
activity recovery durations calculated from location-based data in the context
of 2017 Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area, we parameterized the
threshold-based network diffusion model and evaluated the extent of homogeneity
in spatial effects. Then we implemented the network diffusion model along with
the genetic algorithm to simulate and identify recovery multipliers. The
results show that the spatial effects of recovery are rather heterogeneous
across spatial areas; some spatial areas demonstrate a greater spatial effect
(spatial interdependence) in their recovery compared with others. Also, the
results show that low-income areas demonstrate a greater spatial effect in
their recovery. The greater spatial effects in recovery of low-income areas
imply more reliance on resources and facilities of neighboring areas and also
explain the existence of slow recovery hotspots in areas where socially
vulnerable populations reside. Also, the results show that low-income and
minority areas are community recovery multipliers; the faster the recovery of
these recovery multipliers; the faster the recovery of the entire community.
Hence, prioritizing these areas for recovery resource allocation could expedite
the recovery of the overall community and promote recovery equality and equity.

learning. In this paper, we focus on using power iteration to decompose an
overcomplete random tensor. Past work studying the properties of tensor power
iteration either requires a non-trivial data-independent initialization, or is
restricted to the undercomplete regime. Moreover, several papers implicitly
suggest that logarithmically many iterations (in terms of the input dimension)
are sufficient for the power method to recover one of the tensor components. In
this paper, we analyze the dynamics of tensor power iteration from random
initialization in the overcomplete regime. Surprisingly, we show that
polynomially many steps are necessary for convergence of tensor power iteration
to any of the true component, which refutes the previous conjecture. On the
other hand, our numerical experiments suggest that tensor power iteration
successfully recovers tensor components for a broad range of parameters,
despite that it takes at least polynomially many steps to converge. To further
complement our empirical evidence, we prove that a popular objective function
for tensor decomposition is strictly increasing along the power iteration path.
Our proof is based on the Gaussian conditioning technique, which has been
applied to analyze the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. The major
ingredient of our argument is a conditioning lemma that allows us to generalize
AMP-type analysis to non-proportional limit and polynomially many iterations of
the power method.

models to downstream tasks by training a small amount of newly added
parameters. In multi-task settings, PEFT adapters typically train on each task
independently, inhibiting transfer across tasks, or on the concatenation of all
tasks, which can lead to negative interference. To address this, Polytropon
(Ponti et al.) jointly learns an inventory of PEFT adapters and a routing
function to share variable-size sets of adapters across tasks. Subsequently,
adapters can be re-combined and fine-tuned on novel tasks even with limited
data. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the ability to control which
adapters are active for each task leads to sample-efficient generalization.
Thus, we propose less expressive variants where we perform weighted averaging
of the adapters before few-shot adaptation (Poly-mu) instead of learning a
routing function. Moreover, we introduce more expressive variants where
finer-grained task-adapter allocation is learned through a multi-head routing
function (Poly-S). We test these variants on three separate benchmarks for
multi-task learning. We find that Poly-S achieves gains on all three (up to 5.3
points on average) over strong baselines, while incurring a negligible
additional cost in parameter count. In particular, we find that instruction

it have been left unclear so far. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental

0.02 to 77 GHz$\times h$. We find that the formation rate approximately scales
as $E_b^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is in the vicinity of 1. The formation rate
typically varies only within a factor of two for different rotational angular

With this work, we aim to provide the first S abundance in Ruprecht 106 and to
investigate the S content of Trumpler 5 with a larger sample of stars. The open
cluster Trumpler 20 is considered as a reference object. Methods. We performed
a standard abundance analysis based on 1D model atmospheres in local
thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) and on high-resolution and
high-signal-to-noise-ratio UVES-slit and UVES/FLAMES spectra. We also applied
corrections for nonLTE. The metallicities of the targets were obtained by
studying equivalent widths. Sulfur abundances were derived from multiplets 1,
6, and 8 by spectrosynthesis. Results. We find that the metallicities of
Ruprecht 106 and Trumpler 5 are [Fe/H]= -1.37+/-0.11 and [Fe/H]= -0.49+/-0.14,
respectively. Ruprecht 106 is less S-rich than the other Galactic clusters at
similar metallicity. The low S content of Ruprecht 106, [S/Fe]NLTE=
-0.52+/-0.13, is consistent with its shortage of $\alpha$-elements. This
supports an extra-galactic origin of this cluster. We obtained a new and more
robust S content value of Trumpler 5 of about [S/Fe]NLTE= 0.05+/-0.20.
According to our results, Trumpler 5 follows the trend of the Galactic disk in
the [S/Fe]LTE versus [Fe/H] diagram. Our results for Trumpler 20, of namely
[Fe/H]= 0.06+/-0.15 and [S/Fe]NLTE= -0.28+/-0.21, are in agreement with those

forming an oscillating cloud, spinning down the black hole, and radiating
gravitational waves in the process. However, maximizing the chance of observing
such signals or, in their absence, placing the strongest constraints on the

of fundamental importance in all scientific domains, and several new machine
learning methods for addressing the causal discovery problem have been proposed
recently. However, existing machine learning methods for causal discovery
typically require that the data used for inference is pooled and available in a
centralized location. In many domains of high practical importance, such as in
healthcare, data is only available at local data-generating entities (e.g.
hospitals in the healthcare context), and cannot be shared across entities due
to, among others, privacy and regulatory reasons. In this work, we address the
problem of inferring causal structure - in the form of a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) - from a distributed data set that contains both observational and
interventional data in a privacy-preserving manner by exchanging updates
instead of samples. To this end, we introduce a new federated framework,
FED-CD, that enables the discovery of global causal structures both when the
set of intervened covariates is the same across decentralized entities, and
when the set of intervened covariates are potentially disjoint. We perform a
comprehensive experimental evaluation on synthetic data that demonstrates that
FED-CD enables effective aggregation of decentralized data for causal discovery
without direct sample sharing, even when the contributing distributed data sets
cover disjoint sets of interventions. Effective methods for causal discovery in
distributed data sets could significantly advance scientific discovery and
knowledge sharing in important settings, for instance, healthcare, in which
sharing of data across local sites is difficult or prohibited.

Recently, thanks to their engineerable electromagnetic response, metamaterials
have been exploited for achieving novel refractive scattering processes, going
beyond the classical prism effects. In this Manuscript, we report on a novel
rainbow-like scattering process taking place at the interface of a
boundary-induced temporal metamaterial realized by instantaneously opening the
boundary conditions of a parallel plate waveguide. Changing abruptly the
conductivity of one of the two metallic plates, we demonstrate that an
equivalent temporal interface between two different media is realized, and the
monochromatic wave propagating into the waveguide gets scattered into a
polychromatic rainbow in free-space. We derive the relationships between the
waveguide mode and the raising rainbow in terms of scattered amplitude and
frequencies as a function of the elevation angle with respect to the waveguide
axis. We apply the underlying physics to control the temporal rainbow by
imposing a principal direction of scattering by design. Full-wave numerical
simulations are performed for computing the rainbow temporal scattering and
verifying the design guidelines for achieving controlled temporal rainbow
scattering.

component on the Hb profile, and in 14/22 cases an Hb outflowing component
associated to [O iii] is detected. The majority of [O iii] emission line
profiles show blueshifted velocities larger than 250 km s^-1. [O iii] and C iv
blueshifts show very high amplitudes and a high degree of correlation. Line
width and shift are correlated for both [O iii] and C iv, suggesting that
emission from outflowing gas is providing a substantial broadening to both
lines. Otherwise, the links between C iv centroid velocity at half intensity
(c(1/2)), Eddington ratio (L/LEdd), and bolometric luminosity are found to be
in agreement with previous studies of high-luminosity quasars. Our analysis
suggests that the behaviour of quasars of very high luminosity all along the
main sequence is strongly affected by powerful outflows involving a broad range
of spatial scales. The main sequence correlations remain valid at high redshift
and high luminosity even if a systematic increase in line width is observed.
Scaling laws based on UV Al iii and Hb emission lines are equally reliable

networking platforms. This platform allows individuals to freely express
opinions and interact with others regardless of geographic barriers. However,
with the good that online platforms offer, also comes the bad. Twitter and
other social networking platforms have created new spaces for incivility. With
the growing interest on the consequences of uncivil behavior online,
understanding how a toxic comment impacts online interactions is imperative. We
analyze a random sample of more than 85,300 Twitter conversations to examine
differences between toxic and non-toxic conversations and the relationship
between toxicity and user engagement. We find that toxic conversations, those
with at least one toxic tweet, are longer but have fewer individual users
contributing to the dialogue compared to the non-toxic conversations. However,
within toxic conversations, toxicity is positively associated with more
individual Twitter users participating in conversations. This suggests that
overall, more visible conversations are more likely to include toxic replies.
  Additionally, we examine the sequencing of toxic tweets and its impact on
conversations. Toxic tweets often occur as the main tweet or as the first
reply, and lead to greater overall conversation toxicity. We also find a
relationship between the toxicity of the first reply to a toxic tweet and the
toxicity of the conversation, such that whether the first reply is toxic or
non-toxic sets the stage for the overall toxicity of the conversation,
following the idea that hate can beget hate.

\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, either determine whether $K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ is
empty, or find an integer point in the convex body scaled by $2$ from its
center of gravity $c$. Approximate integer programming can be solved in time
$2^{O(n)}$ while the fastest known methods for exact integer programming run in
time $2^{O(n)} \cdot n^n$. So far, there are no efficient methods for integer
programming known that are based on approximate integer programming. Our main
contribution are two such methods, each yielding novel complexity results.
  First, we show that an integer point $x^* \in (K \cap \mathbb{Z}^n)$ can be
found in time $2^{O(n)}$, provided that the remainders of each component $x_i^*
\mod{\ell}$ for some arbitrarily fixed $\ell \geq 5(n+1)$ of $x^*$ are given.
The algorithm is based on a cutting-plane technique, iteratively halving the
volume of the feasible set. The cutting planes are determined via approximate
integer programming. Enumeration of the possible remainders gives a
$2^{O(n)}n^n$ algorithm for general integer programming. This matches the
current best bound of an algorithm by Dadush (2012) that is considerably more
involved. Our algorithm also relies on a new asymmetric approximate
Carath\'eodory theorem that might be of interest on its own.
  Our second method concerns integer programming problems in equation-standard
form $Ax = b, 0 \leq x \leq u, \, x \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ . Such a problem can be
reduced to the solution of $\prod_i O(\log u_i +1)$ approximate integer
programming problems. This implies, for example that knapsack or subset-sum
problems with polynomial variable range $0 \leq x_i \leq p(n)$ can be solved in
time $(\log n)^{O(n)}$. For these problems, the best running time so far was
$n^n \cdot 2^{O(n)}$.

possible types of change and types of behaviour of data when there is no

both of these features, and it can be difficult for a practitioner to develop
an appropriate detection method for their application of interest. We show how
to automatically generate new detection methods based on training a neural
network. Our approach is motivated by many existing tests for the presence of a
change-point being able to be represented by a simple neural network, and thus
a neural network trained with sufficient data should have performance at least
as good as these methods. We present theory that quantifies the error rate for
such an approach, and how it depends on the amount of training data. Empirical
results show that, even with limited training data, its performance is
competitive with the standard CUSUM test for detecting a change in mean when
the noise is independent and Gaussian, and can substantially outperform it in
the presence of auto-correlated or heavy-tailed noise. Our method also shows
strong results in detecting and localising changes in activity based on

of Killing horizons that the vacuum Einstein's equations can be separated into
a divergent and a finite part, leading to a well-defined minimal set of
Einstein's equations one needs to solve. We extend the result to Einstein
gravity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field. We also discuss the case
of Einstein gravity coupled to a Maxwell field, in which case the separability
holds if the Maxwell potential has non-vanishing components only in the

overlooked aspect of the overlap bias in NLI models: the reverse word-overlap
bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that current NLI models are highly
biased towards the non-entailment label on instances with low overlap, and the
existing debiasing methods, which are reportedly successful on existing
challenge datasets, are generally ineffective in addressing this category of
bias. We investigate the reasons for the emergence of the overlap bias and the
role of minority examples in its mitigation. For the former, we find that the
word-overlap bias does not stem from pre-training, and for the latter, we
observe that in contrast to the accepted assumption, eliminating minority
examples does not affect the generalizability of debiasing methods with respect
to the overlap bias.

of accretion discs around neutron stars: the corona can cool and collapse, the
inner regions can be bled away due to enhanced accretion, and the additional
heating will lead to changes in the disc height. In this paper, we investigate
whether radiation from bursts can cause the disc to distort through a warping
instability. Working in the limit of isotropic viscosity and linear growth, we
find that bursts are more likely to drive disc warps when they have larger
luminosities and longer durations. Therefore, warps will be most probable
during intermediate duration bursts (IMDBs) and superbursts with evidence for
photospheric radius expansion. Further, the development of warps depends on the
disc viscosity with larger values of $\alpha$ increasing the likelihood of warp
growth. We perform time-dependent evolution calculations of the development of
warps during Type I bursts and IMDBs. Depending on the initial warp prior to
the burst, we find the burst produces warps at $r$ <~ 50 $r_g$ that rapidly
grow and decay on second-long timescales, or ones that grow more slowly and
cover a large fraction of the disc. The pulsations of warp at small radii
appear to have the properties needed to explain the achromatic fluctuations
that have been observed during the tails of some IMDBs. The large scale, slowly
growing warps could account for the large reflection strengths and absorbing
column densities inferred late in the 4U 1820-30 and 4U 1636-53 superbursts.

the Lyapunov exponents, this is not, in general, true simultaneously for all
the values of the parameter. The structure of the exceptional sets is
interesting in its own right, and is also of importance in the spectral
analysis of the operators. We present new results along with amplifications and
generalisations of several older ones, and also list a few open questions.
  Here are two sample results. On the negative side, for any square-summable
sequence $p_n$ there is a residual set of energies in the spectrum on which the
middle singular value (the $W$-th out of $2W$) grows no faster than $p_n^{-1}$.
On the positive side, for a large class of cocycles including the i.i.d. ones,
the set of energies at which the growth of the singular values is not as given
by the Lyapunov exponents has zero Hausdorff measure with respect to any gauge
function $\rho(t)$ such that $\rho(t)/t$ is integrable at zero.
  The employed arguments from the theory of subharmonic functions also yield a
generalisation of the Thouless formula, possibly of independent interest: for

Telescope imaging reveals a quadruply lensed system in a cusp configuration,
with a maximum image separation of ~1.8\arcsec. We find that compared to the
central image of the cusp, the neighboring brightest image is anomalous by a
factor of ~ 7 - 10, which is the largest flux anomaly measured to date in a
lensed QSO. Incorporating high-resolution Jansky Very Large Array radio imaging
and sub-mm imaging with the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array, we conclude
that a low-mass perturber is the most likely explanation for the anomaly. The
optical through near-infrared spectrum reveals that the QSO is moderately
reddened with E(B - V) = 0.7 - 0.9. We see an upturn in the ultraviolet
spectrum due to ~ 1% of the intrinsic emission being leaked back into the line
of sight, which suggests that the reddening is intrinsic and not due to the
lens. The QSO may have an Eddington ratio as high as L/L_Edd ~ 0.2. Consistent
with previous red QSO samples, this source exhibits outflows in its spectrum as
well as morphological properties suggestive of it being in a merger-driven
transitional phase. We find a host-galaxy stellar mass of log M_*/M_Sun = 11.4,
which is higher than the local M_BH vs. M_* relation, but consistent with other
high redshift QSOs. When de-magnified, this QSO is at the knee of the
luminosity function, allowing for the detailed study of a more typical

an optimization algorithm that uses gradient descent over a neural network to
solve the optimization problem. We describe initial results from offline

  The main motive of this work is to solve for Single and Multi target Domain
Adaptation (SMTDA) for the source-free paradigm, which enforces a constraint
where the labeled source data is not available during target adaptation due to
various privacy-related restrictions on data sharing. The source-free approach
leverages target pseudo labels, which can be noisy, to improve the target
adaptation. We introduce consistency between label preserving augmentations and
utilize pseudo label refinement methods to reduce noisy pseudo labels. Further,
we propose novel MixUp Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for better generalization
on multiple target domains using various source-free STDA models.
  We also show that the Vision Transformer (VT) backbone gives better feature
representation with improved domain transferability and class discriminability.

justifies several existing heuristics for task decomposition and makes
predictions that can be distinguished from two alternative normative accounts.
We report a behavioral study of task decomposition ($N=806$) that uses 30
randomly sampled graphs, a larger and more diverse set than that of any
previous behavioral study on this topic. We find that human responses are more
consistent with our framework for task decomposition than alternative normative

that is justified by our approach. Taken together, our results provide new
theoretical insight into the computational principles underlying the

mass without any dynamical assumptions, a model bias can arise when the cluster
density profile departs from the assumed model profile. In a merging system,
the bias is expected to become most severe because the constituent halos
undergo significant structural changes. In this study, we investigate WL mass
bias in binary cluster mergers using a suite of idealized hydrodynamical
simulations. Realistic WL shear catalogs are generated by matching the source
galaxy properties, such as intrinsic shape dispersion, measurement noise,
source densities, etc., to those from Subaru and {\it Hubble Space Telescope}
observations. We find that, with the typical mass-concentration ($M$-$c$)
relation and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, the halo mass bias depends
on the time since the first pericenter passage and increases with the mass of
the companion cluster. The time evolution of the mass bias is similar to that
of the concentration, indicating that, to first order, the mass bias is
modulated by the concentration change. For a collision between two
$\sim10^{15}~M_{\odot}$ clusters, the maximum bias amounts to $\sim60\%$. This
suggests that previous WL studies may have significantly overestimated the mass
of the clusters in some of the most massive mergers. Finally, we apply our
results to three merger cases: Abell 2034, MACS J1752.0+4440, and ZwCl
1856.8+6616, and report their mass biases at the observed epoch, as well as

are given an $n \times n$ metric on a set $V$ of vertices along with a set $T
\subseteq V$ of $k$ terminals, and the goal is to find a tree of minimum cost
that contains all terminals in $T$. The query complexity for the related
minimum spanning tree (MST) problem is well-understood: for any fixed
$\varepsilon > 0$, one can estimate the MST cost to within a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-factor using only $\tilde{O}(n)$ queries, and this is known
to be tight. This implies that a $(2 + \varepsilon)$-approximate estimate of
Steiner Tree cost can be obtained with $\tilde{O}(k)$ queries by simply
applying the MST cost estimation algorithm on the metric induced by the
terminals.
  Our first result shows that any (randomized) algorithm that estimates the
Steiner Tree cost to within a $(5/3 - \varepsilon)$-factor requires
$\Omega(n^2)$ queries, even if $k$ is a constant. This lower bound is in sharp
contrast to an upper bound of $O(nk)$ queries for computing a
$(5/3)$-approximate Steiner Tree, which follows from previous work by Du and
Zelikovsky.
  Our second main result, and the main technical contribution of this work, is
a sublinear query algorithm for estimating the Steiner Tree cost to within a
strictly better-than-$2$ factor, with query complexity $\tilde{O}(n^{12/7} +
n^{6/7}\cdot k)=\tilde{O}(n^{13/7})=o(n^2)$. We complement this result by
showing an $\tilde{\Omega}(n + k^{6/5})$ query lower bound for any algorithm
that estimates Steiner Tree cost to a strictly better than $2$ factor. Thus
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{6/5})$ queries are needed to just beat $2$-approximation
when $k = \Omega(n)$; a sharp contrast to MST cost estimation where a
$(1+o(1))$-approximate estimate of cost is achievable with only $\tilde{O}(n)$
queries.

predominant statistical tool for quantifying data privacy in academic works.
Yet despite the plethora of research and open-source utilities that have
accompanied its rise, with limited exceptions, differential privacy has failed
to achieve widespread adoption in the enterprise domain. Our study aims to shed
light on the fundamental causes underlying this academic-industrial utilization
gap through detailed interviews of 24 privacy practitioners across 9 major
companies. We analyze the results of our survey to provide key findings and
suggestions for companies striving to improve privacy protection in their data
workflows and highlight the necessary and missing requirements of existing
differential privacy tools, with the goal of guiding researchers working
towards the broader adoption of differential privacy. Our findings indicate
that analysts suffer from lengthy bureaucratic processes for requesting access
to sensitive data, yet once granted, only scarcely-enforced privacy policies
stand between rogue practitioners and misuse of private information. We thus
argue that differential privacy can significantly improve the processes of
requesting and conducting data exploration across silos, and conclude that with
a few of the improvements suggested herein, the practical use of differential

computing as a profession (1950-1980) when U.S. government workforce statistics
are thin or non-existent. This longitudinal dataset, based on archival records
from six computer user groups (SHARE, USE, and others) and ACM conference

bias in computing emerged during professionalization of computer science in the
1960s or 1970s and that there was a 'linear' one-time onset of gender bias to
the present. Such a linear view also lent support to the ""pipeline"" model of
computing's ""losing"" women at successive career stages. Instead, this dataset
reveals three distinct periods of gender bias in computing and so invites
temporally distinct explanations for these changing dynamics. It significantly
revises both scholarly assessment and popular understanding about gender bias
in computing. It also draws attention to diversity within computing. One
consequence of this research for CS reform efforts today is data-driven
recognition that legacies of gender bias beginning in the mid-1980s (not in
earlier decades) is the problem. A second consequence is correcting the public
image of computer science: this research shows that gender bias is a contingent

Such bugs can generally not be handled with current APR approaches, so, as a
community, we need to develop complementary techniques.
  To stimulate the systematic study of alternative APR approaches and hybrid
APR combinations, we devise a novel bug classification system that enables
methodical analysis of their bug detection power and bug repair capabilities.
To demonstrate the benefits, we analyze the repair of termination bugs in

to finance benefits, and benefits that depend on earnings. This paper analyzes
theoretically and empirically the trade-off between social insurance and
incentive provision faced by reforms to these two attributes. First, I combine
the social insurance and the optimal linear-income literature to build a model
with a flexible pension contribution rate and benefits' progressivity that
incorporates inter-temporal and inter-worker types of redistribution and
incentive distortion. The model is general, allowing workers to be
heterogeneous on productivity and retirement preparedness, and they exhibit
present-focused bias. I then estimate the model by leveraging three
quasi-experimental variations on the design of the Chilean pension system and
administrative data merged with a panel survey. I find that taxable earnings
respond to changes in the benefit-earnings link, future pension payments, and
net-of-tax rate, which increases the costs of reforms. I also find that
lifetime payroll earnings have a strong positive relationship with productivity
and retirement preparedness, and that pension transfers are effective in

velocity dispersion. Our recessional velocity confirms association with the
Coma cluster and Y358's status as a UDG. From our velocity dispersion (19 $\pm$
3 km s$^{-1}$) we calculate a dynamical mass within the half-light radius which
provides evidence for a core in Y358's dark matter halo. We compare this
dynamical mass, along with those for globular cluster (GC)-rich/-poor UDGs in
the literature, to mass profiles for isolated, gas-rich UDGs and UDGs in the
NIHAO/FIRE simulations. We find GC-poor UDGs have dynamical masses similar to
isolated, gas-rich UDGs, suggesting an evolutionary pathway may exist between
the two. Conversely, GC-rich UDGs have dynamical masses too massive to be
easily explained as the evolution of the isolated, gas-rich UDGs. The simulated
UDGs match the dynamical masses of the GC-rich UDGs. However, once compared in
stellar mass -- halo mass space, the FIRE/NIHAO simulated UDGs do not match the
halo masses of either the isolated, gas-rich UDGs or the GC-rich UDGs at the
same stellar mass. Finally, we supplement our data for Y358 with other UDGs
that have measured velocity dispersions in the literature. We compare this
sample to a wide range of non-UDGs in mass-radius-luminosity space, finding
UDGs have a similar locus to non-UDGs of similar luminosity with the primary
difference being their larger half-light radii.

streaming algorithm for estimating the maximum directed cut size (Max-DICUT) in
a directed graph on $n$ vertices. This improves over an $O(\log n)$-space $4/9
< 0.45$ approximation algorithm due to Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy (FOCS
2020), which was known to be optimal for $o(\sqrt{n})$-space algorithms.
Max-DICUT is a special case of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). In this
broader context, we give the first CSP for which algorithms with
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ space can provably outperform $o(\sqrt{n})$-space
algorithms.
  The key technical contribution of our work is development of the notions of a
first-order snapshot of a (directed) graph and of estimates of such snapshots.
These snapshots can be used to simulate certain (non-streaming) Max-DICUT
algorithms, including the ""oblivious"" algorithms introduced by Feige and Jozeph
(Algorithmica, 2015), who showed that one such algorithm achieves a
0.483-approximation.
  Previous work of the authors (SODA 2023) studied the restricted case of
bounded-degree graphs, and observed that in this setting, it is straightforward
to estimate the snapshot with $\ell_1$ errors and this suffices to simulate
oblivious algorithms. But for unbounded-degree graphs, even defining an
achievable and sufficient notion of estimation is subtle. We describe a new
notion of snapshot estimation and prove its sufficiency using careful smoothing
techniques, and then develop an algorithm which sketches such an estimate via a
delicate process of intertwined vertex- and edge-subsampling.
  Prior to our work, the only streaming algorithms for any CSP on general
instances were based on generalizations of the $O(\log n)$-space algorithm for
Max-DICUT, and thus our work opens the possibility of a new class of algorithms
for approximating CSPs.

original motivation for studying this problem though, as well as modern

benefit from an improved {\it amortized} space complexity bound?
  We answer this question in the negative. Specifically, we prove a lower bound

quality of tracking is largely dependent on the quality of the detector used.
In many applications, such as autonomous vehicles, it is preferable to
over-detect objects to avoid catastrophic outcomes due to missed detections. As
a result, current state-of-the-art 3D detectors produce high rates of
false-positives to ensure a low number of false-negatives. This can negatively
affect tracking by making data association and track lifecycle management more
challenging. Additionally, occasional false-negative detections due to
difficult scenarios like occlusions can harm tracking performance. To address
these issues in a unified framework, we propose to learn shape and
spatio-temporal affinities between tracks and detections in consecutive frames.
Our affinity provides a probabilistic matching that leads to robust data
association, track lifecycle management, false-positive elimination,
false-negative propagation, and sequential track confidence refinement. Though
past 3D MOT approaches address a subset of components in this problem domain,
we offer the first self-contained framework that addresses all these aspects of
the 3D MOT problem. We quantitatively evaluate our method on the nuScenes
tracking benchmark where we achieve 1st place amongst LiDAR-only trackers using
CenterPoint detections. Our method estimates accurate and precise tracks, while
decreasing the overall number of false-positive and false-negative tracks and
increasing the number of true-positive tracks. We analyze our performance with
5 metrics, giving a comprehensive overview of our approach to indicate how our
tracking framework may impact the ultimate goal of an autonomous mobile agent.
We also present ablative experiments and qualitative results that demonstrate

images has drawn increasing attention. The existing image tampering
localization methods, however, suffer from severe performance degradation when
the tampered images are subjected to some post-processing, as the tampering
traces would be distorted by the post-processing operations. The poor
robustness against post-processing has become a bottleneck for the practical
applications of image tampering localization techniques. In order to address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel restoration-assisted framework for
image tampering localization (ReLoc). The ReLoc framework mainly consists of an
image restoration module and a tampering localization module. The key idea of
ReLoc is to use the restoration module to recover a high-quality counterpart of
the distorted tampered image, such that the distorted tampering traces can be
re-enhanced, facilitating the tampering localization module to identify the
tampered regions. To achieve this, the restoration module is optimized not only
with the conventional constraints on image visual quality but also with a
forensics-oriented objective function. Furthermore, the restoration module and
the localization module are trained alternately, which can stabilize the
training process and is beneficial for improving the performance. The proposed
framework is evaluated by fighting against JPEG compression, the most commonly
used post-processing. Extensive experimental results show that ReLoc can
significantly improve the robustness against JPEG compression. The restoration
module in a well-trained ReLoc model is transferable. Namely, it is still
effective when being directly deployed with another tampering localization
module.

spectral algorithms have been one of the most widely used frameworks. However,
despite the long history of study, there are still unsolved challenges. One of
the main open problems is the design and analysis of ""simple""(vanilla) spectral
algorithms, especially when the number of communities is large.
  In this paper, we provide two algorithms. The first one is based on the
power-iteration method. It is a simple algorithm which only compares the rows
of the powered adjacency matrix. Our algorithm performs optimally (up to
logarithmic factors) compared to the best known bounds in the dense graph
regime by Van Vu (Combinatorics Probability and Computing, 2018). Furthermore,
our algorithm is also robust to the ""small cluster barrier"", recovering large
clusters in the presence of an arbitrary number of small clusters. Then based
on a connection between the powered adjacency matrix and eigenvectors, we
provide a vanilla spectral algorithm for large number of communities in the
balanced case. This answers an open question by Van Vu (Combinatorics
Probability and Computing, 2018) in the balanced case. Our methods also
partially solve technical barriers discussed by Abbe, Fan, Wang and Zhong
(Annals of Statistics, 2020).
  In the technical side, we introduce a random partition method to analyze each
entry of a powered random matrix. This method can be viewed as an eigenvector
version of Wigner's trace method. Recall that Wigner's trace method links the
trace of powered matrix to eigenvalues. Our method links the whole powered
matrix to the span of eigenvectors. We expect our method to have more
applications in random matrix theory.

quantum data-access process, dubbed as quantum data-access machine (QDAM), and
present a general architecture for quantum search algorithm. We analyze the
runtime of our algorithm in view of the fault-tolerant quantum computation
(FTQC) consisting of logical qubits within an effective quantum error
correction code. Specifically, we introduce a measure involving two
computational complexities, i.e. quantum query and $T$-depth complexities,
which can be critical to assess performance since the logical non-Clifford
gates, such as the $T$ (i.e., $\pi/8$ rotation) gate, are known to be costliest
to implement in FTQC. Our analysis shows that for $N$ searching data, a QDAM
model exhibiting a logarithmic, i.e., $O(\log{N})$, growth of the $T$-depth
complexity can be constructed. Further analysis reveals that our QDAM-embedded
quantum search requires $O(\sqrt{N} \times \log{N})$ runtime cost. Our study
thus demonstrates that the quantum data search algorithm can truly speed up

but merging binaries with separations smaller than ~1 light days (~10^2
gravitational radii for 10^8 Msun), which are rapidly evolving under control of
gravitational waves, are elusive in observations. In this paper, we discuss
fates of mini-disks around component SMBHs for three regimes: 1) low rates
(advection-dominated accretion flows: ADAFs); 2) intermediate rates; 3)
super-Eddington accretion rates. Mini-disks with intermediate rates are
undergoing evaporation through thermal conduction of hot corona forming a
hybrid radial structure. When the binary orbital periods are shorter than sound
propagation timescales of the evaporated mini-disks, a new instability, denoted
as sound instability, arises because the disks will be highly twisted so that
they are destroyed. We demonstrate a critical separation of A_{crit}~10^2 Rg
from the sound instability of the mini-disks and the cavity is full of hot gas.
For those binaries, component SMBHs are accreting with Bondi mode in the ADAF
regime, showing periodic variations resulting from Doppler boosting effects in
radio from the ADAFs due to orbital motion. In the mean while, the circumbinary
disks (CBDs) are still not hot enough (ultraviolet deficit) to generate photons
to ionize gas for broad emission lines. For slightly super-Eddington accretion
of the CBDs, MgII line appears with decreases of UV deficit, and for
intermediate super-Eddington Balmer lines appear, but CIV line never unless CBD
accretion rates are extremely high. Moreover, if the CBDs are misaligned with
the binary plane, it is then expected to have optical periodical variations

models. We focus on the role of the effective mass, symmetry energy and pairing
force. Models are selected to have effective masses in the range $(0.58-1.05)M$
where $M$ is the nucleon mass in free space, and stiffness of the symmetry
energy is varied by choosing the slope of the symmetry energy in the range 9.4
-- 100.5 MeV. Effect of pairing force is investigated by calculating $R_{np}$
with and without pairing, and using two different forms of the pairing force.
With nine models, we obtain $R_{np} = 0.001 - 0.014$ fm. The result is
independent of the effective mass, symmetry energy, and the form of pairing
force. However, $R_{np}$ is negative when the pairing force is switched off, so
the pairing force plays an essential role to make $R_{np}$ positive and
constrained in a narrow range. We also calculate the PV asymmetry ($A_{\rm
pv}$) in the elastic electron-$^{27}$Al scattering in the Born approximation at
the kinematics of the Qweak experiment. We obtain a very narrow-ranged result
$A_{\rm pv} = $ (2.07 -- 2.09) $\times 10^{-6}$. The result is consistent with

theory, if there is a pre-defined order in a system in which the agents act,
the system is called sequential, otherwise it is non-sequential. Much of the
literature on stochastic control theory, such as studies on the existence
analysis, approximation methods, and on dynamic programming or other analytical
or learning theoretic methods, have focused on sequential systems. The static
reduction method for sequential control problems (via change of measures or
other techniques), in particular, has been shown to be very effective in
arriving at existence, structural, approximation and learning theoretic
results. Many practical systems, however, are non-sequential where the order of
agents acting is random, and dependent on the realization of solution paths and
prior actions taken. The study of such systems is particularly challenging as
tools applicable for sequential models are not directly applicable. In this
paper, we will study static reducibility of non-sequential stochastic control
systems, including by change of measure methods. We revisit the notion of
Causality (a definition due to Witsenhausen and which has been refined by
Andersland and Tekenetzis), and provide an alternative representation using
imaginary agents. Via this representation, we show that Causality, under an
absolute continuity condition, allows for an equivalent static model whose
reduction is policy-independent. This facilitates much of the stochastic
analysis available for sequential systems to also be applicable for
non-sequential systems. We further show that under more relaxed conditions on
the model, such as solvability, such a reduction, when possible at all, is

make sparsity problem particularly prominent in Open Knowledge Graphs

entities becomes difficult. We hypothesize that by introducing negative
samples, a contrastive learning (CL) formulation could be beneficial in such

entities ignoring the relation-guided ternary propagation patterns and they are
too generic, i.e., they ignore zero-shot, few-shot and synonymity problems that
appear in OpenKGs. To address this, we propose TernaryCL, a CL framework based
on ternary propagation patterns among head, relation and tail. TernaryCL
designs Contrastive Entity and Contrastive Relation to mine ternary
discriminative features with both negative entities and relations, introduces
Contrastive Self to help zero- and few-shot entities learn discriminative
features, Contrastive Synonym to model synonymous entities, and Contrastive
Fusion to aggregate graph features from multiple paths. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TernaryCL over state-of-the-art

OED under uncertainty within a unfied framework. We build on the Bayesian
approximation error (BAE) framework, to incorporate modeling uncertainties in
the Bayesian inverse problem, and methods for A-optimal design of
infinite-dimensional Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems. Specifically, a
Gaussian approximation to the posterior at the maximum a posteriori probability
point is used to define an uncertainty aware OED objective that is tractable to
evaluate and optimize. In particular, the OED objective can be computed at a
cost, in the number of PDE solves, that does not grow with the dimension of the
discretized inversion and secondary parameters. The OED problem is formulated
as a binary bilevel PDE constrained optimization problem and a greedy
algorithm, which provides a pragmatic approach, is used to find optimal
designs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for a model

a reasonable computation time. Accordingly, many algorithms have so far been
proposed. In general, the performance of heuristic algorithms strongly depends
on the instance of the combinatorial optimization problem to be solved because
they escape the local minima in different ways. Therefore, combining several
algorithms to exploit their complementary strength is effective for obtaining
highly accurate solutions for a wide range of combinatorial optimization
problems. However, quantum annealing cannot be used to improve a candidate
solution obtained by other algorithms because it starts from an initial state
where all spin configurations are found with a uniform probability. In this
study, we propose an Ising formulation of integer optimization problems to
utilize quantum annealing in the iterative improvement strategy. Our
formulation exploits the biased sampling of degenerated ground states in
transverse magnetic field quantum annealing. We also analytically show that a
first-order phase transition is successfully avoided for a fully connected
ferromagnetic Potts model if the overlap between a ground state and a candidate

the acoustic Debye temperature $\theta_a$ that can also be obtained within the

zincblende, rocksalt, and wurtzite compounds. The results are compared with
that from the experiment and the quasiharmonic Debye model (QDM). We find that
in general the prediction of $\theta_a$ is rather consistent among the GQA,

the GQA predicts the experimental trends of Gr\""uneisen parameters and
$\kappa_l$ more closely. We expect the GQA with the modified Slack formulae

carry strong electromagnetic fields that act as fields of photons. The exchange
of photons could induce photonuclear and two-photon interactions as well as
excite the ions into giant dipole resonances (GDRs) or even higher excitation.
The GDRs typically decay by emitting photons and even a single neutron, while
high-excited resonances usually decay by emitting two or more photons and/or
neutrons. On the other hand, the electromagnetic fields of heavy ions are very
strong, so one of the two colliding ions is enforced by the other's
electromagnetic field. As a result, the two colliding ions are pushed into
opposite directions by the electromagnetic forces, and thus the neutrons
emitted from different ions could present a back-to-back correlation. Using a
Monte-Carlo simulation implementing the electromagnetic fields as well as the
neutron emission from previous measurements or model calculations, we
qualitatively demonstrate that the above electromagnetic effect is large enough
to be observed in UPC, which would provide a clear means to study the strong

privilege an arrow of time, and the quantum-mechanical wave function describes
a high-dimensional reality that is radically different from our ordinary
experiences.
  In this paper, I characterize and elaborate on the ''Wentaculus'' theory, a
new approach to time's arrow in a quantum universe that offers a unified
solution to both problems. Central to the Wentaculus are (i) Density Matrix
Realism, the idea that the quantum state of the universe is objective but can
be impure, and (ii) the Initial Projection Hypothesis, a new law of nature that
selects a unique initial quantum state. On the Wentaculus, the quantum state of
the universe is sufficiently simple to be a law, and the arrow of time can be
traced back to an exact boundary condition. It removes the intrinsic vagueness
of the Past Hypothesis, eliminates the Statistical Postulate, provides a higher
degree of theoretical unity, and contains a natural realization of ''strong
determinism.'' I end by responding to four recent objections. In a companion
paper, I elaborate on Density Matrix Realism.

reaching a luminosity limit of $\nu L_\nu\lesssim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$

constraints in the context of FRB emission models, such as the pulsar

limits in the context of the synchrotron maser model, we find that they
constrain the flare energies to $\lesssim 10^{43}-10^{49}$ erg (depending on
the distances of the various repeating FRBs, with $\lesssim 10^{39}$ erg for
the Galactic SGR 1935+2154). These limits are generally at least an order of

maximum bound principle (MBP) and energy dissipation law; for the former, that
means the absolute value of the solution is pointwisely bounded for all the

The model equation is first discretized in space by the central finite
difference, then by iteratively using Duhamel's formula, first- and
second-order low regularity integrators (LRIs) are constructed for time
discretization of the semi-discrete system. The proposed LRI schemes are proved
to preserve the MBP and the energy stability in the discrete sense.
Furthermore, their temporal error estimates are also successfully derived under
a low regularity requirement that the exact solution of the semi-discrete

connection between this problem and causal discovery in the presence of
unobserved parentless causes, in the sense that there is a mapping, given by
the mixing matrix, between the underlying models to be inferred in these
problems. Consequently, any identifiability result based on the mixing matrix
for one model translates to an identifiability result for the other model. We
characterize to what extent the causal models can be identified under a
two-part faithfulness assumption. Under only the first part of the assumption
(corresponding to the conventional definition of faithfulness), the structure
can be learned up to the causal ordering among an ordered grouping of the
variables but not all the edges across the groups can be identified. We further
show that if both parts of the faithfulness assumption are imposed, the
structure can be learned up to a more refined ordered grouping. As a result of
this refinement, for the latent variable model with unobserved parentless
causes, the structure can be identified. Based on our theoretical results, we

robust statistics, and computational geometry. One chief barrier to its broader
practical utility is that many common measures of depth are computationally
intensive, requiring on the order of $n^d$ operations to exactly compute the
depth of a single point within a data set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional
space. Often however, we are not directly interested in the absolute depths of
the points, but rather in their relative ordering. For example, we may want to
find the most central point in a data set (a generalized median), or to
identify and remove all outliers (points on the fringe of the data set with low
depth). With this observation, we develop a novel and instance-adaptive
algorithm for adaptive data depth computation by reducing the problem of
exactly computing $n$ depths to an $n$-armed stochastic multi-armed bandit
problem which we can efficiently solve. We focus our exposition on simplicial
depth, developed by Liu (1990), which has emerged as a promising notion of
depth due to its interpretability and asymptotic properties. We provide general
instance-dependent theoretical guarantees for our proposed algorithms, which
readily extend to many other common measures of data depth including majority
depth, Oja depth, and likelihood depth. When specialized to the case where the
gaps in the data follow a power law distribution with parameter $\alpha<2$, we
show that we can reduce the complexity of identifying the deepest point in the
data set (the simplicial median) from $O(n^d)$ to
$\tilde{O}(n^{d-(d-1)\alpha/2})$, where $\tilde{O}$ suppresses logarithmic
factors. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical experiments on

domain adaptation method by filling vocabulary and word-frequency gaps. First,
we expand a vocabulary and execute continual pretraining with a masked language
model on a corpus of the target domain. Then, we multiply SPLADE-encoded sparse
vectors by inverse document frequency weights to consider the importance of
documents with lowfrequency words. We conducted experiments using our method on
datasets with a large vocabulary gap from a source domain. We show that our
method outperforms the present stateof-the-art domain adaptation method. In
addition, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, combined with BM25.

  Torralba, Taipeng Tian, Ser-Nam Lim","$BT^2$: Backward-compatible Training with Basis Transformation","13 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern retrieval system often requires recomputing the representation of
every piece of data in the gallery when updating to a better representation
model. This process is known as backfilling and can be especially costly in the
real world where the gallery often contains billions of samples. Recently,
researchers have proposed the idea of Backward Compatible Training (BCT) where
the new representation model can be trained with an auxiliary loss to make it
backward compatible with the old representation. In this way, the new
representation can be directly compared with the old representation, in
principle avoiding the need for any backfilling. However, followup work shows
that there is an inherent tradeoff where a backward compatible representation
model cannot simultaneously maintain the performance of the new model itself.
This paper reports our ``not-so-surprising'' finding that adding extra
dimensions to the representation can help here. However, we also found that
naively increasing the dimension of the representation did not work. To deal
with this, we propose Backward-compatible Training with a novel Basis
Transformation ($BT^2$). A basis transformation (BT) is basically a learnable
set of parameters that applies an orthonormal transformation. Such a
transformation possesses an important property whereby the original information
contained in its input is retained in its output. We show in this paper how a
BT can be utilized to add only the necessary amount of additional dimensions.
We empirically verify the advantage of $BT^2$ over other state-of-the-art
methods in a wide range of settings. We then further extend $BT^2$ to other
challenging yet more practical settings, including significant change in model
architecture (CNN to Transformers), modality change, and even a series of
updates in the model architecture mimicking the evolution of deep learning
models.

Change Point Detection (CPD) methods have a limitation in tracking changes in

essential. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose TiVaCPD,
an approach that uses a Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (TVGL) to identify changes
in correlation patterns between multidimensional features over time, and
combines that with an aggregate Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test to

online decision making problem (ODMP) as a natural generalization of OLP. In
ODMP, there exists a single decision maker who makes a series of decisions
spread out over a total of $T$ time stages. At each time stage, the decision
maker makes a decision based on information obtained up to that point without
seeing into the future. The task of the decision maker is to maximize the
accumulated reward while overall meeting some predetermined $m$-dimensional
long-term goal (linking) constraints. ODMP significantly broadens the modeling
framework of OLP by allowing more general feasible regions (for local and goal
constraints) potentially involving both discreteness and nonlinearity in each
local decision making problem.
  We propose a Fenchel dual-based online algorithm for ODMP. At each time
stage, the proposed algorithm requires solving a potentially nonconvex

problem over the goal set. Under the uniform random permutation model, we show
that our algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{mT})$ constraint violation

risk is reflected not only intuitively in the collision risk with objects
outside the autonomous vehicles (AVs), but also inherently in the performance
limitation risk of the implemented algorithms themselves. How to minimize the
SOTIF risk for autonomous driving is currently a critical, difficult, and

risk, which aims to provide a systematic solution for monitoring,
quantification, and mitigation of inherent and external risks. The core of this
system is the risk monitoring of the implemented artificial intelligence

YOLOv5 is highlighted. Moreover, the inherent perception algorithm risk and
external collision risk are jointly quantified via SOTIF entropy, which is then
propagated downstream to the decision-making module and mitigated. Finally,
several challenging scenarios are demonstrated, and the Hardware-in-the-Loop

techniques, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis process has mostly remained
untouched and still involves manual investigation, comparison, and
verification. Due to the large volume of XRD samples from high-throughput XRD
experiments, it has become impossible for domain scientists to process them
manually. Recently, they have started leveraging standard clustering
techniques, to reduce the XRD pattern representations requiring manual efforts
for labeling and verification. Nevertheless, these standard clustering
techniques do not handle problem-specific aspects such as peak shifting,
adjacent peaks, background noise, and mixed phases; hence, resulting in
incorrect composition-phase diagrams that complicate further steps. Here, we
leverage data mining techniques along with domain expertise to handle these
issues. In this paper, we introduce an incremental phase mapping approach based
on binary peak representations using a new threshold based fuzzy dissimilarity
measure. The proposed approach first applies an incremental phase computation
algorithm on discrete binary peak representation of XRD samples, followed by
hierarchical clustering or manual merging of similar pure phases to obtain the
final composition-phase diagram. We evaluate our method on the composition
space of two ternary alloy systems- Co-Ni-Ta and Co-Ti-Ta. Our results are
verified by domain scientists and closely resembles the manually computed
ground-truth composition-phase diagrams. The proposed approach takes us closer
towards achieving the goal of complete end-to-end automated XRD analysis.

alternative approach: By stacking graphene on top of another van der Waals

applications range from providing first impressions of wave interference in
educational settings to probing spacetime at minuscule precision scales.
Interferometer precision provides a unique view of the fundamental medium of
matter and energy, enabling tests for new physics as well as searches for the
gravitational wave signatures of distant astrophysical events. Optical
interferometers are typically operated by continuously measuring the power at
their output port. Signal perturbations then create sideband fields, forming a
beat-note with the fringe light that modulates that power. When operated at a
nearly-dark destructive interference fringe, this readout is a form of homodyne
detection, with an imprecision set by a ``standard quantum limit'' attributed
to shot noise from quantum vacuum fluctuations. The sideband signal fields
carry energy which can, alternatively, be directly observed as photons distinct
from the source laser. Without signal energy, vacuum does not form sidebands
and cannot spuriously create photon counts or shot noise. Thus, counting can
offer improved statistics when searching for weak signals when classical
backgrounds are below the standard quantum limit. Here, photon counting
statistics are described for optical interferometry, relating the two forms of
measurement and showing cases where counting greatly outperforms homodyne
readout, even with squeezed state quantum enhancement. The most immediate
application for photon counting is improving searches of stochastic signals,
such as from quantum gravity or from new particle fields. The advantages of
counting may extend to wider applications, such as gravitational wave
detectors, and the concept of Fisher-information representative spectral
density is introduced to motivate further study.

sensor positions from N candidates where M < N. Most existing methods assume
that sensors are static, i.e., they do not move, however, many mobile sensors
like drones, robots, and vehicles can change their positions over time.
Moreover, underlying measurement conditions could also be changed that are
difficult to cover the statically placed sensors. We tackle the problem by
allowing the sensors to change their positions in their neighbors on the
network. Based on a perspective of dictionary learning, we sequentially learn
the dictionary from a pool of observed signals on the network based on graph
sampling theory. Using the learned dictionary, we dynamically determine the
sensor positions such that the non-observed signals on the network can be best
recovered from the observations. Furthermore, sensor positions in each time

In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method via the
mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed signals. The proposed dynamic
sensor placement outperforms the existing static ones both in synthetic and

is said to be super edge-magic if $f\left(V \left(G\right)\right) =\left\{1, 2,

super edge-magic deficiency $ \mu_{s}\left(G\right)$ of a graph $G$ is defined
to be either the smallest nonnegative integer $n$ with the property that $G
\cup nK_{1}$ is super edge-magic or $+ \infty$ if there exists no such integer
$n$. In this paper, we introduce the parameter $l\left(n\right)$ as the minimum
size of a graph $G$ of order $n$ for which all graphs of order $n$ and size at
least $l\left(n\right)$ have $\mu_{s} \left( G \right)=+\infty $, and provide
lower and upper bounds for $l\left(G\right)$. Imran, Baig, and
Fe\u{n}ov\u{c}\'{i}kov\'{a} established that for integers $n$ with $n\equiv
0\pmod{4}$, $ \mu_{s}\left(D_{n}\right) \leq 3n/2-1$, where $D_{n}$ is the
cartesian product of the cycle $C_{n}$ of order $n$ and the complete graph
$K_{2}$ of order $2$. We improve this bound by showing that $
\mu_{s}\left(D_{n}\right) \leq n+1$ when $n \geq 4$ is even. Enomoto,
Llad\'{o}, Nakamigawa, and Ringel posed the conjecture that every nontrivial
tree is super edge-magic. We propose a new approach to attak this conjecture.
This approach may also help to resolve another labeling conjecture on trees by
Graham and Sloane.

structural information via the Hilbert curve, which maps high-dimensional (>=2)
representations to one-dimensional continuous space-filling curves. Since the
distilled 2D networks are supervised by the curves converted from dimensionally
heterogeneous 3D features, the 2D networks are given an informative view in
terms of learning structural information embedded in well-trained
high-dimensional representations. We further propose a Variable-length Hilbert
Distillation (VHD) method to dynamically shorten the walking stride of the
Hilbert curve in activation feature areas and lengthen the stride in context
feature areas, forcing the 2D networks to pay more attention to learning from
activation features. The proposed algorithm outperforms the current
state-of-the-art distillation techniques adapted to cross-dimensionality
distillation on two classification tasks. Moreover, the distilled 2D networks
by the proposed method achieve competitive performance with the original 3D

the substitution of cumbersome 3D networks in the real-world scenario.

isomorphic to an existing query graph. Subgraph matching is an NP-hard problem,
yet has found its applications in many areas. Many learning-based methods have
been proposed for graph matching, whereas few have been designed for subgraph
matching. The subgraph matching problem is generally more challenging, mainly
due to the different sizes between the two graphs, resulting in considerable
large space of solutions. Also the extra edges existing in the data graph
connecting to the matched nodes may lead to two matched nodes of two graphs
having different adjacency structures and often being identified as distinct
objects. Due to the extra edges, the existing learning based methods often fail
to generate sufficiently similar node-level embeddings for matched nodes. This
study proposes a novel Adaptive Edge-Deleting Network (AEDNet) for subgraph
matching. The proposed method is trained in an end-to-end fashion. In AEDNet, a
novel sample-wise adaptive edge-deleting mechanism removes extra edges to
ensure consistency of adjacency structure of matched nodes, while a
unidirectional cross-propagation mechanism ensures consistency of features of
matched nodes. We applied the proposed method on six datasets with graph sizes
varying from 20 to 2300. Our evaluations on six open datasets demonstrate that

based on priors placed directly on the discrete distribution of the ordinal
responses. The prior probability models are built from a structured mixture of
multinomial distributions. We leverage a continuation-ratio logits
representation to formulate the mixture kernel, with mixture weights defined
through the logit stick-breaking process that incorporates the covariates
through a linear function. The implied regression functions for the response
probabilities can be expressed as weighted sums of parametric regression
functions, with covariate-dependent weights. Thus, the modeling approach
achieves flexible ordinal regression relationships, avoiding linearity or
additivity assumptions in the covariate effects. A key model feature is that
the parameters for both the mixture kernel and the mixture weights can be
associated with a continuation-ratio logits regression structure. Hence, an
efficient and relatively easy to implement posterior simulation method can be
designed, using P\'olya-Gamma data augmentation. Moreover, the model is built
from a conditional independence structure for category-specific parameters,
which results in additional computational efficiency gains through partial
parallel sampling. In addition to the general mixture structure, we study
simplified model versions that incorporate covariate dependence only in the
mixture kernel parameters or only in the mixture weights. For all proposed

Monte Carlo methods for posterior simulation. The methodology is illustrated

we propose a graph-based method for systematically searching for schemes that
can produce genuine entanglement in arbitrary N-partite linear bosonic systems,
without postselection. While the entanglement generation without postselection
renders more tolerable schemes for quantum tasks, it is in general more
challenging to find appropriate circuits for systems with a large number of
parties. We present a straightforward strategy to mitigate the limitation
through the implementation of our graph technique. Our physical setup is based
on the sculpting protocol, which utilizes an $ N$ indeterministic subtractions
of single bosons to convert Fock states of evenly distributed bosons into
entanglement. We have identified general schemes for qubit N-partite GHZ and W
states. These schemes are significantly more efficient than previous schemes.
Furthermore, we have found an N-partite GHZ state generation scheme for qudits,
which was never proposed before to our knowledge because of their complicated
structures. These results demonstrate the power of our approach in discovering
simple solutions for the generation of intricate entangled states. Our schemes
can be directly realizable in many-boson systems. As a proof of concept, we

heralding detections. Our method has yet to exhaust its potential, and is

software developed ad-hoc by individual scientists or small teams. Often there

consequence is twofold. First, subsequent researchers must spend significant
work hours building upon the proposed hypotheses or experimental framework. In
the worst case, others cannot reproduce the experiment and reuse the findings
for subsequent research. Second, suppose the ad-hoc research software fails
during often long-running computationally expensive experiments. In that case,
the overall effort to iteratively improve the software and rerun the

making caching an integral part of the research software development process,

recommendations for developing research software in data science projects. Our
recommendations provide a perspective to circumvent common problems such as
propriety dependence, speed, etc. At the same time, caching contributes to the
reproducibility of experiments in the open science workflow. Concerning the
four guiding principles, i.e., Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability,

learning as well as some preliminary Riemannian and hyperbolic geometry. We

2) pseudo-annotations of speech data, and 3) extraction of ATC-related named

The ATCO2-PL-set corpus consists of 5281 hours of unlabeled ATC data enriched

for ferroelectricity, mainly existing in compounds. However, it is usually rare

Here, we report an unexpected room-temperature ferroelectricity in few-chain Te

piezoresponse force microscopy. Through density functional theory, we attribute
the ferroelectricity to the ion-displacement created by the interlayer
interaction between lone pair electrons. Ferroelectric polarization can induce
a strong field effect on the transport along the Te chain, supporting a
self-gated field-effect transistor. It enables a nonvolatile memory with high
in-plane mobility, zero supply voltage, multilevel resistive states, and a high

measures how far any two square patterns of size n can be glued, which can be
seen as a measure of the range of order, and affects the possibility to compute
the entropy (or free energy per site) of a shift. This motivates a study of the
possible behaviors of the gluing gap. The class of Hom shifts has the interest
that mixing type properties can be formulated in terms of algebraic graph
theory, which has received a lot of attention recently. Improving some former

considering the very distinct mode behaviors under different polarizations in

have been studied. In this paper we analyze several dual-polarization-MWBs
based on different bending curve functions. These special curve-based silicon
MWBs have the advantages of easy fabrication and low loss compared with other
structures based on the subwavelength structures such as gratings. A comparison
is made between the free-form curve, Bezier curve, and Euler curve, which are
used in the bending region instead of a conventional arc. The transmission
spectra of the first three TE and TM modes in the silicon multimode waveguide
with a core thickness of 340 nm are investigated. The simulation results
indicate that in the premise of the same effective radius which is only 10 in
this paper, the 6-mode MWB based on the free-form curve has the optimal
performances, including an extremely low loss below 0.052dB and low crosstalk
below -25.97dB for all six modes in the wide band of 1500-1600 nm. The MWBs
based on the Bezier and Euler curve have degraded performances in terms of the

  Bilevel Programming",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Bilevel programming has recently received attention in the literature, due to
a wide range of applications, including reinforcement learning and
hyper-parameter optimization. However, it is widely assumed that the underlying
bilevel optimization problem is solved either by a single machine or in the
case of multiple machines connected in a star-shaped network, i.e., federated
learning setting. The latter approach suffers from a high communication cost on
the central node (e.g., parameter server) and exhibits privacy vulnerabilities.
Hence, it is of interest to develop methods that solve bilevel optimization
problems in a communication-efficient decentralized manner. To that end, this
paper introduces a penalty function based decentralized algorithm with
theoretical guarantees for this class of optimization problems. Specifically, a
distributed alternating gradient-type algorithm for solving consensus bilevel
programming over a decentralized network is developed. A key feature of the
proposed algorithm is to estimate the hyper-gradient of the penalty function
via decentralized computation of matrix-vector products and few vector
communications, which is then integrated within our alternating algorithm to
give the finite-time convergence analysis under different convexity
assumptions. Owing to the generality of this complexity analysis, our result
yields convergence rates for a wide variety of consensus problems including

simulate open system quantum dynamics, which allows for systematic convergence
to numerically exact results. To represent the effects of the bath, the
reservoir correlation functions are usually decomposed into the summation of
multiple exponential terms in the HEOM method. Since the reservoir correlation
functions become highly non-Markovian at low temperatures or when the bath has
complex band structures, a present challenge is to obtain accurate exponential
decompositions that allow efficient simulation with the HEOM. In this work, we
employ the barycentric representation to approximate the Fermi function and
hybridization functions in the frequency domain. The new method, by
approximating these functions with optimized rational decomposition, greatly
reduces the number of basis functions in decomposing the reservoir correlation
functions, which further allows the HEOM method to be applied to ultra-low
temperature and general bath structures. We demonstrate the efficiency,
accuracy, and long-time stability of the new decomposition scheme by applying
it to the Anderson impurity model (AIM) in the low-temperature regime with the
Lorentzian and tight-binding hybridization functions.

New microcalcifications were simulated using randomly sampled principal

and their realism was appreciated through visual assessment. Preliminary
results have shown that input microcalcifications can be reconstructed with
high visual fidelity when using 62 principal components, representing 99.5%

discrete-time control systems. Pre-opacity is an important information-flow
security property that secures the intention of a system to execute some secret
behaviors in the future. Existing works on pre-opacity only consider non-metric
discrete systems, where it is assumed that intruders can distinguish different
output behaviors precisely. However, for continuous-space control systems whose
output sets are equipped with metrics (which is the case for most real-world
applications), it is too restrictive to assume precise measurements from
outside observers. In this paper, we first introduce a concept of approximate
pre-opacity by capturing the security level of control systems with respect to
the measurement precision of the intruder. Based on this new notion of
pre-opacity, we propose a verification approach for continuous-space control
systems by leveraging abstraction-based techniques. In particular, a new
concept of approximate pre-opacity preserving simulation relation is introduced
to characterize the distance between two systems in terms of preserving
pre-opacity. This new system relation allows us to verify pre-opacity of
complex continuous-space control systems using their finite abstractions. We
also present a method to construct pre-opacity preserving finite abstractions
for a class of discrete-time control systems under certain stability
assumptions.

who can best function as an unavailable subset of members (i.e., subteam) for
certain reasons (e.g., conflicts of interests, employee churn), given a team of
people embedded in a social network working on the same task. Prior
investigations on this problem incorporate graph kernel as the optimal criteria
for measuring the similarity between the new optimized team and the original
team. However, the increasingly abundant social networks reveal fundamental
limitations of existing methods, including (1) the graph kernel-based
approaches are powerless to capture the key intrinsic correlations among node
features, (2) they generally search over the entire network for every member to
be replaced, making it extremely inefficient as the network grows, and (3) the
requirement of equal-sized replacement for the unavailable subteam can be
inapplicable due to limited hiring budget. In this work, we address the
limitations in the state-of-the-art for subteam replacement by (1) proposing
GENIUS, a novel clustering-based graph neural network (GNN) framework that can
capture team network knowledge for flexible subteam replacement, and (2)
equipping the proposed GENIUS with self-supervised positive team contrasting
training scheme to improve the team-level representation learning and
unsupervised node clusters to prune candidates for fast computation. Through
extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method (1) effectiveness: being able to select better candidate members that
significantly increase the similarity between the optimized and original teams,
and (2) efficiency: achieving more than 600 times speed-up in average running
time.

  https://github.com/JooyoungLeeETRI/SCR",,,,"eess.IV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, many neural network-based image compression methods have shown
promising results superior to the existing tool-based conventional codecs.
However, most of them are often trained as separate models for different target
bit rates, thus increasing the model complexity. Therefore, several studies
have been conducted for learned compression that supports variable rates with
single models, but they require additional network modules, layers, or inputs
that often lead to complexity overhead, or do not provide sufficient coding
efficiency. In this paper, we firstly propose a selective compression method
that partially encodes the latent representations in a fully generalized manner
for deep learning-based variable-rate image compression. The proposed method
adaptively determines essential representation elements for compression of
different target quality levels. For this, we first generate a 3D importance
map as the nature of input content to represent the underlying importance of
the representation elements. The 3D importance map is then adjusted for
different target quality levels using importance adjustment curves. The
adjusted 3D importance map is finally converted into a 3D binary mask to
determine the essential representation elements for compression. The proposed
method can be easily integrated with the existing compression models with a
negligible amount of overhead increase. Our method can also enable continuously
variable-rate compression via simple interpolation of the importance adjustment
curves among different quality levels. The extensive experimental results show
that the proposed method can achieve comparable compression efficiency as those
of the separately trained reference compression models and can reduce decoding
time owing to the selective compression. The sample codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/JooyoungLeeETRI/SCR.

private learning techniques on generated explanations for DL-based models. In
an extensive experimental analysis covering various image and time series
datasets from multiple domains, as well as varying privacy techniques, XAI
methods, and model architectures, the effects of private training on generated
explanations are studied. The findings suggest non-negligible changes in
explanations through the introduction of privacy. Apart from reporting
individual effects of PPML on XAI, the paper gives clear recommendations for
the choice of techniques in real applications. By unveiling the
interdependencies of these pivotal technologies, this work is a first step
towards overcoming the remaining hurdles for practically applicable AI in
safety-critical domains.

  Decomposition","Accepted to SODA 2023",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Greedy BST (or simply Greedy) is an online self-adjusting binary search tree
defined in the geometric view ([Lucas, 1988; Munro, 2000; Demaine, Harmon,
Iacono, Kane, Patrascu, SODA 2009). Along with Splay trees (Sleator, Tarjan
1985), Greedy is considered the most promising candidate for being dynamically
optimal, i.e., starting with any initial tree, their access costs on any
sequence is conjectured to be within $O(1)$ factor of the offline optimal.
However, in the past four decades, the question has remained elusive even for
highly restricted input.
  In this paper, we prove new bounds on the cost of Greedy in the ''pattern
avoidance'' regime. Our new results include:
  The (preorder) traversal conjecture for Greedy holds up to a factor of
$O(2^{\alpha(n)})$, improving upon the bound of $2^{\alpha(n)^{O(1)}}$ in
(Chalermsook et al., FOCS 2015). This is the best known bound obtained by any
online BSTs.
  We settle the postorder traversal conjecture for Greedy.
  The deque conjecture for Greedy holds up to a factor of $O(\alpha(n))$,
improving upon the bound $2^{O(\alpha(n))}$ in (Chalermsook, et al., WADS
2015).
  The split conjecture holds for Greedy up to a factor of $O(2^{\alpha(n)})$.
  Key to all these results is to partition (based on the input structures) the
execution log of Greedy into several simpler-to-analyze subsets for which
classical forbidden submatrix bounds can be leveraged. Finally, we show the
applicability of this technique to handle a class of increasingly complex
pattern-avoiding input sequences, called $k$-increasing sequences.
  As a bonus, we discover a new class of permutation matrices whose extremal
bounds are polynomially bounded. This gives a partial progress on an open
question by Jacob Fox (2013).

functors. As a consequence, we show that the exponential factors and the
irregularities of the Fourier transform of a holonomic D-module are described
geometrically by the stationary phase method, as in the classical case of
dimension one. A new feature in the higher-dimensional case is that we have
some extra rank jump of the Fourier transform produced by the singularities of
the linear perturbations of the exponential factors at their points of
indeterminacy. In the course of our study, not necessarily homogeneous
Lagrangian cycles that we call irregular characteristic cycles will play a
crucial role.

theory. It is well-known that computing an exact pure Nash equilibrium in these

We present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes $2.7371$-approximate pure
Nash equilibria in cut games. This is the first improvement to the previously
best-known bound of $3$, due to the work of Bhalgat, Chakraborty, and Khanna
from EC 2010. Our algorithm is based on a general recipe proposed by
Caragiannis, Fanelli, Gravin, and Skopalik from FOCS 2011 and applied on
several potential games since then. The first novelty of our work is the
introduction of a phase that can identify subsets of players who can
simultaneously improve their utilities considerably. This is done via
semidefinite programming and randomized rounding. In particular, a negative
objective value to the semidefinite program guarantees that no such
considerable improvement is possible for a given set of players. Otherwise,
randomized rounding of the SDP solution is used to identify a set of players
who can simultaneously improve their strategies considerably and allows the
algorithm to make progress. The way rounding is performed is another important
novelty of our work. Here, we exploit an idea that dates back to a paper by
Feige and Goemans from 1995, but we take it to an extreme that has not been

electronic devices. This is motivated both by increased device performance and
by the studies of materials themselves. An important type of device is a
Josephson junction based on the proximity effect between a quantum material and
a superconductor, useful for fundamental research as well as for quantum and
other technologies. When both junction contacts are placed on the same surface,
such as a two-dimensional material, the junction is called ``planar"". One
outstanding challenge is that not all materials are amenable to the standard
planar junction fabrication. The device quality, rather than the intrinsic
characteristics, may be defining the results. Here, we introduce a technique in
which nanowires are placed on the surface and act as a shadow mask for the
superconductor. The advantages are that the smallest dimension is determined by
the nanowire diameter and does not require lithography, and that the junction
is not exposed to chemicals such as etchants. We demonstrate this method with
an InAs quantum well, using two superconductors - Al and Sn, and two
semiconductor nanowires - InAs and InSb. The junctions exhibit critical current
levels consistent with transparent interfaces and uniform width. We show that
the template nanowire can be operated as a self-aligned electrostatic gate.
Beyond single junctions, we create SQUIDs with two gate-tunable junctions. We
suggest that our method can be used for a large variety of quantum materials
including van der Waals layers, topological insulators, Weyl semimetals and
future materials for which proximity effect devices is a promising research

  Mechanism Design",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR cs.GT cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) has achieved great success as a privacy-preserving
distributed training paradigm, where many edge devices collaboratively train a
machine learning model by sharing the model updates instead of the raw data
with a server. However, the heterogeneous computational and communication
resources of edge devices give rise to stragglers that significantly decelerate
the training process. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel FL framework
named stochastic coded federated learning (SCFL) that leverages coded computing
techniques. In SCFL, before the training process starts, each edge device
uploads a privacy-preserving coded dataset to the server, which is generated by
adding Gaussian noise to the projected local dataset. During training, the
server computes gradients on the global coded dataset to compensate for the
missing model updates of the straggling devices. We design a gradient
aggregation scheme to ensure that the aggregated model update is an unbiased
estimate of the desired global update. Moreover, this aggregation scheme
enables periodical model averaging to improve the training efficiency. We
characterize the tradeoff between the convergence performance and privacy
guarantee of SCFL. In particular, a more noisy coded dataset provides stronger
privacy protection for edge devices but results in learning performance
degradation. We further develop a contract-based incentive mechanism to
coordinate such a conflict. The simulation results show that SCFL learns a
better model within the given time and achieves a better privacy-performance
tradeoff than the baseline methods. In addition, the proposed incentive
mechanism grants better training performance than the conventional Stackelberg
game approach.

designated (possibly composite) column of an answer to a full conjunctive

where the bounds are taken over all repairs. Ariel Fuxman defined in his PhD

computation can be done by executing two first-order queries (one for lower
bounds, and one for upper bounds) followed by simple counting steps. We use the
term ""parsimonious counting"" for this computation. A natural question is
whether C_forest contains all self-join-free conjunctive queries that admit
parsimonious counting. We answer this question negatively. We define a new
syntactic class of queries, called C_parsimony, and prove that it contains all

the probability of extreme precipitation increases with time since 1950 in all

arriving online with values drawn independently from known distributions. On
seeing an item, the gambler must choose whether to accept its value as her
reward and quit the game, or reject it and continue. The gambler's aim is to
maximize her expected reward relative to the expected maximum of the values of
all items. Since the seventies, a tight bound of 1/2 has been known for this
competitive ratio in the setting where the items arrive in an adversarial order
(Krengel and Sucheston, 1977, 1978). However, the optimum ratio still remains
unknown in the order selection setting, where the gambler selects the arrival
order, as well as in prophet secretary, where the items arrive in a random
order. Moreover, it is not even known whether a separation exists between the
two settings.
  In this paper, we show that the power of order selection allows the gambler
to guarantee a strictly better competitive ratio than if the items arrive
randomly. For the order selection setting, we identify an instance for which
Peng and Tang's (FOCS'22) state-of-the-art algorithm performs no better than
their claimed competitive ratio of (approximately) 0.7251, thus illustrating
the need for an improved approach. We therefore extend their design and provide
a more general algorithm design framework, using which we show that their ratio
can be beaten, by designing a 0.7258-competitive algorithm. For the random
order setting, we improve upon Correa, Saona and Ziliotto's (SODA'19)
0.732-hardness result to show a hardness of 0.7254 for general algorithms -
even in the setting where the gambler knows the arrival order beforehand, thus
establishing a separation between the order selection and random order
settings.

However, process executions are increasingly viewed as partially ordered

However, commercial drones can generally only carry 10 % - 30 % of their own
mass as payload, which limits the amount of food delivery in a single flight.
One novel solution to noticeably increase the food-carrying ratio of a drone,
is recreating some structures of a drone, such as the wings, with edible
materials. We thus propose a drone, which is no longer only a food transporting
aircraft, but itself is partially edible, increasing its food-carrying mass
ratio to 50 %, owing to its edible wings. Furthermore, should the edible drone
be left behind in the environment after performing its task in an emergency

leaving less waste in the environment. Here we describe the choice of materials

however, still unclear how the synthetic 2D Chern number is related to the
Chern number that is defined from a parametric variable that evolves with time.
Here we show that in periodically driven systems in the adiabatic limit, the
synthetic 2D Chern number is a multiple of the Chern number defined from the
parametric variable. The synthetic 2D Chern number can thus be engineered via
how the parametric variable evolves in its own space. We justify our claims by
investigating Thouless pumping in two 1D tight-binding models, a three-site

learning paradigm that avoids the transmission of data generated on the users'
side. Although data are not transmitted, edge devices have to deal with limited
communication bandwidths, data heterogeneity, and straggler effects due to the
limited computational resources of users' devices. A prominent approach to
overcome such difficulties is FedADMM, which is based on the classical
two-operator consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The
common assumption of FL algorithms, including FedADMM, is that they learn a
global model using data only on the users' side and not on the edge server.
However, in edge learning, the server is expected to be near the base station
and have direct access to rich datasets. In this paper, we argue that
leveraging the rich data on the edge server is much more beneficial than
utilizing only user datasets. Specifically, we show that the mere application
of FL with an additional virtual user node representing the data on the edge
server is inefficient. We propose FedTOP-ADMM, which generalizes FedADMM and is
based on a three-operator ADMM-type technique that exploits a smooth cost
function on the edge server to learn a global model parallel to the edge
devices. Our numerical experiments indicate that FedTOP-ADMM has substantial
gain up to 33\% in communication efficiency to reach a desired test accuracy
with respect to FedADMM, including a virtual user on the edge server.

independent set of $G$ if no $k$ vertices in $I$ form a $k$-clique of $G$. An
independent set is a $2$-clique independent set. Let $\pi_k(G)$ denote the
number of $k$-cliques of $G$. For a function $w: V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2,
\dots\}$, let $G(w)$ be the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing each vertex
$v$ by a $w(v)$-clique $K^v$ and making each vertex of $K^u$ adjacent to each
vertex of $K^v$ for each edge $\{u,v\}$ of $G$. For an integer $m \geq 1$,
consider any $w$ with $\sum_{v \in V(G)} w(v) = m$. For $U \subseteq V(G)$, we
say that $w$ is uniform on $U$ if $w(v) = 0$ for each $v \in V(G) \setminus U$

V(B_n)\}$. He provided an affirmative answer for $k = 2$ (and any $G$). We
determine graphs for which the answer is negative for every $k \geq 3$. These
include $B_n$ for $n \geq 2$. Generalizing Sperner's Theorem and a recent
result of Qian, Engel and Xu, we show that $\pi_k(B_n(w))$ is smallest when $w$

be used to study signals from binaries in orbits of arbitrary shape and nature,
elliptical orbit results are applicable to systems with arbitrary
eccentricities. We also express the elliptical orbit results as leading

certain level of idleness. In call centers, this manifests itself as the call
avoidance behavior, where servers strategically adjust their service rate to
strike a balance between the idleness they receive and effort to work harder.
Moreover, being humans, each server values this trade-off differently and has
different capabilities. Drawing ideas on mean-field games we develop a novel
framework relying on measure-valued processes to simultaneously address
strategic server behavior and inherent server heterogeneity in service systems.
This framework enables us to extend the recent literature on strategic servers
in four new directions by: (i) incorporating individual choices of servers,
(ii) incorporating individual abilities of servers, (iii) modeling the
discomfort experienced by servers due to low levels of idleness, and (iv)
considering more general routing policies. Using our framework, we are able to
asymptotically characterize asymmetric Nash equilibria for many-server systems
with strategic servers.
  In simpler cases, it has been shown that the purely quality-driven regime is
asymptotically optimal. However, we show that if the discomfort increases fast
enough as the idleness approaches zero, the quality-and-efficiency-driven
regime and other quality driven regimes can be optimal. This is the first time
this conclusion appears in the literature.

followed by a theoretical analysis and an experimental validation linking the
inherent uncertainty to common loss functions for training CNNs, namely
cross-entropy and soft Dice. We find that, even though soft Dice optimization
leads to an improved performance with respect to the Dice score and other

analytics due to their small size and high query processing efficiency. In this
paper, we reformulate the loss minimization problem for summarization into an
equivalent integer maximization problem. By initially allowing relaxed
(fractional) solutions for integer maximization, we analytically expose the
underlying connections to the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix.
Consequently, we design an algorithm called SpecSumm that consists of two
phases. In the first phase, motivated by spectral graph theory, we apply
k-means clustering on the k largest (in magnitude) eigenvectors of the

of $n$ points in the $d$-dimensional decision space (or $m$ dimensional
objective space) to the scalar hypervolume indicator value. To define the
Hessian matrix, the input set is vectorized, and the matrix is derived by
analytical differentiation of the mapping from a vectorized set to the
hypervolume indicator. The Hessian matrix plays a crucial role in second-order
methods, such as the Newton-Raphson optimization method, and it can be used for
the verification of local optimal sets. So far, the full analytical expression
was only established and analyzed for the relatively simple bi-objective case.
This paper will derive the full expression for arbitrary dimensions ($m\geq2$
objective functions). For the practically important three-dimensional case, we
also provide an asymptotically efficient algorithm with time complexity in
$O(n\log n)$ for the exact computation of the Hessian Matrix' non-zero entries.
We establish a sharp bound of $12m-6$ for the number of non-zero entries. Also,
for the general $m$-dimensional case, a compact recursive analytical expression
is established, and its algorithmic implementation is discussed. Also, for the
general case, some sparsity results can be established; these results are
implied by the recursive expression. To validate and illustrate the
analytically derived algorithms and results, we provide a few numerical
examples using Python and Mathematica implementations. Open-source
implementations of the algorithms and testing data are made available as a
supplement to this paper.

the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented. The
analysis is based on $pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded from
2015 to 2018. Previous searches for diphoton resonances at the LHC have
explored masses down to 65 GeV, finding no evidence of new particles. This
search exploits the particular kinematics of events with pairs of closely
spaced photons reconstructed in the detector, allowing examination of invariant
masses down to 10 GeV. The presented strategy covers a region previously
unexplored at hadron colliders because of the experimental challenges of
recording low-energy photons and estimating the backgrounds. No significant
excess is observed and the reported limits provide the strongest bound on
promptly decaying axion-like particles coupling to gluons and photons for
masses between 10 and 70 GeV.

show that to maximize the system performance, it is necessary to choose a
proper active-IRS density given a fixed number of total reflecting elements,
which significantly differs from the passive-IRS case for which the centralized
IRS deployment scheme is better. Furthermore, the active-IRS aided wireless
network achieves higher spatial throughput than the passive-IRS counterpart

discarding process prevents DNNs from learning wrong associations between

atom selectivity (ability to individually address an atom) is only dependent on
the resultant phasor associated to the drives used to control the system. We
then exploit the benefits of such a drive-dependent selectivity to describe how
the coherent population inversion occurs in the atoms simultaneously, with no
interference of residual atom-atom interaction. In this scenario the parasitic
interaction works as a resource to fast and high fidelity control, as it gives
rise to a new regime of frequencies for the atoms able to suppress effective
atom-atom coupling (idling point). To end, we show how an entangling $i$SWAP

calculating observables in the semileptonic $D$ and $B$ meson decays and
confronting obtained results with experimental data. In general, the
predictions for the nonleptonic decay branching fractions are acceptable.
However, for a quantitative calculation it is necessary to account for a more

aged between 10 Myr to $\sim$ 1 Gyr with planetesimal belts. Gas in these
mature disks is thought to be released from planetesimals and has been modelled
using a viscous disk approach. At low densities, this may not be a good
assumption as the gas could be blown out by the stellar wind instead.
  Methods: We developed an analytical model for A to M stars that can follow
the evolution of gas outflows and target when the transition occurs between a
disk or a wind. The crucial criterion is the gas density for which gas
particles stop being protected from stellar wind protons impacting at high
velocities on radial trajectories.
  Results: We find that: 1) Belts of radial width $\Delta R$ with gas densities
$< 7 \, (\Delta R/50 {\rm \, au})^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ would create a wind rather
than a disk, which would explain the recent outflowing gas detection in NO Lup.
2) The properties of this belt wind can be used to measure stellar wind
properties such as their densities and velocities. 3) Debris disks with low
fractional luminosities $f$ are more likely to create gas winds, which could be
observed with current facilities.
  Conclusions: The systems containing low gas masses such as Fomalhaut or TWA 7
or more generally, debris disks with fractional luminosities $f \lesssim
10^{-5} (L_\star/L_\odot)^{-0.37} $ or stellar luminosity $\gtrsim 20 \,
L_\odot$ (A0V or earlier) would rather create gas outflows (or belt winds) than
gas disks. Gas observed to be outflowing at high velocity in the young system
NO Lup could be an example of such belt winds. The detection of these gas winds
is possible with ALMA (CO and CO$^+$ could be good wind tracers) and would
allow us to constrain the stellar wind properties of main-sequence stars, which
are otherwise difficult to measure.

protein binds to a regulatory sequence to increase or decrease RNA
transcription. However, transcription factors face two main challenges when
searching for these sequences. First, they are vanishingly short relative to
the genome length. Second, many nearly identical sequences are scattered across
the genome, causing proteins to suspend the search. But as pointed out in a
computational study of LacI regulation in Escherichia coli, such almost-targets
may lower search times if considering DNA looping. In this paper, we explore if
this also occurs over chromosome-wide distances. To this end, we developed a
cross-scale computational framework that combines established
facilitated-diffusion models for basepair-level search and a network model
capturing chromosome-wide leaps. To make our model realistic, we used Hi-C data
sets as a proxy for 3D proximity between long-ranged DNA segments and binding
profiles for more than 100 transcription factors. Using our cross-scale model,
we found that median search times to individual targets critically depend on a
network metric combining node strength (sum of link weights) and local
dissociation rates. Also, by randomizing these rates, we found that some actual
3D target configurations stand out as considerably faster or slower than their
random counterparts. This finding hints that chromosomes' 3D structure funnels
essential transcription factors to relevant DNA regions.

phenomena, according to both experimental and numerical data. In particular,
experimental field studies have highlighted the relation between phytoplankton
survival and turbulent upwelling and downwelling from thermal convection.
Recent numerical works have also shown the importance of accounting for
advective transport by persistent structures in simulation models. In
nutrient-rich polar marine environments phytoplankton blooms are critically
limited by light availability under ice-covered waters. Such heterogeneity of
the light intensity distribution, in association with a large-scale coherent
fluid flow, can give rise to nontrivial growth dynamics. In this work we extend
a previous advection-reaction-diffusion model of phytoplankton light-limited
vertical dynamics in the presence of convective transport. Specifically, we
consider horizontally heterogeneous light conditions through the use of two
regions with different production regimes, modelling the absence (presence) of
light under (in between) obstacles. Such a model is intended as an idealized
representation of nonuniformly ice-covered polar waters. By means of numerical
simulations, we find that the main role of advective transport is to hinder
phytoplankton growth, but also that such effect depends on the positions of the
obstacles with respect to the upwelling and downwelling flow regions.
Furthermore, we show that the sinking speed due to the density difference
between phytoplankton organisms and water, while small, plays an important
role, which depends on how it adds to the flow. These results indicate that
advective transport can have a crucial impact on the survival conditions of
sinking phytoplankton species in polar environments.

including the S&C phase and the communication-only phase, was presented to
maximize the throughput by jointly optimizing the IOS phase shifts and the
sensing duration. Then, we derive a closed-form expression of the achievable
rate which achieves a good approximation. Furthermore, a sufficient and

deliberately design a progressive feature alignment and selection module for
further improving the RefSR task. The newly proposed module aligns
reference-input images at multi-scale feature spaces and performs
reference-aware feature selection in a progressive manner, thus more precise
reference features can be transferred into the input features and the network
capability is enhanced. Our reciprocal learning paradigm is model-agnostic and
it can be applied to arbitrary RefSR models. We empirically show that multiple

popular. Smart plugs, smart lights, and smart switches are now found in as many

Moreover, parts of the distribution grid are only sparsely instrumented, which
leaves the distribution grid operator unaware of possible bottlenecks resulting
from the introduction of such loads and renewable generation. To overcome this
lack of information, we propose a grid monitoring that is based on measurements
of widely available smart home devices, such as smart plugs. In the present
paper, we illustrate the collection and utilization of smart plug measurements

  arbitrary base","29 pages",,,,"math.NT","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Mordechay B. Levin has constructed a number $\lambda$ which is normal in base
2, and such that the sequence $(\left\{2^n \lambda\right\})_{n=0,1,2,\ldots}$
has very small discrepancy $D_N$. Indeed we have $N\cdot D_N = \mathcal{O}
\left(\left(\log N\right)^2\right)$. This construction technique of Levin was
generalized by Becher and Carton, who generated normal numbers via perfect
nested necklaces, and they showed that for these normal numbers the same upper
discrepancy estimate holds as for the special example of Levin. In this paper
now we derive an upper discrepancy bound for so-called semi-perfect nested
necklaces and show that for the Levin's normal number in arbitrary prime base
$p$ this upper bound for the discrepancy is best possible, i.e., $N\cdot D_N
\geq c\left(\log N\right)^2$ with $c>0$ for infinitely many $N$. This result
generalizes a previous result where we ensured for the special example of Levin
for the base $p=2$, that $N\cdot D_N =O( \left(\log N\right)^2)$ is best
possible in $N$. So far it is known by a celebrated result of Schmidt that for
any sequence in $[0,1)$, $N\cdot D_N\geq c \log N$ with $c>0$ for infinitely
many $N$. So there is a gap of a $\log N$ factor in the question, what is the
best order for the discrepancy in $N$ that can be achieved for a normal number.
Our result for Levin's normal number in any prime base on the one hand might
support the guess that $O( \left(\log N\right)^2)$ is the best order in $N$
that can be achieved by a normal number, while generalizing the class of known
normal numbers by introducing e.g. semi-perfect necklaces on the other hand
might help for the search of normal numbers that satisfy smaller discrepancy
bounds in $N$ than $N\cdot D_N=O( \left(\log N\right)^2)$.

coheir Morley sequence in NATP theories.
  Following the strategy of Chernikov and Kaplan [8], we obtain some
corollaries which hold in NATP theories. Namely, (i) if a formula Kim-forks
over a model, then it quasi-divides over the same model, (ii) for any tuple of
parameters $b$ and a model $M$, there exists a global coheir $p$ containing
$\text{tp}(b/M)$ such that $B \ind^K_M b'$ for all $b'\models p|_{MB}$.
  We also show that for coheirs in NATP theories, condition (ii) above is a
necessary condition for being a witness of Kim-dividing, assuming that a
witness of Kim-dividing exists (see Definition 4.1 in this note). That is, if
we assume that a witness of Kim-dividing always exists over any given model,
then a coheir $p\supseteq \text{tp}(a/M)$ must satisfy (ii) whenever it is a
witness of Kim-dividing of $a$ over a model $M$. We also give a sufficient
condition for the existence of a witness of Kim-dividing in terms of
pre-independence relations.
  At the end of the paper, we leave a short remark on Mutchnik's recent work
[16]. We point out that the class of $\omega$-NDCTP$_2$ theories, a subclass of
the class of NATP theories, contains all NTP$_2$ theories and NSOP$_1$
theories. We also note that Kim-forking and Kim-dividing are equivalent over
models in $\omega$-NDCTP$_2$ theories, where Kim-dividing is defined with
respect to invariant Morley sequences, instead of coheir Morley sequences as in

Therefore, a specific hierarchy StyleGAN-based algorithm trained at distinct

novel clustered FL method called FPFC. Advancing from the standard ADMM, our
method is implemented in parallel, updates only a subset of devices at each

simultaneously preserving privacy, making it practical for FL. We also propose
a new warmup strategy for hyperparameter tuning under FL settings and consider
the asynchronous variant of FPFC (asyncFPFC). Theoretically, we provide
convergence guarantees of FPFC for general nonconvex losses and establish the
statistical convergence rate under a linear model with squared loss. Our

find that growth of the fracture depends on the ratio of the compliances of the

pressure needed to initiate a hydrofracture is found to be the same as that
derived by Griffith. Once a fracture initiates, for relatively low values of
the model parameter $\alpha_0$ ($\alpha_0 \leq 0.2$) the fracture advances
spontaneously to a new radius which depends on the value of $\alpha_0$. For
$\alpha_0 \leq 0.2$ further fluid injection is required to increase the
fracture radius after spontaneous growth stops. For the case where $\alpha_0 >

one of the eight independent equations will uncover the interrelation of the

impact the direction and curl of the angular momentum of fluid elements,
altering the frequencies of Karman vortex streets within the fluids. It means
that the external torque is interrelated with the velocity circulation, by

of simple liquids as a function of the amplitude of the imposed shear stress or
strain. The elastic mode theory (Ref. 6) is first generalized to take into
account the fact that during a flow experiment, mechanical energy is injected
in a system initially at thermodynamic equilibrium. This generalized theory can
be seen as a particular aspect of the general problem of perturbation by the
measurement, associated with that of the coupling between fluctuation and
dissipation. This generalization leads to a ""finitary"" character of the model.
It is then combined with the inertial mode theory (Ref. 7). The formalism thus
obtained allows to model the rheological behavior of liquids over a wide range
of velocity gradients, including the intermediate narrow range corresponding to
the Newtonian regime. As experimental tests, viscosity measurements with two
kinds of moving rotor rheometers were performed. Only data obtained with liquid
water at room temperature are presented and quantitatively analyzed here. It is
also shown that liquid n-octane exhibits the same qualitative behaviors as
those of liquid water. In the appendices, connection of this theory with

models for the team of robots and B\""uchi automata modeling the specification.
The approach in this paper consists in combining the two models into one,
denoted Composed Petri net and use it to find a sequence of action movements
for the mobile robots, providing collision free trajectories to fulfill the
specification. The solution results from a set of Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) problems. The main advantage of the proposed solution is the
completeness of the algorithm, meaning that a solution is found when exists,
this representing the key difference with our previous work in [1]. The
simulations illustrate comparison results between current and previous

perturbation series of the deflection angle in a general asymptotically-flat,
static, and spherical symmetric spacetime with the photon sphere. We apply our
formula to Schwarzschild black hole, Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole, and

hidden error terms in the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit on
the observables in a usual lens configuration with the photon sphere since the
hidden error terms are tiny. On the other hand, in a retro lensing
configuration, the deflection angle in the strong-deflection-limit analysis
have error of several percent and the 0th order of affine perturbation series
of the deflection angle has almost half of the error. Thus, in the retro
lensing configuration, we should use the 0th order of affine perturbation

Inadequate choices can result in vastly increased costs, without significantly

greatly reduced.
  Therefore, we present Ruya, a method for memory-aware optimization of data

samples of the dataset on just a single machine to model the job's memory usage
patterns. Second, we prioritize cluster configurations with a suitable amount

the best cluster configuration with Bayesian optimization. This search process
stops once it converges on a configuration that is believed to be optimal for

we see a reduction of search iterations to find an optimal configuration by

emerging fields of polaritonic chemistry and cavity materials engineering. The
use of rigorous first principles avoids ambiguities and problems stemming from
using approximate models based on phenomenological descriptions of light,
matter and their interactions. By starting from fundamental physical and
mathematical principles, we first review in great detail non-relativistic QED,
which allows to study polaritonic systems non-perturbatively by solving a
Schr\""odinger-type equation. The resulting Pauli-Fierz quantum field theory
serves as a cornerstone for the development of computational methods, such as
quantum-electrodynamical density functional theory, QED coupled cluster or
cavity Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. These methods treat light and
matter on equal footing and have the same level of accuracy and reliability as
established methods of computational chemistry and electronic structure theory.

explain their benefits for a better understanding of photon-induced changes of

methods we identify the open theoretical questions and how a so far missing
mechanistic understanding of polaritonic chemistry can be established. We
finally give an outlook on future directions within polaritonic chemistry and

These sources form two different complexes at a projected distance of $\sim$13
kpc, which are undergoing merging on an estimated timescale off 10-30 Myr. One
of the sources shows the presence of a broad H alpha emission line and is
classified as Type 1 AGN. This AGN is associated to an X-ray point-like source,
whose emission appears moderately obscured (with intrinsic absorption $N_{H}
\sim 10^{22} cm^{-2}$) and hosts a relatively massive black hole with mass
$M_{BH} \sim 10^{7} M_{\odot}$, which is accreting with an Eddington ratio of
$\sim$0.2. We conclude that the analyzed region is consistent with being the
formation site of a secondary BCG. These findings, together with an in-depth
analysis the X-ray morphology of the cluster, suggest a merging scenario of the
entire cluster, with two massive halos both harbouring two rapidly evolving
BCGs on the verge of being assembled. Our results are also consistent with the

rely on a message passing scheme which can become prohibitively expensive when
working with industrial-scale graphs. Inspired by the PPRGo model, we propose
the CorePPR model, a scalable solution that utilises a learnable convex
combination of the approximate personalised PageRank and the CoreRank to
diffuse multi-hop neighbourhood information in GNNs. Additionally, we
incorporate a dynamic mechanism to select the most influential neighbours for a

the model. Overall, we demonstrate that CorePPR outperforms PPRGo, particularly

around late-type stars are contaminated by stellar signals that are of the
order of a few meters per second in amplitude, even for the quietest stars.
Those signals are induced by acoustic oscillations, convective granulation
patterns, active regions co-rotating with the stellar surface, and magnetic
activity cycles. Aims. This study investigates the properties of all coherent
stellar signals seen on the Sun on timescales up to its sidereal rotational
period. By combining HARPS and HARPS-N solar data spanning several years, we
are able to clearly resolve signals on timescales from minutes to several
months. Methods. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mixture model to
determine the quality of the solar data based on the expected airmass-magnitude
extinction law. We then fit the velocity power spectrum of the cleaned and
heliocentric RVs with all known variability sources, to recreate the RV
contribution of each component. Results. After rejecting variations caused by
poor weather conditions, we are able to improve the average intra-day root mean
square (RMS) value by a factor of ~1.8. On sub-rotational timescales, we are
able to fully recreate the observed RMS of the RV variations. In order to also
include rotational components and their strong alias peaks introduced by
nightly sampling gaps, the alias powers are accounted for by being
redistributed to the central frequencies of the rotational harmonics.
Conclusions. In order to enable a better understanding and mitigation of
stellar activity sources, their respective impact on the total RV must be
well-measured and characterized. We are able to recreate RV components up to
rotational timescales, which can be further used to analyse the impact of each
individual source of stellar signals on the detectability of exoplanets.

chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The automatic food intake
monitoring system has the potential to improve the quality of life (QoF) of
people with dietary related diseases through dietary assessment. In this work,
we propose a novel contact-less radar-based food intake monitoring approach.
Specifically, a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor is
employed to recognize fine-grained eating and drinking gestures. The
fine-grained eating/drinking gesture contains a series of movement from raising
the hand to the mouth until putting away the hand from the mouth. A 3D temporal
convolutional network (3D-TCN) is developed to detect and segment eating and
drinking gestures in meal sessions by processing the Range-Doppler Cube (RD
Cube). Unlike previous radar-based research, this work collects data in
continuous meal sessions. We create a public dataset that contains 48 meal
sessions (3121 eating gestures and 608 drinking gestures) from 48 participants
with a total duration of 783 minutes. Four eating styles (fork & knife,
chopsticks, spoon, hand) are included in this dataset. To validate the
performance of the proposed approach, 8-fold cross validation method is
applied. Experimental results show that our proposed 3D-TCN outperforms the
model that combines a convolutional neural network and a long-short-term-memory
network (CNN-LSTM), and also the CNN-Bidirectional LSTM model (CNN-BiLSTM) in
eating and drinking gesture detection. The 3D-TCN model achieves a segmental
F1-score of 0.887 and 0.844 for eating and drinking gestures, respectively. The
results of the proposed approach indicate the feasibility of using radar for
fine-grained eating and drinking gesture detection and segmentation in meal
sessions.

by (1) investigating the efficiency of current fairness approaches through
surveying example methods for reducing unfair stereotypical bias from the

address this challenge, we propose MetaLoc, a fingerprinting-based localization
framework that leverages model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to achieve fast
adaptation to new environments with minimal human intervention. Implemented
using a deep neural network with strong representation capabilities, MetaLoc is
trained on historical data collected from well-calibrated environments to
optimize meta-parameters for fast adaptation. The framework includes two
paradigms for obtaining meta-parameters: the centralized paradigm, which
optimizes meta-parameters by sharing data from all historical environments with
simplicity, and the distributed paradigm, which preserves data privacy by
training environment-specific meta-parameters independently. Furthermore, the
advanced distributed paradigm modifies the vanilla MAML loss function to ensure
that the reduction of loss occurs in a consistent direction across various
training domains, thus facilitating faster convergence during training. Our
experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that MetaLoc
outperforms baseline methods in terms of localization accuracy, robustness, and
cost-effectiveness. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly

framework to measure the fungibility and anonymity of cryptocurrencies,
allowing us to quantitatively reason about the mixing characteristics of
cryptocurrencies and the privacy-enhancing technologies built on top of them.
Our methods apply absorbing Markov chains combined with Shannon entropy. To the

The prediction accuracy of the photometric redshift was significantly improved
owing to the large amount of information offered by the generated spectral
features learned from photometric data via the MML. A total of 415,930 quasars
from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 17, with redshifts between 1
and 5, were screened for our experiments. We used |{\Delta}z| =
|(z_phot-z_spec)/(1+z_spec)| to evaluate the redshift prediction and
demonstrated a 4.04% increase in accuracy. With the help of the generated
spectral features, the proportion of data with |{\Delta}z| < 0.1 can reach
84.45% of the total test samples, whereas it reaches 80.41% for single-modal
photometric data. Moreover, the Root Mean Square (RMS) of |{\Delta}z| is shown
to decreases from 0.1332 to 0.1235. Our method has the potential to be

cosmological parameters and study whether or not pairs of the data sets are

non-CMB data cosmological parameter constraints, which are large enough to rule
out the Planck $P(q)$ model at 3$\sigma$ but not the new $P(q)$ model. While
both P18 data and non-CMB data separately favor a closed geometry when
P18+non-CMB data are jointly analyzed the evidence in favor of non-flat
hypersurfaces subsides. Differences between P18 data and non-CMB data
cosmological constraints subside when $A_L$ is allowed to vary. From the most
restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data combination we get almost
model-independent constraints and find that the $A_L>1$ option is preferred
over the $\Omega_k<0$ one, with the $A_L$ parameter, for all models, being
larger than unity by $\sim 2.5\sigma$. According to the deviance information
criterion, in the P18+lensing+non-CMB analysis, the varying $A_L$ option is on

tamper with data intended for or produced by the legitimate user. In wireless
communication systems, these attacks may be detected by relying on features of
the channel and transmitter radios. In this context, a popular approach is to
exploit the dependence of the received signal strength (RSS) at multiple
receivers or access points with respect to the spatial location of the
transmitter. Existing schemes rely on long-term estimates, which makes it
difficult to distinguish spoofing from movement of a legitimate user. This
limitation is here addressed by means of a deep neural network that implicitly
learns the distribution of pairs of short-term RSS vector estimates. The
adopted network architecture imposes the invariance to permutations of the
input (commutativity) that the decision problem exhibits. The merits of the
proposed algorithm are corroborated on a data set that we collected.

real time is a difficult problem in robotics since its solution for a given
target pose is not unique. Moreover, choosing the optimal IK solution with
respect to application-specific demands helps to improve the robustness and to
increase the success rate when driving the manipulator from its current
configuration towards a desired pose. This is necessary, especially in
high-dynamic tasks like catching objects in mid-flights. To compute a suitable
target configuration in the joint space for a given target pose in the
trajectory planning context, various factors such as travel time or
manipulability must be considered. However, these factors increase the
complexity of the overall problem which impedes real-time implementation. In
this paper, a real-time framework to compute the analytical inverse kinematics
of a redundant robot is presented. To this end, the analytical IK of the
redundant manipulator is parameterized by so-called redundancy parameters,
which are combined with a target pose to yield a unique IK solution. Most
existing works in the literature either try to approximate the direct mapping
from the desired pose of the manipulator to the solution of the IK or cluster
the entire workspace to find IK solutions. In contrast, the proposed framework
directly learns these redundancy parameters by using a neural network (NN) that
provides the optimal IK solution with respect to the manipulability and the
closeness to the current robot configuration. Monte Carlo simulations show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach which is accurate and real-time capable

problems can be solved on bounded-treewidth graphs. For sets $\sigma,\rho$ of
non-negative integers, a $(\sigma,\rho)$-set of a graph $G$ is a set $S$ of
vertices such that $|N(u)\cap S|\in \sigma$ for every $u\in S$, and $|N(v)\cap
S|\in \rho$ for every $v\not\in S$. The problem of finding a
$(\sigma,\rho)$-set (of a certain size) unifies standard problems such as
Independent Set, Dominating Set, Independent Dominating Set, and many others.
  For all pairs of finite or cofinite sets $(\sigma,\rho)$, we determine (under
standard complexity assumptions) the best possible value $c_{\sigma,\rho}$ such
that there is an algorithm that counts $(\sigma,\rho)$-sets in time
$c_{\sigma,\rho}^{\sf tw}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ (if a tree decomposition of width
${\sf tw}$ is given in the input). For example, for the Exact Independent
Dominating Set problem (also known as Perfect Code) corresponding to
$\sigma=\{0\}$ and $\rho=\{1\}$, we improve the $3^{\sf tw}\cdot n^{O(1)}$
algorithm of [van Rooij, 2020] to $2^{\sf tw}\cdot n^{O(1)}$.
  Despite the unusually delicate definition of $c_{\sigma,\rho}$, we show that
our algorithms are most likely optimal, i.e., for any pair $(\sigma, \rho)$ of
finite or cofinite sets where the problem is non-trivial, and any
$\varepsilon>0$, a $(c_{\sigma,\rho}-\varepsilon)^{\sf tw}\cdot
n^{O(1)}$-algorithm counting the number of $(\sigma,\rho)$-sets would violate
the Counting Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (#SETH). For finite sets
$\sigma$ and $\rho$, our lower bounds also extend to the decision version,
showing that our algorithms are optimal in this setting as well. In contrast,
for many cofinite sets, we show that further significant improvements for the

probing the sociodemographic knowledge of different single-GPU PLMs on multiple
English data sets via traditional classifier probing and information-theoretic
minimum description length probing. Our results show that PLMs do encode these

evading a host of voracious aquatic and terrestrial predators. We discover that
semiaquatic springtails Isotomurus retardatus can perform directional jumps,
rapid aerial righting, and near-perfect landing on the water surface. They
achieve these locomotive controls by adjusting their body attitude and impulse
during takeoff, deforming their body in mid-air, and exploiting the
hydrophilicity of their ventral tube, known as collophore. Experiments and
mathematical modeling indicate that directional-impulse control during takeoff
is driven by the collophores adhesion force, the body angle, and the stroke
duration produced by their jumping organ, the furcula. In mid-air, springtails
curve their bodies to form a U-shape pose, which leverages aerodynamic forces
to right themselves in less than 20 ms, the fastest ever measured in animals. A
stable equilibrium is facilitated by the water adhered to the collophore.
Aerial righting was confirmed by placing springtails in a vertical wind tunnel
and through physical models. Due to these aerial responses, springtails land on
their ventral side 85% of the time while anchoring via the collophore on the
water surface to avoid bouncing. We validated the springtail biophysical
principles in a bioinspired jumping robot that reduces in-flight rotation and
lands upright 75% of the time. Thus, contrary to common belief, these wingless
hexapods can jump, skydive and land with outstanding control that can be
fundamental for survival.

many real-world networks contain modular structures of different sizes and
densities. In the networks where modular structures emerge due to coupling
between nodes with similar dynamical functions, we can identify them using
flow-based community detection methods. However, these methods implicitly
assume that communities are dense or clique-like which can shatter sparse
communities due to a field-of-view limit inherent in one-step dynamics. Taking
multiple steps with shorter or longer Markov time enables us to effectively
zoom in or out to capture small or long-range communities. However, zooming out
to avoid the field-of-view limit comes at the expense of introducing or
increasing a lower resolution limit. Here we relax the constant Markov time
constraint and introduce variable Markov dynamics as a multi-focal lens to
capture functional communities in networks with a higher range of scales. With
variable Markov time, a random walker can keep one-step dynamics in dense areas
to avoid the resolution limit and move faster in sparse areas to detect
long-range modular structures and prevent the field-of-view limit. We analyze
the performance of variable Markov time using the flow-based community
detection method called the map equation. We have implemented the map equation
with variable Markov time in the search algorithm Infomap without any
complexity overhead and tested its performance on synthetic and real-world

superconducting state of Sr2RuO4 by approaching a Lifshitz transition and
associated Van Hove singularity (VHS) in the density of states. At the VHS,
$T_c$ and the in- and out-of-plane upper critical fields are all strongly
enhanced, and the latter has changed its curvature as a function of temperature
from convex to concave. However, due to strain inhomogeneity it has not been
possible so far to determine how the upper critical fields change with strain.
Here, we show the strain dependence of both upper critical fields, which was
achieved due to an improved sample preparation. We find that the in-plane upper
critical field is mostly linear in $T_c$. On the other hand, the out-of-plane
upper critical field varies with a higher power in $T_c$, and peaks strongly at
the VHS. The strong increase in magnitude and the change in form of
$H_\mathrm{c2||c}$ occur very close to the Van Hove strain, and points to a
strong enhancement of both the density of states and the gap magnitude at the
Lifshitz transition.

conventional launchers cannot adequately assure. Rocket Factory Augsburg has
partnered with CEiiA for the development of several structures for the RFA One

light, and custom-made, applying design and manufacturing concepts as well as
technologies from other industries, like the aeronautical and automotive, to
the aerospace one. This allows for the implementation of a New Space approach
to the launcher segment, while also building a supply chain and a set of
solutions that enables the industrialisation of such structures for this and
future small launchers. The two main systems under development have been a
versatile Kick-Stage, for payload carrying and orbit insertion, and a sturdy
Payload Fairing. Even though the use of components off-the-shelf have been
widely accepted in the space industry for satellites, these two systems pose
different challenges as they must be: highly reliable during the most extreme

  Our results are twofold: We show that for non-negative matrices there is a

show decidability of $\omega$-regular temporal model checking against

the non-negative case encompasses the long-standing open Skolem and Positivity
problems.

Euler flows exhibiting blowup of primary (undifferentiated) flow variables: a
converging shock wave invades a quiescent region, and the velocity and pressure
in its immediate wake become unbounded at time of collapse. However, these
solutions are of border-line physicality: the pressure vanishes within the
quiescent region due to vanishing temperature there. It is reasonable that the
lack of upstream counter-pressure is conducive to large speeds, with
concomitant large amplitudes. Based on Guderley's original solutions it is
therefore unclear if it is the zero-pressure region that is responsible for
blowup. The same applies to self-similar Euler flows describing radial cavity
flow, first analyzed by Hunter (1960).
  Recent works have shown that the simplified isothermal and isentropic models
admit continuous blowup solutions in the presence of a strictly positive
pressure field. In this work we extend this conclusion to the case of the full
Euler system. The solutions under consideration are radial self-similar flows
in which a continuous wave focuses and blows up. We propagate the solutions
beyond blowup and observe numerically that there are cases where an expanding
spherical shock wave is generated at collapse. The resulting solution has the
unusual property that the flow is isentropic in each of the two regions
separated by the shock. We finally verify that these are admissible global weak
solutions to the full, multi-d compressible Euler system.

In this paper, we compare gradient-free optimization method based on the
cubature Kalman filter, model-free optimization and backpropagation for
end-to-end learning on a fiber-optic channel modeled by the split-step Fourier
method. The results indicate that the gradient-free optimization algorithms
provide a decent replacement to backpropagation in terms of performance at the
expense of computational complexity. Furthermore, the quantization problem of
finite bit resolution of the digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters
is addressed and its impact on geometrically shaped constellations is analysed.
Here, the results show that when optimizing a constellation with respect to
mutual information, a minimum number of quantization levels is required to
achieve shaping gain. For generalized mutual information, the gain is
maintained throughout all of the considered quantization levels. Also, the
results implied that the autoencoder can adapt the constellation size to the
given channel conditions.

algorithms to find such twin B-smooth integers that lie in a given interval by
using the structure of solutions of the above Pell equation. The problem of
finding such twin smooth integers is motivated by the quest for suitable

the Pell equation structure of twin B-smooth integers has previously been used
to describe and compute the full set of such pairs for very small values of B,
increasing B to allow for cryptographically sized solutions makes this approach
utterly infeasible. We start by revisiting the Pell solution structure of the
set of twin smooth integers. Instead of using it to enumerate all twin smooth
pairs, we focus on identifying only those that lie in a given interval. This
restriction allows us to describe algorithms that navigate the vast set of Pell
solutions in a more targeted way. Experiments run with these algorithms have
provided examples of twin B-smooth pairs that are larger and have smaller

Given an energy scale Lambda, expected to be close to the Planck scale m_Pl and
larger than the Hubble scale H, this noise is described in terms of a source
term in the evolution equation for comoving modes k which changes its amplitude
growth from early times as long as the mode physical wavelength is smaller than
Lambda^-1. We model the source term as due to a gas of black holes in the
trans--Planckian regime and the corresponding Hawking radiation. In fact, for
energy scales larger than, or of the order of Lambda, it is expected that
trapped surfaces may form due to large energy densities. At later times the
evolution then follows the standard sourceless evolution. We find that this
mechanism still leads to a scale-invariant power spectrum of tensor
perturbations, with an amplitude that depends upon the ratio Lambda/m_Pl.

bipartitions or splits of $X$ which contains all splits of the form
$\{x,X-\{x\}\}$, $x \in X$. To any such split system $\mathcal S$ we can
associate the Buneman graph $\mathcal B(\mathcal S)$ which is essentially a
median graph with leaf-set $X$ that displays the splits in $\mathcal S$. In
this paper, we consider properties of injective split systems, that is, split
systems $\mathcal S$ with the property that $\mathrm{med}_{\mathcal B(\mathcal

in $X$, where $\mathrm {med}_{\mathcal B(\mathcal S)}(Y)$ denotes the median in
$\mathcal B(\mathcal S)$ of the three elements in $Y$ considered as leaves in
$\mathcal B(\mathcal S)$. In particular, we show that for any set $X$ there
always exists an injective split system on $X$, and we also give a
characterization for when a split system is injective. We also consider how
complex the Buneman graph $\mathcal B(\mathcal S)$ needs to become in order for
a split system $\mathcal S$ on $X$ to be injective. We do this by introducing a
quantity for $|X|$ which we call the injective dimension for $|X|$, as well as
two related quantities, called the injective 2-split and the rooted-injective
dimension. We derive some upper and lower bounds for all three of these
dimensions and also prove that some of these bounds are tight. An underlying
motivation for studying injective split systems is that they can be used to
obtain a natural generalization of symbolic tree maps. An important consequence
of our results is that any three-way symbolic map on $X$ can be represented
using Buneman graphs.

potential of this kind of analyses. We thus develop two numerical methods to
describe the clustering of cosmic voids. Neither model requires additional
cosmological information beyond that assumed within the galaxy de-wiggled
model. The models consist in power spectra whose performance we assess in
comparison to a parabolic model on Patchy cubic and light-cone mocks. Moreover,
we test their robustness against systematic effects and the reconstruction
technique. The void model power spectra and the parabolic model with a fixed
parameter provide strongly correlated values for the Alcock-Paczynski
($\alpha$) parameter, for boxes and light-cones likewise. The resulting
$\alpha$ values -- for all three models -- are unbiased and their uncertainties
are correctly estimated. However, the numerical models show less variation with
the fitting range compared to the parabolic one. The Bayesian evidence suggests
that the numerical techniques are often favoured compared to the parabolic
model. Moreover, the void model power spectra computed on boxes can describe
the void clustering from light-cones as well as from boxes. The same void model
power spectra can be used for the study of pre- and post-reconstructed
data-sets. Lastly, the two numerical techniques are resilient against the
studied systematic effects. Consequently, using either of the two new void
models, one can more robustly measure cosmological parameters.

dynamics using the Matsubara approximation that removes the high frequency
nuclear normal modes in the TCF and derive the SM-NRPMD approach from the
non-adiabatic Matsubara dynamics by discarding the imaginary part of the
Liouvillian. The SM-NRPMD method has numerical advantages compared to the
original NRPMD method based on the MMST mapping formalism, due to a more
natural mapping using the SU(N) Lie Group that preserves the symmetry of the

in understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. One of the major
challenges of constraining the IFMR is the difficulty of measuring the mass of
non-luminous remnant objects (i.e. neutron stars and black holes).
Gravitational wave detectors have opened the possibility of finding large
numbers of compact objects in other galaxies, but all in merging binary
systems. Gravitational lensing experiments using astrometry and photometry are
capable of finding compact objects, both isolated and in binaries, in the Milky
Way. In this work we improve the PopSyCLE microlensing simulation code in order
to explore the possibility of constraining the IFMR using the Milky Way
microlensing population. We predict that the Roman Space Telescope's
microlensing survey will likely be able to distinguish different IFMRs based on
the differences at the long end of the Einstein crossing time distribution and
the small end of the microlensing parallax distribution, assuming the small
($\pi_E \lesssim 0.02$) microlensing parallaxes characteristic of black hole
lenses are able to be measured accurately. We emphasize that future
microlensing surveys need to be capable of characterizing events with small
microlensing parallaxes in order to place the most meaningful constraints on
the IFMR.

the proposed method has the following merits: (1) our model is an end-to-end

via view-specific autoencoders and cluster-level data aligning by combining
multi-view information with the cross-view graph contrastive learning; (2) it
is easy to apply our model to explore information from three or more

Secondly, we move forward from the elastic spin to revisit the phonon spin

modes, surface phonon modes, and hybridized phonon modes, regarded as a

from the local rotating of the field polarization in time domain, not the local

consistent models and consistent dynamic boundary conditions hierarchically
following the generalized Onsager principle. The method consists of two steps
in tandem: the dynamical equation is determined by the generalized Onsager
principle in the bulk firstly, and then the surface chemical potential and the
thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions are formulated subsequently by
applying the generalized Onsager principle at the boundary. The application
strategy of the generalized Onsager principle in two-step yields
thermodynamically consistent models together with the consistent boundary
conditions that warrant a non-negative entropy production rate (or equivalently
non-positive energy dissipation rate in isothermal cases) in the bulk as well
as at the boundary. We illustrate the method using phase field models of binary
materials elaborate on two sets of thermodynamically consistent dynamic
boundary conditions. These two types of boundary conditions differ in how the
across boundary mass flux participates in boundary surface dynamics. We then
show that many existing thermodynamically consistent, binary phase field models
together with their dynamic or static boundary conditions are derivable from
this method. As an illustration, we show numerically how dynamic boundary
conditions affect crystal growth in the bulk using a binary phase field model.

Test facility (NBTF) at Consorzio RFX (Padova, Italy) to prove the possibility
of generating up to 40 A of negative ions, with a maximum extracted current
density of 350 A/m2 (H)/285 A/m2 (D) and a fraction of co-extracted electrons
not greater than 0.5 (H)/1 (D). These performances are required for the
realization of the ITER Neutral Beam Injector (NBI), which should deliver 16.7
MW to the plasma by means of negative ions accelerated up to 1 MeV and
neutralized before being injected into the ITER tokamak. In order to obtain
such high extracted current densities and low co-extracted electron fractions
it is necessary to lower the work function of the surface of the acceleration
system grid facing the source; this will be accomplished by coating the
surfaces with Cs, routinely evaporated by three ovens. The functionality of the
ovens has been tested at the CAesium oven Test Stand (CATS), hosted at NBTF.
The test stand is equipped with several diagnostics, among which a Laser
Absorption Spectroscopy (LAS) diagnostic. Using a tunable laser diode, the LAS
diagnostic gets the high resolution absorption spectrum of the Cs 852 nm D2
line along a line of sight to measure Cs density at ground state. The paper
describes the test stand and the LAS diagnostic, together with the
characterization of the ovens to be installed in SPIDER. The paper will also
study the systematic density underestimation effect caused by Cs ground state
depopulation, as a function of laser intensity and of Cs density, in the
perspective of correcting the density evaluation.

increased rapidly. Device-free human detection through sensors or cameras has
been widely adopted, but it comes with privacy issues as well as misdetection
for motionless people. To address these drawbacks, channel state information
(CSI) captured from commercialized Wi-Fi devices provides rich signal features
for accurate detection. However, existing systems suffer from inaccurate
classification under a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and stationary scenario, such
as when a person is standing still in a room corner. In this work, we propose a
system called CRONOS (Colorization and Contrastive Learning Enhanced NLoS Human
Presence Detection), which generates dynamic recurrence plots (RPs) and
color-coded CSI ratios to distinguish mobile and stationary people from vacancy
in a room, respectively. We also incorporate supervised contrastive learning to
retrieve substantial representations, where consultation loss is formulated to
differentiate the representative distances between dynamic and stationary
cases. Furthermore, we propose a self-switched static feature enhanced
classifier (S3FEC) to determine the utilization of either RPs or color-coded
CSI ratios. Our comprehensive experimental results show that CRONOS outperforms
existing systems that either apply machine learning or non-learning based
methods, as well as non-CSI based features in open literature. CRONOS achieves
the highest human presence detection accuracy in vacancy, mobility,
line-of-sight (LoS), and NLoS scenarios.

design an adaptive fraudster detection module that explicitly considers label

called as the upper-crossing/solution (US) algorithm, which belongs to the
category of non-bracketing (or open domain) methods. The US algorithm is a
general principle for iteratively seeking the unique root $\theta^{*}$ of a
non-linear equation $g(\theta)=0$ and its each iteration consists of two steps:
an upper-crossing step (U-step) and a solution step (S-step), where the U-step
finds an upper-crossing function or a $U$-function $U(\theta|\theta^{(t)})$
[whose form depends on $\theta^{(t)}$ being the $t$-th iteration of
$\theta^{*}$] based on a new notion of so-called changing direction inequality,
and the S-step solves the simple $U$-equation $U(\theta|\theta^{(t)}) =0$ to
obtain its explicit solution $\theta^{(t+1)}$. The US algorithm holds two major
advantages: (i) It strongly stably converges to the root $\theta^{*}$; and (ii)
it does not depend on any initial values, in contrast to Newton's method. The
key step for applying the US algorithm is to construct one simple $U$-function
$U(\theta|\theta^{(t)})$ such that an explicit solution to the $U$-equation
$U(\theta|\theta^{(t)}) =0$ is available. Based on the first-, second- and
third-derivative of $g(\theta)$, three methods are given for constructing such
$U$-functions. We show various applications of the US algorithm in such as
calculating quantile in continuous distributions, calculating exact $p$-values
for skew null distributions, and finding maximum likelihood estimates of
parameters in a class of continuous/discrete distributions. The analysis of the
convergence rate of the US algorithm and some numerical experiments are also
provided. Especially, because of the property of strongly stable convergence,
the US algorithm could be one of the powerful tools for solving an equation

  and Network Security 2022. CNS. Austin, TX, USA",,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reverse engineering of undocumented protocols is a common task in security
analyses of networked services. The communication itself, captured in traffic
traces, contains much of the necessary information to perform such a protocol
reverse engineering. The comprehension of the format of unknown messages is of
particular interest for binary protocols that are not human-readable. One major
challenge is to discover probable fields in a message as the basis for further
analyses. Given a set of messages, split into segments of bytes by an existing
segmenter, we propose a method to refine the approximation of the field
inference. We use principle component analysis (PCA) to discover linearly
correlated variance between sets of message segments. We relocate the
boundaries of the initial coarse segmentation to more accurately match with the
true fields. We perform different evaluations of our method to show its benefit
for the message format inference and subsequent analysis tasks from literature
that depend on the message format. We can achieve a median improvement of the
message format accuracy across different real-world protocols by up to 100 %.

introducing new concepts of mixed volume measure and Orlicz multiple mixed
volume measure, and using the Orlicz-Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality. The Orlicz
log-Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality in special cases yield the classical
Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality and Orlicz log-Minkowski type inequality,
