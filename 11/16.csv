star-forming galaxies at $5.33 < z < 6.93$ detected in JWST/NIRCam 3.5$\mu$m
slitless spectroscopy of a $6.5 \times 3.4$ arcmin$^2$ field centered on the
hyperluminous quasar SDSS J0100+2802, obtained as part of the EIGER
(Emission-line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization)
survey. Three prominent galaxy overdensities are observed, one of them at the
redshift of the quasar. Galaxies are found within 200 pkpc and 105 km s$^{-1}$
of four known metal absorption-line systems in this redshift range. We focus on
the role of the galaxies in ionizing the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM)
during the later stages of cosmic reionization and construct the mean
Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ transmission as a function of distance from the
galaxies. At the lowest redshifts in our study, $5.3 < z < 5.7$, the IGM
transmission rises monotonically with distance from the galaxies. This is as
expected when galaxies reside at peaks in the overdensity field of an IGM that
is ionized by more or less uniform ionizing background, and has been seen at
lower redshifts. In contrast, at $5.7 < z < 6.14$, the transmission of both
Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ first increases with distance, but then peaks at a
distance of 5 cMpc before declining. This peak in transmission is qualitatively
similar to that seen (albeit at smaller distances and higher redshifts) in the
THESAN simulations. Finally, in the region $6.15 < z < 6.26$ where the
additional ionizing radiation from the quasar dominates, the monotonic increase
in transmission with distance is re-established. This result is interpreted to
represent evidence that the transmission of the IGM at $z \sim 5.9$ towards
J0100+2802 results from the ``local'' ionizing radiation of galaxies that
dominates over the much reduced cosmic background.

Angstrom (up to 3000 Angstrom), young ages (~100 Myr), a highly excited
interstellar medium ([OIII]/H$\beta\approx6$) and low dust attenuations. These
high EWs are very rare in the local Universe, but we show they are ubiquitous
at $z\sim6$ based on the measured number densities. The stacked spectrum
reveals H$\gamma$ and [OIII]$_{4364}$ which shows that the galaxies are
typically dust and metal poor (E(B-V)=0.1, 12+log(O/H)=7.4) with a high
electron temperature ($2\times10^4$ K) and a production efficiency of ionising
photons ($\xi_{\rm ion}=10^{25.3}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$). We further show the
existence of a strong mass-metallicity relation. The young highly ionising
stellar populations, moderately low metallicities, low dust attenuations and
high ionisation state in z~6 galaxies conspire to maximise the [OIII] output
from galaxies, yielding an [OIII] luminosity density at z~6 that is
significantly higher than at z~2, despite the order of magnitude decline in
cosmic star formation. Thus, [OIII] emission-line surveys with JWST prove a
highly efficient method to trace the galaxy density in the epoch of

Our fundamental understanding of grain boundaries is still incomplete even

Here, we present a systematic study, over 9 orders of magnitude of size scales,
in which we analyze 2D defects between two neighboring crystals across five
hierarchy levels and investigate their crystallographic, compositional, and
electronic features. The levels are (a) the macroscale interface alignment and
grain misorientation (held constant here); (b) the systematic mesoscopic change
in the inclination of the grain boundary plane for the same orientation
difference; (c) the facets, atomic motifs (structural units), and internal
nanoscopic defects within the boundary plane; (d) the grain boundary chemistry;
and (e) the electronic structure of the atomic motifs. As a model material, we
use Fe alloyed with B and C, exploiting the strong interdependence of interface
structure and chemistry in this system. This model system is the basis of the
1.9 billion tons of steel produced annually and has an eminent role as a
catalyst. Surprisingly, we find that even a change in the inclination of the GB
plane with identical misorientation impacts GB composition and atomic
arrangement. Thus, it is the smallest structural hierarchical level, the atomic
motifs, which control the most important chemical properties of the grain
boundaries. This finding not only closes a missing link between the structure
and chemical composition of such defects but also enables the targeted design
and passivation of the chemical state of grain boundaries to free them from
their role as entry gates for corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, or mechanical

SOT switching studies reveal an incubation delay in the ~ns range due to
stochasticity in the nucleation of a magnetic domain during reversal. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate ultrafast SOT-induced magnetization switching
dynamics of a ferromagnet with no incubation delay by avoiding the nucleation
process and driving the magnetization coherently. We employ an ultrafast
photo-conducting switch and a co-planar strip line to generate and guide ~ps
current pulses into the heavy metal/ferromagnet layer stack and induce
ultrafast SOT. We use magneto-optical probing to investigate the magnetization
switching dynamics with sub-picosecond time resolution. Depending on the
relative current pulse and in-plane magnetic field polarities, we observe
either an ultrafast demagnetization and subsequent recovery along with a
SOT-induced precessional oscillation, or ultrafast SOT switching. The
magnetization zero-crossing occurs in ~70 ps, which is approximately an order
of magnitude faster than previous studies. Complete switching needs ~250 ps and
is limited by the heat diffusion to the substrate. We use a macro-magnetic
simulation coupled with an ultrafast heating model to analyze the effect of
ultrafast thermal anisotropy torque and current-induced torque in the observed
dynamics. Good agreement between our experimental results and the macro-spin
model shows that the switching dynamics are coherent and present no noticeable
incubation delay. Our work suggests a potential pathway toward dramatically
increasing the writing speed of SOT magnetic random-access memory devices.

  In this paper, we propose Reads2Vec, an alignment-free embedding approach
that can generate a fixed-length feature vector representation directly from
the raw sequencing reads without requiring assembly. Furthermore, since such an
embedding is a numerical representation, it may be applied to highly optimized
classification and clustering algorithms. Experiments on simulated data show
that our proposed embedding obtains better classification results and better
clustering properties contrary to existing alignment-free baselines. In a study
on real data, we show that alignment-free embeddings have better clustering
properties than the Pangolin tool and that the spike region of the SARS-CoV-2

environment representation now contains an additional layer for cells occupied
by dynamic objects. Earlier solutions could only distinguish between free and
occupied cells. The information whether an obstacle could move plays an
important role for planning the behavior of an AV. We present two approaches to
generating training data. One approach extends our previous work on using
synthetic training data so that OGMs with the three aforementioned cell states
are generated. The other approach uses manual annotations from the nuScenes
dataset to create training data. We compare the performance of both models in a
quantitative analysis on unseen data from the real-world dataset. Next, we
analyze the ability of both approaches to cope with a domain shift, i.e. when
presented with lidar measurements from a different sensor on a different
vehicle. We propose using information gained from evaluation on real-world data
to further close the reality gap and create better synthetic data that can be
used to train occupancy grid mapping models for arbitrary sensor

characterize individual-specific facial movements. We present a novel training

self-supervised Person-Specific Models (PSMs), in which one model per
individual can learn to extract an embedding of the facial movements
independently of the person's identity and other structural facial
characteristics from unlabeled facial video. These models are trained using
encoder-decoder-like architectures. We provide quantitative and qualitative
evidence that a PSM learns a meaningful facial embedding that discovers
fine-grained movements otherwise not characterized by a General Model (GM),
which is trained across individuals and characterizes general patterns of
facial movements. We present quantitative and qualitative evidence that this
approach is easily scalable and generalizable for new individuals: facial
movements knowledge learned on a person can quickly and effectively be
transferred to a new person. Lastly, we propose a novel PSM using curriculum
temporal learning to leverage the temporal contiguity between video frames. Our
code, analysis details, and all pretrained models are available in Github and

graph $G=(V,E)$ whose vertices are colored either red or blue, and we want to
select a (small) subset $S \subseteq V$, called red-blue separating set, such
that for every red-blue pair of vertices, there is a vertex $s \in S$ whose
closed neighborhood contains exactly one of the two vertices of the pair. We
study the computational complexity of Red-Blue Separation, in which one asks
whether a given red-blue colored graph has a red-blue separating set of size at
most a given integer. We prove that the problem is NP-complete even for
restricted graph classes. We also show that it is always approximable in
polynomial time within a factor of $2\ln n$, where $n$ is the input graph's
order. In contrast, for triangle-free graphs and for graphs of bounded maximum
degree, we show that Red-Blue Separation is solvable in polynomial time when
the size of the smaller color class is bounded by a constant. However, on
general graphs, we show that the problem is $W[2]$-hard even when parameterized
by the solution size plus the size of the smaller color class. We also consider
the problem Max Red-Blue Separation where the coloring is not part of the
input. Here, given an input graph $G$, we want to determine the smallest
integer $k$ such that, for every possible red-blue coloring of $G$, there is a
red-blue separating set of size at most $k$. We derive tight bounds on the
cardinality of an optimal solution of Max Red-Blue Separation, showing that it
can range from logarithmic in the graph order, up to the order minus one. We
also give bounds with respect to related parameters. For trees however we prove
an upper bound of two-thirds the order. We then show that Max Red-Blue
Separation is NP-hard, even for graphs of bounded maximum degree, but can be
approximated in polynomial time within a factor of $O(\ln^2 n)$.

Lyapunov exponent and Hurst exponent to assess the meaningful stability of
these signals (lack of chaos). By utilizing the probability density function

(CMUDRN) model targeting the task of unified deraining and desnowing in a

Recursive Network (DRN) architecture developed by Cai et al. The proposed model
makes use of cross-stitch units that enable multi-task learning across two
separate DRN models, each tasked for single image deraining and desnowing,
respectively. By fixing cross-stitch units at several layers of basic
task-specific DRN networks, we perform multi-task learning over the two
separate DRN models. To enable blind image restoration, on top of these
structures we employ a simple neural fusion scheme which merges the output of
each DRN. The separate task-specific DRN models and the fusion scheme are
simultaneously trained by enforcing local and global supervision. Local
supervision is applied on the two DRN submodules, and global supervision is
applied on the data fusion submodule of the proposed model. Consequently, we
both enable feature sharing across task-specific DRN models and control the
image restoration behavior of the DRN submodules. An ablation study shows the
strength of the hypothesized CMUDRN model, and experiments indicate that its
performance is comparable or better than baseline DRN models on the single
image deraining and desnowing tasks. Moreover, CMUDRN enables blind image
restoration for the two underlying image restoration tasks, by unifying
task-specific image restoration pipelines via a naive parametric fusion scheme.

sub-levels, and is quenched back to the singlet state by an inelastic collision
with a H$_2$ molecule. The resulting increase of kinetic energy after this
cycle modifies the $\mu$p atom diffusion in the hydrogen gas and the arrival
time of the $\mu$p atoms at the target walls. This laser-induced modification
of the arrival times is used to expose the atomic transition. In this paper we
present the simulation of the $\mu$p diffusion in the H$_2$ gas which is at the
core of the experimental scheme. These simulations have been implemented with
the Geant4 framework by introducing various low-energy processes including the
motion of the H$_2$ molecules, i.e. the effects related with the hydrogen
target temperature. The simulations have been used to optimize the hydrogen
target parameters (pressure, temperatures and thickness) and to estimate signal
and background rates. These rates allow to estimate the maximum time needed to
find the resonance and the statistical accuracy of the spectroscopy experiment.

loss function for single-channel reverberant speech separation. Prior methods
for unsupervised separation required the synthesis of mixtures of mixtures or
assumed the existence of a teacher model, making them difficult to consider as
potential methods explaining the emergence of separation abilities in an
animal's auditory system. We assume the availability of two-channel mixtures at
training time, and train a neural network to separate the sources given one of
the channels as input such that the other channel may be predicted from the
separated sources. As the relationship between the room impulse responses
(RIRs) of each channel depends on the locations of the sources, which are
unknown to the network, the network cannot rely on learning that relationship.
Instead, our proposed loss function fits each of the separated sources to the
mixture in the target channel via Wiener filtering, and compares the resulting
mixture to the ground-truth one. We show that minimizing the scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) of the predicted right-channel mixture with
respect to the ground truth implicitly guides the network towards separating
the left-channel sources. On a semi-supervised reverberant speech separation
task based on the WHAMR! dataset, using training data where just 5% (resp.,
10%) of the mixtures are labeled with associated isolated sources, we achieve
70% (resp., 78%) of the SI-SDR improvement obtained when training with
supervision on the full training set, while a model trained only on the labeled

extend previous works and present the PARTNR algorithm that can detect
ambiguities in the trained policy by analyzing multiple modalities in the pick

sensitivity-based, gating function that decides if additional user
demonstrations are required. User demonstrations are aggregated to the dataset

domain shift and it can minimize the number of required demonstrations for a
well-trained policy. The adaptive threshold enables to achieve the

the dissipation of gas in the protoplanetary disk, after which the damping

  multi-scattering environment",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The data-driven reduced order models (ROMs) have recently emerged as an
efficient tool for the solution of the inverse scattering problems with
applications to seismic and sonar imaging. One specification of this approach
is that it requires the full square multiple-output/multiple-input (MIMO)
matrix valued transfer function as data for multidimensional problems. The
synthetic aperture radar (SAR), however, is limited to single input/single
output (SISO) measurements corresponding to the diagonal of the matrix transfer
function. Here we present a ROM based Lippmann-Schwinger approach overcoming
this drawback. The ROMs are constructed to match the data for each
source-receiver pair separately, and these are used to construct internal
solutions for the corresponding source using only the data-driven Gramian.
Efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated on 2D and 2.5D (3D
propagation and 2D reflectors) numerical examples. The new algorithm not only
suppresses multiple echoes seen in the Born imaging, but also takes advantage
of illumination by them of some back sides of the reflectors, improving the
quality of their mapping.

symbolically encoded domain description. While powerful in well-defined
scenarios, setting this up requires substantial effort. Different from this,
most everyday planning tasks are solved by humans intuitively, using mental
imagery of the different planning steps. Here we suggest that the same approach
can be used for robots, too, in cases which require only limited execution
accuracy. In the current study, we propose a novel sub-symbolic method called
Simulated Mental Imagery for Planning (SiMIP), which consists of several steps:
perception, simulated action, success-checking and re-planning performed on
'imagined' images. We show that it is possible this way to implement mental
imagery-based planning in an algorithmically sound way by combining regular
convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks. With this
method, the robot acquires the capability to use the initially existing scene
to generate action plans without symbolic domain descriptions, hence, without
the need to define an explicit representation of the environment. We create a
dataset from real scenes for a packing problem of having to correctly place
different objects into different target slots. This way efficiency and success
rate of this algorithm could be quantified.

latent interfering sources outside the known network, whose power allocation
policy is hidden from and uncontrollable to optimization. The paper extends the
famous alternate optimization algorithm weighted minimum mean square error
(WMMSE) [1] under a causal inference framework to tackle with WSRM.
Specifically, with the possibility of power policy shifting in the hidden
network, computing an iterating direction based only on the observed
interference inherently implies that counterfactual is ignored in decision
making. A method called synthetic control (SC) is used to estimate the
counterfactual. For any link in the known network, SC constructs a convex
combination of the interference on other links and uses it as an estimate for
the counterfactual. Power iteration in the proposed SC-WMMSE is performed
taking into account both the observed interference and its counterfactual.
SC-WMMSE requires no more information than the original WMMSE in the
optimization stage. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper explores the
potential of SC in assisting mathematical optimization in addressing classic
wireless optimization problems. Numerical results suggest the superiority of
the SC-WMMSE over the original in both convergence and objective.

``streaming'' due to inertial rectification, which has been used in a host of

dimensions. Utilizing inertial lubrication theory, we demonstrate that the
time-averaged streaming flow has a three-dimensional structure. Notably, the
flow changes direction across the depth of the channel, which is a feature not
observed in less confined streaming setups. This feature is confirmed by our
experiments of streaming around a cylinder sandwiched in a microchannel. Our
theory also predicts that the streaming velocity decays as the inverse cube of
the distance from the cylinder, faster than that expected from previous

phenomena due to the interaction between light and spacetime curvature. In my
dissertation, I present {\tt BiGONLight}, a {\tt Mathematica} package that
applies the BGO formalism to study light propagation in numerical relativity.
The package encodes the 3+1 bilocal geodesic operators framework as a
collection of {\tt Mathematica} functions. The inputs are the spacetime metric
plus the kinematics of the observer and the source in the form of the 3+1
quantities, which may come directly from a numerical simulation or can be
provided by the user as analytical components. These data are then used for ray
tracing and computing the BGOs in a completely general way, i.e. without
relying on symmetries or specific coordinate choices. The primary purpose of
the package is the computation of optical observables in arbitrary spacetimes.
The uniform theoretical framework of the BGO formalism allows for the
extraction of multiple observables within a single computation, while the {\tt
Wolfram} language provides a flexible computational framework that makes the
package highly adaptable to perform both numerical and analytical studies of
light propagation.

processes, i.e. the Drell-Yan production in $pp$ collisions, semi-inclusive
deep-inelastic scattering, and back-to-back two hadron production in $e^+e^-$
collisions. In the end, we present the numerical predictions for different
threshold-TMD functions and also transverse momentum distributions at $pp$,
$ep$, and $e^+e^-$ collisions.

space at a statistically stationary regime. From a dynamical systems point of
view, this portion is the attractor. The knowledge of the turbulent attractor
is useful for two purposes, at least: (i) We can gain physical insight into
turbulence (what is the shape and geometry of the attractor?), and (ii) it
provides the minimal number of degrees of freedom to accurately describe the
turbulent dynamics. Autoencoders enable the computation of an optimal latent
space, which is a low-order representation of the dynamics. If properly trained
and correctly designed, autoencoders can learn an approximation of the
turbulent attractor, as shown by Doan, Racca and Magri (2022). In this paper,
we theoretically interpret the transformations of an autoencoder. First, we
remark that the latent space is a curved manifold with curvilinear coordinates,
which can be analyzed with simple tools from Riemann geometry. Second, we
characterize the geometrical properties of the latent space. We mathematically
derive the metric tensor, which provides a mathematical description of the
manifold. Third, we propose a method -- proper latent decomposition (PLD) --
that generalizes proper orthogonal decomposition of turbulent flows on the
autoencoder latent space. This decomposition finds the dominant directions in
the curved latent space. This theoretical work opens up computational
opportunities for interpreting autoencoders and creating reduced-order models

interface of convective and radiative regions within stellar interiors, such as
the convective core or sub-surface convection zones. We aim to compare the
properties of SLF variability in massive main-sequence stars observed by the
TESS mission determined by different statistical methods, and confirm the
correlation between the morphology of SLF variability and a star's location in
the HR diagram. From a sample of 30 massive stars observed by TESS, we compare
the resultant parameters of SLF variability, in particular the characteristic
frequency, obtained from fitting the amplitude spectrum of the light curve with
those inferred from fitting the covariance structure of the light curve using
the celerite2 Gaussian process (GP) regression software and a damped SHO
kernel. We find a difference in the characteristic frequency obtained from the
amplitude spectrum fitting and from fitting the co-variance structure of the
light curve using a GP regression with celerite2 for only a minority of the
considered sample. However, the trends among mass, age and the properties of
SLF variability previously reported remain unaffected. GP regression is a
useful and novel methodology to efficiently characterise SLF variability in
massive stars compared to previous techniques used in the literature. We
conclude that the correlation between a star's SLF variability, in particular
the characteristic frequency, and its location in the HR diagram is robust for
main-sequence massive stars. There also exists a distribution in the
stochasticity of SLF variability in massive stars, which indicates that the
coherency of SLF variability is also a function of mass and age in massive
stars.

hyperspectral image classification, which aims to predict the category of each
pixel for an image captured by hyperspectral sensors. The core problem for
hyperspectral image classification is the spectral variability between
intraclass materials and the spectral similarity between interclass materials,
motivating the further incorporation of spatial information to differentiate a
pixel based on its surrounding patch. However, different pixels and even the
same pixel in one patch might not encode the same material due to the low
spatial resolution of most hyperspectral sensors, leading to an inconsistent
judgment of a specific pixel. To address this issue, we propose a probabilistic
deep metric learning framework to model the categorical uncertainty of the
spectral distribution of an observed pixel. We propose to learn a global
probabilistic distribution for each pixel in the patch and a probabilistic
metric to model the distance between distributions. We treat each pixel in a
patch as a training sample, enabling us to exploit more information from the
patch compared with conventional methods. Our framework can be readily applied
to existing hyperspectral image classification methods with various network
architectures and loss functions. Extensive experiments on four widely used
datasets including IN, UP, KSC, and Houston 2013 datasets demonstrate that our
framework improves the performance of existing methods and further achieves the

their star-formation through a gradual exhaustion of gas supply or already dead
and are experiencing a rejuvenation of star-formation through fuel injection.
We use the Galaxy And Mass Assembly database and the Galaxy Zoo citizen science
morphological estimates to compare the morphology of galaxies in the green
valley against those in the red sequence and blue cloud.
  Our goal is to examine the structural differences within galaxies that fall
in the green valley, and what brings them there. Previous results found disc
features such as rings and lenses are more prominently represented in the green
valley population. We revisit this with a similar sized data set of galaxies
with morphology labels provided by the Galaxy Zoo for the GAMA fields based on
new KiDS images. Our aim is to compare qualitatively the results from expert

  We observe that ring structures are indeed found more commonly in green
valley galaxies compared to their red and blue counterparts. We suggest that
ring structures are a consequence of disc galaxies in the green valley actively
exhibiting characteristics of fading discs and evolving disc morphology of
galaxies. We note that the progression from blue to red correlates with
loosening spiral arm structure.

core contribution lies in a nonlinear disturbance observer, reconstructing the
forces on a ship impacted by the environment, such as wind, waves, and sea
currents. For this purpose, mappings are found that describe global
exponentially stable error dynamics by assuming slow changes of disturbances.
With the stability theory of Lyapunov, it is proven that the error converges
exponentially into a ball, even if the disturbances are highly dynamic. Since
measurements are affected by noise and physical models can be erroneous, the
measurements are filtered through an unscented Kalman filter and propagated
through the proposed observer to deal with noisy measurements and inaccurate
models. To investigate the capability of this observer framework, the
environmental disturbances are simulated at different severity levels. The
results depict the simulation of a severe, worst-case scenario consisting of
highly dynamic disturbances, intense measurement noise, and an unreliable ship
model. It can be seen that the observer framework accurately reconstructs the
forces on a ship impacted by the environment despite using a low measurement
sampling rate, an erroneous model, and uncertain measurements.

had no satisfactory resolution so far. Various approaches including decoherence
and gravitational interactions have been suggested. In the present work, the
Schr\""odinger-Newton model is used to study the role of semi-classical
self-gravity in the evolution of massive spin-1/2 particles in a Stern-Gerlach
experiment. For small mass, evolution of the initial wavepacket in a spin
superposition shows a splitting in the magnetic field gradient into two
trajectories as in the standard Stern-Gerlach experiment. For larger mass, the
deviations from the central path are less than in the standard Stern-Gerlach
case, while for high enough mass, the wavepacket does not split, and instead
follows the classical trajectory for a magnetic moment in inhomogeneous
magnetic field. This indicates the emergence of classicality due to
self-gravitational interaction when the mass is increased. In contrast,
decoherence which is a strong contender for emergence of classicality, leads to
a \emph{mixed state} of two trajectories corresponding to the spin-up and
spin-down states, and not the classically expected path. The classically
expected path of the particle probably cannot be explained even in the
many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Stern-Gerlach experiments in
the macroscopic domain are needed to settle this question.

observed, and it has recently become feasible to simulate via 3D numerical
models of realistically stratified and convection-driven reconnection. We aim
to illustrate ways by which quiet Sun fields may contribute to solar
atmospheric heating via magnetic reconnection that is driven by convective
motion. We also aim to compare our stratified model to earlier idealized
coronal models in terms of reconnection drivers and topological conditions. We
analyzed a simulation of the quiet Sun in which a complex coronal magnetic
field is self-consistently driven by the underlying convection. We employed a
selection of Lagrangian markers to trace the spatiotemporal behavior of
specific magnetic features that are relevant to magnetic reconnection and
atmospheric heating. A large-scale reconnection-driven heating event occurs in
the simulated corona, in a flattened X-shaped feature characterized by a weak
field and high current. Relevant features include a smooth overlying horizontal
field, an arcade, and a horizontal flux rope which eventually reconnect with
the overlying field, raising coronal plasma temperatures up to 1.47 MK. We find
that our results are in good agreement with idealized coronal flare models,
which demonstrates that the same physical concepts are valid. We also find that
the reconnecting flux rope and arcade are neither formed by any obvious
coherent flux emergence, nor by any ordered photospheric motion or flux
cancellation. Instead, they seem to develop merely from the self-consistent
convective driving of pre-existing tangled field lines. This gradual ordering
suggests an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity via smaller reconnection
events, located at or above photospheric flux concentrations. We suggest that
this case is representative of heating events that may be ubiquitous in the
real quiet Sun.

discusses how learning has been used to enhance key components of SBMPs, such
as node sampling, collision detection, distance or nearest neighbor
computation, local planning, and termination conditions. Then, it highlights
planners that use learning to adaptively select between different
implementations of such primitives in response to the underlying problem's
features. It also covers emerging methods, which build complete machine
learning pipelines that reflect the traditional structure of SBMPs. It also
discusses how machine learning has been used to provide data-driven models of

  Methods","Accepted to findings of ACL 2023",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A popular approach to unveiling the black box of neural NLP models is to
leverage saliency methods, which assign scalar importance scores to each input
component. A common practice for evaluating whether an interpretability method
is faithful has been to use evaluation-by-agreement -- if multiple methods
agree on an explanation, its credibility increases. However, recent work has
found that saliency methods exhibit weak rank correlations even when applied to
the same model instance and advocated for the use of alternative diagnostic
methods. In our work, we demonstrate that rank correlation is not a good fit
for evaluating agreement and argue that Pearson-$r$ is a better-suited
alternative. We further show that regularization techniques that increase
faithfulness of attention explanations also increase agreement between saliency
methods. By connecting our findings to instance categories based on training
dynamics, we show that the agreement of saliency method explanations is very
low for easy-to-learn instances. Finally, we connect the improvement in
agreement across instance categories to local representation space statistics
of instances, paving the way for work on analyzing which intrinsic model
properties improve their predisposition to interpretability methods.

1.3, we study the dependence of the hydrostatic bias on redshift,
concentration, mass growth, dynamical state, mass, and halo shapes. We find
almost no correlation between the bias and any of these parameters. However,
there is a clear evidence that the scatter of the mass-bias distribution is
larger for low-concentrated objects, high mass growth, and more generically for
disturbed systems. Moreover, we carefully study the evolution of the bias of
twelve clusters throughout a major-merger event. We find that the
hydrostatic-mass bias follows a particular evolution track along the merger
process: to an initial significant increase of the bias recorded at the begin
of merger, a constant plateaus follows until the end of merge, when there is a
dramatic decrease in the bias before the cluster finally become relaxed again.
This large variation of the bias is in agreement with the large scatter of the
hydrostatic bias for dynamical disturbed clusters. These objects should be
avoided in cosmological studies because their exact relaxation phase is
difficult to predict, hence their mass bias cannot be trivially accounted for.

is one that outputs an assignment satisfying most of the constraints on
instances that are near-satisfiable. It is known that the CSPs that admit
efficient robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those of bounded width,
i.e., CSPs whose satisfiability can be checked by a simple local consistency
algorithm (eg., 2-SAT or Horn-SAT in the Boolean case). While the exact
satisfiability of a bounded width CSP can be checked by combinatorial
algorithms, the robust algorithm is based on rounding a canonical Semidefinite
programming(SDP) relaxation.
  In this work, we initiate the study of robust satisfaction algorithms for
promise CSPs, which are a vast generalization of CSPs that have received much
attention recently. The motivation is to extend the theory beyond CSPs, as well
as to better understand the power of SDPs. We present robust SDP rounding
algorithms under some general conditions, namely the existence of particular
high-dimensional Boolean symmetries known as majority or alternating threshold
polymorphisms. On the hardness front, we prove that the lack of such
polymorphisms makes the PCSP hard for all pairs of symmetric Boolean
predicates. Our method involves a novel method to argue SDP gaps via the
absence of certain colorings of the sphere, with connections to sphere Ramsey
theory.
  We conjecture that PCSPs with robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely
those for which the feasibility of the canonical SDP implies (exact)
satisfiability. We also give a precise algebraic condition, known as a minion
characterization, of which PCSPs have the latter property.

adversarial attacks is beneficial in guiding the development of machine
learning models on the one hand and finding targeted defenses on the other.
However, most of the adversarial attacks today leverage the gradient or logit
information from the models to generate adversarial perturbation. Works in the
more realistic domain: decision-based attacks, which generate adversarial
perturbation solely based on observing the output label of the targeted model,
are still relatively rare and mostly use gradient-estimation strategies. In
this work, we propose a pixel-wise decision-based attack algorithm that finds a
distribution of adversarial perturbation through a reinforcement learning
algorithm. We call this method Decision-based Black-box Attack with
Reinforcement learning (DBAR). Experiments show that the proposed approach
outperforms state-of-the-art decision-based attacks with a higher attack
success rate and greater transferability.

for people who live or work near pollution sources. Areas adjacent to pollution
sources often have high ambient pollution concentrations, and those areas are
commonly referred to as air pollution hotspots. Detecting and characterizing
pollution hotspots are of great importance for air quality management, but are
challenging due to the high spatial and temporal variability of air pollutants.
In this work, we explore the use of mobile sensing data (i.e., air quality
sensors installed on vehicles) to detect pollution hotspots. One major
challenge with mobile sensing data is uneven sampling, i.e., data collection
can vary by both space and time. To address this challenge, we propose a
two-step approach to detect hotspots from mobile sensing data, which includes
local spike detection and sample-weighted clustering. Essentially, this
approach tackles the uneven sampling issue by weighting samples based on their
spatial frequency and temporal hit rate, so as to identify robust and
persistent hotspots. To contextualize the hotspots and discover potential
pollution source characteristics, we explore a variety of cross-domain urban
data and extract features from them. As a soft-validation of the extracted
features, we build hotspot inference models for cities with and without mobile
sensing data. Evaluation results using real-world mobile sensing air quality
data as well as cross-domain urban data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in detecting and inferring pollution hotspots. Furthermore, the
empirical analysis of hotspots and source features yields useful insights
regarding neighborhood pollution sources.

whether an LLM prefers factually consistent continuations of its input, we
propose a new benchmark called FIB(Factual Inconsistency Benchmark) that
focuses on the task of summarization. Specifically, our benchmark involves
comparing the scores an LLM assigns to a factually consistent versus a
factually inconsistent summary for an input news article. For factually
consistent summaries, we use human-written reference summaries that we manually
verify as factually consistent. To generate summaries that are factually
inconsistent, we generate summaries from a suite of summarization models that
we have manually annotated as factually inconsistent. A model's factual
consistency is then measured according to its accuracy, i.e.\ the proportion of
documents where it assigns a higher score to the factually consistent summary.
To validate the usefulness of FIB, we evaluate 23 large language models ranging
from 1B to 176B parameters from six different model families including BLOOM

factually consistent summaries than to factually inconsistent summaries.
However, if the factually inconsistent summaries occur verbatim in the
document, then LLMs assign a higher score to these factually inconsistent
summaries than factually consistent summaries. We validate design choices in
our benchmark including the scoring method and source of distractor summaries.

two-dimensional monolayers of candidate materials for a quantum spin liquid

propose an experimental setup that exploits nonlocal electrical probes to gain
information on the transport properties of a gapless QSL. The proposed setup is
a spinon-mediated drag experiment: a current is injected in one of the two
layers and a voltage is measured on the second metallic film. The overall
momentum transfer mechanism is a two-step process mediated by Kondo interaction
between the local moments in the quantum spin liquid and the spins of the
electrons. In the limit of negligible momentum relaxed within the QSL layer, we
calculate the drag relaxation rate for Kitaev, $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and U(1) QSLs
using Aslamazov-Larkin diagrams. We find, however, that the case of dominant
momentum relaxation within the QSL layer is far more relevant and thus develop
a model based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation to describe the proposed setup.
Within this framework we calculate the low temperature scaling behavior of the
drag resistivity, both for U(1) and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs with Fermi surfaces. In
some regimes we find a crossover in the temperature scaling that is different
between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and U(1) QSL both because of the non-Fermi liquid
nature of the U(1) QSL, and because of the qualitatively different momentum
relaxation mechanism within the QSL layer. Our findings suggest that parameters
of the system can be tuned to make the spinon-mediated drag a significant
fraction of the total transresistance.

redshift galaxies, including normal star forming galaxies, quasar hosts, and
dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs). However, the impact of outflows on the
evolution of their hosts is still an open question. Here, we analyse the star
formation histories (SFH) and galactic outflow properties of galaxies in
massive haloes ($10^{12}M_{\odot}<M_{\rm vir} <5\times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$) at
$z\gtrsim5.5$ in three zoom-in cosmological simulations from the MassiveFIRE
suite, as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. The
simulations were run with the FIRE-2 model, which does not include feedback
from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The simulated galaxies resemble $z>4$ DSFGs,
with SFRs of $\sim 1000\ M_{\odot}\rm yr^{-1}$ and molecular gas masses of
$M_{\rm mol}\sim 10^{10}\ M_{\odot}$. However, the simulated galaxies are
characterised by higher circular velocities than those observed in high-z
DSFGs. The mass loading factors from stellar feedback are of the order of $\sim
0.1$, implying that stellar feedback is inefficient in driving galactic
outflows and gas is consumed by star formation on much shorter time-scales than
it is expelled from the interstellar medium (ISM). We also find that stellar
feedback is highly inefficient in self-regulating star formation in this
regime, with an average integrated star formation efficiency (SFE) per
dynamical time of $30\%$. Finally, compared to FIRE-2 galaxies hosted in
similarly massive haloes at lower redshift, we find lower mass loading factors
and higher SFEs in the high redshift sample. We argue that both effects
originate from the higher total and gas surface densities that characterise
high$-z$ massive systems.

classical counterparts, including cascade of excitations across length scales.
In two dimensions, the existence of a range of length scales (the inertial
range) over which kinetic energy is transferred from small to large length
scales is known as an inverse energy cascade and has been observed in several
classical systems from soap films to Jupiter's atmosphere. For quantum fluids,
there has been a long debate about the possibility of these inverse cascades,
and while recent works suggest their existence, the microscopic mechanism is
still debated and a direct experimental observation is still missing. In this
work, we report a direct experimental signature of a flux of kinetic energy
from small to large length scales in a quantum fluid of light and the
observation of a Kolmogorov scaling law in the incompressible kinetic energy
spectrum. The microscopic origin of the algebraic exponents in the energy
spectrum is understood by studying the internal structure of quantized vortices
within the healing length and their clustering at large length scales. Finally,
we identify the statistical relationship between the inverse energy cascade and

sub-grid prescriptions to discretise continuous equations across the time
domain. In this paper, we investigate how the stochastic nature of these
models, notably star formation, black hole accretion, and their associated
feedback, that act on small ($<$ kpc) scales, can back-react on macroscopic
galaxy properties (e.g. stellar mass and size) across long ($>$ Gyr)
timescales. We find that the scatter in scaling relations predicted by the
EAGLE model implemented in the SWIFT code can be significantly impacted by
random variability between re-simulations of the same object, even when
galaxies are resolved by tens of thousands of particles. We then illustrate how
re-simulations of the same object can be used to better understand the
underlying model, by showing how correlations between galaxy stellar mass and
black hole mass disappear at the highest black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH} > 10^8$
M$_\odot$), indicating that the feedback cycle may be interrupted by external
processes. We find that although properties that are collected cumulatively
over many objects are relatively robust against random variability (e.g. the
median of a scaling relation), the properties of individual galaxies (such as
galaxy stellar mass) can vary by up to 25\%, even far into the well-resolved
regime, driven by bursty physics (black hole feedback) and mergers between
galaxies. We suggest that studies of individual objects within cosmological
simulations be treated with caution, and that any studies aiming to closely
investigate such objects must account for random variability within their
results.

quantity that is poorly determined from current experiments. Neutrino-proton
elastic scattering (pES) is a promising channel to measure this quantity, and
requires an intense source of low-energy neutrinos and a low-threshold detector
with excellent resolution. In this paper, we propose that neutrinos from a
galactic supernova and their interactions with protons in large-volume
scintillation detectors can be utilized to determine $\Delta s$. The spectra of
all flavors of supernova neutrinos can be independently determined using a
combination of DUNE and Super-(Hyper-)Kamiokande. This allows us to predict pES
event rates in JUNO and THEIA, and estimate $\Delta s$ by comparing with
detected events. We find that the projected sensitivity for a supernova at 1
kpc (10 kpc), is approximately $\pm 0.01$ ($\pm 0.15$). Interestingly, the
limits from a nearby supernova would be comparable to the results from lattice
QCD, and better than polarized deep-inelastic scattering experiments. Using
supernova neutrinos provides a true $Q^2\rightarrow 0$ measurement, and thus an
axial-mass independent determination of $\Delta s$.

retrofitting pre-trained distributional word vectors by integrating external

benefit of our sexist word embeddings (SexWEs) specialised by our framework via
intrinsic evaluation of word similarity and extrinsic evaluation of sexism

information between the system and a reference which purifies the encoded

requirement and propose a model that consists of a large number $N^2$ of

eigenvalues of the Hamitlonian to appear in pairs of $\lbrace E, -E\rbrace $.
Thus, a naive prediction might lead to only even-order EPs at zero energy.
However, we show that odd-order EPs can exist and exhibit enhanced sensitivity
in the behaviour of eigenvector-coalescence in their neighbourhood, depending
on how we approach the degenerate point. The odd-order EPs can be understood as
a mixture of higher- and lower-valued even-order EPs. Such an anomalous
behaviour is related to the irregular topology of the EPs as the subspace of
the Hamiltonians in question, which is a unique feature of the Jordan blocks.
The enhanced eigenvector sensitivity can be described by observing how the
quantum distance to the target eigenvector converges to zero. In order to
capture the eigenvector-coalescence, we provide an algebraic method to describe
the conditions for the existence of these EPs. This complements previous

program does not influence its observable output. Proving information flow
security is especially challenging for concurrent programs, where operations on
secret data may influence the execution time of a thread and, thereby, the
interleaving between different threads. Such internal timing channels may
affect the observable outcome of a program even if an attacker does not observe
execution times. Existing verification techniques for information flow security
in concurrent programs attempt to prove that secret data does not influence the
relative timing of threads. However, these techniques are often restrictive
(for instance because they disallow branching on secret data) and make strong
assumptions about the execution platform (ignoring caching, processor
instructions with data-dependent runtime, and other common features that affect
execution time). In this paper, we present a novel verification technique for
secure information flow in concurrent programs that lifts these restrictions
and does not make any assumptions about timing behavior. The key idea is to
prove that all mutating operations performed on shared data commute, such that
different thread interleavings do not influence its final value. Crucially,
commutativity is required only for an abstraction of the shared data that
contains the information that will be leaked to a public output. Abstract
commutativity is satisfied by many more operations than standard commutativity,
which makes our technique widely applicable. We formalize our technique in
CommCSL, a relational concurrent separation logic with support for
commutativity-based reasoning, and prove its soundness in Isabelle/HOL. We
implemented CommCSL in HyperViper, an automated verifier based on the Viper
verification infrastructure, and demonstrate its ability to verify challenging

  Contextual Language Models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The awareness and mitigation of biases are of fundamental importance for the
fair and transparent use of contextual language models, yet they crucially
depend on the accurate detection of biases as a precursor. Consequently,
numerous bias detection methods have been proposed, which vary in their
approach, the considered type of bias, and the data used for evaluation.
However, while most detection methods are derived from the word embedding
association test for static word embeddings, the reported results are
heterogeneous, inconsistent, and ultimately inconclusive. To address this
issue, we conduct a rigorous analysis and comparison of bias detection methods
for contextual language models. Our results show that minor design and
implementation decisions (or errors) have a substantial and often significant
impact on the derived bias scores. Overall, we find the state of the field to
be both worse than previously acknowledged due to systematic and propagated
errors in implementations, yet better than anticipated since divergent results
in the literature homogenize after accounting for implementation errors. Based
on our findings, we conclude with a discussion of paths towards more robust and
consistent bias detection methods.

the philosophy of Quantum Mechanics, since it represents not only a technical
difficulty for the standard formulation of the theory, but also a source of
interpretational disputes concerning the meaning of the quantum postulates.
Another conundrum intimately connected with the QMP is the Wigner friend
paradox, a thought experiment underlining the incoherence between the two
dynamical laws governing the behavior of quantum systems, i.e the Schr\""odinger
equation and the projection rule. Thus, every alternative interpretation aiming
to be considered a sound formulation of QM must provide an explanation to these
puzzles associated with quantum measurements. It is the aim of the present
essay to discuss them in the context of Relational Quantum Mechanics. In fact,
it is shown here how this interpretative framework dissolves the QMP. More
precisely, two variants of this issue are considered: on the one hand, I focus
on the ""the problem of outcomes"" contained in Maudlin (1995) - in which the
projection postulate is not mentioned - on the other hand, I take into account
Rovelli's reformulation of this problem proposed in Rovelli (2022), where the
tension between the Schr\""odinger equation and the stochastic nature of the
collapse rule is explicitly considered. Moreover, the relational explanation to
the Wigner's friend paradox is reviewed, taking also into account some
interesting objections contra Rovelli's theory contained in Laudisa (2019). I
contend that answering these critical remarks leads to an improvement of our
understanding of RQM. Finally, a possible objection against the relational
solution to the QMP is presented and addressed.

number of examples following our proposed multi-step rationale schema, treating
each reasoning step as a separate task to be performed by a generative language

at 856--1712\,MHz, observed with the MeerKAT Thousand Pulsar Array Programme.
Scintillation arcs appear to be ubiquitous in clean, high S/N observations,
their detection mainly limited by short observing durations and coarse
frequency channel resolution. This led the survey to be sensitive to nearby,
lightly scattered pulsars with high effective velocity -- from a large proper
motion, a screen nearby the pulsar, or a screen near the Earth. We measure the
arc curvatures in all of our sources, which can be used to give an estimate of
screen distances in pulsars with known proper motion, or an estimate of the
proper motion. The short scintillation timescale in J1731$-$4744 implies a
scattering screen within 12\,pc of the source, strongly suggesting the
association between this pulsar and the supernova remnant RCW 114. We measure
multiple parabolic arcs of 5 pulsars, all of which are weakly scintillating
with high proper motion. Additionally, several sources show hints of inverted
arclets suggesting scattering from anisotropic screens. Building on this work,
further targeted MeerKAT observations of many of these pulsars will improve
understanding of our local scattering environment and the origins of
scintillation; annual scintillation curves would lead to robust screen distance
measurements, and the evolution of arclets in time and frequency can constrain
models of scintillation.

We have expanded a previously existing 3D radiative MHD numerical model of the
solar atmosphere, which included self-consistently locally driven magnetic
amplification in the chromosphere, by adding ambipolar diffusion and
time-dependent non-equilibrium hydrogen ionization to the model. The energy of
the magnetic field is dissipated in the upper chromosphere, providing a large
temperature increase due to ambipolar diffusion and the non-equilibrium
ionization (NEQI). At the same time, we find that adding the ambipolar
diffusion and NEQI in the simulation has a minor impact on the local growth of
the magnetic field in the lower chromosphere and its dynamics. Our comparison
between synthesized Mg II profiles from these high spatial resolution models,
with and without ambipolar diffusion and NEQI, and quiet Sun and coronal hole
observations from IRIS now reveal a better correspondence. The intensity of
profiles is increased and the line cores are slightly broader when ambipolar
diffusion and NEQI effects are included. Therefore, the Mg II profiles are
closer to those observed than in previous models, but some differences still

Context Matched Collages, which leverage explicit context labels to combine
unused background examples with existing annotated data to synthesize

range of scientific and engineering fields, from healthcare to structural
materials to transportation. In this paper we propose a specially designed deep
neural network, DyFraNet, which can predict dynamic fracture behaviors by
identifying a complete history of fracture propagation - from cracking onset,
as a crack grows through the material, modeled as a series of frames evolving
over time and dependent on each other. Furthermore, this model can not only
forecast future fracture processes but also backcast to elucidate the past
fracture history. In this scenario, once provided with the outcome of a
fracture event, the model will elucidate past events that led to this state and
will predict the future evolution of the failure process. By comparing the
predicted results with atomistic-level simulations and theory, we show that
DyFraNet can capture dynamic fracture mechanics by accurately predicting how
cracks develop over time, including measures such as the crack speed, as well
as when cracks become unstable. We use GradCAM to interpret how DyFraNet
perceives the relationship between geometric conditions and fracture dynamics
and we find DyFraNet pays special attention to the areas around crack tips,
which have a critical influence in the early stage of fracture propagation. In
later stages, the model pays increased attention to the existing or newly
formed damage distribution in the material. The proposed approach offers
significant potential to accelerate the exploration of the dynamics in material
design against fracture failures and can be beneficially adapted for all kinds
of dynamical engineering problems.

subsystems. On the example of strongly coupled two-level atoms, we show that
near the transition point enhancement of energy transport between the system

normalized to the coupling constant reaches the maximum both in the cases of
zero and non-zero frequency detuning. We show that maximization of normalized
energy flow can be used for the determination of the transition to the strong

machine learning models, including neural networks. Biases are thought to
enhance the representational power of neural networks, enabling them to solve a
variety of tasks in computer vision. However, we argue that biases can be
disregarded for some image-related tasks such as image classification, by
considering the intrinsic distribution of images in the input space and desired
model properties from first principles. Our findings suggest that zero-bias
neural networks can perform comparably to biased networks for practical image
classification tasks. We demonstrate that zero-bias neural networks possess a
valuable property called scalar (multiplication) invariance. This means that
the prediction of the network remains unchanged when the contrast of the input
image is altered. We extend scalar invariance to more general cases, enabling
formal verification of certain convex regions of the input space. Additionally,
we prove that zero-bias neural networks are fair in predicting the zero image.
Unlike state-of-the-art models that may exhibit bias toward certain labels,
zero-bias networks have uniform belief in all labels. We believe dropping bias
terms can be considered as a geometric prior in designing neural network
architecture for image classification, which shares the spirit of adapting
convolutions as the transnational invariance prior. The robustness and fairness
advantages of zero-bias neural networks may also indicate a promising path
towards trustworthy and ethical AI.

assembly and evolution. Calibrations exist for computing SFR from a combination
of ultraviolet and infrared bands for galaxies as integrated systems, but their
applicability to sub-galactic (kpc) scales remains largely untested. Here we
use integral field spectroscopy of 19 nearby ($D <$ 20 Mpc) galaxies obtained
by PHANGS-MUSE to derive accurate Balmer decrements (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) and
attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$ maps. We combine this information with
mid-infrared maps from WISE at 22 $\rm \mu m$, and ultraviolet maps from GALEX
in the far-UV band, to derive SFR surface densities in nearby galaxies on
resolved (kpc) scales. Using the H$\alpha$ attenuation-corrected SFR as a
reference, we find that hybrid recipes from the literature overestimate the SFR
in regions of low SFR surface density, low specific star-formation rate (sSFR),
low attenuation and old stellar ages. We attribute these trends to heating of
the dust by old stellar populations (IR cirrus). We calibrate this effect by
proposing functional forms for the coefficients in front of the IR term which
depend on band ratios sensitive to the sSFR. These calibrations prove reliable
as a function of physical scale. In particular, they agree within 10% with the
attenuation corrections computed from the Balmer decrement on 100 pc scales.
Despite small quantitative differences, our calibrations are also applicable to
integrated galaxy scales probed by the MaNGA survey, albeit with a larger
scatter (up to 0.22 dex). Observations with JWST open up the possibility to
calibrate these relations in nearby galaxies with cloud-scale ($\sim$100 pc)
resolution mid-IR imaging.

kpc) at a ~600pc delensed physical resolution along the kinematic major axis.
Our results show high intrinsic dispersions of the cold molecular and warm

out to R_e; a moderately low dark matter fraction (f_DM(R_e) ~ 0.3-0.4) within

previously established sig0 vs. z, f_DM vs. Sig_baryon, and Q's radial trends

high stellar mass concentration within ~1-2 kpc with little molecular gas, and
a clumpy molecular gas ring-like structure at R ~ 2-4 kpc, in line with the
inside-out quenching scenario. Our further analysis indicates that J0901 had
assembled half of its stellar mass only ~400 Myrs before its observed cosmic

the impact of drugs, genes, context, sensory stimuli and neural activity on
behavior. Here we present a protocol for performing Motion Sequencing (MoSeq),
an ethologically-inspired method that uses 3D machine vision and unsupervised
machine learning to decompose spontaneous mouse behavior in the laboratory into
a series of elemental modules called ""syllables"". This protocol is based upon a
notebook-based pipeline for MoSeq that includes modules for depth video
acquisition, data pre-processing and modeling, as well as a standardized set of
visualization tools. Users are provided with instructions and code for building
a MoSeq imaging rig and acquiring three-dimensional video of spontaneous mouse
behavior for submission to the modeling framework; the outputs of this protocol
include syllable labels for each frame of video data as well as summary plots
describing how often each syllable was used and how syllables transitioned from
one to the other over time. This protocol and the accompanying pipeline
significantly lower the bar for adopting this unsupervised, data-driven
approach to characterizing mouse behavior, enabling users without significant
computational ethology experience to gain insight into how the structure of
behavior is altered after experimental manipulations.

time stamps and associated event types (""marks""), are an important type of
sequential data with many applications, e.g., in clinical medicine or user
behavior modeling. Since these data are typically modeled autoregressively
(e.g., using neural Hawkes processes or their classical counterparts), it is
natural to ask questions about future scenarios such as ""what kind of event

Unfortunately, some of these queries are notoriously hard to address since
current methods are limited to naive simulation, which can be highly
inefficient. This paper introduces a new typology of query types and a
framework for addressing them using importance sampling. Example queries
include predicting the $n^\text{th}$ event type in a sequence and the hitting
time distribution of one or more event types. We also leverage these findings
further to be applicable for estimating general ""$A$ before $B$"" type of
queries. We prove theoretically that our estimation method is effectively
always better than naive simulation and show empirically based on three
real-world datasets that it is on average 1,000 times more efficient than
existing approaches.

Indeed, amalgamating quantum technologies and NTNs will scale up the quantum

processing. The proposed approach uses a hierarchical process to first identify
source codes with vulnerabilities, and then it identifies the lines of codes
that contribute to the vulnerability within the detected source codes. This
proposed two-step approach reduces the false alarm of detecting vulnerable
lines. Our extensive experiment on real-world and synthetic codes collected in

approximately three semi-major axes from the barycentre of their system,
curiously close to low-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs). The formation
mechanism of these circumbinary planets is not yet fully understood. In situ
formation is extremely challenging because of the strong interaction with the
binary. One possible explanation is that, after their formation, the
interactions between these planets and the surrounding protoplanetary disc
cause them to migrate at velocities dependent on the nature of the disc and the
mass of the exoplanet. Although extensive data can be obtained with direct
hydrodynamical simulations, their computational cost remains too high. On the
other hand, the direct n-body simulations approach allows us to model a large
variety of parameters at much lower cost. We analyse the planetary migration
around a wide variety of binary stars using Stokes-like forces that mimic
planetary migration at a constant rate. Our goal is to identify the main
parameters responsible for the ejection of planets at different resonances with
the inner binary. We performed 4200 n-body simulations with Stokes-like forces
and analysed their evolution and outcome as a function of the properties of
each system. For each simulated exoplanet, we applied an ensemble learning
method for classification in order to clarify the relationship between the
inspected parameters and the process of MMR capture. We identify the capture
probability for different N/1 MMRs, 4/1 being the most prone to capture
exoplanets, with 37% probability, followed by MMR 5/1 with $\sim$ 23% of
probability. The eccentricity of the binary is found to be the most important
parameter in determining the MMR capture of each circumbinary exoplanet,

spin-transfer torque in non-centrosymmetric Weyl magnets, we show that the
chiral photocurrent rotates the magnetization from the easy c axis to the a or

chiral photocurrent is calculated in the context of quantum kinetic theory and
it has a strong resonance on the order of mA/W near the Weyl nodes, the
magnitude of which is controlled by the momentum relaxation time. Remarkably,
we study the influence of magnetic texture dynamics on the topological

is inappropriate to conduct AD detection using utterance information alone
while ignoring dialogue information; 2) Utterances of AD patients contain many

patients tend to speak less, causing dialogue breakdown as the disease
progresses. This fact leads to a small number of utterances, which may cause

an unfeasible task. Virtual experiments using simulations are usually used to
support the development process. However, numerical simulations are limited by
their computational cost. Metamodeling techniques are commonly used to mimic
the behavior of unknown solver functions, especially for expensive black box
optimizations. If a good correlation between the surrogate model and the black
box function is obtained, expensive numerical simulations can be significantly
reduced. The sampling strategy, which selects a subset of samples that can
adequately predict the behavior of expensive black box functions, plays an
important role in the fidelity of the surrogate model. Achieving the desired
metamodel accuracy with as few solver calls as possible is the main goal of
global surrogate modeling. In this paper, exploration-oriented adaptive
sampling strategies are compared with commonly used one-stage sampling
approaches, such as Latin Hypercube Design (LHD). The difference in the quality
of approximation is tested on benchmark functions from 2 up to 30 variables.
Two novel sampling algorithms to get fine-grained quasi-LHDs will be proposed
and an improvement to a well-known, pre-existing sequential input algorithm
will be discussed. Finally, these methods are applied to a crash box design to
investigate the performance when approximating highly non-linear
crashworthiness problems. It is found that adaptive sampling approaches
outperform one-stage methods both in terms of mathematical properties and in
terms of metamodel accuracy in the majority of the tests. A proper stopping
algorithm should also be employed with adaptive methods to avoid oversampling.

Therefore, understanding the interactions between defects and a qubit in a real

standard tunneling model, the electric field distributions in the qubit, and
open quantum system dynamics, and draws from the current understanding of
two-level system (TLS) theory. Specifically, we start with one million TLSs
distributed on the surface of a qubit and pick the 200 systems that are most
strongly coupled to the qubit. We then perform a full Lindbladian simulation
that explicitly includes the coherent coupling between the qubit and the TLS
bath to model the time dependent density matrix of resonant TLS defects and the
qubit. We find that the 200 most strongly coupled TLSs can accurately describe
the qubit energy relaxation time. This work confirms that resonant TLSs located
in areas where the electric field is strong can significantly affect the qubit
relaxation time, even if they are located far from the Josephson junction.
Similarly, a strongly-coupled resonant TLS located in the Josephson junction
does not guarantee a reduced qubit relaxation time if a more strongly coupled
TLS is far from the Josephson junction. In addition to the coupling strengths
between TLSs and the qubit, the model predicts that the geometry of the device
and the TLS relaxation time play a significant role in qubit dynamics. Our work
can provide guidance for future quantum processor designs with improved qubit

quantified and transformed into intelligence for private or public benefit.
When used responsibly, this offers new opportunities for public good. However,
three key forms of asymmetry currently limit this potential, especially for
already vulnerable and marginalized groups: data asymmetries, information
asymmetries, and agency asymmetries. These asymmetries limit human potential,
both in a practical and psychological sense, leading to feelings of
disempowerment and eroding public trust in technology. Existing methods to
limit asymmetries (e.g., consent) as well as some alternatives under
consideration (data ownership, collective ownership, personal information
management systems) have limitations to adequately address the challenges at
hand. A new principle and practice of digital self-determination (DSD) is
therefore required.
  DSD is based on existing concepts of self-determination, as articulated in
sources as varied as Kantian philosophy and the 1966 International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Updated for the digital age, DSD contains
several key characteristics, including the fact that it has both an individual
and collective dimension; is designed to especially benefit vulnerable and
marginalized groups; and is context-specific (yet also enforceable).
Operationalizing DSD in this (and other) contexts so as to maximize the
potential of data while limiting its harms requires a number of steps. In
particular, a responsible operationalization of DSD would consider four key
prongs or categories of action: processes, people and organizations, policies,
and products and technologies.

tabular data and are used in a number of different venues (newspapers,
articles, etc). These maps are human-readable but are often challenging to deal
with when trying to extract data for screen readers, analyses, or other related
tasks. Recent research into Visual-Question Answering (VQA) has studied
question answering on human-generated charts (ChartQA), such as bar, line, and
pie charts. However, little work has paid attention to understanding maps;
general VQA models, and ChartQA models, suffer when asked to perform this task.
To facilitate and encourage research in this area, we present MapQA, a
large-scale dataset of ~800K question-answer pairs over ~60K map images. Our
task tests various levels of map understanding, from surface questions about
map styles to complex questions that require reasoning on the underlying data.
We present the unique challenges of MapQA that frustrate most strong baseline
algorithms designed for ChartQA and general VQA tasks. We also present a novel
algorithm, Visual Multi-Output Data Extraction based QA (V-MODEQA) for MapQA.
V-MODEQA extracts the underlying structured data from a map image with a
multi-output model and then performs reasoning on the extracted data. Our
experimental results show that V-MODEQA has better overall performance and
robustness on MapQA than the state-of-the-art ChartQA and VQA algorithms by
capturing the unique properties in map question answering.

fields up to 15 T. We also report measurements of the thermal Hall effect,
found to be vanishingly small. At high temperatures, in the paramagnetic
regime, the thermal conductivity has a negligible field dependence. Upon
cooling and the development of correlations, the onset of a clear monotonic
field dependence below about 20 K signals a new characteristic temperature
scale that may reflect the subtle crossover towards the quantum spin liquid
regime. Deconfined spinons, if present, are not detected and phonons, as the
main carriers of heat, are strongly scattered by the intrinsic spin excitations
and the magnetic defects. In view of the colossal fields required to affect the
intrinsic spins, most of the field-induced evolution is attributed to the
progressive polarization of some magnetic defects. By elaborating a
phenomenological model, we extract the magnetization of these main scattering
centers which does not resemble the Brillouin function for free spins 1/2,
requiring to go beyond the paradigm of isolated paramagnetic spins. Besides,
the onset of a nonmonotonic field dependence below about 2 K underlines the
existence of another characteristic temperature scale, previously highlighted
with other measurements, and sheds new light on the phase diagram of
herbertsmithite down to the lowest temperatures.

where a model fine-tuned on a source language achieves surprisingly good
performance on a target language. While studies have attempted to understand
transfer, they focus only on MLM, and the large number of differences between
natural languages makes it hard to disentangle the importance of different
properties. In this work, we specifically highlight the importance of word
embedding alignment by proposing a pre-training objective (ALIGN-MLM) whose
auxiliary loss guides similar words in different languages to have similar word
embeddings. ALIGN-MLM either outperforms or matches three widely adopted
objectives (MLM, XLM, DICT-MLM) when we evaluate transfer between pairs of
natural languages and their counterparts created by systematically modifying
specific properties like the script. In particular, ALIGN-MLM outperforms XLM
and MLM by 35 and 30 F1 points on POS-tagging for transfer between languages
that differ both in their script and word order (left-to-right v.s.
right-to-left). We also show a strong correlation between alignment and
transfer for all objectives (e.g., rho=0.727 for XNLI), which together with
ALIGN-MLM's strong performance calls for explicitly aligning word embeddings
for multilingual models.

fiber-orientation distribution compactly and are thus ubiquitous in
injection-molding simulations and subsequent mechanical analyses. In
engineering applications to date, the second-order fiber-orientation tensor is
the basic quantity of interest, and the fourth-order fiber-orientation tensor
is obtained via a closure approximation. Unfortunately, such a description
limits the predictive capabilities of the modeling process significantly,
because the wealth of possible fourth-order fiber-orientation tensors is not
exploited by such closures, and the restriction to second-order
fiber-orientation tensors implies artifacts. Closures based on the second-order
fiber-orientation tensor face a fundamental problem - which fourth-order
fiber-orientation tensors can be realized? In the literature, only necessary
conditions for a fiber-orientation tensor to be connected to a
fiber-orientation distribution are found. In this article, we show that the
typically considered necessary conditions, positive semidefiniteness and a
trace condition, are also sufficient for being a fourth-order fiber-orientation
tensor in the physically relevant case of two and three spatial dimensions.
Moreover, we show that these conditions are not sufficient in higher
dimensions. The argument is based on convex duality and a celebrated theorem of
D. Hilbert (1888) on the decomposability of positive and homogeneous
polynomials of degree four. The result has numerous implications for modeling
the flow and the resulting microstructures of fiber-reinforced composites, in
particular for the effective elastic constants of such materials.

produce large islands of self-assembled monomers, dimers, or macrocycle

circumvents potential challenges with protracted wet-chemical synthesis or low

on the table by failing to maximize feature affinity between images with

Recent improvements on this paradigm (e.g., leveraging multi-modal data,
different images in longitudinal studies, spatial correspondences) either
relied on additional views or made stringent assumptions about data properties,
which can sacrifice generalizability and applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose a new self-supervised contrastive learning method that
uses unsupervised feature clustering to better select positive and negative
image samples. More specifically, we produce pseudo-classes by hierarchically
clustering features obtained by an auto-encoder in an unsupervised manner, and
prevent destructive interference during contrastive learning by avoiding the
selection of negatives from the same pseudo-class. Experiments on 2D skin

Ecological traits of such systems may be often modulated by toxins released in

toxin-mediated alteration of epidemiological traits, has a significant impact

address this, we consider a mathematical model of disease transmission in

Long term dynamics show that the level of environmental toxin determines
disease persistence, and increasing toxin may even eradicate the disease in
certain circumstances. Furthermore, our results demonstrate bistability between

symmetrically coupled to a single Lorentzian photonic cavity. Our study reveals
interesting dynamical characteristics including non-zero steady states,
superradiant decay, enhanced energy transfer and the ability to modulate
oscillations in the atomic system by tuning environmental degrees of freedom.
We also analyse a configuration consisting of a three-atom chain embedded in a
photonic cavity. Similarly, we find a strong enhancement of the energy transfer
rate between the two ends of the chain and identified specific initial
conditions that lead to significantly reduced dissipation between the two atoms
at the end of the chain. Another configuration of interest consists of two
symmetrical detuned reservoirs with respect to the atomic system. In the
single-atom case, we show that it is possible to enhance the decay rate of the
system by modulating its reservoir detuning, while in the many-atom case, this
results in dynamics akin to the on-resonant cavity. Finally, we examine the
validity of rotating wave approximation through a direct comparison against the
numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach. We find good
agreement in the weak coupling regime while in the intermediate coupling
regime, we identify qualitative similarities, but the rotating wave
approximation becomes less reliable. In the moderate coupling regime, we find
deviation of the steady states due to the formation of mixed photon atom
states.

successes in medical image segmentation, but their capability to learn global
representations is still limited due to using small effective receptive fields

long-range dependencies of information for capturing global representations,
yet their ability to model local context is lacking. Integrating CNN and
Transformer to learn both local and global representations while exploring
multi-scale features is instrumental in further improving medical image
segmentation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical CNN and Transformer
hybrid architecture, called ConvFormer, for medical image segmentation.
ConvFormer is based on several simple yet effective designs. (1) A feed forward
module of Deformable Transformer (DeTrans) is re-designed to introduce local
information, called Enhanced DeTrans. (2) A residual-shaped hybrid stem based
on a combination of convolutions and Enhanced DeTrans is developed to capture
both local and global representations to enhance representation ability. (3)
Our encoder utilizes the residual-shaped hybrid stem in a hierarchical manner
to generate feature maps in different scales, and an additional Enhanced
DeTrans encoder with residual connections is built to exploit multi-scale
features with feature maps of different scales as input. Experiments on several
datasets show that our ConvFormer, trained from scratch, outperforms various
CNN- or Transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

surveillance pipeline and there exist numerous re-id frameworks that achieve
satisfactory performance in challenging benchmarks. However, these systems
struggle to generate acceptable results when there are significant differences
between the camera views, illumination conditions, or occlusions. This result
can be attributed to the deficiency that exists within many recently proposed
re-id pipelines where they are predominately driven by appearance-based
features and little attention is paid to other auxiliary information that could
aid the re-id. In this paper, we systematically review the current
State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods in both uni-modal and multimodal person re-id.
Extending beyond a conceptual framework, we illustrate how the existing SOTA
methods can be extended to support these additional auxiliary information and
quantitatively evaluate the utility of such auxiliary feature information,
ranging from logos printed on the objects carried by the subject or printed on
the clothes worn by the subject, through to his or her behavioural
trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
explores the fusion of multiple information to generate a more discriminant
person descriptor and the principal aim of this paper is to provide a thorough
theoretical analysis regarding the implementation of such a framework. In
addition, using model interpretation techniques, we validate the contributions
from different combinations of the auxiliary information versus the original
features that the SOTA person re-id models extract. We outline the limitations
of the proposed approaches and propose future research directions that could be
pursued to advance the area of multi-modal person re-id.

However, even within a district, there are multiple sections used for different
purposes; the term for this is spatial heterogeneity. The spatial heterogeneity
issue has to be considered when attempting to comprehend land prices. If there
is spatial heterogeneity within a district, land prices can be managed by
adopting the spatial clustering method. In this study, spatial attributes
including SOC, socio-demographic features, and spatial information in a
specific district are analyzed with Finite Mixture Modeling (FMM) in order to
find (a) the optimal number of clusters and (b) the association among SOCs,
socio-demographic features, and land prices. FMM is a tool used to find
clusters and the attributes' coefficients simultaneously. Using the FMM method,
the results show that four clusters exist in one district and the four clusters
have different associations among SOCs, demographic features, and land prices.
Policymakers and managerial administration need to look for information to make
policy about land prices. The current study finds the consideration of
closeness to SOC to be a significant factor on land prices and suggests the
potential policy direction related to SOC.

Existing approaches based on dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) typically
require a significant amount of historical data (interactions over time), which
is not always available in practice. The missing links over time, which is a
common phenomenon in graph data, further aggravates the issue and thus creates
extremely sparse and dynamic graphs. To address this problem, we propose a
novel method based on the neural process, called Graph Sequential Neural ODE
Process (GSNOP). Specifically, GSNOP combines the advantage of the neural
process and neural ordinary differential equation that models the link
prediction on dynamic graphs as a dynamic-changing stochastic process. By
defining a distribution over functions, GSNOP introduces the uncertainty into
the predictions, making it generalize to more situations instead of overfitting
to the sparse data. GSNOP is also agnostic to model structures that can be
integrated with any DGNN to consider the chronological and geometrical
information for link prediction. Extensive experiments on three dynamic graph
datasets show that GSNOP can significantly improve the performance of existing
DGNNs and outperform other neural process variants.

applications such as converting simple line drawing to oil painting has
attracted significant attention. The quality of translated images is directly
related to two crucial issues. First, the consistency of the output
distribution with that of the target is essential. Second, the generated output
should have a high correlation with the input. Conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks, cGANs, are the most common models for translating images.
The performance of a cGAN drops when we use a limited training dataset. In this
work, we increase the Pix2Pix (a form of cGAN) target distribution modeling
ability with the help of dynamic neural network theory. Our model has two
learning cycles. The model learns the correlation between input and ground
truth in the first cycle. Then, the model's architecture is refined in the
second cycle to learn the target distribution from noise input. These processes
are executed in each iteration of the training procedure. Helping the cGAN
learn the target distribution from noise input results in a better model
generalization during the test time and allows the model to fit almost
perfectly to the target domain distribution. As a result, our model surpasses
the Pix2Pix model in segmenting HC18 and Montgomery's chest x-ray images. Both
qualitative and Dice scores show the superiority of our model. Although our
proposed method does not use thousand of additional data for pretraining, it
produces comparable results for the in and out-domain generalization compared
to the state-of-the-art methods.

structures in a multidimensional nonlinear medium is a current frontier across
diverse fields. One of the quintessential objects is a ring dark soliton (RDS),
whose dynamics are expected to display remarkable interplay between symmetry
and self-patterned topological defect formation from a transverse (snake)
instability but has thus far evaded full experimental observations. Here, we
report an experimental realization of RDS generation in a two-dimensional
atomic superfluid trapped in a circular box. By quenching the confining box
potential, we observe spontaneous soliton emission from the edge and its
peculiar signature in radial motion. As an RDS evolves, we observe spontaneous
transverse modulations at discrete azimuthal angles, which clearly result in a
patterned formation of a circular vortex dipole array. Through collisions of
the vortex dipoles with the box trap, we observe vortex unbinding, vortex
pinning to the edge, and emission of rarefaction pulses. Our box-quench
protocol opens a new way to study multidimensional dark solitons, structured
formation of topological defects, and potentially the dynamics of ordered
quantum vortex matter.

distributions need to be learned, we initiate the study of such stochastic
problems in the Multi-Armed Bandits model.
  In the Multi-Armed Bandits model we interact with $n$ unknown distributions
over $T$ rounds: in round $t$ we play a policy $x^{(t)}$ and receive a partial
(bandit) feedback on the performance of $x^{(t)}$. The goal is to minimize the
regret, which is the difference over $T$ rounds in the total value of the
optimal algorithm that knows the distributions vs. the total value of our
algorithm that learns the distributions from the partial feedback. Our main
results give near-optimal $\tilde{O}(\mathsf{poly}(n)\sqrt{T})$ total regret
algorithms for both Prophet Inequality and Pandora's Box.
  Our proofs proceed by maintaining confidence intervals on the unknown indices
of the optimal policy. The exploration-exploitation tradeoff prevents us from
directly refining these confidence intervals, so the main technique is to
design a regret upper bound that is learnable while playing low-regret Bandit
policies.

family of 22 favorable-adverse pressure gradients (FAPGs) by using a ceiling

streamwise pressure gradients in the order of favorable followed by adverse,
similar to the pressure gradient sequence over the suction side of an airfoil.
The adverse pressure gradient region of this configuration is studied using
particle image velocimetry (PIV) in the streamwise--wall-normal plane. The
streamwise mean and Reynolds stresses are presented and discussed in this work.
Although favorable and adverse pressure gradients are known to evoke opposing
responses from a TBL, the current adverse pressure gradient (APG) that followed
a favorable pressure gradient (FPG) was not found to 'reverse' the effect of
the FPG. Instead, a complex response that is neither characteristic of a ZPG
nor an APG TBL was observed. The Reynolds stresses showed a bimodal structure,
with the outer-scaled stresses strengthening along the streamwise direction in
$y < ~ 0.2 \delta$ and weakening in $y > ~ 0.2\delta$, where $y$ is the
wall-normal coordinate, and $\delta$, the local boundary layer thickness. These
were signatures of a new internal layer, previously observed in bump/hill
flows, formed due to the pressure gradient sign change from favorable to
adverse. The non-typical structure of and trends in the statistics were more
significant in the stronger pressure gradient cases, where the stronger
upstream FPG seemed to have exerted a stronger influence on the downstream APG.
The current dataset with 22 cases provided a well-resolved picture of the
breakdown of equilibrium of the ZPG TBL under an FAPG configuration. The

consequence of this model are mirror neutron stars -- exotic stars made

and electromagnetically dark. This makes mergers of two mirror neutron stars
detectable and distinguishable in gravitational wave observations, but can we
observationally distinguish between regular neutron stars and those that may

focusing on two possible realizations of mirror matter coupled to standard
model matter within a compact object: (i) mirror matter captured by a neutron
star and (ii) mirror neutron star-neutron star coalescences. Regarding (i), we
find that (non-rotating) mirror-matter-admixed neutron stars no longer have a
single mass-radius sequence, but rather exist in a two-dimensional mass-radius

would span a much wider range of chirp masses and completely different binary
Love relations, allowing merger remnants to be very light black holes. The
implications of this are that gravitational wave observations with advanced

revealed that SAD cases occurring close to the flare maximum contain an
enhanced hot plasma component at 5--7~MK whereas those occurring later
exhibited a depression in hot plasma at 7--12~MK compared to the ambient
supra-arcade plasma. On-disk location of the flare enabled us to examine in
detail the interaction of SADs with the post-flare arcade, whose effects
include 1) transverse oscillations of period $\sim\,$160~s in the supra-arcade
rays in the wake of voids, 2) footpoint brightening in 1700{~\AA} whose peak is
delayed by 22-46~s with respect to the SAD's arrival at the top of the arcade,

mathematical analyses; however, it tends to be biased toward the majority in a

support consensus building (defined here as an acceptable compromise that not
everyone rejects), we developed a composite consensus-building process. The
developed process addresses this issue by combining permissible meeting
analysis with a new ""compromise choice-exploration"" technology, which presents
a consensusable choice that emphasizes fairness and equality among everyone
when permissible meeting analysis fails to do so. When both permissible meeting
analysis and compromise choice exploration do not arrive at a consensus, a
facility is provided to create a sublated choice among those provided by them.
The trial experimental results confirmed that permissive meeting analysis and
compromise choice exploration are sufficiently useful for deriving

is characterized by its ability to derive choices that control the balance
between compromise and fairness. Our proposed composite consensus-building
approach could be applied in a wide range of situations, from local issues in

  Analytical Approach to Bayesian Inference",,,,,"cs.LG math.FA stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, we present the new Orthogonal Polynomials-Quadrature Algorithm
(OPQA), a parallelizable algorithm that estimates both the posterior and the
evidence in a Bayesian analysis in one pass by means of a functional analytic
approach. First, OPQA relates the evidence to an orthogonal projection onto a
special basis of our construct. Second, it lays out a fast and accurate
computational scheme to compute the transform coefficients.
  OPQA can be summarized as follows. First, we consider the $L^2$ space
associated with a measure with exponential weights. Then we constuct a
multivariate orthogonal basis which is dense in this space, such density being
guaranteed by the Riesz's Theorem. As we project the square root of the joint
distribution onto this basis of our choice, the density of the basis allows us
to invoke the Parseval Identity, which equates the evidence with the sum of
squares of the transform coefficients of this orthogonal projection. To compute
those transform coefficients, we propose a computational scheme using
Gauss-Hermite quadrature in higher dimensions. Not only does this approach
avoids the potential high variance problem associated with random sampling
methods, it significantly reduces the complexity of the computation and enables
one to speed up the computational speed by parallelization.
  This new algorithm does not make any assumption about the independence of the
latent variable, nor do we assume any knowledge of the prior. It solves for
both the evidence and the posterior in one pass. An outline of the theoretical
proof of the supporting algorithm will be provided.

The purpose of this contribution is to quantify the degree to which the

graph G is a fundamental problem in computer science. There are myriad
applications of this problem in databases, graph algorithms, and network
science. Often, we need more than just the total count. Especially in large
network analysis, we wish to compute, for each vertex v of G, the number of
H-homomorphisms that v participates in. This problem is referred to as
homomorphism orbit counting, as it relates to the orbits of vertices of H under
its automorphisms.
  Given the need for fast algorithms for this problem, we study when
near-linear time algorithms are possible. A natural restriction is to assume
that the input graph G has bounded degeneracy, a commonly observed property in
modern massive networks. Can we characterize the patterns H for which
homomorphism orbit counting can be done in linear time?
  We discover a dichotomy theorem that resolves this problem. For pattern H,
let l be the length of the longest induced path between any two vertices of the
same orbit (under the automorphisms of H). If l <= 5, then H-homomorphism orbit
counting can be done in linear time for bounded degeneracy graphs. If l > 5,
then (assuming fine-grained complexity conjectures) there is no near-linear
time algorithm for this problem. We build on existing work on dichotomy
theorems for counting the total H-homomorphism count. Somewhat surprisingly,
there exist (and we characterize) patterns H for which the total homomorphism
count can be computed in linear time, but the corresponding orbit counting
problem cannot be done in near-linear time.

types of purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes in the upper
half-space of $\mathbb R^d$ with jump kernels degenerate at the boundary, and
to establish sharp two-sided estimates on the heat kernels. The jump kernels
are of the form $J(x,y)=\mathcal B(x,y)|x-y|^{-\alpha-d}$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$,
where the function $\mathcal B$ depends on four parameters and may vanish at
the boundary. Our results are the first sharp two-sided estimates for the heat
kernels of non-local operators with jump kernels degenerate at the boundary.
The first type of processes we consider are conservative Markov processes on
the closed half-space with jump kernel $J(x,y)$. Depending on the regions where
the parameters belong, the heat kernels estimates have three different forms,
two of them are qualitatively different from all previously known heat kernel
estimates. The second type of processes we consider are the processes above
killed either by a critical potential or upon hitting the boundary of the
half-space. We establish that their heat kernel estimates have the approximate
factorization property with survival probabilities decaying as a power of the
distance to the boundary, where the power depends on the constant in the
critical potential. Finally, by using the heat kernel estimates, we obtain
sharp two-sided Green function estimates that cover the main result of [31].
This alternative proof provides an explanation of the anomalous form of the
estimates.

Golden Retriever (H2GR) system for Hydrogen knowledge discovery and
representation using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Knowledge Graph and
Decision Intelligence. This system represents a novel methodology encapsulating
state-of-the-art technique for evidence-based research grantmanship. Relevant
Hydrogen papers were scraped and indexed from the web and preprocessing was
done using noise and stop-words removal, language and spell check, stemming and
lemmatization. The NLP tasks included Named Entity Recognition using Stanford
and Spacy NER, topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and TF-IDF. The
Knowledge Graph module was used for the generation of meaningful entities and
their relationships, trends and patterns in relevant H2 papers, thanks to an
ontology of the hydrogen production domain. The Decision Intelligence component
provides stakeholders with a simulation environment for cost and quantity
dependencies. PageRank algorithm was used to rank papers of interest. Random
searches were made on the proposed H2GR and the results included a list of
papers ranked by relevancy score, entities, graphs of relationships between the
entities, ontology of H2 production and Causal Decision Diagrams showing
component interactivity. Qualitative assessment was done by the experts and
H2GR is deemed to function to a satisfactory level.

Adversarial Networks and Auto-encoders), AI-synthesized images of the human
face are now of such high quality that humans can hardly distinguish them from
pristine ones. Although existing detection methods have shown high performance
in specific evaluation settings, e.g., on images from seen models or on images
without real-world post-processings, they tend to suffer serious performance
degradation in real-world scenarios where testing images can be generated by
more powerful generation models or combined with various post-processing
operations. To address this issue, we propose a Global and Local Feature Fusion
(GLFF) to learn rich and discriminative representations by combining
multi-scale global features from the whole image with refined local features
from informative patches for face forgery detection. GLFF fuses information
from two branches: the global branch to extract multi-scale semantic features
and the local branch to select informative patches for detailed local artifacts
extraction. Due to the lack of a face forgery dataset simulating real-world
applications for evaluation, we further create a challenging face forgery
dataset, named DeepFakeFaceForensics (DF^3), which contains 6 state-of-the-art
generation models and a variety of post-processing techniques to approach the
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our
method to the state-of-the-art methods on the proposed DF^3 dataset and three
other open-source datasets.

enhancement based on entanglement is a major scientific goal for fields
including computing, networking, simulations, and metrology. The tremendous
challenge arises from the fragility of entanglement in increasingly larger
sized quantum systems. Optical atomic clocks utilizing a large number of atoms
have pushed the frontier of measurement science, building on precise
engineering of quantum states and control of atomic interactions. However,
today's state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks are limited by the quantum
projection noise (QPN) defined by many uncorrelated atoms. Pioneering work on
producing spin squeezed states of atoms has shown a path towards integrating
entanglement into the best performing clocks. However, to directly demonstrate
advantage of quantum entanglement in a working clock we must prevent backaction
effects that degrade quantum coherence and introduce uncontrolled
perturbations, as well as minimize the influence of technical noise arising
from the interrogating clock laser. Here we present a new optical clock
platform integrated with collective strong-coupling cavity QED for quantum
non-demolition (QND) measurement. Optimizing the competition between spin
measurement precision and loss of coherence, we measure a Wineland parameter of
-1.8(7) dB for 1.9x10$^4$ atoms, thus verifying the presence of entanglement.
Furthermore, a moving lattice allows the cavity to individually address two
independent sub-ensembles, enabling us to spin squeeze two clock ensembles
successively and compare their performance. This differential comparison
between the two squeezed clocks directly verifies enhanced clock stability of
2.0(3) dB below QPN, and 0.6(3) dB above the standard quantum limit (SQL), at
the measurement precision level of 10$^{-17}$, without subtracting any
technical noise contributions.

stochastic learning in a server-based architecture. The system comprises a
server and multiple agents, where each agent has its own local cost function.
The agents collaborate with the server to find a minimum of the aggregate of
the local cost functions. In the context of stochastic learning, the local cost
of an agent is the loss function computed over the data at that agent. In this
report, we consider this problem in a system wherein some of the agents may be
Byzantine faulty and some of the agents may be slow (also called stragglers).
In this setting, we investigate the conditions under which it is possible to
obtain an ""approximate"" solution to the above problem. In particular, we
introduce the notion of $(f, r; \epsilon)$-resilience to characterize how well
the true solution is approximated in the presence of up to $f$ Byzantine faulty
agents, and up to $r$ slow agents (or stragglers) -- smaller $\epsilon$
represents a better approximation. We also introduce a measure named $(f, r;
\epsilon)$-redundancy to characterize the redundancy in the cost functions of
the agents. Greater redundancy allows for a better approximation when solving
the problem of aggregate cost minimization.
  In this report, we constructively show (both theoretically and empirically)
that $(f, r; \mathcal{O}(\epsilon))$-resilience can indeed be achieved in
practice, given that the local cost functions are sufficiently redundant.

to fold by rescuing them from kinetically trapped misfolded states. Protein
folding assistance by the chaperonin machinery is obligatory in vivo for a
subset of proteins in the bacterial proteome. Chaperonins are large oligomeric
complexes, with unusual seven fold symmetry (group I) or eight/nine fold
symmetry (group II), that form double-ring constructs, enclosing a central
folding chamber. Dramatic large-scale conformational changes, that take place
during ATP-driven cycles, allow chaperonins to bind misfolded proteins,
encapsulate them into the expanded cavity and release them back into the
cellular environment, regardless of whether they are folded or not. The theory
associated with the iterative annealing mechanism, which incorporated the
conformational free energy landscape description of protein folding,
\textit{quantitatively} explains most, if not all, the available data.
Misfolded conformations are associated with low energy minima in a rugged
energy landscape. Random disruptions of these low energy conformations result
in higher free energy, less folded, conformations that can stochastically
partition into the native state. Group I chaperonins (GroEL homologues in
eubacteria and endosymbiotic organelles), recognize a large number of misfolded
proteins non-specifically and operate through highly coordinated cooperative
motions. By contrast, the less well understood group II chaperonins (CCT in
Eukarya and thermosome/TF55 in Archaea), assist a selected set of substrate
proteins. Chaperonins are implicated in bacterial infection, autoimmune
disease, as well as protein aggregation and degradation diseases. Understanding
the chaperonin mechanism and their substrates is important not only for the
fundamental aspect of cellular protein folding, but also for effective
therapeutic strategies.

that modeling heteroscedastic uncertainty by minimizing a multivariate Gaussian

training, our approach augments a model learning complex spectral mapping with
a temporary submodel to predict the covariance of the enhancement error at each
time-frequency bin. Due to unrestricted heteroscedastic uncertainty, the
covariance introduces an undersampling effect, detrimental to SE performance.
To mitigate undersampling, our approach inflates the uncertainty lower bound
and weights each loss component with their uncertainty, effectively
compensating severely undersampled components with more penalties. Our
multivariate setting reveals common covariance assumptions such as scalar and
diagonal matrices. By weakening these assumptions, we show that the NLL
achieves superior performance compared to popular loss functions including the
mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and scale-invariant

lengthy simulation time due to the lack of systematic design guidance. The
current scattering viewpoint of the RRA element, which couples antenna
structures and switches during the design process, fails to address these
issues. Here, we propose a novel radiation viewpoint to model, evaluate, and
design RRA elements. Using this viewpoint, the design goal is to match the
element impedance to a characteristic impedance pre-calculated by switch
parameters, allowing various impedance matching techniques developed in
classical antennas to be applied in RRA element design. Furthermore, the
theoretical performance limit can be pre-determined at given switch parameters
before designing specific structures, and the constant loss curve is suggested
as an intuitive tool to evaluate element performance in the Smith chart. The
proposed method is validated by a practical 1-bit RRA element with degraded
switch parameters. Then, a 1-bit RRA element with wideband performance is
successfully designed using the proposed design process. The proposed method
provides a novel perspective of RRA elements, and offers a systematic and
effective guidance for designing wideband, multiband, and high-frequency RRAs.

simultaneous speech translation (SST) but their correlations with human ratings
of SST, which has been recently collected as Continuous Ratings (CR), are
unclear. In this paper, we leverage the evaluations of candidate systems
submitted to the English-German SST task at IWSLT 2022 and conduct an extensive
correlation analysis of CR and the aforementioned metrics. Our study reveals
that the offline metrics are well correlated with CR and can be reliably used
for evaluating machine translation in simultaneous mode, with some limitations
on the test set size. We conclude that given the current quality levels of SST,
these metrics can be used as proxies for CR, alleviating the need for large
scale human evaluation. Additionally, we observe that correlations of the
metrics with translation as a reference is significantly higher than with
simultaneous interpreting, and thus we recommend the former for reliable
evaluation.

Therefore, one can characterize Quantum Entanglement in the two-qubit mixed
state from the three-qubit entanglement measures. We show that the maximum
violation of Bell's inequality lose one entanglement degree. When considering
the connected correlation, the result contains all necessary entanglement
measures. Hence we eliminate the non-connected sector. We classify the mixed

in each classified class. The entanglement measure also monotonically increases
for the correlation measure. Hence we successfully quantify Quantum
Entanglement. We also compare the result to the logarithmic negativity. The
negativity is increasing for the correlation measure but is not monotonic. In
the end, we discuss whether the quantification reflects the degree of
non-locality. We assume that the observable is a vector with the locality but
violates the freedom of choice. The probability distribution of the local
hidden variable needs to depend on a measurement setting. Hence the

adjust the foreground to make it compatible with the background. Recent works
mainly focus on using global transformations (i.e., normalization and color
curve rendering) to achieve visual consistency. However, these models ignore
local visual consistency and their huge model sizes limit their harmonization
ability on edge devices. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical dynamic
network (HDNet) to adapt features from local to global view for better feature
transformation in efficient image harmonization. Inspired by the success of
various dynamic models, local dynamic (LD) module and mask-aware global dynamic
(MGD) module are proposed in this paper. Specifically, LD matches local
representations between the foreground and background regions based on semantic
similarities, then adaptively adjust every foreground local representation
according to the appearance of its $K$-nearest neighbor background regions. In
this way, LD can produce more realistic images at a more fine-grained level,
and simultaneously enjoy the characteristic of semantic alignment. The MGD
effectively applies distinct convolution to the foreground and background,
learning the representations of foreground and background regions as well as
their correlations to the global harmonization, facilitating local visual
consistency for the images much more efficiently. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed HDNet significantly reduces the total model
parameters by more than 80\% compared to previous methods, while still
attaining state-of-the-art performance on the popular iHarmony4 dataset.
Notably, the HDNet achieves a 4\% improvement in PSNR and a 19\% reduction in

physics-aware neural networks. We demonstrate our approach by developing a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for solving an inverse problem for shallow
subsurface imaging. Although CNNs have gained popularity in recent years across
many fields, the development of CNNs remains an art, as there are no clear
guidelines regarding the selection of hyperparameters that will yield the best
network. While optimization algorithms may be used to select hyperparameters
automatically, these methods focus on developing networks with high predictive
accuracy while disregarding model explainability (descriptive accuracy).
However, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses the
absence of model explainability by providing tools that allow developers to
evaluate the internal logic of neural networks. In this study, we use the
explainability methods Score-CAM and Deep SHAP to select hyperparameters, such
as kernel sizes and network depth, to develop a physics-aware CNN for shallow
subsurface imaging. We begin with a relatively deep Encoder-Decoder network,
which uses surface wave dispersion images as inputs and generates 2D shear wave
velocity subsurface images as outputs. Through model explanations, we
ultimately find that a shallow CNN using two convolutional layers with an
atypical kernel size of 3x1 yields comparable predictive accuracy but with
increased descriptive accuracy. We also show that explainability methods can be
used to evaluate the network's complexity and decision-making. We believe this
method can be used to develop neural networks with high predictive accuracy
while also providing inherent explainability.

retrieve images of specific pedestrians using text descriptions. Although
person text-image matching has made great research progress, existing methods
still face two challenges. First, the lack of interpretability of text features
makes it challenging to effectively align them with their corresponding image
features. Second, the same pedestrian image often corresponds to multiple
different text descriptions, and a single text description can correspond to
multiple different images of the same identity. The diversity of text
descriptions and images makes it difficult for a network to extract robust

person text-image matching method by embedding text-feature interpretability

text features by providing them with consistent semantic information with image
features to achieve the alignment of text and describe image region features.To
address the challenges posed by the diversity of text and the corresponding
person images, we treat the variation caused by diversity to features as caused
by perturbation information and propose a novel adversarial attack and defense

framework for feature representation and the adversarial attacks caused by text

additional attack node in the graph convolution layer to improve the robustness

demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of text-pedestrian image matching

(forests, gradient-boosting) have become popular recently due to their ease of
use and accuracy. In this paper, we explore the close connections between TAR
models and regression trees. These enable us to use the rich methodology from
the literature on TAR models to define a hierarchical TAR model as a regression
tree that trains globally across series, which we call SETAR-Tree. In contrast
to the general-purpose tree-based models that do not primarily focus on
forecasting, and calculate averages at the leaf nodes, we introduce a new
forecasting-specific tree algorithm that trains global Pooled Regression (PR)
models in the leaves allowing the models to learn cross-series information and
also uses some time-series-specific splitting and stopping procedures. The
depth of the tree is controlled by conducting a statistical linearity test
commonly employed in TAR models, as well as measuring the error reduction
percentage at each node split. Thus, the proposed tree model requires minimal
external hyperparameter tuning and provides competitive results under its
default configuration. We also use this tree algorithm to develop a forest
where the forecasts provided by a collection of diverse SETAR-Trees are
combined during the forecasting process. In our evaluation on eight publicly
available datasets, the proposed tree and forest models are able to achieve
significantly higher accuracy than a set of state-of-the-art tree-based

with systematic experiments, varying the zero-shear-rate capillary number
$Ca_0$ in the range of $O(10^{-3}-10^2)$ considering the zero-shear-rate
viscosity. The thickness of the deposited liquid film, the bubble speed and the
bubble front/rear menisci are measured, which are further rationalized with the
recent theoretical studies based on appropriate rheological models. Compared
with Newtonian fluids, the film thickness decreases for both the carboxymethyl
cellulose and Carbopol solutions when the shear-thinning effect dominates. We
show that the film thickness follows the scaling law from
\citet{aussillous2000quick} with an effective capillary number $Ca_e$,
considering the characteristic shear rate in the film as proposed by
\citet{picchi2021motion}. $Ca_e$ is calculated by the Carreau number and the
power-law index from the Carreau-Yasuda rheological model. The shear-thinning
effect also influences the bubble speed and delays the transition to the
parabolic region in the bubble front and rear menisci. In particular, a high
degree of undulations on the bubble surface results in intricate rear viscosity
distribution for the rear meniscus and the deviation between the experiments
and theory may require a further investigation to resolve the axial velocity
field. Our study may advance the fundamental understandings and engineering
guidelines for coating processes involving thin-film flows and non-Newtonian
fluids.

In this paper, we propose Learning Mathematical Abstractions (LEMMA): an
algorithm that implements this idea for reinforcement learning agents in
mathematical domains. LEMMA augments Expert Iteration with an abstraction step,
where solutions found so far are revisited and rewritten in terms of new
higher-level actions, which then become available to solve new problems. We
evaluate LEMMA on two mathematical reasoning tasks--equation solving and
fraction simplification--in a step-by-step fashion. In these two domains, LEMMA
improves the ability of an existing agent, both solving more problems and
generalizing more effectively to harder problems than those seen during

source of bias in such estimates, arising from correlations between the viral
load of cases in transmission chains. We show that this mechanism can affect
estimates of fundamental transmission properties characterising the spread of a
virus. Our computational model simulates a disease transmission mechanism in
which the viral load of the infector at the time of transmission influences the
infectiousness of the infectee. These correlations in transmission pairs
produce a population-level decoherence process during which the distributions
of initial viral loads in each subsequent generation converge to a steady
state. We find that outbreaks arising from index cases with low initial viral
loads give rise to early estimates of transmission properties that are subject
to large biases. These findings demonstrate the potential for bias arising from
transmission mechanics to affect estimates of the transmission properties of

gradients in the presence of a temperature gradient. Using molecular-dynamics
simulation of two-component Lennard-Jones liquids, it is demonstrated that
spatially-sinusoidal heat pulses generate both temperature and pressure
gradients. Over short timescales, the dominant effect is the generation of
compressional waves which dissipate over time as the system approaches
mechanical equilibrium. The approach to mechanical equilibrium is also
characterized by a decrease in particle density in the high-temperature region,
and an increase in particle density in the low-temperature region. It is
demonstrated that concentration gradients develop rapidly during the
propagation of compressional waves through the liquid. Over longer timescales,
heat conduction occurs to return the system to thermal equilibrium, with the
particle current acting to restore a more uniform particle density. It is shown
that the Soret effect arises due to the fact that the two components of the
fluid exhibit a different response to pressure gradients. First, the so-called
isotope effect occurs because light atoms tend to respond more rapidly to the
evolving conditions. In this case, there appears to be a connection to previous
observations of fast sound in binary fluids. Second, it is shown that the
partial pressures of the two components in equilibrium, and more directly the
relative magnitudes of their derivatives with respect to temperature and
density, determine which species accumulates in the high- and low-temperature
regions. In the conditions simulated here, the dependence of the partial
pressure on density gradients is larger than the the dependence on temperature
gradients.

critical matter since a few security breaches in merchandise databases in
recent years has caused crucial social and economic impacts such as identity
loss, social panic, and loss of trust in the community. This paper considers an
end-to-end system using dendrites as nano-resolution visual identifiers to
secure supply chains. Dendrites are formed by generating fractal metallic
patterns on transparent substrates through an electrochemical process, which
can be used as secure identifiers due to their natural randomness, high

image authentication method based on Digital Holography (DH). A two-step search
is proposed to make the system scalable by limiting the search space to samples

non-contact technique, is employed to probe the temperature and laser power
dependence property of the Raman active E2ghigh phonon mode; which in turn is
used to estimate the rise in the temperature of the films under different laser
powers. As the conventional Fourier heat diffusion law cannot be directly
employed analytically to estimate the thermal conductivity of these films with

thermal conductivity is estimated to be 87, 55, and 117 W/m.K for the 2, 10,

reveals that the defects/impurities render a much higher resistance to the heat

  (CoRL) 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Contemporary autonomous vehicle (AV) benchmarks have advanced techniques for
training 3D detectors, particularly on large-scale lidar data. Surprisingly,
although semantic class labels naturally follow a long-tailed distribution,
contemporary benchmarks focus on only a few common classes (e.g., pedestrian
and car) and neglect many rare classes in-the-tail (e.g., debris and stroller).
However, AVs must still detect rare classes to ensure safe operation. Moreover,
semantic classes are often organized within a hierarchy, e.g., tail classes
such as child and construction-worker are arguably subclasses of pedestrian.
However, such hierarchical relationships are often ignored, which may lead to
misleading estimates of performance and missed opportunities for algorithmic
innovation. We address these challenges by formally studying the problem of
Long-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates on all classes, including
those in-the-tail. We evaluate and innovate upon popular 3D detection
codebases, such as CenterPoint and PointPillars, adapting them for LT3D. We
develop hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across common-vs-rare
classes, as well as improved detection metrics that award partial credit to
""reasonable"" mistakes respecting the hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a child for an
adult). Finally, we point out that fine-grained tail class accuracy is
particularly improved via multimodal fusion of RGB images with LiDAR; simply
put, small fine-grained classes are challenging to identify from sparse (lidar)
geometry alone, suggesting that multimodal cues are crucial to long-tailed 3D
detection. Our modifications improve accuracy by 5% AP on average for all
classes, and dramatically improve AP for rare classes (e.g., stroller AP
improves from 3.6 to 31.6)! Our code is available at

L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ depends on the samples of its Radon transform at
multiple angles, the real-time imaging sometimes requires the reconstruction of
$f$ by the samples of its Radon transform $\mathcal{R}_{\emph{\textbf{p}}}f$ at
a single angle $\theta$, where $\emph{\textbf{p}}=(\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$ is
the direction vector. This naturally leads to the question of identifying those
functions that can be determined by their Radon samples at a single angle
$\theta$. The shift-invariant space $V(\varphi, \mathbb{Z}^2)$ generated by
$\varphi$ is a type of function space that has been widely considered in many
fields including wavelet analysis and signal processing. In this paper we
examine the single-angle reconstruction problem for compactly supported
functions $f\in V(\varphi, \mathbb{Z}^2)$. The central issue for the problem is
to identify the eligible $\emph{\textbf{p}}$ and sampling set
$X_{\emph{\textbf{p}}}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ can be determined by
its single-angle Radon (w.r.t $\emph{\textbf{p}}$) samples at

eligible $\emph{\textbf{p}}$ for the two cases: (1) $\varphi$ being
nonvanishing
($\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\varphi(\emph{\textbf{x}})d\emph{\textbf{x}}\neq0$) and
(2) being vanishing
($\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}\varphi(\emph{\textbf{x}})d\emph{\textbf{x}}=0$). We prove
that eligible $X_{\emph{\textbf{p}}}$ exists for general $\varphi$. In
particular, $X_{\emph{\textbf{p}}}$ can be explicitly constructed if
$\varphi\in C^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$. The single-angle problem corresponding to
the case that $\varphi$ being positive definite is addressed such that
$X_{\emph{\textbf{p}}}$ can be constructed easily.

subcycle pulse, one can generate a steady electric current (SEC) in a
photoexcited state due to an Aharonov-Bohm flux instantaneously introduced
through the phase of an electric field. Consequently, time-reversal symmetry is
broken. In contrast, a broad subcycle pulse does not induce SEC but instead
generates electric polarization, thus breaking inversion symmetry. Both
symmetry breakings in a photoexcited state can be monitored by second harmonic
generation. These findings provide a new methodology for designing the
symmetries of electronic states and open up a new field of subcycle-pulse
engineering.

like autonomous vehicles, neural networks must accurately estimate their
epistemic or model uncertainty, achieving a level of system self-awareness.
Techniques for epistemic uncertainty quantification often require OOD data
during training or multiple neural network forward passes during inference.
These approaches may not be suitable for real-time performance on
high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, existing methods lack interpretability of
the estimated uncertainty, which limits their usefulness both to engineers for
further system development and to downstream modules in the autonomy stack. We
propose the use of evidential deep learning to estimate the epistemic
uncertainty over a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space in a trajectory
prediction setting. We introduce an interpretable paradigm for trajectory
prediction that distributes the uncertainty among the semantic concepts: past
agent behavior, road structure, and social context. We validate our approach on

the proton is unpolarized or transversely polarized. For the formation of

gets contribution from only one color octet state, as a result, the azimuthal

and thus can be used to probe, in particular the gluon TMDs which are dominant

several missing odd-order steps. But our junctions, which are InAs quantum

are not in the topological regime. We also observe other patterns such as
missing even steps and several missing steps in a row, not relevant to
topological superconductivity. Potentially responsible for our observations is
rounding of not fully developed steps superimposed on non-monotonic resistance

demonstrate that any single pattern, even striking, cannot uniquely identify

problem of budget-feasible mechanism design under a ""small-bidder assumption"".
Anari, Goel, and Nikzad (2018) gave a mechanism that has optimal competitive
ratio $1-1/e$ on worst-case instances. However, we observe that on many
realistic instances, their mechanism is significantly outperformed by a simpler
open clock auction by Ensthaler and Giebe (2014), although the open clock
auction only achieves competitive ratio $1/2$ in the worst case. Is there a
mechanism that gets the best of both worlds, i.e., a mechanism that is
worst-case optimal and performs favorably on realistic instances?
  Our first main result is the design and the analysis of a natural mechanism
that gives an affirmative answer to our question above: (i) We prove that on
every instance, our mechanism performs at least as good as all uniform
mechanisms, including Anari, Goel, and Nikzad's and Ensthaler and Giebe's
mechanisms. (ii) Moreover, we empirically evaluate our mechanism on various
realistic instances and observe that it beats the worst-case $1-1/e$
competitive ratio by a large margin and compares favorably to both mechanisms
mentioned above.
  Our second main result is more interesting in theory: We show that in the
semi-adversarial model of budget-smoothed analysis, where the adversary designs
a single worst-case market for a distribution of budgets, our mechanism is
optimal among all (including non-uniform) mechanisms; furthermore our mechanism
guarantees a strictly better-than-$(1-1/e)$ expected competitive ratio for any
non-trivial budget distribution regardless of the market. We complement the
positive result with a characterization of the worst-case markets for any given
budget distribution and prove a fairly robust hardness result that holds
against any budget distribution and any mechanism.

correspondence plays a major role in determining the accuracy of camera pose. A
sufficient number of well-distributed 2D-3D correspondences is essential for
accurate pose estimation due to noise. However, existing 2D-3D feature matching
methods rely on finding nearest neighbors in the feature space and removing
outliers using hand-crafted heuristics, which may lead to potential matches
being missed or the correct matches being filtered out. In this work, we
propose a novel method called Geometry-Aided Matching (GAM), which incorporates
both appearance information and geometric context to address this issue and to
improve 2D-3D feature matching. GAM can greatly boost the recall of 2D-3D
matches while maintaining high precision. We apply GAM to a new hierarchical
visual localization pipeline and show that GAM can effectively improve the
robustness and accuracy of localization. Extensive experiments show that GAM
can find more real matches than hand-crafted heuristics and learning baselines.
Our proposed localization method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple
visual localization datasets. Experiments on Cambridge Landmarks dataset show
that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and is six

research community. Many recent LNL methods rely on the assumption that clean
samples tend to have ""small loss"". However, this assumption always fails to
generalize to some real-world cases with imbalanced subpopulations, i.e.,
training subpopulations varying in sample size or recognition difficulty.
Therefore, recent LNL methods face the risk of misclassifying those
""informative"" samples (e.g., hard samples or samples in the tail
subpopulations) into noisy samples, leading to poor generalization performance.
  To address the above issue, we propose a novel LNL method to simultaneously
deal with noisy labels and imbalanced subpopulations. It first leverages sample
correlation to estimate samples' clean probabilities for label correction and
then utilizes corrected labels for Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO)
to further improve the robustness. Specifically, in contrast to previous works
using classification loss as the selection criterion, we introduce a
feature-based metric that takes the sample correlation into account for
estimating samples' clean probabilities. Then, we refurbish the noisy labels
using the estimated clean probabilities and the pseudo-labels from the model's
predictions. With refurbished labels, we use DRO to train the model to be
robust to subpopulation imbalance. Extensive experiments on a wide range of
benchmarks demonstrate that our technique can consistently improve current
state-of-the-art robust learning paradigms against noisy labels, especially

destructive interference of multiple incident waves. This concept has been
implemented in various platforms to demonstrate real-time control of
absorption, scattering and radiation by varying the relative phase of the
excitation signals. However, so far these studies have been limited to simple
photonic systems involving single or few modes at well-defined resonant

efficiently model the optical fields within a quasi-normal mode (QNM)

structure of $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ under pressure is described by
two-dimensional Dirac fermions. When the interlayer tunneling is coherent, the
electronic structure of the system becomes three-dimensional, and we expect the
peak structure to appear in the interlayer resistivity under magnetic fields.
We theoretically and experimentally show that the peak appears in the
interlayer resistivity at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. From the
experiment, we estimate that the magnitude of the interlayer tunneling is $t_1
\sim 1$ meV. Our result opens the door to investigating the three-dimensional
electronic structure of $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$.

the W O3 edge whereas signals at the Se M4,5 edges are dominated by phonon

Process (AHP), the most popular scale used to represent linguistic labels
numerically is the linear 1-9 scale, which was proposed by Saaty. However, this
scale has been criticized by several researchers, and various alternatives are
proposed in the literature. There is a growing interest in scale
individualization rather than relying on a generic fixed scale since the
perceptions of the decision maker regarding these linguistic labels are highly
subjective. The methods proposed in the literature for scale individualization
focus on minimizing the transitivity errors, i.e., consistency. In this
research, we proposed a novel, easy-to-learn, easy-to-implement, and
computationally less demanding scale individualization approach based on

metrics that can be used by researchers that contribute to the theory of AHP.
To assess the value of scale individualization in general, and the performance
of the proposed novel approach in particular, numerical and two empirical
studies are conducted. The results of the analyses demonstrate that the scale
individualization outperforms the conventional fixed scale approach and
validates the benefit of the proposed novel heuristic.

in the space of all the Q-functions. A class of information divergence is
defined in the Q-function space for every stage. The main objective is to
propose an estimator of the optimal policy function by a method of minimum
information divergence based on a dataset of trajectories. In particular, we
discuss the $\gamma$-power divergence that is shown to have an advantageous
property such that the $\gamma$-power divergence between policy-equivalent
Q-functions vanishes. This property essentially works to seek the optimal
policy, which is discussed in a framework of a semiparametric model for the
Q-function. The specific choices of power index $\gamma$ give interesting
relationships of the value function, and the geometric and harmonic means of
the Q-function. A numerical experiment demonstrates the performance of the

detectioN), by contextualizing group bias detection in patient illness severity
and past medical history. We investigate and compare SLOGAN's bias detection
capabilities to LOGAN and other clustering techniques across patient subgroups
in the MIMIC-III dataset. On average, SLOGAN identifies larger fairness
disparities in over 75% of patient groups than LOGAN while maintaining
clustering quality. Furthermore, in a diabetes case study, health disparity
literature corroborates the characterizations of the most biased clusters
identified by SLOGAN. Our results contribute to the broader discussion of how

accurate positioning systems in the presence of signal interference. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach through Gradient Boosting
Enhanced with Step-Wise Feature Augmentation using Artificial Neural Network
(AugBoost-ANN) for indoor localization applications as it trains over labeled
data. For this purpose, we propose an IoT architecture using a star network
topology to collect the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) modules by means of a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point (AP) in
an indoor environment. The dataset for the experiments is gathered in the real
world in different periods to match the real environments. Next, we address the
challenges of the AugBoost-ANN training which augments features in each
iteration of making a decision tree using a deep neural network and the
transfer learning technique. Experimental results show more than 8\%
improvement in terms of accuracy in comparison with the existing gradient
boosting and deep learning methods recently proposed in the literature, and our
proposed model acquires a mean location accuracy of 0.77 m.

The rotation of

detailed magnetic measurements across MCs permit us to infer the flux rope
characteristics. Still, the precise spatial distribution of the magnetic twist
is challenging, and thus is debated. In order to improve the robustness of the
results, we performed a superposed epoch analysis (SEA) of a set of well
observed MCs at 1 au. While previous work was done using the MC central time,
we here used the result of a fitted flux rope model to select the time of the
closest approach to the flux rope axis. This implies a precise separation of
the in- and outbound regions to coherently phase the observed signals. We also
searched for and minimised the possible biases such as magnetic asymmetry and a
finite impact parameter. We applied the SEA to derive the median profiles both
for the flux rope remaining when crossed by the spacecraft and to recover the
one present before erosion. In particular, the median azimuthal B component is
nearly a linear function of the radius. More generally, the results confirm our
previous results realised without such a deep analysis. The twist profile is
nearly uniform in the flux rope core, with a steep increase at the border of
the flux rope and with similar profiles in the in- and outbound regions. The
main difference with our previous study is a larger twist by $\sim 20\%$.

effectively takes into account this neglected $U(1)$ gauge field by employing

when training PINN. However, a naive application of forward-mode AD to
conventional PINNs results in higher computation, losing its practical benefit.
Therefore, we propose a network architecture, called separable PINN (SPINN),
which can facilitate forward-mode AD for more efficient computation. SPINN
operates on a per-axis basis instead of point-wise processing in conventional
PINNs, decreasing the number of network forward passes. Besides, while the
computation and memory costs of standard PINNs grow exponentially along with
the grid resolution, that of our model is remarkably less susceptible,
mitigating the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

Diamagnetic levitation has the strong advantage of being the only form of
levitation which is passive, requiring no energy input, while also supporting
massive objects. Known diamagnetic materials which are electrical insulators
are only weakly diamagnetic, and require large magnetic field gradients to
levitate. Strong diamagnetic materials which are electrical conductors, such as
graphite, exhibit eddy damping, restricting motional freedom and reducing their
potential for sensing applications. In this work we describe a method to
engineer the eddy damping while retaining the force characteristics provided by
the diamagnetic material. We study, both experimentally and theoretically, the
motional damping of a magnetically levitated graphite plate in high vacuum and
demonstrate that one can control the eddy damping by patterning the plate with
through-slots which interrupt the eddy currents. We find we can control the
motional quality factor over a wide range with excellent agreement between the

However, recent study shows that the ordinary tokens besides [CLS] may provide

such, it's necessary to extend the current methods where all contextualized

  With this motivation, we propose a new pre-training method: duplex masked

minimize the bag-of-words loss (BoW) about the input sentence based on the
entire ordinary tokens' embeddings. The two decoding losses are added up to
train a unified encoding model. The embeddings from [CLS] and ordinary tokens,
after dimension reduction and aggregation, are concatenated as one unified
semantic representation for the input. DupMAE is simple but empirically
competitive: with a small decoding cost, it substantially contributes to the
model's representation capability and transferability, where remarkable
improvements are achieved on MS MARCO and BEIR benchmarks.

frequency, the oscillations slow down, eventually coming to a halt at an
interesting resonance when measurements are spaced exactly by the time of
transition between the two states. On the other hand, in the limit of large
number of repeated measurements, the dynamics organizes itself in a rather
interesting way about two hyperbolic points in phase space whose stable and
unstable directions are reversed. Thus, the phase space flow occurs from one
hyperbolic point to another, in different ways organized around the
separatrices. We believe that the systematic treatment presented here paves the
way for a better and clearer understanding of quantum Zeno effect in the
context of quantum error correction.

sciences to compare in a geometrically faithful way point clouds and more
generally probability distributions. The wide adoption of OT into existing data
analysis and machine learning pipelines is however plagued by several
shortcomings. This includes its lack of robustness to outliers, its high
computational costs, the need for a large number of samples in high dimension
and the difficulty to handle data in distinct spaces. In this review, we detail
several recently proposed approaches to mitigate these issues. We insist in
particular on unbalanced OT, which compares arbitrary positive measures, not
restricted to probability distributions (i.e. their total mass can vary). This
generalization of OT makes it robust to outliers and missing data. The second
workhorse of modern computational OT is entropic regularization, which leads to
scalable algorithms while lowering the sample complexity in high dimension. The
last point presented in this review is the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance,
which extends OT to cope with distributions belonging to different metric
spaces. The main motivation for this review is to explain how unbalanced OT,
entropic regularization and GW can work hand-in-hand to turn OT into efficient
geometric loss functions for data sciences.

Conventionally, these tasks are offloaded to ground servers for enhanced

computation and transmission costs. The existing offloading schemes, while
being highly-optimized for either costs, can be abysmal for the overall
performance. The computation-transmission cost dilemma is yet to be solved.
  In this paper, we propose an adaptive offloading scheme to reduce the overall

transmission-computation process over the entire network. Specifically, to
represent the computation state migrations, we generalize graph nodes with
multiple states. In this way, the joint optimization problem is transformed
into a shortest path problem over the state graph. We further provide an

show that the proposed scheme outperforms the ground and one-hop offloading

determined by how adequately the effects of noise can be circumvented in

quantum eigensolver (VQE) have been designed for the short-term regime.
However, as problems scale, VQE results are generally scrambled by noise on
present-day hardware. While error mitigation techniques alleviate these issues
to some extent, there is a pressing need to develop algorithmic approaches with
higher robustness to noise. Here, we explore the robustness properties of the
recently introduced quantum computed moments (QCM) approach to ground state
energy problems, and show through an analytic example how the underlying energy
estimate explicitly filters out incoherent noise. Motivated by this
observation, we implement QCM for a model of quantum magnetism on IBM Quantum
hardware to examine the noise-filtering effect with increasing circuit depth.
We find that QCM maintains a remarkably high degree of error robustness where
VQE completely fails. On instances of the quantum magnetism model up to 20
qubits for ultra-deep trial state circuits of up to ~500 CNOTs, QCM is still
able to extract accurate energy estimates. The observation is bolstered by an
extensive set of experimental results. To match this accuracy, VQE would need
hardware improvement by some 2 orders of magnitude on error rates.

in the context of small data global-in-time solutions for compressible

limit from a one-velocity Baer-Nunziato system to a Kapila model as the
pressure-relaxation parameter tends to zero, in a uniform manner with respect
to the time-relaxation parameter associated to the friction forces modeled in
the equation of the velocity. This uniformity allows us to further consider the
time-relaxation limit for the Kapila model. More precisely, we show that the
diffusely time-rescaled solution of the Kapila system converges to the solution
of a two-phase porous media type system as the time-relaxation parameter tends
to zero. For both relaxation limits, we exhibit explicit convergence rates. Our
proof of existence results are based on an elaborate low-frequency and
high-frequency analysis via the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and it includes
three main ingredients: a refined spectral analysis for the linearized problem
to determine the threshold of frequencies explicitly in terms of the
time-relaxation parameter, the introduction of an effective flux in the
low-frequency region to overcome the loss of parameters due to the overdamping
phenomenon, and the renormalized energy estimates in the high-frequency region
to cancel higher-order nonlinear terms. To show the convergence rates, we
discover several auxiliary unknowns that reveal better structures. In
conclusion, our approach may be applied to a class of non-symmetric partially
dissipative hyperbolic system with rough coefficients which do not have any
time-integrability, in the context of overdamping phenomenon. It extends the

electrical switching of ferro-rotational domain states in nanometer-thick

by using a basic quantum optics approach, we numerically achieve excitation
probabilities for the atom to detect a photon as it falls toward the BH
horizon. It turns out that the nature of the emitted radiation deeply drives
its origin from the magnitude of $\Lambda$. In particular, radiation emission
is enhanced due to dilation of the BH horizon by dark energy. Also, we report
an oscillatory nonthermal spectrum in the presence of $\Lambda$, and these
oscillations, in a varying degree, also depend on BH mass and atomic excitation
frequency. We conjecture that such a hoedown may be a natural consequence of a
constrained motion due to the bifurcate Killing horizon of the given spacetime.
The situation is akin to the Parikh-Wilzcek tunneling approach to Hawking
radiation where the presence of extra contributions to the Boltzmann factor
deforms the thermality of flux. It apparently hints at field satisfying a
modified energy-momentum dispersion relation within classical regime of general
relativity arising as an effective low energy consequence of an underlying
quantum gravity theory. Our findings may signal new ways of conceiving the
subtleties surrounding the physics of dark energy.

to investigate the potential consequences of the impact of testing strategy.
The model exhibits global dynamics concerning the disease-free and a unique
endemic equilibrium depending on the basic reproduction number when the
recruitment of infected individuals is zero; otherwise, the model does not have
a disease-free equilibrium, and disease never dies out in the community. Model
parameters have been estimated using the maximum likelihood method with respect
to the data of early COVID-19 outbreak in India. The practical identifiability
analysis shows that the model parameters are estimated uniquely. The
consequences of the testing rate for the weekly new cases of early COVID-19
data in India tell that if the testing rate is increased by 20% and 30% from
its baseline value, the weekly new cases at the peak are decreased by 37.63%
and 52.90%; and it also delayed the peak time by four and fourteen weeks,
respectively. Similar findings are obtained for the testing efficacy that if it
is increased by 12.67% from its baseline value, the weekly new cases at the
peak are decreased by 59.05% and delayed the peak by 15 weeks. Therefore, a
higher testing rate and efficacy reduce the disease burden by tumbling the new
cases, representing a real scenario. It is also obtained that the testing rate
and efficacy reduce the epidemic's severity by increasing the final size of the
susceptible population. The testing rate is found more significant if testing
efficacy is high. Global sensitivity analysis using partial rank correlation
coefficients (PRCCs) and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) determine the key
parameters that must be targeted to worsen/contain the epidemic.

these parameters are configured to minimize the negative influence of OBI on

Yukawa couplings for down-type quarks and/or charged leptons have an opposite
sign as compared to those of the Higgs boson in the standard model, which can
be consistent with current flavour data and the Higgs signal strengths. The
phenomenology of additional Higgs bosons in such a scenario can be
significantly different from that with right-sign Yukawa couplings, mainly due
to a larger Higgs boson mixing to be required in the wrong-sign case. We show
the parameter space which is excluded or explored by direct searches for the
additional Higgs bosons at the current and high-luminosity LHC under the
constraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability. In particular, we
find that most of the parameter space is explored in the WS scenario with the

  The synthetic H$\alpha$ dopplergrams reveal loops that evolve dramatically
within a few minutes. The synthetic H$\alpha$ line profiles show observed
asymmetries and doppler shifts in the line core. They, however, also show
strong emission peaks in the line wings, even at the slated view. The synthetic
Si IV emission features partly coincide with structures visible in H$\alpha$
dopplergrams and partly follow separate magnetic field threads. Some are even

insight into brain rhythms from brain recordings. In event-related protocols,
one applies it to investigate how the brain responds to a stimulation repeated
over many trials. In this framework, three measures have been considered: the
amplitude of the transform for each single trial averaged across trials,
avgAMP; inter-trial phase coherence, ITC; and the power of the evoked potential
transform, POWavg. These three measures are sensitive to different aspects of
event-related responses, ITC and POWavg sharing a common sensitivity to phase
resetting phenomena. Methods. In the present manuscript, we further
investigated the connection between ITC and POWavg using theoretical
calculations, a simulation study and analysis of experimental data. Results. We
derived exact expressions for the relationship between POWavg and ITC in the
particular case of the S-transform of an oscillatory signal. In the more
general case, we showed that POWavg and ITC are connected through a
relationship that roughly reads $\mathrm{POWavg} \approx \mathrm{avgAMP}^2
\times \mathrm{ITC}^2$. This result was confirmed on simulations. We finally
compared the theoretical prediction with results from real data. Conclusion. We
showed that POWavg and ITC are related through an approximate, simple
relationship that also involves avgAMP. Significance. The presented
relationship between POWavg, ITC, and avgAMP confirms previous empirical
evidence and provides a novel perspective to investigate evoked brain rhythms.
It may provide a significant refinement to the neuroscientific toolbox for
studying evoked oscillations.

is assumed that the transmitted words are chosen from an $e$-error-correcting
code $C \ (\subseteq \{0,1\}^n)$. Previously, when $t = e+\ell$ and the length
$n$ of the transmitted word is large enough, the numbers of required channels
are determined for $\mathcal{L} =1, 2 \text{ and } \ell+1$. Here we determine
the exact number of channels in the cases $\mathcal{L} = 3, 4, \ldots, \ell$.
Furthermore, with the aid of covering codes, we also consider the list sizes in
the cases where the length $n$ is rather small (improving previously known
results). After that we study how much we can decrease the number of required

appications, and provide authorized mutability for some specific applications
such as removing illegal content from blockchains. However, the existing
redactable blockchain scheme has low redacting efficiency, and lacks an
accountable and updatable fine-grained mechanism to control redacting rights.
To solve the above problems, we propose an efficient and fine-grained
redactable blockchain scheme with accountability and updatable policies. In our
scheme, the transaction owner can set the updatable policy associated with the
transaction, and only users who meet the policy can become the redactor of the
transaction. In order to prevent redactors from abusing redacting right, we
introduce the concept of a witness group. A redacted transaction is legal if
and only if it contains the signatures of redactor and witness group. We first
give the concept of witness group, and then show the proposed scheme. Finally,
we demonstrate that scheme is feasible and efficient through a series of
experiments and analysis.

Orb-weaver spiders use micron-scale aggregate glue droplets to retain prey in
the capture spiral silks of their orb web. In aggregate glue droplets, highly
glycosylated and phosphorylated proteins dissolve in low molecular mass
compounds. The aggregate glue droplets show a heterogeneous structural
distribution after attaching to the substrate. Although components of the
aggregate glue droplets have been well analyzed and determined in past studies,
visualization of the spatial distribution of their chemical components before
and after their attachment is the key to exploring their adhesion mechanisms.
Here, we investigated the distribution of low molecular mass compounds and
glycoproteins in aggregate glue droplets using the in situ measurement methods
and visualized the role of specific low molecular mass compounds in promoting
glycoprotein modification in the aggregate glue. The results of the analysis
suggest that the constituents of aggregate glue droplets include at least one
ionic liquid: hydrated choline dihydrogen phosphate, while the modification of
glycoproteins in aggregate glue depends on the concentration of this ionic
liquid. This natural ionic liquid does not affect the fluorescence activity of
fluorescent proteins, indicating that proteins of aggregate glue droplets can
be dissolved well and maintain the stability of their higher-order structures
in that ionic liquid. As a natural ionic liquid, aggregate glue droplets from
the spider orb webs may be an excellent ionic liquid material model.

computation and transmission resources. Conventional ground-offloading
techniques, which transmit large amounts of raw data to the ground, suffer from
poor satellite-to-ground link quality. In addition, existing
satellite-offloading techniques, which offload computational tasks to low earth
orbit (LEO) satellites located within the visible range of RS satellites for
processing, cannot leverage the full computing capability of the network
because the computational resources of visible LEO satellites are limited. This
situation is even worse in hotspot areas.
  In this paper, for efficient offloading via LEO satellite networks, we
propose a novel computing-aware routing scheme. It fuses the transmission and
computation processes and optimizes the overall delay of both. Specifically, we
first model the LEO satellite network as a snapshot-free dynamic network, whose
nodes and edges both have time-varying weights. By utilizing time-varying
network parameters to characterize the network dynamics, the proposed method
establishes a continuous-time model which scales well on large networks and
improves the accuracy. Next, we propose a computing-aware routing scheme
following the model. It processes tasks during the routing process instead of
offloading raw data to ground stations, reducing the overall delay and avoiding
network congestion consequently. Finally, we formulate the computing-aware
routing problem in the dynamic network as a combination of multiple dynamic
single source shortest path (DSSSP) problems and propose a genetic algorithm
(GA) based method to approximate the results in a reasonable time. Simulation
results show that the computing-aware routing scheme decreases the overall
delay by up to 78.31% compared with offloading raw data to the ground to
process.

ferromagnetic and a locally ordered $XY$ phase, known as $\Gamma_5$, which
displays an accidental classical U(1) degeneracy. Quantum zero-point energy
fluctuations are found to lift the classical ground state degeneracy and select
the $\psi_3$ state in most parts of the $\Gamma_5$ regime. Likewise, thermal
fluctuations treated classically, select the $\psi_3$ state at $T=0^+$. In
contrast, classical Monte Carlo finds that the system orders at $T_c$ in the
$\psi_2$ state of $\Gamma_5$ for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and
indirect DMI with a transition from $\psi_2$ to $\psi_3$ at a temperature
$T_{\Gamma_5} <T_c$. The same method finds that the system orders via a single
transition at $T_c$ directly into the $\psi_3$ state for most of the region
with ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and indirect DMI. Such ordering behavior
at $T_c$ for the $S=1/2$ quantum model is corroborated by high-temperature
series expansion. To investigate the $T=0$ quantum ground states, we apply the
pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group (PFFRG). The quantum
paramagnetic phase of the pure antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model is
found to persist over a finite region in the phase diagram for both direct or
indirect DMI. We find that near the boundary of ferromagnetism and $\Gamma_5$
antiferromagnetism the system may potentially realize a quantum ground state
lacking conventional magnetic order. Otherwise, for the largest portion of the
phase diagram, PFFRG finds the same ordered phases as in the classical model.

are invaluable resources made available to the research community with the
objective of developing robust automatic speech recognition systems, they have
also been used to validate a considerable number of automatic dysarthric speech
classification approaches. Such approaches typically rely on the underlying
assumption that recordings from control and dysarthric speakers are collected
in the same noiseless environment using the same recording setup. In this
paper, we show that this assumption is violated for the UA-Speech and TORGO
databases. Using voice activity detection to extract speech and non-speech
segments, we show that the majority of state-of-the-art dysarthria
classification approaches achieve the same or a considerably better performance
when using the non-speech segments of these databases than when using the
speech segments. These results demonstrate that such approaches trained and
validated on the UA-Speech and TORGO databases are potentially learning
characteristics of the recording environment or setup rather than dysarthric
speech characteristics. We hope that these results raise awareness in the
research community about the importance of the quality of recordings when
developing and evaluating automatic dysarthria classification approaches.

emerged as a new challenge in the video instance segmentation (VIS) community.
However, existing methods have limitations in addressing this challenge. We
argue that the biggest bottleneck in current approaches is the discrepancy
between training and inference. To effectively bridge this gap, we propose a
Generalized framework for VIS, namely GenVIS, that achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks without designing complicated
architectures or requiring extra post-processing. The key contribution of
GenVIS is the learning strategy, which includes a query-based training pipeline
for sequential learning with a novel target label assignment. Additionally, we
introduce a memory that effectively acquires information from previous states.
Thanks to the new perspective, which focuses on building relationships between
separate frames or clips, GenVIS can be flexibly executed in both online and
semi-online manner. We evaluate our approach on popular VIS benchmarks,
achieving state-of-the-art results on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021/2022 and Occluded
VIS (OVIS). Notably, we greatly outperform the state-of-the-art on the long VIS
benchmark (OVIS), improving 5.6 AP with ResNet-50 backbone. Code is available

through first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-dependent
electronic transport of graphene nanoflakes with side-bonded functional groups,
contacted by atomic carbon chain electrodes. It is found that, by rotating the
functional group, the spin polarization of the transmission at the Fermi level
could be switched between completely polarized and unpolarized states.
Moreover, the transition between spin-up and spin-down polarized states can
also be achieved, operating as a dual-spin filter. Further analysis shows that,
it is the spin-dependent shift of density of states, caused by the rotation,
that triggers the shift of transmission peaks, and then results in the
variation of spin polarization. Such a feature is found to be robust to the of
the nanoflake and the electrode material, showing great application potential.
Those findings may throw light on the development of spintronic devices.

properties. On one hand we have cases like DF2 and DF4, both observed by the
Dragonfly Array Telescope, claimed to be highly-deficient in dark matter. On
the other hand, we have also observed dark matter dominated UDGs, such as DF44,
estimated to be at $99\%$ dark. Such variety of behaviors might be a problem
for both the standard dark matter paradigm and for alternative theories of
gravity. Here we consider a modified gravity theory belonging to the family of
Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar Tensor theories to study the internal kinematics
of both DF4 and DF44. The peculiarity of the chosen model is the partial
breaking of its Vaishtein screening mechanism for which it might have an
influence not only on cosmological but also on astrophysical scales. We
consider two different possibilities: one in which the model only plays the
role of dark energy; and another one in which it might also mimic a sort of
effective dark matter. We get conflicting results. For DF4 we confirm that the
galaxy dynamics might be successfully described even only by a stellar
component and that, at least at the scale which are probed, the content of dark
matter is quite low. In addition to that, we show that the DHOST model is
totally consistent with data and is statistically equivalent to a standard
General Relativity dark matter scenario, and it might even replace dark matter.
On the contrary, DF44 requires dark matter both in General Relativity and in
our DHOST model. When the latter is considered only as a cosmological dark
energy fluid, it is statistically fully reliable and equivalent to General
Relativity. But when we try to use it to substitute dark matter, although we
get good fits to the data, the constraints on the theoretical parameters are in
sharp contrast with those derived from more stringent probes from the stellar
scales.

extract a more confident pseudo label set. The images with either manual or

where speed and accuracy are equally important in terms of profits. To address

ELBERT, an innovative method to accelerate text processing on the GPU platform
is developed, solving the difficult problem of making the early exit mechanism
work more effectively with a large input batch size. Afterward, a fast and
high-accuracy FSA system is built. Experimental results show that the proposed
CWB early exit mechanism achieves significantly higher accuracy than existing
early exit methods on BERT under the same computation cost. By using this
acceleration method, our FSA system can boost the processing speed by nearly 40
times to over 1000 texts per second with sufficient accuracy, which is nearly
twice as fast as FastBERT, thus providing a more powerful text processing
capability for modern trading systems.

augmentation is regarded as a promising approach, which borrows methods from
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), for instance, perturbation on speed and
pitch, or generating emotional speech utilizing generative adversarial
networks. In this paper, we propose EmoAug, a novel style transfer model to
augment emotion expressions, in which a semantic encoder and a paralinguistic
encoder represent verbal and non-verbal information respectively. Additionally,
a decoder reconstructs speech signals by conditioning on the aforementioned two
information flows in an unsupervised fashion. Once training is completed,
EmoAug enriches expressions of emotional speech in different prosodic
attributes, such as stress, rhythm and intensity, by feeding different styles
into the paralinguistic encoder. In addition, we can also generate similar
numbers of samples for each class to tackle the data imbalance issue.
Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that EmoAug can
successfully transfer different speaking styles while retaining the speaker
identity and semantic content. Furthermore, we train a SER model with data
augmented by EmoAug and show that it not only surpasses the state-of-the-art
supervised and self-supervised methods but also overcomes overfitting problems
caused by data imbalance. Some audio samples can be found on our demo website.

~100,000 white dwarfs (WDs) that, together with the excellent photometry and
astrometry, represent an unrivalled benchmark for the study of this population.
In this work, we first built a highly-complete volume-limited sample consisting
in 12,718 WDs within 100 pc from the Sun. The use of VOSA tool allowed us to
perform an automated fitting of their spectral energy distributions to
different atmospheric models. In particular, the use of spectrally derived
J-PAS photometry from Gaia spectra led to the classification of DA and non-DA
WDs with an accuracy >90%, tested in already spectroscopically labelled
objects. The excellent performance achieved was extended to practically the
whole population of WDs with effective temperatures above 5500 K. Our results
show that, while the A branch of the Gaia WD Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is
practically populated by DA WDs, the B branch is largely formed by non-DAs
(65%). The remaining 35% of DAs within the B branch implies a second peak at
~0.8 Mo in the DA-mass distribution. Additionally, the Q branch and its
extension to lower temperatures can be observed for both DA and non-DA objects
due to core crystallisation. Finally, we derived a detailed spectral evolution
function, which confirms a slow increase of the fraction of non-DAs as the
effective temperature decreases down to 10,500 K, where it reaches a maximum of
36% and then decreases for lower temperatures down to ~31%.

modern quantum technologies. States with small coherence can be obtained either
autonomously, due to the effect of a weak coherent drive or, potentially, due
to the presence of an environment. In this paper, we propose a
measurement-based protocol for quantum coherence synthesis from individual
systems (with low initial coherence) into a global (and higher) coherence of
the joint system. As an input, it uses $N$ non-interacting copies of two-level
systems (TLS), with low initial energy and coherence. These can be supplied by,
e.g., a weak external drive or can result from an interaction with a bath. This
protocol conditionally synthesizes an output state with higher energy and
coherence than the initial state had, representing an universal process whose
rules have not been well studied, yet. In addition to energy and coherence, we
study the quantity called mutual coherence, showing increase after the protocol
application, as well. This approach is based on application of sequential
pairwise projective measurements on TLS pairs (conditionally removing their
ground states), that are diagonal in the TLS energy basis. The functionality of
the coherence synthesis is robust with respect to dephasing effects of the TLS
environment on the system. Our approach may show its benefits in quantum
sensing, quantum batteries charging, or other applications where synthesis of a
larger coherent system from smaller (weaker) resources is useful.

performance in the target domain under distribution shifts from the source

domain discriminator to match the feature distributions. Some recent methods
evaluate the discrepancy between two predictions on target samples to detect
those that deviate from the source distribution. However, their performance is

rich resource for understanding the complex mechanisms of graft failure after

might strongly confound graft failures, Cox models stratified by centers can
eliminate their confounding effects. Also, since recipient age is a proven
non-modifiable risk factor, a common practice is to fit models separately by
recipient age groups. The moderate sample sizes, relative to the number of
covariates, in some age groups may lead to biased maximum stratified partial
likelihood estimates and unreliable confidence intervals even when samples
still outnumber covariates. To draw reliable inference on a comprehensive list
of risk factors measured from both donors and recipients in SRTR, we propose a
de-biased lasso approach via quadratic programming for fitting stratified Cox
models. We establish asymptotic properties and verify via simulations that our
method produces consistent estimates and confidence intervals with nominal
coverage probabilities. Accounting for nearly 100 confounders in SRTR, the
de-biased method detects that the graft failure hazard nonlinearly increases
with donor's age among all recipient age groups, and that organs from older
donors more adversely impact the younger recipients. Our method also delineates

predicting elastic and plastic properties of a three-dimensional Representative
Volume Element (RVE) is proposed in this research. A body with randomly
distributed rough penny-shaped microcracks is considered for the first time in
which the distribution of cracks is included through different well-known
statistical distributions. Initially, the solution for a rough cohesive
penny-shaped crack is developed, and the relationship between crack nominal
length and roughness is derived. Consequently, Crack Opening Displacement (COD)
and the corresponding volume crack opening are calculated as a function of
surface roughness. Next, the SMSSC is used to study the effects of nominal
crack length distribution on a fractured medium's mechanical properties with a
known statistical distribution of crack sizes. This is done by determining the
energy release and evaluating its share in material degradation (elastic,
plastic). The elastic properties calculated using SMSSC indicated that the
fractality of crack trajectories leads to lower values of volume crack opening
and, consequently, resulted in a lower level of stiffness degradation compared
with previous smooth crack approximations. It is also reached that the
statistical distribution of rough cracks influences the mechanical properties
due to the interrelation between length and roughness. Regarding the plastic
behavior, the proposed micromechanical methodology is implemented to construct
a capped pressure-sensitive yielding potential function that explicitly
highlights the influence of crack size statistical distribution on the yielding
of cracked solids. It is evident that the statistical distribution of crack
sizes which are interrelated with crack roughness, can significantly alter the
corresponding yield surface of fractured media.

BLEs is found to be extended over the galaxy and not confined to their central

vision representation pre-training. By reconstructing masked image patches from
a small portion of visible image regions, MAE forces the model to infer
semantic correlation within an image. Recently, some approaches apply
semantic-rich teacher models to extract image features as the reconstruction
target, leading to better performance. However, unlike the low-level features
such as pixel values, we argue the features extracted by powerful teacher
models already encode rich semantic correlation across regions in an intact

Modeling (MIM) with a teacher model? In this paper, we propose an efficient MIM
paradigm named MaskAlign. MaskAlign simply learns the consistency of visible
patch features extracted by the student model and intact image features
extracted by the teacher model. To further advance the performance and tackle
the problem of input inconsistency between the student and teacher model, we
propose a Dynamic Alignment (DA) module to apply learnable alignment. Our

Dynamic Alignment, MaskAlign can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much

  Attention for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) is a transfer learning task where the data
and annotations of the source domain are available but only have access to the
unlabeled target data during training. Most previous methods try to minimise
the domain gap by performing distribution alignment between the source and
target domains, which has a notable limitation, i.e., operating at the domain
level, but neglecting the sample-level differences. To mitigate this weakness,
we propose to improve the unsupervised domain adaptation task with an
inter-domain sample matching scheme. We apply the widely-used and robust
Triplet loss to match the inter-domain samples. To reduce the catastrophic
effect of the inaccurate pseudo-labels generated during training, we propose a
novel uncertainty measurement method to select reliable pseudo-labels
automatically and progressively refine them. We apply the advanced discrete
relaxation Gumbel Softmax technique to realise an adaptive Topk scheme to
fulfil the functionality. In addition, to enable the global ranking
optimisation within one batch for the domain matching, the whole model is
optimised via a novel reinforced attention mechanism with supervision from the
policy gradient algorithm, using the Average Precision (AP) as the reward. Our
model (termed \textbf{\textit{AdaTriplet-RA}}) achieves State-of-the-art
results on several public benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is
validated via comprehensive ablation studies. Our method improves the accuracy
of the baseline by 9.7\% (ResNet-101) and 6.2\% (ResNet-50) on the VisDa

a two-dimensional parameter space elucidates the existence of exceptional

they are topologically protected only in non-interacting cases. This fragility
of exceptional points and symmetry-protected exceptional rings arises from the
reduction of non-Hermitian topological classifications, which is elucidated by
introducing topological invariants of the second-quantized Hamiltonian for both
non-interacting and interacting cases. These topological invariants are also
available to analyze the reduction phenomena of gapped systems. The above

approximate a solution for a new parameter value (e.g. real time approximation
with a very high accuracy). They intend to reduce the computational costs of
High Fidelity (HF) codes. We will focus on the Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis
(NIRB) two-grid method. Its main advantage is that it uses the HF code
exclusively as a ""black-box,"" as opposed to other so-called intrusive methods
that require code modification. This is very convenient when the HF code is a
commercial one that has been purchased, as is frequently the case in the
industry. The effectiveness of this method relies on its decomposition into two
stages, one offline (classical in most RBMs as presented above) and one online.
The offline part is time-consuming but it is only performed once. On the
contrary, the specificity of this NIRB approach is that, during the online
part, it solves the parametric problem on a coarse mesh only and then improves
its precision. As a result, it is significantly less expensive than a HF
evaluation. This method has been originally developed for elliptic equations
with finite elements and has since been extended to finite volume. In this

optimal estimates in $L^{\infty}(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$ using as a model problem,

re-balancing of available bikes according to predicted demand. Existing methods
for bike sharing demand prediction are mostly based on its own historical
demand variation, essentially regarding it as a closed system and neglecting
the interaction between different transportation modes. This is particularly
important for bike sharing because it is often used to complement travel
through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite some recent progress, no
existing method is capable of leveraging spatiotemporal information from
multiple modes and explicitly considers the distribution discrepancy between
them, which can easily lead to negative transfer. To address these challenges,
this study proposes a domain-adversarial multi-relational graph neural network
(DA-MRGNN) for bike sharing demand prediction with multimodal historical data
as input. A temporal adversarial adaptation network is introduced to extract
shareable features from demand patterns of different modes. To capture
correlations between spatial units across modes, we adapt a multi-relational
graph neural network (MRGNN) considering both cross-mode similarity and
difference. In addition, an explainable GNN technique is developed to
understand how our proposed model makes predictions. Extensive experiments are
conducted using real-world bike sharing, subway and ride-hailing data from New
York City. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
approach compared to existing methods and the effectiveness of different model

via comparing point cloud data against a pretrained model that ensures the
consistency of photometric loss. The scale-ambiguity problem is solved by
introducing a novel two-stages coarse-to-fine scale recovery strategy that
jointly refines coarse poses and depths. Our model successfully produces pose

and industry. Due to the lack of anomalous data in many practical cases, AD is
usually solved by first modeling the normal data pattern and then determining
if data fit this model. Generative models (GMs) seem a natural tool to achieve
this purpose, which learn the normal data distribution and estimate it using a
probability density function (PDF). However, some works have observed the ideal
performance of such GM-based AD methods. In this paper, we propose a new
perspective on the ideal performance of GM-based AD methods. We state that in
these methods, the implicit assumption that connects GMs'results to AD's goal
is usually implausible due to normal data's multi-peaked distribution
characteristic, which is quite common in practical cases. We first
qualitatively formulate this perspective, and then focus on the Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) to intuitively illustrate the perspective, which is a
typical GM and has the natural property to approximate multi-peaked
distributions. Based on the proposed perspective, in order to bypass the
implicit assumption in the GMM-based AD method, we suggest integrating the
Discriminative idea to orient GMM to AD tasks (DiGMM). With DiGMM, we establish
a connection of generative and discriminative models, which are two key
paradigms for AD and are usually treated separately before. This connection
provides a possible direction for future works to jointly consider the two
paradigms and incorporate their complementary characteristics for AD.

of mass accretion and energy amplification. The contribution of the magnetic
field due to the magnetic polarization of the material induces effects on the
physical properties of the medium that have repercussions on the radiation
coming from the accretion disks. Hence, from observations, it could be possible
to infer the ""fingerprint"" left by the magnetic polarization of the material
and establish the properties of the spacetime itself. As the first step in this
purpose, we use numerical simulations to systematically analyze the possible
observable effects produced by the magnetic properties of an accretion disk
around a Kerr black hole. We found that under the synchrotron radiation
power-law model the effects of the magnetic polarization are negligible when
the plasma is gas pressure-dominated. Nevertheless, as beta-plasma decreases,
the emission becomes more intense for magnetic pressure-dominated disks. In
particular, we found that paramagnetic disks emit the highest intensity value
independent of the beta-plasma parameter in this regime. By contrast, the
emitted flux decreases with the increase of beta-plasma due to the dependence
of the magnetic field on the emission and absorption coefficients. Moreover,
the disk morphology changes with the magnetic susceptibility: paramagnetic
disks are more compact than diamagnetic ones. This fact leads to diamagnetic
disks emitting a greater flux because each photon has a more optical path to
travel inside the disk.

dual class-aware contrastive module, DCCFSSL establishes a unified training
objective for different clients to tackle large deviations and incorporates
contrastive information in the feature space to mitigate confirmation bias.
Moreover, DCCFSSL introduces an authentication-reweighted aggregation technique
to improve the server's aggregation robustness. Our comprehensive experiments
show that DCCFSSL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on three
benchmark datasets and surpasses the FedAvg with relabeled unlabeled clients on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets. To our knowledge, we are the first to
present an FSSL method that utilizes only 10\% labeled clients, while still
achieving superior performance compared to standard federated supervised
learning, which uses all clients with labeled data.

diodes (OLEDs) has aroused considerable attention for their potential in future
display and photonic technologies. The development of CP-OLEDs relies largely
on chiral-emitters, which not only remain rare owing to difficulties in design
and synthesis but also limit the performance of electroluminescence. When the
polarization (pseudospin) degrees of freedom of a photon interact with its
orbital angular momentum, photonic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) emerges such as
Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) effect. Here, we demonstrate a chiral-emitter-free
microcavity CP-OLED with a high dissymmetry factor (gEL) and high luminance by
embedding a thin two-dimensional organic single crystal (2D-OSC) between two
silver layers which serve as two metallic mirrors forming a microcavity and
meanwhile also as two electrodes in an OLED architecture. In the presence of
the RD effect, the SOIs in the birefringent 2D-OSC microcavity result in a
controllable spin-splitting with CP dispersions. Thanks to the high emission
efficiency and high carrier mobility of the OSC, chiral-emitter-free CP-OLEDs
have been demonstrated exhibiting a high gEL of 1.1 and a maximum luminance of
about 60000 cd/m2, which places our device among the best performing CP-OLEDs.
This strategy opens a new avenue for practical applications towards on-chip
microcavity CP-OLEDs.

three-dimensional microwave cavity containing two yttrium iron garnet (YIG)
spheres, where the two magnon modes (one has the MKN, while the other is
linear) in YIG spheres are simultaneously coupled to microwave photons. To
obtain the effective gain of the cavity mode, we feed two input fields into the
cavity. By choosing appropriate parameters, the coherent perfect absorption of
the two input fields occurs, and the cavity-magnon system can be described by
an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Under the pseudo-Hermitian conditions,
the effective Hamiltonian can host the third-order exceptional point (EP3),
where the three eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian coalesce into one. When the
magnon frequency shift $\Delta_K$ induced by the MKN is much smaller than the
linewidths $\Gamma$ of the peaks in the transmission spectrum of the cavity
(i.e., $\Delta_K\ll \Gamma$), the magnon frequency shift can be amplified by
the EP3, which can be probed via the output spectrum of the cavity. The scheme
we present provides an alternative approach to measure the MKN in the region
$\Delta_K\ll \Gamma$ and has potential applications in designing low-power
nonlinear devices based on the MKN.

majority of atoms are strongly caged by their neighbors, but a tiny fraction
has a very high propensity for rearrangement, which leads to a power-law
variation in the cage-breaking probability for the atoms in the model. In
addition, atoms generally have multiple accessible rearrangement vectors, each

first-order derivative equations of motion and thus avoid the typical
instabilities of CS gravity in the metric formalism. As an initial application,
we analyze the cosmological propagation of gravitational waves (GWs) in
Palatini CS gravity. We show that, due to parity breaking, the polarizations of
GWs suffer two effects during propagation: amplitude birefringence (which
changes the polarization ellipticity) and velocity birefringence (which rotates
the polarization plane). While amplitude birefringence is known to be present
in CS gravity in the metric formalism, velocity birefringence is not present in
metric CS gravity, but now appears in Palatini CS due to the fact that
left-handed and right-handed GW polarizations have a different dispersion
relation. In the approximation of small deviations from General Relativity
(GR), we do find however that velocity birefringence appears at least
quadratically in the CS coupling parameter $\alpha$, while amplitude
birefringence appears linearly in $\alpha$. This means that amplitude
birefringence will be the most relevant effect in Palatini CS and hence this
model will behave similarly to metric CS. We confirm this by applying current
constraints on amplitude and velocity birefringence to Palatini CS, and showing
that those from amplitude birefringence give the tightest bounds.

varying timescales (1.6~ns for PUMA, 9.7~ns for the previously studied BIM, and
85~ns for NOXA). These differences are interpreted as a BH3-only-specific
""structural resilience"" to defy the perturbation while remaining in MCL-1's
binding pocket. Thus, the presented insights could help to better understand
the differences between PUMA, BIM, and NOXA, the promiscuity of MCL-1 in
general, and the role of the proteins in the apoptotic network.

(APINN), which adopts soft and trainable domain decomposition and flexible
parameter sharing to further improve the extended PINN (XPINN) as well as the
vanilla PINN methods. In particular, a trainable gate network is employed to
mimic the hard decomposition of XPINN, which can be flexibly fine-tuned for
discovering a potentially better partition. It weight-averages several sub-nets
as the output of APINN. APINN does not require complex interface conditions,
and its sub-nets can take advantage of all training samples rather than just
part of the training data in their subdomains. Lastly, each sub-net shares part
of the common parameters to capture the similar components in each decomposed
function. Furthermore, following the PINN generalization theory in Hu et al.
[2021], we show that APINN can improve generalization by proper gate network
initialization and general domain & function decomposition. Extensive
experiments on different types of PDEs demonstrate how APINN improves the PINN
and XPINN methods. Specifically, we present examples where XPINN performs
similarly to or worse than PINN, so that APINN can significantly improve both.
We also show cases where XPINN is already better than PINN, so APINN can still
slightly improve XPINN. Furthermore, we visualize the optimized gating networks
and their optimization trajectories, and connect them with their performance,
which helps discover the possibly optimal decomposition. Interestingly, if
initialized by different decomposition, the performances of corresponding
APINNs can differ drastically. This, in turn, shows the potential to design an
optimal domain decomposition for the differential equation problem under

inverted ensemble of two-level atoms. There, the atoms emit light in the form
of a short, intense burst due to a spontaneous synchronization of the atomic
dipoles. Typically, to observe this phenomenon, the atoms must be placed in
close vicinity of each other. In contrast, here we experimentally observe
superradiant burst dynamics with a one-dimensional ensemble of atoms that
extends over thousands of optical wavelengths. This is enabled by coupling the
atoms to a nanophotonic waveguide, which mediates long-range dipole-dipole
interactions between the emitters. The burst occurs above a threshold atom
number, and its peak power scales faster with the number of atoms than in the
case of standard Dicke superradiance. Moreover, we study the coherence
properties of the burst and observe a sharp transition between two regimes: in
the first, the phase coherence between the atoms is seeded by the excitation
laser. In the second, it is seeded by vacuum fluctuations. Our results shed
light on the collective radiative dynamics of spatially extended ensembles of

increasing attention from both the security and the privacy communities. One
important yet worrying question is: will training models under the differential

previous works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse
robustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can
indeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their
naturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that
influence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyperparameters for DP
optimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly
mitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a
difference. With these factors set properly, we achieve 90\% natural accuracy,
72\% robust accuracy ($+9\%$ than the non-private model) under $l_2(0.5)$
attack, and 69\% robust accuracy ($+16\%$ than the non-private model) with
pre-trained SimCLRv2 model under $l_\infty(4/255)$ attack on CIFAR10 with
$\epsilon=2$. In fact, we show both theoretically and empirically that DP
models are Pareto optimal on the accuracy-robustness tradeoff. Empirically, the
robustness of DP models is consistently observed on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and
CelebA datasets, with ResNet and Vision Transformer. We believe our encouraging
results are a significant step towards training models that are private as well

that correspond to the degraded input. In this paper we reveal additional
fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which
further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that
attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the
input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic.
Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may
attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the
space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which
makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that
enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders
their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly
influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability.
These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic
restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms.

situation where the magnetic disc wind can be launched from the disc. Second,
we model 1D steady CPDs consistent with the results of the MHD simulations and
calculate the steady radial distributions of the dust profiles in the modeled

satellitesimals can form in such CPDs if the dust-to-gas mass ratio of the

outflows launched from the inner parts of the accretion disc. The outflows
affect the apparent luminosity of the XRPs and their pulsations through the
geometrical beaming. We model processes of geometrical beaming and pulse
formation using Monte Carlo simulations. We confirm our earlier statement that
strong amplification of luminosity due to the collimation of X-ray photons is
inconsistent with a large pulsed fraction. Accounting for relativistic
aberration due to possibly high outflow velocity ($\sim 0.2c$) does not affect
this conclusion. We demonstrate that the beaming causes phase lags of
pulsations. Within the opening angle of the accretion cavity formed by the
outflows, phase lags tend to be sensitive to observers viewing angles.

might influence the detectability of pulsation in bright X-ray pulsars and
ULXs. We speculate that the strong geometrical beaming is associated with large
radiation pressure on the walls of accretion cavity due to multiple photons
reflections. We expect that the mass loss rate limits geometrical beaming:
strong beaming becomes possible only under sufficiently large fractional mass
loss rate from the disc.

diffusion across the Galaxy, the heliosphere, and its interplay with the
ambient magnetic field. This diffusion term contributes to the highly stiff
nature of the CR transport equation. In order to conduct numerical simulations
of time-dependent cosmic ray transport, implicit integrators have been
traditionally favoured over the CFL-bound explicit integrators in order to be
able to take large step sizes. We propose exponential methods that directly
compute the exponential of the matrix to solve the linear anisotropic diffusion
equation. These methods allow us to take even larger step sizes; in certain
cases, we are able to choose a step size as large as the simulation time, i.e.,
only one time step. This can substantially speed-up the simulations whilst
generating highly accurate solutions (l2 error $\leq 10^{-10}$). Additionally,
we test an approach based on extracting a constant diffusion coefficient from
the anisotropic diffusion equation, where the constant coefficient term is
solved implicitly or exponentially and the remainder is treated using some
explicit method. We find that this approach, for homogeneous linear problems,
is unable to improve on the exponential-based methods that directly evaluate
the matrix exponential.

using fingerspelling in British Sign Language (BSL). Previous fingerspelling
recognition methods have not focused on BSL, which has a very different signing
alphabet (e.g., two-handed instead of one-handed) to American Sign Language
(ASL). They also use manual annotations for training. In contrast to previous
methods, our method only uses weak annotations from subtitles for training. We
localize potential instances of fingerspelling using a simple feature
similarity method, then automatically annotate these instances by querying
subtitle words and searching for corresponding mouthing cues from the signer.
We propose a Transformer architecture adapted to this task, with a
multiple-hypothesis CTC loss function to learn from alternative annotation
possibilities. We employ a multi-stage training approach, where we make use of
an initial version of our trained model to extend and enhance our training data
before re-training again to achieve better performance. Through extensive
evaluations, we verify our method for automatic annotation and our model
architecture. Moreover, we provide a human expert annotated test set of 5K

  hardening behavior of quenched martensitic steels",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The onset of plasticity in quenched martensitic microstructures is
characterized by a low initial yield stress followed by an extremely strong
initial hardening response, and then a sudden hardening saturation. Literature
attributes this behavior to residual stresses and dislocations inherited from
the martensitic transformation, or to microstructural heterogeneities causing
strength differences among the grains. Here, we argue that
orientation-dependent yielding of lath martensite due to inter-lath sliding,
which induces a substructure boundary sliding mechanism, may also contribute
significantly to the observed behavior. To demonstrate this, we systematically
study its quantitative contribution to the elasto-plastic transition behavior
in a numerical microstructural model. In the simulations, we employ an
effective laminate model for the martensite packets which takes into account
the yielding anisotropy due to sliding along the packet's habit plane
orientation. To account for the effect of carbon content, martensitic
microstructures with different levels of lath strength are considered. It is
shown that the martensite packets with a favorable habit plane orientation
start to yield earlier compared to those with an unfavorable orientation, which
initially remain elastic. As a consequence, the macro-scale response of the
microstructures exhibits a low yield stress, followed by a significant degree
of initial hardening which continues until the saturation stress level is
approached. The apparent work hardening rate depends on the contrast between
the in-habit plane and out-of-habit plane yield strength used in the model.

the price signals, while the architecture is designed following a micro-service
approach, enabling modularity and loose-coupling. The evaluation shows that
including local energy storage as part of the optimization problem further

complex allow to observe high energy gamma radiation helping to study many
astrophysical objects and processes. TAIGA-IACT enables us to select gamma
quanta from the total cosmic radiation flux and recover their primary
parameters, such as energy and direction of arrival. The traditional method of
processing the resulting images is an image parameterization - so-called the
Hillas parameters method. At the present time Machine Learning methods, in
particular Deep Learning methods have become actively used for IACT image
processing. This paper presents the analysis of simulated Monte Carlo images by
several Deep Learning methods for a single telescope (mono-mode) and multiple
IACT telescopes (stereo-mode). The estimation of the quality of energy
reconstruction was carried out and their energy spectra were analyzed using
several types of neural networks. Using the developed methods the obtained
results were also compared with the results obtained by traditional methods
based on the Hillas parameters.

possible. For this purpose, we introduce a community-preserving message passing

by modularity-based clustering, we further propose novel training and

  inequalities in section 2.8. Submitted, comments still welcome",,,,"math.NT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper is concerned with the relationship of $y$-friable (i.e.
$y$-smooth) integers and the Dickman function. Under the Riemann Hypothesis
(RH), an asymptotic formula for the count of $y$-friable integers up to $x$,
$\Psi(x,y)$, in terms of the Dickman function was previously available only for
$y \ge (\log x)^{2+\varepsilon}$, by works of Hildebrand and Saias.
Unconditionally we establish an asymptotic formula for $\Psi(x,y)$ in the wider
range $y \ge (1+\varepsilon)\log x$, whose shape is $x \rho(\log x/\log y)$
times correction factors. These factors take into account the contributions of
zeta zeros and prime powers. With this formula at hand, we resolve two
questions of Hildebrand and Pomerance.
  Hildebrand conjectured that $\Psi(x,y)$ is not $\asymp x \rho(\log x/\log y)$
once $y$ is smaller than $(\log x)^{2+\varepsilon}$, and we show
unconditionally he was correct.
  Pomerance asked whether the inequality $\Psi(x,y)\ge x \rho(\log x/ \log y)$
holds for $x/2 \ge y \ge 2$. If RH is false we show this fails infinitely
often. When RH is true, the inequality holds for $x/2\ge y\ge 2$, $x \gg 1$
except possibly for $y$ close to the critical point $y=(\log x)^2$. Near this
point, the question is essentially equivalent to \[ \liminf_{y \to \infty}
\frac{\psi(y)-y}{\log y \sqrt{y} } > L\] for a constant $L\approx -0.666217$,
where $\psi$ is the Chebyshev function. It is expected that this limit is $0$,
but even under RH we cannot rule out that it is $-\infty$.
  As another consequence of our formula, we show that under RH $\Psi(x,y)$
exhibits an unexpected phase transition when $y \approx (\log x)^{3/2}$. We
also improve old inequalities for $\Psi(x,y)$.

studied as a function of the produced particle multiplicity to identify
evidence for longitudinal broadening that might reveal the presence of viscous

been attracting a growing amount of attention in recent years, with emphasis on
designing efficient strategies where the agents operate in a decentralized and
symmetric manner with guaranteed convergence. While significant efforts have
been made in understanding zero-sum two-player matrix games, the performance in
zero-sum multi-agent games remains inadequately explored, especially in the
presence of delayed feedbacks, leaving the scalability and resiliency of
gradient play open to questions.
  In this paper, we make progress by studying asynchronous gradient plays in
zero-sum polymatrix games under delayed feedbacks. We first establish that the
last iterate of entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weight updates
(OMWU) method converges linearly to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), the
solution concept under bounded rationality, in the absence of delays. While the
linear convergence continues to hold even when the feedbacks are randomly
delayed under mild statistical assumptions, it converges at a noticeably slower
rate due to a smaller tolerable range of learning rates. Moving beyond, we
demonstrate entropy-regularized OMWU -- by adopting two-timescale learning
rates in a delay-aware manner -- enjoys faster last-iterate convergence under
fixed delays, and continues to converge provably even when the delays are
arbitrarily bounded in an average-iterate manner. Our methods also lead to
finite-time guarantees to approximate the Nash equilibrium (NE) by moderating
the amount of regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first that aims to understand asynchronous gradient play in zero-sum polymatrix
games under a wide range of delay assumptions, highlighting the role of
learning rates separation.

submillimeter polarimetry of the dust continuum at $\lambda$= 850 $\mu$m and
450 $\mu$m using the POL-2 polarimeter situated in front of the SCUBA-2
submillimeter bolometer camera on James Clerk Maxwell Tetescope. This was
compared with millimeter polarimetry taken at $\lambda$= 3.3 mm with ALMA. The
magnetic field was detected at $\lambda$= 850 $\mu$m in the peripheral region,
which is threaded in a north-south direction, while the central region traced
at $\lambda$= 450 $\mu$m shows a magnetic field with an east-west direction,
i.e., orthogonal to that of the peripheral region. Magnetic field strengths are
estimated to be $\sim$70 $\mu$G and 200 $\mu$G in the peripheral- and
central-regions, respectively, using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The
resulting mass-to-flux ratio of 3 times larger than that of magnetically
critical state for both regions indicates that L1521 F is magnetically
supercritical, i.e., gravitational forces dominate over magnetic turbulence

immediately reflect on the feedback and spreads its effects over a long time
frame. For instance, in online advertising, investing in a platform produces an
instantaneous increase of awareness, but the actual reward, i.e., a conversion,
might occur far in the future. Furthermore, whether a conversion takes place
depends on: how fast the awareness grows, its vanishing effects, and the
synergy or interference with other advertising platforms. Previous work has
investigated the Multi-Armed Bandit framework with the possibility of delayed
and aggregated feedback, without a particular structure on how an action
propagates in the future, disregarding possible dynamical effects. In this
paper, we introduce a novel setting, the Dynamical Linear Bandits (DLB), an
extension of the linear bandits characterized by a hidden state. When an action
is performed, the learner observes a noisy reward whose mean is a linear
function of the hidden state and of the action. Then, the hidden state evolves
according to linear dynamics, affected by the performed action too. We start by
introducing the setting, discussing the notion of optimal policy, and deriving
an expected regret lower bound. Then, we provide an optimistic regret
minimization algorithm, Dynamical Linear Upper Confidence Bound (DynLin-UCB),
that suffers an expected regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \Big( \frac{d

historical data, with three main innovations: (i) the weight of pooling ties
directly to the performance of decision (measured by regret) as opposed to
estimation accuracy in conventional methods; (ii) no parametric assumptions are
needed between historical and current data; and (iii) requiring data-sharing
only via aggregate statistics, as opposed to patient-level data. Our
data-pooling algorithm framework applies to a variety of popular RL algorithms,

better performance of our algorithm via a case study in the context of
post-discharge intervention to prevent unplanned readmissions, generating
practical insights for healthcare management. In particular, our algorithm
alleviates privacy concerns about sharing health data, which (i) opens the door

most common occupational health injuries and causes severe and often chronic
nerve and vascular injury to the operator. Machines emitting shock vibrations,
e.g., impact wrenches have since long been identified as a special risk factor.
In legislative and standard texts the terms shock, impact, and transient
vibration are frequently used to underline the special risk associated with
these kinds of vibrations. In spite of this, there is no mathematically
stringent definition what a shock vibration is or how the amplitude of the
shock is defined. This lack of definitions is the subject of this article. This
document discusses a number of candidate definitions for a vibration shock
index (VSI) that quantifies different vibration signals in terms of how
localized they are in the time domain. The VSI is intended to be used to
classify and compare different vibration sources. The VSI is independent of the
vibration level, i.e., it is unchanged if the vibration signal is rescaled. The
traditional root mean square method to determine the vibration level will not
produce a value representative for the shocks occurring in a signal with high
VSI. Thus, there is a need for a complementing quantification method for the
localized signal parts. Possible definitions for such a vibration shock level
(VSL) are suggested. A problem formulation is first stated together with a
description of the approach used for designing the VSI and the VSL. After this,
model signals are defined, which are used to discuss and evaluate the different
candidate definitions. Then, a number of candidate definitions are discussed,
leading up to a conclusion on which candidate definitions that are promising

expansion and rotation. At the same time, we observe the collapse and
coalescence of two substructures in a region where active star formation is
taking place. The fraction of stars with disks and of those undergoing
circumstellar accretion varies significantly across the field, suggesting that
star formation has been occurring for several million years. A particularly low
disk fraction around the O VII star S Mon might be attributed to external disk
photoevaporation or to an older age of the stars in the region.
  NGC2264 is not dynamically relaxed and its present configuration is the
result of multiple dynamical processes. The cloud has been forming stars for
several million years and we identify the process that is likely responsible
for the ongoing formation activity.

from being basic tools to socially intelligent agents working alongside humans
towards common goals. In such scenarios, the ability to predict future behavior

agent. Goal-oriented human behavior is complex, hierarchical, and unfolds
across multiple timescales. Despite this observation, relatively little
attention has been paid towards using multi-timescale features to model such

behavioral information at multiple timescales to predict future behavior. We
demonstrate that our approach for modeling behavior in multiple timescales
substantially improves prediction of future behavior compared to methods that
do not model behavior at multiple timescales. We evaluate our architecture on

cellular automata, with fermionic occupation numbers associated to bits. We
construct an automaton that represents a discrete model of spinor gravity in
four dimensions. Local Lorentz symmetry is exact on the discrete level and
diffeomorphism symmetry emerges in the naive continuum limit. Our setting could
serve as a model for quantum gravity if diffeomorphism symmetry is realized in
the true continuum limit and suitable collective fields for vierbein and metric
acquire nonvanishing expectation values. The discussion of this interesting
specific model reveals may key qualitative features of the continuum limit for
probabilistic cellular automata. This limit obtains for a very large number of
cells if the probabilistic information is sufficiently smooth. It is associated
to coarse graining. The automaton property that every bit configuration is
updated at every discrete time step to precisely one new bit configuration does
no longer hold on the coarse grained level. A coarse grained configuration of
occupation numbers can evolve into many different configurations with certain
probabilities. This characteristic feature of quantum field theories can come
along with the emergence of continuous space-time symmetries.

algorithms that are able to quickly solve large problem instances to
optimality. This prompted researchers to also investigate whether relatively
small problem instances exist that are hard for existing solvers and
investigate which features characterize their hardness. Previously the authors
proposed a new class of hard 0-1 knapsack problem instances and demonstrated
that the properties of so-called inclusionwise maximal solutions (IMSs) can be
important hardness indicators for this class. In the current paper, we
formulate several new computationally challenging problems related to the IMSs
of arbitrary 0-1 knapsack problem instances. Based on generalizations of
previous work and new structural results about IMSs, we formulate polynomial
and pseudopolynomial time algorithms for solving these problems. From this we
derive a set of 14 computationally expensive features, which we calculate for
two large datasets on a supercomputer in approximately 540 CPU-hours. We show
that the proposed features contain important information related to the
empirical hardness of a problem instance that was missing in earlier features
from the literature by training machine learning models that can accurately
predict the empirical hardness of a wide variety of 0-1 knapsack problem
instances. Using the instance space analysis methodology, we also show that
hard 0-1 knapsack problem instances are clustered together around a relatively
dense region of the instance space and several features behave differently in
the easy and hard parts of the instance space.

on the likelihood of forming intermediate-mass (IM) and supermassive (SM) black
holes (BHs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) through successive BH mergers,
initiated with a single BH seed. Using observationally motivated NSC profiles,
we find that the probability of a ${\sim}100 \, M_\odot$ BH to grow beyond
${\sim}1000 \, M_\odot$ through successive mergers ranges from ${\sim}0.1\%$ in
low-density, low-mass clusters to nearly $90\%$ in high-mass, high-density
clusters. However, in the most massive NSCs, the growth timescale can be very
long ($\gtrsim 1\,$Gyr); vice versa, while growth is least likely in less
massive NSCs, it is faster there, requiring as little as ${\sim}0.1\,$Gyr. The
increased gravitational focusing in systems with lower velocity dispersions is
the primary contributor to this behavior. We find that there is a simple
""7-strikes-and-you're-in"" rule governing the growth of BHs: our results suggest
that if the seed survives 7 to 10 successive mergers without being ejected
(primarily through gravitational wave recoil kicks), the growing BH will most
likely remain in the cluster and will then undergo runaway, continuous growth
all the way to the formation of an SMBH (under the simplifying assumption
adopted here of a fixed background NSC). Furthermore, we find that rapid
mergers enforce a dynamically-mediated ""mass gap"" between about ${50-300 \,
M_\odot}$ in an NSC.

are offloaded to ground servers for computation, where the transmission of raw
data on satellite-to-ground links severely constrains the performance. To
overcome this limitation, recent works offload tasks to visible low-earth-orbit
(LEO) satellites. However, this offloading scheme is difficult to achieve good
performance in actual networks with uneven loads because visible satellites
over hotspots tend to be overloaded. Therefore, it is urgent to extend the
offloading targets to the entire network.
  To address the network-wide offloading problem, we propose a metagraph-based
computation and transmission fusion offloading scheme for multi-tier networks.
Specifically, virtual edges, between the original network and its duplicate,
are generated to fuse computation and transmission in single-tier networks.
Then, a metagraph is employed to integrate the fusion in multi-tier networks.
After assigning appropriate edge weights to the metagraph, the network-wide
offloading problem can be solved by searching the shortest path.
  In addition, we apply the proposed scheme to solve the spatial computation
offloading problem in a real multi-tier network. The superiority of the
proposed scheme over two benchmark schemes are proved theoretically and
empirically.
  Simulation results show that the proposed scheme decreases the weighted
average delay by up to 87.51% and 18.70% compared with the ground offloading
scheme and the visible offloading scheme, respectively.

it is still not trivial for the state-of-the-art algorithms to discover the

dimensional homogeneity constrained gene expression programming (DHC-GEP)
method is proposed. DHC-GEP discovers the forms of functions and their
corresponding coefficients simultaneously, without assuming any candidate
functions in advance. The constraint of dimensional homogeneity is capable of
filtering out the overfitting equations effectively, and physics knowledge can
be embedded via constructing special terminal sets. The key advantages of
DHC-GEP, including being robust to the hyperparameters of models, the noise
level and the size of datasets, are demonstrated on two benchmark studies.
Furthermore, DHC-GEP is employed to discover the unknown constitutive relations
of two typical non-equilibrium flows. The derived constitutive relations not
only are more accurate than the conventional ones, but also satisfy the
Galilean invariance and the second law of thermodynamics. This work
demonstrates that DHC-GEP is a general and promising tool for discovering
governing equations from noisy and scarce data in a variety of fields, such as

visual entities to describe are often underspecified. Generic image captions
often miss visual details essential for the LM to answer visual questions

only one model to achieve a high-transferability adversarial attack on multiple

probabilities. Unlike conventional models, our approach acknowledges that the
data generation process of a sequence is not deterministic, but rather
ambiguous and influenced by a set of probabilities. To capture this ambiguity,
GAMMT employs multiple parallel transformers that are linked by a selection
mechanism, allowing for the approximation of ambiguous probabilities. The
generative nature of our approach also enables multiple representations of

  Neural Network",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Improving the scalability of GNNs is critical for large graphs. Existing
methods leverage three sampling paradigms including node-wise, layer-wise and
subgraph sampling, then design unbiased estimator for scalability. However, the
high variance still severely hinders GNNs' performance. On account that
previous studies either lacks variance analysis or only focus on a particular
sampling paradigm, we firstly propose an unified node sampling variance
analysis framework and analyze the core challenge ""circular dependency"" for
deriving the minimum variance sampler, i. e., sampling probability depends on
node embeddings while node embeddings can not be calculated until sampling is
finished. Existing studies either ignore the node embeddings or introduce
external parameters, resulting in the lack of a both efficient and effective
variance reduction methods. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{H}ierarchical
\textbf{E}stimation based \textbf{S}ampling GNN (HE-SGNN) with first level
estimating the node embeddings in sampling probability to break circular
dependency, and second level employing sampling GNN operator to estimate the
nodes' representations on the entire graph. Considering the technical
difference, we propose different first level estimator, i.e., a time series
simulation for layer-wise sampling and a feature based simulation for subgraph
sampling. The experimental results on seven representative datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

notoriously complex and time-consuming simulator, the prevalent approach is to
replace these simulations with a data-driven surrogate that approximates the
simulator's behavior at a much cheaper cost. The main challenge in creating an
inexpensive data-driven surrogate is the generation of a sheer number of data
using these computationally expensive numerical simulations. In such cases,
Active Learning (AL) methods have been used that attempt to learn an
input--output behavior while labeling the fewest samples possible. The current
trend in AL for a regression problem is dominated by the Bayesian framework
that needs training an ensemble of learning models that makes surrogate
training computationally tedious if the underlying learning model is Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs). However, DNNs have an excellent capability to learn
highly nonlinear and complex relationships even for a very high dimensional
problem. To leverage the excellent learning capability of deep networks along
with avoiding the computational complexity of the Bayesian paradigm, in this
work we propose a simple and scalable approach for active learning that works
in a student-teacher manner to train a surrogate model. By using this proposed
approach, we are able to achieve the same level of surrogate accuracy as the
other baselines like DBAL and Monte Carlo sampling with up to 40 % fewer
samples. We empirically evaluated this method on multiple use cases including
three different engineering design domains:finite element analysis,
computational fluid dynamics, and propeller design.

embedding requires choosing values for the delay $\tau$ and the dimension $m$.
Both parameters are critical to the success of the procedure and neither is
easy to formally validate. While embedding theorems do offer formal guidance
for these choices, in practice one has to resort to heuristics, such as the
average mutual information (AMI) method of Fraser & Swinney for $\tau$ or the
false near neighbor (FNN) method of Kennel et al. for $m$. Best practice
suggests an iterative approach: one of these heuristics is used to make a good
first guess for the corresponding free parameter and then an ""asymptotic
invariant"" approach is then used to firm up its value by, e.g., computing the
correlation dimension or Lyapunov exponent for a range of values and looking
for convergence. This process can be subjective, as these computations often
involve finding, and fitting a line to, a scaling region in a plot: a process
that is generally done by eye and is not immune to confirmation bias. Moreover,
most of these heuristics do not provide confidence intervals, making it
difficult to say what ""convergence"" is. Here, we propose an approach that
automates the first step, removing the subjectivity, and formalizes the second,
offering a statistical test for convergence. Our approach rests upon a recently
developed method for automated scaling-region selection that includes
confidence intervals on the results. We demonstrate this methodology by
selecting values for the embedding dimension for several real and simulated
dynamical systems. We compare these results to those produced by FNN and
validate them against known results -- e.g., of the correlation dimension --
where these are available. We note that this method extends to any free
parameter in the theory or practice of delay reconstruction.

such as the choice of learning protocol, metric of success and data needed to
validate research hypotheses. In this work, we introduce the Never-Ending
VIsual-classification Stream (NEVIS'22), a benchmark consisting of a stream of
over 100 visual classification tasks, sorted chronologically and extracted from
papers sampled uniformly from computer vision proceedings spanning the last
three decades. The resulting stream reflects what the research community
thought was meaningful at any point in time, and it serves as an ideal test bed
to assess how well models can adapt to new tasks, and do so better and more
efficiently as time goes by. Despite being limited to classification, the
resulting stream has a rich diversity of tasks from OCR, to texture analysis,
scene recognition, and so forth. The diversity is also reflected in the wide
range of dataset sizes, spanning over four orders of magnitude. Overall,
NEVIS'22 poses an unprecedented challenge for current sequential learning
approaches due to the scale and diversity of tasks, yet with a low entry

CDialog dataset to advance future research on developing automated medical
dialog systems. We use pre-trained language models for dialogue generation,
incorporating annotated medical entities, to generate a virtual doctor's
response that addresses the patient's query. Experimental results show that the
proposed dialog models perform comparably better when supplemented with entity
information and hence can improve the response quality.

  University of Cambridge (2020)",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The brain constantly turns large flows of sensory information into selective
representations of the environment. It, therefore, needs to learn to process
those sensory inputs that are most relevant for behaviour. It is not well
understood how learning changes neural circuits in visual and decision-making
brain areas to adjust and improve its visually guided decision-making. To
address this question, head-fixed mice were trained to move through virtual
reality environments and learn visual discrimination while neural activity was
recorded with two-photon calcium imaging. Previously, descriptive models of
neuronal activity were fitted to the data, which was used to compare the
activity of excitatory and different inhibitory cell types. However, the
previous models did not take the internal representations and learning dynamics
into account. Here, I present a framework to infer a model of internal
representations that are used to generate the behaviour during the task. We
model the learning process from untrained mice to trained mice within the
normative framework of the ideal Bayesian observer and provide a Markov model
for generating the movement and licking. The framework provides a space of
models where a range of hypotheses about the internal representations could be
compared for a given data set.
