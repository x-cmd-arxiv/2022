statistics and theoretical machine learning. However, random matrix theory is
largely focused on the proportional asymptotics in which the number of columns
grows proportionally to the number of rows of the data matrix. This is not
always the most natural setting in statistics where columns correspond to
covariates and rows to samples. With the objective to move beyond the
proportional asymptotics, we revisit ridge regression ($\ell_2$-penalized least
squares) on i.i.d. data $(x_i, y_i)$, $i\le n$, where $x_i$ is a feature vector
and $y_i = \beta^\top x_i +\epsilon_i \in\mathbb{R}$ is a response. We allow
the feature vector to be high-dimensional, or even infinite-dimensional, in
which case it belongs to a separable Hilbert space, and assume either $z_i :=
\Sigma^{-1/2}x_i$ to have i.i.d. entries, or to satisfy a certain convex
concentration property. Within this setting, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
that approximate the bias and variance of ridge regression in terms of the bias
and variance of an `equivalent' sequence model (a regression model with
diagonal design matrix). The approximation is up to multiplicative factors
bounded by $(1\pm \Delta)$ for some explicitly small $\Delta$. Previously, such
an approximation result was known only in the proportional regime and only up
to additive errors: in particular, it did not allow to characterize the
behavior of the excess risk when this converges to $0$. Our general theory
recovers earlier results in the proportional regime (with better error rates).
As a new application, we obtain a completely explicit and sharp
characterization of ridge regression for Hilbert covariates with regularly
varying spectrum. Finally, we analyze the overparametrized near-interpolation
setting and obtain sharp `benign overfitting' guarantees.

been restricted to the subset of programs that have a continuous dependence on

distribution parameters, such as flipping a coin with probability $p$ of being
heads, pose a challenge to these systems because the connection between the
result (heads vs tails) and the parameters ($p$) is fundamentally discrete. In
this paper we develop a new reparameterization-based methodology that allows
for generating programs whose expectation is the derivative of the expectation
of the original program. We showcase how this method gives an unbiased and

generation. However, artifacts often inevitably appear in the generated
results, leading to downgraded user experience and reduced performance in
downstream tasks. This work aims to develop a plugin post-processing module for
diverse generative models, which can faithfully restore images from diverse
generative artifacts. This is challenging because: (1) Unlike traditional
degradation patterns, generative artifacts are non-linear and the
transformation function is highly complex. (2) There are no readily available
artifact-image pairs. (3) Different from model-specific anti-artifact methods,
a model-agnostic framework views the generator as a black-box machine and has
no access to the architecture details. In this work, we first design a group of
mechanisms to simulate generative artifacts of popular generators (i.e., GANs,
autoregressive models, and diffusion models), given real images. Second, we
implement the model-agnostic anti-artifact framework as an image-to-image
diffusion model, due to its advantage in generation quality and capacity.
Finally, we design a conditioning scheme for the diffusion model to enable both
blind and non-blind image restoration. A guidance parameter is also introduced
to allow for a trade-off between restoration accuracy and image quality.
Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms previous
approaches on the proposed datasets and real-world artifact images.

many perceptual tasks, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples that are
generated by adding slight but maliciously crafted perturbations to benign
images. Adversarial detection is an important technique for identifying
adversarial examples before they are entered into target DNNs. Previous studies
to detect adversarial examples either targeted specific attacks or required
expensive computation. How design a lightweight unsupervised detector is still
a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an AutoEncoder-based
Adversarial Examples (AEAE) detector, that can guard DNN models by detecting
adversarial examples with low computation in an unsupervised manner. The AEAE
includes only a shallow autoencoder but plays two roles. First, a well-trained
autoencoder has learned the manifold of benign examples. This autoencoder can
produce a large reconstruction error for adversarial images with large
perturbations, so we can detect significantly perturbed adversarial examples
based on the reconstruction error. Second, the autoencoder can filter out the
small noise and change the DNN's prediction on adversarial examples with small
perturbations. It helps to detect slightly perturbed adversarial examples based
on the prediction distance. To cover these two cases, we utilize the
reconstruction error and prediction distance from benign images to construct a
two-tuple feature set and train an adversarial detector using the isolation
forest algorithm. We show empirically that the AEAE is unsupervised and
inexpensive against the most state-of-the-art attacks. Through the detection in
these two cases, there is nowhere to hide adversarial examples.

emotion, we termed it an emotional event. Microstate segmentation is performed
for all emotional events to calculate the set of microstates (MS). Followed by
a comparison of calculated statistical parameters and transition probabilities

group invariance properties of the linear model to ensure that our procedure

This is commonly achieved by employing slowly tunable narrowband lasers as
interrogation sources, hence limiting the acquisition speed. We propose instead
to use a broadband source and a fast tunable acousto-optic filter to adjust the
interrogation wavelength at each pixel within a few microseconds. We

logical zonotopes. A logical zonotope is constructed by XOR-ing a binary vector
with a combination of binary vectors called generators. A logical zonotope can
efficiently represent up to 2^n binary vectors using only n generators. Instead
of the explicit enumeration of the zonotopes' members, logical operations over
sets of binary vectors are applied directly to a zonotopes' generators. Thus,
logical zonotopes can be used to greatly reduce the computational complexity of
a variety of operations over sets of binary vectors, including logical
operations (e.g. XOR, NAND, AND, OR) and semi-tensor products. Additionally, we
show that, similar to the role classical zonotopes play for formally verifying
dynamical systems defined over real vector spaces, logical zonotopes can be
used to efficiently analyze the forward reachability of dynamical systems
defined over binary vector spaces (e.g. logical circuits or Boolean networks).
To showcase the utility of logical zonotopes, we illustrate three use cases:
(1) discovering the key of a linear-feedback shift register with a linear time
complexity, (2) verifying the safety of a logical vehicle intersection crossing
protocol, and (3) performing reachability analysis for a high-dimensional
Boolean function.

of scientific progress of the field. Beyond designing DRL methods for general
intelligence, designing task-specific methods is becoming increasingly
prominent for real-world applications. In these settings, the standard
evaluation practice involves using a few instances of Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) to represent the task. However, many tasks induce a large family of MDPs
owing to variations in the underlying environment, particularly in real-world
contexts. For example, in traffic signal control, variations may stem from
intersection geometries and traffic flow levels. The select MDP instances may
thus inadvertently cause overfitting, lacking the statistical power to draw
conclusions about the method's true performance across the family. In this
article, we augment DRL evaluations to consider parameterized families of MDPs.
We show that in comparison to evaluating DRL methods on select MDP instances,
evaluating the MDP family often yields a substantially different relative
ranking of methods, casting doubt on what methods should be considered
state-of-the-art. We validate this phenomenon in standard control benchmarks
and the real-world application of traffic signal control. At the same time, we
show that accurately evaluating on an MDP family is nontrivial. Overall, this
work identifies new challenges for empirical rigor in reinforcement learning,
especially as the outcomes of DRL trickle into downstream decision-making.

proton spin as well as QCD factorization. However, very limited experimental
constraints on the gluon TMD exist currently. As the heavy quark production in
lepton-nucleon DIS gets a dominant contribution from the photon-gluon-fusion
process, heavy quark production makes an attractive tool to probe gluon
distributions in nucleons. In this paper we present a study of heavy flavor
hadron pair reconstruction at a future EIC detector with MAPS based inner
tracking and vertexing subsystems to constrain gluon TMD. We utilize the
excellent track pointing resolution provided by the detector to exclusively
reconstruct heavy flavor hadron pairs via their hadronic decay channels and
also to develop a heavy flavor hadron tagging algorithm. Statistical
uncertainty projections on azimuthal asymmetries corresponding to gluon TMD at
the EIC is evaluated. The heavy flavor tagging is found to substantially
enhance the purity of heavy flavor hadron pair selection, and the statistical
precision of the measurement compared to that from exclusive reconstruction.
The correlation between the azimuthal angle of the transverse momentum of the
gluon initiating the process and that of the corresponding heavy flavor hadron
pair was also studied and found to be well correlated. This study opens up
heavy flavor hadron pair measurements as an attractive channel to access gluon

hardware noise. A systematic way to remove such bias is probabilistic error
cancellation (PEC). PEC requires a full characterization of the noise and
introduces a sampling overhead that increases exponentially with circuit depth,
prohibiting high-depth circuits at realistic noise levels. Probabilistic error

The Campaign Manager (CM) is a new observing mode that has been developed for
Skynet. Available to all Skynet observers, the CM semi-autonomously and
indefinitely scales and schedules exposures on the observer's behalf while
allowing for modification to scaling parameters in real time. The CM is useful

  Planar","ICALP 2023",,,,"math.CO cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Twin-width is a structural width parameter introduced by Bonnet, Kim,
Thomass\'e and Watrigant [FOCS 2020]. Very briefly, its essence is a gradual
reduction (a contraction sequence) of the given graph down to a single vertex
while maintaining limited difference of neighbourhoods of the vertices, and it
can be seen as widely generalizing several other traditional structural
parameters. Having such a sequence at hand allows us to solve many otherwise
hard problems efficiently. Graph classes of bounded twin-width, in which
appropriate contraction sequences are efficiently constructible, are thus of
interest in combinatorics and in computer science. However, we currently do not
know in general how to obtain a witnessing contraction sequence of low width
efficiently, and published upper bounds on the twin-width in non-trivial cases
are often ""astronomically large"".
  We focus on planar graphs, which are known to have bounded twin-width
(already since the introduction of twin-width), but the first explicit
""non-astronomical"" upper bounds on the twin-width of planar graphs appeared
just a year ago; namely the bound of at most 183 by Jacob and Pilipczuk [arXiv,
January 2022], and 583 by Bonnet, Kwon and Wood [arXiv, February 2022].
Subsequent arXiv manuscripts in 2022 improved the bound down to 37 (Bekos et
al.), 11 and 9 (both by Hlin\v{e}n\'y). We further elaborate on the approach
used in the latter manuscripts, proving that the twin-width of every planar
graph is at most 8, and construct a witnessing contraction sequence in linear
time. Note that the currently best lower-bound planar example is of twin-width
7, by Kr\'al' and Lamaison [arXiv, September 2022]. We also prove that the
twin-width of every bipartite planar graph is at most 6, and again construct a
witnessing contraction sequence in linear time.

robots can expand their reachable workspace that, otherwise, would be

simulation that assumes an AGN heating temperature of $10^{8.5}$K but are
incompatible with the model that assumes an AGN heating temperature of

semantic variation is not well understood and under-explored in the natural

variation is driven by culture-dependent communicative needs. An alternative
view focuses on slang's social functions suggesting that the desire to foster
semantic distinction may have led to the historical emergence of
community-specific slang senses. We explore these theories using computational
models and test them against historical slang dictionary entries, with a focus
on characterizing regularity in the geographical variation of slang usages
attested in the US and the UK over the past two centuries. We show that our

evaluate the performance of new products or services. In addition to augmenting
managers' decision-making, experimentation mitigates risk by limiting the
proportion of customers exposed to innovation. Since many experiments are on
customers arriving sequentially, a potential solution is to allow managers to
""peek"" at the results when new data becomes available and stop the test if the
results are statistically significant. Unfortunately, peeking invalidates the
statistical guarantees for standard statistical analysis and leads to
uncontrolled type-1 error. Our paper provides valid design-based confidence
sequences, sequences of confidence intervals with uniform type-1 error
guarantees over time for various sequential experiments in an assumption-light
manner. In particular, we focus on finite-sample estimands defined on the study
participants as a direct measure of the incurred risks by companies. Our
proposed confidence sequences are valid for a large class of experiments,
including multi-arm bandits, time series, and panel experiments. We further
provide a variance reduction technique incorporating modeling assumptions and
covariates. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach
through a simulation study and three real-world applications from Netflix. Our
results show that by using our confidence sequence, harmful experiments could
be stopped after only observing a handful of units; for instance, an experiment
that Netflix ran on its sign-up page on 30,000 potential customers would have
been stopped by our method on the first day before 100 observations.

scalar fields. Two desirable properties for these distances to exhibit are 1)
the ability to discern between scalar fields which other, less complex
topological summaries cannot and 2) to still be robust to perturbations in the
dataset. The combination of these two properties, known respectively as
stability and discriminativity, has led to theoretical distances which are
either thought to be or shown to be computationally complex and thus their
implementations have been scarce. In order to design similarity measures on
merge trees which are computationally feasible for more complex merge trees,
many researchers have elected to loosen the restrictions on at least one of
these two properties. The question still remains, however, if there are
practical situations where trading these desirable properties is necessary.
Here we construct a distance between merge trees which is designed to retain
both discriminativity and stability. While our approach can be expensive for
large merge trees, we illustrate its use in a setting where the number of nodes
is small. This setting can be made more practical since we also provide a proof
that persistence simplification increases the outputted distance by at most
half of the simplified value. We demonstrate our distance measure on
applications in shape comparison and on detection of periodicity in the von

neural networks resort to downsampling them or projecting them to 2D. We
propose an effective alternative, a neural network that enables efficient
classification of full-resolution 3D medical images. Compared to off-the-shelf
convolutional neural networks, our network, 3D Globally-Aware Multiple Instance
Classifier (3D-GMIC), uses 77.98%-90.05% less GPU memory and 91.23%-96.02% less
computation. While it is trained only with image-level labels, without
segmentation labels, it explains its predictions by providing pixel-level
saliency maps. On a dataset collected at NYU Langone Health, including 85,526
patients with full-field 2D mammography (FFDM), synthetic 2D mammography, and
3D mammography, 3D-GMIC achieves an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.769-0.887) in

synthetic 2D (0.826, 95% CI: 0.754-0.884), which demonstrates that 3D-GMIC
successfully classified large 3D images despite focusing computation on a
smaller percentage of its input compared to GMIC. Therefore, 3D-GMIC identifies
and utilizes extremely small regions of interest from 3D images consisting of
hundreds of millions of pixels, dramatically reducing associated computational
challenges. 3D-GMIC generalizes well to BCS-DBT, an external dataset from Duke

Omniprediction through the lens of Outcome Indistingusihability. For a
collection of losses and hypothesis class, omniprediction requires that a
predictor provide a loss-minimization guarantee simultaneously for every loss
in the collection compared to the best (loss-specific) hypothesis in the class.
We present a generic template to learn predictors satisfying a guarantee we
call Loss Outcome Indistinguishability. For a set of statistical tests--based
on a collection of losses and hypothesis class--a predictor is Loss OI if it is
indistinguishable (according to the tests) from Nature's true probabilities
over outcomes. By design, Loss OI implies omniprediction in a direct and
intuitive manner. We simplify Loss OI further, decomposing it into a
calibration condition plus multiaccuracy for a class of functions derived from
the loss and hypothesis classes. By careful analysis of this class, we give
efficient constructions of omnipredictors for interesting classes of loss
functions, including non-convex losses.
  This decomposition highlights the utility of a new multi-group fairness
notion that we call calibrated multiaccuracy, which lies in between
multiaccuracy and multicalibration. We show that calibrated multiaccuracy
implies Loss OI for the important set of convex losses arising from Generalized
Linear Models, without requiring full multicalibration. For such losses, we
show an equivalence between our computational notion of Loss OI and a geometric
notion of indistinguishability, formulated as Pythagorean theorems in the
associated Bregman divergence. We give an efficient algorithm for calibrated
multiaccuracy with computational complexity comparable to that of
multiaccuracy. In all, calibrated multiaccuracy offers an interesting tradeoff
point between efficiency and generality in the omniprediction landscape.

computation techniques to transfer learning (TL), a widely popular ML
technique, in the context of disaggregated cloud object stores. Our techniques
benefit both cloud providers and users. They improve our operational efficiency
while providing users the performance improvements they demand from us. The
main practical challenge to consider is that the storage-side computational
resources are limited. Our approach is to split the TL deep neural network
(DNN) during the feature extraction phase, before the training phase. This
reduces the network transfers to the compute tier and further decouples the
batch size of feature extraction from the training batch size. This facilitates
our second technique, storage-side batch adaptation, which enables increased
concurrency in the storage tier while avoiding out-of-memory errors. Guided by
these insights, we present HAPI, our processing system for TL that spans the
compute and storage tiers while remaining transparent to the user. Our
evaluation with several state-of-the-art DNNs, such as ResNet, VGG, and
Transformer, shows up to 11x improvement in application runtime and up to 8.3x
reduction in the data transferred from the storage to the compute tier compared

fine-grained ``organ-wise"" contrast variations across all organs; (2) the label
(i.e., contrast phase) is typically manually provided, which is error-prone and
may introduce manual biases of defining phases. In this paper, we propose a
novel data-driven contrastive loss function that adapts the similar/dissimilar
contrast relationship between samples in each minibatch at organ-level.
Specifically, as variable levels of contrast exist between organs, we
hypothesis that the contrast differences in the organ-level can bring
additional context for defining representations in the latent space. An
organ-wise contrast correlation matrix is computed with mean organ intensities
under one-hot attention maps. The goal of adapting the organ-driven correlation
matrix is to model variable levels of feature separability at different phases.
We evaluate our proposed approach on multi-organ segmentation with both
non-contrast CT (NCCT) datasets and the MICCAI 2015 BTCV Challenge
contrast-enhance CT (CECT) datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, our proposed contrastive loss yields a substantial and significant
improvement of 1.41% (from 0.923 to 0.936, p-value$<$0.01) and 2.02% (from
0.891 to 0.910, p-value$<$0.01) on mean Dice scores across all organs with
respect to NCCT and CECT cohorts. We further assess the trained model
performance with the MICCAI 2021 FLARE Challenge CECT datasets and achieve a

few-shot temporal knowledge graph reasoning, that aims to predict future facts
for newly emerging entities based on extremely limited observations in evolving
graphs. It offers practical value in applications that need to derive instant
new knowledge about new entities in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) with
minimal supervision. The challenges mainly come from the few-shot and time
shift properties of new entities. First, the limited observations associated
with them are insufficient for training a model from scratch. Second, the
potentially dynamic distributions from the initially observable facts to the
future facts ask for explicitly modeling the evolving characteristics of new
entities. We correspondingly propose a novel Meta Temporal Knowledge Graph
Reasoning (MetaTKGR) framework. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid
neighborhood aggregation schemes to enhance low-data entity representation,
MetaTKGR dynamically adjusts the strategies of sampling and aggregating
neighbors from recent facts for new entities, through temporally supervised
signals on future facts as instant feedback. Besides, such a meta temporal
reasoning procedure goes beyond existing meta-learning paradigms on static
knowledge graphs that fail to handle temporal adaptation with large entity
variance. We further provide a theoretical analysis and propose a temporal
adaptation regularizer to stabilize the meta temporal reasoning over time.
Empirically, extensive experiments on three real-world TKGs demonstrate the
superiority of MetaTKGR over state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.

sources, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) creates significant opportunities for
shared-use AV mobility services (SAMSs) to provide accessible and
demand-responsive personal mobility. SAMS fleet operation involves multiple
interrelated decisions, with a primary focus on efficiently fulfilling
passenger ride requests with a high level of service quality. This paper
focuses on improving the efficiency and service quality of a SAMS vehicle fleet
via anticipatory repositioning of idle vehicles. The rebalancing problem is
formulated as a Markov Decision Process, which we propose solving using an
advantage actor critic (A2C) reinforcement learning-based method. The proposed
approach learns a rebalancing policy that anticipates future demand and
cooperates with an optimization-based assignment strategy. The approach allows
for centralized repositioning decisions and can handle large vehicle fleets
since the problem size does not change with the fleet size. Using New York City
taxi data and an agent-based simulation tool, two versions of the A2C AV
repositioning approach are tested. The first version, A2C-AVR(A), learns to
anticipate future demand based on past observations, while the second,
A2C-AVR(B), uses demand forecasts. The models are compared to an
optimization-based rebalancing approach and show significant reduction in mean
passenger waiting times, with a slightly increased percentage of empty fleet
miles travelled. The experiments demonstrate the model's ability to anticipate
future demand and its transferability to cases unseen at the training stage.

is unclear. One promising solution is the collapse of a primordial supermassive
star. Observational confirmation of this scenario may be challenging, but a
general relativistic instability supernova provides one avenue for such.
Previous studies have found that a general relativistic instability supernova
has a potentially decades-long plateau phase visible to JWST at high redshift.
In this work, we examine stars with mass just below the general relativistic
instability supernova mass range. These stars pulsate, ejecting a portion of
their envelopes. They then contract quasi-statically back to an equilibrium
temperature, at which point they again become unstable and pulsate once more.
Because each pulse consumes a small amount of the available nuclear fuel, there
exists the possibility of multiple pulsations. We present simulations of the
contracting phase, the pulsation, and the light-curve phase. We find that the
lower mass pulsating models are even brighter than the higher mass supernovae
because the pulsations occur in the late helium burning phase when the stars
have extremely large radii. The fact that the pulsations are more luminous and
occur in a wider mass range than the supernovae bodes well for observation.

for addressing important safety concerns at the hardware level by separating
the high-impedance actuator from the end effector by providing the power
transfer from electromagnetic source to the human. However, the existing
clutches suffer from high power consumption and large-weight, which make them
undesirable from the design point of view. In this paper, for the first time,
the design and development of a novel, lightweight, and low-power
torque-adjustable rotary clutch using electroadhesive materials is presented.
The performance of three different pairs of clutch plates is investigated in
the context of the smoothness and quality of output torque. The performance
degradation issue due to the polarization of the insulator is addressed through
the utilization of an alternating current waveform activation signal. Moreover,
the effect of the activation frequency on the output torque and power
consumption of the clutch is investigated. Finally, a time-dependent model for
the output torque of the clutch is presented, and the performance of the clutch
was evaluated through experiments, including physical human-robot interaction.
The proposed clutch offers a torque to power consumption ratio that is six
times better than commercial magnetic particle clutches. The proposed clutch
presents great potential for developing safe, lightweight, and low-power
physical human-robot interaction systems, such as exoskeletons and robotic
walkers.

observation, we remove the assumption of perfectly rational agents and propose
incorporating the concept of bounded rationality from an information-theoretic
view into the game-theoretic framework. This allows the robots to reason other
agents' sub-optimal behaviors and act accordingly under their computational
constraints. Specifically, bounded rationality directly models the agent's
information processing ability, which is represented as the KL-divergence
between nominal and optimized stochastic policies, and the solution to the
bounded-optimal policy can be obtained by an efficient importance sampling
approach. Using both simulated and real-world experiments in multi-robot
navigation tasks, we demonstrate that the resulting framework allows the robots
to reason about different levels of rational behaviors of other agents and
compute a reasonable strategy under its computational constraint.

prepared by wet etching with four different solutions were studied in terms of
the surface morphology, defect density and achievable thickness. Both
nanostrip-based solution (1:1:10) and HCl-based solution (1:1:5) were able to
wet-etch 535 micron thick bulk-Ge substrates to Ge films thinner than 10 micron
within 53 hours. The corresponding RMS surface roughness was 32 nm for the
nanostrip-based solution and 10 nm for the HCl-based solution. The good quality
of bulk-Ge was preserved before and after the etching process according to the
HRXRD results. The low threading dislocation density of 6000-7000 cm-2 was
maintained in the process of wet etching without introducing extra defects.
This approach provides an inexpensive and convenient way to prepare

  In this work, we present the first practical ImageNet-scale method to verify

To do so, we leverage recent developments in ZK-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct
non-interactive argument of knowledge), a form of zero-knowledge proofs.
ZK-SNARKs allows us to verify ML model execution non-interactively and with
only standard cryptographic hardness assumptions. In particular, we provide the
first ZK-SNARK proof of valid inference for a full resolution ImageNet model,
achieving 79\% top-5 accuracy. We further use these ZK-SNARKs to design
protocols to verify ML model execution in a variety of scenarios, including for
verifying MLaaS predictions, verifying MLaaS model accuracy, and using ML
models for trustless retrieval. Together, our results show that ZK-SNARKs have

form of graph from images and texts. Image-based scene graph generation
research has been actively conducted until recently, whereas text-based scene
graph generation research has not. In this paper, we focus on the problem of
scene graph parsing from textual description of a visual scene. The core idea
is to use abstract meaning representation (AMR) instead of the dependency
parsing mainly used in previous studies. AMR is a graph-based semantic
formalism of natural language which abstracts concepts of words in a sentence
contrary to the dependency parsing which considers dependency relationships on
all words in a sentence. To this end, we design a simple yet effective
two-stage scene graph parsing framework utilizing abstract meaning
representation, SGRAM (Scene GRaph parsing via Abstract Meaning
representation): 1) transforming a textual description of an image into an AMR
graph (Text-to-AMR) and 2) encoding the AMR graph into a Transformer-based
language model to generate a scene graph (AMR-to-SG). Experimental results show
the scene graphs generated by our framework outperforms the dependency
parsing-based model by 11.61\% and the previous state-of-the-art model using a
pre-trained Transformer language model by 3.78\%. Furthermore, we apply SGRAM
to image retrieval task which is one of downstream tasks for scene graph, and
confirm the effectiveness of scene graphs generated by our framework.

better parameter estimation of the robot's stochastic motion model. The IPW is
a re-weighting approach to ensure unbiased estimation, and the DR approach
further combines any two estimators to strengthen the unbiased result even if
one of these estimators is biased. We then develop an approximate policy

challenging mixed-size placement for FPGA designs which cannot be addressed by
previous analytical placers. Moreover, general timing-driven placement
algorithms are facing challenges when handling real-world application design

open-source comprehensive timing-driven analytical mixed-size FPGA placer. It
supports mixed-size placement of heterogeneous resources (e.g.,
LUT/FF/LUTRAM/MUX/CARRY/DSP/BRAM) on FPGA, with an interface to Xilinx Vivado.
Standing upon the shoulders of AMF-Placer 1.0, AMFPlacer 2.0 is equipped with a
series of new techniques for timing optimization, including a simple but
effective timing model, placement-blockage-aware anchor insertion, WNS-aware
timing-driven quadratic placement, and sector-guided detailed placement. Based
on a set of the latest large open-source benchmarks from various domains for
Xilinx Ultrascale FPGAs, experimental results indicate that critical path
delays realized by AMF-Placer 2.0 are averagely 2.2% and 0.59% higher than

limited by the absence of the exact timing model of the device, the information
of design hierarchy and accurate routing feedback, AMF-Placer 2.0 is the first
open-source FPGA placer which can handle the timingdriven mixed-size placement
of practical complex designs with various FPGA resources and achieves the

interlayer adhesion and suffering from environmental disturbances significantly
limit their endurance and efficiency. Herein via conducting first-principles
calculations, we explore surface passivation and exfoliation of MXene via
polymers which have been experimentally proven to promote the performance. Nine
kinds of monomers together with the typical MXene Ti3C2T2 (T= None, O, F, OH,
F0.5O0.5) as prototype composites are explored with respect to the adsorption
and charge transfer associated with energetics and chemical redox,
respectively. Our work shows that naked Ti3C2 MXene has a strong ability to
cleave and decompose the monomers. Surface functionalized Ti3C2F2, Ti3C2FO, and
Ti3C2O2 have a weak binding with monomers through only van der Waals force,
whereas Ti3C2(OH)2 also exhibits strengthened binding for some monomers.
Specific functional groups in the monomer, such as the halogen, sulfur, and
hydroxyl groups or a relatively planar aromatic structure, largely contribute
to the adsorption. We reveal that the functionalization through polymer would
alter the carriers' density via interfacial charge transfer in MXenes. While
the naked Ti3C2 and Ti3C2(OH)2 donate electrons to the polymers, the Ti3C2F2,
Ti3C2FO, and Ti3C2O2 receive small amounts of electrons transferred from the
polymer, highly depending on the types of the monomers. The varying ability of
charge transfer and exfoliation energy of different monomers implies great
flexibility for designing polymers to exfoliate the MXene and modulate the
carrier densities which is highly desired for altering conductivity, dielectric

reproduced when the DM mass is larger than the half of the Higgs mass, where
the lower limit generally comes from the constraint of DM invisible decay and

atomic-gas) properties of 38 subsamples with $M_{\rm star}>10^9$~M$_\odot$

activity in the Fornax galaxies is caused by the decrease in the cold-gas mass
fraction with respect to stellar mass (hereafter, gas fraction) rather than the
decrease of the SF efficiency from the cold gas; (2) the atomic-gas fraction is
more heavily reduced than the molecular-gas fraction of such galaxies with low
SF activity. A comparison between the cold-gas properties of the Fornax
galaxies and their environmental properties suggests that the atomic gas is
stripped tidally and by the ram pressure, which leads to the molecular gas
depletion with an aid of the strangulation and consequently SF quenching.

reason for this small contribution is due to the small effective masses in
perovskites, resulting in a natural length scale of around 20nm for the
""effective confining potential"" for electrons and holes, with short range
potential fluctuations smoothed out. The increase in Urbach energy across the
compositional range agrees well with our optical absorption measurements. We
model systems of sizes up to 80 nm in three dimensions, allowing us to explore

DBM result for the perturbation amplitude evolution is in good agreement with
that of experiment. Greatly different from the case of normal shocking on
unperturbed plane interface between two uniform media, in the RMI case, the
Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium (TNE) quantities show complex but inspiring
kinetic effects in the shocking process and behind the shock front. The kinetic
effects are detected by two sets of TNE quantities. The first set are $\left

$\left | \Delta _{3}^{ {\rm{*}}}\right |$, and $\left |\Delta _{4,2}^{

process. $\left |\Delta _{3,1}^{ {\rm{*}}}\right |$ and $\left |\Delta _{3}^{

lower rate behind the shock front. $\left |\Delta _{2}^{ {\rm{*}}}\right |$ and

similar behaviors. They quickly decrease to be very small behind the shock
front. The second set of TNE quantities are ${\dot{S} _{NOMF}}$, ${\dot{S}

the automatic speech recognition (ASR) community recently because of its
success in harnessing unlabeled data. Unlike prior semi-supervised learning
approaches that relied on iteratively regenerating pseudo-labels (PLs) from a
trained model and using them to train a new model, recent state-of-the-art
methods perform `continuous training' where PLs are generated using a very
recent version of the model being trained. Nevertheless, these approaches still
rely on bootstrapping the ST using an initial supervised learning phase where
the model is trained on labeled data alone. We believe this has the potential
for over-fitting to the labeled dataset in low resource settings and that ST
from the start of training should reduce over-fitting. In this paper we show
how we can do this by dynamically controlling the evolution of PLs during the
training process in ASR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that shows the feasibility of generating PLs from the very start of the
training. We are able to achieve this using two techniques that avoid
instabilities which lead to degenerate models that do not generalize. Firstly,
we control the evolution of PLs through a curriculum that uses the online
changes in PLs to control the membership of the cache of PLs and improve
generalization. Secondly, we find that by sampling transcriptions from the
predictive distribution, rather than only using the best transcription, we can
stabilize training further. With these techniques, our ST models match prior
works without an external language model.

videos pertinent to a given textual query. Existing retrieval systems tend to
rely on retrieval bias as a shortcut and thus, fail to sufficiently learn
multi-modal interactions between query and video. This retrieval bias stems
from learning frequent co-occurrence patterns between query and moments, which
spuriously correlate objects (e.g., a pencil) referred in the query with
moments (e.g., scene of writing with a pencil) where the objects frequently
appear in the video, such that they converge into biased moment predictions.
Although recent debiasing methods have focused on removing this retrieval bias,
we argue that these biased predictions sometimes should be preserved because
there are many queries where biased predictions are rather helpful. To
conjugate this retrieval bias, we propose a Selective Query-guided Debiasing
network (SQuiDNet), which incorporates the following two main properties: (1)
Biased Moment Retrieval that intentionally uncovers the biased moments inherent
in objects of the query and (2) Selective Query-guided Debiasing that performs
selective debiasing guided by the meaning of the query. Our experimental
results on three moment retrieval benchmarks (i.e., TVR, ActivityNet, DiDeMo)
show the effectiveness of SQuiDNet and qualitative analysis shows improved
interpretability.

compensating data owners for their contribution. There is increasing
recognition in the machine learning community that the Shapley value -- a
foundational profit-sharing scheme in cooperative game theory -- has major
potential to value data, because it uniquely satisfies basic properties for
fair credit allocation and has been shown to be able to identify data sources
that are useful or harmful to model performance. However, calculating the
Shapley value requires accessing original data sources. It still remains an
open question how to design a real-world data marketplace that takes advantage
of the Shapley value-based data pricing while protecting privacy and allowing
fair payments. In this paper, we propose the {\em first} prototype of a data
marketplace that values data sources based on the Shapley value in a
privacy-preserving manner and at the same time ensures fair payments. Our
approach is enabled by a suite of innovations on both algorithm and system
design. We firstly propose a Shapley value calculation algorithm that can be
efficiently implemented via multiparty computation (MPC) circuits. The key idea
is to learn a performance predictor that can directly predict model performance
corresponding to an input dataset without performing actual training. We
further optimize the MPC circuit design based on the structure of the
performance predictor. We further incorporate fair payment into the MPC circuit
to guarantee that the data that the buyer pays for is exactly the same as the
one that has been valuated. Our experimental results show that the proposed new
data valuation algorithm is as effective as the original expensive one.
Furthermore, the customized MPC protocol is efficient and scalable.

first undergoes a passive $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition, with the
shifted eigenvalues changing from real to complex, and then a $K$-symmetry
restoring transition, characterized by the emergence of pure imaginary spectrum
with equal spacing. Accordingly, the eigenstates change from
$\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken extended states to the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken states,
and finally to stark localized states. In the framework of the quantum open
system governed by Lindblad equation with linearly increasing site-dependent

under various initial states, we demonstrate that the damping dynamics displays
distinct behaviors in different regions. A localized damping is observed in the

today including robotics, AR/VR, and 3D visualization. 3D mapping involves
continuously fusing depth maps obtained from depth sensors in phones, robots,

Many important applications, e.g., global path planning and trajectory
generation in micro aerial vehicles, require the construction of large maps at
high resolutions. In this work, we identify mapping, i.e., construction and
updates of 3D maps to be a critical bottleneck in these applications. The
memory required and access times of these maps limit the size of the

VoxelCache: a hardware-software technique to accelerate map data access times

access voxels in the map that are spatially co-located to each other. We
leverage this temporal locality in voxel accesses to cache indices to blocks of
voxels to enable quick lookup and avoid expensive access times. We evaluate
VoxelCache on popularly used mapping and reconstruction applications on both

time-varying and time-invariant parameters. It has been shown that the
robustness of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating
time-invariant parameters alongside nonlinear filters for state estimation
provided more reliable estimates than the estimates obtained solely using
nonlinear filters for combined state and parameter estimation. In a similar
fashion, we adopt the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation and the
estimation of the time-varying system parameters, but reserve the task of
estimating time-invariant parameters to the MCMC algorithm. In a standard
method, we augment the state vector to include the original states of the
system and the subset of the parameters that are time-varying. Each
time-varying parameter is perturbed by a white noise process, and we treat the
strength of this artificial noise as an additional time-invariant parameter to
be estimated by MCMC, circumventing the need for manual tuning. Conventionally,
both time-varying and time-invariant parameters are appended in the state
vector, and thus for the purpose of estimation, both are free to vary in time.
However, allowing time-invariant system parameters to vary in time introduces
artificial dynamics into the system, which we avoid by treating these
time-invariant parameters as static and estimating them using MCMC.
Furthermore, by estimating the time-invariant parameters by MCMC, the augmented
state is smaller and the nonlinearity in the ensuing state space model will
tend to be weaker than in the conventional approach. We illustrate the
above-described approach for a simple dynamical system in which some model
parameters are time-varying, while the remaining parameters are time-invariant.

due to randomness and subjectivity of human movement. However, the moving
patterns of human in a constrained scenario typically conform to a limited
number of regularities to a certain extent, because of the scenario
restrictions and person-person or person-object interactivity. Thus, an
individual person in this scenario should follow one of the regularities as
well. In other words, a person's subsequent trajectory has likely been traveled
by others. Based on this hypothesis, we propose to forecast a person's future
trajectory by learning from the implicit scene regularities. We call the
regularities, inherently derived from the past dynamics of the people and the
environment in the scene, scene history. We categorize scene history
information into two types: historical group trajectory and
individual-surroundings interaction. To exploit these two types of information
for trajectory prediction, we propose a novel framework Scene History
Excavating Network (SHENet), where the scene history is leveraged in a simple
yet effective approach. In particular, we design two components: the group
trajectory bank module to extract representative group trajectories as the
candidate for future path, and the cross-modal interaction module to model the
interaction between individual past trajectory and its surroundings for
trajectory refinement. In addition, to mitigate the uncertainty in ground-truth
trajectory, caused by the aforementioned randomness and subjectivity of human

benefited from progress in deep convolutional neural networks and can, for

radiographs? And how many radiographs do we need use when re-training a deep
learning model?
  Methods: We annotated 396 radiographs of left and right carpi dorsal 75
medial to palmarolateral oblique (DMPLO) projection with the location of
radius, proximal row of carpal bones, distal row of carpal bones, accessory
carpal bone, first carpal bone (if present), and metacarpus (metacarpal II,
III, and IV). The radiographs and respective annotations were splited into sets
that were used to leave-one-out cross-validation of models created using
transfer learn from YOLOv5s.
  Results: Models trained using 96 radiographs or more achieved precision,
recall and mAP above 0.95, including for the first carpal bone, when trained

the first carpal bone compared with the other bones.
  Conclusions: Free and open source state of the art object detection models

reciprocal space based on Berry curvature and related quantities, and in real
space in terms of the spatial average of a quantum mechanical local marker.
Here we consider a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic material having a
vanishing bulk but a nonzero surface orbital magnetization. We ask whether the
surface-normal component of the surface magnetization is well defined, and if
so, how to compute it. As the physical observable corresponding to this
quantity, we identify the macroscopic current running along a hinge shared by
two facets. However, the hinge current only constrains the difference of the
surface magnetizations on the adjoined facets, leaving a potential ambiguity.
By performing a symmetry analysis, we find that only crystals exhibiting a
pseudoscalar symmetry admit well-defined magnetizations at their surfaces at
the classical level. We then explore the possibility of computing surface
magnetization via a coarse-graining procedure applied to a quantum local
marker. We show that multiple expressions for the local marker exist, and apply
constraints to filter out potentially meaningful candidates. Using several
tight-binding models as our theoretical test bed and several potential markers,
we compute surface magnetizations for slab geometries and compare their
predictions with explicit calculations of the macroscopic hinge currents of rod
geometries. We find that only a particular form of the marker consistently
predicts the correct hinge currents.

Unfortunately, real-world data collection and annotation is extremely costly &

the real-world, two shortcomings need to be addressed. First, existing methods
usually generate data which are more noisy and complete than the real point
clouds, due to 3D reconstruction error and pure geometry-based raycasting
method. Second, prior works on simulation for object detection focus solely on
rigid objects, like cars, but VRUs, like pedestrians, are important road
participants. To tackle the first challenge, we propose FPA raycasting and
surrogate model raydrop. FPA enables the simulation of both point cloud
coordinates and sensor features, while taking into account reconstruction
noise. The ray-wise surrogate raydrop model mimics the physical properties of
LiDAR's laser receiver to determine whether a simulated point would be recorded
by a real LiDAR. With minimal training data, the surrogate model can generalize
to different geographies and scenes, closing the domain gap between raycasted
and real point clouds. To tackle the simulation of deformable VRU simulation,
we employ SMPL dataset to provide a pedestrian simulation baseline and compare
the domain gap between CAD and reconstructed objects. Applying our pipeline to
perform novel sensor synthesis, results show that object detection models
trained by simulation data can achieve similar result as the real data trained

However, dynamically optimizing CVaR is difficult since it is not a standard

In this paper, we study the infinite-horizon discrete-time MDP with a long-run
CVaR criterion, from the view of sensitivity-based optimization. By introducing
a pseudo CVaR metric, we derive a CVaR difference formula which quantifies the
difference of long-run CVaR under any two policies. The optimality of
deterministic policies is derived. We obtain a so-called Bellman local
optimality equation for CVaR, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for
local optimal policies and only necessary for global optimal policies. A CVaR
derivative formula is also derived for providing more sensitivity information.
Then we develop a policy iteration type algorithm to efficiently optimize CVaR,
which is shown to converge to local optima in the mixed policy space. We
further discuss some extensions including the mean-CVaR optimization and the
maximization of CVaR. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments relating to
portfolio management to demonstrate the main results. Our work may shed light

realized by subwavelength grating (SWG) metamaterials. The oscillating fields
in the SWGs enable coupling coefficients in each direction to counteract each

such an extraordinarily low coupling between closely spaced identical leaky SWG
waveguides, suppressing the crosstalk by $\approx$40 dB compared to
conventional strip waveguides, corresponding to $\approx$100 times longer

recent years, where labeled data are often expensive while unlabeled data can
be collected readily, calling for research on semi-supervised learning for this
area. Existing semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods usually assume
that the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same data distribution. In
autonomous driving, however, data are usually collected from different
scenarios, such as different weather conditions or different times in a day.
Motivated by this, we study a novel but challenging domain inconsistent SSOD
problem. It involves two kinds of distribution shifts among different domains,
including (1) data distribution discrepancy, and (2) class distribution shifts,
making existing SSOD methods suffer from inaccurate pseudo-labels and hurting
model performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, namely
Dual-Curriculum Teacher (DucTeacher). Specifically, DucTeacher consists of two
curriculums, i.e., (1) domain evolving curriculum seeks to learn from the data
progressively to handle data distribution discrepancy by estimating the
similarity between domains, and (2) distribution matching curriculum seeks to
estimate the class distribution for each unlabeled domain to handle class
distribution shifts. In this way, DucTeacher can calibrate biased pseudo-labels
and handle the domain-inconsistent SSOD problem effectively. DucTeacher shows
its advantages on SODA10M, the largest public semi-supervised autonomous
driving dataset, and COCO, a widely used SSOD benchmark. Experiments show that
DucTeacher achieves new state-of-the-art performance on SODA10M with 2.2 mAP

personality to behave like real users and further act as personal assistants.
Previous studies have explored generating implicit user profiles from the
user's dialogue history for building personalized chatbots. However, these
studies only use the response generation loss to train the entire model, thus
it is prone to suffer from the problem of data sparsity. Besides, they
overemphasize the final generated response's quality while ignoring the
correlations and fusions between the user's dialogue history, leading to rough
data representations and performance degradation. To tackle these problems, we
propose a self-supervised learning framework MCP for capturing better
representations from users' dialogue history for personalized chatbots.
Specifically, we apply contrastive sampling methods to leverage the supervised
signals hidden in user dialog history, and generate the pre-training samples
for enhancing the model. We design three pre-training tasks based on three
types of contrastive pairs from user dialogue history, namely response pairs,
sequence augmentation pairs, and user pairs. We pre-train the utterance encoder
and the history encoder towards the contrastive objectives and use these
pre-trained encoders for generating user profiles while personalized response

near the source. We study the filamentation of FRBs in the relativistic winds
of magnetars, which are commonly invoked as the most natural FRB progenitors.
As a result of filamentation, the particle number density and the radiation
intensity develop strong gradients along the direction of the wind magnetic
field. A steady state is reached when the plasma pressure balances the
ponderomotive force. In such a steady state, particles are confined into
periodically spaced thin sheets, and electromagnetic waves propagate between
them as in a waveguide. We show that: (i) The dispersion relation resembles
that in the initial homogeneous plasma, but the effective plasma frequency is
determined by the separation of the sheets, not directly by the mean particle
density. (ii) The contribution of relativistic magnetar winds to the dispersion
measure of FRBs could be several orders of magnitude larger than previously
thought. The dispersion measure of the wind depends on the properties of
individual bursts (e.g. the luminosity), and therefore can change significantly
among different bursts from repeating FRBs. (iii) Induced Compton scattering is
suppressed because most of the radiation propagates in near vacuum regions.

the emission spectra of such planets is still not understood. Due to huge
day-night temperature contrast in hot Jupiter, the thermal redistribution
through atmospheric circulation has a significant impact on the vertical
temperature-pressure structure and on the emission spectra. In the present
work, we aim to study the variation of the temperature-pressure profiles and
the emission spectra of such planets due to different amounts of atmospheric
heat redistribution. For this purpose, we first derive an analytical relation
between the heat redistribution parameter f and the emitted flux from the
uppermost atmospheric layers of hot Jupiter. We adopt the three possible values
of f under isotropic approximation as 1/4, 1/2, and 2/3 for
full-redistribution, semi-redistribution and no-redistribution cases
respectively and calculate the corresponding temperature-pressure profiles and
the emission spectra. Next, we model the emission spectra for different values
of f by numerically solving the radiative transfer equations using the discrete
space theory formalism. We demonstrate that the atmospheric
temperature-pressure profiles and the emission spectra both are susceptible to
the values of the heat redistribution function. A reduction in the heat
redistribution yields a thermal inversion in the temperature-pressure profiles
and hence increases the amount of emission flux. Finally, we revisits the hot
Jupiter XO-1b temperature-pressure profile degeneracy case and show that a
non-inversion temperature-pressure profile best explains this observed
planetary dayside emission spectra.

equation, and 2D momentum and energy equations in the anelastic approximation.
The initialization of BMR is modeled in the framework of Parker's magnetic
buoyancy instability. It defines the depths of BMR injections, which are
typically located at the edge of the global dynamo waves. The distribution with
longitude and latitude and the size of the initial BMR perturbations are taken
from the NOAA database of active regions. The tilt of the perturbations is
modeled by random function, and the mean tilt is modeled as a near-surface
helicity (alpha-effect) term. The data-driven models are compared with the
models calculated for random longitudinal and latitudinal distributions of the
initial perturbation. The modeling results are compared with various observed
characteristics of the solar cycles, including the magnetic butterfly diagram,
the polar magnetic and basal magnetic fluxes, and the probability distributions
of the BMR flux on the surface. Our results show that BMR can play a
substantial role in the dynamo processes, and affect the strength of the solar
cycle. However, the data-driven model shows that the BMR effect alone cannot
explain the weak Cycle 24. This weak cycle and the prolonged preceding minimum
of magnetic activity were probably caused by a decrease of the turbulent

this question by proposing an implicit neural signal processing network, dubbed
INSP-Net, via differential operators on INR. Our key insight is that spatial
gradients of neural networks can be computed analytically and are invariant to
translation, while mathematically we show that any continuous convolution
filter can be uniformly approximated by a linear combination of high-order

processing operator as a weighted composition of computational graphs
corresponding to the high-order derivatives of INRs, where the weighting
parameters can be data-driven learned. Based on our proposed INSP-Net, we
further build the first Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that implicitly runs

  arXiv:2101.01966",,,,"math.FA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we describe the Grothendieck groups $K_1(V)$ and $K(V)$ of an
absolute matrix order unit space $V$ for unitary and partial unitary elements
respectively. For this purpose, we study some basic properties of unitary and
partial unitary elements, and define their path homotopy equivalence. The
construction of $K(V)$ follows in a almost similar manner as that of $K_1(V).$
We prove that $K_1(V)$ and $K(V)$ are ordered abelian groups. We also prove
that $K_1(V)$ and $K(V)$ are functors from the category of absolute matrix
order unit spaces with morphisms as unital completely $\vert \cdot
\vert$-preserving maps to the category of ordered abelian groups. Later, we
show that under certain conditions, quotient of $K(V)$ is isomorphic to the
direct sum of $K_0(V)$ and $K_1(V),$ where $K_0(V)$ is the Grothendieck group
for order projections.

charger and battery are immersed in nonequilbrium boson or fermion reservoirs.
Based on the Redfield master equation, we consider the change of the energy
spectrum induced by the external driving to the charger. When the charger and
the battery possess the same transition frequency and the charger is driven in
resonance, a bistability can emerge with the closure of the Liouvillian gap. As
a result, the efficiency of the battery depends on the initial state of the
charger-battery system, and certain types of entangled initial states can
enhance the efficiency. In the non-resonance driving regime, the efficiency of
the quantum battery can be optimized by the compensation mechanism for both the
boson and fermion reservoirs. Our investigation is helpful to the design and
optimization of quantum battery in the nonequlibrium open system.

the universality class of the transition. It is found by means of the hybrid
Monte-Carlo and spin-dynamics simulations that in the $XY$ and Heisenberg cases
of $\Delta \leq 1$, the longitudinal spin conductivity $\sigma^s_{\mu\mu}$
exhibits a divergent enhancement on cooling toward $T_N$, while not in the

the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\mu\mu}$ is featureless at $T_N$, being
consistent with experimental results. The divergent enhancement of
$\sigma^s_{\mu\mu}$ toward $T_N$ is attributed to the spin-current relaxation
time which gets longer toward $T_N$, showing a power-law divergence
characteristic of critical phenomena. It is also found that in contrast to the

predictive control (MPC) for cable-actuated soft robotics using Bayesian
optimization. Instead of modeling the complex dynamics of the soft robots, the
proposed approach uses Bayesian optimization to search the best-guessed
low-dimensional prediction model and its associated controller to minimize the
objective function of closed-loop responses. The prediction model is updated by
Bayesian optimization from the closed-loop input-output data in each iteration.
A linear MPC is then designed based on the updated prediction model, and
evaluated based on the closed-loop responses. Different from directly searching
controller parameters, the closed-loop system stability, and inputs/outputs
constraints can be easily handled in the MPC design. After a few iterations, a
convergent solution of a (sub-)optimal controller can be obtained, which
minimizes the user-defined closed-loop performance index. The proposed method
is simulated and validated by a high-fidelity simulation of a cable-actuated
soft robot. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can
achieve desired tracking controller for the soft robot without a prior-known
model.

systems. In such applications, a major concern is that these models sometimes
discriminate against certain demographic groups such as individuals with
certain race, gender, or age. Another major concern in these applications is
the violation of the privacy of users. While fair learning algorithms have been
developed to mitigate discrimination issues, these algorithms can still leak
sensitive information, such as individuals' health or financial records.
Utilizing the notion of differential privacy (DP), prior works aimed at
developing learning algorithms that are both private and fair. However,
existing algorithms for DP fair learning are either not guaranteed to converge
or require full batch of data in each iteration of the algorithm to converge.
In this paper, we provide the first stochastic differentially private algorithm
for fair learning that is guaranteed to converge. Here, the term ""stochastic""
refers to the fact that our proposed algorithm converges even when minibatches
of data are used at each iteration (i.e. stochastic optimization). Our
framework is flexible enough to permit different fairness notions, including
demographic parity and equalized odds. In addition, our algorithm can be
applied to non-binary classification tasks with multiple (non-binary) sensitive
attributes. As a byproduct of our convergence analysis, we provide the first
utility guarantee for a DP algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave
min-max problems. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm
consistently offers significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art
baselines, and can be applied to larger scale problems with non-binary

country using correlations, ordinal regressions and multinomial logistic
regressions. Of the 608 clusters, 115 received the same ratings from human
experts and the independent DHS rankings. For 59 percent of the clusters,
experts ratings were slightly lower. On the one hand, significant positive
predictors of wealth are the presence of modern roofs and wider roads. For
instance, the log odds of receiving a rating in a higher quintile on the wealth
rankings is 0.917 points higher on average for clusters with buildings with
slate or tile roofing compared to those without. On the other hand, significant
negative predictors included poor road coverage, low to medium greenery
coverage, and low to medium building density. Other key predictors from the
multinomial regression model include settlement structure and farm sizes. These
findings are significant to the extent that these correlates of wealth and
poverty are visually readable from satellite imagery and can be used to train
machine learning models in poverty predictions. Using these features for
training will contribute to more transparent ML models and, consequently,
explainable AI.

learning paradigm to alleviate the reliance on labelling information for graph
representation learning. The core of GCL is to maximise the mutual information
between the representation of a node and its contextual representation (i.e.,
the corresponding instance with similar semantic information) summarised from
the contextual scope (e.g., the whole graph or 1-hop neighbourhood). This
scheme distils valuable self-supervision signals for GCL training. However,
existing GCL methods still suffer from limitations, such as the incapacity or
inconvenience in choosing a suitable contextual scope for different datasets
and building biased contrastiveness. To address aforementioned problems, we
present a simple self-supervised learning method termed Unifying Graph
Contrastive Learning with Flexible Contextual Scopes (UGCL for short). Our
algorithm builds flexible contextual representations with tunable contextual
scopes by controlling the power of an adjacency matrix. Additionally, our
method ensures contrastiveness is built within connected components to reduce
the bias of contextual representations. Based on representations from both
local and contextual scopes, UGCL optimises a very simple contrastive loss
function for graph representation learning. Essentially, the architecture of
UGCL can be considered as a general framework to unify existing GCL methods. We
have conducted intensive experiments and achieved new state-of-the-art
performance in six out of eight benchmark datasets compared with
self-supervised graph representation learning baselines. Our code has been

the individuals in the same group often follow significantly different
patterns. In this paper, we present a novel formulation for multi-agent
trajectory prediction, which explicitly introduces the concept of interactive
group consensus via an interactive hierarchical latent space. This formulation
allows group-level and individual-level interactions to be captured jointly,
thus substantially improving the capability of modeling complex dynamics. On
two multi-agent settings, i.e. team sports and pedestrians, the proposed
framework consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing
methods.

observed in between the slabs have correlations with the pattern observed at
the receiver, after two slabs? To this end, we send spatially shaped wavefronts
from the sender that are designed to arrive at the receiver in one of two

the intermediate speckle patterns corresponding to either of the two states and
study their properties. We characterize the correlation distribution between

has attracted much attention due to its ability to discover personalized
communities with a wide range of applications. Given any query nodes, CS seeks
to find a densely connected subgraph containing query nodes. Most existing
approaches usually study networks with a single type of proximity between
nodes, which defines a single view of a network. However, in many applications
such as biological, social, and transportation networks, interactions between
objects span multiple aspects, yielding networks with multiple views, called
multiplex networks. Existing CS approaches in multiplex networks adopt
pre-defined subgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find
communities that do not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world networks.
In this paper, we propose a query-driven graph convolutional network in

learning from the ground-truth communities in a data-driven fashion. CS-MLGCN
first combines the local query-dependent structure and global graph embedding

developing a strong and effective screen content image (SCI) super-resolution

deconvolution or pixel shuffle) could be harmful to sharp and thin edges in
SCIs, and the fixed scale upsampler makes it inflexible to fit screens with
various sizes. To solve this problem, we propose an implicit transformer
network for continuous SCI SR (termed as ITSRN++). Specifically, we propose a
modulation based transformer as the upsampler, which modulates the pixel
features in discrete space via a periodic nonlinear function to generate
features for continuous pixels. To enhance the extracted features, we further
propose an enhanced transformer as the feature extraction backbone, where
convolution and attention branches are utilized parallelly. Besides, we

lower dimension such that what remains is diffeomorphic to ${\mathbb R}^{2d}$
which we identify with ${\mathbb C}^d$ and embed in ${\mathbb C}P^d$. A local
Poisson structure and Berezin-type quantization are induced from ${\mathbb
C}P^d$. We have a Hilbert space with a reproducing kernel. The symbols of
bounded linear operators on the Hilbert space have a star product which
satisfies the correspondence principle outside a set of measure zero. This
construction depends on the diffeomorphism. However, suppose $X= M \setminus
M_0$ has a complex structure and we have from $X \setminus X_0$, ($X_0$ a set
of measure zero or empty) a biholomorphism from it to ${\mathbb C}^d \setminus
N_0$, (where $N_0$ is of measure zero or empty). As before we embed ${\mathbb
C}^d \setminus N_0$ in ${\mathbb C}^d$ and then into ${\mathbb C}P^d$ and we
have a Berezin-type quantization induced from ${\mathbb C}P^d$. If we use
another biholomorphism, we have a map of the two Hilbert spaces under
consideration such that the reproducing kernel of one maps to the reproducing
kernel of the other and we have an equivalent quantization. We have a similar
construction where we consider an arbitrary complex manifold and use local
coordinates to induce the quantization from ${\mathbb C}P^d$. We study the
possibility of defining a global Berezin quantization on compact complex
manifolds. We give a defintion of pullback Toeplitz operators and exhibit
Toeplitz quantization of compact even dimensional manifolds after removing a
set of measure zero. Next we give a simple construction of pullback coherent
states on compact smooth manifolds which are simplified versions of those
defined in an earlier work by the authors.

recurrent issue of controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR) in
peptide-spectrum-match (PSM) validation. Briefly, they proposed to derive a
single precise distribution of decoy matches termed the Common Decoy
Distribution (CDD) and to use it to control for FDR during a target-only
search. Conceptually, this approach is appealing as it takes the best of two
worlds, i.e., decoy-based approaches (which leverage a large-scale collection
of empirical mismatches) and decoy-free approaches (which are not subject to
the randomness of decoy generation while sparing an additional database
search). Interestingly, CDD also corresponds to a middle-of-the-road approach
in statistics with respect to the two main families of FDR control procedures:
Although historically based on estimating the falsepositive distribution, FDR
control has recently been demonstrated to be possible thanks to competition
between the original variables (in proteomics, target sequences) and their
fictional counterparts (in proteomics, decoys). Discriminating between these
two theoretical trends is of prime importance for computational proteomics. In
addition to highlighting why proteomics was a source of inspiration for
theoretical biostatistics, it provides practical insights into the improvements
that can be made to FDR control methods used in proteomics, including CDD.

of air in a laterally heated cube with perfectly thermally insulated horizontal

Arnoldi methods based on Krylov subspace iteration. The finite volume grid is
gradually refined from 100^3 to 256^3 finite volumes. It is shown that the
primary instability is characterized by two competing eigenmodes, whose
temporal development results in two different oscillatory states that differ by
their symmetries. Bifurcations due to both modes are subcritical. These modes
develop into different oscillatory and then stochastic flow states, which, at
larger Grashof number, stabilize and arrive to single stable steady flow. With
further increase of the Grashof number this flow loses it stability again. It
is argued that in all the three transitions, the instabilities onsets, as well
as reinstatement of stability, take place owing to an interaction between a
destabilizing centrifugal mechanism and stabilizing effect of thermal
stratification.

instead of a single modality-shared one, which alleviates the modality
interference. Based on these embeddings, in the inference phase, we first make
modality-split predictions and then exploit various ensemble methods to combine
the predictions with different weights, which models the modality importance
dynamically. Experimental results on three KG datasets show that MoSE

parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g., Adapter or VPT) that introduce
the extra parameters and computational cost in the training and inference
stages, SSF only adds learnable parameters during the training stage, and these
additional parameters can be merged into the original pre-trained model weights
via re-parameterization in the inference phase. With the proposed SSF, our

shown to be useful when dealing with instance-dependent label noise problems.
Furthermore, methods that do aim to learn this relationship require cleanly
annotated subsets of data, as well as distillation or multi-faceted models for

simple model to learn the relationship between clean and noisy labels without
the need for a cleanly labelled subset of data. Our algorithm follows a 3-stage
process, namely: 1) self-supervised pre-training followed by an early-stopping
training of the classifier to confidently predict clean labels for a subset of
the training set; 2) use the clean set from stage (1) to bootstrap the
relationship between images, noisy labels and clean labels, which we exploit
for effective relabelling of the remaining training set using semi-supervised
learning; and 3) supervised training of the classifier with all relabelled
samples from stage (2). By learning this relationship, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance in asymmetric and instance-dependent label noise

the verification performances are still far behind the real usage owing to the
small scale of the datasets as well as the limited biometric mediums.
Therefore, this paper proposes a new handwriting verification benchmark dataset
named Multimodal Signature and Digit String (MSDS), which consists of two
subsets: MSDS-ChS (Chinese Signatures) and MSDS-TDS (Token Digit Strings),
contributed by 402 users, with 20 genuine samples and 20 skilled forgeries per
user per subset. MSDS-ChS consists of handwritten Chinese signatures, which, to
the best of our knowledge, is the largest publicly available Chinese signature
dataset for handwriting verification, at least eight times larger than existing
online datasets. Meanwhile, MSDS-TDS consists of handwritten Token Digit
Strings, i.e, the actual phone numbers of users, which have not been explored
yet. Extensive experiments with different baselines are respectively conducted
for MSDS-ChS and MSDS-TDS. Surprisingly, verification performances of
state-of-the-art methods on MSDS-TDS are generally better than those on
MSDS-ChS, which indicates that the handwritten Token Digit String could be a
more effective biometric than handwritten Chinese signature. This is a
promising discovery that could inspire us to explore new biometric traits. The

maintains a loss of orthogonality below $O(u)\kappa(\mathcal{X})$. This

equilibrium through a variational system satisfied by the players' equilibrium
value functions. This result contrasts with the literature, which focuses on
pure-strategy equilibria, or, in the case of symmetric players, on
mixed-strategy equilibria with absolutely continuous stopping intensities. We
illustrate this result by revisiting the model of exit in a duopoly under

estimates are constant-free in the leading term, locally efficient, and robust

number of hanging nodes arising in adaptive mesh refinement employing
hierarchical B-splines. Two partitions of unity are designed, one with larger
supports corresponding to the mapped splines, and one with small supports
corresponding to mapped piecewise affine polynomials. The equilibration is only
performed on the small supports, avoiding the higher computational price of
equilibration on the large supports or even a global system solve. Thus, the
derived estimates are also as inexpensive as possible. An abstract framework
for such a setting is developed, whose application to a specific situation only
requests a verification of a few clearly identified assumptions. Numerical

Data Augmentation (PeerDA) approach is proposed which employs span pairs with
the PR relation as the augmentation data for training. PeerDA has two unique
advantages: (1) There are a large number of PR span pairs for augmenting the
training data. (2) The augmented data can prevent the trained model from
over-fitting the superficial span-category mapping by pushing the model to
leverage the span semantics. Experimental results on ten datasets over four
diverse tasks across seven domains demonstrate the effectiveness of PeerDA.
Notably, PeerDA achieves state-of-the-art results on six of them.

vast researchers' focus on architecture modeling to boost performance. Though
great advances achieved in online and offline paradigms, there are still
insufficient means to identify model errors and distinguish discrepancies
between methods, as well approaches that correctly reflect models' performance
in recognizing object instances of various temporal lengths remain barely
available. More importantly, as the fundamental model abilities demanded by the
task, spatial segmentation and temporal association are still understudied in
both evaluation and interaction mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce TIVE, a
Toolbox for Identifying Video instance segmentation Errors. By directly
operating output prediction files, TIVE defines isolated error types and
weights each type's damage to mAP, for the purpose of distinguishing model
characters. By decomposing localization quality in spatial-temporal dimensions,
model's potential drawbacks on spatial segmentation and temporal association
can be revealed. TIVE can also report mAP over instance temporal length for
real applications. We conduct extensive experiments by the toolbox to further
illustrate how spatial segmentation and temporal association affect each other.
We expect the analysis of TIVE can give the researchers more insights, guiding
the community to promote more meaningful explorations for video instance
segmentation. The proposed toolbox is available at

addition to each other's strategic decisions, the players must also contend
with the fact that the game itself evolves over time, possibly in a very
complicated manner. Because of this, the convergence properties of popular
learning algorithms - like policy gradient and its variants - are poorly
understood, except in specific classes of games (such as potential or
two-player, zero-sum games). In view of this, we examine the long-run behavior
of policy gradient methods with respect to Nash equilibrium policies that are
second-order stationary (SOS) in a sense similar to the type of sufficiency
conditions used in optimization. Our first result is that SOS policies are
locally attracting with high probability, and we show that policy gradient
trajectories with gradient estimates provided by the REINFORCE algorithm
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ distance-squared convergence rate if the
method's step-size is chosen appropriately. Subsequently, specializing to the
class of deterministic Nash policies, we show that this rate can be improved
dramatically and, in fact, policy gradient methods converge within a finite
number of iterations in that case.

microfluidics where they can serve as microreactors for screening of chemical
reactions. They are often formed out of a constriction (a microfluidic channel
or a cylindrical tube) by blowing a given volume of gas into a liquid phase. It
is obviously crucial to be able to control their size, which is not always easy
due to the coupling between the volume of the bubble and the gas pressure
induced by the Laplace law. In this paper, we examine the size and formation
dynamics of soap bubbles blown from a cylindrical tube, which is the paradigm
geometry for bubble and droplet formation. To do so, one end of the tube is
closed by a soap film, while the other end is connected to a large reservoir of
variable volume filled with gas. To inflate the gas in the bubble, we reduce
the volume of the reservoir, which mimics air inflation through the lung
diaphragm or the flow-rate driven bubble formation in microfluidics geometry
such as flow-focusing. As the volume of the reservoir decreases, the gas
pressure increases, the soap film curves and takes the form of a spherical cap
with an increasingly smaller radius of curvature. This quasi-static process
continues until a critical pressure is reached for which the bubble is
quasi-hemispherical. Beyond this pressure, the film undergoes a rapid
topological transformation and swells very rapidly (in less than a hundred ms)
until it reaches its final volume. We describe this instability in particular
by showing that this unstable regime appears when a dimensionless number -
whose expression we specify - reaches a critical value. Using a quasi-static
model that we solve analytically, we predict the bubble growth dynamics and the
final height of the bubble produced for any reservoir volume and constriction
size.

decoherence. On the other hand, much effort has been paid into the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computation research. For practical NISQ

performant policy that can repeatedly and autonomously complete a task, usually
starting from scratch. However, in many real-world situations, the goal might
not be to learn a policy that can do the task repeatedly, but simply to perform
a new task successfully once in a single trial. For example, imagine a disaster
relief robot tasked with retrieving an item from a fallen building, where it
cannot get direct supervision from humans. It must retrieve this object within
one test-time trial, and must do so while tackling unknown obstacles, though it
may leverage knowledge it has of the building before the disaster. We formalize
this problem setting, which we call single-life reinforcement learning (SLRL),
where an agent must complete a task within a single episode without
interventions, utilizing its prior experience while contending with some form
of novelty. SLRL provides a natural setting to study the challenge of
autonomously adapting to unfamiliar situations, and we find that algorithms
designed for standard episodic reinforcement learning often struggle to recover

we propose an algorithm, $Q$-weighted adversarial learning (QWALE), which
employs a distribution matching strategy that leverages the agent's prior

the camouflage texture, which can be rendered over the surface of the object.
In the first stage, we optimize the global texture to minimize the discrepancy

to distinguish. In the second stage, we design three loss functions to optimize
the local texture, making object detectors ineffective. In addition, we
introduce the differential evolution algorithm to search for the near-optimal

textures, referring to $\vec{k}$-dependent orbital states. Most of previous
works are based on symmetry analysis to model the orbital texture and analyze
its consequences. However the microscopic origins of orbital texture and its
strength are largely unexplored. In this work, we derive the orbital texture
Hamiltonians from microscopic tight-binding models for various situations. To
form an orbital texture, $\vec{k}$-dependent hybridization of orbital states
are necessary. We reveal two microscopic mechanisms for the hybridization: (i)
lattice structure effect and (ii) mediation by other orbital states. By
considering the orbital hybridization, we not only reproduce the orbital
Hamiltonian obtained by the symmetry analysis but also reveal previously
unreported orbital textures like orbital Dresselhaus texture and anisotropic
orbital texture. The orbital Hamiltonians obtained here would be useful for
analyzing the orbital physics and designing the materials suitable for
spin-orbitronic applications. We show that our theory also provides useful
microscopic insight into physical phenomena such as the orbital Rashba effect
and the orbital Hall effect. Our formalism is so generalizable that one can
apply it to obtain effective orbital Hamiltonians for arbitrary orbitals in the
presence of periodic lattice structures.

formation history. However, abundances inferred from Ti I and Ti II lines can
be in stark disagreement in very metal-poor giants. Departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) have a large impact on the minority neutral
species and thus influences the ionisation imbalance, but satisfactory non-LTE
modelling for both dwarfs and giants has not been achieved in previous
literature. The reliability of titanium abundances is reassessed in benchmark
dwarfs and giants using a new non-LTE model and one-dimensional (1D) model
atmospheres. A comprehensive model atom was compiled with a more extended level
structure and newly published data for inelastic collisions between Ti I and
neutral hydrogen. In 1D LTE, the Ti I and Ti II lines agree to within $0.06$
dex for the Sun, Arcturus, and the very metal-poor stars HD84937 and HD140283.
For the very metal-poor giant HD122563, the Ti I lines give an abundance that
is $0.47$ dex lower than that from Ti II. The 1D non-LTE corrections can reach
$+0.4$ dex for individual Ti I lines and $+0.1$ dex for individual Ti II lines,
and reduce the overall ionisation imbalance to $-0.17$ dex for HD122563.
However, it also increases the imbalance for the very metal-poor dwarf and
sub-giant to around $0.2$ dex. Using 1D non-LTE reduces the ionisation
imbalance in very metal-poor giants but breaks the balance of other very
metal-poor stars, consistent with the conclusions in earlier literature. To
make further progress, consistent 3D non-LTE models are needed.

We discuss some conceptual foundation for a clinical implementation of a

example. Our analysis shows how the risk evaluation in this framework can
accommodate machine learning systems independently of their robustness

state-of-art domain adaptation methods and show that it has almost the same
expressiveness as the full parameter space. Additionally, we propose a new
regularization loss that considerably enhances the diversity of the fine-tuned
generator. Inspired by the reduction in the size of the optimizing parameter
space we consider the problem of multi-domain adaptation of GANs, i.e. setting
when the same model can adapt to several domains depending on the input query.
We propose the HyperDomainNet that is a hypernetwork that predicts our
parameterization given the target domain. We empirically confirm that it can
successfully learn a number of domains at once and may even generalize to
unseen domains. Source code can be found at

results highlight features that are important to consider when modelling
testing interventions, including population heterogeneity of infectiousness and
correlation with test-positive probability, as well as adherence behaviours in

transmission potential presented here can be used to parameterise existing
epidemiological models without them having to explicitly simulate the testing

the physics of electrons in the two-dimensional copper-oxide planes of
high-$T_c$ cuprates. To get approximate solutions, we employ functional
renormalization group (fRG) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) methods.
  We deal with the problem of identifying bosonic fluctuations in the vertex
function, exhibiting an intricate dependence on momenta and frequencies already
at moderate coupling. In the normal, paramagnetic phase, the goal is achieved
by employing the recently introduced single-boson exchange decomposition. In
the symmetry-broken phases, we reformulate the previously introduced
combination of fRG with mean-field theory by explicitly introducing a bosonic
field.
  A widely discussed and challenging problem is the emergence of a pseudogap in
the Hubbard model. In this thesis we assume this phase to be characterized by
strong magnetic fluctuations. Following previous works, we fractionalize the
electron in a chargon, carrying the electron's charge, and a charge neutral
spinon, which represents local fluctuations of the spin orientation. The
chargons undergo N\'eel or spiral magnetic order below a density-dependent
transition temperature $T^*$. We compute DC charge transport coefficients for
the chargons, and obtain a pronounced drop in the charge carrier density across
the magnetic-to-paramagnetic transition. Directional fluctuations of the spin
orientation are described by a non-linear sigma model and prevent long-range
ordering of the electrons at any finite temperature. The phase where the
chargon degrees of freedom are magnetically ordered shares many features with
the pseudogap regime observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates: a strong reduction of the
charge carrier density, a spin gap, Fermi arcs, and electronic nematicity.

The calculations are performed within the $k_T$-factorization approach and the
hybrid model using different unintegrated parton distribution functions (uPDFs)

compare our results to the LHCb data for forward $D^{0}$-meson production at

The IC and recombination models are negligible at the LHCb kinematics. Both the
mechanisms start to be crucial at larger rapidities and dominate over the
standard charm production mechanisms. At high energies there are so far no
experiments probing this region. We present also energy distributions for
forward electron, muon and tau neutrinos to be measured at the LHC by the
currently operating FASER$\nu$ experiment, as well as by future experiments

separately. For all kinds of neutrinos (electron, muon, tau) the subleading
contributions, i.e. the IC and/or the recombination, dominate over light meson
(pion, kaon) and the standard charm production contribution driven by fusion of
gluons for neutrino energies $E_{\nu} \gtrsim 300$ GeV. For electron and muon
neutrinos both the mechanisms lead to a similar production rates and their
separation seems rather impossible. On the other hand, for $\nu_{\tau} + {\bar

measurement of the IC contribution very attractive.

Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV, in the dimuon decay channel.
A significant signal was observed for the first time at LHC energies down to
zero transverse momentum, at forward rapidity ($2.5<y<4$). The measurement of
the ratio of the inclusive production cross sections of the $\psi(2S)$ and
J/$\psi$ resonances is reported as a function of the centrality of the
collisions and of transverse momentum, in the region $p_{\rm T}<12$ GeV/$c$.
The results are compared with the corresponding measurements in pp collisions,
by forming the double ratio
$[\sigma^{\psi(2S)}/\sigma^{J/\psi}]_{\rm{Pb-Pb}}/[\sigma^{\psi(2S)}/\sigma^{J/\psi}]_{\rm{pp}}$.
The $\psi(2S)$ nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ was also obtained as a
function of both centrality and $p_{\rm T}$. The results show that the
$\psi(2S)$ resonance yield is strongly suppressed in Pb-Pb collisions, by a
factor up to $\sim 3$ with respect to pp. Furthermore, the $\psi(2S)$
suppression in Pb-Pb collisions is stronger than the one observed for the
J/$\psi$ by a factor $\sim 2$. Comparisons of cross section ratios with
previous SPS findings by the NA50 experiment, and of $R_{\rm AA}$ with
higher-$p_{\rm T}$ results at LHC energy are also reported. These results and

responses. The goal is therefore to identify dose combination(s) with a
prespecified desirable risk-benefit trade-off. We propose a flexible cubic
spline to model the marginal distribution of the efficacy response. In stage I,
patients are allocated following the escalation with overdose control (EWOC)

available experimental dose combinations based on the continuously updated
model parameters. A simulation study is presented to assess the design's
performance under different scenarios, as well as to evaluate its sensitivity
to the sample size and to model misspecification. Compared to a recently
published dose finding algorithm for biologic drugs, our design is safer and
more efficient at identifying optimal dose combinations.

percolation (CPDLP) defined on a complete graph $(V,\mathcal{E})$. A dynamical
long range percolation is a Feller process defined on the edge set
$\mathcal{E}$, which assigns to each edge the state of being open or closed
independently. The state of an edge $e$ is updated at rate $v_e$ and is open
after the update with probability $p_e$ and closed otherwise. The contact
process is then defined on top of this evolving random environment using only
open edges for infection while recovery is independent of the background.
First, we conclude that an upper invariant law exists and that the phase
transitions of survival and non-triviality of the upper invariant coincide. We
then formulate a comparison with a contact process with a specific infection
kernel which acts as a lower bound. Thus, we obtain an upper bound for the
critical infection rate. We also show that if the probability that an edge is
open is low for all edges then the CPDLP enters an immunization phase, i.e. it
will not survive regardless of the value of the infection rate. Furthermore, we
show that on $V=\mathbb{Z}$ and under suitable conditions on the rates of the
dynamical long range percolation the CPDLP will almost surely die out if the
update speed converges to zero for any given infection rate $\lambda$.

lies in jointly learning the visual and textual representation to accurately

object-word based attention to calculate their relevance scores and refine
their interactive representations with the attention features, which, however,
neglects the context of the object representation on the inter-object
relationship that matches the predicates in sentences. In this paper, we
propose a Cross-modal Semantic Enhanced Interaction method, termed CMSEI for
image-sentence retrieval, which correlates the intra- and inter-modal semantics
between objects and words. In particular, we first design the intra-modal
spatial and semantic graphs based reasoning to enhance the semantic
representations of objects guided by the explicit relationships of the objects'
spatial positions and their scene graph. Then the visual and textual semantic
representations are refined jointly via the inter-modal interactive attention
and the cross-modal alignment. To correlate the context of objects with the
textual context, we further refine the visual semantic representation via the
cross-level object-sentence and word-image based interactive attention.
Experimental results on seven standard evaluation metrics show that the
proposed CMSEI outperforms the state-of-the-art and the alternative approaches

$4320^3$ particles resolving dark matter haloes to masses of
$5\times10^8~h^{-1}~M_\odot$. To reach the mass resolution of atomically cooled

at $z=20$ of $\sim 2\times10^7~h^{-1}~M_\odot$, we augment this simulation
using the DARKFOREST Monte-Carlo merger tree algorithm (achieving an effective
particle count of $\sim10^{12}$). Using this augmented simulation we explore
the impact of mass resolution on the predicted reionisation history as well as
the impact of X-ray heating on the 21-cm global signal and the 21-cm power

$70^{3}$ $h^{-3}$ Mpc$^3$ sub-volumes. We find that the midpoint of
reionisation varies by $\Delta z\sim0.8$ and that the cosmic variance on the
power spectrum is underestimated by a factor of $2-4$ at $k\sim 0.1-0.4$

planets based on TESS data. Shortly after, the transit of an additional planet
with a period of 29.54d was serendipitously detected by CHEOPS. In this way,
HD108236 (V=9.2) became one of the brightest stars known to host five small
transiting planets (R$_p$<3R$_{\oplus}$). We characterize the planetary system
by using all the data available from CHEOPS and TESS space missions. We use the
flexible pointing capabilities of CHEOPS to follow up the transits of all the
planets in the system, including the fifth transiting body. After updating the
host star parameters by using the results from Gaia eDR3, we analyzed 16 and 43
transits observed by CHEOPS and TESS, respectively, to derive the planets
physical and orbital parameters. We carried out a timing analysis of the
transits of each of the planets of HD108236 to search for the presence of
transit timing variations. We derived improved values for the radius and mass
of the host star (R$_{\star}$=0.876$\pm$0.007 R$_{\odot}$ and
M$_{\star}$=0.867$_{-0.046}^{+0.047}$ M$_{\odot}$). We confirm the presence of
the fifth transiting planet f in a 29.54d orbit. Thus, the system consists of
five planets of R$_b$=1.587$\pm$0.028, R$_c$=2.122$\pm$0.025,
R$_d$=2.629$\pm$0.031, R$_e$=3.008$\pm$0.032, and R$_f$=1.89$\pm$0.04
[R$_{\oplus}$]. We refine the transit ephemeris for each planet and find no
significant transit timing variations for planets c, d, and e. For planets b
and f, instead, we measure significant deviations on their transit times (up to
22 and 28 min, respectively) with a non-negligible dispersion of 9.6 and 12.6
min in their time residuals. We confirm the presence of planet f and find no
significant evidence for a potential transiting planet in a 10.9d orbital
period, as previously suggested. Full abstract in the PDF file.

flow poses several challenges, amongst which is resolving the relatively thin
shear layer at the interface. To this end we propose a sharp discretisation of
the two-velocity model of the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations. This results
in the ability to model the shear layer, rather than resolving it, by allowing
for a velocity discontinuity in the direction(s) tangential to the interface.
  In a previous paper (Remmerswaal and Veldman (2022), arXiv:2209.14934) we
have discussed the transport of mass and momentum, where the two fluids were
not yet coupled. In this paper an implicit coupling of the two fluids is
proposed, which imposes continuity of the velocity field in the interface
normal direction. The coupling is included in the pressure Poisson problem, and
is discretised using a multidimensional generalisation of the ghost fluid
method. Furthermore, a discretisation of the diffusive forces is proposed,
which leads to recovering the continuous one-velocity solution as the interface
shear layer is resolved.
  The proposed two-velocity formulation is validated and compared to our
one-velocity formulation, where we consider a multitude of two-phase flow
problems. It is demonstrated that the proposed two-velocity model is able to
consistently, and sharply, approximate solutions to the inviscid Euler
equations, where velocity discontinuities appear analytically as well.
Furthermore, the proposed two-velocity model is shown to accurately model the
interface shear layer in viscous problems, and it is successfully applied to
the simulation of breaking waves where the model was used to sharply capture
free surface instabilities.

defined on AdS boundary of which shapes are wide and thin slabs and a cylinder.
It turns out that the entanglement entropies near the critical point shows
scaling behavior such that for both of the slabs and cylinder,
$\Delta_\varepsilon S\sim\left(1-\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^\beta$ and the critical
exponent $\beta=1$, where $\Delta_\varepsilon S\equiv S^{iso}-S^{aniso}$, and
$S^{iso}$ denotes the entanglement entropy in isotropic phase whereas
$S^{aniso}$ denotes that in anisotropic phase. We suggest a quantity
$O_{12}\equiv S_1-S_2$ as a new order parameter near the critical point, where
$S_1$ is entanglement entropy when the slab is perpendicular to the direction
of the vector order whereas $S_2$ is that when the slab is parallel to the
vector order. $O_{12}=0$ in isotropic phase but in anisotropic phase, the order
parameter becomes non-zero showing the same scaling behavior. Finally, we show
that even near the critical point, the first law of entanglement entropy is

violin making in the human history. Luthiers and researchers endeavor to study
his legendary legacy. Unfortunately, a consensus that the present progress has
reached his level remains lacking. Most of the instruments suffer from low
sounding power and enigmatic deficit of harmonic overtones. In fact, there is
significant energy dissipation in the acoustic couplings in the violin family,
completely unaware to luthiers and researchers. The current acoustic mechanism
is inefficient in resonance of the wooden plates and hence is the low rate of
mechanical energy conversion to the desired sound. We propose a new method for
the amelioration of the acoustic couplings to enhance the preservation of the
overtone components up to 161% of the pristine and to reduce the instrumental
dissipation intensity up to 3.8 dB off (73% off). It results in the
tremendously improved sound projection, the shorter reaction time, the longer
reverberation time, and consequently the enrichment of the timbre complexity.
Our physical method is applicable to the violin family of all sizes and ages,

corresponding to each training sample, ensuring high diversity in the feature
space of the pretrained classifier. We train the denoiser by maximizing the
similarity between the denoised output of the generated sample and the original
training sample in the classifier's logit space. We also perform distribution
level matching using domain discriminator and maximum mean discrepancy that
yields further benefit. In white box setup, we obtain significant improvements
over the baseline on multiple benchmark datasets and also report similar
performance under the challenging black box setup.

  in three-arm non-inferiority trials",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Three-arm `gold-standard' non-inferiority trials are recommended for
indications where only unstable reference treatments are available and the use
of a placebo group can be justified ethically. For such trials several study
designs have been suggested that use the placebo group for testing 'assay
sensitivity', i.e. the ability of the trial to replicate efficacy. Should the
reference fail in the given trial, then non-inferiority could also be shown
with an ineffective experimental treatment and hence becomes useless. In this
paper we extend the so called Koch-R\""ohmel design where a proof of efficacy
for the experimental treatment is required in order to qualify the
non-inferiority test. While efficacy of the experimental treatment is an
indication for assay sensitivity, it does not guarantee that the reference is
sufficient efficient to let the non-inferiority claim be meaningful. It has
therefore been suggested to adaptively test non-inferiority only if the
reference demonstrates superiority to placebo and otherwise to test
$\delta$-superiority of the experimental treatment over placebo, where $\delta$
is chosen in such a way that it provides proof of non-inferiority with regard
to the reference's historical effect. In this paper we extend the previous work
by complementing its adaptive test with compatible simultaneous confidence
intervals. Confidence intervals are commonly used and suggested by regulatory
guidelines for non-inferiority trials. We show how to adopt different
approaches to simultaneous confidence intervals from the literature to the
setting of three-arm non-inferiority trials and compare these methods in a
simulation study. Finally we apply these methods to a real clinical trial

concurrency. Existing networked storage systems (e.g., NVMe over Fabrics) fail
to fully exploit these new devices due to inefficient storage ordering
guarantees. Severe synchronous execution for storage order in these systems
stalls the CPU and I/O devices and lowers the CPU and I/O performance
efficiency of the storage system.
  We present Rio, a new approach to the storage order of remote storage access.
The key insight in Rio is that the layered design of the software stack, along
with the concurrent and asynchronous network and storage devices, makes the
storage stack conceptually similar to the CPU pipeline. Inspired by the CPU
pipeline that executes out-of-order and commits in-order, Rio introduces the
I/O pipeline that allows internal out-of-order and asynchronous execution for
ordered write requests while offering intact external storage order to
applications. Together with merging consecutive ordered requests, these design
decisions make for write throughput and CPU efficiency close to that of
orderless requests.
  We implement Rio in Linux NVMe over RDMA stack, and further build a file
system named RioFS atop Rio. Evaluations show that Rio outperforms Linux NVMe
over RDMA and a state-of-the-art storage stack named Horae by two orders of
magnitude and 4.9 times on average in terms of throughput of ordered write
requests, respectively. RioFS increases the throughput of RocksDB by 1.9 times

validate it by comparing results for the partition function, the chiral

present tensor results for the chiral condensate as a function of the mass and

restrictions on statistical behaviour of their orbits in dynamical systems on

of a $T$-invariant Borel probability measure, but we also consider much more
general sets (for example, $\alpha$-Birkhoff regular sets and the irregular set
appearing in multifractal analysis of ergodic averages of a continuous
real-valued function). We show that many of these sets are Borel. In fact, all
these sets are Borel when we assume that our space is compact. We provide
examples of these sets being non-Borel, properly placed at the first level of
the projective hierarchy (they are complete analytic or co-analytic). This
proves that the compactness assumption is in some cases necessary to obtain
Borelness. When these sets are Borel, we use the Borel hierarchy to measure
their descriptive complexity. We show that the sets of interest are located at
most at the third level of the hierarchy. We also use a modified version of the
specification property to show that for many dynamical systems these sets are
properly located at the third level. To demonstrate that the specification
property is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for maximal descriptive
complexity of a set of generic points, we provide an example of a compact

Open, 6 (2022) 100047] that a range of interfacial patterns can be formed by
controlling the elasticity of the displaced suspension, the flow rate of the
displacing fluid and the interfacial tension of the fluid pair. Interestingly,
all the different morphological features can be distinguished in terms of their
areal ratios, defined as the ratio of the areas occupied by the fully-developed
pattern and the smallest circle enclosing it. In a significant advance to this
earlier work, we show here that a systematic study of spatio-temporal pattern
growth can reveal important information about pattern selection mechanisms. We
analyse the time-evolution of the patterns to reveal interesting correlations
between their growth mechanisms and fully-developed morphologies. We believe
that such systematic identification of the unique temporal features
characterising pattern growth at the interface between an aging viscoelastic
clay suspension and a Newtonian fluid can be useful in predicting and
suppressing the onset and evolution of interfacial instabilities in the
displacement of mud and cement slurries.

However, most previous works fail to reproduce them in the two-strategy
game-theoretical models. Here we show that oscillatory behaviors naturally
emerge if incomplete information is incorporated into the cooperation evolution
of a non-Markov model. Specifically, we consider a population playing
prisoner's dilemma game, where each individual can only probabilistically get
access to their neighbors' payoff information and store them within their
memory with a given length. They make their decisions based upon these
memories. Interestingly, we find that the level of cooperation generally cannot
stabilize but render quasi-periodic oscillation, and this observation is
strengthened for a longer memory and a smaller information acquisition
probability. The mechanism uncovered shows that there are misperceived payoffs
about the player's neighborhood, facilitating the growth of cooperators and
defectors at different stages that leads to oscillatory behaviors as a result.
Our findings are robust to the underlying structure of the population. Given
the omnipresence of incomplete information, our findings may provide a
plausible explanation for the phenomenon of oscillatory behaviors in the real
world.

for forecasting time series data reaching state-of-the-art performance.
Training such models can be delicate though. The two most common training
strategies within this context are teacher forcing (TF) and free running (FR).
TF can be used to help the model to converge faster but may provoke an exposure
bias issue due to a discrepancy between training and inference phase. FR helps
to avoid this but does not necessarily lead to better results, since it tends
to make the training slow and unstable instead. Scheduled sampling was the
first approach tackling these issues by picking the best from both worlds and
combining it into a curriculum learning (CL) strategy. Although scheduled
sampling seems to be a convincing alternative to FR and TF, we found that, even
if parametrized carefully, scheduled sampling may lead to premature termination
of the training when applied for time series forecasting. To mitigate the
problems of the above approaches we formalize CL strategies along the training
as well as the training iteration scale. We propose several new curricula, and
systematically evaluate their performance in two experimental sets. For our
experiments, we utilize six datasets generated from prominent chaotic systems.
We found that the newly proposed increasing training scale curricula with a
probabilistic iteration scale curriculum consistently outperforms previous
training strategies yielding an NRMSE improvement of up to 81% over FR or TF
training. For some datasets we additionally observe a reduced number of
training iterations. We observed that all models trained with the new curricula
yield higher prediction stability allowing for longer prediction horizons.

be absent due to unpleasant experiences or low benefits. Yet most studies on

repeated interactions are compulsory. Here, we introduce a general framework of
repeated optional multiplayer games, where individuals can freely opt out of
each interaction and resume participation later. We find that optional
participation significantly enhances the cooperation rate, promoting both the
emergence and maintenance of cooperation. It acts as a catalyst for the
emergence of cooperation by helping escape from the social trap of mutual
defection and it sustains cooperation by posing more threats to intentional
defectors. Furthermore, we analytically identify two novel classes of
strategies that readily become equilibria and contribute to such promotive
effects. Our work thus highlights that voluntary participation plays a crucial

two-particle cumulants, used for the first time for heavy-flavour measurements,

fingerprint of its past formation and dynamical evolution history. Long-term
follow-up observations are key to complete their picture. In this paper we
focus on the confirmation and characterization of the components of the TOI-969
planetary system, where TESS detected a Neptune-size planet candidate in a very
close-in orbit around a late K-dwarf star. We use a set of precise radial
velocity observations from HARPS, PFS and CORALIE instruments covering more
than two years in combination with the TESS photometric light curve and other
ground-based follow-up observations to confirm and characterize the components
of this planetary system. We find that TOI-969 b is a transiting close-in
($P_b\sim 1.82$ days) mini-Neptune planet ($m_b=9.1^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$
M$_{\oplus}$, $R_b=2.765^{+0.088}_{-0.097}$ R$_{\oplus}$), thus placing it on
the {lower boundary} of the hot-Neptune desert ($T_{\rm eq,b}=941\pm31$ K). The
analysis of its internal structure shows that TOI-969 b is a volatile-rich
planet, suggesting it underwent an inward migration. The radial velocity model
also favors the presence of a second massive body in the system, TOI-969 c,
with a long period of $P_c=1700^{+290}_{-280}$ days and a minimum mass of
$m_{c}\sin{i_c}=11.3^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, and with a highly-eccentric
orbit of $e_c=0.628^{+0.043}_{-0.036}$. The TOI-969 planetary system is one of
the few around K-dwarfs known to have this extended configuration going from a
very close-in planet to a wide-separation gaseous giant. TOI-969 b has a
transmission spectroscopy metric of 93, and it orbits a moderately bright
($G=11.3$ mag) star, thus becoming an excellent target for atmospheric studies.
The architecture of this planetary system can also provide valuable information
about migration and formation of planetary systems.

phase, corroborating the role of low-E modes in Li+ diffusion. The frustrated
energy landscape and host flexibility (due to random orientation and
vibrational motion of SiO4 polyhedral units) play an essential role in
diffusing the Li+. We used AIMD simulations to identify that these low-E modes
involve a large amplitude of Li vibrations coupled with SiO4 vibrations in the
amorphous phase. At elevated temperatures, these vibrational dynamics
accelerate the Li+ diffusion via a paddle-wheel like coupling mechanism. Above
775 K, these SiO4 vibrational dynamics drive the system into the crystalline

provide valuable information about the atomic level stochastic and vibrational

The
formation of these gaps can reduce the corotation torques acting on the

dust and pebbles can be trapped at the edge of the gap. This accumulation of
dust could explain the origin of the ring-like dust structures observed using
high-resolution interferometry. In this work we provide an empirical scaling
relation for the depth of the gap cleared by a planet on an eccentric orbit as
a function of the planet-to-star mass ratio $q$, the disc aspect ratio $h$,
Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and planetary eccentricity $e$.
We construct the scaling relation using a heuristic approach: we calibrate a
toy model based on the impulse approximation with 2D hydrodynamical
simulations. The scaling reproduces the gap depth for moderate eccentricities
($e\leq 4h$) and when the surface density contrast outside and inside the gap
is $\leq 10^{2}$. Our framework can be used as the basis of more sophisticated
models aiming to predict the radial gap profile for eccentric planets.

each instance or their relations, which is the instance-level knowledge only
from the teacher model, i.e., the local knowledge. However, the empirical
studies show that the local knowledge is much noisy in object detection tasks,
especially on the blurred, occluded, or small instances. Thus, a more intrinsic
approach is to measure the representations of instances w.r.t. a group of
common basis vectors in the two feature spaces of the teacher and the student
detectors, i.e., global knowledge. Then, the distilling algorithm can be
applied as space alignment. To this end, a novel prototype generation module
(PGM) is proposed to find the common basis vectors, dubbed prototypes, in the
two feature spaces. Then, a robust distilling module (RDM) is applied to
construct the global knowledge based on the prototypes and filtrate noisy
global and local knowledge by measuring the discrepancy of the representations
in two feature spaces. Experiments with Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet on PASCAL and
COCO datasets show that our method achieves the best performance for distilling

infinity Laplace equation for length scales at the connectivity threshold. In
the graph-based semi-supervised learning community this equation is also known
as Lipschitz learning. The graph infinity Laplace equation is characterized by
the metric on the underlying space, and convergence rates follow from
convergence rates for graph distances. At the connectivity threshold, this
problem is related to Euclidean first passage percolation, which is concerned
with the Euclidean distance function $d_{h}(x,y)$ on a homogeneous Poisson
point process on $\mathbb{R}^d$, where admissible paths have step size at most
$h>0$. Using a suitable regularization of the distance function and
subadditivity we prove that ${d_{h_s}(0,se_1)}/ s \to \sigma$ as $s\to\infty$
almost surely where $\sigma \geq 1$ is a dimensional constant and $h_s\gtrsim
\log(s)^\frac{1}{d}$. A convergence rate is not available due to a lack of
approximate superadditivity when $h_s\to \infty$. Instead, we prove convergence
rates for the ratio $\frac{d_{h}(0,se_1)}{d_{h}(0,2se_1)}\to \frac{1}{2}$ when
$h$ is frozen and does not depend on $s$. Combining this with the techniques
that we developed in (Bungert, Calder, Roith, IMA Journal of Numerical

establish uniform convergence rates for solutions of the graph infinity Laplace

  Motivated by the widespread popularity of video games, we propose the first

explain how (and why) attackers can exploit the abundant public data in the
Dota2 ecosystem to infer private information about its players. Due to lack of
concrete evidence on the efficacy of our AIA, we empirically prove and assess
their impact in reality. By conducting an extensive survey on $\sim$500 Dota2
players spanning over 26k matches, we verify whether a correlation exists
between a player's Dota2 activity and their real-life. Then, after finding such
a link ($p$ < 0.01 and $\rho$ > 0.3), we ethically perform diverse AIA. We
leverage the capabilities of machine learning to infer real-life attributes of
the respondents of our survey by using their publicly available in-game data.
Our results show that, by applyingdomain expertise, some AIA can reach up to
98% precision and over 90% accuracy. This paper hence raises the alarm on a
subtle, but concrete threat that can potentially affect the entire competitive

exponentially decaying two-point temporal correlations but very different

a kinetic temperature which remains uniform in the bulk. Moreover, we find the
emergence of an `equipartition of energy' in the bulk of the system -- the bulk
kinetic temperature equals the bulk potential temperature in the thermodynamic

energy current in the bulk which always shows a logarithmic divergence near the
origin and asymmetric exponential tails. The signatures of specific active
driving become visible in the behavior of the oscillators near the boundary.
This is most prominent for the RTP and ABP driven chains where the boundary

local invariant features computed at interest point locations has become a
standard choice for many computer vision tasks. Visual vocabularies generated
from image feature vectors are expected to produce visual words that are
discriminative to improve the performance of image annotation systems. Most
techniques that adopt the BOW model in annotating images declined favorable
information that can be mined from image categories to build discriminative
visual vocabularies. To this end, this paper introduces a detailed framework
for automatically annotating natural scene images with local semantic labels
from a predefined vocabulary. The framework is based on a hypothesis that
assumes that, in natural scenes, intermediate semantic concepts are correlated
with the local keypoints. Based on this hypothesis, image regions can be
efficiently represented by BOW model and using a machine learning approach,
such as SVM, to label image regions with semantic annotations. Another
objective of this paper is to address the implications of generating visual
vocabularies from image halves, instead of producing them from the whole image,
on the performance of annotating image regions with semantic labels. All
BOW-based approaches as well as baseline methods have been extensively
evaluated on 6-categories dataset of natural scenes using the SVM and KNN
classifiers. The reported results have shown the plausibility of using the BOW
model to represent the semantic information of image regions and thus to
automatically annotate image regions with labels.

the presence of financial frictions, however, the optimal level of abatement
cannot be defined without taking a stand on how abatement costs are distributed
among individuals. I propose a simple linear cost-sharing scheme that has
several desirable normative properties. I use calibrated examples of economies

single RGB image. For both, the convolutional as well as the recent
attention-based models, encoder-decoder-based architectures have been found to
be useful due to the simultaneous requirement of global context and pixel-level
resolution. Typically, a skip connection module is used to fuse the encoder and
decoder features, which comprises of feature map concatenation followed by a
convolution operation. Inspired by the demonstrated benefits of attention in a
multitude of computer vision problems, we propose an attention-based fusion of
encoder and decoder features. We pose MDE as a pixel query refinement problem,
where coarsest-level encoder features are used to initialize pixel-level
queries, which are then refined to higher resolutions by the proposed Skip
Attention Module (SAM). We formulate the prediction problem as ordinal
regression over the bin centers that discretize the continuous depth range and
introduce a Bin Center Predictor (BCP) module that predicts bins at the
coarsest level using pixel queries. Apart from the benefit of image adaptive
depth binning, the proposed design helps learn improved depth embedding in
initial pixel queries via direct supervision from the ground truth. Extensive
experiments on the two canonical datasets, NYUV2 and KITTI, show that our

Long-term. The solar dynamo mechanism is believed to be responsible for these
global changes happening in the Sun. Hence, many dynamo models have been
proposed to explain the observed behaviour of the Sun. This thesis is primarily
focused on studying the \lt\ variation of the Sun and provides various inputs
to the solar dynamo models. With a renewed interest in the subject, several
automatic techniques have been developed for extensive data analysis as applied
to long-term datasets and presented in this thesis. This approach provides
better consistency and eliminates human subjectivity, which has been a normal
practice in the past. The variation of penumbra to umbra area ratio, q,
observed here, will provide constraints in sunspot simulations. In addition,
the absence of any difference in the behaviour of small and big spots does not
support the idea of the global and local dynamo. Two classes of BMRs observed
in the magnetograms further verify this behaviour. The importance of the NSSL
is not studied so well in the context of solar dynamo models, but it will be
worth waiting to see its significance for understanding solar dynamo. Finally,
the indication of tilt quenching presented here needs to be further verified

studying the spontaneous decay of one or many emitters coupled to the system's

by these modes at the hinges of the system. Thanks to this mechanism a

states behave as a dissipative chiral quantum channel enabling, e.g., perfect
quantum state transfer. In the presence of revivals, an effective off-resonant

expected that a phase transition from baryonic to deconfined quark matter may
occur. Such a phase transition would affect the underlying equation of state
(EoS) as well as the observable astrophysical properties of neutron stars.
Comparison of EoS model predictions with astronomical data from multi-messenger
signals then provides us an opportunity to probe the behaviour of dense matter.
In this work, we restrict the allowed parameter space of EoS models in neutron
stars for both nucleonic (relativistic mean field model) and quark matter (bag
model) sectors by imposing state-of-the-art constraints from nuclear
calculations, multi-messenger astrophysical data and perturbative QCD (pQCD).
We systematically investigate the effect of each constraint on the parameter
space of uncertainties using a cut-off filter scheme, as well as the
correlations among the parameters and with neutron star astrophysical
observables. Using the constraints, we obtain limits for maximum NS mass,
maximum central density, as well as for NS radii and tidal deformability.
Although pQCD constraints are only effective at very high densities, they
significantly reduce the parameter space of the quark model. We also conclude
that astrophysical data supports high values of the bag parameter B and
disfavors the existence of a pure quark matter core in hybrid stars.

perception (neural) and reasoning (ILP). A recent SOTA approach for end-to-end
training of Neural ILP explicitly defines gradients through the ILP black box
(Paulus et al. 2021) - this trains extremely slowly, owing to a call to the
underlying ILP solver for every training data point in a minibatch. In
response, we present an alternative training strategy that is solver-free,
i.e., does not call the ILP solver at all at training time. Neural ILP has a
set of trainable hyperplanes (for cost and constraints in ILP), together
representing a polyhedron. Our key idea is that the training loss should impose
that the final polyhedron separates the positives (all constraints satisfied)
from the negatives (at least one violated constraint or a suboptimal cost
value), via a soft-margin formulation. While positive example(s) are provided

universal features. First, their mass $m$ obeys the so-called
Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner (GMOR) relation $f^2\,m^2=H\,\bar{\sigma}$, with $f$ the
Goldstone stiffness, $H$ the explicit breaking scale and $\bar{\sigma}$ the
spontaneous condensate. More recently, it has been shown that their damping
$\Omega$ is constrained to follow the relation $\Omega=m^2 D_\varphi$, where
$D_\varphi$ is the Goldstone diffusivity in the purely spontaneous phase. Pions
are the most paradigmatic example of pseudo-Goldstone modes and they are
related to chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. In this work, we consider a
bottom-up soft-wall AdS-QCD model with broken ${\rm{SU}}(2)_L \times
{\rm{SU}}(2)_R$ symmetry and we study the nature of the associated
pseudo-Goldstone modes -- the pions. In particular, we perform a detailed
investigation of their dispersion relation in presence of dissipation, of the
role of the explicit breaking induced by the quark masses and of the dynamics
near the critical point. Taking advantage of the microscopic information
provided by the holographic model, we give quantitative predictions for all the
coefficients appearing in the effective description. In particular, we estimate
the finite temperature behavior of the kinetic parameter $\mathfrak{r^2}$
defined as the ration between the Goldstone diffusivity $D_\varphi$ and the
pion attenuation constant $D_A$. Interestingly, we observe important deviations
from the value $\mathfrak{r^2}=3/4$ computed in chiral perturbation theory in
the limit of zero temperature.

this work, we propose a novel idea of interpreting the lighting in the single-

introduce an enhanced auto white-balance (AWB) method that models the lighting
in single- and mixed-illuminant scenes as the style factor. Our AWB method does
not require any illumination estimation step, yet contains a network learning
to generate the weighting maps of the images with different WB settings.
Proposed network utilizes the style information, extracted from the scene by a
multi-head style extraction module. AWB correction is completed after blending
these weighting maps and the scene. Experiments on single- and mixed-illuminant
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves promising correction
results when compared to the recent works. This shows that the lighting in the
scenes with multiple illuminations can be modeled by the concept of style.

  problem -- Coherence of the model","89 pages, 12 figures, 23 tables",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Recently, V. Laure van Bambeke used an original approach to solve the famous
problem of transformation of values into production prices by considering that
capital reallocation to each department (branch) was part of the problem. Here,
we confirm the validity of this consideration in relation with the satisfaction
of demand (social need which is able to pay for the given product). In contrast
to V. Laure van Bambeke's method of solving an overdetermined system of
equations (implying that compliance with Marx's fundamental equalities could
only be approached), we show that the transformation problem is solvable from a
determined (two-branch models) or an underdetermined system of equations
enabling to obtain exact solutions through an algorithm we provide, with no
approximation needed. For systems with three branches or more, the solution of
the transformation problem belongs to an infinite ensemble, accounting for the
observed high competition-driven market fluidity. Furthermore, we show that the
transformation problem is solvable in the absence of fixed capital, supporting
that dealing with the latter is not essential and cannot be seen as a potential
flaw of the approach. Our algorithm enables simulations illustrating how the
transient rise in the rate of profit predicted by the Okishio theorem is
consistent with the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF) subsequent to
capital reallocation, and how the TRPF is governed by the increase of organic
composition, in value. We establish that the long-standing transformation
problem is not such a problem since it is easily solved through our algorithm,
whatever the number of branches considered. This emphasizes the high coherence
of Marx's conception, and its impressive relevance regarding issues such as the
TRPF, which have remained intensely debated.

natural images, which results in data augmentation technologies often being
used in medical image segmentation tasks. Most data augmentation technologies
used in medical segmentation were originally developed on natural images and do
not take into account the characteristic that the overall layout of medical
images is standard and fixed. Methods: Based on the characteristics of medical
images, we developed the cutting-splicing data augmentation (CS-DA) method, a
novel data augmentation technology for medical image segmentation. CS-DA
augments the dataset by splicing different position components cut from
different original medical images into a new image. The characteristics of the
medical image result in the new image having the same layout as and similar
appearance to the original image. Compared with classical data augmentation
technologies, CS-DA is simpler and more robust. Moreover, CS-DA does not
introduce any noise or fake information into the newly created image. Results:
To explore the properties of CS-DA, many experiments are conducted on eight
diverse datasets. On the training dataset with the small sample size, CS-DA can
effectively increase the performance of the segmentation model. When CS-DA is
used together with classical data augmentation technologies, the performance of
the segmentation model can be further improved and is much better than that of
CS-DA and classical data augmentation separately. We also explored the
influence of the number of components, the position of the cutting line, and
the splicing method on the CS-DA performance. Conclusions: The excellent
performance of CS-DA in the experiment has confirmed the effectiveness of
CS-DA, and provides a new data augmentation idea for the small sample
segmentation task.

photometric light curves for stars across nearly the entire sky. This allows

above the TESS 30-minute cadence Nyquist frequency with the purpose of
encompassing the main sequence and subgiant evolutionary phases. We aim to
provide estimates for the global asteroseismic parameters $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$
and $\Delta\nu$. We apply a new probabilistic detection algorithm to the
120-second and 20-second light curves of over 250,000 stars. This algorithm
flags targets that show characteristic signatures of solar-like oscillations.
We manually vet the resulting list of targets to confirm the presence of
solar-like oscillations. Using the probability densities computed by the
algorithm, we measure the global asteroseismic parameters $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$
and $\Delta\nu$. We produce a catalogue of 4,177 solar-like oscillators,
reporting $\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ for $98\%$ of the total star
count. The asteroseismic data reveals vast coverage of the HR diagram,
populating the red giant branch, the subgiant regime and extending toward the
main sequence. A crossmatch with external catalogs shows that 25 of the
detected solar-like oscillators are a component of a spectroscopic binary, and
28 are confirmed planet host stars. These results provide the potential for
precise, independent asteroseismic constraints on these and any additional TESS
targets of interest.

However, the development of efficient and environmentally friendly deicing

deicing through nanoscale surface activation enabled by surface acoustic waves
(SAWs), allowing efficient on-demand deicing of surface areas spanning several
square centimeters covered with thick layers of glace ice. We contemplate
SAW-based deicing from a twofold perspective: First, we demonstrate its
functionality both with a bulk piezoelectric material (LiNbO3) and a
piezo-electric film (ZnO), the latter proving its versatile applicability to a
large variety of functional materials with practical importance; second, we
gain fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for efficient deicing
using SAWs. In particular, we show that SAW vibrational modes easily transport
energy over greater distances outside the electrode areas and efficiently melt
large ice aggregates covering the materials' surfaces. In addition, the
essential physics of SAW-based deicing is inferred from a carefully designed
experimental and numerical study. We support our findings by providing
macroscopic camera snapshots captured in situ inside a climate chamber during
deicing and highly resolved laser-doppler vibrometer scans of the undisturbed
wavefields at room temperature. Great care was taken to deposit the
interdigital transducers (IDTs) used for SAW excitation only on ice-free areas
close to the chip edges, leaving most of the substrate used for deicing
unaltered and, as a matter of fact, demonstrating transparent deicing

""antenna-like"" property of a planar dielectric surface in axion
electrodynamics, elaborating on the treatment given earlier on this topic by
Millar {\it et al.} (2017). We calculate the electromagnetic energy
transmission coefficient for a dielectric plate, and compare with the
conventional expression in ordinary electrodynamics. 2. We consider the
situation where the medium exterior to the plate, assumed elastic, is ""bent
back"" and glued together, so that we obtain a circular dielectric string in
which the waves can propagate clockwise or counterclockwise. As will be shown,
a stationary wave pattern is permitted by the formalism, and we show how the
amplitudes for the two counterpropagating waves can be found. 3. As a special
case, by omitting axions for a moment, we analyze the Casimir effect for the
string, showing its similarity as well as its difference with the Casimir
effect of a scalar field for a piecewise uniform string (Brevik and Nielsen
1990). 4. Finally, including axions again we analyze the enhancement of the
surface-generated electromagnetic radiation near the center of a cylindrical
haloscope, where the interior region is a vacuum and the exterior region a
metal. This enhancement is caused by the curvature of the boundary, and is
mathematically a consequence of the behavior of the Hankel function of the
second kind for small arguments. A simple estimate shows that enhancement may
be quite significant, and can therefore be of experimental interest. This
proposal is suggested as an alternative to the reflector arrangement in a
similar arrangement recently discussed by Liu {\it et al.} (2022).

  Region Detection in Image Regression",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper aims to present the first Frequentist framework on signal region
detection in high-resolution and high-order image regression problems. Image
data and scalar-on-image regression are intensively studied in recent years.
However, most existing studies on such topics focused on outcome prediction,
while the research on image region detection is rather limited, even though the
latter is often more important. In this paper, we develop a general framework
named Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition (SKPD) to tackle this issue. The
SKPD framework is general in the sense that it works for both matrices (e.g.,
2D grayscale images) and (high-order) tensors (e.g., 2D colored images, brain
MRI/fMRI data) represented image data. Moreover, unlike many Bayesian
approaches, our framework is computationally scalable for high-resolution image
problems. Specifically, our framework includes: 1) the one-term SKPD; 2) the
multi-term SKPD; and 3) the nonlinear SKPD. We propose nonconvex optimization
problems to estimate the one-term and multi-term SKPDs and develop
path-following algorithms for the nonconvex optimization. The computed
solutions of the path-following algorithm are guaranteed to converge to the
truth with a particularly chosen initialization even though the optimization is
nonconvex. Moreover, the region detection consistency could also be guaranteed
by the one-term and multi-term SKPD. The nonlinear SKPD is highly connected to
shallow convolutional neural networks (CNN), particular to CNN with one
convolutional layer and one fully connected layer. Effectiveness of SKPDs is
validated by real brain imaging data in the UK Biobank database.

of this paper is to compare the basic geometrical (size, orientation) and

of energy dissipation in a non-potential coronal magnetic field simulation. In
the simulation, HMI line-of-sight magnetograms are used as input to drive the
evolution of solar coronal magnetic fields and energy dissipation. We applied
an automatic EUV brightening detection method to EUV images obtained on 30 May
2020 by the HRI_EUV telescope. We applied the same detection method to the
simulated energy dissipation maps from the non-potential simulation to detect
simulated brightenings. We detected EUV brightenings with density of
1.41x10^{-3} brightenings/Mm^2 in the EUI observations and simulated
brightenings between 2.76x10^{-2} - 4.14x10^{-2} brightenings/Mm^2 in the

were produced in the simulations, the results show similar distributions of the
key geometrical and physical properties of the observed and simulated

reproduce statistically the characteristic properties of the EUV brightenings
(typically with more than 85% similarity); only the duration of the events is
significantly different between observations and simulation. Further
investigations based on high-cadence and high-resolution magnetograms from

recent years by encompassing a set of technologies that enable a variety of

through efficient networking protocols. These technologies have already been
used in several domains such as in manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, etc.
Another domain in which IoT can be applicable and useful, is that of supply
chain tracing, where products are monitored throughout the whole supply chain.
IoT data collection can enable the proliferation of applications, which are
able to track environmental-related information per product (e.g. storage
conditions), and combine them together with traceability data in order to
provide full product monitoring services.
  Traditional supply chain tracing methods (e.g. product tracing, storage
conditions' monitoring, transport vehicles used, etc.) involve costly and
error-prone procedures, as human involvement is often required. Severe
fragmentation is also possible, as the various stakeholders involved
(producers, distributors, retailers), do not use interoperable technologies and
standards.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a flexible and secure prototype
platform that leverages IoT technologies, jointly with the Electronic Product
Code Information Service (EPCIS) standard. The IoT software/hardware modules of
the platform are used to collect IoT data (i.e. geographical location, ambient

PBNN achieves good predictive performance for a given mini-batch size. Varying
the size of the mini-batches enables a natural calibration of the predictive

the Frobenius theorem on log-Lipschitz vector fields: if $X_1,\dots,X_m$ are
log-Lipschitz vector fields such that $[X_i,X_j]=\sum_{k=1}^mc_{ij}^kX_k$ where
$c_{ij}^k$ are the derivatives of log-Lipschitz functions, then for any point
$p$ there is a $C^1$-manifold containing $p$ such that $X_1,\dots,X_m$ span its

$1<\alpha<2$ then on each leaf where $X_1,\dots,X_m$ span the tangent spaces we

$\Phi^*X_1,\dots,\Phi^*X_m$ are $C^\alpha$, and their $C^\alpha$ norm depend
only on the diffeomorphic invariant quantities of $X_1,\dots,X_m$.
  For a complex Frobenius structure there is a coordinate chart $F$ that takes
image in $\mathbb R^r_t\times\mathbb C^m_z\times \mathbb R^{N-r-2m}_s$, such
that the structure is locally spanned by $F^*\partial_t,F^*\partial_z$. When it

be taken to be $\mathscr C^\alpha$, and the vector fields
$F^*\partial_t,F^*\partial_z$ are $\mathscr C^{\alpha-\epsilon}$ for every

$F^*\partial_z$ is optimal. When a complex Frobenius structure $S$ is
$C^\alpha$ ($\frac12<\alpha\le1$) such that $S+\bar S$ is log-Lipschitz, then
for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a $C^{2\alpha-1-\epsilon}$ homeomorphism

based on PyTorch, designed specifically to speed up neural networks whenever
data is continuously streamed over time, for both learning and inference.
  Existing libraries are designed to exploit data-level parallelism, assuming
that samples are batched, a condition that is not naturally met in applications
that are based on streamed data. Differently, PARTIME starts processing each
data sample at the time in which it becomes available from the stream. PARTIME
wraps the code that implements a feed-forward multi-layer network and it
distributes the layer-wise processing among multiple devices, such as Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs). Thanks to its pipeline-based computational scheme,
PARTIME allows the devices to perform computations in parallel. At inference
time this results in scaling capabilities that are theoretically linear with
respect to the number of devices. During the learning stage, PARTIME can
leverage the non-i.i.d. nature of the streamed data with samples that are
smoothly evolving over time for efficient gradient computations. Experiments
are performed in order to empirically compare PARTIME with classic non-parallel
neural computations in online learning, distributing operations on up to 8
NVIDIA GPUs, showing significant speedups that are almost linear in the number
of devices, mitigating the impact of the data transfer overhead.

few years with the latest improvements in computer vision and graphics.
Geometry and topology are two fundamental concepts when dealing with 3D mesh
structures. But the latest often remains a side issue in the 3D mesh-based
reconstruction literature. Indeed, performing per-vertex elementary
displacements over a 3D sphere mesh only impacts its geometry and leaves the
topological structure unchanged and fixed. Whereas few attempts propose to
update the geometry and the topology, all need to lean on costly 3D
ground-truth to determine the faces/edges to prune. We present in this work a
method that aims to refine the topology of any 3D mesh through a face-pruning
strategy that extensively relies upon 2D alpha masks and camera pose
information. Our solution leverages a differentiable renderer that renders each
face as a 2D soft map. Its pixel intensity reflects the probability of being
covered during the rendering process by such a face. Based on the 2D soft-masks
available, our method is thus able to quickly highlight all the incorrectly
rendered faces for a given viewpoint. Because our module is agnostic to the
network that produces the 3D mesh, it can be easily plugged into any
self-supervised image-based (either synthetic or natural) 3D reconstruction
pipeline to get complex meshes with a non-spherical topology.

instead of just one; to date, an increasing number of such planets have been
discovered with a variety of techniques. If the orbital frequency of the
hosting stellar pair is much higher than the planetary one, the tight stellar
binary can be considered as a matter ring current generating its own
post-Newtonian stationary gravitomagnetic field through its orbital angular
momentum. It affects the orbital motion of a relatively distant planet with
Lense-Thirring-type precessional effects which, under certain circumstances,
may amount to a significant fraction of the static, gravitoelectric ones,
analogous to the well known Einstein perihelion precession of Mercury,
depending only on the masses of the system's bodies. Instead, when the
gravitomagnetic field is due solely to the spin of each of the central star(s),
the Lense-Thirring shifts are several orders of magnitude smaller than the
gravitoelectric ones. In view of the growing interest in the scientific
community about the detection of general relativistic effects in exoplanets,
the perspectives of finding new scenarios for testing such a further
manifestation of general relativity might be deemed worth of further

study how Lyman Continuum (LyC) photons escape from galaxies and the
observational signatures of this escape. We define two classes of LyC leaker:
Bursty Leakers and Remnant Leakers, based on their star formation rates (SFRs)
that are averaged over 10 Myr (SFR$_{10}$) or 100 Myr (SFR$_{100}$). Both have
$f_{\rm esc}>20\%$ and experienced an extreme burst of star formation, but
Bursty Leakers have ${\rm SFR_{10}>SFR_{100}}$, while Remnant Leakers have
${\rm SFR_{10}<SFR_{100}}$. The maximum SFRs in these bursts were typically
$\sim100$ times greater than the SFR of the galaxy prior to the burst, a rare
$2\sigma$ outlier among the general high-redshift galaxy population. Bursty
Leakers are qualitatively similar to ionization-bounded nebulae with holes,
exhibiting high ionization parameters and typical HII region gas densities.
Remnant Leakers show properties of density-bounded nebulae, having normal
ionization parameters but much lower HII region densities. Both types of leaker
exhibit [CII]$_{\rm 158\mu m}$ deficits on the [CII]-SFR$_{100}$ relation,
while only Bursty Leakers show deficits when SFR$_{10}$ is used. We predict
that [CII] luminosity and SFR indicators such as H$\alpha$ and M$_{\rm
1500\r{A}}$ can be combined to identify both types of LyC leaker and the mode
by which photons are escaping. These predictions can be tested with [CII]
observations of known $z=3-4$ LyC leakers. Finally, we show that leakers with
$f_{\rm esc}>20\%$ dominate the ionizing photon budget at $z\gtrsim7.5$ but the
contribution from galaxies with $f_{\rm esc}<5\%$ becomes significant at the
tail-end of reionization.

holistic approach that provides such a bigger picture and use it to understand
how the terrestrial biosphere can be sustained in the presence of increased
human activities. This approach focuses on the free energy generated by
photosynthesis, energy needed to sustain either the dissipative metabolic
activity of ecosystems or human activities, with the generation rate being set
by the physical constraints of the environment. We can then distinguish two
kinds of human impacts on the biosphere: detrimental effects caused by enhanced
human consumption of this free energy, and empowering effects that allow for
more photosynthetic activity and therefore more dissipative activity of the
biosphere. I use examples from the terrestrial biosphere to illustrate this
view as well as global datasets to show how this can be estimated. I then
discuss how certain aspects of human-made technology can act to enhance the
free energy generation of the terrestrial biosphere, which can then facilitate
sustaining the biosphere in times at which human activity increasingly shapes

our planet, in particular, its radiogenic power, insights formation and
chemical composition. To date, only the KamLAND and Borexino experiments
observed geoneutrino, with the former characterized by low concentration of
heat-producing elements in the Earth in contrast to the latter that sets tight
upper limits on the power of a georeactor hypothesized. With respect to the
results yielded therefrom, a small discrepancy has been identified. On this
account, next generation experiments like JUNO are needed if it is to provide
definitive results with respect to the Earth's radiogenic power, and to fully
exploit geoneutrinos to better understand deep Earth.
  An accurate a priori prediction of the crustal contribution plays an
important role in enabling the translation of a particle physics measurement
into geo-scientific questions. The existing GIGJ model of JUNO only focused on
constructing a geophysical model of the local crust, without local geochemical
data. Another existing JULOC includes both data, but only able to be achieved
for the top layer of the upper crust, not in deep vertical. This paper reports
on the development of JUNO's first 3-D integrated model, JULOC-I, which
combines seismic, gravity, rock sample and thermal flow data with new building
method, solved the problem in vertical depth.
  JULOC-I results show higher than expected geoneutrino signals are mainly
attributable to higher U and Th in southern China than that found elsewhere on
Earth. Moreover, the high level of accuracy of the JULOC-I model, complemented
by 10 years of experimental data, indicates that JUNO has an opportunity to

quasi-regularities in languages like humans. In a typical quasi-regularity
task, English past tense inflections, the neural network model has long been
criticized that it learns only to generalize the most frequent pattern, but not
the regular pattern, thus can not learn the abstract categories of regular and
irregular and is dissimilar to human performance. In this work, we train a set
of transformer models with different settings to examine their behavior on this
task. The models achieved high accuracy on unseen regular verbs and some
accuracy on unseen irregular verbs. The models' performance on the regulars is
heavily affected by type frequency and ratio but not token frequency and ratio,
and vice versa for the irregulars. The different behaviors on the regulars and
irregulars suggest that the models have some degree of symbolic learning on the
regularity of the verbs. In addition, the models are weakly correlated with
human behavior on nonce verbs. Although the transformer model exhibits some
level of learning on the abstract category of verb regularity, its performance
does not fit human data well, suggesting that it might not be a good cognitive

small-scale variations, a computational complexity that is independent of the
number of measurements $N$ and the size of the field is crucial. In this
setting, GP approximations using $m$ basis functions requires
$\mathcal{O}(Nm^2+m^3)$ computations. Using finite-support basis functions
reduces the required number of computations to perform a single prediction to
$\mathcal{O}(m^3)$, after a one-time training cost of $O(N)$. The prediction
cost increases with increasing field size, as the number of required basis
functions $m$ grows with the size of the field relative to the size of the
spatial variations. To prevent the prediction speed from depending on field
size, we propose leveraging the property that a subset of the trained system is
a trained subset of the system to use only a local subset of $m'\ll m$
finite-support basis functions centered around each prediction point to perform
predictions. Our proposed approximation requires $\mathcal{O}(m'^3)$ operations
to perform each prediction after a one-time training cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$.
We show on real-life spatial data that our approach matches the prediction
error of state-of-the-art methods and that it performs faster predictions, also
compared to state-of-the-art approximations that lower the prediction cost of
$\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m\log(m))$ using a conjugate gradient
solver. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can perform fast predictions
on a global bathymetry dataset using millions of basis functions and tens of
millions of measurements on a laptop computer.

dark and luminous mass distribution both within and between galaxies. Given the
presence of substructures, current strong lensing observations demand more
complex mass models than smooth analytical profiles, such as power-law
ellipsoids. In this work, we introduce a continuous neural field to predict the
lensing potential at any position throughout the image plane, allowing for a
nearly model-independent description of the lensing mass. We apply our method
on simulated Hubble Space Telescope imaging data containing different types of
perturbations to a smooth mass distribution: a localized dark subhalo, a
population of subhalos, and an external shear perturbation. Assuming knowledge
of the source surface brightness, we use the continuous neural field to model
either the perturbations alone or the full lensing potential. In both cases,
the resulting model is able to fit the imaging data, and we are able to
accurately recover the properties of both the smooth potential and of the
perturbations. Unlike many other deep learning methods, ours explicitly retains
lensing physics (i.e., the lens equation) and introduces high flexibility in
the model only where required, namely, in the lens potential. Moreover, the
neural network does not require pre-training on large sets of labelled data and
predicts the potential from the single observed lensing image. Our model is
implemented in the fully differentiable lens modeling code Herculens.

competing dynamics on a two-dimensional additive small-world network (A-SWN).
The system model consists of a $L\times L$ square lattice where each site of
the lattice is occupied by a spin variable that interacts with the nearest
neighbor spins and it has a certain probability $p$ of being additionally
connected at random to one of its farther neighbors. The dynamics present in
the system can be defined by the probability $q$ of being in contact with a
heat bath at a given temperature $T$ and, at the same time, with a probability
of $1-q$ the system is subjected to an external flux of energy into the system.
The contact with the heat bath is simulated by one-spin flip according to the
Metropolis prescription, while the input of energy is mimicked by the two-spin
flip process, involving a simultaneous flipping of a pair of neighboring spins.
We have employed Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the thermodynamic quantities
of the system, such as, the total $\textrm{m}_{\textrm{L}}^{\textrm{F}}$ and
staggered $\textrm{m}_{\textrm{L}}^{\textrm{AF}}$ magnetizations per spin, the
susceptibility $\chi_{\textrm{L}}$, and the reduced fourth-order Binder
cumulant $\textrm{U}_{\textrm{L}}$. We have built the phase diagram for the
stationary states of the model in the plane $T$ versus $q$, showing the
existence of two continuous transition lines for each value of $p$: one line
between the ferromagnetic $F$ and paramagnetic $P$ phases, and the other line
between the $P$ and antiferromagnetic $AF$ phases. Therefore, we have shown
that the phase diagram topology changes when $p$ increases. Using the
finite-size scaling analysis, we also obtained the critical exponents for the
system, where varying the parameter $p$, we have observed a different
universality class from the Ising model in the regular square lattice to the
A-SWN.

cross-task generalization has attracted much attention in NLP communities.
Recently, instruction tuning (IT), which fine-tunes a pre-trained language
model on a massive collection of tasks described via human-craft instructions,
has been shown effective in instruction learning for unseen tasks. However, IT
relies on a large amount of human-annotated samples, which restricts its
generalization. Unlike labeled data, unlabeled data are often massive and cheap
to obtain. In this work, we study how IT can be improved with unlabeled data.
We first empirically explore the IT performance trends versus the number of
labeled data, instructions, and training tasks. We find it critical to enlarge
the number of training instructions, and the instructions can be underutilized
due to the scarcity of labeled data. Then, we propose Unlabeled Data Augmented
Instruction Tuning (UDIT) to take better advantage of the instructions during
IT by constructing pseudo-labeled data from unlabeled plain texts. We conduct
extensive experiments to show UDIT's effectiveness in various scenarios of
tasks and datasets. We also comprehensively analyze the key factors of UDIT to
investigate how to better improve IT with unlabeled data. The code is publicly

atmospheric parameters, revealing that surface albedo and vegetation have by
far the largest impact on zenithal NSB. Additionally, the NSB is sensitive to
black carbon and organic matter aerosols at urban and rural sites respectively.
Snow depth was found to be important for some sites, while the total column of
ozone leaves impact on some rural places. The average increase in light

believed to have made the earliest contribution to the metal content of the
universe beyond the products of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. These stars are
theorized to have had extremely short lifespans, and therefore would only be
observable at high redshifts ($z \geq 3-17$) and faint apparent magnitudes
($m_{AB} \gtrsim 40$). The direct detection of Population III stars therefore
remains elusive. However, the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) may be capable of detecting stars in the relevant magnitude range in the
event of favorable gravitational lensing. Theoretical models are required to
interpret these future observations. In this study, new evolutionary models and
non-equilibrium model atmospheres were used to characterize the observable
properties of zero-age main sequence Population III stars. The calculated
models cover a wide range of possible Population III stellar masses, from the
minimum mass predicted by star formation studies to the maximum mass capable of
maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. Synthetic photometry and theoretical
color-magnitude diagrams were calculated for the bands of the Near-Infrared
Camera (NIRCam) on JWST. The final results are compared to the scales of known
lensing events and JWST magnitude limits. The purpose of this study is to
calculate the observable parameters of Population III stars in the most optimal
JWST bands in order to provide a theoretical foundation for anticipated future
observations of this stellar population.

clusters of nodes to summarize its large-scale structure, has spawned the
development of many competing algorithms with varying objectives. Some
community detection methods are inferential, explicitly deriving the clustering
objective through a probabilistic generative model, while other methods are
descriptive, dividing a network according to an objective motivated by a
particular application, making it challenging to compare these methods on the
same scale. Here we present a solution to this problem that associates any
community detection objective, inferential or descriptive, with its
corresponding implicit network generative model. This allows us to compute the
description length of a network and its partition under arbitrary objectives,
providing a principled measure to compare the performance of different
algorithms without the need for ""ground truth"" labels. Our approach also gives
access to instances of the community detection problem that are optimal to any
given algorithm, and in this way reveals intrinsic biases in popular
descriptive methods, explaining their tendency to overfit. Using our framework,
we compare a number of community detection methods on artificial networks, and
on a corpus of over 500 structurally diverse empirical networks. We find that
more expressive community detection methods exhibit consistently superior
compression performance on structured data instances, without having degraded
performance on a minority of situations where more specialized algorithms
perform optimally. Our results undermine the implications of the ""no free
lunch"" theorem for community detection, both conceptually and in practice,
since it is confined to unstructured data instances, unlike relevant community
detection problems which are structured by requirement.

powerful tool for detection of nonlinear behavior (DNB) in production quality

caused by the bilateral or unilateral saturation hard limits based on HOS
analysis. First, the traditional describing function is extended to obtain more
frequency domain information, and hereby the harmonic characteristics of
bilateral and the unilateral saturation hard limit are studied. Then the
bispectrum and trispectrum are introduced as HOS, which are extended into
bicoherence and tricoherence spectrums to eliminate the effects from linear

- layered-graph structures and (partially) time-expanded networks - to
formulate our problem on a graph that allows us to implicitly encode problem
specific constraints related to intermodality. This enables us to solve a
standard integer minimum-cost multi-commodity flow problem to obtain the system
optimum for an intermodal transportation system. To solve this integer
minimum-cost multi-commodity flow problem efficiently, we present a column
generation approach to find continuous minimum-cost multi-commodity flow
solutions, which we combine with a price-and-branch procedure to obtain integer
solutions. To speed up our column generation, we further develop a pricing
filter and an admissible distance approximation to utilize the $A^*$ algorithm
for solving the pricing problems. We show the efficiency of our framework by
applying it to a real-world case study for the city of Munich, where we solve

computation time of our algorithm can be reduced by up to 60\% through the use
of our pricing filter and by up to additional 90\% through the use of the

$D\bar D (B\bar B)$ mesons in magnetized (nuclear) matter using a field
theoretic model of composite hadrons with quark (and antiquark) constituents.
These are computed from the mass modifications of the decaying and produced
mesons, including the nucleon Dirac sea effects within a chiral effective
model. The Dirac sea contributions are observed to lead to an rise (drop) in
the quark condensates as the magnetic field is increased, an effect called the
(inverse) magnetic catalysis. In the presence of a magnetic field, there are
mixings of spin 0 (pseudoscalar) and spin 1 (vector) states (PV mixing) The
nucleon Dirac sea effects are observed to be significant and the anomalous
magnetic moments (AMMs) of the nucleons are observed to play an important role.
For $\rho_B$=0, there is observed to be magnetic catalysis (MC) without and
with AMMs, whereas, for $\rho_B=\rho_0$, the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC)
is observed when the AMMs are taken into account, contrary to MC, when the AMMs
are ignored. The magnetic field effects on the heavy quarkonium decay widths
should have observable consequences on the production of the hidden and open

large.

backdoor attacks. Under such attacks, an adversary embeds a stealthy backdoor
into the trained model such that the compromised models will behave normally on
clean inputs but will misclassify according to the adversary's control on
maliciously constructed input with a trigger. While these existing attacks are
very effective, the adversary's capability is limited: given an input, these
attacks can only cause the model to misclassify toward a single pre-defined or
target class. In contrast, this paper exploits a novel backdoor attack with a
much more powerful payload, denoted as Marksman, where the adversary can
arbitrarily choose which target class the model will misclassify given any
input during inference. To achieve this goal, we propose to represent the
trigger function as a class-conditional generative model and to inject the
backdoor in a constrained optimization framework, where the trigger function
learns to generate an optimal trigger pattern to attack any target class at
will while simultaneously embedding this generative backdoor into the trained
model. Given the learned trigger-generation function, during inference, the
adversary can specify an arbitrary backdoor attack target class, and an
appropriate trigger causing the model to classify toward this target class is
created accordingly. We show empirically that the proposed framework achieves
high attack performance while preserving the clean-data performance in several
benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet. The
proposed Marksman backdoor attack can also easily bypass existing backdoor
defenses that were originally designed against backdoor attacks with a single
target class. Our work takes another significant step toward understanding the
extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice.

acids) can disturb its function, leading to illness. Whether or not a PTM is
pathogenic depends on its type and the status of neighboring residues. In this
paper, we present the ProtoFold Neighborhood Inspector (PFNI), a visualization
system for analyzing residues neighborhoods. The main contribution is a
visualization idiom, the Residue Constellation (RC), for identifying and
comparing three-dimensional neighborhoods based on per-residue features and
spatial characteristics. The RC leverages two-dimensional representations of
the protein's three-dimensional structure to overcome problems like occlusion,
easing the analysis of neighborhoods that often have complicated spatial
arrangements. Using the PFNI, we explored proteins' structural PTM data, which
allowed us to identify patterns in the distribution and quantity of
per-neighborhood PTMs that might be related to their pathogenic status. In the
following, we define the tasks that guided the development of the PFNI and
describe the data sources we derived and used. Then, we introduce the PFNI and
illustrate its usage through an example of an analysis workflow. We conclude by
reflecting on preliminary findings obtained while using the tool on the
provided data and future directions concerning the development of the PFNI.

clusters of scatterers. It is shown that when the scatterers are placed
regularly in the perimeter of a circumference the quality factor of the
resonances strongly increases with the number of scatterers in the cluster. It
is also found that in the continuous limit, that is to say, when the number of
scatterers tends to infinite, the quality factor is infinite so that the modes
belong to the class of the so called bound states in the continuum or BICs, and
an analytical expression for the resonant frequency is found. These modes have
different multipolar symmetries, and we show that for high multipolar orders
the modes tend to localize at the border of the circumference, forming
therefore a whishpering gallery mode with an extraordinarily high quality
factor. Numerical experiments are performed to check the robustness of these
modes under different types of disorder and also to study their excitation from
the far field. Although we have focused our study to flexural waves, the
methodology presented in this work can be applied to other classical waves,

distribution, in particular when only a single data domain is available during
training. While test-time adaptation has yielded encouraging results in this
setting, we argue that, to reach further improvements, these approaches should
be combined with training procedure modifications aiming to learn a more
diverse set of patterns. Indeed, test-time adaptation methods usually have to
rely on a limited representation because of the shortcut learning phenomenon:
only a subset of the available predictive patterns is learned with standard
training. In this paper, we first show that the combined use of existing
training-time strategies, and test-time batch normalization, a simple
adaptation method, does not always improve upon the test-time adaptation alone
on the PACS benchmark. Furthermore, experiments on Office-Home show that very
few training-time methods improve upon standard training, with or without
test-time batch normalization. We therefore propose a novel approach using a
pair of classifiers and a shortcut patterns avoidance loss that mitigates the
shortcut learning behavior by reducing the generalization ability of the
secondary classifier, using the additional shortcut patterns avoidance loss
that encourages the learning of samples specific patterns. The primary
classifier is trained normally, resulting in the learning of both the natural
and the more complex, less generalizable, features. Our experiments show that
our method improves upon the state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks and
benefits the most to test-time batch normalization.

face recognition (AIFR) extracts identity-related discriminative features by
minimizing the correlation between identity- and age-related features while
face age synthesis (FAS) eliminates age variation by converting the faces in
different age groups to the same group. However, AIFR lacks visual results for
model interpretation and FAS compromises downstream recognition due to
artifacts. Therefore, we propose a unified, multi-task framework to jointly
handle these two tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn the age-invariant
identity-related representation for face recognition while achieving pleasing
face synthesis for model interpretation. Specifically, we propose an
attention-based feature decomposition to decompose the mixed face features into
two uncorrelated components -- identity- and age-related features -- in a
spatially constrained way. Unlike the conventional one-hot encoding that
achieves group-level FAS, we propose a novel identity conditional module to
achieve identity-level FAS, which can improve the age smoothness of synthesized
faces through a weight-sharing strategy. Benefiting from the proposed
multi-task framework, we then leverage those high-quality synthesized faces
from FAS to further boost AIFR via a novel selective fine-tuning strategy.
Furthermore, to advance both AIFR and FAS, we collect and release a large
cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations, and a new benchmark
specifically designed for tracing long-missing children. Extensive experimental
results on five benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate that MTLFace yields
superior performance for both AIFR and FAS. We further validate MTLFace on two
popular general face recognition datasets, obtaining competitive performance on
face recognition in the wild. Code is available at

stability and extraordinary electronic conductivity even higher than graphite
while its monolayer is semiconducting. In this work, via using first-principles
derived force constants and Boltzmann transport theory we explore the lattice
thermal conductivity ({\kappa}_l) of the monolayer {\gamma}-GeSe, together with
a comparison with monolayer {\alpha}-GeSe and {\beta}-GeSe. The {\kappa}_l of
{\gamma}-phase is relatively low (5.50 W/mK), comparable with those of
{\alpha}- and {\beta}- phases. The acoustic branches in {\alpha}-GeSe are well
separated from the optical branches, limiting scattering channels in the phase
space, while for \b{eta}-GeSe and {\gamma}-GeSe the acoustic branches are
resonant with the low-frequency optical branches facilitating more
phonon-phonon scattering. For {\gamma}-GeSe, the cumulative {\kappa}_l is
isotropic and phononic representative mean free path (rMFP) is the shortest
(17.07 nm) amongst the three polymorphs, indicating that the {\kappa}_l of the
{\gamma} phase is less likely to be affected by the size of the sample, while
for {\alpha}-GeSe the cumulative {\kappa}_l grows slowly with mean free path
and the rMFP is longer (up to 20.56 and 35.94 nm along zigzag and armchair
direction, respectively), showing a stronger size-dependence of {\kappa}_l. Our
work suggests that GeSe polymorphs with overall low thermal conductivity are
promising contenders for thermoelectric and thermal management applications.

functional two-dimensional (2D) contacts is indispensable. Herein, via
first-principles calculations, we propose the design of van der Waals
heterostructures (vdWHs) of Gamma-GeSe contacting respectively with graphene,
2D h-BN and MoS2, as representatives of metallic, insulator, and semiconductor
partners. Our work shows that the h-BN or graphene layer donates electrons to
the Gamma-GeSe layer, resulting in n doping in Gamma-GeSe, while the MoS2 layer
accepts electrons from the Gamma-GeSe layer leading to p doping of the latter.
The Gamma-GeSe/BN heterostructure has a type-I band alignment with large band
offsets, indicating that BN can be used as an effective passivating layer to
protect Gamma-GeSe from its environmental disturbance while maintaining its
major electronic and optical characteristics. For Gamma-GeSe/graphene
heterostructure, it is prone to have a very low-Schottky barrier down to tens
of meV, easily overcome by thermal excitation, which can be tunable by strain
and external electric field. The Gamma-GeSe/MoS2 vdWH forms a Z-scheme
interface, which is beneficial for carriers splitting and photon utilization.
Our work indicates that Gamma-GeSe can be well passivated by BN, and form
intimate contact with graphene for high charge injection efficiency and with
MoS2 for efficient carriers splitting for redox reactions.

  arXiv:2208.11925 by other authors",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The full compressible magnetohydrodynamic system in three-dimensional
exterior domains is investigated. For the initial-boundary-value problem of
this system with slip boundary condition for the velocity, adiabatic one for
the temperature, and perfect one for the magnetic field, the global existence
and uniqueness of classical solutions is established, under the condition that
the initial data are of small energy but possibly large oscillations. In
particular,the initial density and temperature are both allowed to vanish.
Moreover, the large-time behavior of the classical solutions is also obtained.

deals with problems derived from the questions and answers posted to websites
such as Quora or Stack Overflow. Among some of these problems we find the issue
of ranking the multiple answers posted in reply to each question by how
informative they are in the attempt to solve the original question. This work
tries to advance the state of the art on answer ranking for community Question
Answering by proceeding with a deep learning approach. We started off by
creating a large data set of questions and answers posted to the Stack Overflow
website.
  We then leveraged the natural language processing capabilities of dense
embeddings and LSTM networks to produce a prediction for the accepted answer
attribute, and present the answers in a ranked form ordered by how likely they
are to be marked as accepted by the question asker. We also produced a set of
numerical features to assist with the answer ranking task. These numerical
features were either extracted from metadata found in the Stack Overflow posts
or derived from the questions and answers texts. We compared the performance of
our deep learning models against a set of forest and boosted trees ensemble
methods and found that our models could not improve the best baseline results.
We speculate that this lack of performance improvement versus the baseline
models may be caused by the large number of out of vocabulary words present in
the programming code snippets found in the questions and answers text. We
conclude that while a deep learning approach may be helpful in answer ranking
problems new methods should be developed to assist with the large number of out
of vocabulary words present in the programming code snippets

  of Indian market: a complex networks perspective","17 pages, 21 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-fin.CP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Market competition has a role which is directly or indirectly associated with
influential effects of individual sectors on other sectors of the economy. The
present work studies the relative position of a product in the market through
the identification of influential spreaders and its corresponding effect on the
other sectors of the market using complex network analysis during the pre-,
in-, and post-crisis induced lockdown periods using daily data of NSE from
December, 2019 to June, 2021. The existing approaches using different
centrality measures failed to distinguish between the positive and negative
influences of the different sectors in the market which act as spreaders. To
obviate this problem, this paper presents an effective measure called LIEST
(Local Influential Effects for Specific Target) that can examine the positive
and negative influences separately with respect to any crisis period. LIEST
considers the combined impact of all possible nodes which are at most three
steps away from the specific targets for the networks. The essence of
non-linearity in the network dynamics without considering single node effect
becomes visible particularly in the proposed network.
